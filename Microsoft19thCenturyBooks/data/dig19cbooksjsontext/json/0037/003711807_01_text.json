The historians of kings, with a religious care, collect the first words, the first sentiments, and the first acls of their infancy: in the age of innocence, those great per sonages have not yet acquired the art of disguise ; and philosophy, more than once, has prognosticated what they would be on the throne, by what they have been in the nursery. The historians of free nations, ought not lo be less at tentive to collect whatever may throw light on the origin of their government, on the principles which have guided their legislators, and on the seeds of disease from which human prudence has never been able to guard entirely human institutions. The exhibition of such facts, im presses the mind with clear and achromatic ideas of the nature, action, and power of those political bodies, much better than the most elaborate dissertations. It is to increase that source of public instruction that a friend of American history, who long ago had secured in his port folio the original notes of Mr. Yates of the secret proceedings of the convention that framed the present constitution of the Uuiied States, has thought that it would be useful to give publicity to those authen tic documents, especially at a period when improve ments and alterations in the local constitution of one of the main pillars of ihe north American union, are about to be undertaken. These documents may serve to show the constitutional lines drawn by the true spirit of 1776, and patriotically defended by the old republicans of 1787; and account, in many respects, for a succession of events which are the natural if not the necessary results of a pre-existing order of things."], [12, "PREFACE. 6 Congress have lately caused to be published ihe jour nal of the form. if proceedings of tho federal convention ; but, if we are allowed to repeat what has previously been observed on that subject, in the proposals circulated for publishing the present collection, that official journal has left history in the dark as to the views of the legislators, and the principles upon which they acted : and it is in reality nothing but a diplomatic skeleton, deprived of its vital parts. Messrs. Hamilton, Jay, and Madison, in the numbers so well known under the title of the Federalist, which made their appearance previous to the interpolation of the ten declaratory and restrictive amendments, so for tunately insisted on by the States, have, it is (rue, entered inro ample discussions, and elaborate comments to assist the public judgment in the investigation of ihe plan of con stitution presented to the consideration of the States. But discussions and comments are not history ; and history is never more attractive than when il presents to us on tho scene, the actors of great transactions; opens, as it were, the doors of their most secret councils to the curiosity of the reader, and procures him, without the compulsion of a lite rary dictatorat, the pleasing task of judging for himself of public men and public measures.

The Genuine Information, delivered to the Legislature of the State of Maryland, relative to the Proceedings of the General Convention, held at Philadelphia, in 1787, by Luther Martin, Esquire, Attorney General of Maryland, and one of the Delegates in the said Con- vention. To the Hon. Thomas Cockey Deye, Speaker of the House of Delegates of Maryland. Sir: \u2014 I flatter myself the subject of this letter will be a sufficient apology for thus publicly addressing it to you, and through you to the other members of the House of De legates. It cannot have escaped your or their recollection, that when called upon as the servant of a free State, to ren der an account of those transactions in which I had had a share, in consequence of the trust reposed in me by that State, among other things, I informed them, \" that some time in July, the Hon. Mr. Yates and Mr. Lansing, of New York, left the Convention ; that they had uniformly op posed the system, and that I believe, despairing of getting a proper one brought forward, or of rendering any real ser vice, they returned no more.\" You cannot, sir, have for got, for the incident was too remarkable not to have made some impression, that upon my giving this information, the B"], [16, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 10 zeal of one of my honorable colleagues, in favor of a system which I thought it my duty to oppose, impelled him to in terrupt me, and in a manner which I am confident his zeal alone prevented him from being convinced was not the most delicate, to insinuate pretty strongly, that the statement which I had given of the conduct of those gentlemen, and their motives for not returning, were not candid. Those honorable members have officially given informa tion on this subject, by a joint letter to his excellency, Go vernor Clinton \u2014 it is published. Indulge me, sir, in giving an extract from it, that it may stand contrasted in the same page with the information I gave, and may convict me of the want of candor of which I was charged, if the charge was just \u2014 if it will not do that, then let it silence my ac cusers. \"Thus circumstanced, under these impressions, to have hesitated would have been to be culpable ; \u2014 we therefore gave the principles of the constitution, which has received the sanction of a majority of the convention, our decided and unreserved dissent. We were not present at the com pletion of the new constitution ; but before we left tho convention, its principles were so well established as to convince us, that no alteration was to be expected to con form it to our ideas of expediency and safety. A per suasion that our further attendance would be fruitless and unavailing rendered us less solicitous to return.\" These, sir, are their words ; on this I shall make no comment; I wish not to wound the feelings of any person, I only wish to convince. I have the honor to remain, With the utmost respect, Your very obedient servant, LUTHER MARTIN Baltimore, January 27, 178$."], [17, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 11 Mr. Martin, when called upon, addressed the hou\u00bbe nearly as follows : Since I was notified of ihe resolve of this honorable house, that we should attend this day, to give information with regard to the proceedings of the late convention, my time has necessarily been taken up with business, and I have also been obliged to make a journey to the East ern Shore. These circumstances have prevented me from being as well prepared as I could wish, to give the inform ation required : however, the few leisure moments I could spare, I have devoted to refreshing my memory, by look ing over the papers and notes in my possession, and shall, with pleasure, to the best of my abilities, render an ac count of my conduct. It was not in my power to attend the convention imme diately on my appointment. I took my seat, I believe, about the Sth or 9th of June. I found that Governor Randolph, of Virginia, had laid before the convention cer tain propositions for their consideration, which have been read to this house by my honorable colleague, and I be lieve he has very faithfully detailed the substance of the speech with which the business of the convention was open ed, for though I was not there at the time, I saw notes which had been taken of it. The members of the convention from the States, came there under different powers ; the greatest number, I be lieve, under powers nearly the same as those of the de legates of this State. Some came to the convention under the former appointment, authorizing the meeting of dele gates merely to regulate trade. Those of Delaware were expressly instructed to agree to no system which should take away from the States that equality of suffrage secured by the original articles of confederation. Before I arrived, a number of rales had been adopted to regulate the proceedings of the convention, by one of which, sevea"], [18, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 12 States might proceed to business, and, consequently, sour States, the majority of that number, might eventually have agreed upon a system which was to affect the whole Union. By another, the doors were to be shut, and the whole proceedings were to be kept secret ; and so far did this rule extend, that we were thereby prevented from cor responding with gentlemen in the different States upon the subjects under our discussion \u2014 a circumstance, sir, which I confess I greatly regretted \u2014 I had no idea, that all the wisdom, integrity, and virtue of this State, or of the others, were centred in the convention \u2014 I wished to have corresponded freely, and confidentially, with eminent po litical characters in my own, and other States, not impli citly to be dictated to by them, but to give their senti ments due weight and consideration. So extremely soli citous were they that their proceedings should not trans pire, that the members were prohibited even from taking copies of resolutions, on which the convention were deliber ating, or extracts of any kind from the journals without formally moving for, and obtaining permission, by a vote of the convention for that purpose. You have heard, sir, the resolutions which were brought forward by the honorable member from Virginia ; let me call the attention of this house to the conduct of Vir ginia ; when our confederation was entered into \u2014 that State then proposed, and obstinately contended, contrary to the sense of, and unsupported by, the other States, for an inequality of suffrage founded on numbers, or some such scale, which should give her, and certain other States, in fluence in the Union over the rest; pursuant to that spirit which then characterized her, and uniform in her conduct, the very second resolve is calculated expressly for that purpose, to give her a representation proportioned to her numbers, as if the want of that was the principal defect in our original system, and this alteration the great means of remedying the evils we had experienced under our pre sent government."], [19, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 13 The object of Virginia, and other large States, to in crease their power and influence over the others, did not escape observation : the subject, however, was discussed with great coolness in the committee of the whole house, (for the convention had resolved itself into a committee of the whole to deliberate upon the propositions delivered in by the honorable member from Virginia.) Hopes were formed, that the farther we proceeded in the examination of the resolutions the better the house might be satis fied of the impropriety of adopting them, and that they would finally be rejected by a majority of the committee; if on the contrary, a majority should report in their fa vour, it was considered, that it would not preclude the members from bringing forward and submitting any other system to the consideration of the convention ; and ac cordingly, while those resolves were the subject of dis cussion in the committee of the whole house, a number of the members who disapproved them, were preparing another system, such as they thought more conducive to the happiness and welfare of the States \u2014 The propositions originally submitted to the convention having been deba ted, and undergone a variety of alterations in the course of our proceedings, the committee of the whole house by a small majority agreed to a report, which I am happy, sir, to have in my power to lay before you ; it was as fol lows : 1. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that a national government ought to be established, con sisting of a supreme legislative, judiciary, and executive. 2. That the legislative ought to consist of two bran ches. 3. That the members of the first branch of the nation al legislature ought to be elected by the people of the se veral States, for the term of three years, to receive fixed stipends, by whieh they may be compensated for the de votion of their time to public service, to be paid out of the"], [20, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 14 national treasury, to be ineligible to any office estubhsh ed by a particular State, or under the authority of th# United States, except those particularly belonging to the functions of the first branch, during the terra of service, and under the national government, for the space of one year after its expiration. 4. That the members of the second branch of the legis lature ought to be chosen by the individual legislatures, to be of the age of thirty years at least, to hold their of fices for a term sufficient to ensure their independency, namely, seven years, one third to go out biennially, to receive fixed stipends, by which they may be compensa ted for the devotion of their time to public service, to be paid out of the national treasury, to be ineligible to any office by a particular State, or under tbe authority of the United States, except those peculiarly belonging to the functions of the second branch, during the term of service, and under the national government, for the space of one year after its expiration. 5. That each branch ought to possess the right of origi nating acts. 6. That the national legislature ought to be empower ed to enjoy the legislative rights vested in congress by the confederation, and moreover to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent, or in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted, by the exercise of individual legislation ; to negative all laws pass ed by the several States, contravening, in the opinion of the legislature of the United States, the articles of union, or any treaties subsisting under the authority of the Union. 7. That the right of suffrage in the first branch of the national legislature, ought not to be according to the rule es tablished in the articles of confederation, but according to some equitable rate of representation, namely, in propor tion to the whole number of white and other free citizens"], [21, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 15 and inhabitants of every age, sex, and condition, including those bound to servitude for a term of years, and three fifths of all other persons, not comprehended in the fore going description, except Indians not paying taxes in each Slate. 8. That the right of suffrage in the second branch of the national legislature, ought to be according to the rule es tablished in the first. 9. That a national execulive be instituted to consist of a single person, to be chosen by the national legislature for the term of seven years, with power to carry into execu tion the national laws, lo appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for, to be ineligible a second time, and to be removable on impeachment and conviction of malpractice or neglect of duty; to receive a fixed stipend, by which he may be compensated for the devotion of his time to public service \u2014 to be paid out of the national treasury. 10. That the national executive shall have a right to negative any legislative act which shall not afterwards be passed, unless by two-third parts of each branch of the na tional legislature. 11. That a national judiciary be established, to consist of one supreme tribunal, the judges of which, to be ap pointed by the second branch of the national legislature, to hold their offices during good behaviour, and to receive punctually, at stated times, a fixed compensation for their services, in which no increase or diminution shall be made, so as to affect the persons actually in office at the time of such increase or diminution. 12. That the national legislature be empowered to ap point inferior tribunals. 13. That the jurisdiction of the national judiciary shall extend to cases which respect the collection of the nation al revenue; cases arising under the laws of the United"], [22, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 16 States, impeachments of any national officer, and questions which involve the national peace and harmony. 14. Resolved, That provision ought to be made for the admission of States lawfully arising within the limits of the United States, whether from a voluntary junction of government, territory, or otherwise, with the consent of a number of voices in the national legislature less than the whole. 15. Resolved, That provision ought' to be made for the continuance of congress, and their authority and privile ges, until a given day after the reform of the articles of union shall be adopted, and for the completion of all their engagements. 16. That a republican constitution, and its existing laws, ought to be guaranteed to each State by the United States. 17. That provision ought to be made for the amend ment of the articles of union, whensoever it shall seem necessary. 18. That the legislative, executive, and judiciary pow ers, within the several States, ought to be bound by oath to support the articles of the Union. 19. That the amendments which shall be offered to the confederation by this convention, ought at a proper time or times, after the approbation of congress, to be submitted to an assembly or assemblies, recommended by the legis latures, to be expressly chosen by the people, to consider and decide thereon. These propositions, sir, were acceded to by a majority of the members of the committee \u2014 a system by which the large States were to have not only an inequality of suffrage in the first branch, but also the same inequality in the second branch, or senate ; however, it was not designed the second branch should consist of the same number as the first. It was proposed that the senate should consist of twenty eight members, formed on the following scale \u2014 Virginia"], [23, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 17 to send five, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts each fours South Carolina, Norih Carolina, Maryland, New York, and Connecticut two each, and the States of New Hamp shire, Rhode Island, Jersey, Delaware, and Georgia, each of them one; upon this plan, the three large Slates, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, would have thirteen senators out of twenty-eight, almost one half os the whole numbei \u2014 Fifteen senatots were to be a quorum to proceed to business ; ihose three States would, there fore, have thirteen out of lhat quorum. Having this ine quality in each branch of the legislature, it must be evi dent, sir, lhat they would make what laws they pleased, however injurious or disagreeable to ihe other States, and lhat they would always prevent the other Stales from mak ing any laws, however necessary and proper, if not agree able to the views of those three States \u2014 They were not only, sir, by ibis system, to have such an undue superioiity in making laws and regulaiions for the Union, but to have the same superiority in ihe appointment, of ihe president, the judges, and all other officers of government. Hence, these three Slates would, in realily, have ihe appointment of ihe president, judges, and ail the other officers. This president, and these judges, so appointed, we may be mo rally certain, would be citizens of one of those three Slates; and the president, as appointed by ihem, and a citizen of one of them, would espouse their interests and their views, when they came in competition with ihe views and inte rests of the other Stales. This president, so appointed by tho three large States, and so unduly under their influence, was to have a negative upon every law that should be pass ed, which, if negatived by him, was not to take effect, unless assented lo by i wo-thirds of each branch of the legis lature, a provision which deprived ten States of even tho faintest shadow of liberty ; for if they, by a miraculous unanimity, having all their members present, should out vote the other three, and pass a law contrary to their C"], [24, "18 SECRET PROCEEDINGS wishes, those , three large Stales need only procure the president to negative it, and thereby prevent a possibili ty of its ever taking effect, because the representatives of those three States would amount to much more than o'ne third (almost one half) of the representatives in each branch. And, sir, this government, so organized with all this undue superiority in those three large States, was, as you see, to have a power of negativing tiie laws passed by every Slate legislature in the Union. Whether, therefore, laws passed by the legislature of Maryland, New York, Connecticut, Georgia, or of any other of the ten States, for the regulation of their internal police should take effect, and be carried into execution, was lo depend on ihe good pleasure of the representatives of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. This system of slavery which bound hand and soot ten States in the Union, and placed them at the mercy of the other three, and under the most abject and servile subjec tion to them, was approved by a majority of the members of the convention, and reported by t lie committee. On this occasion, the house will recollect, lhat the con vention was resolved into a committee of the whole \u2014 of ibis committee Mr. Gorham was chairman. The honor able Mr. Washington was then on the floor, in the same situation with the other members of ihe convention at large, lo oppose any system he thought injurious, or to propose any alterations 01 amendments he thought benefi cial. To these propositions so reported by ihe committee, no opposition was given by that illustrious personage, or by the president of the State of Pennsylvania. They boih appeared cordially to approve them, and to give them their hearty concurrence ; yet this system, I am confident, Mr. Speaker, there is not a member in this house would advocate, or who would hesitate one moment in saying it ought to be rejected. I mention this circum stance in compliance with the duty I owe this honorable"], [25, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 19 body, not with a view to lessen those exalted characters, but to show. how far ihe greatest and best of men may be led to adopt very improper measures, through error in judg ment, state influence, or by other causes, and to show that it is our duty not to suffer our eyes to be so far daz zled by the splendor of names, as to run blind-folded into what may be our destinction. Mr. Speaker, I levere those illustrious personages as much as any man here. No man has a higher sense of the important services they have rendered this country. No member of the convention went there more disposed to pay a deference to their opinions: but I should little have deserved the trust ibis State reposed in me, if I could have sacrificed its dearest interests to my complaisance for their sentiments; When contrary lo our hopes it was sound, that a ma jority of ihe members of the convention had in the com mittee agreed lo the system, I have laid before you, we then thought it necessary to bring forward the proposi tions, which such of us who had disapproved the plan be fore had prepared \u2014 The members who piepared these re solutions were principally of (he Connecticut, New York, Jersey, Del-iware, and Maryland delegations. The hon orable Mr. Patterson, of the Jerseys, laid them before the convention; of these propositions I am in possession of a copy, which I shall beg leave to read to you. These propositions were referred to a committee of the whole house : unfortunately the New Hampshire delega tion had not yet arrived, and ihe sickness of a relatioa of the honorable Mr. M 'Henry, obliged him still to be ab sent, a circumstance, sir, which I considered much to be regretted, as Maryland thereby was represented by only two delegates, and they unhappily differed very widely in iheir sentiments. The result of the reference of these last propositions to committee, was a speedy and hasty determination to"], [26, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 20 reject them \u2014 I doubt not, sir, to those who consider them with attention, so sudden a rejection will appear surpri sing ; but it may be proper to inform you, that on our meeting in convention, it was soon found lhat there was among us ihree parties of very different sentiments and views. One party, whose object and wish it was to abolish and annihilate all State governments, and lo bring foiward one general government over this extensive continent, of a monarchical nature, under certain restrictions and limi tations. Those who openly avowed ibis senlinien! ware, it is true, but few, yet it is equally true, sir, that there was a considerable number who did not openly avow it, who were by myself, and many others of the convention, considered as being in reality favoreis of lhat senti ment, and acting upon those principles, covertly endeavo ring to carry into effect what they well knew openly and avowedly could not be accomplished. The second parly was not for the abolition of ihe State governments, nor for the introduction of a monarchical government under any form ; but they wished to estab lish such a system as could give iheir own States undue power and influence in the government over the other States. A third party was what I considered truly federal and republican; this party was nearly equal in number with the other two, and were composed of the delegations from Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and in part from Maryland ; also of somo individuals from other representations. This party, sir, were for proceeding upon terms of federal equality ; they were for taking our present federal system as the basis of their proceedings, and as far as experience had shown us that there were defects, to remedy those defects ; as far as experience had shown that other powers were necessary to the federal govern ment, to give those powers. They considered this the ob"], [27, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 21 ject for which they were sent by their States, and what their States expected from them ; they urged, that if af ter doing this, experience should show lhat there still were defects in the syslem (as no doubt there would be) the same good sense that induced ibis convention to be called, would cause the States, when they found it neces sary, to call another; and if lhat convention should act with the same moderation, the members of it would pro ceed lo correct such errors and defects as experience should have brought to light. That by proceeding in this train, we should have a prospect at length of obtain ing as perfect a system of federal government as the nature of things would admit. On the othei hand, if we, contra ry to the purpose for which we were entrusted, consider ing ourselves as master-builders, loo proud to amend our original government, should demolish it entirely, and eiect a new system of our own, a short time might show the new system as defective as the old, perhaps mote so: should a convenlion be sound necessary again, if the members ihereof, acting upon the same principles, instead of amending and correcting its defects, should demolish that entirely, and bring forward a third system, lhat also might soon be found no better than either of ihe former, and thus we might always remain young in government, and always suffering the inconveniencies of an incorrect, imperfect system. But, sir, the favorers of monarchy, and those who wished the total abolition of State governments, well knowing that a government founded on truly federal prin ciples, the basis of which were the thirteen State govern ments, preserved in full force and energy, would be destruc tive of their views; and knowing they were too weak in numbers, openly to bring forward their system, conscious also that the people of America would reject it if propo sed to them, joined their interest with that party, who* wished a system, giving particular Status tho power aind"], [28, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 22 influence over the others, procuring in return mutual sac rifices from them, in giving the government great and un defined powers as to its legislative and executive, well knowing that by departing from a federal system, they paved the way for their favorite object, the destruction of the State, governments, and the introduction of monarchy \u2014 and hence, Mr. Speaker, I apprehend, in u great mea sure, arose the objections of those honorable members, Mr. Mason and Mr. Gerry. In every thing that tended to give the large states power over the smaller, the first of those gentlemen could not sonjet he belonged to ihe an cient dominion, nor could the latter forget that he repre sented Old Massachusetts.; that part of the system which tended to give those states power over the others met with their perfect approbation ; but when they viewed it charged with such powers as woidd destroy all State go vernments, their own as well as the rest \u2014 when they saw a president so constituted as to differ from a monarch, scarcely but in name, and having it in his power to be come such in reality when he pleased ; they being repub licans and federalists, as far as an attachment to their own States would permit them, they warmly and zealously opposed those parts of the system. From these different sentiments, and from this combination of interest, J ap prehend, sir, proceeded the site of what was called the Jersey resolutions, and the report made by the committee of the whole house. The Jersey propositions being thus rejected, the con vention took up those reported by the committee, and proceeded to debate them by paragraphs; it was now that they who disapproved the report found it necesaiy to make a warm and decided opposition, which took place upon the discussion of the seventh resolution, which rela ted to the inequality of representation in the first branch, Those who advocated this inequality, urged, that when the articles of confederation were formed, it was only"], [29, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 23 from necessity and expediency that the States were admit ted each to have an equal vote ; but that our situation was now altered, and therefore those States who considered it contrary to their interest, would no longer flbide by it. \u2014 They said no State ought to wish to have influence in go vernment, except in proportion to what it contributes to it; that if it contributes but little it ought to have but a small vote ; that taxation and representation ought al ways to go together ; that if one Stale had sixteen times as many inhabitants as another, or was sixteen times as wealthy, it ought to have sixteen times as many votes ; that an inhabitant of Pennsylvania ought to have as much weight and consequence as an inhabitant of Jersey or Delaware ; that it was contrary to the feelings of the hu man mind; what the large States would nevir submit to; that the large States would h ive great, objects in view, in which they would never permit the smaller States to thwart them ; that equality of suffrage was the rotten part of the constitution, and that this was a happy time to get clear of it. In fine, that it was the poison which contami nated our whole system, and the source of all the evils we experienced. This, sir, is the substance of the arguments, if argu ments they may be called, which were used in favor of ine quality of suffrage. Those who advocated the equality of suffrage, took the matter up on the original principles of government ; they urged, that all men considered in a state of nature, before any government formed, are equal ly free and independent, no one hiving any right or autho rity to exercise power over another, and this without any regard to difference in personal strength, understand ing, or wealth \u2014 That when such individuals enter iuto government, they have each a right to an equal voice in its first formation, and afterwards have each a right to an equal vote in every matter which relates to their govern ment \u2014 That if it could be done conveniently, they have a"], [30, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 24 right to exercise it in person \u2014 Where it cannot be done in person but for convenience, representatives are ap pointed to act for them, every person has a right to an equal vote, in choasing that representative who is entrust ed to do for the whole, that which the whole, if they could assemble, might do in person, and in the transact ing of which each would have an equal voice \u2014 That if we were lo admit, because a man was more wise, more strong, or more wealthy, he should be entitled lo more votes than another, it would be inconsistent with the free dom and liberty of that ot/ter, and would reduce him to sla very. Suppose, for instance, ten individuals in a state of nature, about to enter into government, nine of whom are equally wise, equally strung, and equally wealthy, the tenth is ten times as wise, ten times as strong, or ten times as rich ; if for this reason he is to have ten votes for each vote of either of the others, the nine might as well have no vote at all, since though ihe whole nine might assent to a measure, yet the vote of the tenth would countervail, and set aside all their votes \u2014 If ibis tenth approved of what they wished to adopt, it would be well, hut if he disap proved, he could prevent it, and in the same manner he could carry into execution any measure he wished, con trary to the opinion of all the others, he having ten votes, and the other altogether but nine \u2014 It is evident lhat on these principles, the nine would have no will nor discretion of their own, but must be totally dependent on the will and discretion of the tenth, to him they would be as absolutely slaves as any negro is to his master \u2014 If he did not attempt to carry into execution any measuies injurious to the other nine, it could only be said that they had a good master, they would not be the less slaves, because they would be totally dependent on the will of another, and not on their own icitf\u2014 They might not feel their chains, but they would notwithstanding wear them, and whenever their master pleased he might draw them so tight as to gall"], [31, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 25 them lo the bone. Hence it was urged, the inequality of representation, or giving to one man more votes than an other on account of his wealth, &c. was Altogether incon sistent with the principles of liberty, and in the same pro portion as it should be adopted, in favor of one or more, in that proportion are the others enslaved. It was urged, that though every individual should have an equal voice in the government, yet, even the superior wealih, strength, or understanding, would give great and undue advanta ges to those who possessed them. That wealth attracts respect and attention ; superior strength would cause the weaker and more feeble to be cautious how they offended, and to put up with small injuries rather than to engage in an unequal contest \u2014 in like manner superior under standing would give its possessor many opportunities of profiling at the expense of the more ignorant. Having thus established these principles with respect to the rights of individuals in a state of nature, and what is due to each on entering into government, principles established by every writer on liberty, they proceeded to show that states when once formed, are considered, with respect to each other, as individuals in a state of nature; that like indivi duals, each state is considered equally free and equally in dependent, the one having no right to exercise authority over the other, though more strong, more wealthy, or abounding with more inhabitants. That when a number of states unite themselves under a federal government, the same principles apply to them as when a number of indivi dual men unite themselves under a state government; that every argument which shows one man ought not to have more votes than another, because he is wiser, stronger, or wealthier, proves that one state ought not to have more votes than another, because it is stronger, richer, or more populous; and that by giving one state, or one or two states more votes than the others, the others thereby are enslav ed to such state or states, having the greater number of D"], [32, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 26 votes, in the same manner as in the case before put of in- dividuals when one has more votes than the others. That the reason why each individual man in forming a stato government should have an equal vote is, because each individual before he enters into government, is equally free and independent ; so each state, when states entir into a federal government, aie entitled lo an equal vote, be- cause before tln-.y entered into such federal government, each state was equally free and equally independent ; that adequate representation of men formed into a state govern- ment, consists in each man having an equal voice, eii her per- sonally, or if by representatives, that lie should have an equal voice in choosing (die repiesriitatixrs ; so adequate representation of slates ii/a federal government, consists in Cffc/i stale having an equal voice, either in person or by ils representative in every ihiug which relates to ihe federal go\\iTiimen \u25a0; that ibis adequacy iff representation is more important in a federal, than in n state, government, because ihe members us a stale government, the district of which is nut very large, have generally such a common interest, ilia: laws can scarcely be made by one pint oppressive lo the others, without 'heir suffering in common ; but '.l.e dif ferent states composing an extensive fideral impiie, wide- ly distant one fioni the other, may have interests so totally distinct, that the one part niipb.t |.e gieatly benefitted by ivhai would be destructive to the other. They were not satisfied by resting it on principles; they also appealed to history ; they showed lhat in the nni|ihvctioiiic confedenilioii of ihe Grecian cities, each city, however different in wealth, strength, and other cir cumstances, sent ihe same number us de; uties, and had each an equal voice in every ihing lhat related lo the com mon concerns of (,' recce. Il was shown that in ihe seven provinces of ihe United Nelhei lands, and ihe confederated cantons of Swi zeiland, each can/on, and each province, lavo au equal vote, al. hough there are as great disiinc-"], [33, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 27 tions of wealth, strength, population, and extent of ter ritory am >ng those provinces and those cantons, n* among these States. It was s dd, lhat the maxim that taxation and representation ought to go together, xvas true so far that no poison ought to be taxed who is not represented, but not in ihe extent insisted upon, to wit, -that the quan tum of taxation and representation oughl lo be ihe same; on the contrary, ihe quantum of representati.ni depends upon the qi liitu u of freed mt, anil there-ore alt, whether iiilivilual states, or individiu.il men, who are ejually free, hue a right to epul representation \u2014 Tii it to those who indst t 111 t he who pays the greatest share of iaxes, ought to have the greatest number of votes ; it is a sufficient answer lo siv, tint this rule would be destructive of ihe liberty of the others, an. I would render them staves to ihe mire rich and wealthy \u2014 That if one man pays more taxes thin unit-bar, it is because he his more wealth to be pro tected by government, and he receives greater benefits from the government \u2014 Sa if one Stale pays more lo the federal government, it is because as a State, she enjoys greater blessings from il ; she has more wealth project ed by it, or a greater number of inhabitants, xvhose rights are secured, and who share its advantages. Il was u ged that upon these principles the Poiins)lva nian, or inhabitant of a large State, xvas of as much con sequence as the inhabitant of Jersey, Delaware, Mary land, or any other Stale \u2014 That his conseqmnce was to be decided by his situation in his own State; that if he xvas there as free, if he had as great share in the forming of his own government, and in the making ami executing its laws, as the inhabitants of those other States, ihen xvas he eqi illy important and of equ il consequence \u2014 Suppose a confederation of States had never been adopted, but eve ry Slate had remained absolutely in its independent situa tion, no person could with propriety, say that the citizen of ihe large State was not as important as the citizen oT"], [34, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 28 the smaller, the confederation of the States cannot alter the case. It was said, that in all transactions between State and State, the freedom, independence, importance, and consequence, even the individuality of each ci izen of the different States, might with propriety be said to be swallowed up, or concentrated in the independence, the freedom, and the individuality of the State of xvhich they are citizens \u2014 That the thirteen States are thirteen distinct poli tical individual existences, as to each other ; that the federal government is or ought to be a government over these thir teen political individual existences, which form the mem bers of that government ; and that as the largest State is only a single individual of this government, it ought to have only one vote; the smallest State also being one individual member of this government, ought also to have one vote. To those who urged that the States have equal suffrage was contrary to the feelings of the human heart, it was answered, that it xvas admitted to be contrary to the feel ings of pride and ambition ; but those were feelings which ought not to be gratified at the expense of freedom. It was urged, that the position that great States would have great objects in view, in which ihey would not suf fer the less States to thwart them, was one of the strong est reasons why inequality of representation ought not to be admitted. If those great objects were not inconsistent with the interest of the less States, they xvould readily concur in them, but if they were inconsistent with the in terest of a majority of the States composing the govern ment, in that case two or three States ought not to have it in their power to aggrandize themselves at the expence of all the rest. To those who alleged that equality of suf frage in our federal government, was the poisonous source from which all our misfortunes flowed, it was answered, that the allegation was not sounded in fact ; that equality of suffrage had never been complained of by the States as a defect in our federal system ; that among the eminent"], [35, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 29 writers, foreigners, and others, xvho had treated of (he de fects of our confederation, and proposed alteiations, none had proposed an alteration in this part of the system; and members of the convention, both in and out of congress, who advocated the equality of suffrage, called upon their opponents both in and out of congress, and challenged them to produce one single instance where a bad measure had been adopted, 01 a good measure had failed of adoption in consequence of the States having an equal vote ; on the contrary, they urged, that all our evils floxved from the want of power in the federal head, and lhat let the right of suffrage in the States be altered in any manner what ever, if no greater powers were given to the government, the same inconveniencies would continue. It was denied that the equality of suffrage was originally agreed to on principles of necessity or expediency, on the contrary, that il was adopted on the principles of the rights of men and the rights of States, xvhich were then well known, and which then influenced our conduct although now they seem to he forgotten \u2014 For this the journals of congress were appealed to; it was from them shoxvn, that xvhen the committee of congress reported to that bo dy the articles of confederation, the very first article which became the subject of discussion, xvas lhat respec ting equality of suffrage \u2014 That Virginia proposed divers modes of suffrage, all on the principle of inequality, which were almost unanimously rejected ; that on the question for adopting the article, it passed, Virginia being the on ly State which voted in the negative \u2014 That after the ar ticles of confederation were submitted to the States by them to be ratified, almost every State proposed certain amendments, xvhich they instructed their delegates to en deavor to obtain before ratification, and that among all the amendments proposed, not one State, not even Virgi nia, proposed an amendment of that article, securing she equality of suffrage \u2014 the most convincing proof it was"], [36, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 30 agreed to and adopted, not from necessity, but upon a full conviction, lhat according to the principles of free govern ment, the Stales had a right to that equality of suffrage. Bui, sir, it was to no purpose that the futility of their objections were shown \u2014 xvhen driven from the pretence that ihe equality of suffrage hid been originally agreed to on principles of expediency and necessity, the represeiir tatives of the large States persisting in a declaration, that they xvould never agree to admit the smaller Stales to an ejualiti/ of suffrage*\u2014 An ansxver to this, they xvere inform ed, and insorme I in terms the most strung an I energetic that coul I possibly be used, ill u we. never w nil I ajree to a system giving them the undue influence and superiority they proposed \u2014 That xve xvould risk every possible consequent-* \u2014 That from anarchy and confusion order might arise \u2014 That slavery xvas the wmst thai could en sue, and xve considered the system proposed to be tho most complete, most abject system o! slavery lhat the xvit of m in ever devised, under the pretence of forming a government for free Slates \u2014 That xve never xvould submit tamely and servilely lo a present certain evil in diead of a future, xvhich might be imaginary ; that xve xvere sen sible the eyes of our country and ihe xvorld xvere upon us \u2014 That xve would not labor under the imputation of being unwilling to form a strong and energetic federal government ; but we xvould publish the S3'stem which xve approved, and also that xvhich xve opposed, and leave it to our country and ihe xvorld al large to judge belxveen us, who best understood ihe lights of free men a*d free states, and who best advocated them; and to the same tribunal we xvould submit, who ought lo be answerable for all lho consequences which might arise to the Union from ihe convention breaking up, without proposing any system to their constituents. During this debate, xve were threat- ened, that if xve did not agree to the system proposed, we never should have an opportunity of meeting in convention-"], [37, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 31 to deliberate on another, and this xvas frequently urged. In answer, xve called upon ihem to show what was to prevent it, and sioin xvhat quarter xvas our danger to proceed ; xvas it from a foreign enemy? Our distance from Europe, and the political situation of lhat country, left us but little lo fear : Was ihere any ambitious Slate or Slates, who in vio lation of every sacred obligation xvas preparing to enslave the other States, and raise itself to consequence on the ruin of the others 1 Or was there any such ambitious individual? We did no! apprehend il to be ihe case: but suppose it lo be true, it rendered it the more necessary ilia! we should sacredly guard against a system xvhich might enable all all those ambitious views to be carried into effect, even under the sanction of the constitution aud government : in sine, sir, all these threats xvere Healed xviib contempt, aud they xvere told that xve appi (bended but one reason to pre vent ihe Suites meeting again in convention ; that when they discovered ihe pail this convention had acted, and how much its members were abusing the trust reposed in them, (he Slates wuuld never trust another conxenlioii. At leiiglii, sir, after every Argument had Leen exhausted \u25a0by ihe advocates of equality of representation, the ques tion xvas called, -when a majority derided in favor of ihe inequality \u2014 Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Caiolinii, Smut I \u25a0 Carolina, and Georgia, voting lor it\u2014 \u25a0Connecticut, Nexv York, Nexv Jersey, and Del.nvme, against it; Mankind divided. It may be thought sur prising, sir, ihat Georgia; a Slate now small, and compa ratively trifling in the Union, should advocate this system of unequal representation, giving up her present equality in the federal government, and sinking herself almost to total insignificance in the scale; but, sir, it must bo considered that Georgia has the most extensive terri tory in the Union, being larger than the whole island of Great Britain, and thirty times as large as Connecticut. This system being desigued to preserve to the States their"], [38, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 32 whole territory unbroken, and to prevent tbe erection of nexv Stales xvithin the territory of any of them : Georgia looked forward when her population being increased in some measure proportioned to her territory, she should rise in the scale, and give late to the other States, and hence we found ihe delegation of Georgia warmly advo- cating the proposition of giving the States unequal re- presentation. Next day the question came on with re- spect to tbe inequality of representation in the second branch, but little debate took place; the subject had been exhausted on the former question. On the votes being taken, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, voted for the in- equality. Connecticut, New York, Nexv Jersey, Dela- ware, and Maryland,* were in the negative. Georgia had only two representatives on the floor, one of whom (not I believe because he was against the measure, but from a conviction that we would go home, and thereby dissolve the convention, before xve would give up the question) voted also in the negative, by which that State was divided. Thus, sir, on this great and important part of the system, the convention being equally divided, five States for the measure, five against, and one divided, there was a total stand, and xve did not seem very likely to proceed any further. Al length it xvas proposed, that a select committee should be ballotted for, composed of a member from each State, xvhich committee should en deavor to devise some mode of conciliation or compro mise ; I had the honor to be on that committee ; we met and discussed tho subject of difference ; the one side in sisted on the inequality of suffrage in both branches, the \u2022 On this question, Mr. Martin was the ogly delegate for Maryland prestnt, which \u2022.\u2022imunstance secured (he State a negative. Immediately alter the question had been taken, and the president had declared ihe votes, Mr. Jenifer came mio the convention, when Mr. King, from Massachu. si/Us, valuing himself on Mr. Jenifer to divide the State of Marx land on this question, as he had on the former, requested of the president lhat the question might be put again\u2014 however, the motion was too extraordinary m ita nature to meet with auocees,"], [39, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 33 other insisted on the equality in both ; each party was tenacious of their sentiments, when it was found lhat nothing could induce us to yield ihe inequality in both branches ; they at length proposed, by way of compro mise, if xve xvould accede to their wishes as to ihe first branch, they would agree lo the equal representation in the second. To this it was ansxvered thai there xvas no merit in the proposal ; it was only consenting, after I hey hid striiEsirled to put both their j'eet on our necks, to take one of them off, provided xve xvould consent lo let them keep the other on, xvhen l hey knexv at the same lime, lhat they could not pill one foot on our necks, unless xve xvould consent to it, and tint by b-ing permitted lo keep on that one foot, they should ulieixvards be able to place the oilier foot on xvhenever they pleased. They xvere also called on to inform us what security they could give us, should xve agree to this compromise, th il they xvould abide by the plan of government formed upon it, any longer than it suited their interests, or ibey found it expedient. \" The Slates b ive a right lo an equal by of representation.

It xvas further observed, thai the inequality of the representation xvould be daily increasing \u2014 That many of the States xvhose territory xvas confined, and xxhose population xvas at this time large in proportion to their territory, xvould probably txventy, lliirly, or forty years hence, have no more representatives than at the intro duction of the government, whereas ihe States having ex tensive territory, where lands are to be procured cheap, would be daily increasing in the number of their inhabi tant, not only fioni propagalioe, but from tho emigraiion ofthe inhabitants of the other Slates, and would have soon double;,, or perhaps treble the number of representatives that, they are to have al first, and thereby enormously in crease*their ..influence in the na ion-d counc Is.

Mr. Speaker, I think it my duty to observe,, that dor* ing this struggle to prevent ihe large States front having all power in their hands, xvhich had nearly terminated irt a dissolution of the convention, it did not appear to me*, that either of those illustrious characters, the honorable Mr. Washington, or the president of ihe State of Petit** sxlvania^ were disposed to favor the claims of the sntntiist Slates, against the undue superiority' attempted by the large States; on the conlrary, the honorable president of"], [42, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 36 Pennsylvania, was a member of the comm'tfre of compro mise, and there advocat d he right o' (he large States to an inequality in both branches, and Only u'timalely conced ed it in the second brinch on the principle of conciliation, when it xvas found no other terms xxou'd be accep ed. \u2014 This, sir, I ihink it my duty to mention, for the cuisi'cra tion us those who endeavor (o prop up a dangerous and defective system by gnat names; soon after his period, the honorable Mr. Yates and M>r. Lansing, o' Nexv Yoik, left us; they hud uniformly opposed the system, and I believe, despa'uing of gelling a proper one hi ought for ward, or of rendering any real service, they returned no more. The propositions reported by the committee of the whole house, having been fully discussed by the con vention, and with many alterations having bei n agreed to by a majority, a lommittee of five xvere appointed lo detail the system accoidine lo the principles contained in xvhat had been agreed to by thai majority; this xvas like ly to requira some time, and ihe convention adjourned for eight or ten days.

But, sir, the same spirit xvhich caused our doors to be shut\u2014 our proceedings to be kept secret\u2014 our journals to be locked up \u2014 and every avenue, as far as pos sible, to be shut to public information, prevailed also in this case, and the proposal so reasonable and necessary was rejected by a majority of ihe convention ; thereby preclu ding even the members themselves fiom ihe necessary means ef information, and deliberation on the important business in which they were engaged."], [43, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 37 It has been ob e:ved, Mr. Speaker, by my honorable colleagues, that the debate respecting the mode of repre sentation, was productive of considerable warmih \u2014 This observation is true. But, sir, it is equally true, lhat if we could hive tamely and servilely consented to be bound in chains, and meanly condescended to assist in rivetiing (hem fast, we might have avoided all that xvarmih, and have proceeded with as much calmness and coolness as sinv stoic could have xvished.

[Here Mr. Martin read the first section of the first article, and then proceeded.] With respect to this part of the system, Mr. Speaker, there was a diversity of sentiment ; those who xvere for two branches in ihe legislature, a house of representa tives, and a -senate, urged the necessity of a second branch to serve as a check upon the first, and used all those trite and common-place arguments which may bo proper and just, wh**-n applied to the formation of a state government over individuals variously distinguished in their habits and manners, fortune and rank ; xvhere a body chosen in a select manner, respectable for their wealth and dig nity, maybe necessary, frequently to prevent, the hasty and rash measures of a representation more popular ; but on the other side it was urged, that none of those argu ments could wilh propriety be applied to tbe formation of a federal government over a number of independent states\u2014 that it is the State governments which are to xvatch over and protect the rights of tho individual, xvhether rich or poor, or of moderute circumstances, and in which the democratic and aristocratic influence or principles are to be so blend ed, modified, and checked, as to prevent oppression and in-"], [44, "38 SECRET PROCEEDINGS jury\u2014 That the federal government is to guard and pro- tect the States and their rights, and to regulaie their com- mon concerns \u2014 Thai a federal government is foi nied by ihe Stales, as Stales, thai is in their sovereign capacities, in the same manner as treaties and alliances are foilned \u2014 that a sovereignty, considered us such, cannot be said to have jarring interests or principles, the one aristocratic, and ihe other democratic ; but that ihe principles of a sove- reignly considered as a sovereignly, are the same whether that sovereignty is monarchical, arislocratical, demoerali- cal, 01 mixed \u2014 that the history of mankind doth not furnish an instance from iis earliest '.period lo ihe present time, of a federal government constituted of two distinct branches \u2014 that ihe membeis of the federal government, if appointed by .the States in their State capacities, that is by their le gislatures, as they ought, would be select in llieir choice, and coming from different Stales, having dissereul interests and views, this difference of inleiesls and views xvould al- xvays be a sufficient check over ihe whole ; and it xvas shown, that even Adams, xvho the reviewers have justly observed, appears to be as fond of checks and balances as Lord Ches- terfield of the graces, even he declares lhat a council con- sisting of one branch has alxvays been found sufficient in a federal government. It xvas urged, that the government xve xvere forming was not in reality a federal but a national government, not founded on the principles of (he preservation, but the abolition or consolidation of all State governments \u2014 That we appeared totally to have forgot the business for which we were sent, and the situation of the country for which we were preparing our system\u2014 That xve had not been sent to form a government over the inhabitants of America, considered as individuals ; that as individuals they were all subject to their respective Slate governments, which go vernments xvould still remain, though the fedeiul govern ment should bo dissolved\u2014 That the system of government"], [45, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 39 we were entrusted to prepare, was a government over these thirteen Slates ; but that in our proceedings, we adop ted principles which would be right and proper, only on the supposition that there were no State governments at all, but that all the inhabitants of this extensive continent xvere in their individual capacity, without government, and in a stale of nature \u2014 That accordingly the system proposes the legislature to consist of two branches, the one to be drawn from the people at large, immediately in their individual capacity ; the other lo be chosen in a more select manner, as a check upon the first \u2014 It is in its very introduction de clared to be a compact belxveen the people of the United Stales as individuals ; and it is to be ratified by the peo ple at large in their capacity as individuals ; all xvhich it was said, xvould be quite right and proper, if iheie xvere no State governments, if all the people of ibis continent were in a state of nature, and xve xvere forming one national government for them as individuals, and is nearly the same as xvas done in most of the Slates, xvhen they formed their governments over ihe people xvho compose them. Whereas it was urged, that the principles on xvhich a federal government over states ought lo be constructed and ratified are ihe reverse; lhat instead of the legisla ture consisting of two branches, one branch xvas sufficient, whether examined by the dictates of reason, or ihe expe rience of ages\u2014 That the representation instead of being draxvn from the people at large as individuals, ought lobe draxvn from the States, as Stales \\.\\ their sovereign capacity \u2014That in a federal government, the parties to the com pact are not the people as individuals, but the States as States, and thai it is by the States as States in their sove reign capacity, that ihe system of government ought to he ratified, and not by the people as individuals.

To prove this, mid ihe senate as constituted could not be a security for the protection and preservation of the State governments, ami that the senators could not be justly considered the representatives of the States as States, it was observed, that upon just principles of representation, the representative ought lo speak the sentiments of his con stituents, and ought to vote in the same manner that his constituents would do, (as far as he can judge,) provided his constituents xvere acting in person, and had the same knoxvledye and information with bin self; and, therefore, that the representative ought to be dependent on his con stituents, and answerable to them ; that . the connexion Le.* ween the representative and ihe represented, ought to bo as near and us close us possible; according to these princi ples, Mr. Speaker, in this Stale, it is piovided by its con stitution, that the representatives in congress shall be chosen annually, shall be paid by the State, and .shall be subject to recal even within the year; so cautiously has our constitution guarded against an abuse of the trust re posed in our representatives in the federal government ; whereas by the third and sixth *Ht\\on of the first article of this new system, the senators are to be chosen for six years, instead of being chosen annually; instead of being paid by iheir States who send them, they, in ronjiinrtinn wiih the other branch, are to pay themselves out of the treasury of the United States, aud are not liable to be recalled"], [47, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 41 during the period for which they are chosen : Thus, sir, for six years the senators are rendered totally and abso lutely independent of their States, of xvhom they ought to be the representatives, xvithout any bond or tie between them. During that time they may join in measures ruinous and destructive to their States, even such as should totally anni hilate their Stale governmeits, and their States cannnot recal them, nor exercise any control over them. Another con sideration, Mr. Speaker, it was thought ought to have great weight to prove that the smaller States cannot depend on the senate for the preservation of their rights, either against large and ambitious States, or against an ambitious, , asp ring president. Tho senate, sir, is so constituted, that they are not only to compose one branch of the legislature, but by the second section of the second article, they are to compo-ie aprivy council for the president ; hence, it will be necessity, that they should be, in a great measure, a per manent body, constantly residing at the seat of government. Seven years is esieemed for the life of a man ; it can hardly be supposed, that a senator, especially from \"the Slates remote from the seat of empire, xvill accept of an appointment xvhich must estrange him for six years from his State, without giving up to a great degree his pros- pects in his own Slate.

It was insisted that governments of a republican nature, are those best calculated to preserve the freedom and happiness of the citizen \u2014 That governments of this kind are only calculated for a territory but small in its extent ; that the only method by which an extensive continent like Ame rica could be connected and united together consistent with the principles of freedom, must be by having a num ber of strong and energetic State governments for securing and protecting the rights of individuals forming thoso governments, and for regulating all their concerns; and a strong energetic federal government over those States for the protection and preservation, and for regulating the common concerns of ihe state. It xvas further insist ed, that even if it xvas possible lo effect a total abolition of the Stale governments at this lime, and lo establish one general government over the people of America, it could not long subsist, but in a little time xvould again be broken into a variety of governments of a smaller extent, similar in some manner 10 the present situation of this continent ; the principal difference in all probability would be that the governments, so established, being af fected by some violent convulsion, might not be formed on principles so favorable to liberty as ihose of our present State governments \u2014 That this ought to be an important consideration to such of the States who had excellent go vernments, which was the case with Maryland and most others, whatever it might be to persons who disapproving of their particular State government would be willing to hazard every thing to overturn and destroy it. These reasons, sir, influenced me to vote against two branches in the legislature, and against every part of the system which was repugnant to the principles of a federal go-"], [51, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 4& vernment\u2014 Nor was there a single argument urged, or reason assigned, which to my mind was satisfactory, to prove that a good government on federal principles was unattainable, the whole of their arguments only proving, what none of us controverted, lhat our federal govern ment, as originally formed, w s defective, and wanted amendment \u2014 However, a majority of the convention has tily and inconsiderately, xvilhout condescending to make a fair trial, in their great wisdom, decided that a kind of go vernment xvhich a Montesquieu and a Price have declared tbe best calculated of any to preserve internal liberty, and to enjoy external strength and security, and ihe only one by which a large continent can be connected and united, con sistent xvith the principles of liberty, xvas totally impracti cable, and they acled accordingly. With respect to that part of the second section of the first article, xvhich relates to the apportionment of repre sentation and direct taxation, there were considerable ob jections made to it, besides the great objection of inequa lity \u2014 It was urged that no principle could justify taking slaves into computation in apportioning the number of re presentatives a State should have in the government \u2014 That it involved the absurdity of increasing the poxver of a State in making laxvs for free men in proportion as that State violated the rights of freedom\u2014 That it might be pro per lo take slaves into consideration, when taxes were to be apportioned, because it had a tendency to discourage slavery ; but to lake them into account in giving repre sentation, tended to encourage the slave trade, and lo make it ihe interest of ihe States lo continue that infamous traf fic \u2014 That slaves could not be taken into account as men, or citizens, because they xvere not admitted to the rights of citizens, in the States xvhich adopted or continued sla very \u2014 If they were to be taken into account as property, it was asked, what peculiar circumstance should render this property (of all others the most odious in its nature) en-"], [52, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 46 titled to the high privilege of conferring consequence and power in the government to its possessors, rather [hap any other property : and why slaves should, as property, be taken into account rather than horses, cattle, mules, or any other species; and it xvas observed by an honorable member from Massachusetts, lhat he considered it as dishonorable and humiliaing lo enter inlo compact with the slaves of the southern States, (is it xvould with the horses and mules of the eastern. It xvas i Iso objected, that ihe numbers of representatives appointed by this section to be sent by the particular Stales lo compose the fust legislature, xvere noi precisely agreeable lo ihe rule of re presentation adopted by this system, and that the num bers in ibis section are artful/y lessened lor ihe large Sine s, while the smaller States have (heir full proportion, in o dcr to prevent die undue influence xvhich ihe large S ales xvill have in the govern m nt from being too apparent ; and I think, Mr. Speaker, that ibis objection is will fnundtd. I have taken some pains to obtain information of the num ber of freemen and slaves in (he d ffeient Slates, and I have reason to believe, that if the estimale was now taken, which is directed, and one delegate to be sent for every thirty thousand inhabitants, that Viiginia would have at least twelve delegates, Massachusetts eleven, and Penn sylvania ten, instead of the number stated in this section; whereas the other States, I believe, would not have more than the number there allowed them, nor xvould Georgia, most probably, al present, send more than two \u2014 if I am right, Mr. Speaker, upon the enumeration being made, and the representation being appottioned according to , the rule presc.ibed, the whole number of delegates xvould be seventy-one, thirty-six of xvhich xvould be a quorum to do business : the delegates of Virginia, Mass ichuseits, and Pennsylvania, would amount to thirty-three of that quorum \u2014 Those three States xvill, therefore, have much more than equal power and influence in making tho law*"], [53, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 47 and regulations, which are to affect this continent, and xvill have a mornl certainty of preventing any laws or re- gulations xvhich they disapprove, although they mighl be thought ever so necessary by a great majority of the States \u2014 It xvas fiiribei objected, lhat even if the Stoles xvbo had most inhabitants ought to have a greater number of ileleeatcs, yet ihe number of delegates ought not to bo in ex'ict proportion to the number of inhabitants, because the influence and power of those Slates xvhose delegates are numerous, xvill be greater when compared to ihe in- fluence and power of ihe other States, than the proportion xvhich the nulnbeis of llieir delegatps bear lo each other ; as for instance, though Dclaxvare has one delegate, and Virginia but ten, yet Virginia has more (ban ten times as much power and influence in the government as Dela- ware; to prove this, it xvas observed that Virginia xvould have a much greater chance to cany any measure than any number of States xvhose delegates xvere altogether ten, (suppose the States of Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Now Hampshire,) since the ten delegates from Virginia, in every thing thai related to the interest of that Stale xvould act in union, and move one solid anrl compact body, xvhereas ihe delegates of these four Stales, though coll. ctively equal in number lo those from Virginia, com- ing from different Stales, having different interests, xvill be less likely to Imrniun zo and move in concert. As a further proof, it xvas said, lhat Virginia, as the system is now repotted, by uniting with lit-t ihe delegates of four oilier Stales, can cany a question against the sense and in- terest of ihe eight Stales, by sixty-four different combina- tions ; the four Slates voting with Virginia, being every time so far different as no! lo be composed of ihe same four ; xxhereas the State of Delaivare can only, by uniting soiir other Stales wi'h her, carry a measure against the sense of eight States by tieo different combinations \u2014 a mathemat- ical proof that tho Stato of Virginia has tkirty-4wo timos"], [54, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 48 greater chance of carrying a measure against the sense of eight States, than Delaware, although Virginia has only ten times as many delegates. It was also shown, that the idea was totally fallacious which was attempted to bo maintained, that if a State had one thirteenth part of the numbers composing the delegation in this system, such State would have as much influence as under the articles of con federation ; to prove the fallacy of this idea it xvas shown, thai under the articles of confederation the State of Mary land had but one vote in thirteen, yet no measure could be carried against her interests xvithout seven States, a majority of the whole concurring in it; whereas in this system, though Maryland has six votes, which is more than the proportion of one in thirteen, yet five Stales may, in a variety of combinations, carry a question against her interest, though seven other Stales concur xvith her, and six States, by a much greater number of combinations, may carry a measure against Maryland, united xvith six other States. I shall here, sir, just obseive, that as ihe committee of detail reporled the system, the delegates from the different States xvere to be one for every forty thousand inhabitants; it was afterxvards altered to one for every thirty thousand ; ibis alteration xvas made after I left the convenlion, at the instance of whom I know not; but it is evident that the alteration is in favor of the States xvhich have large and extensive territory, to in crease their poxver and influence in ihe government, and Xo the injury of the smaller States \u2014 since it is the States .of extensive territory, xvho xvill most speedily increase the number of their inhabitants, as before has been observed, and will therefore most speedily procure an increase to the number of their delegates. By this alteration, Virginia, North Carolina, or Georgia, by obtaining one hundred and twenty thousand additional inhabitants, xvill be enti- tled to four additional delegates, whereas such State would only have been entitled to three, if forty thousand\""], [55, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 49 had remained the number by xvhich to apportion the dele gation. As to that part of this section that relates to di rect taxation, there xvas also an objection for the follow ing reasons: it was said that a large sum of money was to be brought into the national treasury by the duties on commerce, which would be almost wholly paid by the com mercial States ; it would be unequal and unjust that the sum xvhich was necessary to be raised by direct taxation should be apportioned equally upon all the States, obliging the commercial States to pay as large a share of the reve nue arising therefrom, as the States from whom no reve nue had been drawn by imposts ; since the wealth and industry of the inhabitants of the commercial States will in the first place be severely taxed through their com merce, and afterwards be equally taxed with the industry and xvealth of the inhabitants of the other States, who have, paid no part of that revenue, so that by this provision, the inhabitants of the commercial States are in this sys tem obliged to bear an unreasonable and disproportionate share in the expenses of the union, and the payment of that foreign and domestic debt, which was incurred not more for the benefit of the commercial than of the other States. In the sixth section of the first article, it is provided, that senators and representatives may be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States, except such as shall have been created, or the emolu ments of which have been increased during the time for which they were elected : upon this subject, sir, there was a great diversity of sentiment among the members of the convention \u2014 As the propositions were reported by the committee of the whole house, a senator or represen tative could not be appointed to any office under a parti cular State, or under the United States, during the time for which they were chosen, nor to any office under the United States until one year after the expiration of that G"], [56, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 50 time \u2014 It was said, and in my opinion justly, that no good reason could be assigned why a senator or repre sentative should be incapacitated to hold an office in his own government, since it can only bind him more close ly to his State, and attach him the more to its interests, which, as its representative, he is bound to consult and sacredly guard, as far as is consistent with the welfare of the union; and therefore, at most, would only add the additional motive of gratitude for discharging his duty ; and according to this idea, the clause which prevented senators or delegates from holding offices in their own States, was rejected by ' a considerable majority ; but, sir, we sacredly endeavored to preserve all that part of the resolution which prevented them from being eligible to offices under the United States, as we considered it essentially necessary to preserve the integrity, independ ence and dignity of the legislature, and to secure its mem bers from corruption. 1 was in the number of those who were extremely so licitous to preserve this part of the report ; but there was a powerful opposition made by such who wished the members of the legislature to be eligible to offices under the United States \u2014 Three different times did they attempt to procure an alteration, and as often failed, a majority firmly adhering to the resolution as reported by the committee ; hoxvever, an alteration was at length, by dint of perseverance, obtained even within the last twelve days of the convention, for it happened after I left Philadelphia \u2014 As to the exception that they cannot be appointed to offices created by themselves, or the emoluments of which are by themselves increased, it is certainly of little consequence, since they may easily evade it by creating new offices, to which may be ap pointed the persons who fill the offices before created, and thereby vacancies will be made, which may be filled"], [57, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 51 by the members who for that purpose have created the new offices. It is true, the acceptance of an office vacates their seat, nor can they be re-elected during their continuance in office ; but it was said, that the evil would first take place;* that the price for the office would be paid before it was obtained ; that vacating the seat of the person who was appointed to office, made way for the admission of a new member, who would come there as desirous to obtain an office as him whom he succeeded, and as ready to pay the price necessary ;to obtain it ; in fine, that it would be only driving away the flies who were filled, to make room for those that xvere hungry \u2014 And as the sys tem is now reported, the president having the power to nominate to all offices, it must be evident, that there is no possible security for the integrity and independence of the legislature, but that they are most unduly placed under the influence of the president, and exposed to bribery and corruption. The seventh section of this article was also the subject of contest \u2014 It was thought by many members of the con vention, that it was very wrong to confine the origination of all revenue bills to the house of representatives, since the members of the senate xvill be chosen by the people as well as the members of the house of delegates, if not im mediately, yet mediately, being chosen by the members of the State legislature, which members are elected by tbe people, and that it makes no real difference whether we do a thing in person, or by a deputy, or agent appointed by us for that purpose. That no argument can be drawn from the house of lords in the British constitution, since they are neither me diately nor immediately the representatives of the people, but are one of the three estates, composing that kingdom, having hereditary rights and privileges, distinct from, and independent of, the people."], [58, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 52 That it may and probably will be a future source of dispute and controversy between the txvo branches, xvh; t are, or are not revenue bills, and the more so, as they are not defined in the constitution ; which controversies may be difficult to settle, and may become serious in their con sequences, there being no power in the constitution to decide upon, or authorised in cases of absolute necessity to terminate them by a prorogation or dissolution of either of the branches ; a remedy provided in the British constitution, where the king has that poxver, which has been found necessary at times to be exercised in case of violent dissentions between the lords and commons on the subject of money bills. That every regulation of commerce, every law rela tive to excises, stamps, the post-office, the imposing of taxes, and their collection ; the creation of courts and of fices ; in fine, every law for the union, if enforced by any pecuniary sanctions, as they would tend to bring money into the continental treasury, might, and no doubt would, be considered a revenue act ; that consequently the senate, the members of xvhom will, it may be presumed, be the most select in their choice, and consist of men the most enlightened, and of the greatest abilities, who from the duration of their appointment, and the permanency of their body, will probably be best acquainted with the common concerns of the States, and with the means of providing for them, will be rendered almost useless as a part of the legislature : and that they will have but little to do in that capacity, except patiently to wait the proceedings of the house of representatives, and afterwards examine and ap prove, or propose amendments. There were also objections to that part of this section which relates to the negative of the president. There were some who thought no good reason could be assigned for giving the president a negative of any kind \u2014 Upon the principle of a check to the proceedings of the legislature,"], [59, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 53 it was said to be unnecessary ; that the two branches having a control over e;.ch other's proceedings, and the senate be ing chosen by the State legislatures, and being composed of members from the different States, there would alxvavs he a sufficient guard against measures being hastily or rashly adopted. That the president was not likely to have more wisdom or integrity than the senators, or any of them, or to better know or consult the interest of the States, than any mem ber of the senate, so as to be entitled to a negaiive on that principle \u2014 And as to the precedent from the British con stitulion (for xve were eternally troubled xvith arguments and precedents from the British government) it was said it would not apply. The king of Great Britain there composed one of the three estates of the kingdom ; he was possessed of rights and privileges as such, distinct from the lords and commons; rights and privileges which descended to his heirs, and were inheritable by them ; that for the preservation of these it xvas necessary he should haxre a ne gative, but that this was not the case with the president of the United States, who was no more than an officer of government, the sovereignty was not in him, but in the legis lature. And it xvas further urged, even if he xvas allowed a negative, it ought not to be of so great extent as that given by the system, since his single voice is to countervail the whole of either branch, and any number less than two thirds of the other ; however, a majority of the convention was of a different opinion, and adopted it as it now makes a part of the system. By the eighth section of this article, congress is to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and ex cises. When we met in convention after our adjournment, to receive the report of the committee of detail, the mem bers of that committee were requested to inform us, xvhat powers were meant to be vested in congress by the word duties in this section, since the word imposts extended"], [60, "54 SECRET PROCEEDINGS to duties on goods imported, and by another part of the system no duties on exports xvere to be laid. In answer to this inquiry, xve xvere informed, that it was meant to give the general government the power of laying stamp duties on paper, parchment, and vellum. We then pro posed to have the poxver inserted in express words, least disputes hereafter might arise on the subject, and that the meaning might be understood by all who were to be affected by it ; but to this it xvas objected, because it was said that the xvord stamp would probably sound odiously in the ears of many of the inhabitants, and be a cause of objection. By the power of imposing stamp duties, the congress will have a right to declare, that no wills, deeds, or other instruments of writing, shall be good and valid, without being stamped \u2014 that without being reduced to writing, and being stamped, no bargain, sale, transfer of property or contract of any kind or nature whatsoever, shall be binding; and also that no exemplifications of re cords, depositions, or probates of any kind, shall be receiv ed in evidence, unless they have the same solemnity. \u2014 They may likexvise oblige all proceedings of a judicial nature to be stamped, to give them effect \u2014 Those stamp duties may be imposed to any amount they please, and under the pretence of securing the collection of these duties, and to prevent the laws which imposed them from being evaded, the congress may bring the decision of all ques tions relating to the conveyance, disposition, and rights of property, and every question relating to contracts between man and man, into the courts of the general government \u2014 their inferior courts in the first instance, and the supe rior court by appeal. By the power to lay and collect imposts, they may impose duties on any or every article of commerce imported into these States to what amount they please. By the power to lay excises, a power very odious in its nature, since it authorizes officers to go into your kouses, your kitchens, your cellars, and to examine into"], [61, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 55 your private concerns, the congress may impose duties on every article of use or consumption, on the food that we eat, on the liquors we drink, on the clothes that xve wear, the glass xvhich enlighten our houses, or the hearths necessary for our warmth and comfort. By the power to lay and collect taxes, they may proceed to direct taxation on every individual, either by a capitation tax on their heads, or an assessment on their properly. By this part of the section therefore, the government has power to lay what duties they please on goods imported ; to lay what duties \u2022they please afterwards on whatever we use or consume ; -to impose stamp duties to what amount they please, and in whatever case they please : afterwards to impose on the people direct taxes, by capitation tax, or by assessment, to what amount they choose, and thus to sluice them at every vein as long as they have a drop of blood, without any controul, limitation, or restraint ; while all the officers for collecting these taxes, stamp duties, imposts, and ex cises, are to be appointed by the general government, un der its directions, not accountable to the States ; nor is there even a security that they shall be citizens of the respective States, in which they are to exercise their offices; at the same time the construction of every law imposing any and all these taxes and duties, and directing the collec tion of them, and every question arising thereon, and on the conduct of the officers appointed to execute these laws, and to collect these taxes and duties so various in their kinds, are taken away from the courts of justice of the different States, and confined to the courts of the general government, there to be heard and determined by judges holding their offices under the appointment not of the States, but of the general government. Many of the members, and myself in the number, thought that the States were much better judges of the cir cumstances of their citizens, and what sum of money could be collected from them by direct taxation, and of"], [62, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 56 the manner in which it could be raised, with the greatest ease and convenience to their citizens, than the general government could be ; and that the general government ought not to have the poxver of laying direct taxes in any case, but in that of the delinquency of a State \u2014 Agreeable to this sentiment, I brought in a proposition on which a vote of the convention was taken, the proposition was as folloxvs : \" And whenever the legislature of the United States shall find it necessary that revenue should be rais ed by direct taxation, having apportioned tbe same by the above rule, requisitions shall be made of the respective States to pay into the continental treasury their respec tive quotas, within a time in the said requisition to be specified, and in case of any of the States failing to com ply with such requisition, then and then only, to have pow er to devise and pass acts directing the mode and author ising the collection of the same.\" Had this proposition been acceded to, the dangerous and oppressive power in the general government of imposing direct taxes on the in habitants, which it now enjoys in all cases, would have been only vested in it, in case of the non-compliance of a State as a punishment for its delinquency, and would hav\u00a3 ceased the moment that the State complied with the requi sition \u2014 But the proposition was rejected by a majority, consistent with their aim and desire of increasing the pow er of the general government as far as possible, and destroy ing the powers and influence of the States. And though there is a provision that all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform, that is, to be laid to tbe same amount on the same articles in each State, yet this will not pre vent congress from having it in their power to cause them to fall very unequal and much heavier on some States than on others, because these duties may be laid on arti cles but little or not at all used in some States, and of abso lute necessity for the use and consumption of others, in which case the first would pay little or no part of the re-"], [63, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 57 venue arising therefrom, while the whole or nearly tho whole of it would be paid by the last, to wit, the States xvhich use and consume the articles on xvhich the imposts and excises are laid. By our original articles of confederation, the congress have a poxver to borrow money and emit bills of credit on the credit of the United States ; agreeable to which was the report on this system as made by the committee of detail. When we came to this part of the report, a mo tion xvas made to strike out the words \" to emit bills of credit;\" against the motion we urged, that it would be improper to deprive the congress of that power; that it would be a novelty unprecedented to establish a govern ment which should not have such authority \u2014 That it was impossible to look forward into futurity so far as to de cide, that events might not happen that should render the exercise of such a power absolutely necessary \u2014 And that we doubled, whether if a war should take place it would be possible for this country to defend itself, without having recourse to paper credit, in which case there would be a necessity of becoming a prey to our enemies, or vio lating the constitution of our government ; and that con sidering the administration of the government would bo principally in the hands of the wealthy, there could be little reason to fear an abuse of the power by an unneces sary or injurious exercise of it \u2014 But, sir, a majority of the convention, being wise beyond every event, and be ing willing to risk any political evil rather than ad mit the idea of a paper emission, in any possible case, re fused to trust this authority to a government, to which they xvere lavishing the most unlimited powers of taxa tion, and to the mercy of which they were willing blindly to trust the liberty and property of the citizens of every State in the union ; and they erased that clause from the system. Among other poxvers given to this government in the eighth section, it has that of appointing tribunals II"], [64, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 58 inferior to the supreme court ; to this power there was an opposition. It was urged, that there was no occasion for inferior courts of the general government to be ap pointed in the different States, and that such ought not to be admitted\u2014 That the different Stale judiciaries in the respective States would be competent to, and sufficient for, the cognizance in the first instance of all cases that should arise under the laws of the general government, which being by this system made the supreme law of the States, xvould be binding on the different State judicia ries\u2014That by giving an appeal to the supreme court of the United States, the general government xvould have a sufficient check over their decisions, and security for the enforcing of their laxvs \u2014 That to have inferior courts ap pointed under the authority of congress in the different States, would eventually absorb and sxvalloxv up the State judiciaries, by drawing all business from them to the courts of the general government, which the extensive and undefined poxvers, legislative and judicial, of which it is possessed, xvould easily enable it to do \u2014 That it would unduly and dangerously increase the weight and influ ence of congress in the several States, be productive of a prodigious number of officers, and be attended with an enormous additional and unnecessary expense \u2014 That the judiciaries of the respective States not having power to decide upon the laxvs of the general government, but the determination of those laws being confined to the judi ciaries appointed under the authority of congress in the first instance as well as on appeal, there would be a ne cessity for judges or magistrates of the general govern ment, and those to a considerable number, in each county of every State \u2014 That there would be a necessity for courts to be holden by them in each county, and that these courts would stand in need of all the proper officers, such as sheriffs, clerks and others, commissioned under the authority of the general government: in fine, that the"], [65, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 59 administration of justice, as it will relate to the laws of the general government, would require in each State all the magistrates, courts, officers and expense, which is now found necessary in the respective Slates for the ad ministration of justice as it relates to the laws of the State governments. But here again we xvere overruled by a majority, who assuming it as a principle that the general government and the State governments (\"as long as they should exist) would be at perpetual variance and enmity, and that their interests would constantly be op posed to each other, insisted for that reason that the State judges being citizens of their respective States, and holding their commissions under them, ought not, though acting on oath, to be entrusted in the administration of the laws of the general government. By the eighth section of ihe first article, the congress have also a poxver given them to raise and support ar mies without any limitation as to numbers, and without any restriction in time of peace. Thus, sir, this plan of government, instead of guarding against a standing ar my, that engine of arbitrary power, which has so often and so successfully been used for the subversion of free dom, has in its formation, given it an express and consti tutional sanction, and hath provided for its introduction ; nor could this be prevented : I took the sense of the con vention on a proposition, by which the congress should not have poxver, in time of peace, to keep embodied more than a certain number of regular troops \u2014 that number to be ascertained by what should bo considered a respecta ble peace establishment This proposition was rejected by a majority, it being their determination, that the power of congress to keep up a standing army, even in peace should only be restrained by their will and plea sure. This section proceeds further to give a power to the congress to provide for the calling forth the militia, to"], [66, "SECRET PROCEEDING 60 execute the laws of the union, suppress insuireefRms n-uJ repel invasions. As to giving such a power there wa* no objection ; but it xvas thought by some, that this pow er ought to be given with certain restrictions. It xvas thought that not more than a certain part of the militia of any one State, ought to be obliged to march out of the same, or be employed out of the same, at any one time, without the consent of the legislature of such State. This amendment I endeavored to obtain ; but it met with the same fate which attended almost every attempt to limit the powers given to the general government, and consti tutionally to guard against their abuse, it xvas not adopt ed. As it now stands, the congress will have the poxver, if they please, to march the whole militia of Maryland to the remotest parts of the union, and keep them in ser vice as long as they think proper, without being in any respect dependent upon the government of Maryland for this unlimited exercise of power over its citizens. All of whom, from the lowest to the greatest, may, during such service, be subjected to military law, and tied up and whip ped at the halbert like the meanest of slaves. By the next paragraph, congress is to have the power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be em ployed in the service of the United States. For this extraordinary provision, by which the militia, the only defence and protection xvhich the State can have for the security of their rights against arbitrary encroach ments of the general government, is taken entirely out of the power of their respective States, and placed under the power of congress. It xvas speciously assigned as a reason, that the general government would cause the militia to be better regulated and better disciplined than the State gov ernments, and that it would be proper for the whole mi litia of the union to have a uniformity in their arms and exercise. To this it was answered, that the reason how-"], [67, "OF TIIF FEDERAL CONVENTION. 6l ever specious, xvas not just ; that it xvould be absurd the militia of the western settlements, who were exposed to an Indian enemy, should either be confined to ihe same arms or exercise, as the militia of the eastern or middle States; that the same penalties which would be sufficient to enforce an obedience to mililia laxvs in some States, would be totally disregarded in others \u2014 That leaving the poxver to the several States, they would respectively best know the siluation and circumstance of iheir citir.cns, and the regulations lhat xvould be necessary mid suffi cient to effect a xvell regulated militia in each \u2014 That xve were satisfied the militia had heretofore been as xvell dis ciplined, as if they had been under the regulations of con gress; and that the States would now have an additional motive to keep their militia in pioper order and sit for service, as it xvould be the only chance to preserve their existence against a general government, armed with pow ers sufficient lo destroy them. These observations, sir, procured from some of ihe members an open avowal of those reasons, by xvhich we believed before that they were actuated. They said, that as the States would be oppos ed to the general government, and at enmity xvith il, which, as I have already observed, they assumed as a principle, if the militia xvas under the control and the au thority of the respective States, it xvould enable them to thwart and oppose ihe general government: \u2014 They said the States ought to be at the mercy of the general go vernment, and, therefore, that the militia ought to be put under its power, and not suffered to remain under the poxver of the respective States. In answer to these de clarations, it was urged, that if after having retained to the general government the great powers already gran# ed, and among those, that of raising and keeping up regu lar troops without limitations, the poxver over the militia should be taken axvay from the States, and also given to the general government, it ought to be considered as the"], [68, "62 SECRET PROCEEDINGS last coup tie grace, to the State governments ; that it must be the most convincing proof, the advocates of this system design the destruction of the State governments, and that no professions, to the contrary, ought to be trusted ; and that every State in the union ought to reject such a sys- tem with indignation, since, if the general government should attempt to oppress and enslave them, they could not have any possible means of self-defence; because the proposed system, taking away from the States the right of organizing, arming, and disciplining of the militia, the first attempt made by a State to put the militia in a situ- ation to counteract the arbitrary measures of the general government, would be construed into an act of rebellion or treason ; and congress would instantly march their troops into the State. It xvas further observed, that xvhen a government wishes to deprive their citizens of free- dom, and reduce them to slavery, it generally makes use of a standing army for that purpose, and leaves the mili- tia in a situation as contemptible as possible, least they might oppose Us arbitrary designs \u2014 That in this system, we give the general government every provision it could wish for, and even invite it to subvert the liberties of the States and their citizens, since xve give them the right to increase and keep up a standing army as numerous as it would wish, and by placing the militia under its power, enable it to leave the militia totally unorganized, undisci plined, and even to disarm them ; while the citizens, so far from complaining of this neglect, might even esteem it a favor in the general government, as thereby they would be freed from the burden of militia duties, and left to their own private occupations or pleasures. However, \u25a0all arguments, and every reason that could be urged on this subject, as xvell as on many others, were obliged to yield to one that was unanswerable, a majority upon the division. By the ninth section of this article, the importation of"], [69, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 63 such persons as any of the States now existing, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten dollars for each person. The design of this clause is to prevent the general go vernment from prohibiting the importation of slaves, but the same reasons xvhich caused them to strike out the word \" national,\" and not admit the xvord \" stamps,\" in fluenced them hereto guard against the word \"slaves.\" They anxiously sought to avoid the admission of expres sions which might be odious in ihe ears of Americans, al though they xvere willing to admit into their system those things xvhich the expressions signified : and hence it is, that the clause is so worded as really to authorize the general government to impose a duly of ten dollars on every for eigner xvho comes into a State to become a citizen, xvhethcr he comes absolutely free, or qualifiedly so as a servant; al though this is contrary to the design of the framers, and the duty was only meant to extend to the importation of slaves. This clause was ihe subject of a great diversity of senti ment in the convention ; as the system was reported by the committee of detail, the provision was general, that such importation should not be prohibited, without confining it to any particular period. This was rejected by eight States \u2014 Georgia, South Carolina, and I think North Caro lina voting for it. We were then told by the delegates of the two first of those States, that their States xvould never agree to a system which put it in the poxver of the general government to pre vent the importation of slaves, and that they, as delegates from those States, must withhold their assent from such a system. A committee of one member from each State was cho sen by ballot, to take this part of the system under their"], [70, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 64 consideration, and to endeavour to agree upon some re port, which should reconcile those States ; to this com mittee also was referred the following proposilion, which had been reporled by the committee of detail, to wit : \" No navigation act shall be passed without the assent of two thirds of the members present in each house ;\" a proposition which the staple and commercial States were solicitous to retain, lest their commerce should be placed too much under the power of the eastern States, but which these last States were as anxious to reject. \u2014 This committee, of which also I had the honor to be a member, met and took under their consideration the subjects committed to them. I found the eastern States, notwithstanding their aversion to slavery, were very willing to indulge the southern States, at least with a temporary liberty lo prosecute the slave trade, provided the southern States would in their turn gratify them by laying no restriction on navigation acts ; and after a very little time, the committee, by a great majority, agreed on a report, by which the general government was to be pro hibited from preventing the importation of slaves for a limited time, and the restrictive clause relative to navi gation acts was to be omitted. \u25a0 This report was adopted by a majority of the conven tion but not without considerable opposition. \u2014 It was said, that we had just assumed a place among indepen dent nations, in consequence of our opposition to the at tempts of Great Britain to enslave us; that this opposi tion was grounded upon the preservation of those rights, to which God and nature had entitled us, not in particu lar, but in common with all the rest of mankind \u2014 That we had appealed to the Supreme Being for his assistance, as the God of freedom, who could not but approve our efforts to preserve the rights which he had thus imparted to his creatures ; that now, when we scarcely had risen from our knees, from supplicating his aid and protection \u2014 in"], [71, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 65 sunning our government over a free people, a government formed pretendedly on the principles of liberty and for its preservation \u2014 in that government to have a provision not only putting it out of its power to restrain and prevent the slave trade, even encouraging that most infamous traffic, by giving the States power and influence in the union, in proportion as they cruelly and wantonly sport with the rights of their fellow creatures, ought to be considered as a solemn mockery of, and insult to that God whose protec tion we had then implored, and could not fail to hold us up in detestation, and render us contemptible to every true friend of liberty in the world. It was said, it ought to be considered that national crimes can only be, and frequent ly are, punished in this world by national punishments, and that the continuance of the slave trade, and thus giving it a national sanction and encouragement, ought to be consider ed as justly exposing us to the displeasure and vengeance of him, who is equally Lord of all, and who views with equal eye, the poor African slave, and his American master ! It was urged, lhat by this system, we were giving the general government full and absolute power to regulate commerce, under which general power it would have a right to restrain, or totally prohibit the slave trade; it must therefore, appear to the world absurd and disgrace ful to the last degree, that we should except from the ex ercise of that power, the only branch of commerce which is unjustifiable in its nature, and contrary to the rights of mankind \u2014 That on the contrary we ought rather to prohi bit expressly in our constitution, the further importation of slaves ; and to authorize the general government from time to time, to make such regulations as should be thought most advantageous for the gradual abolition of slavery, and the emancipation of 'the slaves which are already in the States. That slavery is inconsistent with the genius of republic eanisnt, and has a tendency to destroy those principles on I"], [72, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 66 which it is supported, as it lessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind, and habituates us to tyranny and op pression. It was further urged, that by this system of government, every State is to be protected both from foreign invasion and from domestic insurrections ; that from this consideration, it was of the utmost importance it should have a power to restrain the importation of slaves, since in proportion as the number of slaves were increased in any State, in the same proportion the State is weakened and exposed to foreign invasion, or domestic insurrection, and by so much less will it be able to pro- tect itself against either ; and therefore will* by so much the more, want aid from, and be a burthen to, the union. It was further said, that as in this system we were giving the general government a power under the idea of nation- al character, or national interest, to regulate even our weights and measures, and have prohibited all possibility of emitting paper money, and passing insolvent laws, fye. it must appear still more extraordinary, that we should prohibit the government from interfering with the slave trade, than which nothing could so materially affect both our national honor and interest. \u2014 These reasons influenc- ed me both on the committee and in convention, most de- cidedly to oppose and vote against the clause, as it now makes a part of the system. You will perceive, sir, not only that the general gov ernment is prohibited from interfering in the slave trade before the year* eighteen hundred and eight, but that there is no provision in the constitution that it shall afterwards be prohibited, nor any security that such prohibition will ever take place \u2022; aad I think there is great reason to be lieve that if the importation of slaves is permitted until the year eighteen hundred and eight, it will not be pro hibited afterwards: At this time we do not generally hold this commerce in so great abhorrence as we have done \u2014 When our liberties were at stake, we warmly felt"], [73, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 67 for the common rights of men \u2014 The danger being thought to be past which threatened ourselves, we are daily growing more insensible to those rights \u2014 In those States who have restrained or prohibited the importation of slaves, it is only done by legislative acts which may be re pealed \u2014 When those States find that they must in their na tional character and connexion suffer in the disgrace, and share in the inconveniencies attendant upon that detestable and iniquitous traffic, they may be desirous also to share in the benefits arising from it, and the odium attending it will be greatly effaced by the sanction which is given to it in the general government. By the next paragraph, the general government is to have a power of suspending the habeas corpus act, in cases of rebellion or invasion. As the State governments have a power of suspend ing the habeas corpus act in those cases, it was said, there could be no reason for giving such a power to the general government, since, whenever the Stale which is invaded, or in which an insurrection takes place, finds its safety requires it, it will make use of that power \u2014 And it was urged, that if we gave this power to the gen eral government, Jt would be an engine of -oppression in its hands, since whenever a State should oppose its views, however arbitrary and unconstitutional, and refuse sub mission to them, the general government may declare it to be an act of rebellion, and suspending the habeas cor pus act, may seize upon the persons of those advocates of freedom, who have had virtue and resolution enough to excite the opposition, and may imprison them during it* pleasure in the remotest part of the union, so that a citi zen of Georgia might be bastiled in the farthest part of New Hampshire, or a citizen of New Hampshire in the farthest extreme to the south, cut off from their family, their friends, and their every connexion \u2014 These consider-"], [74, "68 SECRET PROCEEDINGS aiions induced me, sir, to give my negative also lo ihL\u00ab clause. In this same section there is a provision that no prefe rence shall be given to the ports of one State over another, and that vessels bound to or from one State shall not bo obliged to enter, clear, or pay duties in another. This provision, as well as that which relates to the uniformity of impost duties and excises, was introduced, sir, by the dele gation of this State \u2014 Without such a provision, it would have been in the power of the general government to have compelled all ships sailing into, or out of the Chesapeake,* to clear and enter at Norfolk, or some port in Virginia \u2014 a regulation which would be extremely injurious to our commerce, but which would, if considered merely as to the interest of (he union, perhaps not be thought unreasonable, since it would render the collection of the revenue arising from commerce more certain, and less expensive. But, sir, as the system is now reported, the general government have a power to establish what ports they please in each State, and to ascertain at what ports in every State ships shall clear and enter in such State ; a power which may be so used as to destroy the effect of that provision, since by it may be established a port in such a place, as shall bo so inconvenient to the Slates, as to ren der it more eligible for their shipping to clear and enter in another, than in their own States. Suppose, for instance, the general government should determine, that all ships which cleared or entered in Maryland, should clear and enter at Georgetown, on Potomac, it would oblige all the ships which sailed from, or were bound to, any other port of Maryland, to clear or enter in some port in Virginia. To prevent such a use of the power which the general go vernment now has of limiting the number of ports in a State, and fixing the place or places where they shall be, we en deavored to obtain a provision, that the general govern-"], [75, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 69 ineru should only, in the tirst instance, have authority to ascertain the number of ports proper to be established in each State, anil transmit information thereof to the seve ral States, the legislatures of which, respeciively, should have the power to six the places where those ports should be, according to their idea what would be most advan tageous to the commerce of their State, and most for the case and convenience of their citizens; and that the general government should not interfere in the establishment of the places, unless the legislature of the State should neg lect or refuse so to do ; but we could not obtain this alter ation. By the tenth section every State is prohibited from emit ting bills of credit \u2014 As it was reported by the committee of detail, the States were only prohibited from emitting them without the consent of congress: but the convention was so smitten wilh the paper money dread, that they in sisted the prohibition should be absolute. It was my opinion, sir, that the States ought not to be totally depriv ed of the right to emit bills of credit, and that as we had not given an authority lo the general government for that purpose, it was the more necessary to retain it in the States. I considered that this State, and some others, have former ly received great benefit from paper emissions, and that if public and private credit should once more be restored, such emissions may hereafter be equally advantageous ; and further, that it is impossible to foresee that events may not take place which shall render paper money of absolute necessity ; and it was my opinion, if this power was not to be exercised by a State without the permission of the gene ral government, it ought to be satisfactory even to those who were the most haunted by the apprehensions of paper money ; I therefore thought it my duty to vote against this part of the system. The same section also, puts it out of the power of the States, to make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender"], [76, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 70 in payment of debts, or to pass any law impairing the obli- gation of contracts. I considered, sir, that there might be times of such great public calamities and distress, and of such extreme scarcity 6f specie, as should render it the duty of a go vernment, for the preservation of even the most valuable part of its citizens, in some measure to interfere in their favor, by passing laws totally or partially stopping the courts of justice, or authorizing the debtor to pay by in stalments, or by delivering up his property lo his creditors at a reasonable and honest valuation. The times have been such as to render regulations of this kind necessary in most, or all of the States, to prevent the wealthy credir tor and the moneyed man from totally destroying the poor, though even industrious debtor \u2014 Such times may again arrive. I therefore voted against depriving the States of this power \u2014 a power which I am decided they ought to possess, but which I admit ought only to be exercised on very important and urgent occasions. I apprehend, sir, the principal cause of complaint among the people at large is, the public and private debt with which they are oppress ed, and which, in the present scarcity of cash, threatens them, with destruction, unless they can obtain so much in dulgence in point of time, that by industry and frugality they may extricate themselves. This government proposal, I apprehend', so far from removing, will greatly increase those complaints, since grasping in its all powerful hand the citizens of the respec tive Slates, it will, by the imposition of the variety of tax es, imposts, stamps, excises, and other duties, squeeze from them the little money they may acquire, the hard earnings of their industry, as you would squeeze the juice from an orange, till not a drop more can be extracted, and then let loose upon them their private creditors, to whose mercy it consigns them, by whom their property is to be seized upon and sold in this uarcity of specie at a sheriff's sale."], [77, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 71 where nothing but ready cash can be received for a tenth part of its value, and themselves and their families to be consigned to indigence and distress, without their govern ments having a power to give them a moment's indulgence, however necessary it might be, and however desirous to .grant them aid. By this same section, every State is also prohibited from laying any imposts, or duties on imports or exports, without the permission of the general government. It was urged, that as almost all sources of taxation were given to congress, it would be but reasonable to leave the States the power of bringing revenue into their treasuries, by laying a duty on exports, if they should think proper, which might be so light as not to injure or discourage industry, and yet might be productive of considerable re venue \u2014 Also that there might be cases in which it would be proper, for the purpose of encouraging manufactures, to lay duties to prohibit the exportation of raw materials, and even in addition to the duties laid by congress on imports for the sake of revenue, to lay a duty to discour age the importation of particular articles into a State, or to enable the manufacturer here to supply us on as good terms as they could be obtained from a foreign market ; however, the most we could obtain was that this power might be exercised by the States with, and only with the consent of congress, and subject to its controul \u2014 And so anxious were they to seize on every shilling of our money for the general government, that they insisted even the little revenue that might thus arise, should not be appro priated to the use of the respective States where it was col lected, but should be paid into the treasury of the United States; and accordingly it is so determined. The second article relates to the executive \u2014 his mode of election \u2014 his powers \u2014 and the length of time he should \u25a0continue in office. On these subjects there was a great diversity of senti-"], [78, "72 SECRET PROCEEDINGS inent ; many os the members were desirous that the pres ident should be elected for seven years, and not to be eligible a second time; others proposed that he should not be absolutely ineligible, but that he should not be ca pable of being chosen a second time, until the expiration of a certain number of years \u2014 The supporters of the above propositions, went upon the idea that the best security for liberty was a limited duration and a rotation of office in the chief executive department. There was a party who attempted to have the president appointed during good behaviour, without any limitation as to time, and not being able to succeed in that attempt, they then endeavoured to have him re-eligible without any restraint. It was objected that the choice of a presi dent to continue in office during good behaviour, would be at once rendering our system an elective monarchy ; and, that if the president was to be re-eligible without any interval of disqualification, it would amount nearly to the same thing, since with the powers that the presi dent is to enjoy, and the interests and influence with which they will be attended, he will be almost absolutely certain of being re-elecied from lime to time, as long as he lives : As the propositions were reported by the com mittee of the whole house, the president was to be chosen for seven years, and not to be eligible at any time after \u2014 In the same manner the proposition was agreed to in con vention, and so it was reported by the committee of detail, although a variety of attempts were made to alter that part of the system by those who were of a contrary opin ion, in which they repeatedly failed ; but, sir, by never losing sight of their object, and choosing a proper time for their purpose, they succeeded at length in obtaining the alteration, which was not made until within the last twelve days before the convention adjourned. As the propositions were agreed to by the committee of the -whole house, the president was to be appointed by"], [79, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 73 the national legislature, and as it was reported by tho committee of detail, the choice was to be made by ballot, in such a manner that the States should have an equal voice in the appointment of this officer, as they, of right, ought to have ; but those who wished as far as possible to establish a national instead of a federal government, made repeated attempts to have the president chosen by the people at large ; on this the sense of the convention was taken, I think not less than three times while I was there, and as often rejected ; but within the last fortnight of their session, they obtained the alteration in the man ner it now stands, by which the large States have a very undue influence in the appointment of the president. There is no case where the States will have an equal voice in the appointment of the president, except where two persons shall have an equal number of votes, and those a majority of the whole number of electors, a case very unlikely to happen, or where no person has a majority of the votes ; in these instances the house of representatives are to choose by ballot, each State having an equal voice ; but they are confined in the last instance to the five who have the great est number of votes, which gives the largest States a very unequal chance of having the president chosen under their nomination. As to the vice-president, that great officer of govern m ent, who is in case of death, resignation, removal, or in ability of the president, to supply his place, and be vest ed with his powers, and who is officially to be the presi dent of the senate, there is no provision by which a ma jority of the voices of the electors are necessary for his appointment, but after it is decided who is chosen presi dent, that person who has the next greatest number of votes of the electors, is declared to be legally elected to the vice-presidency, so that by this system it is very pos sible, and not improbable, that he may be appointed by the electors of a single large State ; and a very undue in- K"], [80, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 74 fluence in the senate is given to that State of which the vice-president is a citizen, since in every question where the senate is divided that State will have two votes, the president having on those occasions a casting voice. \u2014 Every part of the system which relates to the vice-presi dent, as well as the present mode of electing the presi dent, was introduced and agreed upon after I left Phila delphia. Objections were made to that part of this article, by which the president is appointed commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the mili tia of the several States, and it was wished to be so far restrained that he should not command in person ; but this could not be obtained. The power given to the pre sident of granting reprieves and pardons, was also thought extremely dangerous, and as such opposed \u2014 The presi dent thereby has the power of pardoning those who are guilty of treason, as well as of other offences; it was said that no treason was so likely to take place as that in which the president might himself be engaged \u2014 The at tempt to assume to himself powers not given by the consti tution, and establish himself in regal authority; in which attempt a provision is made for him to secure from punish ment the creatures of his ambition, the associates and abet tors of his treasonable practices, by granting them pardons should they be defeated in their attempts to subvert the constitution. To that part ef this article also which gives the pre sident a right to nominate, and with the consent of the senate to appoint all the officers, civil and military, of she United States, there were considerable opposition \u2014 it was said that the person who nominates, will always in reality appoint, and that this was giving the president a power and influence, which, together with the other powers bestowed upon him, would place him above all restrairit or control. In fine, it was urged, that the pre-"], [81, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 75 sident as here constituted, was a king, in every thing but the name; that though he was to be chosen for a limited time, yet at the expiration of that time, if he is not re-elected, it will depend entirely upon his own mode ration whether he will resign that authority with which he has once been invested \u2014 that from his having the ap pointment of all the variety of officers in every part of the civil department for the union, who will be very nu merous, in them and their connexions, relations, friends and dependents, he will have a formidable host devoted to his interest, and ready to support his ambitious views. That the army and navy, which may be increased with out restraint as to numbers, the officers of which, from the highest to the lowest, are all to be appointed by him, and dependent on his will and pleasure, and commanded by him in person*, will, of course, be subservient to his wishes, and ready to execute his commands ; in addi tion to which, the militia also are entirely subjected lo his orders \u2014 That these circumslances, combined together, will enable him, when he pleases, to become a king in name, as well as in substance, and establish himself in office not only for his own life, but even if he chooses, to have that authority perpetuated to his family. It was further observed, that the only appearance of responsibility in the president, which the system holds \u2022up to our view, is the provision for impeachment ; but that when we reflect that he cannot be impeached but by the house of delegates, and that the members of this house are rendered dependent upon,' and unduly under the influence of the president, by being appointable to offices of which he has the sole nomination, so that with out his favor and approbation, they cannot obtain them, there is little reason to believe, that a majority will ever concur in impeaching the president, let his conduct be ever so reprehensible, especially too, as the final event of that impeachment will depend upon a different body,"], [82, "76 SECRET PROCEEDINGS and the members of the house of delegates will be cer tain, should the decision be ultimately in favor of the president, to become thereby the objects of his displea sure, and to bar to themselves every avenue to the emol uments of government. Should he, contrary to probability, be impeached, he is afterwards to be tried and adjudged by the senate, and without the concurrence of two thirds of the members who shall be present, he cannot be convicted \u2014 This se- nate being constituted a privy council to the president it is probable many of its leading and influential members may have advised or concurred in the very measures for which he may be impeached ; the members of the senate also are by the system, placed as unduly under the influ- ence of, and dependent upon, the president, as the mem- bers of the other branch, since they also are appointable to offices, and cannot obtain them but through the favor of the president \u2014 There will be great, important and valuable offices under this government, should it take place, more than sufficient to enable him to hold out the expectation of one of them to each of the senators \u2014 Un- der these circumstances, will any person conceive it to be difficult for the president always to secure to himself more than one third of that body ? Or, can it reasona- bly be believed, that a criminal will be convicted, who is constitutionally empowered to bribe his judges, at the head of whom is to preside on those occasions the chief justice, which officer in his original appointment, must be nominated by the president, and will therefore, pro- bably, be appointed not so much for his eminence in le- gal knowledge, and for his integrity, as from favoritism and influence, since the president knowing that in case of impeachment the chief justice is to preside at his trial, will naturally wish to sill that office with a person of whose voice and influence he shall consider himself se- cure. These are reasons to induce a belies, that there"], [83, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 77 will be but little probability of the president ever being either impeached or convicted ; but it was also urged, that vested with the powers which the system gives him, and with the influence attendant upon those powers, to him it would be of little consequence whether he was im peached or convicted, since he will be able to set both at defiance. These considerations occasioned a part of the convention to give a negative to this part of the system establishing the executive as it is now offered for our acceptance. By the third article, the judicial power of the United States is vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish. These courts, and these only, will have a right to decide upon the laws of the United States, and all questions arising upon their construction, and in a judicial manner to carry those laws into execution ; to which the courts both superior and inferior of the re spective States, and their judges and other magistrates, are rendered incompetent. To the courts of the geneial government are also confined all cases in law or equity, arising under the proposed constitution, and treaties made under the authority of the United States \u2014 all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and con suls \u2014 all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction \u2014 all controversies to which the United States are a party . \u2014 all controversies between two or more States \u2014 between a State and citizens of another State \u2014 between citizens of the same State, claiming lands under grants of different States, and between a State, or the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens or subjects. Whether, therefore, any laws or regulations of the congress, or any acts of its president!, or other officers, are contrary to, or not warranted by the constitution, rests only with the judges who are ap pointed by congress to determine ; by whose determinations every State must be bound. Should any question arise be-"], [84, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 78 tween a foreign consul and any of the citizens of the Unit* ed States, however remote from the seat of empire, it is to be heard before the judiciary of the general government, and in the first instance to be heard in the supreme court, however inconvenient to the parties, and however trifling the subject of dispute. Should the mariners of an Ameriean or foreign vessel, while in any American port, have occasion to sue for their wages, or in any other instance a controversy be longing to the admiralty jurisdiction should take place between them and their masters or owners, it is in the courts of the general government the suit must be insti tuted ; and either party may carry it by appeal to its su preme court: the injury to commerce, and the oppres sion to individuals which may thence arise, need not be enlarged upon. Should a citizen of Virginia, Pennsyl vania, or any other of the United States, be indebted to, or have debts due from, a citizen of this State, or any Other claim be subsisting on one side or the other, in consequence of commercial or other transactions, it is only in the courts of congress that either can apply for redress. The case is the same should any claim subsist between citi zens of this State and foreigners, merchants, mariners, and others, whether of a commercial or of any other nature, they must be prosecuted in the same courts ; and though, in the first instance, they may be brought in the inferior, yet an appeal may be made to the supreme judiciary, even from the remotest State in the union. The inquiry concerning, and trial of every offence against, and breach of the laws of congress, are also con fined to its courts; the same courts also have the sole right to inquire concerning and try every offence, from the lowest to the highest, commilted by the citizens of any other State, or of a foreign nation, against the laws of this State within its territory \u2014 and in all these cases the decision may be ultimately brought before the supreme"], [85, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 79 tribunal, since the appellate jurisdiction extends to criminal as well as to civil cases. And in all those cases where the general government has jurisdiction in civil questions, the proposed constitu tion not only makes no provision for the trial by jury in the first instance, but by its appellate jurisdiction absolutely takes aicay that inestimable privilege, since it expressly declares the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdic tion both as to law and fact. Should therefore a jury be adopted in the inferior court, it would only be a needless expense, since on an appeal the determination of that jury, even on questions ofifact, however honest and upright, ia to be of no possible effect \u2014 the supreme court is to take up all questions of fact \u2014 to examine the evidence relative there to \u2014 to decide upon them in the same manner as if they had never been tried by a jury \u2014 nor is trial by jury secured in criminal cases. It is true, that in the first instance, in the inferior court, the trial is to be by jury ; in this and in this* only, is the difference between criminal and civil cases. But, sir, the appellate jurisdiction extends, as I have observ ed, to cases criminal as well as to civil, and on the appeal the court is to decide not only on the law but on the fact. If, therefore, even in criminal cases, the general government is not satisfied with the verdict of the jury, its officer may remove the prosecution to the supreme court, and there the verdict of the jury is to be of no effect, but the judges of this court are to decide upon the fact as well as the law, the same as in civil cases. Thus, sir, jury trials, which have ever been the boast of the English constitution, which have been by our several State constitutions so cautiously secured to us \u2014 jury trials; which have so long been considered the surest barrier against arbitrary power, and the palladium of liberty/ \u2014 wish the loss of which the loss of our freedom may be dated, are taken away by the proposed form of govern ment, not only in a great variety of questions between \u00bb'\u00ab\u00bb"], [86, "80 SECRET PROCEEDINGS dividual and individual, but in every case whether civil or criminal arising under the laws of the United States, or the execution of those laws. It is taken away in those very cases where of all others it is most essential for our li berty, to have it sacredly guarded and preserved, in every case, whether civil or criminal, between government and its officers on the one part, and the subject or citizen on the other. Nor was this the effect of inattention, nor did it arise from any real difficulty in establishing and secur ing jury trials by the proposed constitution, if the con vention had wished so to do : but the same reason influ enced here as in the case of the establishment of inferior courts ; as they could not trust State judges, so would they not confide in State juries. They alleged that the gener al government and the State governments would always be at variance ; that the citizens of the different States would enter into the views and interests of their respec tive States, and therefore ought not to be trusted in deter mining causes in which the general government was any way interested, without giving the general government an opportunity, if it disapproved the verdict of the jury, to appeal, and to have the facts examined into again and de cided upon by its own judges, on whom it was thought a re liance might be had by the general government, they be ing appointed under its authority. Thus, sir, in consequence of this appellate jurisdiction and its extension to facts as well as to law, every arbitra ry act of the general government, and every oppression of all those variety of officers appointed under its autho rity for the collection of taxes, duties, impost, excise, and other purposes, must be submitted to by the individual, or must be opposed with little prospect of success, and al most a certain prospect of ruin, at least in those cases where the middle and common class of citizens are inter ested: Since to avoid that oppression, or to obtain re dress, the application must be made to one of the courts"], [87, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 81 os the United Stales \u2014 by good fortune should this appli cation be in the first instance attended with success, and should damages be recovered equivalent to the injury sustained, an appeal lies to the supreme court, in which case the citizen must at mice give up his cause, or he must atiend to it at the distance of perhaps more than a thousand miles from the place of his residence, and must take measures to procure before that court on the ap peal all the evidence necessary to support his action, which even if ultimately prosperous, must be attended with a loss of time, a neglect of business, and an expense which will be greater than the original grievance, and to which men in moderate circumstances would be utterly unequal. By the third section of this article, it is declared, that treason against the United States shall consist in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid or comfort.

L"], [88, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 82 To save the citizens of the respective States from this disagreeable dilemma, and to secure them from being punishable as traitors to the United States, when acting expressly in obedience to the authority of their own State, I wished to have obtained as an amendment to the third section of this article the following clause: \"Provided, that no act or acts done by one or more of the States against the United States, or by any citizen of any one of the United States, under the authority of one or more of the said States, shall be deemed treason, or punished as such; but in case of war being levied by one or more of the States against the United States, the conduct of each party towards the other, and their adherents respective ly, shall be regulated by the laws of war and of na tions.\" But this provision \"was not adopted, being too much opposed to the great object of many of the leading mem bers of the convention, which was by all means to leave the States at the mercy of the general government, since they could not succeed in their immediate and entire abo lition. By the third section of the fourth article, no new State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State, without the consent of the legislature of such State. There are a number of States which are so circumstan ced, with respect to themselves and to the other States, that every principle of justice and sound policy requires their dismemberment or division into smaller States. \u2014 Massachusetts is divided into two districts, totally sepa rated from each other by the State of New Hampshire, on the north-east side of which lies the provinces of Maine and Sagadohock, more extensive in point of territory, but less populous than old Massachusetts, which lies on the other side of New Hampshire. No person can cast his eye on the map of that State but he must in a mo-"], [89, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 83 rnent admit, that every argument drawn from conve nience, interest, and justice, require that the provinces of Maine and Sagadohock should be erected into a new State, and that they should not be compelled to remain connect ed with old Massachusetts under all the inconveniences of their situation. The State of Georgia is larger in extent than the whole island of Great Britain, extending from its sea coast to the Mississippi, a distance of eight hundred miles or more ; its breadth for the most part, about three hun dred miles. The States of North Carolina, and Virginia in the same manner reach from the sea coast unto the ... ... Mississippi. The hardship, the inconvenience, and the injustice of compelling the inhabitants of those States who may dwell on the western side of the mountains and along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to remain connected with the inhabitants of those States respectively, on the Atlantic side of the mountains, and subject to the same State gov ernments, would be such as would, in my opinion, justify even recourse to arms, to free themselves from, and to shake off, so ignominious a yoke. This representation was made in convention, and it was further urged, that the territory of these States were too large, and that the inhabitants thereof would be too much disconnected for a republican government to extend to them its benefits, which is only suited to a small and compact territory: That a regard also for ihe peace and safety of the union, ought to excite a desire that those States should become in time divided into separate States, since, when their population should become proportioned in any degree to their territory, they would from their strength arid power beeome dangerous members of a fede ral government. It was further said that if the general government was not by its constitution to interfere, the inconvenience would soon remedy itself, for that as the"], [90, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 84 population increased in those States, their legislatures would be obliged to consent to the erection of new States to avoid the evils of a civil war; hut as by the pioposed constitution the general government is obliged to protect each Stale against domestic violence, and consequently will be obliged to assist in suppressing such commotions and insurrections as may take place from the struggle to have new States erected, the general government ought to have a power to decide upon the propriety and necessi ty of establishing or erecting a new Slate, even without the approbation of the legislature of such States, within whose jurisdiction, the new State should be erected, and for this purpose I submitted to the convention the follow ing proposition : \" That on the application of the inha bitants of any district of territory within the limits of any of the States, it shall be lawful for the legislature of the United States, if they shall under all circumstances think it reasonable to erect the same into a new State, and admit it into the union without the consent of the State of which the said district may be a part.\" And it was said, that we surely might trust the general govern ment with this power with more propriety than with many others with which they were proposed to be entrusted \u2014 and that as the general government was bound to sup press all insurrections and commotions which might arise on this subject, it ought to be in the power of the gener al government to decide upon it, and not in the power of the legislature of a single State, by obstinately and un reasonably opposing the erection of anew State to prevent its taking effect, and thereby extremely to oppress that part of its citizens which live remote from, and inconvenient to, the seat of its government, and even to involve the un ion in war to support its injustice and oppression. But, upon the vote being taken, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachu setts, were in the negative. New Hampshire, Connect!-"], [91, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION 85 cut, Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, were in the affirm ative. New York was absent. That it was inconsistent with the rights of free and in dependent States, to have their territory dismembered wiihout their consent, was the principal argument used by the opponents of this proposition. The truth of the objection we readily admitted, but at the same time in sisted that it was not more inconsistent with the rights of free and independent States than that inequality of suf frage and power which the large States had extorted from the others ; and that if the smaller States yielded up their rights in that instance, they were entitled to demand from the States of extensive territory a surrender of their rights in this instance ; and in a particular manner, as it was equally necessary for the true interests and happiness of the citizens of their own States, as of the union. But, sir, although when the large States demanded undue and im proper sacrifices to be made to their pride and ambition, they treated the rights of free States with more contempt than ever a British parliament treated the rights of her colonial establishments, yet when a reasonable and neces sary sacrifice was asked from them they spurned the idea with ineffable disdain. They then perfectly understood the full value and the sacred obligation of State rights, and at the least attempt to infringe them where they were concerned, they were tremblingly alive and agonized at every pore. When we reflect how obstinately those States contended for that unjust superiority of power in the government, which they have in part obtained, and for the establish ment of this superiority by the constitution \u2014 When we re flect that they appeared willing to hazard the existence of the union rather than not to succeed in their unjust attempt \u2014 That should their legislatures consent to the erection of new States within their jurisdiction, it would be an immediate sacrifice of that power, to obtain which"], [92, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 86 they appeared disposed to sacrifice every other considera- tion\u2014 When we further reflect that they note have a motive 1'or desiring to preserve their territory entire and uubro- ken, which they never had before \u2014 the gratification of their ambition in possessing and exercising superior power over their sister States \u2014 and that this constitution is to give them the means to effect this desire of which they were formerly destitute\u2014 the whole force of the United States pledged to them for restraining intestine commotions, and preserving to them the obedience and subjection of their citizens, even in the extremest part of their territory ; \u2014 I say, sir, when we consider these things, it would be too absurd and im probable to deserve a serious answer, should any person suggest that these States mean ever to give their consent to the erection of new States within their territory : Some of them it is Irue, have been for some time past amusing their inhabitants in those districts that wished to be erected into new States, but should this constitution be adopted, arm ed with a sword and halter to compel their obedience and subjection, they will no longer act with indecision ; and the State of Maryland may, and probably will be called upon to assist with her wealth and her blood in subduing the inhabitants of Franklin, Kentucky, Vermont, and the provinces of Maine, and Sagadohock, and in compelling them to continue in subjection to the States which respec tively claim jurisdiction over them. Let it not be forgotten at the same time, that a great part of the territory of these large and extensive States, which they now hold in possession, and over which they now claim and exercise jurisdiction, were crown lands, unlocated and unsettled when the American revolution took place \u2014 Lands which were acquired by the common blood and treasnre, and which ought to have been the com mon slock, and for the common benefit of the union.

But, sir, the question is not now whether those States shall hold that territory unjustly to them selves, but whether by that act of injustice they shall have superiority of power and influence over the other States, and have a constitutional right to domineer and lord it over them \u2014 Nay*i more, whether we will agree to a. form of go vernment by which we pledge lo those Slates the whole force of the union to preserve to them their extensive terri tory entire and unbroken and with our blood and wealth to assist them, whenever they please to demand it, to preserve the inhabitants thereof under their subjection, for the pur pose of increasing their superiority over us \u2014 of gratifying their unjust ambition \u2014 in a word, for the purpose of giving ourselves masters, and of riveting our chains ! The part of the system, which provides that so religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States, was adopted by a great majority of the convention, and without much debate \u2014 however, there were some members so unfashionable as to think that a belief of the existence of a Deity, and of a slate of future rewards and punishments would be some se curity for the good conduct of our rulers, and that in a chris tian country it would be at least decent to hold out some distinction between the professors of Christianity and down right infidelity or paganism. The seventh article declares, that the ratification of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this con stitution between the States ratifying the same. It was attempted to obtain a resolve, that if seven States,"], [94, "88 SECRET PROCEEDINGS whose votes in the first branch should amount to a ma jority of the representation in that branch, concurred in the adoption of the system, it should be sufficient, and this attempt was supported on the principle, that a ma jority ought to govern the minority ; \u2014 but to this it was objected, that although it was true, after a constitution and form of government is agreed on, in every act done under and consistent with that constitution and form of government, the act of the majority, unless otherwise agreed in the constitution, should bind the minority, yet it was directly the reverse in originally forming a consti tution, or dissolving it \u2014 That in originally forming a constitution, it was necessary that every individual should agree to it to become bound thereby \u2014 and that when once adopted, it could not be dissolved by consent, unless with the consent of every individual who was party to the original agreement \u2014 That in forming our original federal government, every member of that government, that is, each State, expressly consented to it ; that it is a part of the compact made and entered into in the most solemn manner, that there should be no dissolution or al teration of that federal government without the consent of every State, the members of, and parties to, the original compact ; that therefore no alteration could be made by a consent of a part of these States, or by the consent of the inhabitants of a part of the Slates, which could either re lease the States so consenting, from the obligation they are under to the other States, or which could in any man ner become obligatory upon those States that should not ratify such alterations.

In this opin ion all your delegates who were attending were unani mous. I, sir, opposed it also upon a more extensive ground, as being directly contrary to the mode of alter ing our federal government established in our original compact; and as such being a direct violation of the mu tual faith plighted by the States to each other, I gave it my legative. 1 also was of opinion, that the States, considered as states, in their political capacity, are the members of a federal government ; that the Stales in their political ca- pacity, or as sovereignties, are entitled, and only entitled, originally to agree upon the form of, and submit them- selves to, a federal government, and afterwards by mu- tual consent to dissolve or alter it \u2014 That every thing which nl ites to the formation, the dissolution, or the al- teration of a federal government over slates equally fiee, sovereign, and independent, is the peculiar province of the States in their sovereign or political capacity, in the same manner as what relates to forming alliances or treaties of peace, amity, or commerce, and that the people at large, .in their individual capacity, have no more right to in- terfere in (he one case than in the other. That accoid- ing to these principles we originally acted in forming our confederation ; it was the Slates as States, by their representatives in congress, that formed the articles of confederation ; it was the States, as States, by their legis- latures, who ratified those articles, and it was there estab- lished and provided, that the States, as States, that is by their legislatures, should agree to any alterations that should hereufter he proposed in the federal government, before they should be binding \u2014 and any alterations \u2022gieed to in any other manner cannot telease the Statei"], [97, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 91 from the obligttion they are under to each other by vir tue of the original articles of con (\"deration.

It was also my opinion, that upon principles of sound policy, ihe agree ment or disagreement to ihe proposed system ought to have been by ihe Slate legislatures, in which case, let the event have been what it would, there would have been but little prospect of the public peace being disturbed thereby \u2014 Whereas the attempt to force down this sys tem, although congress and the respective State legisla tures should disapprove, by appealing to the people, and to procure its establishment in a manner totally uncon stitutional, has a tendency to set the State governments and their subjects at variance with each othe,* \u2014 to lessee"], [98, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 92 the obligations of government \u2014 to weaken the bands of so ciety \u2014 to introduce anarchy and confusion \u2014 and lo light the torch of discord and civil war throughout this conti nent.

I have now, sir, in discharge of the duty I owe to this house, given stich information as hath occurred to me, which I consider most material for them to know ; and you will easily perceivo from this detail that a great por tion of that time, which ought to have been devoted calm ly and impartially lo consider w'lat al erations in our fe deral government would be most likely to procure and preserve the happiness of the union, was employed in a violent struggle on ihe one side to obtain all power and dominion in their own hands, and on ihe o.her to prevent it ; and that the aggrandizement ot' particular S.alus and parlicular individuals appears to have been much more the object sought after, lit in ihe welfare of our country.

Myself or my State will never submit to tyranny or despotism. Upon the whole, every sovereign State, according to a confederation, must have an equal vote, or there is an end to liberty. As long, therefore, as State distinctions are held up, this rule must invariably apply ; and if a consolidated national government must take place, then Slate distinctions must cease, or the States must be equal ized. Mr. Wilson was in favor of the resolve. He observed that a majority, nay, even a minority of the States, have a right to confederate with each other, and the rest may do as they please. He considered numbers as the best criterion to determine representation. Every citizen of one State possesses the same rights with the citizen of another. Let us see how tnis rule will apply- to the pre sent question. Pennsylvania, from its numbers, has a right to 12 votes, when on the same principle New Jer sey is entitled to 5 votes. Shall New Jersey have the same right or influence in the councils of the nation with Pennsylvania? I say no. It is unjust \u2014 I never will confe derate on this plan. The gentleman from New Jersey is candid in declaring his opinion \u2014 I commend him for it \u2014 I am equally so. I say again, I never will confede rate 8n his principles. If no State will part with any of its sovereignty, it is in vain to talk of a national government. The State who has five times the number of inhabitants ought, nay must have the same proportion of weight in the representation. If there was a probability of equalising P"], [120, "114 SECRET PROCEEDINGS tho States, he would be for it. But we have no such power. If, however, we depart from the principles of re presentation in proportion to numbers, we will lose the ob ject of our meeting. The question postponed for farther consideration. Adjourned to to-morrow morning. MONDAY, JUNE 11th, 1787, Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Mr. Sherman moved that the first branch of the national legislature be chosen in proportion to the number of the whole inhabitants in each State. He observed that as the people ought to have the election of one of the branches of the legislature, ihe legislature of each Stale ought to have the election of ihe second branch, in order to preserve the Stale sovereignty; and that each State ought in this branch to have one vote. Governor Rulledge moved, as an amendment of the first proposition, that the proportion of representation ought to be according to, and in proportion to the contribution of tach State. Mr. Butler supported the motion, by observing that money is strength, and every State ought to have its weight in the national council in proportion to the quantity it possesses. He further observed, that when a boy he read this as one of the remarks of Julius C^sar, who declared if he had but money he would find soldiers, and every thing necessary to carry on a war. Mr- King observed, that it would be better first to estab lish a principle (that is to say) whether we will depart from federal grounds in forming a national government ; and therefore, to bring this point to view, he moved, as a pre vious question, that the sense of the committee be taken os the following question : That the right of suffrage in the first branch of the na tional legislature, ought not to be according to the rule in"], [121, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 118 the articles of confederation, but according to some equita* ble ratio of representation. Gov. Franklin's written remarks on this point were read by Mr. Wilson. In these Gov. Franklin observes, that representation ought to be in proportion to the im portance of numbers or wealth in each State \u2014 that there can be no danger of undue influence of the greater against the lesser States. This was the apprehension of Scot land when the union with England was proposed, when in parliament they were allowed only 16 peers and 45 com mons ; yet experience has proved that their liberties and influence were in no danger. The question on Mr. King's motion was carried in the affirmative \u2014 7 ayes \u2014 3 noes, and Maryland divided. New York, New Jersey, and Delaware in the negative. Mr. Dickinson moved as an amendment, to add tho words, according to the taxes and contributions of each State actually collected and paid into the national treasury. Mr. Butler was of opinion that the national government will only have the right of making and collecting the tax es, but that the States individually must lay their own taxes. Mr. Wilson was of opinion, and therefore moved, that the mode of representation of each of the States ought to be from the number of its free inhabitants, and of every other description three fifths to one free inhabitant. He supposed that the impost will not be the only revenue \u2014 the post office he supposes would be another substantial source of revenue. He observed further, that this mode had already received the approbation of eleven States in their acquiescence to the quota made by congress. He admitted that this resolve would require further restrictions, for where numbers deter mined the representation a census at different periods of 5\u00bb 7 or 10 years, ought to be taken.

Mr. Madison was of opinion at present, to fix the stand ard of representation, and let the detail be the business of a sub-committee. Mr. Rutledge's motion was postponed. Mr. Wilson's motion was then put, and carried by 9 States against 2. New York in the majority. Mr. Wilson ihen moved, as an amendment to Mr. Sher man's motion, That the same proportion be observed in the election of the second branch as the first. The question however was first put on Mr. Sherman's motion, and lost \u2014 6 States against, aud 5 for it. Then Mr. Wilson's motion was put and carried \u2014 6 ayes, 5 noes. The eleventh resolve was then taken into consideration. Mr. Madison moved to add after the word junctions, the words, or separation. Mr. Read against the resolve in toto. We must put away State governments, and we will then remove all cause of jealousy. The guarantee will confirm the assumed rights of several States to lands which do belong to the confederation. Mr. Madison moved an amendment, to *dd to or alter the resolution as follows : The republican constitutions and the existing laws of each State, to be guaranteed by the United States. Mr. Randolph was for the present amendment, because a republican government must be the basis of our nation al union ; and no State in it ought to have it in their power to change its government into a monarchy.

If the State judges are not sworn to the observance of the new government, will they not judicially determine in favor of their State laws ? We are erecting a supreme national go vernment; ought it not to be supported, and can we give it too many sinews? Mr. Gerry rather supposes that the national legislators ought to be sworn to preserve the State constitutions, as they will run the greatest risk to be annihilated \u2014 and there fore moved it.

No debate arose on it, and the question was put and carried \u2014 5 States for it, 3 against, and 2 divided. New York in the negative. Having thus gone through with the resolves, it was found necessary to take up such parts of the preceding resolves as' had been postponed, or not agreed to. The remaining part of the 4th resolve was taken into consideration. Mr. Sherman moved that the blank of the duration of the first branch of the national legislature, be filled with one year. Mr. Rutledge with two years, and Mr. Jenifer with three years. Mr. Madison was for the last amendment \u2014 observing that it will give it stability, and induce gentlemen of the first weight to engage in it."], [124, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 118 Mr. Gerry is afraid the people will bo alarmed, as savor ing of despotism. Mr. Madison. The people's opinions cannot be known, as to the particular modifications which may be necessa ry in the new government \u2014 In general, they believe there is something wrong in the present system lhat requires amendment; and he could wish to make the republican system the basis of the change \u2014 because if our amend ments should fail of securing their happiness, they will despair it can be done in this way, and incline to mo narchy.

Randolph observed the difficulty in establishing the powers of the judiciary \u2014 the object however at pre sent is to establish this principle, to wit, the security of"], [126, "120 SECRET PROCEEDINGS foreigners where treaties are in their favor, and to pre- serve the harmony of States and that of the citizens theie- of. This being once established, it will be the business of a sub-committee to detail it ; and therefore moved to obliterate such parts of the resolve so as only to establish the principle, to wit, that the jurisdiction of the national judiciary shall extend to all cases of national revenue, im peachment of national officers, and questions which involve the national peace or harmony. Agreed to unanimously. It was further agreed, that the judiciary be paid out of the national treasury. Mr. Pinkney moved that the judiciary be appointed by the national legislature. Mr. Madison is of opinion that the second branch of the legislature ought to appoint the judiciary, which the con vention agreed to. Mr. Gerry moved that the first branch shall have the on ly right of originating bills to supply the treasury. Mr. Butler against the motion. We are constantly running away with the idea of the excellence of the Brit ish parliament, and with or without reason copying from them ; when in fact there is no similitude in our situations. With us both houses are appointed by the people, and both ought to be equally trusted. Mr. Gerry. If we dislike the British government for the oppressive measures by them carried on against us, yet he hoped we would not be so far prejudiced as to make ours in every thing opposite to theirs. Mr. Madison's question carried. The committee having now gone through the whole of the propositions from Virginia \u2014 Resolved, That the com mittee do report to the convention their proceedings \u2014 This was accordingly done. [See a copy of it hereunto an nexed.] The house resolved on the report being 'read, that th\u00ab"], [127, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 121 consideration thereof be postponed to to-morrow, and lhat members have leave to take copies thereof. Adjourned to to-morrow morning. THURSDAY, JUNE 14th, 1787 Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Mr. Patterson moved that the further consideration of the report be postponed until to-morrow, as he inteded to give in principles to form a federal system of government materially different from the system now under considera tion. Postponement agreed to. Adjourned until to-morrow morning, FRIDAY, JUNE 15th, 1787 Met pursuant^to adjournment. Present 11 States. Mr. Patterson, pursuant to his intentions as mentioned yesterday, read a set of resolves as the basis of amendment to the confederation. [See those resolves annexed,] He observed that no government could be energetic on paper only, which was no more than straw \u2014 that the remark applied to the one as well as to the other system, and is therefore of opinion that there must be a small standing force to give every government weight. Mr: Madison moved for the report of the committee, and the question may then come on whether the conven tion will postpone it in order to take into consideration the system now offered. Mr. Lansing is of opinion that the two systems are fairly contrasted. The one now offered is on the basis of amend ing the federal government, and the other to be reported as a national government, on propositions which exclude the propriety of amendment. Considering therefore its importance, and that justice may be done to its weighty consideration, he is for postponing it a day. Col. Hamilton cannot say he is in sentiment with ei ther plan \u2014 supposes both might again be considered as Q"], [128, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 122 federal plans, and by this means they will be fairly in committee, and be contrasted so as to make a compara tive estimate of the two. Thereupon it was agreed, that the report be postponed, and that the house will resolve iiself into a committee of the whole, to take into consideration both propositions to morrow. Then the convention adjourned to to-morrow morning. SATURDAY, JUNE lGth, 1787. Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Mr. Lansing moved lo have (he first arlicle of ihe last plan of government read ; which being done, he observ- ed, lhat this system is faiily contrasted with the one tea *dy to be reported \u2014 the one federal, and the other nation- al In the first, the powers are exercised as flowing from the respective State governments \u2014 The second, deriving its authority from the people of the respective States \u2014 which latter must ultimately destroy or annihilate the State governments. To determine the powers on these grand objects with which we are invested, let us recur to the credentials of the respective Stales, and see* what the views were of. those who sent us. The language is there expressive \u2014 it is upon the revision of the present confed eration, to alter and amend such parts as may appear defective, so as to give additional strength to (he union. And he would venture to assert, lhat had the legislature of (he State of New York, apprehended that their powers would have been construed to extend lo the formation of a national government, to the extinguishment of their in dependency, no delegates would have here appeared on the part of that State This sentiment must have had its weight on a former occasion, wen in this house; for when the second resolution of Virginia, which declared, in substance, that a federal government could not be Amended for the good of tho whole, the remark of an ho-"], [129, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 123 norabla member os South Carolina, lhat by determining this question in the affirmative their deliberative powers were at an end, induced this house to waive the resolution. It is in vain to adopt a mode of government which we have reason to believe the people gave us no power to re commend \u2014 as they will consider themselves on this ground authorized to reject it. See the danger of exceeding your powers by the example which the requisition of congress of 1783 afforded. They required an impost on all impor ted articles, to which, on federal grounds, they had no right unless voluntarily grunted. What was the consequence? Some, who had least to give, granted it ; and others, under various restriclions and modification*,- so lhat it could not be systematized. If we form a government, let us do it on principles which arc likely to meet ihe approbation of the States. Great changes can only be gradually intro duced. The States will never sacrifice their essential rights to a national government. New plans, annihilating the rights of ihe States (unless upon evident necessity) can ne ver be approved. I may venture to assert, that the preva lent opinion of America is, that granting additional powers to congress would answer their views ; and every power re commended for their approbation exceeding this idea, will be fruitless. Mr. Patterson. \u2014 As I had the honor of proposing a new system of government for the union, it will be expected that I should explain its principles. 1st. The plan accords with our own powers. 2d. It accords with the sentiments of the people. But if the subsisting confederation is so radically defec tive as not lo admit of amendment, let us say so and report its insufficiency, and wait for enlarged powers. We must, in the present case, pursue our powers, if we expect the approbation of the people. * I am not here to pursue my own sentiments of government, but of those who have seat me; and I believe that a little practical virtue"], [130, "124 SECRET PROCEEDINGS is to be preferred lo the finest theoretical principles, which cannot be carried into effect. Can we, as repre sentatives of independent States, annihilate the essential powers of independency? Are not the votes of this con vention taken on every question under the idea of inde pendency ? Let us turn to the 5th article of confedera tion \u2014 in this it is mutually agreed, that each State should have one vote \u2014 It is a fundamental principle arising from confederated governments. The 13th article provides for amendments ; but they must be agreed to by every Stale \u2014 the dissent of one renders every proposal null. The confederation is in the nature of a compact ; and can any State, unless by the consent of the whole, either in politics or law, withdraw their powers ? Let it be said by Pennsylvania, and the other large States, that they, for the sake of peace, assented to the confederation ; can she now resume her original right without the consent of the donee . And although it is now asserted that the larger States reluctantly agreed to that part of the confederation which secures an equal suffrage to each, yet let it be remember ed, that the smaller States were the last who approved the confederation. On this ground representation must be drawn from the States to maintain their independency, and not from the people composing those States. The doctrine advanced by a learned gentleman from Pennsylvania, that all power is derived from the people, and that in proportion to their numbers they ought to parti cipate equally in the benefits and rights of government, is right in principle, but unfortunately for him, wrong in the application to the question now in debate. When independent societies confederate for mutual defence, they do so in their collective capacity ; and then each State, for those purposes, must be considered as one of the contracting parties. Destroy this balance of equa-"], [131, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 125 lity, and you endanger the rights of the lesser societies by the danger of usurpation in the greater. Let us test the government intended to be made by the Virginia plan on these principles. The representatives in the national legislature are to be in . proportion to the number of inhabitants in each State. So far it is right, upon the principles of equality, when State distinctions are done away; but those to certain purposes still exist. Will the government of Pennsylvania admit a participa tion of their common stock of land to the citizens of New Jersey? I fancy not. It therefore follows, that a national government upon the present plan, is unjust, and de structive of the common principles of reciprocity. Much has been said that this government is to operate on per sons, not on States. This, upon examination, will be found equally fallacious ; for the fact is, it will, in the quotas of revenue, be proportioned among the States, as States ; and in this business Georgia will have one vote, and Virginia sixteen. The truth is, both plans may be considered to compel individuals to a compliance with their requisitions, although the requisition is made on the States. Much has been said in commendation of two branches in a legislature, and of the advantages resulting from their being checks to each other. This may be true when ap plied to State governments, but will not equally apply to a national legislature, whose legislative objects are few and simple. Whatever may be said of congress, or their conduct on particular occasions, the people in general are pleased with such a body, and in general wish an increase of their pow ers for the good government of the union. Let us now see the plan of the national government on the score of expense. The least the second branch of the legislature can consist of is 90 members \u2014 The first branch of at least 270. How are they to be paid in our present impoverished situation?"], [132, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 126 Let us, therefore, fairly try whether the confederation can not be mended, and if il can, we shall do our duty, and I believe the people will be satisfied. Mr. Wilson first stated the difference between the two plans. Virginia plan proposes two branches in the legislature. Jersey a single legislative body. Virginia, the legislative powers derived from the people. Jersey, from the States. Virginia, a single executive. Jersey, more than one. Virginia, a majority of the legislature can act. Jersey, a small minority can control. Virginia, the legislature can legislate on all national con- cerns. Jersey, only on limited objects. Virginia, legislature to negative all State laws. Jersey, giving power to the executive to compel obedience by force. Virginia, lo remove the executive by impeachment. Jersey, on application of a m-ijority of the States. Virginia, for the establishment of infeiior judiciary tribu- nals. Jersey, no provision. It is said and insisted on, that the Jersey plan accords with our powers. As for himself, he considers his pow ers to extend to every thing or nothing; and therefore that, he has a right, and 'n at liberty to agree to either plan or none. 7\"he people expect relief from their pre sent embarrassed situation, and look up' fur it to this na tional convention ; and it follows that they expect a na tional government, and therefore the plan from Virginia has the preference to the other. I would (says he) wilh a reluctant hand add any powers to congress, because they are not a body chosen by the people, and consist only of one branch, and each State in it has one vote. Ine-"], [133, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 127 quality in representation poisons every government. The English courts are hitherto pure, just and incorrupt, while their legislature are base and venal. The one ari ses from unjust representation, the other from their in dependency of the legislature. Lord Chesterfield re mit ks that one of the stales of the United Netherlands withheld ils assenl to a proposition until a major of their state was provided for. He needed not to have added (for the conclusion was self evident) that it was one of the lesser states. I mean no reflection, but I leave it to gentlemen lo consider whether ibis has not also been the case in congress ? The argument in favor of the Jer sey plan goes too far, as it cannot be completed, unless Rhode Island assents. A single legislature is very dan gerous \u2014 Despotism may present itself in various shapes. May there not be legislative despotism if in the exer cise of their power ihey are unchecked or unrestrained by another branch? On the contrary an executive lo be restrained must be an individual. The first triumvirate of Rome combined, without law, was fatal to its liber ties ; and the second, by the usurpation of Augustus, ended in despotism. \u2014 The two kings of Sparta and the consuls of Rome, by sharing the executive, distracted their gov emmcnis. Mr. C. C. Pinkuey supposes that if New Jersey was indulged with one vote out of 13, she would have no ob jection lo a national government. He supposes that the convention have already determined, virtually, that ihe federal government cannot be made efficient. A nation al government being therefore the object, this plan must be pursued \u2014 as our business is not to conclude but to re commend. Judge Elsworth is of opinion lhat the first question on the new plan will decide nothing materially on principle, and therefore moved the postponement thereof, in order to bring on the second."], [134, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 128 Gov. Randolph. \u2014 The question now is which of the two plans is to be preferred. If the vote on the first resolve will determine it; and it is so generally understood, he has no objection that it be put. The resolutions from Virginia must have been adopted on the supposition that a federal government was impracticable \u2014 And it is said that power is wanting to institute such a government. \u2014 But when our all is at stake, I will consent to any mode that will preserve us. View our present deplorable situation \u2014 France, to whom we are indebted in every motive of gratitude and honor, is left unpaid the large sums she has supplied us with in the day of our necessity \u2014 Our officers and soldiers, who have successfully fought our battles \u2014 and the loaners of money to the public, look up to you for relies. The bravery of our troops is degraded by the weakness of our government. It has been contended that the 5th article of the con federation cannot be repealed under the powers to new modify the confederation by the 13th article. This sure ly is false reasoning, since the whole of the confedera tion upon revision is subject to amendment and altera tion ; besides our business consists in recommending a system of government, not to make it. There are great seasons when persons with limited powers are justified in exceeding them, and a person would be contemptible not to risk it. Originally our confederation was founded on the weakness of each State to repel a foreign enemy ; and we have found that the powers granted to congress are insufficient. The body of congress is ineffectual to car ry the great objects of safety and protection into execu tion. What would their powers be over the commander of the military, but for the virtue of the commander? As the State assemblies are constantly encroaching on the pow ers of congress, the Jersey plan would rather encourage such encroachments than be a check to it ; and from the"], [135, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 129 nature of the institution, congress would ever be govern ed by cabal and intrigue \u2014 They are besides too numer ous for an executive, nor can any additional powers be sufficient to enable them to protect us against foreign in vasion. Amongst other things congress was intended to be a body to preserve peace among the States, and in the rebellion of Massachusetts it was found they were not au thorized to use the troops of the confederation to quell it. Every one is impressed with the idea of a general regu lation of trade and commerce. Can congress do this? when from the nature of their institution they are sub ject to cabal and intrigue? And would it not be dan gerous to entrust such a body with the power, when they are dreaded on these grounds ? I am certain that a nation al government must be established, and this is the only moment when it can be done \u2014 And let me conclude by ob serving, that the best exercise of power is to exert it for the public good. Then adjourned to Monday morning MONDAY, JUNE l9th, 1787 Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Mr. Hamilton. \u2014 To deliver my sentiments on so impor tant a subject, when the first characters in the union have gone before me, inspires me with the greatest diffidence, es pecially when my own ideas are so materially dissimilar to the plans now before the committee \u2014 My situation is dis agreeable, but it would be criminal not to come forward on a question of such magnitude. I have well considered the subject, and am convinced that no amendment of the con federation can answer the purpose of a good government, so long as State sovereignties do, in any shape, exist ; and I have great doubts whether a national government on the Virginia plan can be made effectual. What is feder al ? An association of several independent States into one. How or in what manner this association is formed, is not R"], [136, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 130 so clearly distinguishable. We find the diet of Germany has in some instances the power of legislation on individu als. We find the United States of America have it in an extensive degree in the cases of piracies. Let us now review the powers with which we are in vested. We are appointed for the sole and express pur pose of revising the confederation, and to alter or amend it, so as to render it effectual for the purpose of a good government. Those who suppose it must be federal, lay great stress on the terms sole and express, as if these words intended a confinement to a federal government ; when the manifest import is no more lhan that the insti tution of a good government must be the sole and express object of your deliberations. Nor can we suppose an annihilation of our powers by forming a national gov ernment, as many of the States have made in their con stitutions no provision for any alteration ; and thus much I Can say for the State I have the honor to represent, that when our credentials were under consideration in the senate, some members were for inserting a restriction in the powers, to prevent an encroachment on the constitu tion : it was answered by others, and thereupon the re solve carried on the credentials, that it might abridge some of the constitutional powers of the State, and that possibly in the formation of a new union it would be found necessary. This appears reasonable, and there fore leaves us at liberty to form such a national govern ment as we think best adapted to the good of the whole. I have therefore no difficulty as to the extent of our pow ers, nor do I feel myself restrained in the exercise of my judgment under .them. We can only propose and re commend \u2014 the power of ratifying or rejecting is still in the States. But on this great question I am still greatly embarrassed. I have before observed my apprehension of the inefficacy of either plan, and I have great doubts whether a more energetic government can pervade this"], [137, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 131 wide and extensive country. I shall now show that both plans are materially defective. 1. A good government ought to be constant, and ought to contain an active principle. 2. Utility and necessity. 3. An habitual sense of obligation. 4. Force. 5. Influence. I hold it, that different societies havo all different views and interests to pursue, and always prefer local to general concerns. For example : New York legislature made an external compliance lately to a requisition of congress ; but do they not at the same time counteract their compliance by gratifying the local objects of the State so as to defeat their concession ? And this will ever be the case. Men always love power, and States will prefer their particular concerns to the general welfare; and as the States become large and important, will they not be less attentive to the general government? What in process of time will Virginia be ? She contains now half a million of inhabitants \u2014 in twenty-five years she will double the number. Feeling her own weight and importance, must she not become indifferent to the con cerns of the union ? And where, in such a situation, will be found national attachment to the general govern ment. By force, I mean the coercion of law and the coercion of arms. Will this remark apply to the power intended to be vested in the government to be instituted by their plan ? A delinquent must be compelled to obedience by force of arms. How is this to be done? If you are unsuc cessful, a dissolution of your government must bo the conse quence ; and in that case the individual legislatures will re assume their powers; nay, will not the interest of the States be thrown into the State governments?"], [138, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 132 By influence, I moan the regular weight and support it will receive from those who will find it their interest to support a government intended to preserve the peace and happiness of the community of the whole. The State governments, by either plan will exert the means to coun teract it. They have their State judges and militia, all combined to support their State interests; and these will be influenced to oppose a national government. Either plan is therefore precarious. The national government cannot long exist when opposed by such a weighty rival. The ex perience of ancient and modern confederacies evince this point, and throw considerable light on the subject. The amphyctionic council of Greece had a right lo require of its members troops, money, and the force of the country. Were they obeyed in the exercise of those powers? Could they preserve the peace of the greater States and repub lics? or where were they obeyed? History shows that their decrees were disregarded, aud that the stronger states, regardless of their power, gave law to the lesser. Let us examine the federal institution of Germany. Tt was instituted upon the laudable principle of securing the independency of the several states of which it was compos ed, and to protect them against foreign invasion. Has it answered these good intentions? Do we not see that their councils are weak and distracted, and that it cannot prevent the wars and confusion which the respective electors carry on against each other? The Swiss cantons, or the Helvetic union, are equally inefficient. Such are the lessons which the experience of others affords us, and from whence results the evident conclu sion that all federal governments are weak and distract ed. To avoid the evils deducible from these observa tions, we must establish a general and national govern vent, completely sovereign, and annihilate the State dis tinctions and State operations; and unless we do this, no"], [139, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 133 good purpose can bo answered. What does the Jersey plan propose ? It surely has not this for its object. By this we grant the regulation of trade and a more effectu al collection of the revenue, and some partial duties. These, at five or ten per cent, would only perhaps amount to a fund to discharge the debt of the corpora tion. Let us take a review of the variety of important objects which must necessarily engage the attention of a national government. \\rou have to protect your rights against Canada on tho north, Spain on the south, and your western frontier against the savages. You have to adopt necessary plans for the settlement of your frontiers, and to institute the mode in which settlements and good government are to be made. How is the expense of supporting and regulating these important matters to be defrayed ? By requisition on the States, according to tho Jersey plan ? Will this do it? We have already found it ineffectual. Let one Stats prove delinquent, and it will encourage others to follow the example ; and thus the whole will fail. And what is the standard to quota among the States their respective proportions? Can lands be the standard? How would that apply between Russia and Holland ? Compare Pennsylvania with North-Carolina, or Connecticut with New York. Does not commerce or industry in the one or other make a great disparity between these different countries, and may not the comparative value of ihe States from these circumstances, make an unequal dis proportion when the data is numbers? I therefore con clude that either system would ultimately destroy the confederation, or any other government which is estab lished on such fallacious principles. Perhaps imposts, tax es on specific articles, would produce a more equal system of drawing a revenue."], [140, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 134 Another objection against the Jersey plan is, ihe unequal representation. Can the great States consent to this? If they did it would eventually work its own destruction. How are forces to be raised by the Jersey plan ? By quo tas? Will the States comply with the requisition ? As much as they will with the taxes. Examine the present confederation, and it is evident they can raise no troops nor equip vessels before war is actually declared. They cannot therefore take any preparatory measure before an enemy is at your door. How unwise and inadequate their powers ! and this must ever be the case when you attempt to define powers. \u2014 Something will always be wanting. Congress, by being annually elected, and subject to recall, will ever come with the prejudices of their States rather than the good of the union. Add therefore additional powers to a body thus organized, and you establish a sovereignty of the worst kind, consisting of a single body. Where are the checks? None. They must either prevail over the State governments, or the prevalence of the State governments must endwin their dissolution. This is a conclusive objec tion to the Jersey plan. Such are the insuperable objections to both plans: and what is to be done on this occasion ? I confess I am at a loss. I foresee the difficulty on a consolidated plan of drawing a representation from so extensive a continent to one place. What can be the inducements for gentle men to come 600 miles to a national legislature ? The expense would at least amount to \u00a3100,000. This how ever can be no conclusive objection if it eventuates in an extinction of State governments. The burthen of the latter would be saved, and the expense then would not be great. State distinctions would be found unnecessa ry, and yet I confess, to carry government to the extre mities, the State governments reduced to corporations, and with very limited powers, might be necessary, and"], [141, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 135 the expense of the national government become less bur densome. Yet, I confess, I see great difficulty of drawing forth a good representation. What, for example, will bo the in ducements for gentlemen of fortune and abilities to leave their houses and business to attend annually and long? It cannot be the wages ; for these, I presume, must bo small. Will not the power, therefore, be thrown into the hands of the demagogue or middling politician, who, for the sake of a small stipend and the hopes of advancement, will offer himself as a candidate, and the real men of weight and influence, by remaining at home, add strength to the State governments ? I am at a loss to know what must be done \u2014 I despair that a republican form of govern ment can remove the difficulties. Whatever may be my opinion, I would hold it however unwise to change that form of government. I believe the British government forms the best model the world ever produced, and such has been its progress in the minds of the many, that this truth gradually gains ground. This government has for its object public strength and individual security. It is said with us to be unattainable. If it was once formed it would maintain itself. All communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first are the rich and well born, the other the mass of the people. The voice of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and how ever generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true in fact. The people are turbulent and chang ing; they seldom judge or determine right. Give there fore to the first class a distinct, permanent share in the government. They will check the unsteadiness of the second, and as they cannot receive any advantage by a change, they therefore will ever maintain good govern ment. Can a democratic assembly, who annually revolve in the mass of the people, be supposed steadily to pursue the public good? Nothing but a permanent body can"], [142, "136 SECRET PROCEEDINGS check the imprudence os democracy. Their turbulent and uncontroliiig disposition requires checks. The senate of New York, although chosen for four years, we have found to be inefficient. Will, on the Virginia plan, a con linuance of seven years do it ? It is admitted that you can not have a good executive upon a democratic plan. See the excellency of the British executive \u2014 He is placed above temptation \u2014 He can have no distinct interests from the public welfare. Nothing short of such an executive can be efficient. The weak side of a republican govern ment is the danger of foreign influence. This is unavoida ble, unless it is so constructed as to bring forward its first characters in its support. I am therefore for a general government, yet would wish to go the full lengih of repub lican principles. Let one body of the legislature be constituted during good behavior or life. Let one executive be appointed who dares execute his powers. It may be asked, is this a republican system? It is strict ly so, as long as they remain elective. And let me observe, that an executive is less dangerous to the liberties of the people when in office during life, than for seven years. It may be said this constitutes an elective monar chy! Pray what is a monarchy? May not the governors of the respective States be considered in that light ? But by making the execulive subject to impeachment, the term monarchy cannot * apply. These elective monarchs have produced tumults in Rome, and are equally dangerous to peace in Poland ; but this cannot apply to the mode ii^which I would propose the election. Let the electors be appointed in each of the States to elect the executive \u2014 [Here Mr. H. produced his plan, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed] \u2014 to consist of two branches and I would give them the unlimited power of passing"], [143, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 137 nil laws without exception. The assembly to be elected for three years by the people in districts \u2014 the senate to be elected by electors to be chosen for that purpose by the people, and to remain in office during life. The execu tive to have the power of negativing all laws \u2014 to make ,war or peace, with the advice of the senate \u2014 to make treaties with their advice, but to have the sole direction of all military operations, and to send ambassadors and appoint all military officers, and to pardon all offenders, treason excepted, unless by advice of the senate. On his death or removal, the president of the senate to offici ate, with the same powers, until another is elected. Su preme judicial officers to be appointed by the executive and the senate. The legislature to appoint courts in each State, so as to make the State governments unnecessary to it. All State laws to be absolutely void which contravene the general laws. An officer to be appointed in each State to have a negative on all State laws. All the mili tia and the appointment of officers to be under the national government. I confess that this plan and that from Virginia are very remote from the idea of the people. Perhaps the Jersey plan is nearest their expectation. But the people are gra dually ripening in their opinions of government \u2014 they begin to be tired of an excess of democracy \u2014 and what even is the Virginia plan, but pork still, with a little change of the sauce. Then adjourned to to-morrow. TUESDAY, JUNE 19th, 1787. Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. On the consideration of the first resolve of the Jersey plan. Mr. Madison. This is an important question \u2014 Many S"], [144, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 138 persons scruple the powers of the convention. If this re mark had any weight, it is equally applicable to the adop tion of either plan. The difference of drawing the powers in the one from the people and in the other from the States, does not affect the powers. There are two States in the union where the members of congress are chosen by the people. A new government must be made. Our all is depending on it ; and if we have but a clause that the peo ple will adopt, there is then a chance for our preservation. Although all the States have assented to the confederation, an infraction of any one article by one of the States is a dissolution of the whole. This is the doctrine of the civil law on treaties. Jersey pointedly refused complying with a requisition of congress, and was guilty of this infraction, although she afterwards rescinded her non-complying resolve. What is the object of a confederation ? It is two-fold \u2014 1st, to maintain the union ; 2dly, good government. Will the Jersey plan secure these points ? No ; it is still in the power of the confederated States to violate treaties \u2014 Has not Georgia, in direct violation of the confederation, made war with the Indians, and concluded treaties ? Have not Virginia and Maryland entered into a partial compact? Have not Pennsylvania and Jersey regulated the bounds of the Delaware ? Has not the State of Massachusetts, at this time, a considerable body of troops in pay ? Has not congress been obliged to pass a conciliatory act in support of a decision of their federal court between Con- necticut and Pennsylvania, instead of having the power of carrying into effect the judgment of their own court? Nor does the Jersey plan provide for a ratification by the respective States of the powers intended to be vested. It is also defective in the establishment of the judiciary, granting only an appellate jurisdiction, without providing for a second trial ; and in case the executive of a State should pardon an offender, how will it effect the definitive"], [145, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 139 judgment on appeal ? It is evident, if we do not radically depart from a federal plan, we shall share the fate of an cient and modern confederacies. The amphyctionic coun cil, like the American congress, had the power of judg ing in the last resort in war and peace \u2014 call out forces send ambassadors. What was its fate or continuance? Philip of Macedon, with little difficulty, destroyed every appearance of it. The Athenian had nearly the same fate \u2014 The Helvetic confederacy is rather a league \u2014 In the German confederacy the parts are too strong for the whole \u2014 Tho Dutch are in a most wretched situation \u2014 weak in all its parts, and only supported by surrounding contend ing powers. The rights of individuals are infringed by many of the State laws \u2014 such as issuing paper money, and instituting a mode to discharge debts differing from the form of the contract. Has the Jersey plan any checks to prevent the mischief? Does it in any instance secure internal tranquillity? Right and force, in a system like this, are synonymous terms. When force is employed to support the system, and men obtain military habits, is there no danger they may turn their arms against their employ ers? Will the Jersey plan prevent foreign influence? Did not Persia and Macedon distract the councils of Greece by acts of corruption 1 And is not Jersey and Holland at this day subject to the same distractions? Will not the plan be burdensome to the smaller States, if they have an equal representation ? But how is mili tary coercion to enforce government ? True, a smaller State may be brought to obedience, or crushed ; but what if one of the larger States should prove disobedient, are you sure you can by force effect a submission ? Suppose \u25a0we cannot agree on any plan, what will be the condition of the smaller States ? Will Delaware and Jersey be safe against Pennsylvania, or Rhode Island against Massachu setts? And how will the smaller States be situated in"], [146, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 140 case of partial confederacies? Will they not be obliged to mSke larger concessions to the greater States? The point of representation is the great point of difference, and which the greater States cannot give up ; and although there was an equalization of States, State distinctions would still exist. But this is totally impracticable ; and what would be the effect of the Jersey plan if ten or twelve new States were added? Mr. King moved that the committee rise and report that the Jersey plan is not admissible, and report the first plan. Mr. Dickinson supposed that there were good regula tions in both. Let us therefore contrast the one with the other, and consolidate such parts of them as the committee approve. Mr. King's motion was then put \u2014 For it 7 States \u2014 3 against \u2014 one divided. New York in the minority. The committee rose and reported again the first plan, and the inadmissibility of the Jersey plan. The convention then proceeded to take the first plan into consideration. The first resolve was read. Mr. Wilson. I am (to borrow a sea-phrase) for tak ing a new departure, and I wish to consider in what direc tion we sail, and what may be the end of our voyage. I am for a national government, though the idea of fede ral is, in my view, the same. With me it is not a desira ble object to annihilate the State governments, and here I differ from the honorable gentleman from New York. In all extensive empires a subdivision of power is necessary. Persia, Turkey, and Rome, under its emperors, are exam ples in point. These, although despots, found it necessary. A general government, over a great extent of territory, must, in a few years, make subordinate jurisdictions. \u2014 Alfred the great, that wise legislator, made this grada tion, and the last division on his plan amounted only to"], [147, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 141 ten territories. With this explanation, I shall be for the first resolve. Mr. Hamilton. I agree to the proposition. I did not intend yesterday a total extinguishment of State govern ments ; but my meaning was, that a national government \u2022ought to be able to support itself without the aid or inter ference of the State governments, and that therefore it was necessary to have full sovereignty. Even with cor porate rights the States will be dangerous to the national \u2022government, and ought to be extinguished, new modified, ,or reduced to a smaller scale. Mr. King. None of the States are now sovereign or independent \u2014 Many of these essential rights are vested in congress. Congress, by the confederation, possesses the rights of the United States. This is a union of the men of those States. None of the States, individually or collectively, but in congress, have the rights of peace or war. The magistracy in congress possesses the sove reignty \u2014 To certain points we are now a united people. Consolidation is already established. The confederation contains an article to make alterations \u2014 Congress have the right to propose such alterations. The 8th article respecting the quotas of the States, has been altered, and eleven States have agreed to it. Can it not be altered in other instances? It can, excepting the guarantee of the States. Mr. Martin. When the States threw off their allegi ance on Great Britain, they became independent of her, and each other. They united and confederated for mu tual defence, and this was done on principles of perfect reciprocity \u2014 They will now again meet on the same ground. But when a dissolution takes place, our origi nal rights and sovereignties are resumed. \u2014 Our acces sion to the union has been by States. If any other prin ciple is adopted by this convention, he will give it every opposition."], [148, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 142 Mr-. Wilson. The declaration of independence preced ed the State constitutions. What does this declare ? In the name of the people of these States, we are declared to be free and independent. The power of war, peace, alli ances and trade, are declared to be vested in congress. Mr. Hamilton. I agree to Mr. Wilson's remark. \u2014 Establish a weak government and you must at times over leap the bounds. Rome was obliged to create dictators. Cannot you make propositions to the people because we before confederated on other principles ? \u2014 The people can yield to them, if they will. The three great objects of go vernment, agriculture, commerce, and revenue, can only be secured by a general government. Adjourned to to-morrow morning, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 20th, 1787. Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Judge Elsworth. I propose, and therefore move, to \u2022expunge the word national, in the first resolve, and to place in the room of it, government of the United States \u2014 which was agreed to, nem. con. Mr. Lansing then moved, that the first resolve be post poned, in order to take into consideration the following : That the powers of legislation ought to be vested in the United States in congress. I am clearly of opinion that I am not authorized to ac cede to a system which will annihilate the State govern ments, and the Virginia plan is declarative of such ex tinction. It has been asserted that the public mind is not known. To some points it may be true, but we may col lect from the fate of the requisition of the impost, what it may be on the principles of a national government. \u2014 When many of the States were so tenacious of their rights on this point, can we expect that thirteen States will sur render their governments up to a national plan ? Rhode Island pointedly refused granting it. Certainly she had"], [149, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 143 a federal right so to do ; and I hold it as an undoubted truth, as long as State distinctions remain, let the na tional government be modified as you please, both branch es of your legislature will be impressed with local and State attachments. The Virginia plan proposes a nega tive on the State laws where, in the opinion of the nation al legislature, they contravene the national government : and no State Laws can pass unless approved by them. \u2014 They will have more than a law in a day to revise ; and are they competent to judge of the wants and necessities of remote States ? This national government will, from their power, have great influence in the State governments; and the exist ence of the latter are only saved in appearance. And has it not been asserted that they expect their extinc tion ? If this be the object, let us say so, and extinguish them at once. But remember, if we devise a system of government which will not meet the approbation of our constituents, we are dissolving the union \u2014 but if we act within the limits of our power, it will be approved of; and should it upon experiment prove defective, the people will entrust a future convention again to amend it. Fond as many are of a general government, do any of you be lieve it can pervade the whole continent so effectually as to secure the peace, harmony, and happiness of the whole t The excellence of the British model of government has been much insisted on ; but we are endeavoring to com plicate it with State governments, on principles which will gradually destroy the one or the other. You are sowing the seeds of rivalship, which must at last end in ruin. Mr. Mason. The material difference between the two plans has already been clearly pointed out. The objection to that of Virginia arises from the want of power to institute it, and the want of practicability to carry it into effect. Will the first objection apply to a power merely recommendatory? In certain seasons of"], [150, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 144 public danger it is commendable to exceed power. The* treaty of peace, under which we now enjoy the blessings of freedom, was made by persons who exceeded their powers. It met the approbation of the public, and thus deserved the praises of those who sent them. The ircw practicability of the plan is still less groundless. These measures are supported by one who, at his time of life,. has little to hope or expect from any government. Let me ask, will the people entrust their dearest rights and liberties to the determination of one body of men, and those not chosen by them, and who are invested both with the sword and purse? They never will \u2014 they ne ver can \u2014 to a conclave, transacting their business se cret from the eye of the public. Do we not discover by their public journals of the years 1778-9, and 1780, that factions and party spirit had guided many of their acts ? The people of America, like all other people, are unset tled in their minds, and their principles fixed to no ob ject, except that a republican government is the best, and that the legislature ought to consist of two branches. The constitutions of the respective States, made and ap proved of by them, evince this principle. Congress, however, from other causes, received a different organi zation. What, would you use military force to compel the observance of a social compact ? It is destructive to the rights of the people. Do you expect the militia will do it, or do you mean a standing army ? The first will never, on such an occasion, exert any power ; and the latter may turn its arm against the government which employs them. I never will consent to destroy State governments, and will ever be as careful to preserve the one as the other. If we should, in the formation of the latter, have omitted some necessary regulation, I will trust my posterity to amend it. That the one govern- ment will be productive of disputes and jealousies against the other, I believe ; but it will produce mutual safe-"], [151, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 145 ty, I shall close with observing, that though some gentle men have expressed much warmth on this and former occasions, I can excuse it, as the result of sudden passion ; and hope that although we may differ in some particular points, if we mean the good of the whole, that our good sense upon reflection, will prevent us from spreading our discontent further. Mr. Martin. I know that government must be sup ported ; and if the one was incompatible with the other, I would support the State government at the expense of the union \u2014 for I consider the present system as a system of slavery. Impressed with this idea, I made use on a for mer occasion, of expressions perhaps rather harsh. If gen tlemen conceive that the legislative branch is dangerous, divide them into two. They are as much the represen tatives of the States, as the State assemblies are the rep resentatives of the people. Are not the powers which we here exercise given by the legislatures ? [After giv ing a detail of the revolution and of State governments, Mr. M. continued.] I confess when the confederation was made, congress ought to have been invested with more extensive powers; but when the States saw that congress indirectly aimed at sovereignty, they were jealous, and therefore refused any farther concessions. The time is now come that we can constitutionally grant them not only new powers, but to modify their government, so that the State governments are not endangered. But whatever we have now in our power to grant, the grant is a State grant, and therefcire it must be so organized that the State governments are interested in supporting the union. Thus systematized, there can be no danger if a small force is maintained. Mr. Sherman. We have found during the war that though congress consisted of but one branch, it was that body which carried us through the whole war, and wo were crowned with success. We closed the war, per- T"], [152, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 146 forming all the functions of a good government, by mak- ing a beneficial peace. But the great difficulty now is, how we shall pay the public debt incurred during that war. The unwillingness of the States to comply with the requisitions of congress, has embarrassed us greatly.\u2014 But to amend these defects in government I am not fond of speculation. I would rather proceed on experimental ground. We can so modify the powers of congress, that we will all be mutual supporters of one another. The disparity of the States can be no difficulty. We know this by experience \u2014 Virginia and Massachusetts were the first who unanimously ratified the old confederation. They then had no claim to more votes in congress than one. \u2014 Foreign States have made treaties with us as confederated States, not as a national government. Suppose we put an end to that government under which those treaties were made, will not these treaties be void ? Mr. Wilson. The question before us may admit of the three following considerations : 1. Whether the legislature shall consist of one or two branches. 2. Whether they are to be elected by the State govern ments or by the people. 3. Whether in proportion to State importance, or States individually. Confederations are usually of a short date. The am phyctionic council was instituted in the infancy of the Grecian republics \u2014 as those grew in* strength, the coun cil lost its weight and power. The Ach\u00e6an league met tho same fate \u2014 Switzerland and Holland are supported in their confederation, not by its inlrinsic merit, but the in cumbent pressure of surrounding bodies. Germany is kept together by the house of Austria. True, congress carried us through the war even against its own weakness. That powers were wanting, you Mr. President, must have felt. To other causes, not to congress, must the"], [153, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 147 success be ascribed. That tho great States acceded to the confederation, and that they in tho hour of danger, made a sacrifice of their interest to the lesser States is true. Like the wisdom of Solomon in adjudging the child to ils true mother, from tenderness to it, the greater States well knew that the loss of a limb was fatal to the confedera tion \u2014 they too, through tenderness, sacrificed their dearest rights to preserve the whole. But the time is come, when justice will be done to their claims \u2014 Situations are al tered. Congress have frequently made their appeal to the peo ple. I wish they had always done it \u2014 the national govern ment would have been sooner extricated. Question then put on Mr. Lansing's motion and lost. \u2014 C States against 4 \u2014 one divided. New York in the mi nority. Adjourned till to-morrow morning. THURSDAY, JUNE 21st, 1787, Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Dr. Johnson \u2014 It appears to me that the Jersey plan has for its principal object, the preservation of the Slate gov ernments. So far it is a departure from the plan of Vir ginia, which although it concentres in a distinct national government, it is not totally independent of that of the States. A gentleman from New York, with boldness and decision, proposed a system totally different from both ; and though he has been praised by every body, he has been supported by none. How can the State governments be secured on the Virginia plan ? I could have wished, that the supporters of the Jersey system could have satisfied themselves with the principles of the Virginia plan, and that the individuality of the States could be supported. It is agreed on all hands that a portion of government is to be left to the States. How can this be done ? It can be done by joining the Stales in their legislative capacity with tha"], [154, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 148 right of appointing the second branch of the national le gislature, to represent the States individually. Mr. Wilson. If security is necessary to preserve tho one, it is equally so to preserve the other. How can the national government be secured against the States? Some regulation is necessary. Suppose the national government had a component number in the Stale legislature? But where the one government clashed with the other, the Stale government ought to yield, as the preservation of the gene ral interest must be preferred to a particular. But let us try to designate the powers of each, and then no danger can be apprehended, nor can the general government be possessed of any ambitious views to encroach on the State rights. Mr. Madison. I could have wished that the gentle man from Connecticut had more accurately marked his ob jections to the Virginia plan. 'I apprehend the greatest danger is from the encroachment of the States on the na tional government \u2014 This apprehension is justly sounded on the experience of ancient confederacies, and our own is a proof of it. The right of negativing in certain instances the State laws, affords one security to the national government. But is the danger well sounded? Have any State govern ments ever encroached on the corporate rights of cities? And if it was the case that the national government usurp ed the State government, if such usurpation was for tho good of the whole, no mischief could arise. \u2014 To draw tho line between the two, is a difficult task. I believe it can not be done, and therefore I am inclined for a general government. If we cannot form a general government, and the States become totally independent of each other, it would afford a melancholy prospect. The 2d resolve was then put and carried \u2014 7 States for \u20143 against \u2014 one divided. New York in the minority."], [155, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 149 The 3d resolve was then taken into consideration by the convention. Mr. Pinkney. I move that the members of the first branch be appointed in such manner as the several State le gislatures shall direct, instead of the mode reported. If this motion is not agreed to, the other will operate with great difficulty, if not injustice \u2014 If you make dislrict elections and join, as I presume you must, many coun ties in one district, the largest county will carry the elec tion as ils united influence will give a decided majority in its favor. Mr. Madison. I oppose the motion \u2014 there are difficul ties, but they may be obviated in the details connected with the subject. Mr. Hamilton. It is essential to the democratic rights of the community, that this branch be directly elected by the people. Let us look forward to probable events \u2014 There may be a time when State legislatures may cease, and such an event ought not to embarrass the national government. Mr. Mason. I am for preserving inviolably the demo cratic branch of the government \u2014 True, we have found in conveniencies from pure democracies ; but if we mean to preserve peace and real freedom, they must necessarily be come a component part of a national government. Change this necessary principle, and if the government proceeds to taxation, the States will oppose your powers. Mr. Sherman thought that an amendment to the propo sed amendment is necessary. Gov. Rutledge. It is said that an election by represen tatives is not an election by the people. This proposition is not correct. What is done by my order is done by myself. I am convinced that the mode of election by legislatures will be more refined, and better men will be sent. Mr. Wilson. The legislature of the States by the pro-"], [156, "150 SECRET PROCEEDINGS posed motion will have an uocontrolable sway over the ge neral government. Election is the exercise of original sovereignty in ihe people \u2014 but if by representatives, it is only relative sovereignty. Mr. King. The magistrates of the States will ever pursue schemes of their own, and this, on the proposed motion, will pervade the national government \u2014 and wo know the State governments will be ever hostile to the ge neral government. Mr. Pinkney. All the reasoning of the gentlemen oppo sed to my motion has not convinced me of its impropriety. There is an esprit de corps which has made heretofore every unfederal member of congress, after his election, become strictly federal, and this I presume will ever bo the case in whatever manner they may be elected. Question put on Mr. Pinkney's motion and carried by 6 States against 4 \u2014 one divided. Question then put on the resolve \u2014 9 States for \u2014 1 against \u2014 one divided. Gov. Randolph. I move that in the resolve for the du ration of the first branch of the general legislature, the word three be expunged, and the words two years be in serted. Mr. Dickinson. I am against the amendment. I pro pose that the word three shall remain, but that they shall be removable annually in classes. Mr. Sherman. I am for one year. Our people are accustomed to annual elections. Should the members have a longer duration of service, and remain at the seat of government, they may forget their constituents, and perhaps imbibe the interest of the State in which they re side, or there may be danger of catching the esprit de corps. Mr. Mason. I am for two years. One year is too short. \u2014 In extensive States four months may elapse be fore the returns can be known.

Judge Elsworth. I object to this clause. I think the State legislatures ought to provide for the members of the general legislature, and as each State will have a propor tionate number, it will not be burdensome to the smaller States. I therefore move to strike out the clause. Mr. Gorham. If we intend to six ihe stipend, it may be an objection against the system, as the States would never adopt it. I join in sentiment to strike out the whole. Gov. Randolph. I am against the motion. Are the members to be paid ? Certainly \u2014 We have no sufficient fortunes to induce gentlemen to attend for nothing. If the State legislatures pay the members of the national council, they will control the members, and compel them to pursue State measures. I confess the payment will not operate impartially, but the members must be paid,"], [158, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 152 and be made easy in their circumstances. Will' they at- tend the service of the public without being paid ? Mr. Sherman. The States ought to pay their mem bers; and I judge of the approbation of the people on matters of government by what I suppose they will ap prove. Mr. Wilson. I am against going as far as the resolve. If, however, it is intended to throw the national legislature into the hand of the States, I shall be against it. It is possible the States may become unfederal, and they may then shake the national government. The members ought to be paid out of the national treasury. Mr. Madison. Our attention is too much confined to the present moment, when our regulations are intend ed to be perpetual. Our national government must operate for the good of the whole, and the people must have a general interest in its support ; but if you make its legislators subject to and at the mercy of the State go vernments, you ruin the fabric \u2014 and whatever new States may be added to the general government the expense will be equally borne. Mr. Hamilton. I do not think the States ought to pay the members, nor am I for a fixed sum. It is a general remark, that he who pays is the master. If each State pays its own members, the burden would be disproportion ate, according to the distance of the States from the seat of government. Isa national government can exist, mem bers will make it a desirable object to attend, without ac cepting any stipend \u2014 and it ought to be so organized as to be efficient. ' Mr. Wilson. I move that the stipend be ascertained by the legislature, and paid out of the national treasury. Mr. Madison. I oppose this motion. Members are too much interested in the question.

Mr. Mason moved to change the phraseology of the re solve, that is to say, to receive an adequate compensation for their services, and to be paid out of the treasury. This motion was agreed to. stir. Rutledge, I move that the question be taken on these words, to be paid out of the national treasury. Mr. Hamilton. It has been often asserted, that the in terests of the general and of the State legislatures are pre cisely the same. This cannot be true. The views of the governed are often materially different from those who govern. The science of policy is the knowledge of human nature. A State government will ever be the ri val power of the general government. It is therefore highly improper that the State legislatures should be the paymasters of the members of the national government. All political bodies love power, and it will often be impro perly attained. Judge Elsworth. If we are so exceedingly jealous of State legislatures, will they not have reason to be equally jealous of us? If I return to my State and tell them, we made such and such regulations for a general govern ment, because we dared not trust you with any extensive powers, will they be satisfied ? nay, will they adopt your government? and let it ever be remembered, that without their approbation your government is nothing more than a rope of sand. Mr. Wilson. I am not for submitting the national govern ment to the approbation of the State legislatures. I know that they and the State officers will oppose it. I am for car rying it to the people of each State. Mr. Rutledge's motion was then put \u2014 i States for the clause\u2014 5 against \u2014 2 divided. New York divided.

Mr. Gorham. I move that after the words, and under the national government for one year after its expiraton, be struck out. Mr. King for the motion. It is impossible to carry the system of exclusion so far ; and in this instance wo refine too much by going to Utopian lengths. It is a mere cobweb.** Mr. Butler. We have no way of judging of mankind but by experience. Look at the history of the govern ment of Great Britain, where there is a very flimsy exclu sion \u2014 Does it not ruin their government ? A man taltes a seat in parliament to get an office for himself or friends, or both ; and this is the great source 'from which flows its great venality and corruption. Mr. Wilson. I am for striking out the words moved for. Strong reasons must induce me to disqualify a good man from office. If you do, you give an opportunity to the de pendent or avaricious man to fill it up, for to them offices are objects of desire. If we admit there may be cabal and intrigue between the executive and legislative bodies, the exclusion of one year will not prevent the effects of it. But we ought to hold forth every honorable inducement for men of abilities to enter the service of the public. \u2014 This is truly a republican principle. Shall talents, which entitle a man to public reward, operate as a punishment? While a member of the legislature, he ought to be exclud ed from any other office, but no longer. Suppose a war breaks out, and a number of your best military characters were members ; must we lose the benefit of their servi ces ? Had this been the case in the beginning of the war, what would have been our situation ? \u2014 and what has hap-* pened may happen again."], [161, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 155 Mr. Madison. Some gentlemen give too much weight, and others too little to this subject. If you have no ex clusive clause, there may be danger of creating officers or augmenting the stipends of those already created, in order to gratify some members if they were not excluded. Such an instance has fallen within my own observation. I am therefore of opinion, that no office ought to be open to a member, which may be created or augmented while he is in the legislature. Mr. Mason. It seems as if it was taken for granted, that all offices will be filled by the executive, while I think many will remain in the gift of the legislature. In either case, it is necessary to shut the door against corruption. If otherwise^ they may make or multiply offices, ih order to fill them. Are gentlemen in earnest when they suppose that this exclusion will prevent the first characters from coming forward ? Are we not struck at seeing the luxu ry and venality which has already crept in among iis ? If not checked, we shall have ambassadors to every petty state in Europe \u2014 the little republic of St. Marino not ex cepted. We must, in the present system, remove the temptation. I admire many parts of the British consti tution and government, but I detest their corruption. \u2014 Why has the power of the crown so remarkably increas ed the last century? A stranger; by reading their laws, would suppose it considerably diminished ; and yet, by the sole power of appointing the increased officers of gov ernment, corruption pervades every town and village in the kingdom. If such a restriction should abridge the right of election, it is still necessary, as it will prevent the people from ruining themselves ; and will not the same causes here produce the same effects ? I consider this clause as the corner-stone on which our liberties de pend \u2014 and if we strike it out we are erecting a fabric for our destruction. Mr. Gorham. The -corruption of the English govern-"], [162, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 156 ment cannot be applied to America. This evil exists there in the venality of their boroughs : but even this cor ruption has its advantage, as it gives stability lo their gov ernment. We do not know what the effect would be if members of parliament were excluded from offices. The great bulwark of our liberty is ihe frequency of elections, and their great danger is the septennial parliaments. Mr. Hamilton. In all general questions which become the subjects of discussion, there are always some truths mixed with falsehoods. I confess there is danger where men are capable of holding two offices. Take mankind in general, they are vicious \u2014 their passions may be operat- ed upon. We have been taught to reprobate the danger of influence in the British government, without duly reflect- ing how far it was necessary to support a good govern- ment. We have taken up many ideas upon trust, and at last, pleased with our own opinions, establish them as undoubted trujhs. Hume's opinion of the British con- stitution confirms the remark, that there is always a body of firm patriots, who often shake a corrupt administration. Take mankind as they are, and what are they governed by ? Their passions. There may be in every government a few choice spirits, who may act from more worthy motives. One great error is that we suppose mankind more honest than they are. Our prevailing passions are ambition and interest ; and it will ever be the duty of a wise government to avail itself of those passions, in order to make them subservi- ent to the public good \u2014 for these ever induce us to ac- tion. Perhaps a few men in a state may, from patriotic motives, or to display their talents, or to reap the advantage of public applause, step forward ; but if we adopt the clause we destroy the motive. I am, therefore, against all exclusions and refinements, except only in this case; that when a member takes his seat, he should vacate every other office. It is difficult to put any exclusive re-"], [163, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 157 gulation into effect. We must, in some degree, submit to the inconvenience. The question was then put for striking out \u2014 4 ayes \u2014 4 noes \u2014 3 States divided. New York of the number. Adjourned till to-morrow morning. SATURDAY JUNE 23d, 1787. Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Mr. Gorham. I move that the question which was yes terday proposed on the clause, to be paid out of the na tional treasury, be now put. Question put \u2014 5 ayes \u2014 5 noes \u2014 one State divided. So the clause was lost. Mr. Pinkney moved that that part of the clause which disqualifies a person from holding an office in the Stale, be expunged, because the first and best characters in a State may thereby be deprived of a seat in the nalional council. Mr. Wilson. I perceive that some gentlemen are of opinion to give a bias in favor of State governments \u2014 This question ought to stand on the same footing. Mr. Sherman. By the conduct of some gentlemen, we are erecting a kingdom to act against itself. The legisla ture ought to be free and unbiassed. Question put to strike out the words moved for, and car ried \u2014 8 ayes \u2014 3 noes. Mr. Madison then moved, that after the word estab lished, be added, or the emoluments whereof shall have been augmented by the legislature of the United States, du ring the time they were members thereof, and for one year thereafter. Mr. Butler. The proposed amendment does not go far enough. How easily may this be evaded. What was the conduct of George the second to support the pragmatic sanction ? To some of the opposers he gave pensions \u2014 others offices, and some, to put them outof the"], [164, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 158 house of commons, he made lords. The great Monies-* quieu says, it is unwise to entrust persons with power, which bv being abused operates to the advantage of those entrust ed with it. Governor Rutledge was against the proposed amend ment. No person ought to come to the legislature with an eye to his own emolument in any shape. Mr. Mason. I differ from my colleague in his pro posed amendment. Let me state the practice in the State where we came from. Therej all officers are appointed by the legislature. Need I add, lhat many of their appoint ments are most shameful. Nor will the check proposed by this amendment be sufficient. It will soon cease to be any check at all. It is asserted that it will be very difficult to find men sufficiently qualified as legislators without the inducement of emolument. I do believe that men of genius will be deterred unless possessed of great virtues. We may well dispense with the first characters when destitute of virtue \u2014 I should wish them never to come \u25a0forward\u2014 But if we do not provide against corruption, our government will soon be at an end : nor would I wish to put a man of virtue in the way of temptation. Evasions and caballing would evade the amendment. Nor would the danger be less, if the executive has the appointment of officers. The first three or four years we might go on well enough ; but what would be the case afterwards ? I will add, that such a govern ment ought to be refused by the people \u2014 and it will be refused. Mr. Madison. My wish is that the national legisla ture be as uncorrupt as possible. I believe all public bodies are inclined, from various motives, to support its members ; but it is not always done from the base mo tives of venality. Friendship, and a knowledge of the abilities of those with whom they associate, may produce it. If you bar the door against such attachments, you"], [165, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 15S deprive the government os its greatest strength and sup port. Can you always rely on the patriotism of the members? If this be the only inducement, you will find a great indifferency in filling your legislative body. If wo expect to call forth useful characters, we must hold out allurements ; nor can any great inconveniency arise from such inducements. The legislative body must be tho road to public honor ; and the advantage will be greater to adopt my motion, than any possible incon venience. Mr. King. The intimate association of offices will produce a vigorous support to your government. To check it would produce no good consequences. Sup pose connections are formed ? Do they not all tend to strengthen the government under which they are formed ? Let therefore preferment be open to all men. We re fine otherwise too much \u2014 nor is it possible we can eradi cate the evil. Mr. Wilson. I hope the amendment will be adopted. \u2014 By the last vote it appears that the convention have no apprehension of danger of State appointments. It is equally imaginary to apprehend any from the national government. That such officers will have influence in the legislature, I readily admit; but I would not there fore exclude them. If any ill effects were to result from it, the bargain can as well be made with the legislature as with the executive. We ought not to shut the door of promotion against the great characters in the public councils, from being rewarded by being promoted. If otherwise, will not these gentlemen be put in the legislatures to prevent them from holding offices, by those who wish to enjoy them themselves ? Mr. Sherman. If we agree to this amendment, our good intentions may be prostrated by changing offices to avoid or evade the rule."], [166, "160 SECRET PROCEEDINGS Mr. Gerry. This amendment is of great weight, and its consequences ought to be well considered. At the beginning of the war we possessed more than Roman virtue. It appears to me it is now the reverse. We have more land and stock-jobbers than any place on earth. \u2014 It appears to me, that we have constantly endeavored to keep distinct the three great branches of government ; but if we agree to this motion, it must be destroyed by admitting the legislators to share in the executive, or to be too much influenced by the executive, in looking up to him for offices. Mr. Madison. This question is certainly of much mo ment. There are great advantages in appointing such persons as are known. The choice otherwise will be chance. How will it operate on the members themselves ? Will it not be an objection to become members when they are to be excluded from office ? For these reasons I am for the amendment. Mr. Butler. These reasons have no force. Characters fit for offices will always be known. Mr. Mason. It is said it is necessary to open the door to induce gentlemen to come into the legislature. This door is open, but not immediately. A seat in the house will be the field to exert talents, and when to a good purpose, they will in due time be rewarded. Mr. Jenifer. Our senators are appointed for 5 years and they can hold no other office. This circumstance gives them the greatest confidence of the people. The question was put on Mr. Madison's amendment, and lost \u2014 8 noes \u2014 2 ayes \u2014 one State divided. Question on the clause as amended before. Carried \u2014 8 ayes\u2014 -2 noes \u2014 one State divided. The question was next on the latter part of the clause. Mr. Mason. We must retain this clause, otherwise evasions may be made.

Mr. Gerry. And this actually has been the case in con gress \u2014 a member resigned to obtain an appointment, and had it failed he would have resumed it. Mr. Hamilton. The clause may be evaded many ways. Offices may be held by proxy \u2014 they may be procured by friends, &c. Mr. Rutledge. I admit, in some cases, it may be evad ed ; but this is no argument against shutting the door as close as possible. The question was then put on this clause, to wit : and for the space of one year after its expiration \u2014 and nega tived. Then adjourned to Monday morning, MONDAY, JUNE 25th, 1787. Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Mr. C. Pinkney. On the question upon the second branch of the general legislature, as reported by the committee in the fourth resolve, now under consideration, it will be necessary to inquire into the true situation of the people of this country. Without this we can form no adequate idea what kind of government will secure their rights and liberties. There is more equality of rank and for tune in America than in any other country under the sun ; and this is likely to continue as long as the unappropriated western lands remain unsettled. They are equal in rights, nor is extreme of poverty to be seen in any part of the union. If we are thus singularly situated, both as to fortune and rights, it evidently follows, that we cannot draw any useful lessons from the examples of any of the European states or kingdoms ; much less can Great Britain afford us any striking institution, which can be adapted to our own situation \u2014 unless we indeed intend to establish an hereditary executive, or one for life. Great Britain drew V"], [168, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 162 its first rude institutions from the forests of Germany, and wilh it that of its nobility. These having originally in their hands the properly of the State, the crown of Great Britain was obliged to yield to the claims of power which those large possessions enabled them to assert. The commons were then too contemptible to form part of the national councils. Many parliaments were held, without their being represented until in pro cess of time, under the protection of the crown, and forming distinct communities, they obtained some weight in the British government. From such discordant ma terials brought casually together, those admirable checks and balances, now so much the boast of the British con stitution, took their rise. \u2014 But will we be able to copy from this original? I do not suppose that in the confede ration, there are one hundred gentlemen of sufficient for tunes to establish a nobility ; and the equality of others as to rank would never admit of the distinctions of nobility. I lay it therefore down as a settled ptinciple, that equality of condition is a leading axiom in our government. It may be said we must necessarily establish checks, lest one rank of people should usurp the rights of another. Com merce can never interfere with the government, nor give a complexion to its councils. Can we copy from Greece or Rome ? Have we their nobles or patricians ? With them offices were open to few\u2014 The different ranks in the com munity formed opposite interests and produced unceasing struggles and disputes. Can this apply equally to the freo yeomanry of America? We surely differ from the whole- Our situation is unexampled, and it is in our power, on different grounds,, to secure civil and religious liberty; and when we secure these we secure every thing that is necessary to establish happiness. We cannot pretend to rival the European nations in their grandeur or power; nor is the situation of any two nations so exactly alike as that the one can adopt the regulations or government of"], [169, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 16J the other. If we have any distinctions they may ba divided into three classes. I. Professional men. 2. Commercial men. 3. The landed interest. The latter is the governing power of America, and the other two must ever be dependent on them \u2014 Will a national government suit them ? No. The three or ders have necessarily a mixed interest, and in that view, I repeat it again, the United States of America compose in fact but one order. The clergy and nobility of Great Britain can never be adopted by us. Our government must be made suitable to the people, and we are perhaps the only people in the world who ever had sense enough to appoint delegates to establish a general government. I believe that the propositions from Virginia, with some amendments, will satisfy the people. But a general go vernment must not be made dependent on the State gov ernments. The United States include a territory of about 1500 miles in length, and in breadth about 400 ; the whole of which is divided into States and districts. While we were dependent on the crown of Great Btitain, it was in con- templation to have formed the whole into one \u2014 but it was found impracticable. No legislature could make good laws for the whole, nor can it now be done. It would necessarily place the power in the hands of the few, nearest the seat of government. State governments must therefore remain, if you mean to prevent confusion. The general negative powers will support the general government. Upon these considerations I am led to form the second branch differently from the report. Their pow- ers are important and the number not too large, upon the principle of proportion. I have considered the subject with great attention: and I propose this plan (reads it) and if no better plan is proposed, I will then move its adoption."], [170, "164 SECRET PROCEEDINGS Mr. Randolph moved that the 4th resolve be divided, in the same manner as the 3d resolve. Mr. Gorham moved the question on the first resolve. \u2014 Sixteen members from one State will certainly have great er weight, than the same number of members from differ ent States. We must therefore depart from this rule of apportionment in some shape or other \u2014 perhaps on the plan Mr. Pinkney has suggested. Mr. Read. Some gentlemen argue, that the repre sentation must be determined according to the weight of each State \u2014 That we have heretofore been partners in trade, in which we all put in our respective proportions of stork \u2014 That the articles of our co-partnership were drawn in forming the confederation \u2014 And that before we make a new co-partnership, we must first settle the old business. But to drop the allusion \u2014 we find that the great States have appropriated to themselves the com mon lands in their respective States \u2014 These lands hav ing been forfeited as heretofore belonging to the king, ought to be applied to the discharge of our public debts. \u2014 Let this still be done, and then if you please, proportion the representation, and we shall not be jealous of one another \u2014 A jealousy, in a great measure, owing to the public property appropriated by individual States \u2014 and which, as it has been gained by the united power of the confederation, ought to be appropriated to the discharge of the public debts. Mr. Gorham. This motion has been agitated often in congress ; and it was owing to the want of power, rather than inclination, that it was not justly settled. Great sur renders have been made by the great States, for the bene fit of the confederation. Mr. Wilson. The question now before us is, whether the second branch of the general legislature shall or shall not be appointed by the State legislatures. In every point of view it is an important question. The magni-"], [171, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 165 tude of the object is indeed embarrassing. The great system of Henry the IV of France, aided by the greatest statesmen, is small when compared to the fabric we are now about to erect \u2014 In laying the stone amiss we may injure the superstructure ; and what will be the conse quence, if ihe corner-stone should be loosely placed 1 It is improper that the State legislatures should have the power contemplated to be given them. A citizen of Ame rica may be considered in two points of view \u2014 as a citi zen of the general government, and as a citizen of the particular State in which he may reside. We ought to consider in what character he acts in forming a general government. I am both a citizen of Pennsylvania and of the United States. I must therefore lay aside my State connections and act for the general good of the whole. \u2014 We must forget our local habits and attachments. The general government should not depend on the State gov ernments. This ought to be a leading distinction be tween the one and the other ; nor ought the general gov ernment to be composed of an assemblage of different State governments \u2014 We have unanimously agreed to es tablish a general government \u2014 That the powers of peace, war, treaties, coinage and regulating of commerce, ought to reside in that government. And if we reason in this manner, we shall soon see the impropriety of ad mitting the interference of State governments into the general government. Equality of representation can not be established, if( the second branch is elecied by the State legislatures. When we are laying the foun dation of a building, which is to last for ages, and in which millions are interested, it ought to be well laid. If the national government does not act upon State preju dices, State distinctions will be lost. I therefore move, that the second branch of the legislature of the national go vernment be elected by electors chosen by the people of the United States."], [172, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 166 Judge Elsworth. I think the second branch of the gen- eral legislature ought to be elected agreeable to (he report. The other way, it is said, will be more the choice of the people \u2014 The one mode is as much so as the other. No doubt every citizen of every State is interested in the State governments ; and elect him in whatever manner you please, whenever he takes a seat in the general government, it will prevail in some shape or other. The State legis- latures are more competent to make a judicious choice, than the people at large. Instability pervades their choice. In the second branch of the general government we want wisdom and firmness. As to balances, where nothing can be balanced, it is a perfect Utopian scheme. But still greater advantages will result in having a second branch endowed with the qualifications I have mentioned. Their weight and wisdom may check the inconsiderate and hasty proceedings of the first branch. I cannot see the force of the reasoning in attempting to detach the State governments from the general government. In that case, without a standing army, you cannot support the general government, but on tho pillars of the State governments. Are the larger States now more energetic than the smaller ? Massachu setts cannot support a government at the distance of one hundred miles from her capital, without an army ; and how long Virginia and Pennsylvania will support their governments it is difficult to say. Shall we proceed like unskilful workmen, and make use of timber, which is too weak to build a first rate ship ? We know that tho people of the States are strongly attached to their own constitutions. If you hold up a system of general govern ment, destructive of their constitutional rights, they will oppose it. Some are of opinion that if we cannot form a general government so as to destroy State governments, we ought at least to balance the one against the other. On the contrary, the only chance we have to support a gen-"], [173, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 167 eral government is to graft it on the Stale governments. I want to proceed on this ground, as the safest, and I bo lieve no other plan is practicable. In this way, and in this way only, can we rely on the confidence and sup port of the people. Dr. Johnson. The State governments must be preserv. ed : but this motion leaves them at the will and pleasure of the genera! government. Mr. Madison. I find great differences of opinion in this convention on the clause now under consideration. Let us postpone it in order to take up the 8th resolve, that we may previously determine the mode of represen tation. Mr. Mason. All agree that a more efficient government is necessary. It is equally necessary to preserve the State governments, as they ought to have the means of self-de fence. On the motion of Mr. Wilson, tho only means they ought to have would be destroyed. The question was put for postponing, in order to take into consideration the 8th resolve, and lost \u2014 7 noes\u2014 4 ayes.

Mr. Gorham proposed that the senators be classed, and to remain 4 years in office; otherwise great incon veniences may arise if a dissolution should take place at once. Governor Randolph. This body must act with firmness. They may possibly always sit \u2014 perhaps to aid the exe cutive. The State governments will always attempt to counteract the general government. They ought to go out in classes ; therefore I move, that they go out of office in fixed proportions of time, instead of the words, seven years."], [174, "168 SECRET PROCEEDINGS Mr. Read moved (thoutdi not seconded) lhat they ought lo continue in office during good behaviour. Mr. Williamson moved that they remain in office for six years. Mr. Pinkney. I am for four years. Longer time would give them too great attachment to the States where the general government may reside. They may be induced, from the proposed length of lime, lo sell their estates, and become inhabitants near ihe seat of government. Mr. Madison. We are proceeding in the same man ner that was done when the confederation was first formed.

I am still of opinion that classes will be necessary, but I would alter the time. I therefore move that the senators be elected for 6 years, and that the rota tion be triennial. Mr. Pinkney. I oppose the time, because of too long a continuance. The members will by this means be too long separated from their constituents, and will imbibe"], [175, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 169 attachments different from that of the State; nor is there any danger that members, by a shorter duration of office, will not support the interest of the union, or that the State3 will oppose the general interest. The State of South Ca rolina was never opposed in principle to congress, nor thwarted their views in any case, except in the requisition of money, and then only for want of power to comply \u2014 for it was found there was not money enough in the State to pay their requisition. Mr. Read moved that the term of nine years be inserted, in triennial rotation. Mr. Madison. We are now to determine whether the republican form shall be the basis of our government. \u2014 I admit there is weight in the objection of the gentleman from South Carolina ; but no plan can steer clear of ob jections. That great powers are to be given, there is no doubt ; and that those powers may be abused is equally true. It is also probable that members may lose their at tachments to the States which sent them \u2014 Yet the first branch will control them in many of their abuses. But we are now forming a body on whose wisdom we mean to rely, and their permanency in office secures a pro per field in which they may exert their firmness and knowledge. Democratic communities may be unsteady, and be led to action by the impulse of the moment. \u2014 Like individuals, they may be sensible of their own weakness, and may desire the counsels and checks of friends to guard them against the turbulency and weakness of unruly passions. Such are the various pursuits of this life, that in all civilized countries, the interest of a community will be divided. There will be debtors and creditors, and an unequal possession of property, and hence arises different views and different objects in government. This indeed is the ground-work of aristocracy ; and we find it blended in every government, both ancient and modern. Even where titles have sur- W"], [176, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 170 vived property, we discover the noble beggar haughty and assuming. The man who is possessed of wealth, who lolls on his sofa, or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge of the wants or feelings of the day laborer. The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed interest, at present, is prevalent ; but in process of time, when we approximate to the states and kingdoms of Eu rope; when the number of landholders shall be com paratively small, through the various means of trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in future elections, and unless wisely pro vided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of the landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to se cure ifie permanent interests of the country against inno vation. Landholders ought to have a share in the govern ment, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The senale, therefore, ought to be this body ; and to an swer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability. Various have been the propositions ; but my opinion'is, the longer they continue in office, the better will these views be answered. \\ Mr. Sherman. The two objects of this body are per manency and safety to those who are to be governed. A bad government is the worse for being long. Frequent elections give security and even permanency. In Connec ticut we have existed 132 years under an annual govern ment ; and as long as a man behaves himself well, he is never turned out of office. Four years to the senate is quite sufficient when you add to it the rotation proposed. Mr. Hamilton. This question has already been con-"], [177, "OF THE FEOERAL CONVENTION. 171 sidered in several points of view. We are now forming a republican government. Real liberty is neither found in despotism or the extremes of democracy, but in moderate governments. Those who mean to form a solid republican govern ment, ought to proceed to the confines of another govern ment. As long as offices are open to all men, and no constitutional rank is established, it is pure republicanism. But if we incline too much to democracy, we shall soon shoot into a monarchy. The difference of property is already great amongst us. Commerce and industry will still increase the disparity. Your government must meet this state of things, or combinations will in pro cess of time, undermine your system. What was the tribunitial power of Rome ? It was instituted by the plebeians as a guard against the patricians. But was this a sufficient check? No \u2014 The only distinction which re mained at Rome was, at last, between the rich and the poor. The gentleman from Connecticut forgets that the democratic body is already secure in a representation. \u2014 As to Connecticut, what were the little objects of their go vernment before the revolution? Colonial concerns mere ly. They ought now to act on a more extended scale, and dare they do this ? Dare they collect the taxes and requi sitions of congress? Such a government may do well, if they do not tax, and this is precisely their situation. Mr. Gerry. It appears to me that the American peo ple have the greatest aversion to monarchy, and the near er our government approaches to it, the less chance have we for their approbation. Can gentlemen suppose that the reported system can be approved of by them ? Demagogues are the great pests of our government, and have occasioned most of our distresses. If four years aro insufficient, a future convention may lengthen the time. Mr. Wilson. The motion is now for nine years, and"], [178, "172 SECRET PROCEEDINGS a triennial rotation. Every nation attends to its foreign intercourse \u2014 to support its commerce \u2014 to prevent foreign contempt, and to make war and peace. Our senate will be possessed of these powers, and therefore ought to be dignified and permanent, What is the reason that Great Britain does not enter into a commercial treaty with us ? Because congress has not the power to enforce its observance. But give them those powers, and give them the stability proposed by the motion, and they will have more permanency than a monarchical government. The great objection of many is, that this duration would give birth to views inconsistent with the interests of the union. This can have no weight, if the triennial rotation is adopted ; and this plan may possibly tend to concili ate the minds of the members of the convention on this subject, which have varied more than on any other ques tion. The question was then put on Mr. Read's motion, and lost, 8 noes \u2014 3 ayes. The question on 5 years, and a biennial rotation, was carried \u2014 7 ayes \u2014 4 noes. New York in the minority.

The question was then put on the clause, and lost \u2014 5 ayes \u2014 6 noes. It was moved to strike out the clause, to be ineligible to any State office. Mr. Madison. Congress heretofore depended on State interests \u2014 we are now going to pursue the same plan. Mr. Wilson. Congress has been ill managed, because particular States controlled the union. In this conven tion, if a proposal is made promising independency to the general government, before we have done with it, it is so modified and changed as to amount to nothing. In the present case, the States may say, although I appoint you for six years, yet if you are against the State, your table will be unprovided. Is this the way you are to erect an independent government? Mr. Butler. This second branch I consider as the aristocratic part of our government ; and they must be controlled by the States, or they will be too indepen dent. Mr. Pinkney, The States and general government must stand together. On this plan have I acted through out the whole of this business. I am therefore for expung ing the clause.

The 6th resolve was postponed, in order to take into consideration the 7th and Sth resolves. The first clause of the 7th was proposed for consideration, which res pected the suffrage of each State in the first branch of the legislature. [Mr. Martin, the attorney general from Maryland, spoke on this subject upwards of three hours. As his arguments were too diffuse, and in many instances desul tory, it was not possible to trace him through the whole, or to methodize his ideas into a systematic or argumenta tive arrangement. I shall therefore only note such points as I conceive merit most particular notice.] The question is important, (said Mr. Martin,) and I have already expressed my sentiments on the subject. \u2014 My opinion is, that the general government ought to pro tect and secure the State governments \u2014 others, however, are of a different sentiment, and reverse the principle. The present reported system is a perfect medley of confederated and national government, without example and without precedent. Many who wish the general gov ernment to protect the State governments, are anxious to have the line of jurisdiction well drawn and defined, so that they may not clash. This suggests the necessity of having this line well detailed \u2014 possibly this may be done. If we do this, the people will be convinced that we meant well to the State governments ; and should there be any defects, they will trust a future oonvention with the power of making further amendments. A general government may operate on individuals in cases of general concern, and still be federal. This dis tinction is with the States, as Stales, represented by the people of those States. States will take care of their in-"], [181, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 175 ternal police and local concerns. The general govern ment has no interest but the protection of the whole. Every other government must fail. We are proceeding in forming this government as if there were no State go vernments at all. The States must approve, or you will have none at all. I have never heard of a confederacy having two legislative branches. Even the celebrated Mr. Adams, who talks so much of checks and balances, does not suppose it necessary in a confederacy. Public and do mestic debts are our great distress. The treaty between Virginia and Maryland about the navigation of the Chesa peake and Potomac, is no infraction of the confederacy. The corner-stone of a federal government is equality of votes. States may surrender this right ; but if they do, their liberties are lost. If I err on this point, it is the error of the head, not of the heart. The first principle of government is founded on the natural rights of individuals, and in perfect equality. Locke, Vattcl, Lord Somers, and Dr. Priestly, all confirm this principle. This principle of equality, when applied to individuals, is lost in some degree, when he becomes a member of a society, to which it is transferred; and this society, by the name of state or kingdom, is, with respect to others, again on a perfect footing of equality \u2014 a right to govern themselves as they please. Nor can any other state, of right, deprive them of this equality, If such a state confederates, it is intended for the good of the whole ; and if it again confederate, those rights must be well guarded. Nor can any state de mand a surrender of any of those rights ; if it can, equali ity is already destroyed. We must treat as free States with each other, upon the same terms of equality that men originally formed themselves into societies. Vattel, Rutherford, and Locke, are united in support of the posi tion, that states, as to each other, are in a state of na ture."], [182, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 176 Thus, says Mr. Martin, have I travelled with the most respectable authorities in support of principles, all tending to prove the equality of independent states. This is equally applicable to the smallest as well as the largest states, on the true principles of reciprocity and political freedom. Unequal confederacies can never produce good effects. Apply this to the Virginia plan. Out of the number 90, Virginia has 16 votes, Massachusetts 14, Pennsylvania 12 \u2014 in all 42. Add to this a State having four votes, and it gives a majority in the general legislature. Conse quently, a combination of these States will govern the re maining nine or ten states. Where is the safety and independency of those States? Pursue this subject far ther. The executive is to be appointed by the legisla ture, and becomes the execulive in consequence of this undue influence. And hence flows the appointment of all your officers, civil, military, and judicial. The executive is also to have a negative on all laws. Suppose the possi bility of a combination of ten States \u2014 he negatives a law \u2014 it is totally lost, because those States cannot form two-thirds of the legislature. I am willing to give up private interest for the public good \u2014 but I must be satisfied first, that it is the public interest \u2014 and who can decide this point? A ma jority only of the union. The Lacedemonians insisted, in the amphyctionic coun cil, to exclude some of the smaller states from a right to vote, in order that they might tyrannize over them. If the plan now on the table be adopted, three States in the union have the control, and they may make use of their power when they please. If there exists no separate interests, there is no danger of an equality of votes ; and if there be danger, the smaller States cannot yield. If the foundation of the existing confederation is well laid, powers may be added \u2014 You may safely add a third story to a house where the foun-"], [183, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 177 dation is good. Read then the votes and proceedings of congress on forming the confederation \u2014 Virginia only was opposed to the principle of equality \u2014 The smaller States yielded rights, not the large States \u2014 They gave up their claim to the unappropriated lands with the tenderness of the mother recorded by Solomon \u2014 they sacrificed affec tion to the preservation of others. New Jersey and Mary laud rendered more essential services during the war than many of the larger States. The partial representation in congress is not the cause of its weakness, but the want of power. I would not trust a government organized upon the reported plan, for all ihe slaves of Carolina or the horses and oxen of Massachusetts. Price says, that laws made by one man, or a set of men, and not by common consent, is slavery \u2014 And it is so when applied to States, if you give them an unequal representation. What are called human feelings in this instance are only the feelings of ambition and the lust of power. Adjourned till to-morrow morning. THURSDAY, JUNE 28th, 1787. Met pursuant to adjournment. Mr. Martin in continuation. On federal grounds, it is said, that a minority will govern a majority \u2014 but on the Virginia plan a minority would tax a majority. In a federal government, a majority of states must and ought to tax. In the local government of states, counties may be unequal \u2014 still numbers, not property, govern. What is tho govern ment now forming, over States or persons ? As to the latter, their rights cannot be the object of a general go vernment \u2014 These are already secured by their guardians, the State governments. The general government is there fore intended only to protect and guard the rights of the States as Stales. X"], [184, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 178 This general government, I believe, is the first upon earth which gives checks against democracies or aris tocracies. The only necessary check in a general go vernment ought to be a restraint to prevent its absorb ing the powers of the State governments. Representation on federal principles can only flow from State societies. Representation and taxation are ever inseparable \u2014 not according to the quantum of property, but the quantum of freedom. Will the representatives of a State forget State interests? The mode of election cannot change it. These prejudices cannot be eradicated \u2014 Yrour general government cannot be just or equal upon the Virginia plan, unless you abolish State interests. If this cannot be done, you must go back to principles purely federal. On this latter ground the State legislatures and their constituents will have no interests to pursue different from the general government, and both will be interested to sup port each other. Under these ideas can it be expected that the people can approve the Virginia plan? But it is said, the people, not the State legislatures, will be called upon for approbation \u2014 with an evident design to separate the in terest of the governors from the governed. What must be the consequence ? Anarchy and confusion. We lose the idea of the powers with which we are entrusted. The le gislatures must approve. By them it must, on your own plan, be laid before the people. How will such a govern ment, over so many great Stales, operate ? Wherever new settlements have been formed in large States, they imme diately want to shake off their independency. Why ? Be cause the government is too remote for their good. The people want it nearer home. The basis of all ancient and modern confederacies is the freedom and the independency of the States composing it. The states forming the amphyctionic council were equal, though Lacedemon, one of the greatest states, at-"], [185, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 179 tempted the exclusion of three of the lesser States from this right. The plan reported, it is true, only intends to diminish those rights, not to annihilate them \u2014 It was the ambition and power of the great Grecian states which at last ruined this respectable council. The States as socie ties are ever respectful. Has Holland or Switzerland ever complained of the equality of the states which com pose their respective confederacies? Bern and Zurich are larger than the remaining eleven cantons \u2014 so of ma ny of the states of Germany ; and yet their governments are not complained of. Bern alone might usurp the whole power of the Helvetic confederacy, but she is contented still with being equal. The admission of the larger States into the confedera tion, on the principles of equality, is dangerous \u2014 But on the Virginia system, it is ruinous and destructive. Still it is the true interest of all the States to confederate \u2014 It is their joint efforts which must protect and secure us from foreign danger, and give us peace and harmony at home. [Here Mr. Martin entered into a detail of the compa rative powers of each State, and stated their probable weak ness and strength.] , At the beginning of our troubles with Great Britain, the smaller States were attempted to be cajoled to submit to the views of that nation, lest the larger States should usurp their rights. We then answered them \u2014 your present plan is slavery, which, on the remote prospect of a distant evil, we will not submit to. I would rather confederate with any single State, than submit to the Virginia plan. But we are already confede rated, and no power on earth can dissolve it but by the con sent of all the contracting powers \u2014 and four States, on this floor, have already declared their opposition to annihilate it. Is the old confederation dissolved, because some of the States wish a new confederation ?"], [186, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 180 Mr. Lansing. I move that the word not be struck out of the resolve, and then the question will stand on ils pro per ground \u2014 and the resolution will read thus : that the rep resentation of the first branch be according to the articles of the confederation; and the sense of the convention on this point will determine the question of a federal or na tional government. Mr. Madison. I am against the motion. I confess the necessity of harmonizing, and if it could be shown that the system is unjust or unsafe, I would be against it. There has been much fallacy in the arguments ad vanced by the gentleman from Maryland. He has, without adverting to many manifest distinctions, considered con federacies and treaties as standing on the same basis. In the one, the powers act collectively, in the other individ ually. Suppose, for example, that France, Spain, and some of the smaller States in Europe, should treat on war or peace, or on any other general concern, it would be done on principles of equality ; but if they were to form a plan of general government, would they give, or are the greater States obliged to give, to the lesser, the same and equal legislative powers? Surely not. They might differ on this point, but no one can say that the large states were wrong in refusing this concession. Nor can the' gentle man's reasoning apply to the present powers of congress ; for they may and do, in some cases, affect property, and in case of war, the lives of the citizens. Can any of the les ser States be endangered by an adequate representation ? Where is the probability of a combination ? What the in ducements? Where is the similarity of customs, manners, or religion? If there possibly can be a diversity of inter est, it is the case of the three large States. Their situa tion is remote, their trade different. The staple of Mas sachusetts is fish, and the carrying trade \u2014 of Pennsyl vania, wheat and flour \u2014 of Virginia, tobacco. Can States thus situated in trade, ever form such a combina-"], [187, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 181 tion? Do we find those combinations in the larger coun ties in the different State governments lo produce rival ships ? Does not the history of the nations of the earth verify it? Rome rivalled Carthage, and could not be satisfied before she was destroyed. The houses of Austria and Bouibon acted on the same view \u2014 and the wars of France and England have been waged through rivalship; and let me add, that we, in a great measure, owe our independency to those national contending pas sions. France, through this motive, joined us. She might, perhaps, with less expense, have induced England to divide America between them. In Greece the conten tion was ever between the larger states. Sparta against Athens \u2014 and these again, occasionally, against Thebes, were ready to devour each other. Germany presents the same prospect \u2014 Prussia against Austria. Do the greater provinces in Holland endanger the liberties of the lesser? And let me remark, that the weaker you make your confederation, the greater the danger to the lesser States. They can only be protected by a strong federal government. Those gentlemen who oppose the Virginia plan do not sufficiently analyze the subject. Their remarks, in general, are vague and inconclu sive. Captain Dayton. On the discussion of this question the fate of the State governments depend. Mr. Williamson. If any argument will admit of de monstration, it is that which declares, that all men have an equal right in society. Against this position, I have heard, as yet, no argument, and I could wish to hear what could be said against it. What is tyran ny ? Representatives of representatives, if you give them the power of taxation. From equals take equals, and the remainder is equal. What process is to annihilate smaller States, I know not. But I know it must be ty ranny if the smaller States can tax the greater, in order"], [188, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 182 to ease themselves. A general government cannot exer cise direct taxation. Money must be raised by duties and imposts, &c, and this will operate equally. It is im possible to tax according to numbers. Can a man over the mountains, where produce is a drug, pay equal with one near the shore ? Mr. Wilson. I should be glad to hear the gentleman from Maryland explain himself upon the remark of Old Sarum, when compared with the city of London. This he has allowed to be an unjust proportion ; as in the one place one man sends two members, and in the other one million are represented by four members. I would be glad to hear how he applies this to the larger and smaller States in Ame rica ; and whether the borough, as a borough, is repre sented, or the people of the borough. Mr. Martin rose to explain. Individuals, as composing a part of the whole of one consolidated government, are there represented. The further consideration of the question was post poned. Mr. Sherman. In society, the poor are equal to the rich in voting, although one pays more than the other. This arises from an equal distribution of liberty amongst all ranks ; and it is, on the same grounds, secured to the States in the confederation \u2014 for this would not even trust the important powers to a majority of the States. Con gress has too many checks, and their powers are too limited. A gentleman from New York thinks a limited monarchy the best government, and no State, distinctions. The plan now before us gives the power to four States to govern nine States. As they will have the purse, they may raise troops, and can also make a king when they please. Mr. Madison. There is danger in tho idea of the gentleman from Connecticut. Unjust repi cremation will ever produce it. In the United Nethei lands, Holland"], [189, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 183 governs the whole, although she has only one vote. The counties in Virginia are exceedingly disproportionate, and yet the smaller has an equal vote with the greater, and no inconvenience arises. Governor Franklin read some remarks, acknowledg ing the difficulties of the present subject. Neither an cient or modern history, (said Gov. Franklin,) can give us light. As a sparrow does not fall without Divine per mission, can we suppose that governments can be erected without his will ? We shall, I am afraid, be disgraced through little party views. I move that we have prayers every morning. Adjourned till to-morrow morning. FRIDAY, JUNE 29th, 1787. Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Dr. Johnson. As the debates have hitherto been man aged, they may be spun out to an endless length ; and as gentlemen argue on different grounds, they are equally conclusive on the points they advance, but afford no de monstration either way. States are political societies. \u2014 For whom are we to form a government ? for the people of America, or for those societies ? Undoubtedly for the latter. They must, therefore, have a voice in the second branch of the general government, if you mean to pre serve their existence. The people already compose the first branch. This mixture is proper and necessary \u2014 For we cannot form a general government on any other ground. Mr. Gorham. I perceive no difficulty in supposing a union of interest in the different States. Massachusetts formerly consisted of three distinct provinces \u2014 they have been united into one, and we do not find the least trace of party distinctions arising from their former separa tion. Thus it is that the interest of the smallar States will unite in a general government. It is thus they will"], [190, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 184 be supported. Jersey, in particular, situated between Philadelphia and New York, can never become a com mercial Stale. It would be her interest to be divided, and part annexed to New York and part to Pennsylva nia \u2014 or otherwise the whole to the general government. \u2014 Massachusetts cannot long remain a large State. The province of Maine must soon become independent of her. Pennsylvania can never become a dangerous State \u2014 her western country must, at some period, become separated from her, and consequently her power will be diminished. If some States will not confederate on a new plan, I will remain here, if only one State will consent to confederate with us. Judge Elsworth. I do not despair but that we shall be so fortunate as to devise and adopt some good plan of government. Judge Read. I would have no objection, if the govern ment was more national \u2014 but the proposed plan is so great a mixture of both, that it is best to drop it altogether. \u2014 A State government is incompatable with a general govern ment. If it was more national, I would be for a repre sentation proportionate to population. The plan of the gentleman from New Y'ork is certainly the best \u2014 but the great evil is the unjust appropriation of the public lands. If there was but one national government, we would be all equally interested. Mr. Madison. Some gentlemen are afraid that the plan is not sufficiently national, while others apprehend that it is too much so. If this point of representation was once well fixed, we would come nearer to one another in sentiment. The necessity would then be discovered of circumscribing more effectually the State governments, and enlarging the bounds of the general government. Some contend that States are sovereign, when, in fact, they are only political societies. There is a gradation of power in all societies, from the lowest corporation to the"], [191, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 185 highest sovereign. The States never possessed the es sential rights of sovereignty. These were always vest ed in congress. Their voting, as States, in congress, is no evidence of sovereignty. The State of Maryland vot ed by counties \u2014 did this make the counties sovereign? The States, at present, are only groat corporations, hav ing the power of making by-laws, and theso are effectu al only if they are not contradictory to the general con federation. The States ought to be placed under the control of the general government \u2014 at least as much so as they formerly were under the king and British par liament. The arguments, I observe, have taken a dif ferent turn, and I hope may tend to convince all of the necessity of a strong energetic government, which would equally tend to give energy to, and protect the State gov ernments. What was the origin of the military establish ments of Europe ? It was the jealousy which one State or kingdom entertained of another. This jealousy was ever productive of evil. In Rome the patricians were often obliged to excite a foreign war to divert the attention of the plebeians siom encroaching on the senatorial rights. \u2014 In England and France, perhaps this jealousy may give energy to their governments, and contribute to their ex istence. But a state of danger is like a state of war, and it unites the various parts of the government to exerlion. May not our distractions, however, invite danger from abroad ? If the power is not immediately derived from the people, in proportion to their numbers, we may make a paper confederacy, but that will be all. We know the ef- fects of the old confederation, and without a general govern- ment this will be like the former. Mr. Hamilton. The course of my experience in hu man affairs might perhaps restrain me from saying much on this subject. I shall, however, give birth to some of the observations I have made during the course of this debate. The gentleman from Maryland has been Y"], [192, "186 SECRET PROCEEDINGS at great pains to establish positions which are not denied. Many of ihera, as drawn from the best writers on gov- ernment, are become almost self-evident principles. \u2014 But I doubt the propriety of his application of those principles in the present discussion. He deduces from them the necessity that States entering into a confed- eracy must retain the equality of votes \u2014 this position cannot be correct \u2014 Facts plainly contradict it. The parliament of Great Britain asserted a supremacy over the whole empire, and the celebrated Judge Blackstone labors for the legality of it, although many parts were not represented. This parliamentary power we opposed as contrary to our colonial rights. With that exception, throughout that whole empire, it is submitted to. May not the smaller and greater States so modify their respective rights as to establish the geneial interest of the whole, without adhering to the right of equality ? Strict repre- sentation is not observed in any of the State govern- ments. The senate of New York are chosen by persons of certain qualifications, to the exclusion of others. The question, after all is, is it our interest in modifying this general government to sacrifice individual rights to the preservation of the rights of an artificial being, called States ? There can be no truer principle than this \u2014 that every individual of the community at large has an equal right to the protection of government. If therefore three States contain a majority of the inhabitants of America, ought they to be governed by a minority ? Would the in- habitants of the great Slates ever submit to this? If the smaller States maintain this principle, through a love of power, will not the larger, from the same motives, be equally tenacious to preserve their power? They are to surrender their rights \u2014 for what? for the preservation of an artificial being. We propose a free government \u2014 Can it be so if partial distinctions are maintained ? I agree with the gentleman from Delaware, that if the State go-"], [193, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 187 vernments are to act in the general government, it affords the strongest reason for exclusion. In the State of New- York, five counties form a majority of representatives, and yet the government is in no danger, because the laws have a genaral operation. The small States exag gerate their danger, and on this ground conlend for an undue proporlion of power. But their danger is increas ed, if the larger States will not submit to it. Where will they form new alliances for their support ? Will they do this with foreign powers? Foreigners are jealous of our increasing greatness, and would rejoice in our distrac tions. Those who have had opportunities of conversing with foreigners respecting sovereigns in Europe, have discovered in them an anxiety for the preservation of our democratic governments, probably for no other reason, but to keep us weak. Unless your government is res pectable, foreigners will invade your rights ; and to maintain tranquillity it must be respectable \u2014 even to ob serve neutrality you must have a strong government. \u2014 I confess our present situation is critical. We have just finished a war which has established our independency, and loaded us with a heavy debt. We have still every motive to unite for our common defence \u2014 Our people are disposed to have a good government, but this dispositon may not always prevail. It is difficult to amend confede rations \u2014 it has been attempted in vain, and it is perhaps a miracle that we are now met \u2014 We must therefore im prove the opportunity, and render the present system as perfect as possible. Their good sense, and above all, the necessity of their affairs, will induce the people to adopt it. Mr. Pierce. The great difficulty in congress arose from the mode of voting. Members spoke on the floor as State advocates, and were biassed by local advantages. \u2014 What is federal ? No more than a compact between States ; and the one heretofore formed is insufficient. We are"], [194, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 188 now met to remedy its defects, and our difficulties are great, but not, I hope, insurmountable. State distinc tions must be sacrificed so far as the general government shall render it necessar}- \u2014 without, however, destroying them altogether. Although I am here as a representa tive from a small State, I consider myself as a citizen of the United States, whose general interest I will always support. Mr. Gerry. It appears to me that the States never were independent \u2014 they had only corporate rights. Con federations are a mongrel kind of government, and the world does not afford a precedent to go by. Aristocracy is the worst kind of government, and I would sooner sub mit to a monarchy. We must have a system that will ex ecute itself. The question was then put on Mr. Lansing's motion, and lost \u2014 4 ayes \u2014 6 noes \u2014 one State divided. Question on the clause \u2014 6 ayes \u2014 4 noes \u2014 and one State divided. Judge Elsworth. I move that the consideration of tho 8th resolve be postponed. Carried \u2014 9 ayes \u2014 2 noes. I now move the following amendment to ihe resolve \u2014 that in the second branch each State have an equal vote. I confess lhat the effect of this motion is, to make the gene ral government partly federal and partly national. This will secure tranquility, and still make it efficient ; and it will meet the objections of the larger States. In taxes they will have a proportional weight in the first branch of the general legislature \u2014 If the great States refuse this plan, we will be forever separated. Even in the execu tive the larger States have ever had great influence. \u2014 The provinces of Holland ever had it. If all the States are to exist they must necessarily have an equal vote in the general government. Small communities when asso ciating with greater, can only be supported by an equal ity of votes. I have always found in my reading and"], [195, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. l8\u00bb \u25a0experience, that in all societies the governors are ever gra dually rising into power. The larger States, although they may not have a com mon interest for combination, yet they may be partially attache^to each other for mutual support and advance ment. This can be more easily effected than the union of the remaining small States to check it; and ought we not to regard antecedent plighted faith to the confedera tion already entered into, and by the terms of it declared to be perpetual? And it is not yet obvious to me that the States will depart from this ground. When in the hour of common danger we united as equals, shall it now be urged by some that we must depart from this principle when the danger is over? Will the world say that this is just? We then associated as free and independent States, and were well satisfied \u2014 To perpetuate that indepen dence, I wish to establish a national legislature, executive, and judiciary, for under these we shall I doubt not pre serve peace and harmony \u2014 nor should I be surprised (al though we made the general government the most per fect in our opinion,) that it should hereafter require amend ment \u2014 But at present this is as far as I possibly can go \u2014 If this convention only chalk out lines of a good government we shall do well. Mr. Baldwin. It appears to be agreed that the govern ment we should adopt ought to be energetic and formidable, yet I would guard against the danger of becoming too formidable. The second branch ought not to be elected as the first. Suppose we take the example of ihe constitu tion of Massachusetts, as it is commended for its goodness: There the first branch represents the people, and the se cond its property. Mr. Madison. I would always exclude inconsistent principles in framing a system of government. The dif ficulty of getting its defects amended are great, and some times insurmountable. The Virginia State government"], [196, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 190 Was the first which was made, and though its defects are evident to every person, we cannot get it amended. The Dutch have made four several attempts to amend their system without success. The few alterations nu^e in it were by tumult and faction, and for the worse. If there Was real danger, I would give the smaller States the defen sive weapons \u2014 But there is none from that quarter. The great danger to our general government is the great southern and northern interests of the continent, being opposed to each other. Look to the votes in congress, and most of them stand divided by the geography of the country, not according to the size of the States. Suppose ihe first branch granted money, may not the se cond branch, from State views, counteract the first? In congress, ihe single State of Delaware prevented an em bargo, at the time that all the other States thought it abso lutely necessary for the support of the army. Other powers, and those very essential, besides the legislative, will be given to the second branch \u2014 such as the negativing all State laws. I would compromise on this question, if I could do it on correct principles, but otherwise not \u2014 if the old fabric of the confederation must be the ground-work of the new, we must fail. Adjourned till to-morrow morning. SATURDAY, JUNE SOth, 1787. Met pursuant to adjournment. Present 11 States. Judge Brearsly moved that the president be directed to write to the executive of New Hampshire, requesting the attendance of its delegates. Negatived \u2014 2 ayes \u2014 5 noes \u2014 one State divided. The discussion of yesterday resumed. Mr. Wilson. The question now before us is of so much consequence, that I cannot give it a silent vote \u2014 Gentle wen have said, that if this amendment is not agreed to. separation to the north of Pennsylvania may be"], [197, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 191 the consequence. \u2014 This neither staggers me in my senti ments or my duty. If a minority should refuse their as sent to the new plan of a general government, and if they will have their own will, and without it, separate the union, let it be done ; but we shall stand supported by stronger and better principles. The opposition to this plan is as 22 is to 90, in the general scale \u2014 not quite a fourth part of the union \u2014 Shall three-fourths of the union surrender their rights for the support of that artificial being, cal led State interest ? If we must join issue I am willing. \u2014 - I cannot consent that one-fourth shall controul the power of three-fourths. If the motion is adopted, seven States will controul tho whole, and the lesser seven compose 24 out of 90. Ono third must controul two-thirds \u2014 21 overrule 66. For whom do we form a conslitution, for men, or for imagin ary beings called States, a mere metaphysical distinction . Will a regard to State rights justify the sacrifice of tho rights of men ? If we proceed on *3ny other foundation than the last, our building will neither be solid nor last ing. Weight and numbers is the only true principle\u2014 every other is local, confined or imaginary. Much has been said of ihe danger of the three larger States combin ing together to give rise to monarchy, or an aristocracy. Let the probability of this combination ba explained, and it will be found that a rivalship rather than a confed eracy will exist among them. Is there a single point in which this interest coincides? Supposing that the execu tive should be selected from one of the larger States, can the other two be gratified ? Will not this be a source of jealousy amongst them, and will they not separately court the interest of the smaller States, to counteract the views of a favorite rival ? How can an aristocracy arise from this combination more than amongst the small er States? On the contrary, the present claims of the smaller States lead directly to the establishment of an ar\u00bb"], [198, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 192 istocracy, which is the government of the few over the many, and the Connecticut proposal removes only a small part of the objection. There are only two kinds of bad governments \u2014 the one which does loo much, and therefore oppressive, and the other which does too little, and therefore weak. Congress partakes of the latter. and the motion will leave us in the same situation and as much fettered as ever we were. The people see its weak ness, and would be mortified in seeing our inability to correct it. The gentleman from Georgia has his doubts bow to vote on this question, and wishes some qualification of it to be made \u2014 I admit there ought to be some difference as to the numbers in the second branch ; and perhaps there are other distinctions which could, with propriety, be introduced \u2014 such, for example, as the qualifications of the elected, &c. However, if there are leading principles in the system which we adopt, much may be done in the detail. We all aim at giving the general government more energy. The State governments are necessary and valua ble \u2014 No liberty can be obtained without them. On this question depends the essential rights of the general gov ernment and of the people. Judge Elsworth. I have the greatest respect for the gentleman who spoke last. I respect his abilities, al though I differ from him on many points \u2014 He asserts that the general government must depend on the equal suffrage of the people. But will not this put it in the pow er of few States to controul the rest ? It is a novel thing in politics that the few controul the many. In the British government, the .few, as a guard, have an equal share in the government. The house of lords, although few in number, and sitting in their own right, have an equal share in their legislature. They cannot give away the property of the community, but they can prevent the eommons from being too lavish in their gifts. Where is"], [199, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 193 or was a confederation ever formed, where equality of voices was not a fundamental principle ? Mankind are apt to go from one extreme to another, and because we have found defects in the confederation, must we there fore pull down the whole fabric, foundation and all, in order to erect a new building totally different from it, without retaining any of its materials? What are its de fects? It is said equality of votes has embarrassed us; but how? Would the real evils of our situation have been cured, had not this been the case ? Would the proposed amendment in the Virginia plan, as to representation, have relieved us? I fancy not. Rhode Island has been often quoted as a small State, and by its refusal once de feated the grant of the impost. Whether she was right in so doing is not the question ; but was it a federal requisi tion? And if it was not, she did not, in this instance, defeat a federal measure. If the larger States seek security, they have it fully in the first branch of the general government. But can we turn the tables and say that the lesser States are equally secure ? In commercial regulations they will unite. If policy should require free ports, they would be found at Boston, Philadelphia, and Alexandria. In the dis position of lucrative offices they would unite. But I ask no surrender of any of the rights of the great States, nor do I plead duress in the makers of the old confedera tion, nor suppose they soothed the danger, in order to resume their rights when the danger was over. No ; small States must possess the power of self-defence or be ru ined. Will any one say there is no diversity of interests in the States ? And if there is, should not those interests be guarded and secured? But if there is none, then the large States have nothing to apprehend from an equality of rights. And let it be remembered, that these re marks are not the result of partial or local views. The Z"], [200, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 194 State I represent is respectable, and in importance holds a middle rank. Mr. Madison. Notwithstanding the admirable and close reasoning of the gentleman who spoke last, I am not yet convinced that my former remarks are not well founded. I apprehend he is mistaken as to the fact on which he builds one of his arguments. He supposes that equality of votes is the principle on which all confed eracies are formed \u2014 that of Lycia, so justly applauded by the celebrated Montesquieu, was different. He also ap peals to our good faith for the observance of the confede racy. We know we have found one inadequale to the purposes for which it was made \u2014 Why then adhere to a system which is proved to be so remarkably defective ? I have impeached a number of States for the .infraction of the confederation, and I have not even spared my own State, nor can I justly spare his. Did not Connecticut re fuse her compliance to a federal requisition? Has she paid, for the two last years, any money into the continental trea sury ? And does this look like government, or the obser vance of a solemn compact? Experience shows that the confederation is radically defective, and we must, in a new national government, guard against those defects. Although the large States in the first branch have a weight proportion ate to their population, yet as the smaller States have an equal vote in the second branch, they will be able to con troul and leave the larger without any essential benefit. As peculiar powers are intended to be granted to the second branch, such as the negativing State laws, &c, unless the larger States have a proportionate weight in the representa tion, they cannot be more secure. Judge Elsworth. My State has always been strictly federal, and I can with confidence appeal to your excel lency [ihe president] for the truth of it, during the war. The muster-rolls will show that she had more troops in"], [201, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 19S the field than even the State of Virginia. We strained every nerve to raise them ; and we neither spared money or exertions to complete our quotas. This extraordina ry exertion has greatly distressed and impoverished us, and it has accumulated our State debts \u2014 We feel the ef fects of it even to this day. But we defy any gentleman to show that we ever refused a federal requisition. We are constantly exerting ourselves to draw money from the pockets of our citizens, as fast as it comes in ; and it is the ardent wish of the State to strengthen the federal government. If she has proved delinquent through inabili ty only, it is not more than others have been, without the same excuse. Mr. Sherman. I acknowledge there have been fail ures in complying with the federal requisition. Many States have been defective, and the object of our convention is to amend these defects. Col. Davie. I have great objection to the Virginia plan as to the manner the second branch is to be formed. It is impracticable. The number may, in time, amount to two or three hundred. This body is too large for the purposes for which, we intend to constitute it. I shall vote for the amendment. Some intend a compromise. \u2014 This has been hinted by a member from Pennsylvania, but it still has its difficulties. The members will have their local prejudices. The preservation of the State soci eties must be the object of the general government. It has been asserted that we were one in war, and one in peace. Such we were as States ; but every treaty must be the law of the land as it affects individuals. The formation of the second branch, as it is intended by the motion, is also objectionable. We are going the same round with the old confederation \u2014 No plan yet presents sufficient checks to a tumultuary assembly, and there is none therefore which yet satisfies me. __. , Mr. Wilson. On the present motion it was not proper"], [202, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 196 to propose another plan. I think the second branch ought not to be numerous. I will propose an expedient \u2014 Let there be one member for every 100,000 souls, and the smallest States not less than one member each. This would give about twenty-six members. I make this propo sal not because I belong to a large State, but in order to pull down a rotten house, and lay a foundation for a new building. To give additional weight to an old building is to hasten its ruin. Governor Franklin. The smaller States, by this motion, would have the power of giving away the money of the greater States. There ought to be some difference be tween the first and second branches. Many expedients have been proposed, and I am sorry to remark, without effect. A joiner, when he wants to fit two boards, takes off with his plane the uneven parts from each side, and thus they fit. Let us do the same \u2014 we are all met to do something. I shall propose an expedient : Let the senate be elected by the States equally \u2014 in all acts of sovereignty and au thority, let the votes be equally taken \u2014 the same in the appointment of all officers, and salaries ; but in passing of laws, each State shall have a right of sjffrage in propor tion to the sums they respectively contribute. Amongst merchants, where a ship has many owners, her destination is determined in that proportion. I have been one of the ministers to France from this country during the war, and we should have been very glad, if they would have permitted us a vote in the distribution of the money to car ry on the war. Mr. Martin. Mr. Wilson's motion or plan would amount to nearly the same kind of inequality. Mr. King. The Connecticut motion contains all tho vices of the old confederation. It supposes an imagina- ry evil \u2014 the slavery of State governments. And should"], [203, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION 197 this convention adopt the motion, our business here is at an end. Captain Dayton. Declamation has been substituted for argument. Have gentlemen shown, or must we believe it, because it is said, that one of the evils of the old confedera tion was unequal representation? We, as distinct societies, entered into the compact. Will you now undermine the thirteen pillars that support it? Mr. Marlin. If we cannot confederate on just principles, I will never confederate in any other manner. Mr. Madison. I will not answer for supporting chimeri cal objects \u2014 but has experience evinced any good in the old confederation ? I know it never can answer, and I have therefore made use of bold language against it. I do assert, that a national senate, elected and paid by the people, will have no more efficiency than congress ; for the States will usurp the general government. I mean, however, to preserve the Stale rights with the same care as I would trials by jury ; and I am willing to go as far as my honora ble colleague. Mr. Bedford. That all the States at present are equal- ly sovereign and independent, has been asserted from every quarter of this house. Our deliberations here are e confirmation of the position ; and I may add to it, that each of them act from interested, and many from ambi- tious motives. Look at the votes which have been given on the floor of this house, and it will be found that their numbers, wealth, and local views, have actuated their determinations; and that the larger States proceed 'as if our eyes were already perfectly blinded. Impar- tiality, with them, is already out of the question \u2014 the reported plan is their political creed, and they support it, right or wrong. Even the diminutive State of Georgia has an eye to her future -wealth and greatness \u2014 South Carolina, puffed up with the possession of her wealth and negroes, and North Carolina, are all, from different"], [204, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 198 views, united with the great States. And these latter, al- though it is said they can never, from interested views, form a coalition, we find closely united in one scheme of interest and ambition, notwithstanding they endeavor to amuse us with the purity of their principles and the rec- titude of their intentions, in asserting that the general government must be drawn from an equal representation of the people. Pretences to support ambition are never wanting. Their cry is, where is the danger ? and they in- sist that although the powers of the general government will be increased, yet it will be for the good of the whole ; and although the three great States form nearly a majori- ty of the people of America, they never will hurt or in jure ihe lesser States. J do not, gentlemen, trust you. If you possess the power, the abuse of it could not be check- ed ; and what then would prevent you from exercising it to our destruction ? You gravely allege that there is no danger of combination, and triumphantly ask, how could combinations be effected? \"The larger States,\" you say, \" all differ in productions and commerce ; and ex- \" perience shows, that instead of combinations, they \" would be rivals, and counteract the views of one ano- \"ther.\" This, I repeat, is language calculated only to amuse us. Yes, sir, the larger States will be rivals, but not against each other \u2014 they will be rivals against the rest of the States. But it is urged that such a government would suit the people, and that ils principles are equita ble and just. How often has this argument been re futed, when applied to a federal government. The small States never can agree to ihe Virginia plan ; and why ' then is it still urged ? But it is said that it is not expect ed that the State governments will approve the proposed system, and that this house must directly carry it to the people for their approbation ! Is it come to this, then, that the sword must decide this controversy, and that the horrors of war must be added to the rest of our"], [205, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 199 misfortunes ? But what have the people already said ? \" We find the confederation defective \u2014 go, and give ad ditional powers to the confederation \u2014 give to it the \" imposts, regulation of trade, power to collect tax \" es, and the means to discharge our foreign and domes \" tic debts.\" Can we not then, as their delegates, agree upon these points ? As their ambassadors, can we not clearly grant those powers? Why then, when we ara met, must entire, distinct, and new grounds be taken, and a government, of which the people had no idea, be in stituted ? And are we to be told, if we wont agree to it, it is the last moment of our deliberations? I say, it is indeed the last moment, if we do agree to this assump tion of power. The States will never again be entrapped into a measure like this. The people will say the small States would confederate, and grant further powers to congress ; but 3'ou, the large States, would not. Then the fault will be yours, and all the nations of the earth will justify us. But what is to become of our public debts if we dissolve the union ? Where is your plighted faith ? Will you crush the smaller States, or must they be left unmolested? Sooner than be ruined, there are fo reign powers who ivill take us by the hand. I say not this to threaten or intimidate, but that we should reflect seriously before we act. If we once leave this floor, and solemnly renounce your new project, what will be the consequence ? You will annihilate your federal govern ment, and ruin must stare you in the face. Let us then do what is in our power \u2014 amend and enlarge the confede ration, but not alter the federal system. The people ex pect this, and no more. We all agree in the necessity of a more efficient government \u2014 and cannot this be done ? Although my State is small, I know and respect its rights, as much, at least, as those who have the honor to repre sent any of the larger States."], [206, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 200 Judge Elsworth. I am asked by my honorable friend from Massachusetts, whether by entering into a national government, I will not equally participate in national security ? I confess I should ; but I want domestic happi ness, as well as general security. A general government will never grant me this, as it cannot know my wants or relieve my distress. My State is only as one out of thir teen. Can they, the general government, gratify my wishes ? My happiness depends as much on the exist ence of my State government, as a new-born infant de pends upon its mother for nourishment. If this is not an answer, I have no other to give. Mr. King. I am in sentiment with those who wish the preservation of State governments ; but the general government may be so constituted as to effect it. Let the constitution we are about forming be considered as a commission under which the general government shall act, and as such it will be the guardian of the State rights. The rights of Scotland are secure from all danger and encroachments, although in the parliament she has a small representation. May not this be done in our gen eral government? Since I am up, I am concerned for what fell from the gentleman from Delaware \u2014 \" Take a foreign power by the hand!\" I am sorry he mentioned it, and I hope he is able to excuse it to himself on the score of passion. Whatever may be my distress, I never will court a foreign power to assist in relieving myself from it. Adjourned till Monday next. MONDAY, JULY 2d, 1787. Met pursuant to adjournment.

So the question, as to the amendment was lost."], [207, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 201 Mr. Pinkney. As a professional man, I might say, that there is no weight in the argument adduced in favor of the motion on which we were divided ; but candor obliges me to own, that equality of suffrage in the States is wrong. Prejudices will prevail, and they have an equal weight in the larger as in the smaller States. There is a solid dis tinction as to interest between the southern and northern States \u2014 To destroy the ill effects thereof, I renew the mo tion which I made in the early stage of this business. [See the plan of it before mentioned. General Pinkney moved for a select committee, to take into consideration both branches of the legislature. Mr. Martin. It is again attempted lo compromise. \u2014 \\rou must give each State an equal suffrage, or our business is at an end. Mr. Sherman. It seems we have got to a point, lhat we cannot move one way or the other. Such a committee is necessary to set us right. Mr. Morris. The two branches, so equally poised, can not have their due weight. It is confessed^ on all hands, that the second branch ought to be a check on the first \u2014 for without its having this effect it is perfectly useless. \u2014 The first branch, originating from the people, will ever be subject to precipitancy, changeability, and excess. Ex perience evinces the truth of this remark without having recourse to reading. This can only be checked by ability and virtue in the second branch. On your present system, can you suppose that one branch will possess it more than the others ? The second branch ought to be composed of men of great and established property \u2014 an aristocracy. Men, who from pride will support consistency and perma nency ; and to make them completely independent, they must be chosen for life, or they will be a useless body. Such an aristocratic body will keep down the turbulency of democracy. But if you elect them for a shorter period, they will be only a name, and we had better be without Aa"], [208, "SECRET PROCEEDINGS 202 them. Thus constiluted, I hope they will show u\u00ab the weight of aristocracy. History proves, I admit, that the men of large proper ty will uniformly endeavor to establish tyranny. How then shall we ward off this evil ? Give them the second branch, and you secure their weight for the public good. They become responsible for their conduct, and this lust of power will ever be checked by the democratic branch, and thus form a stability in your government. But if we continue changing our measures by the breath of democra cy, who will confide in our engagements? Who will trust us? Ask any person whether he reposes any confidence in the government of congress, or that of the State of Pennsyl vania \u2014 he will readily answer you, no. Ask him the rea son, and he will tell you, it is because he has no confidence in their stability. You intend also that the second branch shall be inca pable of holding any office in the general government. \u2014 It is a dangerous expedient. They ought to have every inducement to be interested in your government. De prive them of this right, and they will become inattentive to your welfare. The wealthy will ever exist ; and you never can be safe unless you gratify them as a body, in the pursuit of honor and profit. Prevent them by positive institutions, and they will proceed in some left-handed way. A son may want a place \u2014 you mean to prevent him from promotion \u2014 They are not to be paid for their services \u2014 they will in some way pay themselves ; nor is it in your power to prevent it. It is good policy that men of property be collected in one body, to give them one common influence in your government. Let vacan cies be filled up as they happen, by the executive. Be sides, it is of little consequence, on this plan, whether tho States are equally represented or not. If the State go vernments have the division of many of the loaves and fishes, and the general government few, it cannot exist."], [209, "OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 203 This senate would be one of the baubles of the general go vernment. If you choose them for seven years, whether chosen by tho people or the States ; whether by equal suffrage or in any other proportion, how will they be a check? They will still have local and State prejudices. \u2014 A government by compact is no government at all. You may as well go back to your congressional federal gov ernment, where, in the character of ambassadors, they may form treaties for each State. I avow myself the advocate of a strong government, still I admit that the influence of the rich must be guarded ; and a pure democracy is equally oppressive to the lower orders of the community. This remark is founded on the experience of history. We are a commercial people, and as such will be obliged to engage in European politics. Local government cannot apply to the general government. These latter remarks I throw out only for the consideration of the committee who are to be appointed. Gov. Randolph. I am in favor of appointing a com mittee ; but considering the warmth exhibited in debate on Saturday, I have, I confess, no great hopes that any good will arise from it. Cannot a remedy be devised? If there is danger to the lesser States, from an unequal representation in the second branch, may not a check be found in the appointment of one executive, by electing him by an equality of State votes ? He must have the right of interposing between the two branches, and this might give a reasonable security to the smaller States. \u2014 Not one of the lesser States can exist by itself; and a dis solution of the confederation, I confess, would produce conventions, as well in the larger as in the smaller States. The principle of self-preservation induces me to seek for a government that will be stable and secure. Mr. Strong moved to refer the 7th resolve to the same committee. Mr. Wilson.

The committee proceeded to consider in what manner they should discharge the business with which they were entrusted. By the proceedings in the convention they were so equally divided on the important question of re presentation in the two branches, that the idea of a conci liatory adjustment must have been in contemplation of the house in the appointment of this committee. But still how to effect this salutary purpose was the question. Many of the members, impressed with the utility of a gene ral government, connected with it the indispensable neces sity of a representation from the States according to their numbers and wealth ; while others, equally tenacious of the rights of the States, would admit of no other representation but such as was strictly federal, or in other words, equality of suffrage. This brought on a discussion of the principles on which tho house had divided, and in a lengthy recapitula tion of the arguments advanced in the house in support of these opposite propositions. As I had not openly explain- ed my sentiments on any former occasion on this question, but constantly in giving my vote, showed my attachment to the national government on federal principles, I took this occasion to explain my motives \u2014 [See a copy of my speech hereunto annexed.*] These remarks gave rise to a motion of Dr. Franklin, which after some modification was agreed to, and made the basis of the following report of the committee. The committee to whom was referred the eighth resolu tion, reported from the committee of the whole bouse, and * It is matter of regret tliat this document cannot be found : the princi ples it contained are perhaps rmbodied in Ihe letter from Mr. Yates and Mr, Lansing to Gov.

That all bills for raising or apportioning money, and for fixing salaries of the officers of government of the United States, shall originate in the first branch of the legislature, and shall not be altered or amended by the second branch ; and that no money shall be drawn from the public treasury, but in pursuance of appropriations to be originated in the first branch.

But I must confess I see nothing of con cession in it. The originating money bills is no concession on the part \u2022of the smaller States, for if seven States in the second branch should want such a bill, their interest in the first branch will prevail to bring it forward \u2014 It is nothing more than a nominal privilege. The second branch, small in number, and well con nected, will ever prevail. The power of regulating trade, imposts, treaties, &c. are more essential lo the communi ty than raising money, and no provision is made for those in the report \u2014 We are driven to an unhappy dilemma. Two thirds of the inhabitants of the union are to please the remaining one third by sacrificing their essential rights. When we satisfy the majority of the people in securing their rights, we have nothing to fear ; in any other way, every thing. The smaller States, I hope will at last see their true and real interest. \u2014 And I hope that the warmth of the gentleman from Delaware will never induce him to yield to his own suggestion of seeking for foreign aid.

Resolved, That provision ought to be made for the admission of States, lawfully arising within the limits of the United States, whether from a voluntary junction of government and territory, or otherwise, with the consent of a number of voices in the national legislature less than the whole. 11, Resolved, That a republican government, and tha territory of each State (except in the instance of a voluntary"], [218, "212 APPENDIX. junction of government and territory) ought to be guaran teed by the United States to each State. 12.

That after such publication, the electors should be appointed, and the sena tors and representatives elected. That the electors should meet on the day fixed for the election of the presi dent, and should transmit their votes, certified, signed, sealed, and directed, as the constitution requires, to the secretary of the United States, in congress assembled ; that the senators and representatives should convene at the time and place assigned ; that the senators should appoint a president of the senate, for the sole purpose of receiving, opening, and counting the votes for president ; and, that after he shall be chosen, the congress, together wi;h the president, should, without delay, proceed to execute this constitution.

IN CONVENTION, September 17, 1737- Sir, We have now ihe honor to submit to the consideration of the United States in congress assembled, that constitution which has appeared to us the most advisable. The friends of our country have long seen and desired, that the power of making war, peace, and treaties ; that of levying money and regulating commerce, and the cor- Ii"], [272, "266 APPENDIX. respondent execulive and judicial authorities should bo fully and effectually vested in the general government of the union ; but the impropriety of delegating such exten-r sive trusts to one body of men is evident. Hence results the necessity of a different organization, It is obviously impracticable, in the federal govern ment of these States, to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all ; individuals ehtering into society, must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest. The magni tude of the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and circumstance as -on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which must be surrendered, and those which may be reserved ; and on the present occasion this diffi culty was increased by a difference among the several States as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular interests. In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our view that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true American, the consolidation of our union, in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps our national existence. This important consideration, seri** ously and deeply impressed on our minds, led each State in the convention to be less rigid on points of inferior mag nitude, than might have been otherwise expected ; and thus the constitution, which we now present, is the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and conces sion which the peculiarity of our political situation render ed indispensable. That it will meet the full and entire appiobation of eve ry State is not perhaps to be expected ; but each will doubtless consider, that had her interests alone been con sulted, the coasequences might have been particularly dis agreeable or injurious to others; that it is liable to as few exceptions as could reasonably have been expected, we"], [273, "APPENDIX. 267 hope and believe ; that it may promote the lasting wel fare of that country so dear to us all, and secure her free dom and happiness, is our most ardent wish. With great respect, we have the honor to be, sir, your excellency's most obedient and humble servants, GEO. WASHINGTON, President.

ADVERTISEMENT, Published by the Department of State as an introduction to the Journal of the Convention assembled at Philadelphia Monday, May 12, and dissolr* ed Monday, September 17, 1787. The first volume of the late edition of the laws of tbs United States, compiled under the direction of the late sec\u00bb retary of State and attorney general, contains a succinct historical review of the successive public measures, which led to the present organization of the North American Union, fiom the assembling of the congress of the colonies on the 5th of September, 1774, to the adoption of the con\u00bb stitution of the United States, and of the subsequent amend* nifints to it, now in force. The following resolution of the old congress, adopted on the 21st of February, 1787, contains the authority by which the convention which formed the constitution, was convoked : \" Whereas there is provision in the articles of confed* \" eration and perpetual union, for making alterations \u2022'therein, by the assent of a congress of the United \" States, and of the legislatures of the several States ; \"and whereas experience hath evinced, that there are \" defects in the present confederation, as a mean to rem\u00ab \u00bb* edy which, several of the States, and particularly the"], [278, "APPENDIX. 272 \" State of New York, by express instructions to their del \" egates in congress, have suggested a convention for \"the purposes expressed in the following resolution; \" and such convention appearing to be the most probable \" mean of establishing in these States a firm national go \" vernment \u2014 \" Resolved, That in the opinion of congress, it is ex \" pedient, that on the second Monday in May next, a \" convention of delegates, who shall have been appointed \" by the several States, be held at Philadelphia, for the \" sole and express purpose of revising the articles of con \" federation, and reporting to congress and the several \" legislatures, such alterations and provisions therein, \" as shall, when agreed to in congress, and confirmed by \" the States, render the federal constitution adequate to \" the exigencies of government, and the preservation of \" the union.\" The day appointed by this resolution for the meeting of the convention was the second Monday in May ; but the 25th of that month was the first day upon which a sufficient number of members appeared to constitute a re presentation of a majority of the States. They then elec ted George Washington their president, and proceeded to business. On the 29th of May, Mr. Edmund Randolph presented to the convention fifteen resolutions, and Mr. C. Pinckney laid before them the draft of a federal government, which were referred to a committee of the whole ; which debated the resolutions, from day to day, until the 13th of June, when the committee of the whole reported to the conven tion a series of nineteen resolutions, founded upon those which had been proposed by Mr. Randolph. On the 15th of June, Mr. Patterson submitted to the convention his resolutions, which were referred to a com mittee of the whole, to whom were also re-committed the resolutions reported by them oa.the 13th."], [279, "APPENDIX. 273 On the 19th of June, the committee of the whole report ed, that they did not agree to Mr. Patterson's propositions, but reported again the resolutions which had been reported before. The convention never afterwards went into committee of the whole ; but from the l9th of June till the 23d of July were employed in debating the nineteen resolutions report ed by the committee of the whole on the 13th of June ; some of which were occasionally referred to grand commit tees, of one member from each State, or to select commit tees of five members. After passing upon the nineteen resolutions, it was, on the 23d of July, resolved, \" That the proceedings of the \" convention for the establishment of a national govem \" ment, except what respects the supreme executive, be re \" ferred to a committee for the purpose of reporting a con \"stitution conformably to the proceedings aforesaid.\" This committee, consisting of five members, and call ed in the journal \" the committee of detail,\" was appoint ed on the 24th of July, and with the proceedings of the convention, the propositions submitted to the convention, by Mr. Charles Pinckney, on the 29th of May, and by Mr. Patterson on the 15th of June, were referred to them. On the 26th of July, a resolution respecting the exe cutive and two others, offered for the consideration of the convention, were referred to the committee of detail; and the convention adjourned till Monday, the 6th of August, when the committee reported a constitution lor the estab lishment of a national government. This draft formed the general text of debate, from that time till the 8th of September ; many additional resolutions being in the course of the deliberations, proposed, and referred to and reported upon by the same committee of detail, or other committees of eleven, (a member from each State,) or of five. Kk"], [280, "APPENDIX. 274 On the 8th of September a committee of five was ap pointed \" to revise the style of, and arrange the articles \" agreed to by the house.\" On the 12th of September, this committee reported the constitution as revised and arranged, and the draft of a let ter to congress. It was ordered that printed copies of the reported constitution should be furnished to the members, and they were brought in the next day. On the seventeenth day of September, 1787, the con vention dissolved itself, by an adjournment without day, after transmitting the plan of constitution which they had prepared to congress, to be laid before conventions, delega ted by the people of the several States, for their assent and ratification. The last act of the convention was a resolution that their journal and other papers should be deposited with their president, to be retained by him subject to the order of the congress, if ever formed under the constitu tion. On. the 19th of March; 1796, president Washington deposited in the department of state three manuscript volumes ; one containing in 153 pages, the journal of the federal convention of 1787; one the journal of the proceedings of the same convention, while in committee of the whole, in 28 pages; and one, three pages of lists of yeas and nays, on various questions debated in the con vention ; and after an interval of eight blank pages, five other pages of like yeas and nays. There were also two loose sheets, and one half sheet of similar yeas and nays ; a printed draft of the constitution as reported on the 6th of August, 1787, with erasures and written interlinea tions of amendments afterwards adopted ; two sheets containing copies of the series of resolutions offered to the convention by Mr. Edmund Randolph, in different stages of amendment, as reported by the committee of"], [281, "APPENDIX. 275 the whole ; and seven other papers of no importance in re lation to the proceedings of the convention. The volume containing the journal of the convention was in an incomplete state. The journal of Friday, Sep tember 14, and a commencement of that of Saturday, Sep tember 15, filled three-fourths of the 153d page ; then ter minated abruptly, and were, with the exception of five lines, crossed out with a pen. President Madison, to whom ap plication for that purpose was made, has furnished, from his own minutes, the mean's of completing the journal, as now published. The yeas and nays were not inserted in the journals, but were entered partly in a separate volume, and part ly on loose sheets of paper. They were taken, not indi vidually, but by States. Instead of publishing them, as they appear in the manuscript, they are now given im mediately after each question upon which they were taken. Gen. Joseph Bloomfield, executor of David Brearley, one of the members of the convention, transmitted to the department of State several additional papers, which are included in this publication. The paper, purporting to be Col. Hamilton's plan of a constitution, is not noticed in the journals. It was not offered by him for discussion, but was read by him, as part of a speech, observing that he did not mean it as a proposition, but only to give a more correct view of his ideas. The return of the members in the several States, ap pears to have been an estimate used for tbe purpose of ap portioning the number of members to be admitted from each of the States to the house of representatives. In order to follow with clear understanding, the course of proceedings of the convention, particular attention is required to the following papers, which, except the"], [282, "276 APPENDIX. third, successively formed the general teit of their de bates. 1.

Twenty-three resolutions, adopted and ela- borated by the convention, in *\u00a7ebate upon the above nineteen reported from the commitlee of the whole ; and on the 23d and 26th of July, referred, together with the plan of Mr. C. Pinkney, and the propositions of Mr. Patterson, to a committee of five, to report a draft of a constitution. 4. August 6.

The second and fourth of these papers, are among those deposited by president Washington, at the department of State. The first, fourth and fifth, are among those transmitted by general Bloomfield. The third is collected from the proceedings of the con vention, as they are spread over the journal from June 19th to July 26th. This paper, together with the plan of Mr. C. Pinkney, a copy of which has been furnished by him, and the propo sitions of Mr. Patterson, included among the papers forwarded by general Bloomfield, comprise the materi als, upon which the first draft was made of the constitu-"], [283, "APPENDIX. 277 tion, as reported by the committee of detail, on the 6th of August. To the journal, acts, and proceedings of the convention, are added in this publication, the subsequent proceedings of the congress of the confederation, upon the constitution, reported as the result of their labors ; and the acts of ratifi cation by the conventions of the several States of union, by virtue of which it became the supreme law of the land ; and also the amendments to it, which have been since adopted and form a part of the constitulion. It was thought that this supplement would be, if not essential, at least well adapted to carry into full effect the intentions of congress in directing the publication ; by presenting at one view, the rise, progress, and present condition of the constitution of the United States.

Esquires, to the Governor of New York, containing their reasons for not subscribing to the Federal Constitution. Sir, We do ourselves the honor to advise your excellency, that in pursuance of concurrent resolutions of the hono rable senate and assembly, we have, together with Mr. Hamilton attended the convention, appointed for revising the articles of confederation, and reporting amendments to the same. It is with the sincerest concern we observe, that, in the prosecution of the important objects of our mission, we have been reduced to the disagreeable alternative, of either exceeding the powers delegated to us, and giving our assent to measures which we conceive destructive to the political happiness of the citizens of the United States, or opposing our opinians to that of a body of respectable men, to whom those citizens had given the most unequi vocal proofs of confidence. Thus circumstanced, under these impressions, to have hesitated, would have been to be culpable ; we, therefore, gave the principles of the constitution which has received the sanction of a majority of the convention, our decided and unreserved dissent; but we must candidly confess, that we should have been equally opposed to any system, however modified, which had in object the consolidation of the United States into one government. We beg leave, briefly, to state some cogent reasons, which,' among others, influenced us to decide against a consolidation of the States. These are reducible into two heads. 1st. The limited and well defined powers under which we acted, and which could not, on any possible construe-"], [287, "APPENDIX. 281 tion, embrace an idea of such magnitude, as to assent to general constitution, in subversion of that of the State. 2d. A conviction of ihe impracticability of establishing a general government, pervading every part of the United States, and extending essential benefits to all. Our powers were explicit, and confined to the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation, and reporting such alterations and provisions therein, as should render the federal constitution adequate to the ex igencies of government, and the preservation of the union. From ihese expressions, we were led to believe, that a system of consolidated government could not in the re motest degree, have been in contemplation of the legisla ture of this Stale 1 for that so important a trust, as tho adopting measures which tended to deprive the Slate gov ernment of its most essential rights of sovereignty, and to place it in a dependent situation, could not have been confided by implication ; and the circumstance, that the acts of the convention were to receive a State approbation in the last resort, forcibly corroborated the opinion, that our powers could not involve the subversion of a consti tution, which being immediately derived siom ihe people, could only be abolished by their express consent, and not by a legislature, possessing authority vested in them for its preservation. Nor could we suppose, that if it had been the intention of the legislature, to abrogate the ex isting confederalion, they would, in such pointed terms, have directed the attention of their delegates to the re vision and amendment of it, in total exclusion of every other idea. Reasoning in this manner, we were of opinion, that the leading feature of every amendment, ought to be the preservation of the individual States, in their uncontroul ed constitutional rights, and that in reserving these, a mode might have been devised of granting to the confed eracy, tho moneys arising from a general system of re- LI"], [288, "APPENDIX. 282 venue; the power of regulating commerce, and enforc ing the observance of foreign treaties, and other necessary matters of less moment. Exclusive of our objections originating from the want of power, we entertained an opinion, that a general gov ernment, however guarded by declarations of rights, or cautionary provisions, must unavoidably, in a short time, be productive of the destruction of the civil liberty of such citizens who could be effectually coerced by it: by reason of the extensive territory of the United Slates, the dispersed situation of its inhabitants, and the insu perable difficulty of controuling or counteracting the views, of a set of men (however unconstitutional and op pressive their acts might be) possessed of all the power's of government ; and who from their remoteness from their constituents and necessary permanency of office, could not be supposed to be uniformly actuated by an at tention to their welfare and happiness ; that however wise and energetic the principles of the general govern ment might be, the extremitie^pf the United States could not be kept in due submission and obedience to its laws, at the distance of many hundred miles from the seat of government ; that if the general legislature was compo sed of so numerous a body of men, as to represent the in terests of all the inhabitants of the United States, in tho usual and true ideas of representation, the expense of sup porting it would become intolerably burdensome ; and that if a few only were vested with a power of legislation, the interests of a great majority of the inhabitants of the United States, must necessarily be unknown ; or if known, even in the first stages of the operations of tho new government, unattended to. These reasons were, in our opinion, conclusive against any system of consolidated government j to that recom mended by the convention, we suppose most of them very forcibly apply."], [289, "APPENDIX. 283 It is not our intention to pursue this subject farther, than merely to explain our conduct in the dischargo of the trust which the honorable the legislature reposed in us. \u2014 Interested, however, as we are, in common with our fellow cilizens, in ihe result, we cannot forbear to declare, that we have the strongest apprehensions, that a government so organized, as that recommended by tho convention, cannot afford that security to equal and perma nent liberty, which we wished to make an invariable object of our pursuit. We were not present at the complelion of the new con stitution ; but before we left the convention, its principles were so well established, as to convince us, that no altera tion was to be expected to conform it to our ideas of expe diency and safety. A persuasion, that our further attend ance would be fruitless and unavailing, renderbd us less so licitous to return. We have thus explained our motives for opposing ihe adoption of the national constitution, which we conceived it our duty to communicate to your excellency, to be sub mitted to the consideration of the honorable legislature.

Richmond, Oct. 10, 17S7. Sir: The constitution, which I enclosed to the general as sembly in a late official letter, appears without my signa ture. This circumstance, although trivial in its own na ture, has been rendered rather important to myself at least, by being misunderstood by some, and misrepre sented by others. \u2014 As I disdain to conceal the reasons for withholding my subscription, I have always been, still am, and ever shall be, ready to proclaim them to the world. To the legislature, therefore, by whom I was deputed to the federal convention, I beg leave now to ad dress them; affecting no indifference to public opinion, but resolved not to court it by an unmanly sacrifice of my own judgment. As this explanation will involve a summary, but gener al review of our federal situation, you will pardon me, I trust, although I should transgress the usual bounds of a letter. Before my departure for the convention, I believed, that the confederation was not so eminently defective, as it had been supposed. But after I had entered into a free communication with those who were best informed of the condition and interest of each State ; afier I had compar- ed the intelligence derived from them, with the properties which ought to characterize the government of our union, I became persuaded, that the confederation was destitute of every energy, which a constitution of the United States ought to possess. For the objects proposed by its institution were, that it should be a shield against foreign hostility, and a firm resort against domestic commotion ; that it should cher-"], [291, "285 APPENDIX. ish trade, and promote the prosperity of the Slates UndM its care. But these are not among the attributes of our present union. Severe experience under tho pressure of war \u2014 a ruinous weakness manifested since the return of peace; and the contemplation of those dangers, which darken the future prospect, have condemned ihe hope of gran deur and of safety under the auspices of the confedera tion. In the exigencies of war, indeed, the history of its ef fects is but short ; the final ratification having been de layed until the beginning of the year 17S1. Butjiowever short, this peiiod is distinguished by meloncholly testi monies of its inability to maintain in harmony, the social intercourse of the States, to defend congress against en croachments on their rights, and to obtain by requi sitions, supplies to the federal treasury, or recruits to the federal armies. I shall not attempt an enumeration of the particular instances ; but leave to 3'our own remem brance and the records of congress, the support of the asser tions. In ihe season of peace too, not many years have elnps ed ; and yet each of them has produced fatal examples of delinquency, and sometimes of pointed opposition to federal duties. To the various remonstrances of con gress, I appeal, for a gloom}', but unexaggerated narra- tive of ihe injuries which our faith, honor and happiness, have sustained by the failure of the States. But these evils are past ; and some may be led by an honest zeal to conclude that they cannot be repeated. Yes, sir, they will be repeated as long as tho confederation exists, and will bring wilh them other mischiefs, spring ing from the same source, which cannot be yet foreseen in their full array of terror. If wo examine the constitution and laws of the several States, it is immediately discovered that tbe law of na-"], [292, "286 APPENDIX. lions is unpiovided with sanctions in many cases, which deeply affect public dignity and public justice. The let ter however of the confederation does not permit con gress to remedy these defects, and such an authority, al though evidently deducible from its spirit, cannot with out violation of the second article, be assumed. Is it not u political phenomenon, that the head of the confedera cy should be doomed to be plunged into war, from its wretched impotency to check offences against ibis law ; and sentenced to witness in unavailing anguish the in fraction of their engagements to foreign sovereigns! And yet this is not the only grevious point of weakness. After a war shall be inevitable, the requisitions of con gress for quotas of men or money, will again prove un productive, and fallacious. Two causes will always con spire to this baneful consequence. 1. No government can be stable, which hangs on hu man inclination alone, unbiassed by the coercion ; and 2, from the very connection between States bound to pro portionate contributions, jealousies and suspicions natur ally arise, which at least chill the ardor, if they do not excite the murmurs of the whole. I do not forget indeed, that by one sudden impulse ourpait of the American con tinent has been thrown into a military posture, and that in the eailier annals of the war, our armies marched to the field on the mere recommendations of congress. But ought we to argue from a contest, thus signalized by the magnitude of its stake, that as often as a flame shall be hereafter kindled, the same enthusiasm will fill our le gions, or renew them, as they may be filled by losses! If not, where shall we find protection? Impressions, like those, which prevent a compliance with requisitions of regular forces, will deprive the American republic of the services of militia. But let us suppose that they are attainable, and acknowledge as I always shall, that they are the natural support of a free government. When it"], [293, "APPENDIX. 287 is remembered, that in their absence agriculture must languish; lhat they are not habituated to military expo sures and the rigour of military discipline, and that the necessity of holding in readiness successive detachments, carries the expense far beyond that of enlistments \u2014 This resource ought lo be adopted with caution. As strongly too am I persuaded, that the requisitions for money will not be more cordially received- For be sides the distrust, which would prevail with respect to them also ; besides the opinion, entertained by each state of its own liberality and unsatisfied demands against tho United Slates, there is another consideration not less worthy of attention \u2014 the first rule for determining each quota of the value of all lands granted or surveyed, and of the buildings and improvements thereon. It is no longer doubted, lhat an equitable, uniform mode of estimaling that value, is impracticable ; and therefore twelve Slates have substituted the number of inhabitants under certain limitations, as the standard according to which money is to be furnished. But under the subsisting articles of the union, the assent of the thirteenth Stale is necessary, and has not yet been given. This does of itself lessen the hope of procuring a revenue for federal uses; and the miscarriage of the impost almost rivets our despon dency. Amidst these disappointments, it would afford some con solation, if when rebellion shall threaten any State, an ul timate asylum could be sound under the wing of congress. But it is at least equivocal whether they can intrude for ces into a State, rent asunder by civil discord, even with the purest solicitude for our federal welfare, and on the most urgent entreaties of the State itself. Nay the very allowance of this power would be pageantry alone, from the want of money and of men. To these defects of congressional power, the history of man has subjoined others, not lees alarming. I ear-"], [294, "APPENDIX. 288 neslly pray, that the recollection of common sufferings,, which terminated in common glory, may check the sal lies of violence, and perpetuate mutual friendship between the Slates. But I cannot presume, that we are superior to those unsocial passions, which under like circumstan ces have infested more ancient nations. I cannot pre sume, that through all time, in the daily mixture of Ame rican citizens wilh each olher, in the conflicts for com mercial advantages, in the discontenls which ihe neigh borhood of territory has been seen to engender in other quarters of ihe globe, and in the efforts of faction and in trigue \u2014 thirteen disiinct communities under no effective superintending control (as the United States confessedly now are, notwithstanding the bold terms of the confede ration) will avoid a haired to each other deep and deadly. In the prosecution of this enquiry, we shall find the geneial prosperity to decline under a system thus unnerv ed. No sooner is the merchant prepared for foreign ports, with the treasures which this new world kindly of fers to his acceptance, than it is announced to him, that they are shut against American shipping, or opened un der oppressive regulations. He urges congress to a counter-policy, and is answered only by a condolence on the general misfortune. He is immediately struck with the conviclion, that until exclusion shall be opposed to exclusion, and restriclion to restriction, the American flag will be disgraced. For who can conceive, that thirteen legislatures, viewing commerce under different regula tions, and fancying themselves discharged from every obligation to concede the smallest of their commercial ad vantages for the benefit of the whole, will be wrought in to a concert of action and defiance of every prejudice T Nor is this all : Let the great improvements be recount ed, which have enriched and illustrated Europe : Let it be noted, how few those are, which will be absolutely de nied to the United States, comprehending within their"], [295, "APPENDIX. 289 boundaries, the choicest blessings of climate, soil, and navi gable waters ; then let the most sanguine patriot banish, if ho can, the mortifying belief that all these must sleep, until they shall be roused by ihe vigor of a national go vernment. I have not exemplified the preceding remarks by mi nute details ; because they aie evidently fortified by truth, and the the consciousness of the United States of Ame rica. I shall, therefore, no longer deplore the unfitness of the confederation to secure our peace ; but proceed, with a truly unaffected distrust of my own opinions, to examine what order of powers the government of the United Stales ought to enjoy? How they ought to be de fended against encroachments? Whether they can be in terwoven in the confederation, without an alteration of its very essence, or must be lodged in new hands ? Show ing, at the same time, the convulsions, which seem to await us, from a dissolution of the union or partial confedera cies. To mark the kind and degree of authority which ought to be confided to the government of the United States, is no more than to reverse the description which I have alrea dy given, of the defects of the confederation. From thence it will follow, that the operations of peace and war will be clogged without regular advances of mo ney, and that these will be slow indeed, if dependent on supplication alone. For what better name do requisi tions deserve, which may be evaded or opposed without the fear of coercion ? Bui although coercion is an indispen sable ingredient, it ought not to be directed against a Stale, as a State; it being impossible to attempt it except by blockading the trade of the delinquent, or carrying war into its bowels. Even if these violent schemes were eli gible, in other respects, both of them might, perhaps, be defeated by the scantiness of the public chest ; would be tardy in their complete effect, as the expense of the land M m"], [296, "APPENDIX. ' 290 and naval equipmenls must be first reimbursed ; and might drive the proscribed State into the desperate re solve of inviting foreign alliances. Against each of them lie separate unconquerable objections. A blockade is not equally applicable to all the States, they being differ ently circumstanced in commerce and in ports; nay, an excommunication from the privilege of the union would be vain, because every regulalion or prohibition may be easily eluded under the rights of American citizenship, or of foreign nations, But how shall we speak of the in trusion of troops? Shall we arm citizens against citizens, and habituate them to shed kindred blood ? Shall we risk the inflicting of wounds which will generate a rancour never to be subdued? Would there be no room to fear, that an army accustomed to fight for the establish ment of authority, would salute an emperor of their own? Let us not bring these things into jeopardy. Let us rather substitute the same process by which individuals are com pelled to contribute to the government of their own States,. Instead of making requisitions to the legislatures, it would appear more proper that taxes should be imposed by the federal head, under due modifications and guards ; that the collectors should demand from the citizens their lespective quotas, and be supported as in the collection of ordinary taxes. It follows, too, that, as the general government will be responsible to foreign nations, it ought to be able to annul any offensive measure, or enforce any public right. Per haps among the topics on which they may be aggrieved or complain, the commercial intercourse, and the manner in which contracts are discharged, may constitute the principal articles of clamor. It follows, too, that the general government ought to be the supreme arbiter for adjusting every contention among the Stales. In all their connections, therefore, with each other, and particularly in commerce, which"], [297, "APPENDIX. 291 \\vill probably create the greatest discord, it ought to hold the reins. It follows too, that the general government ought to protect each State against domestic as well as external violence. And lastly, it follows, that through the general govern ment alone, can we ever assume ihe rank to which we are entitled by our resources and situation. Should the people of America surrender these powers, they can be paramount to the constitutions and ordinary acts of legislation, only by being delegated by them. I do not pretend to affirm, but I venture to believe, that if tho confederation had been solemnly questioned in opposition to our constitution, or even to one of our laws, posterior to it, it must have given way. For never did it obtain a higher ratification, than a resolution of assembly in the dai ly form. This will be one security against encroachment. But another not less effectual is, to exclude the individual States from any agency in the national government, as far as il may be safe, and their interposition may not be abso lutely necessary. But now, sir, permit me to declare, that in my humble judgment, the powers by which alone the blessings of a general government can be accomplished, cannot be inter woven in the confederation, without a change in its very essence, or, in other words, that the confederation must be thrown aside. This is almost demonstrable, from the inefficacy of requisitions, and from the necessity of converting them into acts of authority. My suffrage, as a citizen, is also for additional powers. But to whom shall we commit these acts of authority, these addi tional powers? To congress? Wften I formerly lament ed the defects in the jurisdiction of congress, I had no view to indicate any other opinion, than that the fede ral head ought not to be so circumscribed. For free as I"], [298, "APPENDIX. 292 am at all times to profess my reverence for that body, and tbe individuals who compose it, I am ye! equally free to make known my aversion to repose such a tiust in a tribunal so constituted. My objections are not the visions of theory, but the result of my own observations in Ame rica, and of the experience of, others -.broad. 1. The le gislative and executive are concentred in the same persons. This, where real power exists, must eventuate in tyranny. 2. The representaiion of the States bears no proportion to their importance. This is an unreasonable subjection of the will of the majority to that of the minority. 3. The mode of election, and the liability of being recalled, may too often render the delegates rather partizans of their own Stales than representatives of the union. 4. Cabal and intrigue must consequently gain an ascendency in a course of years. 5. A single house of legislation will sometimes be precipitate, perhaps passionate. 6. As long as seven States are required for the smallest, and nine for the greatest voles, may not foreign influence at some future day insinuate itself, so as to interrupt every active exertion? 7. To crown the whole, it is scarce within the verge of possibility, that so numerous an as sembly should acquire lhat secrecy, dispatch, and vig our, which are the test of excellence in the executive de partment. My inference from these facts and principles, is, that the new powers must be deposited in a new body, grow ing out of a consolidation of the union, as far as the cir cumstances of the States will allow. Perhaps, however, some may mediate its dissolution, and others, partial con federacies. The first is an idea awful indeed, and irreconcilable with a very early, and hitherto uniform conviction, that without union, we must be undone. For, before the voice of war was heard, the pulse of the then colonies was tried, and found to beat in unison. The unremitted labor"], [299, "APPENDIX. 293 of our enemies was to divide, anil the policy of every con gress to bind us together. But in m> example was this-1 truth more clearly displayed, than in the prudence with which independence was unfolded to the sight, and in the forbearance to declare it, until America almost unanimous ly called for it. After we bad thus launched into troubles, never before explored, and the hour of heavy distress, the remembrance of our social strength not only fotbade de spair, but drew from congress the most illustrious repetition of their settled purpose to despise all terms, short of inde pendence. Behold, then, how successful and glorroas we have been, while we acted in fralernal concord'. But let us discard the illusion, that by this success, and this glory, the crest of danger has irrecoverably fallen. Our go vernments are yet too youthful lo have acquired stability from habit. Our very quiet depends upon the duration os the union. Among the upright and intelligent, few can read without emotion the future fate of the States, if sever ed from each other. Then shall we learn the full weight of foreign intrigue. Then shall we bear of partitions of our country. If a prince, inflamed by the hist of con quest, should use one State as the instrument of enslaving others \u2014 if every State is to be wearied by perpetual alarms, and compelled to maintain large military establishments \u2014 if all questions are to be decided by an appeal to arms, where a difference of opinion cannot be removed by nego tiation \u2014 in a word, if all the direful misfortunes which haunt the peace of rival nations, are to triumph over the land, for what have we to contend ? why have we exhaust ed our wealth ? why have we basely betrayed the heroic martyrs of the federal cause ? But dreadful as the total dissolution of the union is to my mind, I entertain no less horror at the thought of partial \u25a0confederacies. I have not the least ground for supposing that an overture of this kind would be listened to by a sin-"], [300, "APPENDIX. 294 gle State, and the presumption is, that the politics of the greater part of the States, flow from the warmest attach ment to an union of the whole. If, however, a lesser con federacy could be obtained by Virginia, let me conjure my countrymen well to weigh the probable consequences, be fore they attempt to form it. On such an event, the strength of the union would be divided in two, or perhaps three parts. Has it so increas ed since the war as to be divisible \u2014 and yet remain suffi cient for our happiness ? The utmost limit of any partial confederacy, which Virginia could expect to form, would comprehend the three southern States, and her nearest northern neigh bour. But they, like ourselves, are diminished in their real force, by the mixture of an unhappy species of popu lation. Again, may I ask, whether the opulence of the United States has been augmented since the war ? This is an swered in the negative, by a load of debt, and the declen sion of trade. At all times must a southern confederacy support ships of war, and soldiery? As soon would a navy move from the sorest, and an army spring from the earth, as such a confederacy, indebted, impoverished in its commerce, and destitute of men, could, for some years at least, pro vide an ample defence for itself. Let it not be forgotten, that nations which can enforce their rights, have large claims against the United Stales, and that the creditor may insist on payment from any of them. Which of them would probably be the victim ? the most productive, and the most exposed. When vex ed by reprisals or war, the southern States will sue for alliance on this continent or beyond sea. If for the for mer, the necessity of an union of the whole is decided ; if for the latter, America will, 1 fear, re-act the scenes of confusion and bloodshed, exhibited among most of those"], [301, "APPENDIX. 295 nations, which have, too late, repented the folly of relying on auxiliaries. Two or more confederacies cannot but be competitors for power. The ancient friendship between the citizens of America, being thus cut off, bitterness and hostility will succeed in its place; in order to prepare against surrounding danger, we shall be compelled to vest some where or other, power approaching near to military go vernment. The annals of the world have abounded so much with in stances of a dividod people being a prey to foreign influ ence, that I shall not restrain my apprehensions of it, should our union be torn asunder. The opportunity of in sinuating it, will be multiplied in proportion to the parts in to which we may be broken. In short, sir, I am fatigued with summoning up to my imagination the miseries which will harass the United States, if torn from each other, and which will not end un til they are superseded by fresh mischiefs under the yoke of a tyrant. I come, therefore, to the last, and perhaps only refuge in our difficulties, a consolidation of the union, as far as circumstances will permit. To fulfil this desirable object, the constitution was framed by the federal convention. \u2014 A quorum of eleven States, and the only member from n twelfth have subscribed it ; Mr. Mason, of Virgi nia, Mr. Gerry, of Massachusetts, and myself having refu sed to subscribe. Why I refused, will, I hope, be solved to the satisfaction of those who know me, by saying, that a sense of duty commanded me thus to act. It commanded me, sir, for be lieve me, that no event of my life ever occupied more of my reflection. To subscribe, seemed to offer no inconsid erable gratification, since it would have presented me to the world as a fellow laborer with the learned and zealous statesmen of America."], [302, "296 APPENDIX. But it was far more interesting to my feelings, that I was about to differ from three of my colleagues, one of whom is, to the honor of the country which he has saved, embosomed in their affections, and can receive no praise from the highest lustre of language ; the other two of whom have been long enrolled among the wisest and best lovers of the commonwealth ; and ihe unshaken and in timate friendship of all of whom I have ever prized, and still do prize, as among the happiest of all acquisitions. \u2014 I was no stranger to the reigning partiality for ihe mem bers who composed the convention, and had not the smallest doubt, lhat from this cause, and from the ardor for a reform of government, the first applauses at least would be loud and profuse. I suspected, too, that there was something in the human breast which for a time would be apt to construe a temperateness in politics, into an enmity to the union. Nay, I plainly foresaw, lhat in the dissentions of parties, a middle line would probably be interpreted into a want of enterprise and decision. \u2014 But these considerations, how seducing soever, were fee ble opponents to the suggestions of my conscience. I was sent to exercise my judgment, and to exercise it was my fixed determination ; being instructed by even an im perfect acquaintance with mankind, that self approbation is the only true reward which a political career can be stow, and that popularity would have been but another name for perfidy, if to secure it, I had given up the free dom of thinking for myself. It would have been a peculiar pleasure to me to have ascertained before I left Virginia, the temper and genius of my fellow citizens, considered relatively to a government, so substantially differing from the confederation as that which is now submitted. But this was, for many obvious reasons, impossible ; and I was thereby deprived of what I thought the necessary guides."], [303, "APPENDIX. 297 I saw, however, lhat the confederation was tottering from its own weaknoss, and that the sitting of the con vention was a signal of its total insufficiency. I was therefore ready to assent to a scheme of government, which was proposed, and which went beyond the limits of the confederation, believing, that without being too extensive it would have preserved our tranquility, until that temper and that genius should be collected. But when the plan which is now before the general as sembly, was on ils passage through the convention, I moved, that the State conventions should be at liberty to amend, and that a second general convention should be holden, to discuss the amendments, which should be sug gested by them. This motion was in some measure jus tified by the manner in which the confederation was for warded originally, by congress to the State legislatures, in many of which amendments were proposed, and those amendments were afterwards examined in congress. Such a motion was doubly expedient here, as the delegation of so much more power was sought for. But it was ne gatived. I then expressed my unwillingness to sign. My reasons were the following : 1. It is said in the resolutions which accompany the constitution, that it is to be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each State by the people thereof, for their assent and ratification. The meaning of these terms is allowed universally to be, that the convention must either adopt the constitution in the whole, or reject it in the whole, and is positively forbidden to amend. If therefore, I had signed, I should have felt myself bound to be silent as to amendments, and to endeavor to sup port the\" constitution without the correction of a letter. With this consequence before my eyes, and with a deter mination to attempt an amendment, I was taught by a regard for consistency not to sign. 2. My opinion always was, and still is, that every citi- Nn"], [304, "APPENDIX. 298 ten of America, let the crisis be what it may, ought to. have a full opportunily to propose, through his represen tatives, any amendment which in his apprehension, tends to the public welfare. By signing, I should have con tradicted this sentiment. 3. A constitution ought to have the hearts of the peo ple on its side. But if at a future day it should be bur densome after having been adopted in the whole, and they should insinuate that it was in some measure forced upon them, by being confined to the single alternative of taking or rejecting it altogether, under my impressions, and with my opinions, I should not be able to juslify my self had I signed. 4. I was always satisfied, as I have now experienced, that this great subject would be placed in new lights and attitudes by Ihe criticism of ihe world, and lhat no man can assure himself how a constitution will work for a course of years, until at least he shall have heard the ob servations of the people at large. I also fear more from inaccuracies in a constitution, than from gross errors in any oilier composition ; because our dearest interests are to bo regulated by it ; and power, if loosely given, espe cially where it will be interpreted with great latitude, may bring sorrow in its execution. Had I signed with these ideas, I should have virtually shut my ears against the information which I ardently desired. 5. I was afraid, that if ihe constitution was to be sub mitted to the people, to be wholly adopted or wholly re jected by them, ihey would not only reject it, but bid a lasting farewell to the union. This formidable event I wished to avert, by keeping myself free to propose amendments, and thus, if possible, to remove the obsta cles to an \"effectual government. But it will be asked, whether all these arguments, were not well weighed in convention. They were, sir, with great candor. Nay, when I called to mind the respectability of those, with"], [305, "APPENDIX. 299 \u25a0whom I was associated, I almost lost confidence in these principles. On other occasions, I should cheerfully have yielded to a majority ; on this the fate of thousands yet unborn, enjoined me not to yield until I was convinced. Again, may I be asked, why tho mode pointed out in the constitution for its amendment, may not be a suffi cient security against its imperfeclions, without now ar resting it in its progress ? My answers arc \u2014 1. That it is better to amend, while we have the constitution in our power, while the passions of designing men are. not yet enlisted, and while a bare nmjority of the States may amend than to wait for the uncertain assent of three fourths of the States. 2. That \"a bad feature in government, bo comes more and more fixed every day. 3. That frequent changes of a constitulion, even if praclicable, ought not to be wished, but avoided as much as possible. And 4. That in ihe present Tasc, it may be questionable, whether, after the particular advantages of ils operation shall be discerned, three sourlhs of the States can be induced to amend. I confess, lhat it is no easy task, to devise a scheme which shall be suitable to the views of all. Many expe dients have occurred lo me, but none of them appear less exceptionable than this ; lhat if our convention should choose to amend, another federal convention be recom mended : lhat in that federal convention the amend ments proposed by ibis or any oilier Slate be discussed ; and if incorporated in the constitution or rcjecled, or isa proper number of ihe oilier Stales should be unwilling to accede to a second convention, tbe constitulion be again laid besoie the same State conventions, which shall again assemble on the summons of ihe executives, and it shall be either wholly adopted, or wholly rejected, without a further power of amendment. I count such a delay as nothing in comparison with so grand an object ; especi ally too as the privilege of amending must terminate as ter the use of it once."], [306, "300 APPENDIX. I should now conclude this letter, which is already too long, were it hot incumbent oh me, from having contend ed for amendments, to set forth the particulars, which I conceive to require correction. I undertake this with re luctance : because it is remote from my intentions 'to catch the prejudices or prepossessions of any man. But as I mean only to manifest that I have not been actuated by caprice, and now to explain every objection at full length would be an immense labour, I shall content my self with enumerating certain heads, in which the consti tution is most repugnant to my wishes. The two first points and the equality of suffrage in the senate, and the submission of commerce to a mere major ity in the legislature, with no other check than the revi sion of the president. I conjecture that neither of these things can be corrected ; and particularly tbe former, without which we must have risen perhaps in disorder. But I am sanguine in hoping that in every other justly obnoxious cause, Virginia will be seconded by a majority of the States. I hope that she will be seconded. 1. In causing all ambiguities of expression to be precisely ex plained. 2. In rendering the president ineligible after a given number of years. 3. In taking from him the pow er of nominating to the judiciary offices, or of filling up vacancies which may there happen during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions which shall expire \u2022at the end of their next sessions. 4. In taking from him the power of pardoning for treason at least before con viction. 5. In drawing a line between the powers of con gress and individual States ; and in defining the former, so as to leave no clashing of jurisdictions nor dangerous disputes ; and to prevent the one from being swallowed up by the other, under cover of general words, and im plication. 6. In abridging the power of the senate to make treaties supreme laws of the land. 7. In incapaci tating the congress to determine their own salaries. And 8. In limiting and defining the judicial power."], [307, "APPENDIX.

At the age of sixteen he was sent by his parents to the city of New York, where he received a classical education, and afterwards studied the law with William Livingston, Esq., a cele- brated barrister in that metropolis, and father of Brock- hoist Livingston, Esq., one of the judges of the supreme court of the United Stales. On the completion of his studies he was admitted to the bar, and soon after fixed his residence in the city of Albany, where in due time he received the degrees of solicitor and counsellor in the court of chancery \u2014 He soon became eminent in his pro- fession, and on account of his incorruptable iniegriiy was known by the appellation of the honest Lawyer \u2014 At the age of twenty-seven ho married Miss Jane Van Ness, of Columbia county. On the prospect of a ruplure, between this country and Great Britain, his open and avowed principles as a whig brought him into polilical notice, and several well written essays, which were the produc- tions of his pen, contributed in no small degree to establish his reputation as a writer in defence of the rights and liberties of his country. He had already held a seat as a member of the corporation of the city of Albany and as attorney and counsel to that board ; and he was soon af- ter appointed a member of the committee of public safety, a body of men who were invested with almost inquisi torial powers, and who had justly become the dread and scourge of that class of men called tories. \u2014 By the exertions of Chief Justice Yates, the proceedings of"], [310, "304 APPENDIX. that tribunal were tempered with moderation, and the patriotic zeal of the community confined within its proper and legitimate sphere of action. We find him not long afterwards holding a seat in the provincial congress of his own State, and, during the recess of that body, performing the complicated and arduous du ties of chairman of a committee for the organizatiun and direction of military operations against the common ene my. In the year 1777, the constitution of this State was adopted, and Chief Justice Yates was an active and dis tinguished mcmber^of the convention that framed that in strument \u2014 During the same year he received without so licitation the appointment of a judge of the supreme court, at a time when an extensive and lucrative practice as a lawyer held out to him strong inducements to de cline its acceptance \u2014 Regardless however of private in terest, he entered upon the duties of that office render ed at the time peculiarly delicate and dangerous. He sat upon the bench, as a writer has expressed it, \" with a halter about his neck,\" exposed to punishment as a rebel, had our efforts for emancipation proved abortive \u2014 nor were these the least of his dangers. For in coun ties ravaged or possessed by the enemy, or by se cret domestic foes watching every opportunity to ru in or betray their country, he was sometimes ob liged to hold his courts \u2014 But no dangers could ap pal nor fears deter him from a faithful and honest performance of the funclions of his office \u2014 He was par ticularly distinguished for his impartiality, in the tri als of State criminals, and he was not unfrequently ob liged to abate the intemperate zeal or ill-judged patriot ism of the juries who were to decide upon the fate of unfortunate prisoners \u2014 On one occasion he sent a jury from the bar sour times successively to reconsider a ver dict of conviction which they had pronounced most unwarrantably against the accused, merely because they"], [311, "APPENDIX. 305 suspected he was a lory, though without any proof that could authorize the verdict \u2014 As the accused had become very obnoxious to the great body of the whigs, the legislature were inflamed and seriously contempla- ted calling Chief Justice Yates before them to answer for his conduct \u2014 But he was alike indifferent to cen- sure or applause in the faithful and independent ex- ercise of his judicial duties, and the legislature at length prudently dropt the affair. His salary during the war was very small, and hardly sufficient for the support of himself and firaily \u2014 Indeed before the scale of deprecia- tion of continental money had been settled, he received one year's salary in that money at its nominal value, the, whole of which was just sufficient (as he humourously ob- served) \" to purchase a pound of green tea for his wife.\" \u2014 He was often urged to unite with some of his friends in speculation on forfeited estates during the war, by which he might easily have enriched himself and his connexions without censure or suspicion \u2014 and although such speculations were common, yet he would not con- sent to become wealthy upon the ruin of others. \" No\" said he, \" I will sooner die a beggar than own a foot of land acquired by such means.\" In September 1776, George Clinton afterward executive of this State, anxioug to receive the co-operation of chief justice Yates in cer- tain measures then deemed important and necessary, ad- dressed him a letter of which the following is an extract: \" We have at last, arrived at a most important crisis, \" which will either secure the independence of our country \u2022\u2022\" or determine that she shall still remain in a state of vas- \" salage to Great Britain.

Christopher Yates, the father of Joseph C.

After the conclusion of the revolutionary war, he was chosen together with General Hamilton and Chancellor Lansings to represent his native State in the convention that formed the constitution of the United States; and to his labors in that convention we are indebted for ihe preservation of some of the most important debates that ever distinguished any age or country** \u2014 He was also a. member of the convention subsequently held in this State to whom that constitution was submitted for adoption and ratification\u2014 -His political opinions were open and* ureserved \u2014 He was opposed to a consolidated national government, and friendly to a confederation of the States preserving their integrity and equality as such.. Al-. though the form of government eventually adopted, was not, in all its parts, agreeable to his views and wishes, \u2022till in all his discussions, and especially in bis judicial capacity, he deemed it a sacred duty to inculcate entire submission to, and reverence for, that constitution \u2014 In the first charge which he delivered to a grand jury, im- mediately after its adoption, he used the following lan luage fl the proposed form of government for the union \u2022 Chief Justice Vales, though often solicitor, refused during his life, to permit his notes of those debates to be publ.sl^-d, not ouly because they were originally not written lor the public eve, but beeanse he conceived himself under honorable obligations to withhold their publication\u2014 These notes after I. is death tell into the hands, of his widow, who disposed of them* *nd they are thus become pubiio."], [313, "APPENDIX. 307 \" has at length received the sanction of so many of the \" States as to make it the supreme law of the land, and it \" is not therefore any longer a question whether or not \"its provisions are such as they ought to be in all their \" different branches.

Determined however to provide for an old and faithful public servant, who had worn out his better days for the good of his country, the legislature appointed him a commissioner to settle disputed titles to lands in the military tract, and this appointment he held till near ly the close of his life, when the law creating it, ceas ed by*\u00ab*its own limitation. On the 9th day of September 1801, he finished his mortal career, \" full of honors and full of years,\" placing a firm reliance on the merits of an aloning Savour, and ihe goodness of a merciful God. \u2014 He left a widow and four children, two of whom only are now living, a son and daughter, the former of whom is the present secretary of this State. Chief Justice Yates died poor. \u2014 He had always been indifferent to his own private interest, for his benevolent and patiiotic feelings could not be regulated nor restrain- ed by the cold calculations of avarice or gain. No man in this State was more esteemed than himself \u2014 He never had, it is believed, in the whole course of his life, a personal en- emy, and thetears of the widow, the orphan, the destitute and oppressed, followed him to his grave : \u2014 He was em- phatically the honest man and the upright judge. \u2014 His talents were of the highest order, and his manners were plain, attractive and unassuming \u2014 His opinions at nisi prius were seldom found to be incorrect, and on the bench of the supreme court he was distinguished for a clear, discriminating mind, that readily arrived at the true merits of the case before him. It may be safely affirm- ed, that no single individual ever filled so many high and responsible stations with greater credit to himself, and honor to the Slate. \u2014 His memory will be cherished as long as virtue is esteemed and talents respected, and his epitaph is written in the hearts of his fellow citizens, and the history of his country."], [315, ""], [316, ""], [317, ""], [318, ""], [319, ""], [320, ""]]
