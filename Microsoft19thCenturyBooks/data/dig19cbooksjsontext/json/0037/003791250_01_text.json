The revolution of 1830 having compelled Marshal Marmont to expatriate himself, he took up his resi dence at Vienna, where he remained until 1834, when, becoming weary of the monotony of an inactive hfe, he set out on a tour through Hungary, Transylvania, Southern Russia, the Krimea, Turkey, and Egypt. Of this tour the Marshal has published a journal, in which he has minutely described everything that came under his observation. An attentive perusal of this work can hardly fail to suggest the idea, that the principal object of the author has been to impress his readers with the belief of the declining state of the Turkish Empire. The Marshal's statements on this point are too clear to be misunderstood; he predicts not only that its fall is inevitable, but that it cannot be long delayed. Any work from the pen of so distinguished a man as Marshal Marmont must ever excite attention, but the present one is eminently calculated to create the deepest interest, and more especially at a period \u00ab2"], [8, "IV INTRODUCTION. when the eyes of the statesman, tlie soldier, and the merchant, are directed to the East as the probable theatre of great pohtical events, which cannot fail to have an influence on the well-being of every state in Europe. The interference of a neighbouring power in the affairs of Turkey, must naturally be regarded with apprehension by herself, and with jealousy by the rest of Europe. The motives of such interference are open to suspicion, because the strength of this aUy would necessarily be increased in proportion as that of Turkey might be diminished. England is, of aU powers, the most able to exercise an influence in the regeneration of Turkey, and, from her position, is perhaps the least likely to have the honesty of her intentions either doubted by the Porte, or impugned by any other nation. If she will therefore exert her energies in such a cause, Turkey can still be saved from the grasp of Russia, whose future interest, what ever may be her present wishes and professions, will be advanced by destroying the Turkish Empire. Under this impression it is thought that a transla tion of that part of the Marshal's work which treats more particularly of Turkey and her relations with other powers, may be calculated to draw attention to this important subject, and it is therefore offered to the British public, with the addition of such observa tions as the translator feels called upon to make in opposition to the Marshal's arguments and to the theory which he has founded upon them.

He afterwards crossed the Russian frontier and pro ceeded to Odessa, where he remained for some days. During his stay in that city he made excursions in the neighbourhood, and visited the Russian military colonies, of which he gives a most minute and valuable description. From Odessa he went to the Krimea, where, under the guidance of Count Woronzow, he inspected all that was considered most worthy of his notice, and he took leave of that amiable and excellent nobleman at Kosloff, to proceed to Constantinople. From the period of his arrival in the city of the Sultan, the Marshal's observations will be given in as literal a translation of the original as has been found practicable. But the notice of the former part of his work will be confined to a brief description of the more prominent and interesting matter, contained in his relation of the journey from Vienna to the ELrimea, to which will be added some information derived from other sources."], [10, "INTRODUCTION ro THE SECOND EDITION, 1854. The introduction to the first edition of the transla tion of Marshal Marmont's \" Present State of the Turkish Empire\" was written in 1839, and we now see (in 1854) in the development of the intrigues of Russia, how truly her object and wishes, and the probable course of action to effect them, were predicted and made mani fest in the \"Observations of the Translator on the pohtical relations of England with Turkey and Russia;\" how faithless she has been to her allies ; how regardless of treaties ; how insidious in her pohcy ; and how crafty and persevering in her attempts to bring about the dismemberment, and indeed the annihilation, of the Turkish Empire, which so long as it shall retain any degree of independence, will form an effectual barrier to the further encroachments and spoliations of Russia. But while Russia thus pursues a course so contrary to all her open professions, she is losing the respect of all the great powers in Europe, even of those who have adopted a neutral pohcy in the great struggle which is on the eve of taking place, and the duration of which no human being can calculate; \u2014 a neutral pohcy in"], [11, "INTRODUCTION.

The day of reckoning may be deferred, but come it will, and the longer delayed the heavier will be the penalty the Western Powers will exact. The translation of Marshal Marmont's work being out of print, and a flattering demand having been made for it by officers proceeding to the seat of war in the East, the translator has been induced, on the advice of some respected friends, to issue a second edition, in which the chapters on the \"political relations\" have been extended to include the events relating to Turkey up to the present time."], [12, ""], [13, "ON THE POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. WRITTEN IN 1839, AND PUBLISHED WITH THE FIRST EDITION OF THE TRANSLATION OF MARSHAL MARMONT'S WORK ON THE STATE OF THE TURKISH EMPIRE. The observations which Marshal Marmont has made in various parts of his work on the Turkish Empire, as to the pacific intentions of Russia, are deserving of deliberate attention, springing as they do from so high a source ; but they nevertheless seem utterly irrecon cilable both with the fact of her past aggressions, and with the evidence which her present attitude affords of her ambitious views. An examination into the encroachments which Russia has made from the reign of Peter the Great to the present time, cannot fail to produce the conviction that a system of territorial aggression has hitherto formed a main feature of her pohcy ; and a careful investigation of her more recent political acts, cannot leave a doubt on the mind that her ambition is not yet satisfied. It is quite notorious, that the acquisitions of Russia, within httle more than half a century, are equal in importance and extent to the whole territory which she a 3"], [14, "POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND X previously possessed in Europe, and the foUowing state ment of her aggressive course may be relied on.

Between the accession of Peter in 1689, and the death of Alexander in 1825, the population of Russia has been augmented in numbers from fifteen to fifty eight millions. Hitherto the aggressions of Russia have apparently had only an indirect and perhaps a remote influence on the interests of England, and with some slight excep tions have not materially injured her commerce; but unless they are speedily arrested, consequences must ensue which in ah probability will eventually prove fatal to Enghsh ascendency in the East. Marshal Marmont has stated that Nicholas has no"], [15, "WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XI aggressive views ; and that \" a Sovereign whose empire comprises a surface equal to a seventh part of all the continents of the globe, has no need of its extension ; nor having under his sceptre sixty millions of people, has he reason for desiring to increase their number.\"* To give these arguments a title to our confidence, they should be borne out both by the recent pohtical conduct of Russia, and by her present bearing ; but what has been the course she has pursued ? She has encroached on every one of her neighbours, and it would be doubting the clearest evidence to deny that she is persevering with equal energy and skill, although less openly, in the system which during a long series of years she has followed with such extraordinary success. She has pressed upon Turkey \u2014 she has sub jugated the Georgians \u2014 she is still oppressing the Circassians. Within the last two years she has ad vanced her frontier from the Caucasus to the banks of the Araxes, a distance of 400 miles. She is interesting herself with subtlety in the affairs of Turkey, and is striving to prevent the interference of any other power with that state. She is using every effort to acquire supremacy in the councils of Persia, to the obvious injury of English commerce; and she is fomenting disturbances among the nations near the northern boundary of Hindostan. It seems not unreasonable to assume that one of the chief causes of this conduct on the part of Russia, is the hope of becoming a great commercial state at the ex pense of England. What other reason can induce the Czar, during a period of profound peace, to maintain the large fleets which are now in readiness for service, * Vide page 138."], [16, "POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND XII both in the Baltic and the Black Sea, as well as the gigantic mihtary force, amounting to no less than seven hundred thousand men ?* Marshal Marmont says, that the sole motive for the conduct of Russia with regard to Turkey, is to secure for Russian commerce a free passage through the DardaneUes; but surely it is not necessary for this single object that Russia should enter into treaties which have the effect of excluding the ships of war of every other nation from the Black Sea. Her inter ference with the Ottoman Emphe, and the pohcy she displays in other quarters, rather bear the stamp of aggressive objects than of a desire for that security wliich constitutes the only legitimate ground for conquest. Indeed, the Marshal himself observes, that although the prosperity of Russia requires her to have the right of passage through the DardaneUes, yet, if this strait became exclusively her own, she would be enabled to threaten the hberties of Europe ;\\ an admission that shows how necessary it is to deprive her of this danger ous power.

Note of the French Charge d' Affaires at St. Petersburg. \" The undersigned, Charge d' Affaires of his Majesty the King of the French, is instructed to express to the Cabinet of St. Petersburg the profound affliction which the French Government has experienced on learning the conclusion of the Treaty of the 8th July last, be tween his Majesty the Emperor of Russia and the Grand Signior. In the opinion of the King's Govern ment, that Treaty imparts to the relations between the Ottoman Empire and the Empire of Russia a -new character, to which all the powers of Europe have a right to object. The undersigned is therefore in structed to declare, that if the stipulations of that Treaty were hereafter to bring on the armed interven tion of Russia in the internal affairs of Turkey, the French Government would hold itself wholly at liberty to adopt such a hne of conduct as circumstances might suggest, acting from that moment as if the said Treaty was not in existence. The undersigned is also desired to inform the Imperial Cabinet that a simUar declara tion has been delivered to the Ottoman Porte by his Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. (Signed) \" I. de Lagrene.\" Reply ofthe Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs. \"The undersigned has received the note by which M. I. de Lagrene, Charge d' Affaires of his Majesty the King of the French, has communicated the deep regret which the conclusion of the Treaty of the 8th of July,"], [18, "XIV POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND between Russia and the Porte, has caused the French Government, without stating at the same time either the motives of that regret, or the nature of the objec tions to which that Treaty may give rise. The under signed cannot be acquainted wdth them \u2014 stUl less can he understand them. The Treaty of the 8th of July is purely defensive ; it has been concluded between two independent powers, exercising the plenitude of their rights, and it does no prejudice to the interests of any state whatever. \" What could, therefore, be the objections which other powers might deem themselves justified in raising against such a proceeding ? How, above aU, could they declare that they consider it of no validity, unless they have in view the subversion of an empire which the Treaty is destined to preserve ? But such cannot be the design of the French Government. It would be at open variance vrith aU the declarations it made in the last complications in the East. The undersigned must, therefore, suppose that the opinion expressed in M. de Lagrene's note rests upon incorrect data, and that, when better informed by the communication of the Treaty which the Porte has recently made known to the French Ambassador at Constantinople, his Government wiU rightly appreciate the value and usefulness of a transaction concluded in a spirit as pacific as it is con servative. \" That act changes, indeed, the nature of the rela tions between Russia and the Porte ; for it terminates a long enmity, and is the commencement of relations of intimacy and confidence wherein the Turkish Govern ment wUl henceforth find a guarantee of stability, and, if need be, a means of defence calculated to ensure its preservation."], [19, "WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XV \" It is in this conviction, and guided by the purest and most disinterested intentions, that his Majesty the Emperor is resolved on faithfully fulfilling, should the occasion present itself, the obligations which the Treaty ot the 8th of July imposes upon him, acting thus as if the declaration contained in M.de Lagrene'snote didnotexist.

It cannot be doubted that the English Cabinet, enter taining, as it must have done, simUar sentiments to those of the Cabinet of France, was equally determined and exphcit in its communication with the Government of Russia, and if so it wiU be open to England to act, shoidd occasion arise, precisely as she would have done had the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi never been entered into. The time seems not far distant when a bold line of pohcy on the part of England wiU be requisite, or we shall see Turkey fixed for ever in the cold and iron grasp of Russia. Marshal Marmont says that Russia is already suffi ciently extensive. Admitting, for the sake of argu ment, that this is really the case, and that it is the opinion entertained by the present Emperor, stiU this is no proof that he considers her sufficiently rich. If he does not contemplate either extending his acquisi tions into more wealthy countries, or assuming a posi tion that wiU give him greater commercial advantages, we are at a loss to find a reason for his pushing forward to the Persian frontier, and contending for the com-"], [20, "XVI POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND paratively unproductive territory which intervenes between that country and the Caucasus. Nicholas, who sees that the wealth of England is the result of her extended commerce, is naturally the more desirous of adding to the commerce of Russia. Know ing, however, that at present an attempt to rival or compete with England in the West would prove a hope less task, his attention is directed to the East, and it seems reasonable to conclude that he regards our Indian Empire not only as a great source of our com mercial prosperity, but also of our maritime strength, and that he therefore considers that the course of pohcy which would deprive us of the former, would ultimately tend to destroy the latter. There are those who are of opinion that Russia, however desirous of effecting such an object, wUl never be able to deprive England of her Indian possessions, and that the Emperor is so thoroughly convinced of this, that he wiU never dare to make the attempt. That Russia could not in the present state of affairs succeed, except as a consequence of unpardonable and improbable neglect of the interests of the British Empire, we freely admit ; but nevertheless the security of our Indian territory should be placed beyond aU doubt, by the adoption of every safeguard that the wisdom of our statesmen can devise, and by foUowing such a course of pohcy towards the neighbouring states, as weU as towards the native princes, as wUl give them confidence in our power to protect or to conquer, and restore that behef in our good faith, which many of our acts have tended to destroy. That in Russia the project of conquests in India has long been entertained, cannot be doubted, and indeed it excited the attention of Peter."], [21, "WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XVII Marshal Marmont has shown us that Napoleon con templated an attack on India, and surely the prospect of success was infinitely less for him at that time than it now is for the Russian monarch : and so great is the temptation which the mere chance of success pre sents, as compared with the amount of injury that Russia would sustain by defeat, that we fully believe the attempt wUl be made sooner or later, though pro bably, in the first instance, rather by intrigue than by open force. This, however, is a point on which opinions are much divided, and on which much has been written. A noble and distinguished author* has in his very inte resting work on Russia, brought into a narrow com pass the arguments of several writers on this subject, and as he has also favoured us with his own views on it, we think it wUl not be unacceptable to the reader to have these several opinions placed before him in their condensed form. \" There is,\" says the Marquess, \" much difference of opinion (in Russia) as to the advantage of greater aggrandizement, or the pohcy of rendering formidable, by wise and salutary interior regulations, the immense territories that are already incorporated under the dominion of the Czar. \" It may not be superfluous to consider very shortly the general pohtical situation of Russia, more especiaUy as two able and clever pamphlets have just made their appearance in England, which, no doubt, have been much read ; and as these pubhcations embrace opinions on the same questions, wide as the poles asun der, I think it not presumptuous, in some degree, to * The Marquess of Londonderry."], [22, "POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND XVIII differ from both, and to consider the writers as having taken exaggerated views of a very extensive question. \"The author of the 'Manchester Manufacturer' would lead his readers to imagine, in the outset, that he was entirely impartial in his sentiments and opi nions, and was not biassed by any friendship of Russia ; whereas I consider it hardly possible for any one to read his pages, without regarding him as a most decided partisan of the Northern Empire and its interests. I admit the existence of great ingenuity and talent, and some force of reasoning, in many of the points that are brought forward ; but when the author teUs you that Constantinople would not add to the power or resources of Russia ; when he supposes that in an age hke this the nations of the world could live in harmony together, plying the industrious loom, and having no emulation beyond the possession of the cheapest commodities in the commercial markets of the world ; and when he finally enters into a special pleading with high authorities, such as the famous Vienna writer, Genz, and others, and argues so strangely on the balance of power, I do confess it lessens my opinion of the judgment and wis dom ofthe writer of this treatise. \" The second pamphlet I now aUude to, is ' Russia and her Acquisitions in 1836.' The author here dis plays a gigantic map, and marks, accurately enough, the encroachments of the Czars, by conquests, treaties, or treachery, since the time of Peter the Great, and founds upon this exhibited surface of continued ambi tion, the certain argument, that the same course must stiU be pursued, in defiance of any changes that time and experience may produce in the sentiments of the Russians, or of the guarantee afforded by the personal character for wisdom and prudence of the existing"], [23, "WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XIX Sovereign. I disagree as much in the inference drawn by this latter writer, as I do in the theories of the for mer. The very circumstance of the great accessions of territory produces, at present, an undigested interior, composed of very difficult materials to organise in unity of action. To make this mass more unmanageable by unnecessary increase, whilst its component parts create, even now, disquietude, and demand aU the energies of the Government, is not the part of a great and wise Sovereign, and it is but fair and just, on passing a posi tive opinion as to what the measures of Russia wUl be, to examine the recent acts of the chief whom Provi dence has placed at the head of this colossal empire. \" It would be bold to predict what the position of Russia may be, some hundred years hence. Un doubtedly the rapid progress she has made in civiliza tion and improvement since the war with France, and since her legions were transported from the banks of the Volga, the Don, and the Vistula, to those of the Seine, surpasses behef. Since 1815, she has advanced in these respects, at least a century. The practical observation which her masses of men made on the cul tivated states and territories through which they passed ; the taste which was thus imbibed for southern luxuries ; the indefatigable exertions and efforts of the Emperor Alexander to obtain every possible advantage for his rising empire, \u2014 aU conspired, with the great genius, industry, and talent of the people, to improve Russia in a singular degree. The golden opportunity of the long peace since 1815, has not been thrown away in the hands of Alexander and Nicholas. Indeed, it is won derful to witness how greatly the latter has avaUed him self of aU the foundations prepared by the former, and I feel assured that those who descant largely in the"], [24, "POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND XX British Parliament, on the situation of Russia, would do well to examine the country in the details, before they venture on statements which their ocular obser vations would disprove. Russia, in my opinion, is directing her mighty means to bring to perfection aU parts of that empire which acknowledge her sway, before she attempts to grapple with more extent of dominion. Whether she can manage and govern well what she possesses, is a primary question ; to seize upon more before this is ascertained, would greatly endanger what exists. \" As a mere opinion, I should assert, that Russia will have no objects of aggrandizement for the next fifty years, that would not be hostile to the feehngs and prejudices of the Emperor, unwise in the estimation of the nobles, and prejudicial to the nation itself. \"While the writer of 'Russia in 1836' was talking of new kingdoms, and of the seizure of places, the Emperor Nicholas was voluntarily restoring to the Sultan Silistria, one of the keys of Turkey. No greater proof can surely be adduced, that the object of Russia is not the conquest of Turkey, nor the march to Constantinople.* The Emperor fuU weU knows, that to subdue the religious prejudices of such a nation as that of Turkey, and to run the risk of a war with the powers of Europe in the effort, is what he is incapable of attempting without absolute necessity. Even at Adrianople, as in other places equally distant from their resources, and where they could not be provided beforehand, the Russian masses were broken down by disease, misery, and want ; and the longer their line is extended, the easier prey does it become to predatory warfare in a hostile country. * How singularly contradicted by the present conduct of the Czar ! (April, 1854.)"], [25, "AVITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XXI In addition, can it be supposed that the nobles of St. Petersburg or Moscow would hke to see their penates transferred to the shores of the Bosphorus, and would an Emperor of Russia abandon his Petersburg, and live in a Turkish capital ? There is a very great disin clination amongst all the Russians I have conversed with, to the conquest of other dominions, and many are found, who consider that civilization is advancing too rapidly for the real happiness and prosperity of the nation. \" In giving these sentiments, I know I differ from much higher authorities, amongst the rest Marshal Marmont, who in his tour in Hungary, Transylvania, Southern Russia, Turkey, &c. has broadly laid it down, not only that the Russians with the greatest ease can take possession of Constantinople, but he also offers to prove, that the occupation once effected, the most inti mate alhance of France, England, and Austria, could not force the Russians to evacuate it. The Marshal then enters upon the long military hypothesis on which his reasoning is based. Far be it from me to follow this, probably, well digested professional treatise; but my simple question is, how is Russia now, or at any future time, within the next century, to supply the means and the sinews of war, for such an undertaking ? What would be easy and light to the financial means of such a triple aUiance against her, would be impracticable for Russia alone ; and both the nation and its chief, I beheve, are fully aware of this impossibility. The Marshal, however, sums up his reasoning by two con siderations, which he admits have their value against the opinions he dehvers. First he says, that aU the advantages he points out in favour of the Russians. belong to the first occupant ; that is to say, if our com-"], [26, "XXII POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND bined fleet passed the DardaneUes and arrived first at Constantinople, and if, with an army, we could then occupy Adrianople with a fortified camp, the Russians would have immense difficulties to overcome. The pro bability is, however, we should pass the DardaneUes before any fleet of Russia could be in force there ; and, without any debarkation of land troops for a fortified camp at Adrianople, I think the Russians would hardly take possession of Constantinople in presence of the combined fleets of France and England. \" Treating, therefore, as I do, the ideas of further conquests at present, and a notion of a march to Con stantinople by Russia, as perfectly chimerical, I am disposed to argue, a fortiori, that any designs upon our Indian possessions are a mere dream ; at the same time, I admit the good pohcy of Great Britain, in cementing in every possible manner friendships and aUiances with Turkey and Persia. Both must be either entirely sub dued, or under the dictation of Russia, before the safety of India could be endangered. Is this a result hkely to occur within the range of time in wliich the calcula tion of future events is reasonably possible ? \" After carefully considering this important question, we fully coincide with the noble Marquess in believing that there is very httle prospect of Russia succeeding at present in any attempt on India ; but we concur never theless in opinion with the author of \" The progress and present position of Russia in the East,\" that the policy of Russia is decidedly aggressive, and that first the subjugation of Turkey, and then the conquest of India, are the objects which she has in view. When on the other hand it is advanced that Russia is aheady too extensive to be strong, and that further extension would produce nothing but weakness, it does"], [27, "WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XXIII not appear to us that the case is fairly stated. Many of her late acquisitions may be regarded as purely terri torial, and whUe they have added nothing to the wealth of the empire, they have probably diminished for a time its relative strength, because considered politically as weU as mechanicaUy, force is produced by concentration. But the true way of looking at the recent acquisitions of Russia, is to regard them as means for the attainment of some great end. They are hke the approaches of a skilful engineer, in the attack of a fortified place ; and Turkey may be considered as an outwork, which when captured wiU not only be valuable in itself, but lead to further success. The conquest or subjugation of Turkey would anni- hUate an empire, which for upwards of a century has been the inveterate foe of Russia ; and whUe it would give the latter a defensible and well-defined boundary, it would add to her present possessions a territory which, both from its natural fertility and from the facility it would give for advancing her commercial prosperity, could not faU to produce ultimately a great increase of her wealth and power. With the Baltic on the one side, and with the Mediterranean, the Euxine, and the Cas pian on the other, and with the inland navigation con necting her western with her eastern states, besides the raUway communications which are contemplated, Russia would of necessity rise with rapidity to the position of a great commercial power. The retention of the sovereignty of India by England depends upon several important points, and amongst these the most prominent are the maritime supremacy of England \u2014 the adoption of such a system of good government in India as shaU firmly attach the natives \u2014 the success of Enghsh diplomacy in maintain-"], [28, "POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND XXIV ing amicable relations with the nations beyond the Indus ; and lastly, the strength of the Ottoman Empire and its fidelity to England. It is chiefly with the latter we have at present to deal, for this is not the place to treat of the internal government of India, nor of its relations with the bor dering states, which doubtless will now have the anxious attention of the Enghsh Government. Our object here is to prove that Turkey may again become a formidable Empire ; that it is not only more within the power, but that it would more conduce to the interest of England, than to that of any other state, to raise Turkey into im portance, if not into a state of independence ; and that it is of vast moment to both, in the present position of affairs in the East, that this should be effected with the utmost promptitude \u2014 to England, as a means of check ing the aggressive projects of the Russians \u2014 to Turkey, as a means of securing her existence as an independent state. Russia dare not proceed to any overt act against our Indian possessions, until she has rendered Turkey so completely subservient to her, as to be compeUed to co-operate in shutting out the British fleet from the DardaneUes and Bosphorus. For if, as we contend she ought to do, England were to send a formidable fleet into the Black Sea, she might then threaten the hne of operations of the Russians, and check their advance towards the Indus. But so long as the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi is respected, so long wiU the Enghsh fleet be prevented from passing through the Darda neUes and Bosphorus, and Russia wUl be at liberty to pursue her course of conquest and aggression.

XXV the Circassians to set their oppressors at defiance, but she could also assist the Georgians to recover their independence, and with the aid of these two nations she might then threaten the Russians even on the Caspian. Russia is aware that such would be the case ; and holds Turkey in subjection, under the conviction that she is of great importance to her, not merely for present protection, but also as a means of future aggression, by facilitating an attack on our Eastern Empire. Again, it is weU known that Russia has long been desirous of possessing a harbour in the Mediterranean, both for commercial and warlike purposes. Smyrna is the one that would most promote the commercial advancement of Russia, and unless the policy of the other great powers is speedily changed towards the Ottoman Empire, not only Turkey in Europe, but Turkey in Asia, wUl faU under the dominion of Russia, and as a matter of course she wiU then become pos sessed of Smyrna, which is one of the finest ports in the world. The question which therefore appears to us to be now of more importance than any other connected with foreign affairs, that can engage the attention of the British statesman, is how to save the Turkish Emphe. There may be doubts as to the real feelings of the Sultan towards England, as weU as towards Russia, and also as to his seeing through the veil of pretended friendship, with which the latter seeks to hide her ambitious projects. These are speculations, however, into which it is unnecessary to enter, for it is known that in the councils of the Grand Signior there are men who, although they may still feel mortified at having been abandoned by England and France, when both were apphed to for that succour which the Rus- b"], [30, "POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND XXVI sians were glad to afford, yet are aware that if they could rely on the firmness of England, it is to her, their old and natural ally, they should attach themselves. For the Turks cannot fail to perceive, in whatever manner the question may be mystified, that the essential difference between the protection or aUiance of Russia, and that of England, is, that while it is the manifest interest of the former to annex Turkey as an integral portion of her dominions, it is still more clearly the interest of England to secure the independence of Turkey, and to give her aU the energy and force of which she is susceptible. That Russia possesses great influence in Turkey is unquestioned, but it is an influence created not by affection, or by a sense of obligation, but by that dread of power which a feeble state must ever entertain of a strong and grasping neighbour. Whatever may be their dread of the Russsians at the present moment, the Turks entertain no fear of being able to defy them, if time and a fair opportunity for organization were allowed. For they have not for gotten that the best troops of Russia, commanded by her ablest generals, took two campaigns to pass the Balkan, and lost in the operation the greater part of their force ;* neither are they unobservant of the im potent attempts of Russia to subdue a handful of Cir cassians ; and it is believed that though the Turks are aware that their soldiers are not at present on a par with those of Russia, they conceive themselves in no degree inferior to the Russians as sailors. * The Russian army marched with a force of 150,000 men, and what from disease, the sword, the consequences of a bad commissariat, and the necessity of leaving troops to garrison fortified places on their line of march, only 30,000 are said to have reached Adrianople."], [31, "WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XXVII We may therefore conclude that the Turks are ready to avail themselves of any fair pretext for throwing off the Russian yoke, and that they would naturally look to England rather than to any other power for assistance. The regeneration of Turkey can, however, only be effected by her acquiring such physical force as wiU enable her to become independent of Russia, and by her adopting such a system of civU government as wiU give security to life and property, and promote agricul ture and commerce, while a valuable improvement of her financial position may be at the same time effected When the occupiers of the land shall have a certainty, that no demand wiU be made beyond such a fixed tax as will leave them a fair remuneration for their labour, agriculture wiU necessarily flourish ; and in order to produce this certainty, httle else appears to be requisite than the regular payment, from the public revenues, of the district pachas, with all their subordinates, and the infliction of severe penalties on any functionary who may make illegal exactions from the people. But it is not proposed to enter now into details that are understood by the more enlightened Turks, and which must be obvious to foreigners who have con sidered the subject, and who are acquainted with the extortions of persons in authority in Eastern countries. \u2022Our present business is more immediately with the naval and military force of the Ottoman Emphe. The Turkish navy would probably have soon re covered from the effects of its defeat at Navarino, had it not been for the separation of Greece from Turkey, for it was from the former country that the crews of the Turkish ships were generally obtained. But we b 2"], [32, "XXVIII POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND may hope from the specimen afforded by the crew of the Mahmoudie, which consisted entirely of Turks, and whose extraordinary expertness excited the astonish ment of Marshal Marmont, that the whole of the Turkish fleet might by proper discipline become equally efficient, and that by the aid of experienced English officers, it might soon be made a match for the Russian fleet. The inefficiency of the Turkish army is admitted, and it is conceived to be the result of the three foUowing causes : 1st. An injudicious system of recruiting ; 2nd. A deficiency of inteUigent officers; and 3rd. An erroneous system of tactics. These defects are remediable, and remembering the gallant feats of the Turks in former days, when they threatened aU Christendom, we may rest satisfied that if their army were weU organized, and skilfully em ployed, they would soon be able to defy theh* Northern neighbours, for there is no reason to question the bravery of the Turkish people, however unsuccessful in their recent wars. The difficulty seems to be for England to find the fitting opportunity for taking Turkey under her pro tection. This must soon be done, or Russia wUl put it out of the power of any other state to interfere, and it is a question whether we are not even now (1839) too late, if the report be true that the Russian fleet is already at the Dardanelles, and that Russia is preparing a military force to occupy a part of the Turkish terri tory. Notwithstanding aU the caution of the Russian Emperor and his ministers, they have on more than one occasion afforded England an opportunity of taking"], [33, "WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XXIX a decided step to check them. Similar openings may again offer, and if, then, Russia should not be in possession of such points as would preclude the possi bility of English interference, and if Turkey should be willing to receive as her aUy, a power which honestly seeks to be the means of her preservation, instead of one that is obviously interested in her destruction, the change might be effected by simply opening the straits of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus for the passage of an English fleet. Should Turkey, however, be blind to her own inter est, and should she, in distrust of England, adhere to Russia, the first hostUe or offensive act, either of Russia or of Turkey, should be followed by the Enghsh taking immediate possession of the islands of Tenedos and Lemnos, and holding them as places of rendezvous for their fleets. From these points they might not only watch the Turkish and Russian ships, that would pro bably be stationed in the DardaneUes, but might also check their operations. It may be a question, whether possession should not likewise be taken of Smyrna. If the Russian fleet has actually moved to the DardaneUes, it is to be hoped that until this act is satisfactorily explained, the English Admiral wiU take steps to secure the above-mentioned islands; and as a further measure for counteracting any hostile project of Russia, a large number of war steamers should be added to our Mediterranean fleet. But supposing a firm alliance to be established between England and Turkey, which is the manifest interest of both parties, then England should not only endeavour to improve the condition of the Turkish navy, but also to place the army on a better footing. After the destruction of the Janissaries, Mahmoud"], [34, "XXX POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND determined that the new military force should adopt the European dress and tactics. He found, however, that the Mahometans entertained such a repugnance to these innovations, that he was driven to the necessity of enrolling none but very young men, whose prejudices in favour of the former system, he naturally concluded, could not be deep rooted, and he merely retained a small number of old soldiers to incorporate with the new levies which were raised by conscription, and chiefly in Asia Minor. The French system of field movements was the one selected for the Turkish infantry, and officers who had retired from the French service were appointed to be the instructors. This selection was very unfortunate, as the French system seems to be much less suited to the character and peculiarities of the Turkish people, than either that of the English or of the Prussians. It is generally admitted that although French soldiers have not that degree of steadiness in theh mUitary movements, which is common to the troops of England and Prussia, this deficiency is in a great measure coun terbalanced by their inteUigence and alacrity ; but the Turk, who does not possess these qualities to the same extent, has others that are not less valuable in the sol dier, and which adapt him for acquiring that steadiness under arms, and that knowledge of details, that are con sidered indispensable in the English service. These are zeal, diligence, and habits of great attention, when under instruction. \u00ab Marshal Marmont has told us, that in Turkey there is but one class, and that the sons of the Vizier, and those of the carrier of water have the same education.* As a consequence of this state of things not only the Vide page 9."], [35, "WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XXXI private soldiers, but also the superior officers, are taken from among the mass of the people, the latter being selected sometimes in consequence of their higher attainments, but more frequently according to the caprice of those in authority. Here is one great cause of the present defective state of the Turkish army ; and if it be an evil to appoint incompetent persons to situ ations of responsibility, it is no less so to remove the deserving from such posts from mere prejudice and caprice. This, however, is so frequently the case in the Turkish service, that the officers never feel secure in then- positions, and therefore neither acquire confidence in themselves, nor the respect of their men. So long as this mode of treating the officers may continue, the Turkish army can never attain to any great degree of exceUence. The first step towards placing it on a proper footing, wiU therefore be to educate the officers, and to give them a certainty of retaining their rank during good conduct. This can only be done by the adoption of a sound and rational military code, in which amongst other enactments it should be declared that an officer will not be liable, under any pretence, to be removed, or otherwise degraded, or punished, excepting by the award of a court of his peers ; and that even the highest authority shall have no power to increase the sentence of this court. A school of mutual instruction, on the Lancasterian system, has been estabbshed for the army, from which much good may be expected to result, but in order to give greater value to this institution, the students should be divided into classes. By this means young men of very decided talent might be advanced to a supe rior class, to be educated for the duties of officers ; and during theh progress through this higher class, they"], [36, "XXXII POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND would, owing to their acquirements, ensure the respect of the body from whom they had been separated.* By thus obtaining an educated class of men for the rank of officers, by paying them well, and by making promotion in their inferior regimental grades depend entirely upon merit, and in the superior regimental sta tions on seniority, a great step towards the formation of a respectable army woidd be taken. It is therefore to be hoped that should the English Government possess, or hereafter acquire, influence with the Porte, it will be exercised in bringing about this improvement. It would be undoubtedly a work of time to give the superior officers of the Turkish army a knowledge of the art of war on a grand scale, but this would be less necessary if a close aUiance were entered into between England and Turkey, for in that case the latter would have the assistance of the best officers of the former power. The object of present importance is, therefore, the training of the men, and if adequately provided with intelligent instructors from the British service, there can be no question, that in four or five months the Turkish infantry might be put into good fighting order. It is not contended that in this space of time they could be taught to man\u0153uvre with aU the pre cision or the celerity of the English, the Prussian, br the French army ; but from the aptitude of the Turks for acquiring a knowledge of military details, we may feel assured that they would be rendered expert in the use of the musket, and capable of performing with suf ficient accuracy those movements which are usuaUy required in the day of battle. * It is not that promotion amongst the officers by selection according to -merit is not approved as a general principle, but it is deprecated as a system for Turkey, where favouritism and not merit would be the ground on which the officer would be advanced."], [37, "WITH TURKEY AND RUSSIA. XXXIII The Turkish cavahy have adopted the system of field movements of the French cavahy. This has been very judicious, because in the French service steadiness and order are considered as great essentials for the cavahy, and therefore the system is well suited to the Turks. The horses of the Turkish cavalry are strong and active, and, though not large, they have more bone than Arab horses, and are admirably calculated for light cavahy. The Sultan is so imbued with the deshe of change that he often pushes it to an excess. ' The general change of dress is one instance of this; and another, though perhaps of minor importance, is presented by his adoption of saddles of the European style for his cavahy ; for as they afford a much less secure seat than the Turkish saddle, and totaUy alter the national system of riding, the instruction of the recruit is much retarded. The artiUery are the best soldiers in the Turkish army, and notwithstanding the defective nature of the carriages, they work theh guns with great dexterity. The instruction of the Turkish soldiers is carried on in a nhld and explanatory manner ; harshness towards them is indeed unnecessary, as the men are naturaUy orderly and weU disposed, and evince great anxiety to acquire a knowledge of theh duties. Owing to their habits of sobriety, offences against discipline are not frequent. For those of a common character the sol diers are hable to be caned, and for crimes of a graver nature they are subject to the same punishment as would be inflicted on civilians. Having carefully reviewed the circumstances con nected with the present state of Turkey, we feel war- b 3"], [38, "XXXIV POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND. ranted in the conclusion that her army and navy may be put upon a very respectable footing ; that England is of aU powers the most able to assist her in effecting these objects; that England is also the most interested in effecting them ; that from her interference Turkey has nothing to fear, and everything to hope ; and lastly, that no other power can fairly impugn the motives of England. The complete subjection of Syria to the Sultan's rule would tend in so great a degree to secure the independence of the Turkish empire, that it may be considered a'n object to which the best efforts of England should be directed ; and it should be borne in mind that if Russia be prevented from becoming the mistress of Turkey, it must be chiefly through the influence or power of England. Much has been said, and much has been written, calculated to create despondency in the mind of the British public, on account of the supposed numerical superiority of the fleets of other nations ; but we will express our opinion upon this point in the words of a writer in the Quarterly Review,* who says, \" We must confess we are not of those who dream that our navy is quite in a desperate state. Other countries may be building ships \u2014 so much the better * \u2014 British blue jackets must be very much altered, if in the event of a war, they are not building them for us.\" In short, we have no apprehensions that the British navy wiU not speedily rise to its former state of pre-eminence, when ever its services may be required. * No. 126, page 340."], [39, "ON THE POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND WITH TURKEY, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA. WRITTEN FOR THE SECOND EDITION OF THE TRANSLATION OF MARSHAL MARMONT'S WORK ON THE TURKISH EMPIRE, PUBLISHED IN 1854. In the article on the pohtical relations of England with Turkey and Russia, written for the first edition, and pubhshed in 1839, we ventured to differ from the opinion expressed by Marshal Marmont, as well as from that of the Marquis of Londonderry, both of whom argued to prove that the Emperor of Russia had no aggressive intentions towards Turkey. We also ven tured to predict that the Czar would attempt to carry out, at the earliest practicable moment, the intentions which we believed him then to entertain. The events of the last twelve months have com pletely fulfiUed our predictions ; and unexpected cir cumstances have brought to hght the important fact, that Nicholas has long contemplated and preconcerted the arrangements he is now striving to accomplish. When Marshal Marmont wrote the journal of his tour in Turkey, and when we translated his work, it did not enter into the Marshal's calculations that the firm"], [40, "XXXVI POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND ally of England, in resisting the encroachments of the Emperor of Russia, would be the French nation; it never entered into the calculations of Nicholas, nor was this happy circumstance ever contemplated by either Austria or Prussia. The sagacity of English statesmen in cultivating a strict, an honourable, and a disinterested alliance with France, and the wisdom and straightforwardness of the Emperor Napoleon in entering with cordiality and frankness into that aUiance, have baffled aU the schemes of Russian subtlety, and have astonished the German Courts; and the result will prove, that this union, formed with such nobleness of purpose, and which wiU be carried through with such singleness of purpose, will render these two powers of colossal strength, both physicaUy and morally, the arbitrers of the world. War is now (April, 1854) declared, and the armies of France and England have aheady commenced theh disembarkation on the shores of European Turkey. The combined Mediterranean fleets have doubtless, before this, confined the Russian Euxine fleet within the harbour of Sebastopol, and the northern fleets of the aUies have the entire command of the Baltic Sea. It may not be unprofitable to consider what might have been the probable consequences had the allies at an earlier period cut the knot of diplomacy, by declaring in the summer of 1853, that if the Russians did not then retire from the Principalities, they would consider their refusal as a cams belli. In the first place, would Austria and Prussia, under such a state of things, have sided with France and England, and adopted theh course ? Assuming, how ever, that they would have entered into this understand ing, we ask, were France and England in a state of"], [41, "XXXVII WITH TURKEY, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA. preparation to act instantly and vigorously both by sea and land against Russia? or, would their threat have been for a time, at least, a mere brutum fulmen ? There can be but little doubt that England could not for some months have brought into the field a military force adequate to the emergency, and France hkewise required further time for preparation ; this both have gained, by the delay on the part of their governments in bringing matters to extremity. Neither England nor France had a fleet for the Baltic tiU very lately, and if we are to beheve the statements of common report, Russia had during the whole of last summer in the Baltic ports some twenty-five sail of the line, manned and armed, and fit for sea. If, therefore, war had been prematurely declared, the Russians would have embarked a sufficient force, which was then in the Crimea, to capture and hold the forts on the shores of the DardaneUes, so as to prevent the entrance of the Mediterranean fleets into the Black Sea ; and it is a question whether the Rus sians might not have crossed the Danube and moved forward against Constantinople, partly by land and partly by means of theh fleet, before we could have taken any useful step for the defence of the Turkish Empire. Even Austria had not then an army prepared to act on the right flank of an invading Russian force, and Prussia is too remote from the theatre of action to have become physicaUy a check on Russia at that early period. In the meanwhUe the Russian Baltic fleet would have been unopposed for several months, and during that time the Russian Government would, either by cajolery or intimidation, have forced Denmark and"], [42, "XXXVIII POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND Sweden into an aUiance with her, and she might have blockaded the Prussian ports. Would the movements of this fleet have stopped there ? Might not our own coasts have been threatened, and perhaps a successful descent made on some of our great arsenals ? But let us take the other side of the question, and let us suppose that Austria and Prussia had, in conse quence of a premature declaration of war on our part, altogether withdrawn from our conferences. What a moral influence would not that have had on the whole question? Would it not have shaken the faith of the people of France and the people of Eng land in the discretion and judgment of their respective Governments, and would not the war in which we are now engaged have been the reverse of that popular war which it has been rendered by the very reluctance of their two Governments to enter into it? and would not that very circumstance have given confidence to the Russian Government, and inclined the nobles, and the merchants, and even the serfs of Russia to regard with less dissatisfaction the war which is about to cripple theh resources, destroy their trade, and bring burthens on the whole population wliich they are very incapable of supporting. But let us now take the worst alternative ; that is, that Austria and Prussia had stated that until all hope vanished in their respective Cabinets of bringing Russia to reason they could not consent to break off negotia tions; and that if France and England precipitated matters by a declaration of war, unless the Princi palities were forthwith evacuated, such a proceeding would compel Austria and Prussia to side with Russia. France and England would then, it may be safely"], [43, "WITH TURKEY, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA. XXXIX argued, have been unable to declare war, for they were unprepared for it on such conditions. They might, it is true, have got the command of the Black Sea, but on the other hand they might have been too late to obtain this object, without which the success of the Allies would be impossible, for the Russian Government would have been grossly culpable if, the moment they received our ultimatum, they had not taken possession of the defences of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus, and thus effectually shut us out from the Euxine. France could not then have prudently despatched troops to Turkey, as she would have exposed herself to attack on a long hne of frontier; and with a war that under these suppositions would in all proba bility have been exceedingly unpopular in France, opportunities would have been given for cabals which might have endangered the present order of things in that country. England having no fleet at the time ready for the Baltic, must have looked to her own coasts; and thus whUe the armies of both the aUied Western Powers would have been, as it were, temporarily paralyzed, the subjugation of Turkey by Russia and Austria would have been comparatively an easy operation. Although we could, and in all probability we should, under such circumstances, have shaken the tottering power of Austria tiU it had crumbled into ruins, and although France and England combined would have taken signal vengeance on Prussia, by means which need riot here be detailed, yet in the meanwhile Turkey would have faUen, and Russia would have thus obtained the object of her long and scarcely hidden ambition. However, while these observations are intended to"], [44, "XL POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND show, that in aU probability we are now in at least as favourable a position as if we had declared war many months back, it is more to the purpose to consider the probable course and consequences of the war in which we are now unavoidably engaged; and before doing this, we will venture to say, that although a different course of proceeding on the part of the Cabinets of France and England might for a longer time have deferred this war, we believe that no course they could have taken would have altogether averted it ; and that France and England were never, and are never likely to be, better prepared for the contest. Let, then, no promises from the Russian Govern ment induce them to come to any arrangement that shall not bring the matter in dispute to a final and, if possible, an unalterable settlement. That the fleets and the armies of the two aUied nations wiU be uni formly successful wherever they encounter the enemy, we cannot permit ourselves to doubt; but theh object must be, not only to gain victories, but to gain such victories as will cripple the aggressive power of the Russian despot. The means of again disturbing the peace of Europe, for merely selfish objects, must be taken from him; and the sword, which he has compeUed us to draw, must not be sheathed untU we have entitled ourselves to sufficient material guarantees from a government from whom no other guarantee can with reliance be accepted. We must have no half measures; and the most fatal course for the Governments of the aUies to adopt, and the most deplorable in its results for theh countries, would be, for the sake of present peace, to patch up this quarrel, which has been brought on by the despotic wiU of one man."], [45, "XLI WITH TURKEY, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA. Nicholas feels that England could not have a cause more urgently demanding her interference, and that she is never likely to have a more firm and intimate alliance than that which now connects her with the chivalrous people who are her nearest neighbours, and who, we trust, wiU henceforward be her best and truest friends. He may, therefore, try to temporize, seeing the de termined attitude the Western Powers have assumed ; for he cannot now entertain much confidence in the prospects of success. Although hitherto he has been checked by Turkey alone, we do not pretend, that in the present campaign the Turkish army could, single handed, successfully resist the advance of the Russian army on Constan tinople, notwithstanding, that doubtless, gaUant actions would be fought. But a combined army, mustering at least 100,000 of the best troops of France and England, we regard to be invincible. The soldiers of those gaUant armies are in the highest state of disci pline, in the highest state of organization, and in the best state of equipment;* and this addition to the Turkish army, whenever it can be brought into the field, must turn the scale in its favour.

They should strike and not parry, and their first victory wUl go far to ensure complete success. We may question whether the system of Omar Pacha is the most judicious, if, as it is represented, he be attempting the defence of the Danube in an extent of 200 miles of its course, by an army which on paper does not probably exceed 200,000 men ; for he wiU be liable to have his force cut up in detail if the enemy should in large numbers cross and defeat one of his corps. Surely a more retired position, where he could bring his whole force to bear on any portion of the Russian army that may have crossed the river, would be a safer system, unless his espionage is so perfect as to ensure to him accurate information of the move ments of the enemy. But with the combined armies of Turkey, France, and England, we may expect to hear of the offensive being taken, and of the Principalities being cleared during the ensuing summer. But then comes the second great question, how are we afterwards to deal with our enemy? shall we be strong enough to follow him across the Pruth, unless Austria is with us ? and if we do not, can we prudently remain in the Principalities during the winter, and if so, for what period? and wUl not Russia re-enter so soon as we shall have withdrawn, unless the Turkish army can safely occupy these countries? A war of many campaigns on this stale-mating principle might be drawn on, exhausting the finances of Turkey, and perhaps of Russia also, and draining heavilv the resources of the Western Powers. To avoid such a state of things, we should strike heavy blows at once and at ant cost, and thus throw Russia back for half a century at least."], [47, "AVITH TURKEY, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA. XLIII The Crimea must be taken from him; Sebastopol and the Russian fleet must be captured and destroyed. Circassia and Georgia must be cleared of every Russian soldier. Russian external sea-borne commerce must be entirely closed, and thus, obstinate though the Emperor may be, a state of dissatisfaction will be eventually produced throughout his dominions, which must force him to sue for peace, or bend to a revolution which may cost him his crown. Such terms must be imposed upon Russia as wiU fetter her power for centuries. The Black Sea must be free to aU the Western navies ; and Russia must be debarred from having a single ship of war on its waters.

Ministers should estimate this cost actually by the day, if they intend rightly to husband our resources : and so calculating they wiU at once discover that true economy points at the immediate employment by France and England of such overwhelming forces, as shall leave to the enemy not a chance of success.

Why should the forces employed be limited to that which may be con sidered barely sufficient for the purpose ?"], [48, "XLIV POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND Such is the system of raising the military force in France, that an increase of the army of that power is simple and certain, and reduces itself into a mere question of expense. But in Great Britain, the enrolment being exclusively by voluntary acts on the part of the popula tion, there is less facility in suddenly effecting a rapid and considerable increase of the army. It may, how ever, be accomplished by various means : first, by lower ing the standard ; not by half inches or quarters of an inch, but by two inches at once. The present standard is 5 feet 5-1- inches. Let it be reduced to 5 feet 4 inches, or even to 5 feet 3 inches, for a limited number of men, and let corps of Chasseurs and Voltigeurs be formed of the men so raised, and let theh enlistment be for three years. We know what the Voltigeur of the first Napoleon's army was in stature and efficiency; and if lightly weighted, such men in our service may be rendered most valuable riflemen and light infantry. In five or six months an additional force of 8000 or 10,000 men of this description may be raised, and trained, and conveyed to the field of action. Nothing can be more simple and certain than this. Then, let a foreign legion be raised, of Swiss, Pied montese, Spaniards, or Portuguese, to be commanded by English officers. Why should not corps of Egyptians, also to be com manded by English officers, be formed ? and not to multiply suggestions, we wUl conclude by remarking, that a considerable force might be obtained by giving permanent rank to militia officers, on condition of theh raising for the line certain specified numbers of men from theh respective regiments. This question must be looked at full in the face. We have an obstinate and dogged enemy to beat ; and"], [49, "WITH TURKEY, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA. XLV i whether we regard the matter on the score of humanity or of economy, we must not be sparing of expense. True humanity consists, not in employing the smallest number of men likely to effect the desired object, for that would leave no alternative to brave enemies like the Russians but fighting to the last ; but we should send such forces into the field as wiU overpower those enemies, and thus pave the way for their retreating without dishonour, and without tarnishing their mili tary fame. While we do not wish to underrate the prowess of the Russian soldier, or the skill of his officer, yet we think that both are over-estimated; and we believe, that with anything like an equality of numbers, crushing victories will be obtained by the allied army. The Russian soldiers of this day will find, obsti nate as we believe them to be, that they cannot stand up against the impetuosity and the bravery of the French soldier, or compete with the skill of the French officer ; and we believe also, that the Russians have no idea of the power of endurance on the day of action, or the indomitable courage of the British soldier; of his awful rush to the charge, or his terrific hand-to-hand fighting. We have therefore no apprehension as to the result ; but we desire to see nothing left to the chance of failure, and recommend both vigorous and prompt measures to place the requisite force in Turkey. There should be no more of the false economy of trying to do things at a cheap rate, by bargaining to obtain the lowest price. The Legislature should have been called upon to adopt such measures as would have enabled the Execu tive to take up the best and the swiftest steam vessels"], [50, "XLVI POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND wherever they could be found, for the conveyance of troops to the seat of war, leaving the question of price to be afterwards settled by a competent and fair tribunal of arbitration. Steamers alone should, for the future, be used for the conveyance of horses and stores, as well as for men, regardless of the first cost; for in this war time is almost everything. As we have before observed, we cannot pretend to know the arranged plan of the cam paign, but this we do know, that if we do not speedUy take the offensive, our enemy will, by action, disconcert all our best considered schemes; and how are we to take the field without cavahy and artUlery ? Without these two arms can we, except by giving an enormous advantage to an enemy, fight general actions? And surely, neither the French nor the British army should risk their infantry supported only by Turkish cavalry and Turkish artiUery. Let us hope, therefore, to hear no more of sailing transports being used for any part of our expeditionary force. What a saving of cost and of life might it not have been had there been sent such masses of troops as would have ensured the termination of the war in one campaign; but when will the French and Enghsh armies be in a state to fight a great and successful battle between Schumla and the Danube ? and if not very speedily, the war wiU assuredly be protracted to at least another campaign. It is quite true, that as Russia has entered the hsts not only against the two best armies in the world, but also against the two richest nations, she may be beaten by the mere failure of her resources, by our adopting a Fabian policy : but we trust this wUl not be our course ; for we shaU lose more men by disease, in pro-"], [51, "xlvii WITH TURKEY, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA. tracted warfare, than we should do by the sword in vigorous action, and we should give the enemy a degree of confidence to which he is not entitled. A power that has sacrificed little short of half a mU lion of soldiers in a war of thirty years only, against such a handful of men as the Chcassian army, and with so httle success, must be regardless of the sacrifice of human hfe. The Russian Emperor must be brought to reason by our successes, and by the consequent dis content of his people. But while we recommend energetic operations ashore we would give the opposite advice afloat. Let us in the Baltic blockade the ports of the enemy, and if it be wished bombard his towns ; but do not let us attack his formidable coast defences, unless a cer tainty of success presents itseh, and some great object is to be effected. In some few instances we may sUence shore batteries by the fire of our fleet, but if those of Cronstadt be as solidly constructed as we have reason to beheve they have been, and have been armed, as is supposed, with heavy sheU guns, and lastly, if they be weU manned, then any success wiU be dearly purchased by our fleets, unless our ships can get within three hundred yards of the forts. We must not calculate upon the success of wooden waUs against stone waUs by our good fortune at Algiers and Acre. These are instances of which we shah pro bably find no paraUel in the present war, for at Algiers we were allowed almost to run our ships' sides against the enemy's works, and at Acre, whatever damage was done by the fire of the fleet was to a waU in an exceedingly bad state of repair. In encounters where our ships of war are brought"], [52, "xlviii POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND into action against weU constructed forts and batteries, unless we succeed, after sUencing these works, in making some capture of much value to us, or in destroying some docks, arsenal, or work of great importance to the enemy, we must estimate our gain by looking at the relative cost of the repahs to our ships on the one side, and of the repairs to the coast defences on the other. In short, irrespective of the consideration of the loss of life, it becomes a commercial question ; and we shall be much surprised if we do not find that the object that may be gained has been purchased at too heavy a cost. If masonry waUs are to be breached by the fire from our fleet, there can be no question that the heavy guns of the English ships are well calculated for that pur pose if solid shot be used, but the hollow shot and the concussion sheU, it is beheved, wiU not be found effec tive in these operations, and, as we have already ob served, the range for breaching should not exceed three hundred yards. The effect of the concussion sheU in such action between ship and ship, or between a land battery and a ship, is as yet an unsolved problem ; and it appears to us most desirable, that a series of experiments on an extensive scale should be tried at various ranges, from three hundred to twelve hundred yards, to determine such points as the following : \u2014 At what range and with what charge will a concussion shell pass through a ship's side and explode between decks ? and at what range and with what charge wiU a concussion shell penetrate (without passing through) a ship's side, so that in exploding it will make a breach in the timbers ? The attention of the artillery and naval authorities is invited to this important matter."], [53, "XLIX WITH TURKEY, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA. The Baltic is not fruitful in instances of great success to the arms of England. In the late war our success was limited to the capture of one frigate by Sir Byam Martin, and we believe we lost four hne-of-battle ships which got on shore. We must not therefore calculate on gaining any striking victory in that quarter (although our steam ships will give us a great advantage in any operation the Allied Fleets may undertake) because the Russians wUl not expose theh fleet to risk a general action on anything like equal terms. A thorough blockade of the Russian ports is aU we have a right to expect from the Baltic Fleet, and this leads us to the con sideration of the liberal mode in which the French and English Governments have resolved to deal with the question of neutral bottoms. It is a course which does them honour, viewed in reference to the principle of in flicting as little injury as possible on commercial interests. But how wUl it effect the primary question of bring ing the Emperor of Russia to his senses, and how wiU it affect the duration of the war ? We have an enemy to contend with who may very successfully adopt a Fabian policy. Notwithstanding the extent of his frontier he is nowhere vulnerable, so long as Austria and Prussia do not take an active part in the war against him. If he cannot be successfully assaUed in the Baltic, and if we do not attack and capture Sebastopol or deprive him of the Crimea, we can positively venture on no enterprise of a character that shaU strike a decisive blow, if he gradually withdraws from the Prin cipalities and takes the Pruth for his hne of frontier. His commerce, though interrupted by direct Chan- s'"], [54, "L POLITICAL RELATIONS OF ENGLAND nels, will be open by channels circuitous and indirect, and so long as the producers in Russia find that by these means they are enabled to dispose of their pro duce, no pressure within of a commercial character wiU be used to force the Emperor to make terms with his enemies; but if the enlightened hberality and civi lization of the World would aUow the confiscation of every article of Russian produce coming to this country, and to France, whether in the raw or manufactured state, we should wield a weapon of moral influence, far more powerful to bring about a state of peace, than any armies or navies we could employ. We cannot refrain from here laying before our readers the last manifesto of the Emperor Nicholas; and though it may seem inconsistent to publish this state-paper in French, we feel that even the most accurate and literal translation might not give the fuU force of the original; and in a matter where even a phrase is of moment, no possibility of misconception should be aUowed to exist.

LI A quel titre les deux Puissances pretendaient-elles ainsi exiger tout d'une seule des deux parties belligerantes sans rien demander a l'autre ; c'est ce qu'elles n'ont point juge necessaire d'expliquer au Cabinet Imperial. Evacuer les Principautes, sans que l'ombre m\u00a7me des conditions, auxquelles l'Empereur avait subordonne la cessation de cette occupation temporaire, ait ete remplie par le Gouvernement Ottoman, les evacuer au fort d'une guerre que celui-ci a declaree le premier, quand il en poursuit avec activite les operations offensives, quand ses troupes occupent elles-memes un point fortifie du territoire Russe, etait deja une condition inadmissible pour le fond. Les deux Puissances ont voulu que, par la forme, elle devint plus inacceptable encore. Elles ont fixe au Cabinet Imperial, pour y adherer, un terme de six jours, au bout desquels un refus ou l'absence d'une reponse quelconque devaient etre, par elles, envisages comme equivalent a une decla ration de guerre. A une sommation aussi partiale dans sa teneur, aussi inexecu table pratiquement qu'elle etait insultante dans ses termes, le silence etait la seule reponse compatible avec la dignite de l'Empereur. En consequence, les deux Gouvernements viennent de faire connaitre publiquement, que la Russie, par son refus d'obtemperer a leur requisition, s'est constitute vis-k-vis d'eux dans un etat de guerre dont la responsabilite lui appartiendra en entier. En presence de pareilles declarations, il ne reste a l'Empereur qu'k accepter la situation qu'on lui fait, en se reservant d'employer tous les moyens que la Providence a mis entre ses mains pour defendre avec energie et Constance l'honneur, l'independance, et la securite de son empire. Independamment du message par lequel le Cabinet de Londres annonce aux deux Chambres sa resolution, il a expose, dans une declaration supplemental, les motifs qui l'engagent a prendre les armes, et recapitule l'origine et les incidents de la question. Le Gouvernement Imperial croit superflu de rentrer en discussion sur ce sujet. Toutes ses pieces precedentes lui paraissent avoir epuise la polemique.

L'occupation des Principautes, qu'on preud aujourd'hui apr&s coup pour pretexte de cette guerre, n'avait point empeche la negociation de s'ouvrir.

Ne pouvant fermer les yeux sur l'insuffisance des motifs d'une guerre desastreuse et sur le peu de proportion qui existe entre ses effets et sa cause, les deux Puissances sont obligees d'en exagerer l'objet, en formulant contre la Russie les accusations les plus vagues. Elles alleguent leur honneur et leurs interets materiels leses, nos projets d'agrandissement et de conquete en Turquie, l'inde pendance de la Porte, celle meme des autres etats, l'equilibre enfin de l'Europe que menacerait, suivant eux, notre preponde rance excessive."], [57, "WITH TURKEY, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA.

Marshal Marmont quitted Vienna on the 22nd AprU, 1834, to proceed on his tour, and, on reaching the confines of Hungary, took the road to Buda and Pesth. He passed through Raab and crossed the field of battle where, in 1809, the French army, under the orders of the Viceroy of Italy, defeated the Aus trians commanded by the Archduke John. He visited the establishments of the Hungarian studs, a descrip tion of which wUl be given hereafter, and on the 24th of AprU reached the celebrated fortress of Komorn, situated near the confluence of the Waag and the Danube. This fortress, when the Turks occupied Hungary, was on theh frontier. It has since that period been much strengthened by additional works, and would be found capable of a long resistance if it should ever be attacked. But, in the present state of the Austrian Emphe and of its relations with the neighbouring powers, such an event is not probable. B"], [66, "4 HUNGARY. garian plains, known by \"the name \" Puszta.\" These plains are not only uncultivated, but even without inha- bitants. They are traversed by roads which are not regularly formed, but are merely traced at the conve- nience or caprice of traveUers. The general character of the scenery is here extremely wild, and presents a striking contrast to that between Vienna and Buda. In continuing his journey, the Marshal at length arrived at the cultivated districts; but instead of finding the people dispersed, as in other agricultural countries, and inhabiting farm-houses, hamlets, and ordinary vil lages, he describes them as coUected together, to the number, in some instances, of even forty thousand, in vil lages of immense extent. In the spring, the whole of the males capable of working leave these vhlages, and encamp upon the land intended to be cultivated. Here they remain until it is ploughed and sowed, when they return to theh homes, and continue there tiU the period of har vest arrives. We may trace the origin of this singular custom to the necessity of mutual protection, arising out of the contests between the Christians and the Turks, of which this country was formerly the great theatre. For it was only by coUecting themselves together in large bodies that the inhabitants could find security against the predatory excursions of either party. On the 26th AprU, the Marshal passed through Soroksar, Ocsa, CErkeny, and Kets-Kemet; the only places in which he saw inhabitants in journeying over a space of thirty leagues. At Kets-Kemet he found a population of thhty-eight thousand souls. Although the country he traversed on this day's journey is of great fertility, yet, from the total want of shelter, the"], [67, "HUNGARY. 5 crops are subject to be destroyed by violent storms with which this district is occasionally visited \u2014 an evU which might probably be remedied by enclosing the cultivated land with belts of trees. On the foUowing day he passed through Tsongrad and Szentes, the former inhabited by thirty thousand, and the latter by ten thousand peasants. He halted for the day at Mezo-Hegyes, the Austrian establish ment for improving the breed of horses. An idea may be formed of its magnitude, by merely stating that the land appropriated to it is fifteen leagues in chcuit. It is surrounded by a broad and deep ditch, and is sheltered by a wide plantation of trees. When the Austrian cavalry was supphed with horses exclusively from this estabhshment, there were no less than twenty thousand colts here. But the object of the Govern ment is now merely to breed stallions, both at this place and at Bobolna, for the provincial depots, where a total number is kept up of nearly two thousand. This is effected by means of an annual supply from aU the government establishments, towards which Mezo- Hegyes contributes two hundred and fifty. For this purpose one thousand brood mares and forty-eight stallions are kept there. In the operations of husbandry there are employed two hundred mares and six hundred oxen, with three hundred and sixty ploughs. When the provincial depots have received theh fuU complement of young horses, the surplus is either sold, or sent as remounts to the cavahy. At present the stock of stallions, brood mares, and foals at Mezo- Hegyes amounts to three thousand. The whole of this estabhshment is under the direction of an officer with the rank of Major, who is assisted by two sub-"], [68, "6 HUNGARY. alterns, and has under his command eleven hundred and seventy men. The advantage of the Austrian system is, that not only a very superior description of horse is obtained for the cavalry, but that the breed is improved throughout the whole country. On the 29th AprU the author continued his route, crossing the Maros at a place caUed Arad. Here the soil is more fertile, and more highly cultivated. The general aspect of the country also changes, for the immense villages which have been aUuded to are no longer met with, but are succeeded by farm-houses and viUages of ordinary extent. The population is com posed of German colonists, who retain the manners and industrious habits of their nation. The next place of importance he reached was Te mesvar, which is a regular fortress, composed of ten bastions, with numerous outworks. It is built on the banks of the Temes, and near the navigable canal which unites the Maros with the Theiss. Although Temesvar is the central point of defence of the Hun garian frontier, it is unlikely that it wall ever be required as a protection to this country; for in the event of a war between Russia and Austria, the contest between these powers would probably take place on the frontiers of Poland and SUesia. On the 30th, Marshal Marmont proceeded to Karan sebes, the head-quarters of the frontier regiments of IUyria. In the year 1809, when the Marshal was made Governor- General of the IUyrian provinces, which had been ceded to the French, the six regiments belonging to this territory were under his command. It was by his advice that Napoleon decided on maintaining the"], [69, "HUNGARY. 7 system under which they were organized, although urged by other officers to break it up ; and the gaUant conduct of these troops during the war justified the favourable opinion which the Marshal had formed of them. The system adverted to and the circumstances which led to its adoption are not unworthy of notice. The long wars between the Hungarians and Turks having devastated this frontier district, and reduced its popiUation to the greatest state of misery, it became necessary to devise some means for ameliorating its condition. A mUitary organization appearing to be the best arrangement for effecting this object, the whole of the inhabitants were enrolled and formed into companies and regiments, to which certain tracts of country were assigned. In the first instance the quantity of land aUotted to each famUy was in proportion to its numbers, and subsequently a further grant was made to those whose industry or superior system of cultivation entitled them to such a reward. Landed property was on no occasion vested in an individual, but in the enthe family, whose chief directed the whole of the operations as in patriarchal times, and kept the accounts, which were audited at certain periods of each year. The net proceeds of the industry of every famUy were then divided among its members, the chief receiving two shares. The Government levied a smaU tax upon the land, to be applied towards the support of the troops, and the defraying of the expenses of the civil administration of the district, the deficiency being made up from the general revenue of the kingdom. The amount of the tax was determined not merely in"], [70, "8 FRONTIER REGIMENTS. proportion to the extent, but also with reference to the fertility of the land ; and it was optional with the pro prietors, either to pay the impost in money or in labour, on the estates which remained in the possession of the Government. The population was required to guard the frontier at all times, and also to furnish during war the number of troops that might be demanded by the Government. It therefore became necessary to adopt such an organ ization and system of discipline, that notwithstanding the inhabitants were scattered over a great extent of country, a weU trained and efficient mUitary force might be coUected whenever rendered necessary by the exigencies of the state. The district assigned to each regiment is accurately marked out, and a record is kept of its boundaries in a general register, which is so arranged, as to show on inspection not only the amount due for taxes, from the whole body, but even from each individual composing it. Every member of the regiment is furnished with a book, in which an officer of his company inscribes an extract from the general register, showing the amount of his particular debt. In time of war every regiment is required to send into the field four battahons, of twelve hundi-ed men each ; and even during peace two battahons, composed of the most disposable men, pro properly armed and equipped, are always ready to march. The individuals belonging to these battalions, remain however with theh famUies until they assemble for the purpose of instruction, or are called upon for more active duties. Each soldier is required to serve in an effective regiment for a period of twelve years, after which he is enrolled in the reserve. The men furnish, from the wool of theh flocks, the"], [71, "FRONTIER REGIMENTS. 9 materials for their uniforms, which are made up in theh respective famUies ; credit for the value of these clothes being given to them, as a set-off against the tax due for their land. Certain officers are appointed to regulate aU the details of these arrangements, as well as to direct the agricultural operations. They fix not only the amount of land to be ploughed, of grain to be sown, and of animals to be slaughtered, but also the quantity of corn to be put into store for each famUy, as a provision against a time of scarcity. The whole of the country aUotted to the regiments is visited once a fortnight by subordinate officers, who report their observations to the Colonel, and this chief makes a general inspection once during the year. The pecu niary affairs of each regiment are conducted by a finance committee, composed of three officers, whose accounts are audited at certain periods by a commissary of the brigade to which it belongs. There is in each company a military tribunal, called the Court of Session, instituted for the purpose of administering justice in minor cases, which is thus obtained promptly and without expense. It is com posed of a lieutenant, a serjeant-major, two serjeants, two corporals, and two heads of families, who assemble once a week. The efforts of this tribunal are in the first instance directed to produce a reconciliation between the htigants, and it does not pronounce an award until these attempts prove to be unsuccessful. The award is not valid untU confirmed by the captain. Although the impartiality of the Court of Session is free from suspicion, yet its members may naturally be supposed to be deficient in intelligence, and therefore a higher tribunal has been estabbshed to take cognizance of civU matters of a graver or more important cha- ts 3"], [72, "10 FRONTIER REGIMENTS. racter. This higher tribunal is composed of two Offi cers and an auditor. The latter, although of the legal profession, is obliged to bear a military title, and wear a uniform, in order to insure respect in this country, where everything has a mUitary character. The officers sign the minutes of the evidence, and the Auditor pro nounces the verdict. The offences of criminals who are not enroUed in the army, are tried by the Court of Session ; but for the trial of those who are enrolled, a mUitary court is convened, composed of the chief of a battalion, an auditor,* two captains, two serjeant majors, two serjeants, two corporals, and two privates. As an additional protection to the accused, the sen tence cannot be carried into effect until it has been approved by the colonel, who is not permitted in any case to sit as president of the court. Such are the principal features of the Frontier MUitary Force. This extraordinary institution, which is supposed to have been founded by Sigismund, King of Hungary, was improved by Prince Eugene, and perfected by Marshal Lascy. It not only has a tendency to advance the pro gress of civilization, and to increase the weh'are and prosperity of the people, but it enables the Government to draw from them the largest contribution to the exigencies of the state, that theh condition admits of. The most extraordinary part however of this system is, that it insures the defence of a very extensive frontier, at a comparatively smaU expense. For it enables the country to furnish seven or eight times the number of soldiers, that any district of the same extent, but under a different management, could supply. This wiU be better understood when it is stated that the average * The auditor occupies a corresponding position to that of the judge advocate in the British service."], [73, "11 HUNGARY. proportion of the population from which each regiment is raised and recruited, in Austria, is 400,000 indi viduals, whereas each of these frontier regiments is supphed from a population of only 50,000. At Karansebes, we are reminded of the lamentable catastrophe that befel the troops of Austria, near this place, in the latter wars between that power and Turkey. Joseph the Second afforded on this occasion a remark able instance of the misfortunes which a monarch may bring upon his people by overrating his qualifications as a mUitary commander; for though personally brave, he seemed, when the hves of others depended on his decision, to be deficient in that moral courage and pre sence of mind which are indispensable in a General; yet he evinced great resolution, as weU as indefatigable industry in conducting the civU affairs of the state, and unquestionably possessed superior talent. His political acts have been the subject of much discussion; how far they may be deserving of praise or censure this is not the place to inquire ; but it is impossible to deny that the views of this monarch were directed to promoting the welfare of his country. By moving in advance of public opinion, and by promptly effecting those changes in the national institutions which the circumstances of the times seemed to demand, he nipped in the bud, so far as his own dominions were concerned, the revolutions that threatened Austria as weU as the rest of Europe. In 1789, Joseph, having coUected together 80,000 men, for the purpose of attacking the Turks, established his camp near Karansebes. The Turks were in a posi tion opposite to the Austrian army, and so placed as to cover the province of Walachia. AU was prepared for the attack ; the generals were assembled in the tent of"], [74, "12 HUNGARY. the Emperor to receive their orders, and everything ap peared to promise success to the Austrian army ; but Joseph, feeling a degree of disquietude respecting the result, asked Marshal Lascy if he felt sure of beating the enemy. The Marshal replied, as any sensible man would have done under simdar circumstances, that he expected victory, but that he could not absolutely gua rantee it. Unhappdy this answer so discouraged Joseph, that he immediately abandoned the intention of attack ing the Turks, and resolved to retire behind the Temes. The plan of retreat was arranged, and the army was formed in parallel columns ; the infantry being placed in the centre, the cavalry on the flanks, and the bag gage in the intervals. The Austrians commenced their march at midnight, but shortly afterwards Marshal Lascy discovered that the order had not been issued for withdrawing the piquets of the left wing, supplied the omission, and suddenly halted the main body to wait for these detachments. The word of command to halt was given and repeated in the usual manner ; but being mistaken for the word \" Allah,\" which the Turks are in the habit of shouting when about to fall upon their enemies, many of the Austrian troops believed that they were attacked. This was the case with the drivers of the tumbrils, who, seized with panic, put their horses into a trot, in the hope of escaping, The infantry, sup posing the noise made by these carriages to be caused by the charge of the enemy, commenced firing in aU directions. The havoc they thus created in their own ranks was so great, that no less than 10,000 men are said to have been killed and wounded during the dark ness of the night. At day-light the mistake was dis covered, and the Austrian army then retreated to the position the Emperor had intended to take up behind"], [75, "HUNGARY. 13 the Temes. If, instead of giving way to his alarm, Joseph had attacked the enemy, it is probable that he would have obtained possession of Walachia without losing more than 3000 or 4000 men. As it was, he not only lost 10,000 by the disaster above mentioned, and 20,000 by sickness, which was the consequence of a prolonged occupation of an unhealthy tract of country, but he raised the courage of the Turks, and thereby deprived his own troops of the confidence they had pre viously reposed both in him and in themselves. From Karansebes, Marshal Marmont proceeded to Orsova, on the banks of the Danube. Although at present a miserable town it is likely to be much ex tended, as the principal Lazaretto for the purification of merchandize and persons coming from the Black Sea has been established here. The free navigation of the river, at a short distance below the town, has hitherto been impeded by a bar, or more properly speaking, by rapids. It is now pro posed to overcome the difficulty thus occasioned by the formation of a canal, to be united to the river both above and below the obstruction. The length of this canal would not exceed a thousand yards, and two locks would suffice to make it navigable. The Emperor of Austria is very desirous to carry this project into effect; but as the canal must be formed on the right bank of the river, and within the Turkish territory, it cannot be done without the Sultan's permission, which hitherto it has been found impossible to obtain. A simdar work would be required about ten leagues above Orsova. On the completion of both, the Danube would become navigable from Vienna to the sea, which would essen tially promote the wealth and prosperity of Hungary, and it is calculated that the voyage from Vienna to"], [76, "14 TRANSYLVANIA. Constantinople might then be made in twelve days. At present, from a want of facilities for export, the produce of this kingdom is of comparatively little value to its owners; but if the navigation of the Danube were rendered certain, this produce would be much enhanced, as it would then be conveyed to France and Italy, at a small expense. The contemplated improvement would even facilitate the communication with India by Tre bizond. On one of the islands of the Danube there is a fortress in possession of the Turks, caUed New Orsova, which, if in good repair and properly garrisoned, would com mand the navigation of the river, at this point. From Orsova the Marshal proceeded to the baths of Mahedia, which retain the celebrity they acquired in the time of the Romans. They are stdl considered very efficacious and are much frequented. He afterwards returned to Karansebes, whence he finally set out on the 4th of May, to continue his journey. He passed through the town of Deva, situated in the valley of the Maros. This valley, and indeed the greater part of Transylvania, has an appearance of fertility, but yet it is asserted that even with the most judicious sys tem of culture, it is far from being productive. The Maros, which is the largest river of the princi pality, passes through a country rich in ores, and, in a remarkable manner, seems to form a line of separation between the several metals. Thus on the right bank there are mines of gold and of sdver, and on the left of iron, lead, and copper. The castle of Deva is beautifully situated, majestically towering over the vaUey, and forming an almost impreg nable place of security. The population of the principality of Transylvania is"], [77, "15 TRANSYLVANIA. composed of a great diversity of people, who are distinct in origin, and speak different languages. There are 250,000 Hungarians, 1,000,000 Walachians, 500,000 Germans, 150,000 Szeklers, and 120,000 Ar menians, making a total of upwards of 2,000,000. The state however only recognizes the distinctions of Hun garians, Szeklers, and Germans. The Hungarians and Szeklers have at various times conquered this country, but its ancient inhabitants were Walachians, whose descent has been traced to the Roman colonists established here by Trajan. This province has for its defence four frontier regi ments of infantry, and a regiment of hussars. The adjoining Turkish provinces of Walachia and Moldavia being comparatively but little known, it may be weU to make some slight mention of them. The population of both these provinces, like that of Transylvania, is of Walachian origin, being descended from the Roman colonists and the ancient occupiers of the land. The only foreigners that have intermixed with them are Hungarians, who inhabit about 60 villages in Mol davia. Bessarabia, whicb is only separated from Moldavia by the Pruth, is also inhabited by Walachians of Roman origin. It is remarkable that these three provinces, encircled as they are by people of Sclavonian descent, should have so long retained a population which remains distinct in race and insulated from the sur rounding multitudes, who during centuries have never ceased to make encroachments on the south of Europe. The population of Moldavia is about 1,000,000, and that of Walachia, 2,000,000, amongst which there are said to be no fewer than 100,000 gipsies. Both the principalities of Walachia and Moldavia"], [78, "16 TRANSYLVANIA. are highly picturesque and beautiful; and are celebrated for the variety of their productions, and for the excel lence and number of their cattle, which they largely export. The Moldavian horses, in particular, are con sidered to be of a very superior breed. The principal towns of Walachia are Bucharest, Giorgewo, Tergovista, Galaz, and Bralnlow. The central and southern parts of this province are less mountainous than the northern, and contain valleys of great fertility, which are however very imperfectly cultivated. This is the natural consequence of mis government; for the inhabitants of a country where property is insecure, are seldom disposed to produce more than their necessities absolutely demand. On leaving Deva on the 6th of May, to proceed to Herrmanstadt, the Marshal inspected the field of battle of Szasvaros. The Turks were marching from Hun gary, and on reaching this spot they found the Hunga rian army occupying a position covered by a rivulet. They attacked the Hungarians with great impetuosity, but were repulsed and pursued into the plain, where they were completely defeated. Marshal Marmont gives it as his opinion that there is but one way of successfully contending with tbe Turks. This is to endeavour to resist their first onset; and if successful in that resistance, to become the assadants, and immediately attack their position. In the neighbourhood of Herrmanstadt, which is in the vaUey of the Aluta, the villages are extremely beautiful, and cultivation has in that district been brought to a state of great perfection. The Marshal arrived at Herrmanstadt on the 7th May, and was most kindly received by the Archduke, who was then residing there. Indeed, throughout the whole tour"], [79, "17 TRANSYLVANIA. nothing could surpass the consideration and respect with which this distinguished officer was treated. On the 9th he proceeded to Carlsburg, which is situated in the valley of the Maros. This fortress was budt by Charles the Sixth, and is now in exceUent repair. Although of smaU extent, its position and construction are such as to render it capable of consi derable resistance ; for it can only be attacked on its eastern side, and its bastions are spacious and covered with numerous outworks. Its form is that of a regular hexagon. Carlsburg has many pubUc establishments of importance, and amongst others there is a mint, which is weU managed. This part of the country abounds in mines of the precious metals, which have been worked with but Uttle intermission from the time of the Romans, and are now carried on with great spirit and success. On the Ilth, the Marshal resumed his journey, stiU keeping in the vaUey of the Maros, the beauty of which he describes in glowing colours. Near Enget he saw the field of battle on which the Turks were beaten by John Hunyades, at the beginning of the fifteenth cen tury. The position which the Hungarians took up was in an amphitheatre of moderate elevation, and in other respects was very simUar to that which they occupied at the battle of Szasvaros. The Turks attempted to ascend the valley, but being repulsed in front and turned on their left flank, they were completely routed. The Marshal afterwards passed in sight of the salt mines of Marorouwar, which are not only superior to any other in Transylvania, but probably surpass those of the whole of Europe, in the extreme whiteness and exceUent quahty of the salt they produce. He pro-"], [80, "18 TRANSYLVANIA. ceeded to Thorda on the river Aranyos, in which neigh bourhood also there are valuable salt mines. There is reason to beheve that a stratum of salt exists under a great extent of this district. On the foUowing day he entered the vaUey of the Szamos, and proceeded to Clausenburg, the capital of Transylvania. This is a modern city and stands on the site of the ancient one, which many years since feU into decay. The houses of Clausenburg are not lofty ; but the streets, which are spacious, are formed with great regu larity, and converge towards the square in the centre of the place. The town itself has a very duU appearance, but in the suburbs the inhabitants seem active and industrious. The population of the city and suburbs amounts to 20,000. The vaUey of the Szamos is very picturesque, al though it is less beautiful than that of the Maros. The finest breed of Transylvanian horses is found in this part of the country. From Clausenburg, Marshal Marmont went to Dees, and on the 13th he passed the Szamos at Betlhem on his route to Bistriz. Near the latter place there is a magnificent road which crosses the mountains, and leads to Bucovinia. The cost of its construction was very patriotically defrayed by the voluntary contri butions of some of the principal famUies of Transyl vania. On descending the mountain the Marshal entered the smaU province of Bucovinia, which in 1773 was ceded to Austria by Turkey. The object of Austria in obtaining this territory was to estabhsh an easy commu nication between Transylvania and GaUicia, which"], [81, "19 TRANSYLVANIA. latter province had been annexed to the Austrian dominions at the period of the first partition of Poland. In Bucovinia there are very extensive tracts of wood, but the country is in general badly cultivated. On approaching this province from Transylvania, the rich mines of copper and sUver belonging to the Emperor are passed. On the 16th the Marshal reached Czernowitz, on the banks of the Pruth. This small city, which contains only eight thousand inhabitants, is the capital of Buco vinia."], [82, "20 SOUTHEKN EUSSIA. Throughout the whole of Marshal Marmont's tour in the Russian territories, he received the most marked and flattering attention, which seems to have been pecuUarly gratifying to him ; and in modest but feeling language he acknowledges the debt of obligation, that he considers to be due to the Emperor, as weU as to the public authorities he met with in the course of his journey. On crossing the frontier of Southern Russia he found that an officer, who had been sent by Count Woronzow to conduct him to Odessa, had been await ing his arrival for eighteen days. Forty post horses were placed at the Marshal's disposal, and so weU were the arrangements made for expediting his journey, that he considerably outstripped the ordinary speed of Rus sian traveUing, the surprising rapidity of which is weU known. In passing through Bessarabia he found the scenery very monotonous, for although the face of the country is covered with brUUant verdure, it is neither adorned by water nor diversified by extensive woods. The few trees that are met with are however in so flourishing a state, as to leave no doubt that the soU is favourable to the growth of timber ; and it is therefore to be hoped that a judicious system of planting may be adopted,"], [83, "21 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. which would tend both to enrich the country and to give beauty to the scenery. AU the vUlages are buUt in the bottom of the vaUeys, and generaUy in such secluded situations as frequently to escape notice, so that a traveller might pass through this district, and imagine it to be uninhabited. On the 18th the Marshal halted at Kalarasch, and on the foUowing day proceeded towards Odessa. He passed through Kirchenew, the chief place of the province, and crossed the Dniester at Bender, the scene of the foUies of Charles the Twelfth. The fortress on the right bank of the Dniester for merly belonged to Turkey. In the present state of the pohtical relations of Europe there is no great proba bUity of Bender becoming a point of resistance on the frontier, and consequently if this fortress were only considered with reference to its utUity in that respect, there would be no occasion for incurring the expense of maintaining it. But it might nevertheless be ser viceable both as a place of security for stores, and of refuge for isolated troops, in case of internal revolt ; and it is impossible to say what advantage might arise from its possession, in the event of a coUision between Russia and Austria, on the fall of the Ottoman empire. It will therefore be prudent to keep this place in an efficient state, and at the period of the Marshal's visit it was undergoing a thorough repair. On the left bank of tbe river, and nearly three mules from it, there is another fortress which was constructed by the Russians when the Pruth was their frontier ; but as it has, from political changes, ceased to be of importance, it might now be leveUed. Beyond the Dniester commence the extensive sandy plains of this district. Although perfectly barren in"], [84, "22 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. the summer, they are fertihzed by the rains of the winter season. On the 19th Marshal Marmont arrived at Odessa, where he had the gratification of meeting Count Woron zow, the Governor General of Southern Russia. The Marshal expresses that high esteem which he himself feels, and which indeed is universaUy entertained for this distinguished nobleman, who is no less remarkable for his great intelhgence, than for his engaging and highly polished manners ; and it is justly observed that the Count is warmly attached to his country, and makes the most generous and noble use of his princely fortune. Count Woronzow has a general superintendence over the Governors of the provinces; but although they report their proceedings to him, as weU as to the Minister of the Interior at St. Petersburg, it is entirely from the latter that the orders for their guidance emanate. The Marshal also found at Odessa General Count de Witt, who acts in the two-fold capacity of com mander-in-chief of the troops, and inspector of the mditary colonies. It is to the judgment, experience, and surprising activity of this distinguished officer, that these colonies owe their existence and success ; and as they are advan tageous both to the government and to the people, he has, by establishing these admirable institutions con ferred an important benefit on the empire. Southern Russia is composed of the governments of Cherson, Taurida, Ekaterinoslow, and Bessarabia. Odessa, which is both the seat of civil government and the head-quarters of the commander-in-chief of the troops stationed in this part of the empire is"], [85, "SOUTHERN RUSSIA. 23 situated on the shore of a small bay in the Black Sea, between the mouths of the Dniester and the Dnieper. It was founded by the Empress Catherine in 1792, after the peace of Jassy, on a site which was previously a barren waste. The population has increased with rapidity, for in 1804 it amounted to only fifteen thousand; in 1820 it had increased to thirty thousand; and in 1834, to upwards of eighty thousand. Buddings are being erected in every part of the city; but as they are only one story in height, and the streets are unusuaUy wide, the population is spread over a large space, and there is a consequent want of anima tion in the appearance of the place. The theatre, the hospital, the custom-house, and many other public buildings, are very magnificent, and there are also some private mansions which are quite deserving of the title of palaces, on account of their extent and grandeur. The most striking are those belonging to Counts Woronzow and Nariskin. Odessa is seen to the greatest advantage from the sea, and the beauty of the prospect is much heightened by the plantations with which the streets are ornamented, as well as by those of the public garden. In the middle of this garden a statue has been erected to the memory of the Duke of Richelieu, whose name is intimately connected with the founding of this city. Count de Witt has not only the charge of the mUitary colonies, where he rules with all the power of an absolute sovereign, but he is also the commander in-chief of the whole of the troops stationed in this part of the Russian empire. This force is composed of three divisions of reserve of the first army. Formerly the recruiting of the Russian army was verv slow ; an evU which naturally resulted from the"], [86, "24 RUSSIAN ARMY. great extent of the empire in relation to the amount of its population; and the assembly of a large army required long marches, which were performed under circumstances of hardship and privation, occasioning a great loss of men. The Emperor Nicholas, becoming sensible of the necessity of a change, established the present improved system, by which, whUe a facility is afforded for the defence of the frontier, a large force may be coUected with expedition at any central point. With these objects in view, he subdivided the Russian territory into two parts; the one consisting of the provinces which are the most distant from St. Peters burg, and the least peopled ; and the other comprising the central and most densely inhabited portions of the empire. The former subdivsion was relieved from the necessity of furnishing levies for the active army, and was merely required to provide the troops necessary for the defence of the neighbouring frontier; and it devolved on the latter subdivision alone to supply the men requisite for the active army, which, therefore, is now recruited from a population of only forty millions of people. The Russian mUitary force is organized in regiments of seven battalions : six of these are kept in a complete and effective state; four being attached to what is termed the active army, and two to the army of reserve. The seventh battahon is stationed in the district aUotted for the recruiting of the regiment, and gene raUy is not only incomplete, but composed of very young soldiers. At these depots the new levies are partiaUy clothed, and instructed in their first mUitary duties ; they are afterwards forwarded to the battalions of reserve, where their equipments and the remainder"], [87, "25 RUSSIAN ARMY. of their clothing are supphed, and where their instruc tion is completed. The active army consists of 288 battalions, each containing a thousand men. They are formed into divisions and \" corps d'armee,\" in the foUowing manner. The four active battalions of four regiments compose a division of sixteen bat talions ; three divisions form a \" corps d'armee,\" con sisting, of course, of forty-eight battalions ; there are six such \" corps d'armee,\" \u2014 making up the above stated total of 288 battalions. The fifth and sixth battalions of the regiments which compose a \" corps d'armee,\" are formed into a division of reserve. This division consists, therefore, of twenty-four battalions, and three divisions of reserve; that is to say, seventy-two bat tahons form a \" corps d'armee \" of reserve. There are two of these corps, one under the command of Count de Witt, and the other under the orders of the Grand Duke Michael. The former is caUed the Corps of Marshal Sacken, and the latter of Marshal Paskewitz. Each battahon of the reserve contains, in time of peace, 500 men, so that the strength of the army of reserve amounts at present to a fourth of that of the active army, that is, to 72,000 men, making a grand total of 360,000; and this is independent of the corps of guards and of grenadiers, each of which is sufficiently numerous to form in itself a \" corps d'armee.\" From the facUity which the present plan of recruiting the Russian army affords of rapidly increasing its numerical strength, a considerable improvement has been effected in the system that previously existed. So great, however, is the extent of the empire, that in order to have such a disposable force as might be required on any sudden emergency, the Government C"], [88, "26 RUSSIAN ARMY. professes to consider it expedient to keep the army in a complete and effective state. Its present strength is as follows : In the first place there is the Imperial Guard ; this corps is composed of six divisions, three of which are of cavalry and three of infantry. Each of these divisions consists of twelve regiments of cavalry, twelve regiments of infantry, one battalion of sappers, one battahon of marines, one battalion of chasseurs, one battalion of invalids, four batteries of horse artillery, and twelve batteries of foot artiUery. In the Imperial Guard, each regiment of cavalry has seven squadrons, and the regiments of infantry have three battalions each. Secondly, there is the Corps of Grenadiers, \u2014 consist ing of one division of light cavalry of four regiments ; of three divisions of infantry, comprising twelve regiments; of two batteries of horse artiUery ; and of fifteen bat teries of foot artillery. In the grenadiers, the regiments of light cavalry are composed of eight squadrons; and the infantry regi ments have four battahons, of which three belong to the active force, and one to the reserve. Then there are, as has been already stated, six \" corps d'armee,\" each consisting of one division of hght cavalry, of four regiments; three divisions of infantry, each composed of four regiments, and each regiment having four battahons for active service ; two batteries of horse artiUery, and fifteen batteries of foot artillery. The total strength of the six \"corps d'armee\" is therefore twenty-four regiments of hght cavalry, seventy-two regiments of infantry, twelve batteries of horse artiUery, and ninety batteries of foot artUlery."], [89, "27 RUSSIAN ARMY. There are also three corps of cavalry of reserve, consisting of twenty-four regiments, and twelve bat teries of horse artUlery. Besides the force above stated, there are two \" corps d'armee \" of infantry of reserve. Each of these \" corps d'armee\" has three divisions, and each division has twenty-four battalions, so that there are 144 battalions of infantry of reserve. The undermentioned corps are raised for special service. 1st. The Corps ofthe Caucasus, \u2014 consisting of one regiment of dragoons ; three divisions of infantry ; and sixteen batteries of foot artillery. 2nd. The Corps of Orenburg, \u2014 consisting of one division of infantry, of sixteen battahons; and sixteen batteries of foot artiUery. 3rd. The Corps of Siberia, of one division of infantry. 4th. The Corps of Finland, of one division of infantry. There are also for the service of the interior : \u2014 Ten battahons of sappers ; Fifty \u201e for duty in the fortresses ; and One division of horse artUlery of reserve, consisting of nine batteries. Besides these, there are Four battahons of horse artUlery of the Don ; rpwo .. of the Black Sea ; Tw0 \"t} \u201e of Orenburg; and Two \u201e \u00bb of Siberia, The Cossack force is as foUows : \u2014 Fifty-six regiments ofthe Don; Twenty-one \u201e of the Black Sea ; Twelve \u201e of the Caucasus; c 2"], [90, "28 RUSSIAN ARMY. Two regiments of the Danube; One \u201e of Azoff; Three \u201e of Astracan ; Three \u201e of Baschkirs ; Two \u201e of Navropol ; Twelve \u201e of Ural ; Twenty \u201e of Orenburg ; Twelve \u201e of Siberia ; Two \u201e of Little Russia. Total, 146 regiments of 800 men each; that is to say, 116,800 Cossacks. In addition to the force comprised in the foregoing detaUs, there are, at St. Petersburg, as models for the rest of the army, a regiment of cavalry; one of infantry; a battahon of sappers ; and two batteries of foot, with one of horse artiUery. There are also four regiments, each consisting of four battalions, formed of the sons of soldiers, who are educated and instructed in such a manner as to qualify them for being placed as non commissioned officers, in the regiments of the line. Hence it appears that the total strength of the Russian infantry is upwards of five hundred thousand men. A Russian cavalry regiment consists of six effective squadrons of 180 men each; making a total of 1440 men, independently of a squadron which is kept at the regimental depot. Thus if the Marshal's statement be correct as to the number of regiments of cavalry in the Russian army, the effective strength of that branch of the service may be computed to be upwards of ninety thousand men, exclusive of the Cossacks. Judging from the expense incurred in maintaining the armies of the other great powers of Europe, it might naturally be concluded that the finances of the"], [91, "RUSSIAN ARMY. 29 Russian empire would be seriously crippled in having to bear the expense of an army of the magnitude above stated ; but the cost of a soldier in any other European country is so much greater than it is in Russia, that she has no real cause for apprehension on this account. The foUowing statement, which is founded on data afforded by Marshal Marmont, will shew the relative expense to their respective countries of the English, French, Prussian, Austrian, and Russian soldier : \u2014 viz. 120 Enghsh soldiers cost as much as 538 Russian. 120 French \u201e \u201e 340 120 Prussian \u201e \u201e 240 \u201e 120 Austrian \u201e \u201e 212 \u201e WhUe preparations were making by Count Woron zow for the tour of Marshal Marmont in the Krimea, the latter occupied himself in inspecting the Russian Cavalry Colonies, of which a description wiU be here after given. On the 26th of May, he proceeded from Odessa to the river Bug, passing through a country which presented a picture of desolation. At the viUage of Paulowsky he met with an old General of the name of Kores, who had served as chief of the staff of Suwarrow's army. It would ap pear that we are but little acquainted with the real character of this extraordinary man, judging from the interesting conversation of General Kores; for, although Suwarrow pretended to have a contempt for learning and science, few persons were, in reality, more studious than himself. He spoke no less than seven languages; he was a good historian; and in short was a highly educated and enlightened man. Yet, from thoroughly understanding the feelings and"], [92, "30 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. inclinations of those around him, which were the very opposite of his own ; and from knowing the character of the Russian soldier, he thought it prudent to appear anything but what he really was, and to ascribe the successful issue of his various enterprises to inspiration rather than to the result of deep reflection and mUitary skiU. Indeed, he often at Court acted more like a buffoon than a rational being, and the presence even of the Empress Catherine did not always restrain him. There was one man, however, and only one, for whom he had a profound respect, and before whom he never committed any extravagance; \u2014 this was Marshal Romanzoff, who was the first Russian com mander that had succeeded with smaU armies in beating the Turks. Suwarrow's coup d'\u0153il was as extraordinary as his judgment in the presence of the enemy, and the accuracy of his calculations when concerting combined movements with other armies was no less surprising. The following anecdote, which was mentioned by General Kores, affords an instance of this quahty, as well as of the coolness of his former chief. When Suwarrow was at Ryminik, and commanded a corps which did not exceed 18,000 men, he was threatened by the Grand Vizier, who had 80,000 men under his orders. The Prince of Coburg had promised to come to Suwarrow's succour with the Austrian army at a certain time; but as the movements of the Turks were such as to give reason to suppose that they intended an immediate attack, and as the Austrians had not yet arrived, Suwarrow naturaUy became anxious and impatient. But in order to hide these feelings from others, and to impress the officers around him with an idea of his indifference both as to the"], [93, "SOUTHERN RUSSIA. 31 non-arrival of the Austrians, and to the man\u0153uvres of the Turks, he went into a bath, where he remained untU it was announced that the Austrian columns (who were in fact punctual to the appointed time) were seen to be approaching. He then quitted the bath ; mounted his horse ; marched against the enemy, who was in the act of taking up his position ; defeated him ; and put him to flight. Suwarrow on this occasion caused no slight surprise to the Austrian officers, by nimbly climbing to the top of a high tree, for the purpose of getting a better view of the country, and of reconnoitring the enemy. Early in this battle, a body of 6000 Janissaries jumped up behind an equal number of Turkish horse men, and were carried at fuU speed to occupy a com manding eminence, of which the Austrians were also desirous of taking possession. The Janissaries held it for upwards of an hour, but were at last repelled at the point of the bayonet. Suwarrow better understood the feehngs of the soldier than almost any other General, and he never omitted to turn this valuable knowledge to a good account. He possessed moreover an inestimable quahty in a military commander \u2014 the power of en during great privations and fatigue. By being always ready to share the fate of bis soldiers, and even to set them an example of contentment, in cases of suffering, he acquired considerable moral influence over the army. Suwarrow appears ' to have taken a deep interest in the campaigns of Italy, which afforded the earliest evidence of the military genius of Napoleon, and presented the first reason for predicting his future"], [94, "32 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. greatness. Suwarrow was not more astonished at the talent displayed in the plans of so young a general, than at the energy of their execution; and he con sidered the operations of Napoleon's army as worthy of study and imitation. Potemkin, when Commander-in-chief of the Russian army which was opposed to the Turks, principaUy relied on Suwarrow, whose conduct rendered him worthy of the confidence of his chief. Among the many instances of Suwarrow's extraordinary activity the foUowing may be mentioned. On the death of Sultan Abdul Hamet, in 1789, he was suCceded by Selim III. who determined to direct his forces against Walachia. The Prince of Saxe Cobourg, who at that time commanded in this principality, hearing that the Turks were advancing against his camp on the Sereth, sent the information to Suwarrow, who was then at Birlat. Suwarrow immediately set out to join the Prince, and marched with the whole of his army, no less than sixty English mUes, in thirty-six hours, and by joining the Austrians before the Turks could attack them, enabled the Prince to maintain his posi tion. When Marshal Marmont arrived near the banks of the Bug, he found the appearance of the country much more fertile, than at the commencement of his journey from Odessa. He was about to enter the district of the military colonies, and the aUotment of the regiment of Vosningschensky. As this regiment was then in Mol davia, he could only see its estabhshments, which he found in most complete and exceUent order. The houses were neat and clean; the cattle remarkably fine, and every thing in short, bespoke such a state of ease and contentment, that he could neither doubt the"], [95, "SOUTHERN RUSSIA. 33 prosperity of the peasants, nor the care bestowed on the comfort of the troops. On the 27th the Marshal went to Constantinoska, where he saw the reserve squadron of the regiment of Vosningschensky. Being composed entirely of young soldiers, he had only an opportunity of judging of their riding, of which he speaks in favourable terms. He also saw, in the course of that day, three squadrons of the regiment of Odessa, which he describes as being in a most perfect state. On the foUowing day, he inspected the reserve squadron of the regiment of Obschanska, and its agri cultural establishment. Each plough was drawn by three pairs of oxen, and a fourth pair was held in reserve to replace the others when necessary. AU the utensils of husbandry were in good order, and suitable for their purpose ; and the bearing of the men, though respectful, was such as to afford evidence of their feelings of independence, as well as of their state of contentment. They appeared strong and well formed, and their clothes were good, and suitable for the season. The Marshal went to Dobrenka, where he inspected the stud of this regiment. He there saw 180 brood mares, and was informed that when the number should be increased to 250, the remount of the regiment would be rendered a matter of certainty. In fact, it was expected that by the year 1839, the remount of the whole of the cavalry frontier corps would be fur nished by the depots without any expense to the public revenue; and that the horses would be superior to those of any other cavalry in Europe. The Marshal saw at New-Prehongelsky four squad drons of the lancers who bear that name. He found C3"], [96, "34 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. them equaUy efficient with those he had previously inspected. New-Prehongelsky is the frontier station of the military colonies on the side towards Ukrania. On the 29th of May, he reviewed the Hussars of Paulograd, whose man\u0153uvres he describes as having been performed with wonderful precision and rapidity. He dined with the officers of this regiment, and had reason to be much gratified with their hospitable atten tions. The soldiers sang some of their national airs. The Marshal approves of this practice, as tending to raise the spirit of the men on long and fatiguing marches, and especiaUy when the music is so full of melody as that of the Russians; and when the words relate, in simple, though touching poetry, deeds of heroism. On the 3rd of May, he reached Elizabethgrad, which is situated at another extremity of the military colo nies. Count de Witt had ordered a brigade of lancers and a brigade of cuirassiers to assemble there. The former consisted of the regiments of De Witt and of Novograd; and the latter of the regiments of the Grand Duchess Helene, and of Raradonbeff. Each regiment having in the field eight squadrons, the whole force exceeded five thousand men. Besides the cavalry, there was a detachment of horse artUlery, with sixteen guns. Marshal Marmont reviewed these brigades, and passes the highest eulogiums on them. Two things struck him as worthy of being adopted by other nations. The one was, that the troops were not required to be in regular order at the end of a charge ; and the other, that the cuirassiers were armed with lances. He thinks that nothing can be more absurd than to prescribe extreme precision in a move-"], [97, "35 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. ment, which, in his opinion, cannot be conducted with too much impetuosity and energy ; and, therefore, that it is wiser to leave the soldiers at liberty to evince their individual intrepidity, than to place any formal check upon them. Under such circumstances, a certain degree of disorder he admits wiU result; but this he considers of comparatively little importance in the field of battle, especially if the troops are accustomed to charge in the same manner at theh driU, and are instructed in the proper mode of regaining their order. In respect to the more important matter of arming the cuirassiers with lances, he says that he unceasingly, but in vain, attempted to get that system introduced into the French army. It is a point on which he appears to have felt great anxiety, and in his opinion, but little reflection is necessary to produce a conviction that the lance is more properly the weapon of the heavy, than of the hght cavalry. The adoption of the lance for light cavalry probably resulted from seeing it advantageously used by Arabs and Cossacks, without duly considering that what might be a most appropriate weapon for a wandering and pre datory people in a half-civilized state, was not equally adapted for European soldiers who had the means of obtaining arms of a more suitable character. Both the Arabs and Cossacks inhabited countries abounding in fine horses, but where arms of a superior description were either unknown or very scarce. It is therefore easy to conceive that the attention of these warhke people would be directed to the contrivance of some offensive weapon, and that the lance should appear to them to be the most suited to their purpose, as weU as the easiest to be obtained. It may also be reasonably supposed, that their dexterous use of this"], [98, "36 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. weapon would naturaUy lead to its introduction into the armies of Europe, and that the mere circumstance of the idea having been borrowed from a people who only act as light troops, would cause this new arm to be assigned to the light cavalry of the European armies. But Marshal Marmont considers this appropriation of the lance to be very injudicious, and that it is a weapon which should belong exclusively to the heavy dragoons, whose province it is to break the infantry. In order to prove his theory, he supposes a body of cavalry without lances to be ordered to break a square of infantry. Should they, in defiance of the musketry fire of the infantry, succeed in approaching near to the square, they would be unable to effect anything against it. For it is fair to assume that the infantry would remain firm, and if so, their bayonets would keep the cavalry at such a distance, that the swords of the dragoons could not reach the men of the square. The effort would consequently be ineffectual, and the cavalry would be compelled to retreat, after sustaining probably a severe loss. But the Marshal thinks that an equally intrepid corps of cavalry, armed with lances of such a length as to project four feet in front of the horses, could hardly fad to break a square of infantry, however undaunted and firm.* The Marshal is therefore decidedly of opinion, that the heavy cavalry alone, and more especiaUy the cuiras siers, should be armed with lances, and the hght * It may seem presumptuous to differ from so high an authority as Marshal Marmont, but it is generally believed that squares of infantry do not give way in consequence of the prowess of the dragoon, whether armed with the sword or the lance; but that they are broken by the shock of the charge, which forces the horses of the leading squadron through the front ranks of the infantry."], [99, "37 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. cavalry with swords ; because, while he pronounces the lance to be the best weapon for the dragoon, whose duty it is to break through infantry, he regards it as being the very worst for that description of cavalry which is likely to be engaged in single combat, as is the case with light dragoons. For he observes, that if two horsemen be equally expert in the use of their respective weapons, and if one of them be armed with a sword, and the other with a lance, the defeat of the latter would be almost a matter of certainty, because of the facility with which the shorter and more manageable weapon can be made to pany the longer. He adds that it is not the mere arming of the Cossack with a lance, that maks him a formidable cavalry soldier, but that his habits render him so, notwithstanding his being thus imperfectly armed. The Marshal relates the following anecdote in sup port of his theory. At the battle of Dresden, in 1813, the left of the Austrian infantry having been abandoned by the cavalry, the French cuirassiers made several attempts to break through the squares, but were invariably repulsed. At length fifty lancers of the escort of General Latour Maubourg were collected and placed at the head of the cuirassiers. The whole then charged together; the lancers broke the square, and the cuirassiers follow ing them, the Austrian corps was destroyed. The author, after a full consideration of the question, gives it as his decided opinion that the heavy cavalry should be armed with the lance and the straight sword ; and the light cavalry with the carbine, and with the sabre slightly curved. After the review of the lancers and cuirassiers, the Marshal proceeded to Novia-Praga. This place is not"], [100, "38 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. only the head-quarters of the distinguished regiment of that name, but is also the head- quarters of the division of the army of which it forms a part. He observes that the mihtary estabhshments are here, as well as at the other chief stations, in a most complete state of organization. They consist of the stud, the manege, the stables, the houses of the officers and non-com missioned officers, the buildings appropriated to the men, the hospitals, the schools, and the store-houses, the whole of whicli he considers beyond aU praise. In the evening he returned to Ehzabethgrad, which he ranks next in importance to Odessa of aU the cities he saw in Southern Russia. It is a place of commerce, and contains about sixteen thousand inhabitants. On the 1st of June he went to Nicolajeff, where there is an extensive naval arsenal. The town, which was founded by Potemkin, stands on the left bank of the river Bug. The situation of Nicolajeff as a buUding port is weU chosen, for while it is conveniently placed to receive the requisite supphes of wood, iron, hemp, and leather, it is so far removed from the coast as to be safe from any naval attack. On the 2nd of June the Marshal proceeded to the once celebrated town of Ocsakow, the defences of which have been almost reduced to a heap of ruins. On the 6th of December, 1788, this place was taken by assault, and the Turkish garrison, consisting of forty thousand men, were put to the sword. Three months before this event, Suwarrow, who was dissa tisfied with the progress of the siege, had of his own accord escaladed the ramparts with a single regiment, in the expectation that he would have received support, and that the place would have been captured ; but the army remaining idle spectators of this brilliant exploit,"], [101, "THE KRIMEA. 39 and Suwarrow being wounded, he was forced to abandon the position he had gained. As a punishment for this military irregularity, Po temkin deprived him of his exalted post, and sent him to Kinbourn : but, instead of acting as a degradation, it afforded Suwarrow a fresh opportunity of distinguish ing himself. He had under his command a garrison of only nine hundred men, and with this small number he succeeded in beating, and driving into the sea, three thousand Turks, who had landed in the hope of making themselves masters of this important place. What a change, Marshal Marmont observes, has this part of Europe undergone, and what progress has Russia made since that time ! Hordes of Tartars from the Krimea then united with the Turks, and carried war to the banks of the Dnieper; Ukrania was a province of Poland, and the Polish armies acted in conjunction with the Turks and Tartars ; but now Russia is the mistress of Poland; menaces the very heart of Germany; and has her advanced guards at the gates of Vienna and Berhn ; while she pohticaUy holds possession of Constantinople. It is only since the reign of Catherine II. that Russia has been of importance in the balance of power; and it is by efforts of consummate skill, both in diplomacy and arms, that she has raised herself to her present state of eminence. On the 4th of June, Marshal Marmont returned to Odessa, and at length set out for the Krimea. His companions were the Count and Countess Woronzow, Princess Gahtzin, Countess Choiseul, Count de Witt, and Prince Michael Galitzin. This distinguished party embarked on board a magnificent imperial yacht, simi-"], [102, "40 THE KRIMEA. lar to one of those of the sovereigns of England ; and they were attended by a steamer. The Marshal describes this voyage as having been rendered delightful by the fascinating manners of the ladies, and by the desire that aU evinced to make it agreeable. On the 10th they arrived at Sebastopol. Nature has done everything for this magnificent port. The roadstead is deep, and its entrance, which is upwards of fourteen hundred yards in width, is so formed, that while it admits of vessels easUy working through the passage, the anchorage is not exposed to seaward. It is defended by 350 pieces of cannon, and 30 guns \" a, la Pai\u00e6hans.\" There are several small interior harbours formed by various creeks, affording a choice of anchorage accord ing to the winds and the seasons of the year ; and the holding ground is good throughout. Sebastopol greatly resembles the harbour of Malta, although on a much grander scale ; for it is capable of containing an almost unlimited number of ships. The experimental squadron, or as it may more por perly be termed, the squadron of instruction, consisting of five ships of the line and five frigates, had just returned to port when Marshal Marmont reached Sebastopol. He went on board one of the former, which he describes as being a magnificent vessel, and he appears to have been greatly struck by the surpris ing improvement which had evidently taken place in the Russian ships since he had first seen them at Cattaro, about twenty-eight years before the period of his tour. He then considered the Russian fleet as only fit to cope with the Turks; whereas, he now conceives that it might measure itself with any fleet"], [103, "THE KRIMEA. 41 in Europe. With all due deference to the Marshal's judgment in military matters, we must, as Enghshmen, be permitted to doubt his knowledge in nautical affairs, and to withhold our acquiescence from this unsup ported opinion, untU the Russians shall have either proved themselves to be thorough seamen, or gained a victory, when fairly matched, against the fleet of one of the maritime powers of western Europe. The naval force of Sebastopol is under the orders of Admiral Coumani, who, although educated in Russia, is by birth a Greek. It was he who, during the last war with Turkey, performed the signal service of taking possession of Sisopoh, which enabled the Commander in Chief of the Russian forces to form a depot in the Gulf of Bourgas, for ammunition and provisions. At the period of the Marshal's visit, there were under repair, in the port of Sebastopol, six hne-of-bat tle ships; these, with the \"Warsaw,\" which was hourly expected from Nicolajeff, and the experimental squa dron consisting of five hne-of-battle ships, made a total of twelve, as the strength of this fleet, wliich is caUed the Sebastopol fleet. It is held in a state of readiness for active service, and for receiving on board the division of the army cantoned in the Krimea, and amounting to sixteen thousand men. If pohtical events should render it expedient, the embarkation of these troops could be effected in eight and-forty hours; the fleet might get under way on the foUowing day, and owing to the prevalence of the northerly winds in the Black Sea, it would most pro bably reach the mouth, of the Bosphorus in about five-and-forty hours from the time of saUing : so that within five days of the order being issued for the departure of the fleet, and in aU likelihood before the"], [104, "42 THE KRIMEA. Ambassadors of England and France would know that such a movement was in contemplation, the Russian armament would arrive at Constantinople. Marshal Marmont observes that the humiliation of Turkey has rendered it impossible that there should be a conflict in this quarter between any other Euro pean power and Russia, for that on the breaking out of hostihties, or even when circumstances might give reason for supposing that such an event was possible, the Russians would make the DardaneUes a point in their frontier.* The naval force of the Russian empire is divided into two fleets : the larger, consisting of thirty ships of the hne, is stationed in the Baltic; and the smaUer, con sisting of only fifteen, in the Black Sea. The Marshal states that these numbers should be reversed, because he deems it impolitic for the Russians to risk a battle with the English fleet in the Baltic (in which opinion we fully concur), and therefore injudicious of them to retain so many ships in that sea ; but he is of opinion that by making Sebastopol the rendezvous of a powerful * The Marshal has not evinced his usual sagacity in1 the opinions he has hazarded both in regard to the want of inherent strength in Turkey, and to the absence of any aggessive views on the part of the Emperor of Russia, which latter opinion will be found in a subsequent part of this volume. The precautions which it is hoped will be taken by the able generals who are to command the allied armies of England and France will prevent \"the Russians making the Dardanelles a point on their fron tier,\" for they will secure a free communication for the combined fleets between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, by establishing an in trenched camp at Gallipoli, to cut off the northern shore of the Darda nelles from the main continent of Europe, and another and more extensive chain of works stretching from the Black Sea round to the westward of Constantinople, so as to render that city safe against any attack from the Russian army, and to ensure to the allies the command of the Bosphorus."], [105, "THE KRIMEA. 43 fleet, Russia would be enabled to impose laws in the Mediterranean. With this design he would recom mend that the Russian fleet in the Black Sea should consist of thirty sail of the hne, and that, on the breaking out, or on the mere expectation of hostihties, it should be stationed in the DardaneUes, where it would have the support of the batteries and forts which defend that passage, and at the same time be near its resources. He thinks the combined fleet of England and France might thus be kept in check, as, in that position, the Russian fleet would be in readiness to enter the Mediterranean whenever circumstances might give it the numerical superiority. In making these observations, Marshal Marmont of course assumes that no circumstance of provocation, nor any suspicion of the aggressive intentions of Russia would induce the other powers of Europe to break through or disregard the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi; and that, therefore, the Russians are likely to have, untd the expiration of that treaty, the full and undis turbed sovereignty of the Black Sea, with the right of excluding from the DardaneUes the ships of war of every other foreign nation. That under such a state of things, the Russian fleet would occupy these straits we freely admit; but it cannot be conceded that England, deeply interested as she is in this matter, would aUow herself, in a case of extremity, to be bound by the treaty in question. On the contrary, we may feel confident that she would take the justifiable step of forcing the DardaneUes and Bosphorus, and of making herself mistress of the Black Sea, from which she should never afterwards permit her fleets to be excluded. Again, should the Russians be beforehand with the English and their allies in getting possession of the"], [106, "44 THE KRIMEA. Dardanelles, and should occupy this position in such force as to be enabled to defy the efforts which the combined fleets might make to dislodge them, we may be allowed to question their power to venture in safety beyond the protection of the forts. For, if the com bined fleets were equal in strength to the fleet of Russia, and the latter should be tempted from its place of fan cied security by the temporary absence of the ships of the aUies, the Russian Commander would probably find to his cost that the prevaUing northerly winds would prevent his re-entering the DardaneUes, and expose him to the necessity of fighting a battle. We may therefore conclude, that nothing but indifference on the part of England could lead to the results predicted by the Marshal. On a height not far from Sebastopol are the ruins of the ancient city of Cherson. A short distance from hence there is a monastery, on the site of which a temple of Diana once stood. Count Woronzow accompanied the Marshal in the tour of the Krimea, and made such arrangements as admitted of his guest inspecting every thing that was considered worthy of notice. They first examined the works for supplying Sebas topol with water, which have been formed with much skiU by an English engineer. Thence they proceeded to Karoles, to visit Adhil-Bey, a Tartar Prince, and they after afterwards continued theh route to Baki- Serai, passing through a country which, owing to its scanty population, is almost uncultivated. Baki-Serai at a remote period was the capital of Taurida, and the palace which was then occupied by the Khan is still kept in repair. This budding contains numerous beautiful apartments."], [107, "THE KRIMEA. 45 Baki -Serai once had a considerable population, but it does not now contain above 8,000 inhabitants, aU of whom are of the Tartar race. It is a popular error to suppose that the Tartars of the Krimea are descendants of the tribe of Genghis Khan, for that tribe was of the Mogul race and of Chinese origin. The Tartars of the Krimea, on the contrary, are a very handsome people, and resemble the Osmanlies not only in feature, but also in their gravity and dignity of manner. Simpheropol, the present capital of Taurida, stands in the centre of the steppes, and is the place of resi dence of the Governor of this district. On the 13th of June, Marshal Marmont and Count Woronzow proceeded to Tschonfort-Kale, a viUage about a league distant from Baki- Serai. It is occupied by a sect of Jews, who are supposed to have adopted, before the birth of our Saviour, a different creed from the rest of their nation. Considerable numbers of this sect are to be met with at Kosloff, Jerusalem, and Con stantinople. At the time of the Marshal's tour, an attempt was making at Simpheropol to obtain water by boring, and there was reason to expect that the operation would be successful not only here, but throughout the steppes, and confer an immense advantage on this country, in which the deficiency of water is a great check to agri culture. This system of obtaining water has long been known in Siberia, where borings have been carried to the depth of even a thousand feet. The soil of the Krimea is peculiarly suited to the vine and the olive tree ; and from the attention bestowed on the cultivation of the former, it is expected that the"], [108, "46 THE KRIMEA. wine of this district will become celebrated for its ex cellence. On the 24th the Marshal and his companions reached Sudac, where the Genoese, in the days of their power, had a colony, and one of their forts has remained to the present time. This part of the coast has a very desolate and sterile appearance. On the 25th they arrived at Theodosia, one of the most ancient cities of the Krimea. The Ionians, who were its founders, called it Caffa, but on the city being captured by Leucon, the King of Bosphorus, he changed its name to that of his wife, by which it has ever since been known. By making Theodosia a free port, Leucon consi derably increased its trade, and at a later period, the Genoese having purchased a large tract of country from the Khan, and established themselves in this city, it became the seat of an extensive commerce with India, by Astrakan and the Caspian Sea. The next place visited by Marshal Marmont was Kershe, which stands on the site of the ancient Panti cap\u00e6um : in this city Mithridates closed his Use. Upon the spacious plains around Kershe, there are numerous tumuli, which are supposed to have been the places of interment of the Princes and distinguished people of this nation. There are also several cemeteries which were probably appropriated to the lower classes. The great extent of these cemeteries, and the number of the tumuli afford conclusive evidence that the population of this country must have been considerable. Kershe is rapidly rising into prosperity, in some degree as a consequence of its position, and partly from the regula tions established by Count Woronzow to promote the commerce of the country. Formerly the corn which"], [109, "47 THE KRIMEA. grew on the banks of the Don and to the northward of the Sea of Azoff was exported from Taganrog, but this was found to be inconvenient to trade, owing to the delays resulting from a bad administration of the sana tory laws, and to the difficulty of navigating the Sea of Azoff with large vessels. To avoid these evds, Count Woronzow has made Kershe the entrepot for the commerce of the Sea of Azoff, and has concentrated here the whole of the qua rantine establishment of the Krimea. The ships des tined for aU parts of the Turkish dominions are there fore obliged to come to Kershe, to undergo a quarantine. By this arrangement greater vigilance is insured in detecting cases of danger of infection from plague, and a stop has been put to those vexatious delays which occurred when each port, as a necessary consequence of the old system, had its own quarantine estabhshment. The trade of the Sea of Azoff is now carried on by vessels of small tonnage, which discharge their cargoes at Kershe. On the 28th the party made an excursion to the island of Taman, which is inhabited by Cossacks, who are descendants of a colony of Cossacks of the Dnieper and the Bug. They were placed here by Catherine the Second, to defend the frontier of the Cauban against the Circassians. Marshal Marmont expresses great surprise that Russia, witb the enormous mass of trooops at her disposal, and with ample means of transporting men and ammunition to the scene of action, should have been unable to subdue the Circassians, who have long been left to their own resources. The island of Taman is remarkable for its fertility, and abounds in fine horses. The Marshal was much"], [110, "48 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. pleased with the feats of horsemanship performed by some of the Cossacks of this district, who are extremely agile. The predatory warfare in which they are con stantly engaged with the Circassians renders them sagacious, vigUant, and bold. It is, in short, the continual exercise of their facul ties, required by the circumstances in which they are placed, that so peculiarly qualifies the Cossacks of the frontier for the duties of hght troops. Whenever another war may break out, they wiU be found to be far superior, as soldiers, to the Cossacks of the Don, who, from being no longer on the frontier, are free from those anxieties and dangers which make borderers both wary and enterprising. On the 28th, Marshal Marmont and the party who accompanied him, embarked on board the steamer, and in thirty-six hours they reached the town of Bregenski, on the northern coast of the sea of Azoff. This place has been selected by Count Woronzow for a commer cial port, in consequence of its being the nearest to that part of the country which produces the largest quantity of grain. The anchorage is sheltered by banks, and by a point of land jutting into the sea. The town at present contains only two thousand inha bitants; but as it is likely, from the advantages it offers for commercial transactions, to monopobze the trade of Taganrog, a rapid increase of thfr population may be expected. After the conquest of the Krimea, Catherine estab lished, near the shore of the sea of Azoff, a colony, consisting of about thirty-four thousand Nogais Tartars, inhabitants of the steppes in the environs of Astrakan. The object of the Empress was to people the desert she had just acquired."], [111, "49 SOUTHERN RUSSIA. These Tartars retained their manners and customs, and continued to follow their pastoral style of hfe, untU about thirty years ago, when Le Comte de Maison, a French emigrant, proposed to the Emperor Alexander to draw them to agricultural pursuits. His offer being accepted, he settled amongst them, and devoted him self to the task he had undertaken, in which he par tially succeeded. The Nogais Tartars are a mild and docile people, but it is singular, that notwith standing they are faithful to any trust confided to them, they are much addicted to thieving. Theh features distinctly indicate their Chinese origin, and aU the individuals of the tribe bear a strong re semblance to each other. A remarkable contrast exists between these Tartars and their neighbours, the Mennonists, a religious sect, of which the greater part hve on the banks of the Vistula. They are of Germanic origin, and have the habits and manners of Quakers ; like them, too, the Men nonists have a horror of shedding human blood. Indeed they carry this feeding so far, as even to consider self-defence a crime. Between thirty and forty years since, the Emperor of Russia aUotted some land in the steppes to this people, which they undertook to fertilize ; and he gave them wood for budding their houses, besides affording them every other facUi'cy for colonization. They have prospered in an extraordinary degree, and one indivi dual in particular, of the name of Cornis, whose fathei commenced hfe as poor as the rest of these settlers, has aheady reahzed a large fortune by his industry and inteUi^ence. He is the owner of no less than 7000 sheep 80 cows, and 125 brood mares, besides a large landed property. D"], [112, "50 THE KRIMEA. The greatest good order prevails in this colony, which consists of seventeen hundred famUies. Though the Mennonists have no ministers of religion, they frequently assemble for prayer, and are a very pious people. Their good example has had great influence on the neighbouring Tartars. On quitting the Mennonists, the Marshal proceeded to the district of the Duchoborgs, who form another remarkable contrast to the Mennonists. The religious faith of the Duchoborgs is founded on tradition, and not on Scripture. They have no settled form of worship, nor ministers of rehgion, although they beheve in a future state of rewards and punish ments. They meet at certain fixed periods for prayer, but theh religious rites are stated to be of a very licentious kind. On the 2nd of July, the Marshal proceeded to Pere cope for the purpose of returning to the Krimea. An old hne of intrenchment, consisting of a deep ditch and an earthen rampart, extends across the Isthmus; and about midway between the two seas there is a fortress, of Turkish construction, which is kept in tolerable repair. Near Perecope there are natural salt pans of im mense extent. On the 3rd, the party proceeded towards Kosloff, and on theh way examined the mud baths at Sark, which are represented as being very efficacious. Kosloff stands on the site of the ancient Eupatoria ; its inhabitants, who are chiefly Jews and Tartars, and about twelve thousand in number, are engaged in commerce. On the 4th, the Marshal inspected an estate of Count Woronzow. The district of which it forms a"], [113, "51 CAVALRY COLONIES. part, as well as the neighbourhood of Kershe, are celebrated for their lamb-skins, which are improperly caUed the lamb-skins of Astrakan. The wool is curly, and of a dark greyish colour, approaching to black : its superior quahty is attributable both to the exceUence of the pasturage, and to the breed of sheep, which is pecuhar to this part of the country. The value of the skin is much increased by the lamb being kiUed immediately after its birth, and the finest, and of course the highest priced skins, are those which are taken from lambs whose mothers are killed when on the point of parturition. Marshal Marmont here took leave of Count Woronzow, and sailed for Constantinople ; but before closing our notice of this part of his work, it wiU be proper to say a few words respecting the Russian cavalry colonies. Although the idea of forming mUitary colonies in Southern Russia was borrowed from the Austrian colonies, the principle upon which the latter were founded has been much departed from. In Austria, as has been shewn in a former part of this work, the colonists perform not only the military service of the district in which they reside, but cultivate the land aUotted to them ; whereas the soldiers of the Russian cavalry colonies are not in any way engaged in the pursuits of agriculture, and are entirely distinct from the peasantry. There were, in this part of the Russian Empire, vast tracts of land belonging to the crown, and occupied by a considerable agricultural population. A district having been selected in 1821, by General Count de Witt for the commencement of this colonial system, the third division of cuirassiers, consisting of four D 2"], [114, "52 CAVALRY COLONIES. regiments, and mustering in aU about 5000 men, marched into it, and perfect success having attended the first experiment, the Emperor directed that the system should be extended, and that five divisions of cavalry should be colonized. The people on whom they were quartered were Cossacks of the Bug, Walachians, Moldavians, and some Bulgarians who had quitted Turkey. Each regiment, consisting of about 1200 men, was quartered upon a resident population of about 12,000 souls, and the land assigned to them was subdivided into two portions ; one for the use of the inhabitants, and the other for the profit of the crown. Each peasant received the materials requisite for the construction of his house, and a grant was made to him of the land that could be tided by one plough. As a return for these benefits he undertook to work for two days in each week on the land reserved by the crown ; to lodge and feed one soldier ; and to keep four pairs of oxen, two draught horses, two cows, and twelve sheep; besides which the whole body of the peasantry engaged to furnish the recruits neces sary for keeping up the strength of the colonized regiments. It being determined that the several squadrons, each of which consists of 180 men, should be kept distinct, and that one soldier should be lodged in every house, the vUlages were limited to 180 houses, and the whole were required to be budt on one uniform plan. In addition to the regimental officers of the colo nized cavalry, there is a body of officers who are responsible for all matters of civil administration, and for conducting the judicial proceedings of the inhabi-"], [115, "CAVALRY COLONIES. 53 tants. For this latter purpose a tribunal is formed, consisting of a chief of a squadron, a lieutenant, a ser jeant major, the priest of the village, and three heads of famUies selected from amongst the peasantry. The officers employed in the civil administration, as weU as those belonging to the regiments, are under the orders of the generals of the divisions. Criminal matters come under the cognizance of a Court Martial. The regimental conscription does not remove the men from theh homes, and each succeeding year it wUl fall lighter on the peasantry, in consequence of the rapid increase of the population. Owing to inter marriages a large proportion of the soldiers are already the connexions of those upon whom they are quartered; and in the next generation the whole of the mUitary wiU be the kinsmen of the civUians. Great care has been bestowed in establishing schools for educating the troops and the chUdren of the peasantry, who, whUe under instruction, are subject to military discipline. The whole of the male population is at a very early age instructed in horsemanship, and military exercises. This adds materially to the value of the colonial regiments, for thus there are always effective and weU trained young men ready to fill up vacancies in the ranks. Each soldier has to serve fifteen years in the active force, and five in the reserve, besides which he has to remain five years more disposable for the army, in the event of war. When the Emperor inspected one of these colonies, a regiment, consisting of 600 boys, exercised under his personal direction ; the whole, with their colonel, who was only eleven years of age, performing with precision and celerity aU the"], [116, "54 CAVALRY COLONIES. man\u0153uvres that would have been required of experi enced soldiers. Each regiment has a stud for breeding its horses, which are of a superior description, being large, strong, and active; and they are rendered very hardy by being allowed to run wUd on the steppes untU required for service. The Emperor furnishes the pay of the soldiers, the cloth for theh uniforms, and their arms and equip ments, but everything else is supphed by the colonies. From hence it results that the expence of maintaining one of the colonial cavalry regiments is only five twelfths of that of any other cavalry regiment in the Russian service. Three divisions of colonized regiments are in the Government of Cherson, and two in that of Charkoff, and theh whole strength amounts to no less than twenty-eight thousand men. We will now proceed with Marshal Marmont's journal, in nearly his own words freely translated."], [117, "55 CONSTANTINOPLE. We made the voyage from Kusloff to Constantinople in fifty-two hours, reaching the coast before daylight, and as I was desirous of inspecting the channel of the Bosphorus, and of contemplating its beauties, I directed the Captain not to enter the Straits till sunrise. The width of the channel at the northern extremity does not exceed 1200 yards, it rapidly diminishes to 900, and narrows until it is reduced to 660 yards across. Numerous batteries which have been erected on both its shores, in weU-chosen positions, render its defence easy and effective.* This passage cannot be forced; and the return to the Black Sea, of any fleet that might have unsuccessfully attempted it would be very difficult, because the prevading winds and currents, which favour the entrance, present very serious obstacles to an exit from the Straits. At day-break we entered the Bosphorus. The beauty of the scenery Jwhich meets the eye has often been described in glowing colours, but it is impossible to convey a just idea of its grandeur, or of the impres sion it makes on those who see it for the first time. The reason is, that in man the power of feeling is * These defences are not so perfect as the Author seems to consider them.

From the entrance of the Bosphorus down to Con stantinople frequent changes take place in the features of the country, and a thousand beautiful points of view successively present themselves. An immense popu lation is spread upon its shores, and innumerable houses are seen, which though slightly budt and of a style of architecture generally picturesque and sometimes fan tastical, appear invariably constructed with elegance and taste. The number of boats in motion is such as to excite our wonder; we observe a state of vegetation that shows what nature is capable of producing if man would but wisely direct her efforts, and we behold a sun whose rays possess a lustre rarely equaUed. Close to the mouth of the Bosphorus, is the vUlage of Buyuk-dere, which is situated on the northern side of a small bay, and opposite Therapia.* These two vUlages studded with country houses, form the summer residence of the diplomatic body. Further on, the population along the shore becomes more dense, and the banks of the channel improve in beauty. Formerly the defence of the Bosphorus was concen trated at its narrowest part. It then consisted of merely two castles, one on the European and the other on the Asiatic shore, nearly opposite to each other ; but they are no longer the sole means of safety, for if resistance were to be confined to that position, the excellent anchorage of Buyuk-dere would be abandoned to the enemy, which would be a fatal error. f The * Both on the European coast.

On both shores and beyond the castles, a succession of houses gives a liveliness and beauty to the country ; those upon the European side have scarcely any interval between them, and amongst the number are some of the palaces belonging to the Sultan and his family. The Palace of BeUonbey-Stavros, which has for some years past been occupied by the Grand Signor, is on this shore.* Further on we came abreast of Top-hana and Galata, and opposite the city of Constantinople. Our attention was afterwards directed to the entrance of the harbour, known at the period of the Greek empire, as the celebrated Golden Horn ; then to the opening of the sea of Marmora, which may be deemed exclusively the property of Turkey, for it is enclosed within her straits and shores ; the Asiatic coast enriched by tombs, and venerated as it is by Mussulmans, de manded next our observation ; the viUage of Chalcedon was also worthy of remark, for in that position stood formerly the ancient City of the Blind ; then came Mount Olympus, towering to the clouds, as if it would aspire to be the throne of the Eternal Being. In short, whichever way we turned, our hearts were touched by the contemplation of beautiful objects, or the recol lection of the names and deeds of the Ulustrious dead. The steamer having anchored off Top-hana, I landed * The author is incorrect in giving this appellation to the Palace. \"Beyler-Bey,\" is the Turkish name of a mosque on the Asiatic side; \" Stavros,\" the Greek name of a village inhabited chiefly by Greeks, near that mosque.

For we find the population in a state of abject wretchedness; the houses smaU and buUt of wood ; the streets pestiferous, rugged and narrow ; the numerous coffee-houses fiUed with idlers ; aU the inter vals between the various quarters occupied by tombs ; and animals, disgusting in appearance, and without an owner, seemingly in undisturbed possession of the place. On entering the house which you are to inhabit, you have to contend with other painful and distressing feehngs, for you are told that if, during the night, a fire should break out in the quarter in which you are lodged, refuge may be taken in a convent, or in some few neighbouring houses, which are built of stone. Indeed, conflagrations are so frequent in this city, that the eyes of its inhabitants are rarely closed with any feehng of security ; and those amongst the rich who keep their treasure in theh houses, a not unusual practice, are constantly exposed to the risk of losing both theh lives and their wealth. AU is at Constantinople so precarious and uncertain, and there are so many chances of life being suddenly cut off, that the inhabitants should regard themselves as travellers whose lives and property are menaced by a thousand Uls. * Top-hana is the Turkish for cannon-foundry. (T.)"], [121, "59 CONSTANTINOPLE. On the 14th of July, I took possession of my resi dence, and then entered on my circuit of inspection, commencing with the harbour. It is probably the finest in the world, for it is not only good and safe, but it is capable of containing an almost infinite number of ships. Its forests of masts and its great length, give it the appearance of the Thames, near London ; and we were also reminded of the entrance to the great canal of Venice, by the number and pecuhar form of the boats, which are seen ghding swiftly through the water in all directions. Everything at this point has so much the character of grandeur and prosperity, that it is difficult to fancy it the capital of a falling and expiring emphe, having barely a municipal existence. The declining state of this power may be weU compared to the human body, in which death begins at the extremities, the last struggles for hfe being at the heart.* I landed in the suburbs, where I saw the mosque of Eyoub. It is there that the Grand Signor, on mount in^ the throne, girds himself with the sword of Oth man; a vain ceremony, which bringing to our minds the energy and power of theh ancestors, serves but to shew more forcibly the weakness of the present race of monarchs.

The grand Signor has a palace there, which he occasionally visits, but never inhabits. A canal, ornamented with marble, skirts this beautiful walk, which, on certain days is enlivened by a crowd of per sons. The greater proportion of the vehicles they use, are covered carts, drawn by oxen, and tastefully deco rated. The remainder, hung on springs and drawn by horses, resemble more the form of European carriages. But oxen are more suited to the hiUy, rugged streets of this metropoUs. The carriages are filled with women, wearing veils, and sometimes accompanied by children. On arriving at the Mall they quit the vehicles and seat themselves beneath some shady tree, where they partake of a slight repast of herbs. The veil leaves the eyes and frequently the nose exposed, and seldom hides more than the mouth. Dancers of both sexes, with jugglers and musicians, enliven the scene, and afford to these women, who rarely quit the Harem, great pleasure and enjoyment. SimUar fetes are held at the Fresh Waters of Asia. On the 15th of July, I ascended the tower of Galata, from whence the best view is obtained of the vast extent of Constantinople. The eye commands the whole peninsula on which the city stands, with Scutari, the harbour and the Bosphorus, the Princes' Islands and the suburbs of Top-hana, Pera, and Galata. No other spot on earth presents so beautiful a view, and we are led to consider what it must have been in former days, when handsome buildings and splendid palaces arose in all directions ; whereas now there is not a vestige left of aU this grandeur. Not merely have the palaces been broken down by time and by the hands of man, but even theh ruins have been buried or dispersed ; and the little that remains of all the ancient power and splen-"], [123, "CONSTANTINOPLE. 61 dour is hidden from the light of day. Theh me morials must be sought for underground. An im mense assemblage of miserable dwellings little better than huts, which a single spark might cause to be con sumed, is aU that now appears. These painted houses can only be regarded as a temporary shelter ; truly is it therefore said, \" the Turks have merely pitched theh tents in Europe.\" In descending from the tower of Galata, I proceeded to Buyuk-dere, to the house of Baron Sturmer, the Austrian Internuncio, who, in the most friendly manner, had invited me to become his guest. I found in the Baroness an amiable and clever countrywoman. Thence I went to Therapia, where I saw Admiral Rous sin, the French Ambassador, and I was much affected by the warm reception which he and his lady gave me. I made such arrangements, as on leaving Buyuk-dere, would admit of my inspecting everything worthy of notice on this side of Constantinople, where the works have been constructed for supplying this capital with water. On the morning of the 16th, I set out from Buyuk dere, accompanied by two very distinguished young men, Baron Testa, an attache to the Austrian em bassy, and Captain Folze, aide-de-camp to Admhal Roussin. On entering the vaUey of Therapia we halted at the plantain of Godfrey of Bouillon, under the shade of which it is said that this great man reposed before he crossed over to Asia. It is evidently a tree of great age, and its form is singular, being composed of the union of seven stems springing from the same root. The trunks of some of them are in actual contact. They are about seven or eight feet in diameter, and"], [124, "62 TURKEY. together they enclose a space of between thirty- five and forty feet across. We ascended the valley of Buyuk-dere, and shortly entered the woods, which are the beginning of what is very improperly caUed the forest of Belgrade. At its outskirts, the trees were of an inferior growth, but on advancing farther we found them very fine, and chiefly of chesnut and oak. We went to the aqueduct of Baktchi-kieui, and then to the reservoir of Valide.* The latter takes its name from that of the mother of the Sultan who caused its construction; it is magni ficent, and lined with white marble. The dyke that retains the water is very lofty : it crossed the lower part of the valley, in which a col lection is formed of rain water and the water that proceeds from a small rivulet. From thence we went to the wretched vUlage of Belgrade, which gives its title to the misnamed forest. We there rested under a tree to partake of a delicious breakfast, for which we were indebted to the kindness of Baron Sturmer. We observed a few clean and well built houses, presenting a contrast to the greater number of the habitations. The land surrounding the viUage is but partiaUy and very indifferently cultivated. It is easy to conjecture what must be the state of things in the provinces, when they are found in this condition at the very gates of the metropohs ; yet it is astonishing that the symp toms of bad government should so soon present them selves. Near Belgrade is a second and smaUer reservoir, and a circular basin in which the water is collected. From thence it diverges either by aqueducts or subterraneous * The reservoirs are called \" Bendts,\" and that alluded to should be distinguished hy the name of \" Valide Bendt.\" (T.)"], [125, "63 CONSTANTINOPLE. channels, to Pera and Constantinople. Beyond is the viUage of Pyrgos, and near it is situated the long aque duct, which is extensive but possesses no beauty. I afterwards inspected what is called the aqueduct of Justinian, but its erection should be ascribed to Con stantine. There Roman grandeur appears; the ma sonry is similar to that of the ancient Roman amphi theatres, and the height of the work is at least eighty feet. Three other aqueducts of inferior dimensions, stretch ing across smaU valleys, complete this portion of the arrangement for the supply of water, which is worthy of admiration. In retracing our steps we visited ano ther beautiful reservoir, the embankments of which are reveted with white marble. It was constructed by the reigning Sultan Mahmoud.* There are also other works for the same purpose. The general system is to take advantage of the numerous vaUeys of this very uneven country, aU of which slope towards Constan tinople, or the Bosphorus, and to coUect in them the waters of the various streams, as weU as the accu mulation from rain, in order to conduct the whole to its destination. The execution of the requisite works and the arrangements for the distribution of the water have devolved, in an hereditary manner, on Turkish managers, who have acquitted themselves creditably in their most important office. This assemblage of spa cious and magnificent reservoirs, having their embank ments supported by marble waUs, and of numerous aqueducts, which are visible in aU directions, present a most imposing appearance. These works are generaUy in good repair, which * This reservoir is called \" Mahmoud Bendt,\" and is situated near the village of Baktchi-kieui.

On the 17th of July I commenced my regular in spection of the capital. I crossed the Harbour to see the Baktchi-kapoussi, or Gate of the Gardens, a very inferior Greek structure. We then went to the Egyp tian Bazaar, an extremely old building detached from the great Bazaar. It is here that spices, medicines, balsams, resins, and aU the articles of Eastern mer chandize are sold. This, hke aU the Bazaars in Con stantinople, is very beautiful and extensive. So spa cious are these markets that if collected together they would equal in size an extensive city, having all its streets covered. Men, horses, and carriages easily cir culate throughout them. They are a creation of the East, for nothing simUar is elsewhere to be seen. They are cities appropriated only to commercial matters, where the various sorts of merchandize are classed according to theh several kinds. In the great Bazaar, which is of immense size, there may be procured nearly every article that can be required, and particularly such as have not a special establishment. On leaving the Egyptian Bazaar, we directed our steps towards tbe \" Sublime Porte.\" In our way we saw the mausoleum of the Sultan Abdulhamid, father of the reigning monarch. It consists of a small rotunda, surrounded by cypress-trees, and hghted by several * The population is computed at six hundred thousand souls.

There is a sameness in aU the places of sepulture of the Sultans and their mothers, which are situated in tliis quarter. Some of them contain the remains of several persons; they have a fountain at theh entrance, and water is so scarce and costly in this dry and naked country, that it is an act of great charity and muni- ficence to provide it for the poor in all directions, as is here the case. What is called the \" Sublime Porte,\" is a spacious buUding opposite to the principal entrance to the Seraglio. The Grand Vizier resides there, and aU the other Ministers have their offices within this edifice. The etymology of this name is doubtless taken from the time when aU the affairs of state were con- ducted in the open air, \u2014 at the gate of the Palace, \u2014 or of the house ; as with us, the word \" Court,\" in its diplomatic sense, is derived from the use that was for merly made of the uncovered space enclosed within the walls of mansions. At Constantinople, the \" Sublime Porte \" is, properly speaking, the Palace of the Govern ment. It is very remarkable, that the most absolute of empires should have been the earliest in adopting the distinction which now prevails in representative govern ments, between the Sovereign who reigns and the Ministers who rule. This distinction has ever been held sacred in Turkey. The Sovereign is there only to occupy the summit of the edifice, while he establishes the base of the structure by selecting his Ministers, and when they are condemned by public opinion, or things are badly managed by them, they are punished by his will, but he is not supposed to take a part in the direction of affairs. This principle is carried to such an extent, that when the Grand Vizier takes the com-"], [128, "66 TURKEY, mand of the army, and the government is carried on by his Lieutenant, who is called the \" Kaimacan,\" this officer is not responsible to the Sultan, but to the Vizier. Sultans have sometimes faUen victims to popular fury, but these events have been exceptions to the general rule, and are at variance with the usual working of the state machine. They have been the results of revolutions, and we know that when they happen, nice distinctions are not observed. After having looked through the Palace of the Porte, we entered the Seraglio, or palace of the Sultan; it occupies a triangular space at the extremity of the peninsula on which Constantinople stands. The waUs constructed on the two sides towards the sea, join those of the city, which the third side separates from the Seraglio. The principal entrance is in the middle, opposite to the Sublime Porte, and near to the mosque of Saint Sophia.* We passed the gate and entered a spacious enclosure, which includes the Mint and a very large court. It is under the very eyes of the Sultan, that during the last fifty years the standard of gold and sUver has dady un dergone a change; that the administration in ruining the country, ruins itself, and by an ignorant cupidity, gives an uncertainty to cash transactions, which so far from producing the desired end, effects an opposite result. Fifty years ago, the Turkish piaster was worth fifty French sous : at a stdl more distant period its value was the same as that of Spain ; now, it may be reckoned as being equal to only five sous ; and it wiU not remain * The Imperial gate, which is considered the principal entrance, is not exactly opposite the Porte, but fronting one of the handsomest fountains in Constantinople, situated in an open space adjoining the Mosque of St. Sophia.

The annual coinage would, at first sight, appear to produce a fraudulent benefit of some miUions, since the government pays in gold and silver inferior in value to that which should be issued to liquidate its debt. But, on the other hand, it is wronged in what it receives, for as the rates of duties and taxes do not change, and as the amount annuaUy paid into the treasury is in a depreciated coin, the Government gets a sum intrinsicaUy smaUer than its due, and thus its avarice is punished. This state of things has produced a stdl more deplo rable result, in the ruin of those who had debts of long standing due to them; and daUy makes new victims, creating confusion and uncertainty in aU commercial transactions. The only means of avoiding its effects, and this the European merchants have adopted, is to make bargains in a foreign coin of fixed value, so that payments can be made in piasters at their current price. The Turks not having equal inteUigence, have sacrificed the fortunes they embarked in commerce. The machinery of the mint is tolerably regulated, although of an old construction ; and notwithstanding the dies are worked by hand, the coins are weU struck. Those of gold are of twenty, of ten, and of five piasters; those of sUver are of five, of three, of two piasters, and of one, and of half a piaster ; and those of copper washed with silver, of one para, that is, of the fortieth part of a piaster, which is equivalent to the ||* part of a French centime. The para is so hght, that the wind wiU blow it from the hand.* We could not succeed in gaining an entrance to the second court of the Seraglio, as we were prevented by a * A table, showing the value in English money, of the Turkish coins will be found in the Appendix.

It is there that the ambassadors of the Christian Powers are first admitted to theh solemn audience, and that the Grand Vizier receives them. It is known what extravagant pride the Turks feel in this ceremony. The practice was as foUows, a few years since : \u2014 The ambas sador being introduced to the second court, was there deshed to remain. The Sultan was apprized of his arrival in words like these : \" A poor Christian, naked and perishing with hunger, demands to be admitted to an audience of your Highness.\" The Sultan answered : \" Clothe and feed him ; \" thereupon a pelisse was given to the \" poor Christian,\" and he was taken to the ban quetting haU. From the point where we are standing we saw the third gate, which opens directly into the apartments of the Grand Signor. In this third enclosure are two beautiful cupolas ; one is appropriated to the sacred standard, and the other to covering the throne room. Not being able to penetrate farther, we returned, and presented ourselves at a gate which opens from the first court into the gardens, and leads towards the point of the Seraglio. We were stopped by a sentinel, but I entered into conversation with him, through my inter preter. Finding he was a poor recruit, I asked him if he knew his exercise; and, on his answering in the affirmative, I put him through the motions. He en tered into this with great good-humour, and we became such friends that he permitted us to pass. The first gardens that we crossed are composed of flower-beds, formed with but little taste. On the Square of SheUs"], [131, "CONSTANTINOPLE. 69 there are fine cypress trees, and these comprise the only beauty of the place. We then advanced to another enclosure, which is called the Square of the Column. The column, which is stiU standing, is ancient and of beautiful proportions ; on its base it has the following inscription \u2014 \" Fortun\u00e6 reduci ob devictos Gothos,\" and it is an object of peculiar superstition to the Turks. From thence a ramp leads into a garden, or rather grass plot, adorned with beautiful flowers. I was told that it belonged to the treasurer. Our walk gave us a general idea of this Seragho, so undeservedly celebrated and extolled, its only beauty being in its position. The interior of the building, of which we had made the circuit, was not open to us, but it did not much excite our curiosity. We quitted the palace by a different gate from that by which we had entered it, and then proceeded to the Hippodrome. There is not any ruin to recaU the former appro priation of this place. The only antiquities that we observed were an Egyptian obelisk of red granite, known at the time of Theodosius, and the lower part of one of brass, of smaU proportions.* They produced no impres sion on the mind ; but it was otherwise with the cisterns which we afterwards examined. Of all that is now to be seen at Constantinople, there remains nothing but these subterraneous works that bear the stamp of Roman greatness. The first that I observed contained some water. The supporting columns of the vaulted roofs were large and handsome, but I could not ascer tain their number; formerly a palace stood over this cistern, but its ruins have disappeared, scarcely a trace * This brazen column is supposed to be of extreme antiquity, and to have originally supported the Tripod at Delphi. (_\".)"], [132, "70 TURKEY. of them remaining to mark the spot. The cistern of the thirty-two columns being dry, it is occupied by work men who spin yarn for shoemakers. These columns, which are of the Doric order, are equally handsome and lofty as those I saw in the other cistern, and doubtless served in the same manner for the foundations of a palace, though there are not any remains to confirm this hypothesis. Lastly, we repaired to that caUed the Cistern of the Thousand Columns*. There are three hundred of them which support the arches, and the space they occupy is very extensive. It is here that the silk-spinners carry on theh work; and it is imagined that above this cistern stood the palace of Constantine ; the extent of the subterranean works which I have just described seeming to warrant this opinion. But the palace of the monarch, like the habitations of his sub jects, has been unable to resist the destroying effect of ages, united to the efforts which the passions and cu pidity of man produce. We know that time wUl make havoc on the structures of antiquity, yet it wUl leave a stamp of greatness on the fragments that remain, and the imagination then may paint the past in aU its mag nificence and splendour; but man destroys even the ruins, and obhterates the works which centuries have respected. If the remains of the ancient palaces and other buildings had been used like those of Rome, in the re-construction of a crowd of monuments, we might feel the less regret; but with the exception of a few portions of the waUs of the city, and of some mosques wherein they have been used as mere materials, they are nowhere to be found. * It is called the \" Bin-bir-Direk\" Cistern, (r.)"], [133, "71 CONSTANTINOPLE. We saw the Column of Constantine, possessing no beauty, and in many fragments.* We then returned to the great bazaar, which we thoroughly examined. The quantity of merchandise it contains is immense and of great value. Being deshous of seeing the Slave Market, we next proceeded thither. It is a distressing spectacle, for no difference is made between the sale of a brute and that of a human being. The unfortunate captives are ex posed in cells, which open on a covered gaUery. The purchasers make theh circuit of the whole, examine, compare, select, and bargain, as their taste or judgment may decide. * The worthy Dr. Seng, a true philan thropist, was at first most sensibly affected by this disgusting and distressing scene. To the moralist and Christian it is a most revolting sight, and regarded as a temporary state of the individual it inspires the greatest pity ; but yet, considered as his final lot, slavery in the East has nothing in it mournful or toilsome. It is, indeed, the opposite of these, for it is a system of adoption, which by incorporating the slave in his master's farndy, attaches him to that master's destiny, and puts him in the path of fortune. The slave knows that his master has unlimited power over him, but it is exercised directly, and free from the interference of others, for even the most docUe rejects with indigna tion any order which his master has not personaUy given him, and he feels placed immeasurably above the level of a free or hired servant.

He often overloads him with favours, gives him his confi- dence, and raises his position; and when the master is powerful he opens to his slave the path of honour, and launches him upon the stream of pubhc functions. If we need an instance in support of the truth of this assertion, let us look around the Sultan, and observe who are the most distinguished men within his empire. Khosrew Pacha, the old Seraskier, the man who has governed and ruled aU things in Constantinople, was a slave from the Caucasus, purchased by a Capudan Pacha, whose protection has raised him to the highest offices.* Hahl Pacha, the son-in-law and most dis tinguished servant of the Sultan, and to whom the brightest prospects are opened, was a slave to the Seraskier. f On first entering the slave market we were deeply moved by feelings of pity, but when this impression was in some degree abated, and our spirits admitted of our making observations, we remarked an extraordi- * Khosrew Pacha has no ostensible employment at present (1838), but he lives in great state in the true Turkish style, at his \" Yali,\" or residence, on the shoie of the Bosphorus, about midway between Con stantinople and Buyuk-dere. He is to be seen there daily, sitting with Mussulman patience and Ottoman appreciation of the beauties of nature, wrapped up in caftans, and surrounded by a herd of idlers, whom every great man in Turkey is under the necessity of supporting. It is said however, that this shrewd old man still exercises considerable influence in the councils ofthe Sultan. (T.) \u2022f* Halil Pacha, having gone through the unenviable career that leads to honours in Turkey, married the Sultan's eldest daughter, the Sultana Salieh. He was, in the spring of the present year, 1838, deprived of his post of Commander-in-Cliief of the Turkish army in Europe.

They seemed to be aware that they were in a state of tran sition, as an introduction to a new course of life, which might be brilliant or obscure, according to the wUl of God. They conceive their destiny to be pre-ordained, and they thus await it with confidence and resigna tion. We Europeans are born more or less fortunate, in a higher or lower condition, as fate may decree \u25a0 but the natives of the East, when sold as slaves, have as it were a double birth, for they are twice the butt of chance. The Turkish habits not only protect the slaves and give them a peaceful existence, but the laws afford them the fuUest protection. If an owner abuses his power over a slave, the latter complains to a Cadi, who on proof of the offence, dhects that he shall be sold, and thus relieves him from the thraldom of being subject to the cruelty of a bad master. Moreover, corporal punishments cannot be inflicted on a slave, directly, by order of the owner ; for it is only at the stated that Halil's removal had taken place in consequence of his neglect of dut}-, and inattention to the repeated admonitions of his sovereign. But it was rumoured that the real cause was opposition to the Sultan's wish to commence hostilities against Mehemed-Ali, the Viceroy of Egypt. Yet this report is at variance with Halil Pacha's supposed subserviency to Russia, which Power it was imagined was then exer cising its influence to urge the Sultan into those hostihties. Another motive of a private nature has also been assigned for this act of the Grand Signor, that is, Halil's neglect of his royal wife ; but as she is now exerting her influence for her husband's restoration to power, it is possible that there is not much foundation for this latter statement.

The black or Abyssi nian slaves are exposed in the public bazaars, but the whites of both sexes are kept apart, to be seen only by Mussulmans ; they alone being privileged to purchase them. Among the slaves I remarked a Negress in great distress. Near her was a Turkish female, who seemed, as far as I was enabled to judge, a handsome person, but with a countenance that at the same time bespoke cruelty and anger. I asked the former the cause of her grief, and in an instant her mistress, the Turkish woman, replied that the slave was to be beaten for having raised the hand against her. The accused denied the charge and prayed for pardon. I besought the pity and commiseration of the Turkish woman, who, although at first astonished at my interference, finally acceded to my wish, and granted the forgiveness I requested. On leaving the bazaar we passed the Seraskier's palace, situated on the most elevated part of the penin sula. It has a tower, from the summit of which the whole of the city may be seen. This palace was for merly used as a prison for those princes of the Otto man family who had claims to the throne. It is believed that the Greek emperors inhabited it in the latter days of their power. We afterwards inspected an estabhshment for the reception of insane persons.

There is not a single instance of one of them being restored to reason ; and those who may not have been altogether deprived of their senses before admission, are soon driven into a state of incurable insanity.* The feeling soul of Dr. Seng was roused, and with just cause, to the greatest pitch of indigna tion, at the attrocities which we here witnessed. I wish that, for his consolation, and to efface the distress ing remembrance of these scenes, he had, like myself, been so fortunate as to see the mad-house at Palermo. I know nothing of the kind in Europe to be compared with this, the most perfect work of an enlightened plulanthropy ; it is conducted on the principles of Dr. GaU, by a man gifted with superior intelligence, unwearied patience, and a gentleness of disposition such as is rarely met with. Mr. Pesani, the director of the house, employs no violent means, for he speedily acquires an hresistible moral influence over the unfor tunate persons committed to his care. They obey his voice, are constantly employed in useful occupations, and enjoy as much happiness as their cruel state per mits. The result of his wise and salutary system is the cure of two-fifths of the unhappy patients. From the establishment of the insane we proceeded to the site of the Janissaries' barracks, which were burnt in the revolution of 1826. * That alluded to by the author is probably the one attached to the Mosque of Soliman, and if so, deserving of the description he has given of it. But it should be borne in mind that insanity is often beheved to be feigned in Turkey, in the hope of escaping the punishment deserved for some offence, and that prisoners are often sent to these \"Timar Khans\" by the judges, instead of the infliction of the more rigorous sentences justified by law.

This living solitude, if thus I may express myself, is left to stamp on the memory of the people the suppres sion of the revolt and the chastisement inflicted on the rebels, the severity of which has been much exagge rated. There were in Constantinople, at the period in question, eighteen or twenty thousand Janissaries, and these undisciphned troops had long prescribed laws to their masters. Discontent suddenly broke out among them; the Sultan was without defenders, and his life appeared to be in danger. He appealed to his people, asserted his rights, and his voice was heard. He had had the foresight to appoint as Muphti a man on whom he could rely, and in the day of peril he proved him self worthy of his sovereign's confidence. A \" fetvah\"* of the Muphti decreed that the sacred Standard should be raised, and directed all good Mussulmans to arm in defence of theh religion and the throne. They assem bled on the \" Atmeidan,\" t where the Ulemas and the great officers of the empire pitched their tents, and marched against the rebels, who had entrenched them selves in the immense barracks which they occupied near this spot. Three pieces of cannon fired upon and destroyed the gates, and a combat of short duration ensued. A dreadful fire soon consumed the whole of the the buildings, which were merely of wood, and terror having seized the Janissaries, they dispersed in all directions. Three hundred of them perished in the battle, and the leaders were pursued and put to death ; but persons weU informed of all the facts, and capable of judging of them, without having any interest in disguising the truth, gave me an assurance that not * The literal meaning of the word \" Fetvah,\" is award, decree, sen tence, verdict, or decision.

It has been asserted, however, that the number amounted to eight or ten thousand, and some credit is attached to this statement : but I beheve it must not be relied upon, for the Eastern nations, and especially the Turks, having no just idea of numbers, employ them in their descriptions without accuracy or discern ment, and it is their habitual practice to exaggerate. Moreover it is a part of the policy of the government to give currency to this popular error, in order to inspire the greater terror. The Sultan showed much resolution, but his life was on the cast, and he seemed to have no other course to take than that which he adopted. The dangers which surrounded him were great, for at first he had no one to support him ; but a sovereign is not long without defenders when sustained by pubhc opinion, and when he calls the people to his aid. Thus did it happen on that occasion : the resist ance His Highness encountered was but slight, because the arrogant Janissaries, like aU undisciplined and factious troops, had ceased to be courageous. Their assailants scarcely lost a hundred men, and thus the dreaded power of this corps, that had nearly under mined the Turkish empire, vanished in a moment.* * The author is quite correct in saying that the accounts of this remarkable event have been much exaggerated, hut still there is reason to beheve that between 1400 and 1500 Janissaries were killed at Con stantinople. Some statements have been made that in the entire empire fifty thousand perished, but these are devoid of truth. Hussein Pacha, a chief of the Janissaries, is said to have been the Sultan's principal adviser in his attack ou that turbulent body, and he was ably assisted by one of his lieutenants. An anecdote is told of Hussein having offered his own head to the Sultan, when he informed His Hi\u00b0*hness that all the other Janissaries of the empire had been destroyed. The term \" Janissary\" is derived from a corruption of the words"], [140, "78 TURKEY. At a short distance from the spot where the barrack above-mentioned stood, is the aqueduct of Valens. This work has neither magnificence nor grandeur. We then went to the column of Marcian, which, though finely proportioned, is composed of two pieces. In the vicinity is the site of another Janissary barrack that was also destroyed : \u2014 the space is stUl covered with its ashes. From thence we proceeded to the tomb of Constan tine, passing in our route the mosque of Sultan Ma homet the Second, and also the site of an old mosque of the same name, which probably was one of the early Greek churches. There are but few remains to indicate the spot where the founder of this city was interred. We took the road that passes the old mosque of Seyreck, and closed this long tour by embarking at the stairs of Natkapu, and thence proceeding through Top-hana to Pera. The foUowing day, the 18th, was Friday \u2014 on that day of every week the Sultan attends worship at the mosque;* and, having been informed that on this occasion he would proceed to one on the Asiatic shore, I embarked and hastened thither.

The males were enrolled in the mUitary troops of which we speak, and being compelled to adopt Islam ism, a Dervish of great sanctity gave his blessing, calling them the \" Yeni Cheri,\" an appellation they retained till its corruption into Janissary.\" (T.) * Friday is the Turkish Sabbath.

It is followed by another boat equally handsome, and the poop of each is covered by a magnificent crimson canopy. On quitting the shore, the Sultan is saluted by the whole of the fleet, each ship of war firing twenty-one guns. When dynasties are fading, etiquette becomes the substitute for power : human nature, always inclined to shrink from the confession of its real weakness, clings to the external signs of strength when the reality has ceased; and monarchs are disposed to seek for homage when they can no longer show their greatness by theh noble acts. At the period of the lower Empire this same country presented such another picture. The boats passed through the water with the swift ness of an arrow, and as if by magic reached the shore to which they steered. The Sultan disembarked and entered the mosque; but being then at too great a distance to see him distinctly, I placed myself in a suitable position for observing him on his return. A part of one of the cavalry regiments of the guards, dismounted, was drawn up in line in front of the mosque, and a numerous body of officers, of an irre gular appearance, had assembled on the spot. After remaining about twenty minutes in the mosque, the Sultan quitted it, and mounted his horse.

Being informed of my presence, he looked at me several times with much attention. His retinue consisted of several Generals, among whom were the Seraskier, the Capudan Pacha, and Hahl-Pacha, the Sultan's son-in-law. According to custom, perfumes were burnt before him. He proceeded to the barrack to inspect the regiment quartered there, and I set out for Scutari, a suburb on the Asiatic side. It is very extensive, and the streets are wider than those of Constantinople, Pera, or Galata. The most beautiful and spacious quarter, and the most deserving of inspection, is that aUotted for the dead, to the southward of the town. This cemetery is immense, and its cypress trees are so large and numerous that they form a magnificent wood, giving an impressive and mournful character to the scene. Respect for the departed is a virtuous feeling in a people, but the Turks carry it to such an extent that they are more occupied about the dead than about the living. Women are frequently observed at the cemetery weeping over their husband's or their chil dren's tombs, and Friday is especiaUy devoted to this pious act. This place of sepulture is not exclusively appropriated to those who have been inhabitants of Scutari, for many Turks who had resided at Constantinople have been buried here.

Intending to avad myself of some future opportunity of carefuUy examining the barrack at Scutari, I merely gave it a passing glance, and perceived it to be an immense square budding, capable of lodging ten thou sand men.* From thence we went to see the few remaining ruins of the ancient town of Chalcedon, where a celebrated Council was formerly held. It was also the rendezvous for the Crusaders, under Doge Dandolo, before they landed on the coast of Europe, to under take the sacrilegious siege of a place that they should have regarded with a friefedly eye.f From this point, which juts into the sea, there is a beautiful view, embracing the whole extent of Constantinople and the Seven Towers. Like the Fresh Waters, it is a fashionable promenade, and the scene of festive parties. J Not far from hence the Sultan has a country-house, which he occasionaUy inhabits.

A part of the vUla is devoted to an audience chamber, and at each angle of the principal apartment there is a retiring room.

Lastly, the Sultan appeared, with a suite of three or four hundred persons, and was announced by numerous salvos of artUlery, fired by the ships of war and answered by the guns of Top-hana. The chamberlains and officers of the Sultan's personal staff, and twelve horses, superbly caparisoned, preceded him, and he was followed by pages on horseback, having head dresses covered with feathers, and by others on foot, bearing battle-axes, and wearing casques, surmounted by numerous plumes of a crestlike form. The Sultan was mounted on a beautiful bay horse, which he rode graceftdly and in the European style. His dress was not remarkable for its richness, and he wore his customary brown cloak, embroidered round the collar. * The \" Kavasses\" are a sort of police. No man of official rank in Turkey ever moves out without being attended by some of them.

But, gene rally speaking, they wear the hideous uniform of the frock coat, in various colours, according to the taste of the Ambassador they serve. They all carry swords, and bear a long white staff of office, which they use rather unceremoniously on any troublesome person who falls in their way, particularly when the unfortunate being happens to be a Jew, the worst of all infidels in the eyes of a true believer.

After examining this fort, we went out at what is caUed the \"Gate of the Seven Towers;\" and inspected the tomb of Mustapha Bairactar. He was a great character, notwithstanding his fadure in the case of the Sultan Sehm, one of the most enlightened sovereigns that the Turks ever had, and whose death was unfortunately hastened by Mustapha Bairactar, in his attempt to restore him to power. The inanimate body of the Sultan was thrown to him, as he was forcing open the gates of the seraglio for his master's dehverance : but he overturned the throne of the nephew and successor, Sultan Mustapha, at whose command Sehm had been put to death, and in his stead he placed the reigning sovereign.* Shortly after wards, the Janissaries having risen against Mustapha Bairactar, he defended himself long and bravely, but being at last attacked in his house, he sprung a mine, which was in readiness, and buried himself with many of his enemies in the ruins of the building. When I commanded in Dalmatia, he was stationed at Widdin, on the Danube, and we were not only in correspondence on affairs of state, but by deshe of Napoleon I sent officers of my staff to him. He was unquestionably a man of energy and courage; but he was proud and haughty, and he declined the succours I offered. His mind was far from being of a comprehensive character, and like Turks in general, he was profoundly ignorant. As an extraordinary instance of this, he asked one of my officers whether, in passing through Dalmatia to the Danube, he had crossed the sea !

We looked into the Church of Fishes, thus named from its enclosing a subterraneous fountain which contains fish. This spring is much reverenced by the Greeks, and wonderful stories are told respecting it. We repaired to the gateway of Selivri, where the heads of Ali Pacha of Joanina, and his sons and grand sons are kept. In the years 1806 and 1807, I was in daily commu nication with Ah Pacha, who, from having been a common robber, had risen to the rank of vizier, and had almost become an independent sovereign. His energy, cunning, and cruelty are weU known, and have rendered him as celebrated as the catastrophe that closed his days.

At the period of the Peace of Tilsit, and when hos tUities were known to have been suspended on the Niemen, having determined to request Napoleon to give him the Ionian Islands, he sent to the Emperor a confidential agent, who came to me, in passing through Dalmatia, and stated the object of his mission. The selection of the ambassador was as singular as the argument he used in support of his petition. He was a Roman, whom in our way to Egypt we found at Malta, exercising the functions of inquisitor. He accompanied us to Alexandria, but becoming disgusted with the country, he determined to leave it, and with this view embarked with two French officers, Colonels Charbonnel and Poitevin, one of whom is stUl living.

The foUowing is the argument this agent used with Napoleon, by his Highness's direction : \u2014 \" AU Pacha is a friend to the French. The Emperor is about to get possession of Corfu, and will send a General to command the place. That officer will quarrel with the Pacha, who wUl be accused of enmity to the French, which will be false; to prevent this state of things, it wdl be better to bestow Corfu upon the Pacha.\" It did not require a great effort of Napoleon's mind to answer such logic ; and, without touching upon the soundness of the argument, he merely replied, \" But I have not Corfu, and how am I to take it?\" The rejoinder of the Roman was, \" Your Majesty wUl have it.\" Thrice did the Emperor repeat the words, \" I have it not, and how am I to take it ?\" and then dis missed the emissary, leaving to Ali Pacha the mortifi cation of having to pay the expense of this man's fruitless journey. I attentively examined that part of the enceinte of the city near the Selivri Gate, and found it to consist of a rampart flanked by towers, with a good ditch, and here and there a \"fausse braie.\" We then passed on to the Adrianople Gate and the Gate of Cannons. AU this portion of the fortifications is in three lines, but not having been repahed since the time of Mahomet the Second, they are now in a ruinous state.* * It may be here remarked that the outer hne was built at the period of the Emperor Theodosius ; that this, as well as the enclosure walls, washed by the waters of the Golden Horn and the Propontis, have remained without much augmentation or diminution for upwards of four teen centuries ; and that the 29 gates of communication through them have been undisturbed.

We returned by the same entrance, and then continued along the waU until we reached the sea on the right side of the harbour, where the palace of Blaquerney formerly stood. The smaU interval separating the ramparts from the port is occupied by the houses which constitute the suburb of \" Fanar,\" at the north angle of the city. The Greeks, who play so important a part in aU the political intrigues connected with the Turkish Empire, reside in that quarter. These people fid the offices of interpreter to the Porte, and of Hospodars of Walachia and Moldavia. * The city was first attacked by the Saracens in the seventh century, when they were a great maritime power. Their operations were directed against the whole extent of the land front, which had been constructed by the Emperor Theodosius ; but its strength defied them, and after a fruitless siege of six years, they relinquished the attempt, their army having been nearly destroyed by famine and the sword. They repeatedly renewed their attacks, hut with equal want of success. Two expeditions against Constantinople were afterwards undertaken by the Scythians, in which they also failed. Subsequently the Crusaders made their successful attack. Then followed the attempt of the Turks under Bajazet, who for two years carried on a siege, which was inter rupted by the arrival of the Tartars under Tamerlane. Bajazet gave the invader battle on the plains of Angora, and was defeated and made prisoner. At length Mahomet' the Second besieged Constantinople with an army of 200,000 men. It is said that the number of the garrison did not exceed 8,000 men, therefore their defeat was inevitable ; but they, nevertheless, defended themselves with vigour on the land front, and the city resisted till it was assailed also on the sea hne, when it was carried by assault, and became the Turkish capital, after having been possessed by the Christians for upwards of eleven centuries.

He means that in the middle of the side of the triangle towards the Golden Horn, there is but a single line of defence, consisting of a very low wall. Now, the fact is, that the whole of that side has only a single hne, but instead of being a \" very low wall,\" it is one of con siderable altitude, being nearly thirty feet in height. He may have been deceived by the obstruction offered to his close inspection, in many parts of that line, by the houses built against the wall, and this seems the only way in which it is possible to reconcile this inaccuracy with the Marshal's reputation for precision. Along the sea of Marmora, the wall is of the same height, though rather in a state of decay \u2022 but from the Seraglio to the Seven Towers it is entire, \u2014 and in only one part (the quarter of the Armenian cloth dyers) are any houses in its front.

After having surveyed Constantinople in every direc tion, I felt the full force of the impression I had received in contemplating the view it presented from Scutari: \u2014 that in the heart of the city, as weU as at Pera, and in the other suburbs, we seem as much among the dead as with the living. In fact, the former seem to be the only objects of solicitude. Owing to the numerous and magnificent cypress trees that adorn the tombs, they present a much more pleasing picture, and form a more inviting shelter than the dwellings now inhabited by the living. We might conceive the population using words like these : \u2014 \" We lodge in ruins, walk amongst the tombs, and live sur rounded by the plague,\" for such is theh existence. Dr. Seng having a strong deshe to examine persons suffering from plague, and to study all the circum stances connected with that scourge, I pursued alone, on the 20th of July, my course of inspection of Con stantinople, while he visited the great hospital, which, being filled with the infected, afforded him the means of investigation and inquiry. I had avaded myself of a mournful opportunity of doing something of the same kind, in the course of the five months I was at Alex andria, and felt no deshe to repeat the melancholy task. I went early to Buyuk-dere, where Baroness Stunner gave a baU, at which I had an opportunity of judging of the state of society in Constantinople. It is confined to the families of merchants, and of the diplomatic body. I met with several very agree able women at this party : but those who have enjoyed unparalleled in the history of a Christian people.

On the 21st I surveyed that part of the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus, on which a division of the Russian army encamped, when sent to the Sultan's support in the year 1833, and whose presence secured his throne.* A monument, bearing an inscription, * The encampment was on the heights opposite to Buyuk-dere and Therapia; this ground forms part of the Giant's Mountain, whose base touches the sea at UnMar Skelessi (the Sultan's landing-place), which gives its name to the celebrated treaty entered into between Russia and the Sublime Porte, on the 26th of June, 1833 \u25a0 a brief outhne of which may not be here deemed misplaced. This treaty consists of six openly acknowledged articles, and one to which secrecy was attached, for it did not form part of what is called the patent treaty, and though entered into at the same period, was not communicated to the British Government until the 16th of January, 1831. In the first six articles the contracting parties enter into a treaty of defensive alliance; declaring that there shall be perpetual peace and amity hetween the Emperor of all the Russias and the Emperor of the Ottomans, and all their subjects ; that the treaty has for its only object the defence of their respective dominions against all attacks, in the fulfil ment of wliich they engage to afford to each other substantial aid, and the most efficacious assistance ; that the treaty of Peace of Adrianople, dated the 2nd of Sept. 1829, and all the other treaties therein comprised, also the convention of St. Petersburg, of the 14th of April, 1830, and the arrangement relating to Greece, concluded at Constantinople on the 9th and 21st of July, 1832, are confirmed by this treaty. That from a most sincere desire to secure the permanence, main tenance, and entire independence of the SubUme Porte, the Emperor of all the Russias engages, if required for the defence of the Ottoman dominions, to furnish hy land and by sea as many troops and forces as may be deemed necessary, by the two high contracting powers.

I then went to the summit of the Giant's Mountain, from whence a commanding view is obtained of the Euxine, and the Sea of Marmora, but the prospect, though of immense extent, is much less beautiful than that from Boulgourlou. There is a ridiculous tradition of a giant, fifty feet in That the treaty shall remain in force eight years, and that pre viously to the expiration of that term, the two parties will concert together as to its renewal, according to the then state of affairs. The secret article is of vast importance to the maritime powers of Europe, and, in order that it may be duly appreciated, it is thought necessary to translate it at length : \u2014 \" By virtue of one of the clauses of the first article of the present treaty of defensive alliance, concluded between the Imperial Court of Russia and the Sublime Porte, the two high contracting parties are bound to afford to each other, mutually, substantial aid and the most efficacious assistance, for the safety of their respective dominions. Never theless, as his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, wishing to spare the Sublime Ottoman Porte the expense and inconvenience which might be occasioned to it by affording substantial aid, will not ask for that aid if circumstances should place the Sublime Porte under the obligation of furnishing it, the Sublime Porte, in the place of the aid which it is bound to furnish in case of need, according to the principle of reciprocity of the patent treaty, shall confine its action in favour of the Imperial Court of Russia to closing the Strait of the Dardanelles, that is to say, to not allowing any foreign vessel of war to enter therein, under any pretext whatsoever.\" From the letter of the treaty, and its secret article, it has been generally considered that the exclusion of foreign ships of war from the Dardanelles would only take place in the commonly understood \" case of need,\" of the existence of hostihties between the contracting parties (Turkey and Russia), and any other maritime powers; but the spirit adopted and acted upon carries the principle to the exclusion at all times, of the ships of war of all nations, but those of Turkey and Russia, giving thereby to the latter the supremacy in the Black Sea, and a facility, at her pleasure, of attacking Constantinople on the most vulnerable and accessible side.

Her strength in the middle ages was the result of her civilization, commerce, and nautical skill.* I saw the Cyanean islands, two rocks that might be armed for the defence of the canal ; but its own shores present throughout points equally advantageous for such a purpose, and therefore they are to be preferred.

They came as mer chants, and their efforts were productive of an increase of wealth to the Empire. They carried on an extensive fishery in the Crimea, and were allowed to establish themselves for the sale of their commodities at Galata (so called from its having been the milk market of the Greeks). Their town increased, and they were permitted to inclose it with defensible walls, which still exist. They had their separate form of government, and practised the rites of their own religion. The language of Italy was introduced by them, and formed the basis of the \" Lingua Franka,\" now generally spoken. The persons selected for dragomans by the European embassies, are descendants of these people, and are the most respectable class of inhabitants of Constantinople. The old eastle, to which the author alludes, is situated on the top of a lofty projecting cape, upwards of three thousand yards distant from the Giant's Mountain, and from its picturesque appearance and commanding position it adds greatly to the beauty of the surrounding scenery. It might, without much difficulty, be put into a state to contribute to the defence of the Bosphorus, by preparing it as a post for the security of the high ground in rear of the adjacent sea batteries. There is at present a considerable fort at the foot of the eminence crowned by the castle. (T.)"], [156, "94 TURKET. Buyuk-dere and Therapia, I returned to Pera. My feUow-traveller, Dr. Seng, who had visited many of the hospitals, informed me that the plague had extended itself to an alarming degree ; and that the various asylums for the sick presented the most frightful picture of all the miseries that can afflict humanity. On the 23rd I paid a visit to the Seraskier Khosrew. Although we had never met, we were weU known to each other by report ; for in the years 1806 and 1807, when he was the Pacha of Bosnia, war was carrying on between the Servians and the Porte, and Napoleon having directed me to give the Pacha any aid that he required, I sent him arms and ammunition, from which resulted a good understanding between us. He received me with peculiar attention, embraced me several times, and hugged me almost to suffocation. I did not expect so warm a reception. We spoke of our former inti macy, and of the wars in which I had been engaged in my youth, particularly the campaigns in Italy ; and on his producing a work relating to those immortal trans actions, as a proof that I had taken part in them, I showed him my name, in the account of the battle of Castiglione, where, although at the time I was very young, I commanded the whole of the horse artiUery of the army. He told me that he should have the chapter relating to that event translated into Turkish, and should keep it as a valued treasure. The Seraskier expressed great regret at hearing that my stay at Con stantinople was to be short, and said that, notwith standing my early departure, the Sultan wished to see me, and would give me notice of the time appointed for the audience. In fact it took place a few days sub sequently to our conversation, without my having made a formal application for it."], [157, "95 CONSTANTINOPLE. The Seraskier Khosrew has played too important a part in the affairs of the Turkish Empire to justify my passing him without some special notice. He was born in that part of the Caucasian range caUed Abasia, was purchased in his infancy by Kutchuk-Hussein, the cele brated Capudan Pacha, and brought up in the house of his master, who soon opened to him the road to fortune and distinction. Having been appointed Pacha of Caho, after the retreat of the French army, he governed in Egypt for some length of time. But Mehemet Ah, who then served in the Turkish army as a simple \"Bim bachi,\" or chief of a battalion, having found the means of rendering himself of importance, and of acquiring con siderable influence, revolted, and drove Khosrew from Caho, pursuing him to Damietta, where he compeUed him to embark; and this is the cause of the inex tinguishable hatred the Seraskier bears towards Mehe met Ah. On the return of Khosrew to Constantinople he was appointed Pacha of Bosnia, and employed suc cessfully in the war with the Servians. Afterwards he was raised to the dignity of Capudan Pacha, and at a later period having been sent to Trebizonde, with orders to march against the Persians, he met with nothing but reverses. Subsequently he returned to his office of Capudan Pacha, and commanded the fleet during tbe war with Greece. Notwithstanding the great means at his disposal, he was unsuccessful, and extraordinary misfortunes befeU him ; but he gave the Sultan powerful assistance in the destruction of the Janissaries, and enthusiasticaUy adopted the project of raising the new troops. Though he devoted aU his energies in carrying it into effect, yet being deficient of the requisite knowledge he was unable to give them a good direction, and this new force, whose chief he"], [158, "96 TURKEY. was appointed, has acquired neither value nor stabi lity. From that time he has commanded at Constan tinople, and skilfully maintained the peace of that great city. Khosrew is said to be nearly eighty years of age. He is short, thick-set, and active ; of a strong and vigour ous constitution; quick, acute, and subtle; his look penetrating ; and no one is more fitted to conduct com plicated political intrigues. He is a singular instance of a man having passed through a long series of years, under various monarchs, in the midst of changes and bloody revolutions of aU descriptions, adding to his power and importance, without ever performing any great action to awaken admiration, or entitle him to public gratitude. In the pursuit of his objects he has never put in motion any of the nobler springs which adorn the human heart ; and he is said to have been more engaged in forwarding his private interest, than the service of his country or his master. Khosrew has recently been deprived of the dignity of Seraskier; but in retiring, he retains the confidence and favour of the Sultan. On leaving the house of the Seraskier, I went to the barrack at Scutari, to see Namik Pacha and the brigade of the guards under his command. This fine establishment is capable of containing ten thousand men ; it is situated on high ground,* and is represented as being extremely healthy. It shape is that of an * This barrack would not contain above five thousand British troops, according to the extent of accommodation deemed indispensable to health; but Turkish soldiers are accustomed to be more crowded in their rooms; and therefore, the buildings in question would probably hold as many as eight thousand of these men ; certainly not more.

While waiting the arrival of Achmet Pacha, the Mouschir, or commander-in-chief of the guards, I examined the interior of the barrack, and made inqui ries respecting the diet of the soldiers. Namik Pacha, who did the honours, is a very distinguished, polished, active, and well-informed young man ; and, amongst other accomplishments, he speaks French fluently. He is very deshous of seeing his country raised from its present state of abasement. His opinions are judicious and sensible, and his mind enlightened. In short, he is a phenomenon in this part of the world, and is there fore the object of general envy* The Use of the Turkish soldiers is a very happy one. * Namik Pacha is the person who was so much esteemed in England, France, and other civilized countries of Europe, for his quick perception and admiration of our enlightenment, and it was hoped that on his return to Turkey, he would have had sufficient influence and zeal for his country's advancement, to have brought about the adoption of many of our customs and institutions ; but so far is this from being the case, that it is stated he has evinced, or pretended to feel, a hearty contempt for everything European, and has maintained the all-sufficiency of the Turks for the salvation of their country. But Namik Pacha has not proved the truth of this position by effecting an improvement in the public departments; to the defective state of which he could not have been blind, if he deserve any of the praise that was lavished upon him in Christendom. He obtained from the Sultan only a very subordinate employment, considering the important post he had filled in the West and North of Europe : for he went to Tripoli, in Asia Minor, in the capacity of a General of Brigade of the expedition under the command of the brave and intrepid Tahir Pacha. He had a disagreement with his chief was removed from his position, and has not since been employed. Tahir Pacha returned to Constantinople, and was appointed to a very lucrative and important office; but he was afterwards removed to an inferior one, and finally thrown altogether out of employment. These are illustrations of the uncertainty of royal favour in Turkey. (T.) F"], [160, "98 TURKEY. They are better fed than any other troops in Europe, having an abundance of provisions, of excellent quahty, and partaking of meat once, and of soup twice a day. Their magazines are fiUed with stores, and the regiments have large reserves. The pay of each soldier is twenty piasters per month ; the whole of which he receives, as there is a prohibition against withholding from him any part of that sum. In short, every thing has been effected that could promote the welfare of the soldier. If no fault can be found on the score of the \"mate- riel,\" much is to be said against the \" personel \" of this force. On the arrival of Achmet Pacha, we repaired to the exercising ground. Four battalions were in hne, and after inspecting them, they man\u0153uvred before me. Nothing could be worse than this exhibition ; indeed these men ought not to be looked upon as troops, but merely as a mass of people, grouped together and bear- ing the stamp of humiliation : and they are evidently depressed by a knowledge of theh own incapacity. They all seem to have a wiUingness about them, but seem to feel ashamed of theh occupation ; and from the private to the colonel, not an individual amongst them has any conception of his duty. Moreover, the men are diminutive in stature as weU as wretched in appear- ance : and many of them are too young for service. We are led to inquire what has become of that noble Turkish people, the lofty, proud, majestic, handsome race of former days, for now we find no trace of them in the existing troops. I have endeavoured to discover why they have not hitherto succeeded better with the new system, and I thus account for the faUure. The Sultan was desirous of organizing troops according to the European mode, and his ambition was to form an army on the instant."], [161, "CON-I.'.N If I.. .,, lu ai-cordinelr raised \u25a0 BgKQaJ nnoitiai fifj'Cgj tH.OO.tS3 bur the iusfmetor.-s being iii.;i-!\\ iridiviiluflJs u| nu tiiifi-i it- Station of life, without 1.. . itj Ut ;l :n. \" '\"' had (JCCU ledto(.'\"ii-.ti'iiliiO|'\"k- bj ll.e i i;v- , I'vtiULTS which attend revolutions, \\urc unv I tt . \u25a0 .,l,-|. the object 111 \u25a0 u'M T Lc new orgrmr/.aiioii commenced M:uuif-m' '..n.-dy in all the \u25a0\u25a0< itps ; and tiro S\u00abiBe doSCripti '' Jl . \u2022 D | . uiiivt-j-.-ially einple'ved iu cudcaeonri, ig in cam ic mtu effect, la until' nf the grad \u25a0-. faifl auy i wti couHdoivce either in hiuiscU'ur iu others, and no out Ehvttfbro bad a right to command, uhick should always Li/ derived (Vein SDHUe superior rlaiLLi.

As to the right derived from merit or experience. there can be none where all are novices, Such were the radical dc seers that prevailed in the fomwtiiin of the Turkish army. The remedy would be to reduce things to their elements, and to recommence by establishing, in public opinion, a respect for talent and capacity, iu order to obtaiu that obedience and t 'J"], [162, "100 TURKEY. confidence, without which an army cannot exist ; for it is such confidence that produces discipline and order, and creates the moral power requisite to give unity, compactness, and energy to the whole. If, instead of attempting to raise an army, as it were, by a mere decree, the Sultan had been content with form ing a single battalion, and had obtained the services of thirty or forty really good officers, and a chief capable of comprehending the importance of his duties, it is probable that, in two years, he would have succeeded in producing a battalion to serve as a model for the rest, and this result once obtained, the Sultan would have possessed the elements required. At the end of six months, or at the utmost of one year, by adding to the number of those first enroUed, and dividing the whole into two battalions, he might have formed a com plete regiment, for the men of the first levy would, in the eyes of the recruits, have appeared as old and instructed soldiers. It is obvious that in ten years he would thus have obtained an army. Whereas, accord ing to the system followed, such a result is improbable, for a union of men like the present cannot be said to merit this title. When Peter the Great wished to form his troops in Russia, he adopted the principle that I have above de scribed, and he pushed its details even to excess. The right of commanding was based alone upon a known, or a supposed capacity for such employment, and the titles to promotion in every grade were seniority and service. Like all great men, he felt the necessity of setting an example, to convince those with whom he had to deal, and it is on record that he entered the army as a drummer, and passed successively through all the other ranks. Although he did not abdicate his"], [163, "CONSTANTINOPLE. 101 political power, he contented himself, so far as con cerned his mUitary position, with the exercise of those functions which by his actual services he believed he could justify in the soldiers' eyes. Thus at the battle of Pultowa he was a Major-general, and fought in that grade. In the northern European nations, where it may be said that true military principles are preserved in aU theh purity, and the profession of the soldier is viewed with the respect to which it is entitled, the sovereign's son commences in its lowest station, performing in each a positive service, and, by being placed in contact with the men, he acquires a knowledge of their feelings, and of aU the details connected with their duty. He does not, as in some countries, supersede aU other persons, and step into the command of armies, without having previously learned the principles of this difficult office : \u2014 one demanding in the highest degree, and at a given time, the exercise of aU the inteUigence and faculties that Providence has bestowed on man. What can be more reasonable or useful than to incul cate in the mind of the soldier, whom we lead to a probable death, the conviction that it is not in absolute waste, but for the glory of his country, that his blood is to be shed ? There are no other means of obtaining from him the wiUing exercise of aU his energies. In France, especially, this is an absolute necessity, because the soldier being inteUigent, calculates, reasons, judges, and conducts himself according to the result he foresees. I could cite many instances to prove the truth of this assertion, but that it is foreign to my subject. After the man\u0153uvring of the infantry, I went to Scutari with Achmet Pacha, to see the cavalry bar rack and the regiment stationed there. This corps"], [164, "102 TURKEY. is also attached to the guards, and forms part of a brigade commanded by Reschid Pacha, a eunuch; \u2014 A black eunuch as a general of brigade ! In Turkey it does not seem contrary to reason to invest with a mihtary dignity requiring strength, energy, and courage, a degraded being whose condition implies weakness and pusiUanimity, and who can never be sup posed to acquire an ascendency over the minds of other men. The soldiers in this cavalry regiment are armed with swords and lances, and are finer men than the infantry. I did not see them man\u0153uvre, but they seemed not to have bad seats, and theh horses, though small, appeared to be of a serviceable description. Achmet Pacha, who is the Commander-in-Chief of the guards, is intelligent, obliging, well-disposed, and diffident ; but he is indebted for his rapid elevation to the caprice and favour of his master. These are as they ever have been, the grand introductions to important offices. Achmet Pacha, like the \"generality of Turks, commenced life as an artisan. He was a shoemaker and also a waterman of the port. I was told that while on an embassy at St. Petersburg, where he was treated with great respect, he on one occasion went to see the barracks, when in passing a workshop of the guards he could not resist the desire of displaying his ability ; and quitting the cortege that accompanied him, he surprised every one by taking up a shoemaker's awl and stirrup, and giving an immediate proof that he had lost none of his former dexterity.* * A few months since the Sultan appointed Achmet Pacha to the office of Capudan Pacha or High Admiral. He has hoisted his flag in the finest ship of war, and should the fleet be engaged he will have to command it. It is easy to conceive how skilfully it will be managed, and what confidence the crews can have in such a cliief. (T.)"], [165, "103 CONSTANTINOPLE. On the 24th of July I went to the Porte to see the Grand Vizier, who received me with the usual cere monies. He is not more than 56 years of age, although he looks like an old man. Having exchanged common place civilities, taken coffee, a pipe, sweetmeats and per fumes, I retired to make another equally uninteresting visit to the Kiaja-Bey, or Minister of the Interior, where things passed much in the same way as at the Grand Vizier's. The Kiaja-Bey seems to be a man of austere man- ners. The Reis-Effendi, or Minister for foreign Affairs, being too unweU to admit me, I proceeded to the dock yard, where I was expected by the Capudan Pacha (Tahir) . This was a visit in which I took a deep inte rest. The Pacha is about fifty years of age ; handsome, weU-made, quick, and active ; has an ah of authority, and is evidently a person of capacity and exertion. He has been at sea, and is represented to have there fol lowed many callings. He gave me a very kind and unceremonious reception, in the way that one warrior should greet another. We examined the dock-yard, which is kept in good order, and well supphed with stores. A vessel of a peculiar form and of large dimen sions was budding under the dhection of an American ; but professional men had no great expectation of a favourable result. I saw a very excellent machine for flattening copper, which is worked by steam ; and I in spected two good basins for repairing ships, one con structed in the reign of Sehm III., and the other in that ofthe present Sultan.* * Selim I. may be considered as the founder of the Turkish navy, having caused the formation of the arsenal in the Golden Horn. He added Egypt to the Turkish empire, and in his reign its population"], [166, "104 TURKEY. After having thoroughly examined the arsenal, the Capudan Pacha proposed that I should visit the fleet, consisting of five ships completely armed ; I accepted the invitation to go on board the flag-ship only, the Mahmoudie, a three-decker, carrying 130 guns. Al though a magnificent vessel, she is considered rather short for her other proportions. In all Turkish men-of-war the guns are of brass, and that metal is elaborately used in theh interior decoration. I was much surprised at the wonderful expertness of the crew of the Mahmoudie, composed exclusively of Turks. By command of the Capudan Pacha, they per formed the smaU-arm and great-gun exercise, manned the yards, went aloft, and came down by the stays, the whole being done with a celerity and precision that could not have been surpassed by the smartest French sailors. On expressing my admhation to the Capudan Pacha, he replied : \" It is by dint of pains-taking and punishment, that I have brought things to this state, for there is not one of these fine feUows who has not received five hundred blows with the stick.\" It would appear that a severity of corporal punishment is suited to the Turkish character, for these men are thoroughly drUled in their exercise, and well disciplined ; and as there were at the period of my inspection only eight invalids in this crew of 1200 sailors, we may infer that in the system adopted there is nothing injurious to health. The Capudan Pacha is evidently a man of energy and received an accession of upwards of half a million of Jews, who had been expelled from Spain. A hundred thousand took up their residence in Constantinople, receiving that protection from the Sultan which he reluctantly afforded to his Christian subjects. The remainder settled in other parts of the Mahomedan dominion..

After returning home, Namik Pacha called to ac quaint me that the Grand Signor would receive me on the foUowing day, therefore on the 25th, at hah-past one o'clock, I repaired to the palace of Beyler-Bey, then the imperial residence. In this delightful habitation, which is of recent construction, the apartments are spacious, elegant, and cool. It is beautifuUy inclosed, on one side by the terraces formed on the mountain, and on the other by the sea. Though the style of architecture is hregular, it is pleasing to the eye, and possesses an agreeable character of originality. The Harem is composed of pavUions, having their gable ends in a hne with those of the main structure ; and handsome kiosks, placed at various levels on the ter races, are pleasing objects in the scenery around. Mahmoud has a passion for budding, which his archi tect encourages by causing it to be predicted that the Sultan should not die during the construction of a new palace, for God would not choose, by caUing him away, to leave his works unfinished; \u2014 hence, before the com pletion of one palace another is commenced.t * In a former note, adverting to Namik Pacha, the fate of Tahir, the Capudan Pacha, has incidentally been touched upon. It is to be regretted, by those who take an interest in Turkish advancement, that so valuable an officer should have been neglected.

On my arrival I was conducted into an apartment on the ground-floor, where I found assembled the Seras- kier, the Capudan Pacha, Achmet Pacha, Namik Pacha, Osman Pacha, and five or six others, with whom I con- versed for half an hour. I directed my attention chiefly to Osman Pacha, the Admiral who had precipitately quitted the service of Mehemed Ali. One reason given for his conduct was an act of severity perpetrated by his chief against the Greeks of Candia, in breach of a for- mal promise given to them by Osman Pacha, and ano- ther cause was the inveterate dislike of Ibrahim Pacha, a feeling resulting from his opinion of the incapacity or bad faith of Osman, when in command of the Egyp- tian fleet, at a time when its superiority over that of the Sultan placed the latter at his mercy. There was an ah of humility ancl embarrassment in his manner, which can easily be understood, for although received with courtesy, at the Sultan's court, no confidence was reposed in him, \u2014 the natural fate of a deserter. He was, however, a man of intelligence, and having Bosphorus. The private saloons of the Sultan, the state apartments, and those occupied by the household, are in an octagon-shaped building, whose pointed roof is surmounted by a star, supported by a crescent. The Harem presents a line of gables with numerous windows, closed by gilded lattice-work. The exterior of the palace is tastefully painted in white and gold, giving it a light and elegant appearance. The reception rooms are ornamented with much splendour, and the furniture is of the most magnificent and costly stamp ; combining Asiatic luxuries with the comforts of the West. Divans of embroidered velvet form a pleasing contrast to the handsome European -couch. Sevres porcelain, Persian carpets, and Italian marbles are observed, and various articles of Geneva workmanship and Roman gems. In the principal saloon there are six of the most magnificent pier glasses in the world, in gilt frames, surmounted with the arms of Turkey and of Russia, having been presented to Mahmoud by Nicholas shortly after the ratification of the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi.

He was acquainted with many of my Parisian friends, respecting whom he made inquiries, apparently from feelings of attachment and gratitude, and expressed great respect for the memory of General Rapp. Osman Pacha died of the plague a short time after my depar ture from Constantinople. Having touched upon the subject of this dreadful scourge, I wdl take the opportunity to observe that precautionary measures are now almost generaUy adopted by the Turks, but they are conducted with so little regularity and such want of system, that favour able results can hardly be expected. An instance of Turkish inconsistency, iu this respect, took place in regard to myself, for on entering the palace I was made to pass through the perfume chamber and undergo a thorough process of fumigation, and I was informed that an upholsterer, who had conveyed thither certain merchandise on the preceding evening, had been simi larly treated, whde the articles he brought were ad mitted and retained without the shghtest precaution. This is one specimen among many that could be ad duced of the imperfect manner in which the Turks follow our examples. The Sultan having deshed that I should be summoned to his presence, I ascended to his first floor, where the state apartments are situated, and after passing through three haUs, was ushered into a room on the right-hand, where I found his Highness sitting on a couch. I was placed opposite to him, in the midst of seven or eight of his chief Pachas, those of inferior rank remaining near the entrance. Having told the Sultan that I"], [170, "108 TURKEY. considered myself most fortunate in being admitted to an audience of a Prince whose great actions had so distinguished him in Europe, he replied, that he had heard me spoken of, and was glad to make my acquaint ance. The Seraskier then stated, that we were old friends, and, on my confirming this, I found he had pre viously spoken to the Sultan of our former good under standing. His Highness baring inquired my opinion of his troops, I felt that the question was embarrassing, but extricating myself with the best grace in my power, and avoiding in my reply either much departure from the truth, or any offensive observation, I hastened to pass some sincere and weU-merited eulogiums on the crew of the Admiral's ship. I added, that I should be much gratified in seeing the School of the Guards, which Namik Pacha had promised to shew me, and seized that opportunity to impress upon the Sultan the great importance of well-organized and well-conducted schools, and the influence they might exercise over the fate of his new army. He observed, that there were aheady other schools, and that he should establish stdl more. But here resolutions are not very lasting, nor is the same system long followed ; jealousies prevailing more in this than in any other country. In speaking of the School of the Guards, I unfortunately called it \" the School established by Namik Pacha,\" and I afterwards learnt that this expression had wounded the self-love of others, aroused envious feebngs, and given weapons to be used with Mahmoud against him. The Sultan adverted to the great number of years that had elapsed since my name had first been heard of in Europe ; I observed to him that I was indebted for this melancholy advantage to two causes, in the first place, to my being an old man; and secondly, to"], [171, "CONSTANTINOPLE. 109 my having in very early hfe emerged from the crowd, by a series of fortunate circumstances, so that when only twenty-four years of age, I had attained the rank of a General officer. Having invited me to inspect the cavalry regiment quartered at Coucoules, and to be present at the man\u0153uvres it would perform, the Grand Signor dismissed me in the kindest manner, saying that everything should be shewn to me that I deshed to see at Constantinople. In withdrawing, I was accompanied by persons of the highest rank, and in particular by Hahl-Pacha, the son-in-law of Mahmoud, who professed a great regard for me. After this audience, I walked through the gardens of the Palace, which are composed of elevated terraces, ornamented and embeUished by shrubs and basins, with jets-d'eau. But it is singular that those nearest to the Palace are arranged with less taste than the rest. On the 26th of July, I went to the Guards' school, which is situated at a short distance from the artillery barrack, and above the smaU gun manufactory. It contained 500 young persons, and appeared to me to be well organized. This institution was the object of Namik Pacha's continual care and daUy solicitude. Zeal and emulation were evinced by the pupils, chosen from amongst those individuals of the guards who displayed the greatest degree of inteUigence; that being regarded as the only title to admission. The Lancasterian system of instruction is adopted, from which remarkable results have been obtained; for, notwithstanding the difficulty of reading and writing the Turkish language, the students in the school of the Guards succeed in doing both with accuracy in the space of ten months, whereas, by the ordinary methods"], [172, "110 TURKEY. it would require six years of study to attain the same object. The branches of tuition are reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, geography, algebra, and the principles of military movements and duties. There are philosophical and astronomical instruments, but as yet there are not any professors. Should this school be supported and extended it may become highly use ful, and in fact, the foundation-stone of the Turkish army; but its duration is doubtful, as it may faU by the first intrigue, and its success although of much importance, would not alone suffice to infuse Ide and spirit into the Turkish Emphe. The entire regenera tion of the Government of the Provinces is also requisite, which appears to be impossible to those acquainted with the real state of things. On the 27th of July, we made the tour of the sea line. When Constantinople was a fortress, this was the weakest part of its defences, having points of easy access, and it surprises me that the Crusaders did not direct any attempt on this front. I observed that fine marble columns had been used as common materials, laid horizontaUy in the construc tion of the walls, thus placing under contribution the ornamental portions of the palaces, and other public buildings that had fallen into decay previously to the last catastrophe which deprived the Christians of this noble city. In returning, we passed the Fresh Waters of Europe, where we saw the boys' dance performed by persons of loose and abandoned character. This, though a com mon amusement of the East, is a spectacle much too disgusting for description.

Miss Pardoe's first visit to the mosque of St. Sophia was at midnight, and she thus glowingly describes it: \u2014 \" On passing the threshold, I found myself in a covered peristyle, whose gigantic columns of granite are partially sunk in the wall of which they form a part; the floor was covered with fine matting, and the coloured lamps, which hang in festoons from the lofty ceiling, shed a broad light on all the surrounding objects. As I looked around me, our attendant moved forward, and raising a curtain which veiled a double door of bronze, situated at mid-length of the peristyle, I involuntarily shrunk back before the blaze of hght that burst upon me. \" Far as the eye could reach upwards, circles of coloured fire, appear ing as if suspended in mid-air, designated the form of the stupendous dome ; while beneath, devices of every shape and colour were formed hy myriads of lamps of various hues : the imperial closet, situated opposite to the pulpit, was one blaze of refulgence, and its gilded lattices flashed back the brilliancy, till it looked hke a gigantic meteor ! \" As I stood a few paces within the doorway, I could not distinguish the limits of the edifice. I looked forward, upward \u2014 to the right hand, and to the left \u2014 but I could only take in a given space, covered with human beings, kneeling in regular lines, and at a certain signal bowing their turbaned heads to the earth, as if one soul and one impulse animated the whole congregation ; while the shrill chaunting of the choir pealed through the vast pile, and died away in lengthened cadences among the tall, dark pillars which support it. \" And this was St. Sophia ! To me it seemed like the creation of enchantment \u2014 the hght \u2014 the singing voices \u2014 the mysterious extent, which baffled the earnestness of my gaze\u2014 the ten thousand Moslems, all kneelin\u00b0* with their faces turned towards Mecca, and at intervals laying their foreheads to the earth \u2014 the bright and various colours of the dresses \u2014 and the rich and glowing tints of the carpets that veiled the marble floor \u2014 all conspired to form a scene of such unearthly mag nificence, that I felt as though there could be no reality in what I looked on, but that, at some sudden signal, the towering columns would"], [174, "112 TURKEY. a Christian church built by Justinian.

At page 383 of the same volume, the talented authoress thus describes her daylight visit to this celebrated place of Moslem worship : \u2014 \" At length we reached St. Sophia ; and I felt my heart beat quicker, as I once more traversed the flagged court, and passed the elegant fountain at which the faithful perform their ablutions ; with its project ing octagonal roof, its marble bashi, and its covering of close iron net work, to protect the spring from the pollution of the birds. \" At the entrance of the peristyle to which I have before alluded, we put on the slippers we had provided, and, as soon as we had all passed, the doors were closed. \" How different was the aspect of every object around me from that which it wore on my last visit ! Then, all was refulgent with hght ; and now a sacred gloom hung upon the dark walls, and floated hke a veil about our path. Few were they who did not pass on in silence ; for there is a power and a sublimity in scenes like the one I am attempt ing to describe, which overcome for a while even the most vul\u00b0*ar minds ; while to the susceptible and contemplative, the spell is deepened a thousand-fold. \" One burst, rather of sound than speech \u2014 the wordless tribute of irrepressible admiration \u2014 heralded our passage across the block of por phyry upon which close the interior doors of the mosque ; and in less than a moment the richly carpeted floor of marble, porphyry, jasper, and verd-antique, was Mosaiced with groups of gazers throughout its whole extent. Some stood riveted to the spot on which they had first halted as if touched by the wand of an enchanter, and scarcely stirrino* a limb in the excess of their absorbing contemplation ; others hurried rapidly along, as though breathless with eager and impatient curiosity But upon the whole the first view of St. Sophia disappointed me : I had carried away an idea of much greater extent ; spacious as it was, I could now see from one extremity of the wide edifice to the other I was no longer bewildered by the blaze of innumerable lights and I know not wherefore, but I regretted the mysterious indistinctness of outline which had thralled me during my midnight visit.\""], [175, "113 CONSTANTINOPLE. of the west of Europe, and bore in mind theh lofty Gothic forms, their great dimensions, and the holy feelings they inspire. But the most unfavourable con trast for the mosque of St. Sophia, is that stupendous edifice, the finest monument of art that man has ever reared, \u2014 the vast cathedral of St. Peter. The mosque of Saint Sophia is situated opposite to the Seraglio; its form is that of a simple rotunda inscribed within a square. As the sides of this mosque do not correspond with the cardinal points, and as Mahometans turn, when praying to the east, the line In Mr. Auldjo's work we find the following description : \u2014 *\u2022 St. Sophia was built by Justinian, on the ruins of a church of the same name, already twice destroyed ; and part of the dome was a third time overthrown by an earthquake. Splendid and various were the treasures it once contained ; but these have been long since removed by the desecration and sacrilege of the Latin and the Moslem ; and nothing of that description is now left to astonish the pilgrim of either creed, who approaches this sacred temple. Justinian gloried that he had erected a place of worship which far surpassed the work of Solomon ; and on dedicating it the second time, after the restoration of the dome, he was nearly maddened with joy. What would have been his feelings could he have foreseen the day when the conquering Latin should defile its altar, and the infidel Turk convert it into a temple for the worshippers of his prophet, after being consecrated to the pure religion of Christianity for a period of nine hundred years ! St. Sophia is thus equally an object of veneration to the Christian and the Mussulman. \" We proceeded into the interior of the edifice, with which I confess myself greatly disappointed; as the tout ensemble displays no magni ficence, and the impressions on the gazer's mind partake of none of that involuntary admiration and religious awe, which the sight of an old English cathedral, or the splendid churches of Italy, never fail to pro duce. One of its greatest defects arises from want of loftiness in the dome, the diameter of which is 115, while its height does not exceed 20 feet. There is an immense number of columns, the spoils of various heathen temples. Of these, eight, of porphyry, are from that dedicated to the sun by the Emperor Aurelian, and the same number, of green marble, verd-antique or Serpentine, from the temple of Ephesus.\" \u2014 Journal of a Visit to Constantinople, fye, by John Aukljo, Esq., F.G.S."], [176, "114 TURKEY. to indicate the position they should take is traced by a set of striped mats, placed in the required direction. Their arrangement is distressing to the eye, from being oblique to the hne that divides the mosque into two equal parts. We ascended to the summit of the dome, from whence we saw at one view the whole of the Seraglio. We afterwards repaired to the mosque of Sultan Achmet, an object of peculiar veneration to Mussul mans. It stands on the place of the Atmeidan, and is distinguished by having six minarets ; \u2014 a greater number than belongs to any other mosque in Constantinople. From thence we went to see that of Osmanieh, which is of elegant proportions, and beautifudy enriched by an internal facing of marble. We closed our tour by a visit to the mosque of Solymanieh. This is a spacious and handsome edifice, but it is in aU respects inferior to Saint Sophia. Its dome is supported by four pUlars, 25 feet in width ; they are 80 feet apart in one direction and 70 in the other.* * There are few matters of taste on which there has existed a greater difference of opinion than on the pre-eminence of the various mosques of Constantinople; some travellers awarding the palm to that of Saint Sophia, others to that of Sultan Achmet, and there are those who speak in higher praise of the Solymanieh, or the mosques of Mahomet and Osman. And yet there is no discrepancy in this, for each of these magnificent structures has its peculiar beauties, and the beholder receives the pleasing impression from one edifice, rather than from another, more in consequence of its relative harmony with his own feelings, than of its superior merits, but still each eulogist may give a reason for his preference. Thus the Solymanieh is famed for being the largest and most splendid of mosques ; that of Sultan Achmet for its site, its general elegance and beauty, and for the extreme delicacy of the arabesque workmanship with which it is adorned ; while Saint Sophia is admired and renowned for its solemn and imposing grandeur; for the size of its enormous dome ; and for its numerous columns."], [177, "115 CONSTANTINOPLE. In the middle of the eastern side of every mosque there is a kind of niche, towards whicli the congre gation turn to pray. On the left (that is to the north of the niche), is a large gaUery, enclosed by gilded lattice work, and arranged for the reception of the The following brief description of some of the prominent features of the most celebrated mosques, may not prove unacceptable to the reader. The number in Constantinople is very considerable, and thirteen are pre-eminently distinguished as Imperial mosques, from having been built by some of the Sultans, as acts of piety. Saint Sophia having been described in a former page, requires no further notice beyond an observation, that the very decided preference given to it by our author, is far from being a general impression. The Solymanieh was erected by Solyman II., surnamed the Magni ficent, and this noble edifice is worthy of its founder. It was commenced in the year 1550, and was completed in five years ; the more valuable part of the materials of the Christian church of Saint Euphonia, at Chalcedon, which was dilapidated for that purpose, being used in its construction. Its form is that of a quadrangle, 234 feet long and 227 wide, and it has a fine portico, consisting of six lofty and beautiful pillars of Egyptian porphyry, at the principal entrance, the ascent to which is by a flight of marble steps. The edifice is surmounted by a large dome supported by four pillars of Thebaic granite, nearly 60 feet in height, wliich are seen in the interior of the building; and it has four beautiful minarets, with galleries ornamented hy tracery. It is illuminated at night by innumerable lamps, hung around the dome, and from the ceihng of the aisles. There is something very imposing in the chaste simplicity, the vast extent, and the solemn gloom of this building. The mosque of Sultan Achmet, though less elegant in the details than the Solymanieh, is, in exterior effect, superior to it, as well as to St. Sophia. It was built early in the seventeenth century, by the Sultan whose name it bears, and who resolved that his mosque should surpass in beauty both Saint Sophia and the Solymanieh. Nothing could have been more suited to his object than the commanding site selected for this superb edifice, near the Atmeidan, one of the loftiest portions of the city ; for towering majestically above the Seraglio gardens, it forms the most conspicuous feature of the gorgeous scene presented to the stranger, who approaches from the sea of Marmora."], [178, "116 TURKEY. Grand Signor. To the right, are the stairs and seat of the Imanm, who delivers the religious lecture. Parallel to the eastern side, and at a trifling distance, there is a raised platform, supported by columns, from which one of the Ulema teaches and expounds the Koran. The Mosques have an exterior enclosure generally planted with trees, and decorated with a fountain, furnishing a never-ceasing supply of water for the It also appears to great advantage from the open space of the Atmeidan, for the outer court is surrounded by magnificent trees, probably coeval with the structure, and forming a pleasing contrast with the walls. Its beauty is increased by its six minarets, whose position was managed with great judgment, and the gilding of their slender spires and the lightness of the galleries, adorned by Saracenic workmanship, give them an elegance beyond tbe power of description. The Sultan is said to have taken so deep an interest in the progress of this mosque, that he devoted one hour of every Friday, after prayers, to manual labour on the building, in order to stimulate his fellow-work men to increased exertion; and, as a further encouragement, he is represented to have himself paid the wages of each individual employed. This edifice has no less than thirty cupolas, besides the principal dome, which is supported by four gigantic fluted columns. The walls are richly painted in fresco, and hght is admitted through windows of stained glass, which are so arranged as to give a pleasing and solemn effect to the interior of the building. The cloistered court is an object possessing great beauty, being sur rounded by graceful arabesque columns, whose capitals resemble clusters of stalactites. The court is paved with fine marble, and in the centre there is a handsome fountain, covered by a cupola, producing a feehng of refreshing coolness. The architect of this mosque was a Turk, and it cannot fail to cause surprise that an individual of that nation should produce a design rival ling the chefs- d'\u0153uvre of Grecian art. The interior bears some resem blance to the nave and transept of St. Paul's, and there is altogether about this building, a noble simplicity and grandeur befitting a place of worship. The author is incorrect in using the expressions, \"mosque of Soly manieh, and mosque of Osmanieh,\" for the word Solymanieh implies the mosque of Solyman, and Osmanieh, the mosque of Osman.

On the 30th, we went to see the turning Dervishes, whose ceremonies foreigners are aUowed to witness. We were admitted into a spacious hall, the circum ference of wliich formed a kind of gallery for spectators. The Dervishes having entered in procession, the chief commenced with a prayer: singing, with bad music, was heard from a gadeiy above that in which we had been placed, and to this accompaniment the Dervishes commenced turning themselves, gradually increasing the rapidity of their movements, until their ample robes extended almost horizontally from the waists of the wearers. This violent exercise was long continued, and did not cease untd all appeared exhausted by fatigue. There never was anything more calculated to provoke laughter than this senseless exhibition, though I must confess that I carried away a different impression to that of ridicule ; for this display of combined gravity and foUy, in men of respectable appearance, who believe that they are offering homage to the Deity, created in me a feeling of deep melancholy, and filled my breast with pity for so degraded a state of human nature. I left the hall in astonishment at the absurdities to which men are led by the extravagance of their imagination. The strong tendency of the mind to actions which overstep the bounds of reason, especially where religion is the cause of excitement, appears to be the best solution of the hrational creed of the turning Dervishes ; but it is very difficult to understand that these wretched beings, entitled at most to our pity, should be objects"], [180, "118 TURKEY. of public veneration. This feehng is much weakened at present, but it must have been very powerful, when signal honours and privileges were heaped upon this sect, some of which it still retains. When the Sultan mounts the throne, it is the Chief of the turning Dervishes who girds him with the sword of Othman; thus performing the most prominent part in the solemn ceremony of the inauguration of the Grand Signor. Before leaving Constantinople, I might touch upon the interior organization of the Empire, but information on this subject is to be found everywhere, since few travellers have omitted some mention of it. It is weU known that the Pachas exercise uncon troUed power in all the provinces, and that, subject only to their authority, the Mutzelims of the different districts perform the administrative functions. The Ulema, men who devote theh lives to the study of the Koran, and of the commentaries of the sheiks, cele brated for their sanctity and knowledge, are responsible for all matters relating to the administration of justice. This body is highly respected, both on account of the duties intrusted to it, and of the power of its chief, whose acts are sometimes paramount to those of the Sultan, and can even legalise his dethronement. But I wiU say one word regarding the supposed reforms of Mahmoud. Their fame has resounded throughout Europe, and it has been thought that the Sultan has created a new order of things, and com menced an era of civilization in Turkey, whereas in reality, little more has been effected than the destruc tion of the Janissaries, and the establishment of the new military force. The former was a useful and im portant act, for which the Sultan is deserving of the highest praise ; but the troops by which the Janissaries"], [181, "119 CONSTANTINOPLE. have been replaced, are far from realizing the hopes that were conceived of them; and as to the boasted reforms, they bear only on matters of a frivolous nature, such as the change of titles, or of dress. Thus the turban has been proscribed; the Reis-Effendi has changed his name to that of \" Minister for Foreign Affairs ;\" the power of the Grand Vizier has been cur tailed; the extent of some of the provinces altered; and the army is recruited by conscription, according to the arbitrary wiU of the Pachas. This measure is, therefore, carried into effect in the most injudicious and unjust manner, so that the men collected for the service of the state are of a description which cannot be recognized as belonging to that fine race of Turks we have been accustomed to admhe. A decree of the Sultan ordered, that to each Pacha an officer should be joined, who, while independent of the Pacha's power, should be charged with the collec tion of the imposts ; but, whether from a difficulty of finding persons calculated for the office, or from other causes, this order has never been carried into effect, and the cupidity and injustice of the Pachas and Mut zehms were never greater than at present. Turks as well as Christians neglect the cultivation of theh land, knowing that others wUl reap the fruits of theh labour, and in every dhection the population is diminishing. Some rebellious tyrants, it is true, have been put to death; \u2014 for instance, Ali Pacha, the oppressor of Joa nina, and his chUdren have faUen ; but anarchy reigns in their stead, and the Sultan is neither more powerful nor richer from the change. The great \" Timars \" or fiefs, which existed in Asia, and were wisely governed, furnished the emphe, in time of war, with twenty thousand good cavalry; but"], [182, "120 TURKEY. the Sultan has destroyed these fiefs, and as his agents cannot exercise over the population the same degree of authority that the original owners possessed, he neither receives troops nor money from these districts, which are a prey to disorder. Every thing, in short, exhibits weakness, and the elements of dissolution are spreading in all dhections. A remarkable change has taken place in the cha racter of the Turks, who, instead of the profound respect and veneration which they formerly entertained for the blood of Othman, feel a sentiment of estrange ment from the sovereign who frequently forgets the principles of the Koran ; imitates the customs of Chris tians, and attempts to force theh institutions on his people. The fanaticism of the Turks, once a powerful bond of union, has been calmed and subdued ; and as they have no privileged classes of society, or hereditary distinctions, the severing, or even loosening of the ties which they acknowledged, leaves to them only separate interests, without moral power, or real force. The Turk is guileless, honest, and truth-speaking, but ignorant, proud, and apathetic. These peculiarities have undergone no alteration for centuries, because there is scarcely any impulse capable of arousing him. The sensual enjoyments he derives from repose, from his pipe, or from the pleasures of the harem, and the regular performance of the prescribed prayers, con stitute his only occupation and excitement. His mind naturaUy of a low standard, would require the most powerful stimulants to bring him into action ; but such an existence as we have described, the insipidity of which causes both discouragement and disgust, must produce both a lethargic stupor and inanity, pervading the entire nation. The only important result of the"], [183, "CONSTANTINOPLE. 121 changes that have taken place is a softening of the national manners. Capital punishments are less fre quent than formerly, and they are generally preceded by an examination into facts, and by a formal sen tence. But in order to show more clearly the present state of the Ottoman Empire, we must examine in detail its component parts. The Mahometan population, of both sexes, and in cluding aU ages, does not at the very utmost exceed three mdlions and a half of persons, and is spread over an immense surface. On one side it is intermixed with a more numerous population of Christians, whose seeming submission is a veil to their really hostile feehngs; and, on the other, the Turks hold in sub jection an Arab population, who, having for a consi derable period feared and respected theh masters, have now a conviction of theh own superiority : \u2014 such is the Turkish Empire, and strange to say, an idea of power stdl attaches to its name. The actual number of the Turks has always been small in comparison with the population of the terri tories they have ruled. They have never possessed more than a factitious, uncertain, and unstable domi nion, and at no period has their power been weU organized or homogeneous. Anarchy, and disorders of every kind, have therefore daily undermined its foun dations. The Turks have never so cordially united with the Christians as to constitute one nation ; on the contrary, they have always remained an isolated people, reigning by tyranny and force over those whom they have vanquished, and in thus maintaining the attitude of conquerors, they have ever been regarded as a tran sitory power. G"], [184, "122 TURKEY. History furnishes examples of conquests simUar to those achieved by the Turks, but with opposite results, because the conduct of other victors has been different. When the Franks, who at first were merely a tribe, became masters of Gaul, they were converted to the Christian faith, and by thus embracing the religion of the conquered, were blended with them. Feudahsm having then organized society and combined its various interests, the Franks became the head and centre of a new people. When the Tartars subjugated China, their conduct was simUar, and they incorporated themselves with the natives, by adopting their customs and religion. These wise examples have been disregarded by the Turks, who, refusing to admit the people living under their yoke, to any participation in their greatness, have always treated them as enemies ; and notwithstanding theh numerical inferiority, they have never ceased to press upon the vanquished with all the weight of an unbridled and capricious tyranny. As the victors have never admitted any hereditary distinctions amongst themselves, an absolute equality prevails, founded on theh institutions and customs ; and this equality, being pushed to the utmost hmits, is far from giving power or stability. Even the family, the very foundation of social order, does not exist in Turkey, for the plurality of wives, and the purchase of slaves \u2014 a species of adoption, \u2014 change its very nature, and stamp it with a totaUy different character from that which it bears amongst the more civdized nations of Europe. The Turks, whose continual exactions from the Christians increased their riches and gratified their pride, were formerly united by motives of common"], [185, "123 CONSTANTINOPLE. interest ; but deprived, as they have lately been, of aU immunities, and of that special protection of theh government which had enabled them to oppress the other inhabitants of the Ottoman dominions, the con necting link that bound the Mussulmans together has been severed ; and thus weakened, they are doomed to share the lot of aU the other subjects of the Sultan, whUe they stUl must bear exclusively the burthens which theh creed imposes on them. Hence we may reasonably ask, by what circumstance or process, the Turkish Empire can be reconstructed or restored? The base on which it was founded has disappeared, and we cannot expect that the Christians, who form the population of European Turkey, wiU take part in the combinations required to regenerate this country, and thus prolong their own state of bondage. In the days of theh triumphs and splendour, the Turks might have effected the desired amalgamation, and brought about a fusion of interests that has now become impossible : for these two distinct races of people are not only divided, but inimical, the less numerous confining the other by a feeble chain. In Asia the population includes a large body of Arabs, who constitute the greater proportion of the inhabitants, and profess the Mahometan religion. The delusion that had long prevaded as to the power of the Turks, and which formed their chief protection, having vanished, the Arabs have acquired not merely a knowledge of their own power, but a consciousness of superiority ; they have therefore attempted their enfran chisement, and are rapidly advancing towards a degree of perfection in theh social system. The movement that commenced in Egypt and Syna has produced in those countries wealth and other important resources, G 2"], [186, "124 TURKEY. which are likely to weaken still further the power of the Turkish monarch, who would gladly overturn the systematic order of things estabbshed in opposition to his will. Thus is Mahmoud encompassed by difficulties, appa rently insurmountable, for on what can he rest for sup port? or where cohect the requisite materials for the work he wishes to attempt ? When Peter the Great undertook to civilize the Rus sians, he found them a homogeneous mass, to whose interests, sentiments, opinions, and genius he could easily appeal. Placed at a distance from the scene of the great events passing in Europe, and taking part in those only that conduced to his ends, he had time to devote to the organization and improvement of his empire. But in Turkey, where the bonds of society are weak, and the people divided and at variance, it seems impos sible to combine and press them forward to a common object ; especiaUy in the Sultan's present position, threatened as he is by a coUision of contending interests, that might occasion a general crisis. The creation of the Ottoman Empire, and its power, resulted from the devastating anarchy existing among the nations in the midst of whom the Osmanlies were placed, and who were therefore unable to oppose any effectual resistance to them. But their success did not produce order; confusion continued to prevail, the authority of the conquerors being alone supported by a war, which was prosperous for a length of time \u2014 the circumstances remaining unchanged that had caused the early triumphs of this people. Yet, even then, the Turks were not in them selves formidable, for theh number was smaU, and it"], [187, "CONSTANTINOPLE. 125 was only by capturing Christian chUdren and educating them in Islamism, that their armies were recruited. It is not difficult to understand the continuance of this state of thing during a period of contention and excitement ; but it might have been foreseen that this empire contained germs, which at a time of tranquil lity, would produce its dissolution. That this has not aheady taken place can only be ascribed to the weak ness and division of its neighbours, and to the jealousies subsisting among the Christian powers, which insured to the Porte a protecting intervention, after its reverses. Times, however, are much changed ; the circumstances that gave birth to the Ottoman Empire, cannot again occur; and were Solyman the Great to re-appear on earth, even he would not be considered a formidable Prince. An administration calculated to create and husband resources does not exist in Turkey, and is no longer suited to her.* The elements required are absolutely wanting : these are, a mass of enUghtened individuals, with enlarged and steady views, and unwavering reso lutions; but this country probably contains not one such being. Everything would require to be remo delled at the same moment, for aU is under the influence of ignorance and corruption ; and whatever Mahmoud may desire in this respect, he is not fated to attain his object, of which he has but a vague and undefined con ception. The weakness of his power and the misery of his people must therefore increase, and the internal disorders that wiU arise on the first unexpected out break, wiU cause the destruction of a state whose real * This appears an extraordinary statement, for it would be difficult to understand how such an administration as the author alludes to, could he unsuited to the state of any country.

All the requisites for organization of which Turkey is defi cient, have suddenly sprung up in Egypt, and are earnestly and unremittingly employed towards the attainment of the desired object. Mehemet Ah is accused of being covetous, and of exposing the people to be plundered by his officers ; but by no other course than that adopted could he procure the funds required for his operations. I speak neither of the justice nor philanthropy of the question, but of its policy. The Viceroy has already made great progress in his under taking, by establishing a system of obedience, and a perfect police, in the extensive country under his con trol. He is respected rather than feared, and such is the opinion entertained of him, that opposition to his will never enters the mind even of those who were previously the most inchned to independence or re bellion. This is the foundation of regular order; for the first step toward civilization is to produce sub mission. The second important act of Mehemet Ali was the change he originated in the agriculture of Egypt, by * Recent events have shown how completely Marshal Marmont mis calculated both the military resources of Turkey and the independent and noble spirit of its rulers, as well as the courage of the Mahometan portion of the subjects of the Sultan, and as he probably formed his opinion on that of the Russian Emperor, we can imagine how long the latter Sovereign has entertained views of aggression by the downfall of Turkey, which he has laboured so insidiously to produce.

If suc cess continue to attend his various improvements, and if the works the Viceroy has commenced answer his expectations, there will be a further increase of revenue, although even now, this country produces seven times the amount it yielded to the French troops at the period of its occupation by them. Manufactures, suited to the natural circumstances of Egypt, have been established, and are prospering ; they suffice for the necessities of the Government and the wants of th^. people, and compete with those of other nations in the European markets.* Those who take a contracted view of the present position of this country, might be led to conclude that the Pacha alone profited by these riches, because the bulk of the inhabitants are not supposed to derive any immediate or tangible benefit from them \u2022 but it should be remembered, that the Arabs are desirous of rising in the scale of nations, by becoming independent of Turkey; and that as the wealth acquired by their ruler, and applied to promote his pohtical power, is in furtherance of this object, the people are so far positive participators in the improved condition of the state. When the necessities of Mehemet Ali shall have been satisfied \u2014 when his extensive works of improvement shaU have ceased to require the immense expenditure they now demand \u2014 when articles of commerce shall * It is to he regretted that the author has not here given some state ment of the nature and amount of these manufactures.

Mehemet Ali has accom plished another great object in establishing an efficient military force. He now possesses an army, the forma tion of which presented extraordinary difficulties, for the extreme repugnance of the natives of the East to a regular military service, and theh prejudices on this head, are well known ; yet he has overcome aU these obstacles by acting discreetly, and by adopting such preliminary measures as were calculated to insure suc cess. Satisfactory results have been aheady obtained, and he is following a course that must lead to theh extension and improvement. Officers are instructed, in the various schools, for all branches of his service ; and the confidence he reposes in a clever man, who is the foundation-stone of the edifice he is rearing, is a guarantee that, in a very few years, his army will bear a favourable comparison with those of Europe.* The means at Mehemet Ali's disposal, for the establishment of his naval force, were limited, and the materials of which it was composed, as weU as the national circum stances at the time of its formation, were unfavourable to its success; nevertheless it is as formidable as the exigencies of his situation require, and being well appointed and efficient, it holds out a promise of per forming valuable services. The basis of a durable power has thus been effec tually laid, since this government has not only suffi cient \u2022 internal force and energy to establish and main- * The person alluded to is M.

In the accom plishment of this great work, Mehemet Ali has had the assistance of a compact and homogeneous population, full of inteUigence, remarkable for its self-respect, strongly predisposed to enthusiasm, and laborious, sober, contented, and obedient. In short, the people are ready to promote the interest of theh country, and susceptible of any form or impression that they may be required to take. The condition of the Christian popu lation of Syria is favourable to the advance and stabi lity of the new power, being assembled in the same district, weU disciplined, sufficiently numerous to be useful but not to dream of independence, and so much in dread of Turkish tyranny as to be willing to draw tighter the bonds which connect it with the Govern ment of Egypt. By attention to the interests of this people, it may be incorporated with the Arab state, and add materially to its strength. Having thus given a picture of what I consider to be the future destiny of the work of Mehemet Ah, I must, on the other hand, observe that if the power he is raising in Egypt and Syria be overturned, and suc ceeded by the direct authority of the Sultan, the imme diate consequence must be the surrender of these provinces to the miseries of poverty and rapine, by arresting the progress of civilization, causing the aban donment of the recent improvements, and renewing anarchy and confusion. Hence no accession of strength would result to Turkey; for whatever may be the resources of a country, they can but little avail its G 3"], [192, "130 TURKEY.

In a word, either the new state wiU become consoli dated, and in that event hostile to the Sultan, who we may suppose, desires its destruction ; or it wUl faU to pieces, and its sources of wealth and power wiU dry up, and be equally lost to both. Thus the southern pro vinces cannot contribute to the re-estabhshment of the Ottoman Empire, and we have seen that its European possessions no longer promise support. In truth, then, it is confined to Constantinople, and the provinces immediately around the city, where the great propor tion of the Turkish population is assembled.* * On a careful examination of the comparison drawn by the author between the condition of Turkey and that of Egypt, we cannot avoid observing his strong bias in favour of the latter ; and it would have been more satisfactory, if, in describing the various efforts of the Sultan and his Viceroy to improve those countries, he had assigned reasons for the disappointment that each may have experienced ; for although none are stated to have occurred in Egypt, we can hardly imagine that, at the period even of the Marshal's visit, Mehemet Ali had not received some check to his exertions. But it is not improbable that, direct from the scenes of ruin and decay, which Asia Minor had presented to the author's view, the symptoms of fresh Use which Mehemet AU appeared to be infusing into his subjects, and their activity and occupation, may have created the impression that has produced the brilliant picture drawn bv the Marshal of all he saw, and that were he now to revisit Egypt he would discover that the bright illusion had already vanished. Whether that country may be firmly re-annexed to Turkey, and form again an integral part of the Ottoman Empire, yielding obedience to the Sidtan, or whether it may become independent, its progress towards civilization and prosperity must create a deep interest in the maritime and commercial nations of Europe. That Mehemet AU has made con siderable improvements in Egypt, is anxious to promote her interests, and to render her formidable, and that he possesses all the energ^ required for such a work, we do not deny, though we think a doubt may"], [193, "CONSTANTINOPLE. 131 This position being demonstrated, it may be asked if such a state can be independent, or deserve to be regarded as a power ? As the reply must obviously be in the negative, we are led to consider the consequences fairly be expressed of his capacity to aeeompUsh the Herculean task he has undertaken. The Marshal has severely criticised the course adopted by the Sultan in the formation of his army ; and there may be justice in his censure, for it was unwise, with means so inefficient, to enter on a work of such importance. But this ground of criticism also applies to Mehemet Ali ; for although by a different process from that of Mahmoud he may have succeeded better in the formation of his mUitary force, yet he has faUen into a similar error, by undertaking more than he was able to effect ; and hence some of the boasted improvements are languishing, and the conditions, on the fulfilment of which the author expects that the people wiU become more prosperous and happy, are such as cannot be realized for many years. The Viceroy's means were inadequate to accomplish what he desired, being deficient both in men and money; and his exactions from the people have caused their present wretchedness, without the cheering certainty of future benefit. The fertility of the country, with its active population properly directed, and reheved from oppressive imposts, might with rapidity produce enormous wealth, the careful application of which would con tribute to the happiness of the people, while tending to give stability to the state; and were Mehemet Ah acting as a faithful vassal of the Porte, this might be effected ; but struggling for independence, and to enrich and aggrandize himself, he has been led away by a double object beyond his reach. The development of the natural resources of the country ought to have been the first object of his care, and the increased revenue that must have resulted, would have enabled him to accomplish his plans for augmenting the strength and importance of his government ; but an opposite course of proceeding, which perhaps his usurpation may have forced upon him, has led him to compel the \"FeUahs\" to adopt an overstrained system of culture, and this, if recent reports be true, has not realized his expectations : the consequent want of funds to complete his pubUc works drove him into an aggressive policy that has been checked by the interference of some of the great powers of Europe. The essential difference between the Sultan and his Viceroy is, that the latter acted wisely by intrusting real power to the intelligent"], [194, "132 TURKEY. likely to result, and naturaUy arrive at the conclusion, that the Grand Signor can only exist under the protec tion of others ; and that it is imperative he should attach himself, decidedly and closely, to one of the two systems which now divide Europe. The fate of his empire will depend on the master he may choose. On the one hand there is Russia; on the other the maritime powers, to which Austria may be added, and these I name the \" Alliance of the West of Europe.\" Theh interests are opposed, and have hitherto been irreconcilable. To render this matter clear, it is necessary to examine on what basis the rights and pretensions of the parties are founded, and what are the causes that give to one of them the ascendency, and it is further of importance to discover, which, with the least danger to the Porte, can afford her the best protection ; or in other words, whose guardianship the Sultan would find the least foreigners who entered his service, and hence the success in organizing his naval and military forces ; but the Sultan had to deal with a more powerful and resolute people, and a turbulent priesthood, opposed to the extensive employment of Christians in offices of trust and importance and therefore he has been unable, or perhaps he has not found it politic, to adopt the same energetic step. That he feels the inclination to employ the fittest persons in his service without reference to creed, may be gathered from the fact of the fostering care bestowed on the institu tions of the httle island of Samos, of which he has intrusted the govern ment to a Christian prince, a Bulgarian by birth. The author seems hardly borne ou\u00a3in stating that the Sultan is the enemy of Egypt. That he detests the man who deprived him of his finest provinces may be admitted ; but the Sultan would belie all his efforts to regenerate the northern part of his Empire, if he faUed to carry on the improvements commenced by Mehemet Ali, should Egypt again be obedient to his wiU ; and if such a change should take place, backed as she would be by the resources of Turkey, her prosperity would rise to a level wliich it never can attain with the crippled resources of the Viceroy. (_\".\u2014 1839.)"], [195, "133 CONSTANTINOPLE. oppressive. When these questions are solved, there can no longer be a doubt as to the course his Highness ought to take. The difference to the Porte, between the protection of Russia and that of the three Powers, termed the \" Alliance,\" is, that the former possesses naturally an ascendency and command in Constantinople, which are sufficient during the continuance of peace, or till a revolution shall overturn the existing order of things in that city ; and the Sultan is aware that, should fresh circumstances place him in a condition to require an auxiliary military or naval force in his capital, Russia can rapidly supply it, without the possibility of hinderance. On the other hand, the protection of the Alliance could only be effectual by its uninter rupted occupation of Constantinople, for ff discon tinued, the Russians might prevent its renewal. At Sebastopol, one of the finest harbours in the world, Russia has twelve sad of the hne, perfectly armed, equipped, and ready for sea. In the immediate neighbourhood a division of the army is cantoned; it could embark in two days, and in three more reach Constantinople, the distance between Sebastopol and the Bosphorus being only 180 miles, and a .speedy passage almost a matter of certainty, owing to the prevalence of northerly winds, and the constant current from the Euxine towards the sea of Marmora. Thus, on the breaking out of disturbances at Constantinople, or the apprehension of interference from the allied fleet, that of Russia would pass the Bosphorus, with 12,000 troops on board, and take up such a position as circumstances might dictate ; whilst an army of 60,000 men would cross the Danube, pass the Balkan, and place itself at Adrianople; \u2014 these movements"], [196, "134 TURKEY. being effected with so much promptitude and facUity, that in Paris and London the intimation of the depar ture of the armament, and of its arrival on the scene of action, would probably be received together; the operations being of such a nature, that no circumstance whatever could prevent their being carried into execution. If, on the other hand, we suppose that the Alliance is to be put in motion, we must bear in mind the time required to prepare its means and accomplish its designs, taking into consideration that the distance of our ports from the Turkish dominions would of itself occasion a long passage, even if the wind and current were favourable, instead of the latter being invariably, and the former generaUy, opposed to a rapid voyage towards the East : and we must come to the conclusion that the announcement of the in tended expedition would reach Russia before the sailing of the fleet, and that therefore a surprise would be impossible; for even should the Russians not learn so speeddy as we have supposed, the hostde views upon Constantinople, still they would have ample time to counteract the projects formed against themselves. Under the most favourable circumstances that the hypothesis permits, the supposed arrangement could present but shght prospects of success, and must be utterly impracticable without the concurrence of the Sultan. We may therefore conclude it wiU never be attempted, as it cannot be imagined he would voluntarily entangle himself in difficulties, that must inevitably deprive him of the little power he retains, which in real dignity and consequence does not exceed the government of a city.* * It must he admitted, that in the present state of things no effectual hinderance could be offered to Russia, were she desirous of transporting"], [197, "135 CONSTANTINOPLE. Indeed if an aUied fleet were to appear suddenly before Constantinople, carrying troops for the occupa tion of the forts on the shores of the Dardanelles her forces from Sebastopol to the Bosphorus, for it is understood, that at this moment there is not in the Black Sea a single ship of war that does not bear her flag. \u2014 One of the fruits of the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi ! But should the Sultan take, as we contend, a wiser line of policy than that which he has lately followed, and attach himself to England, a simple remedy could be apphed to check the aggression of his northern neighbour. First, he should strengthen the defences of the Bosphorus, which can be made impregnable : Secondly, his fleet should cruize in the Black Sea, instead of lying uselessly at anchor near the capital, or making summer excursions to the \u00c6gean Sea : And thirdly, it should be joined by an English squadron, when the honour of our country might permit, or the Sultan's safety might require such aid. Indeed it is beheved that the moral effect of a single English man-of-war in the Euxine would restore the confidence of Turkey. Then the boasted facihty of invading the heart of the Otto man Empire would be no more thought of, and the necessity would cease for a permanent occupation of its capital by the troops of the Alliance. The question seems to be, at what period the supplementary article of the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi can be set aside. Neither in honour nor in pohcy can Turkey venture on that step, until there is positive evi dence of Russia entertaining hostile designs against her : \u2014 and it would be equivalent to a declaration of war against the Northern Empire, were England to infringe its stipulations. It is then an affair of time, and should the period elapse for which the said treaty is binding on the contracting parties, without an infraction of its terms, then aU the sagacity and skill of British diplomatists should be employed to prevent its extension or renewal. Nicholas is reported to have said that the DardaneUes are the gates of his house \u2014 so may the Bosphorus be termed of ours, and therefore the renewal of the treaty would be as much a hostile measure against our Empire, as the immediate appearance of a British squadron in the Black Sea would be a defiance to the Czar.

This was the only course by which the Sultan could retain even a shadow of sovereignty, and it seemed the more rational proceeding from its being in harmony with the necessities of Russia.* add that recent events have proved incontestibly that no effort should be spared to render the forts on the Bosphorus so powerful that no hostile fleet should be able to force that passage, unless indeed the arms of the allies should succeed to such an extent that terms may be imposed on Russia which would render it impossible for her ever to regain the maritime superiority of the Black Sea. Unless one of these alternatives be taken by the aUies, Constantinople wiU never be secure. (T.) * An English fleet in the Black Sea, or even a small squadron acting in conjunction with that of Turkey, and the improvement of the defences of the Bosphorus, as proposed in the note to page 135, would put a naval attack of Constantinople, by the Russians, utterly out of the question, and probably render hopeless an invasion from the princi palities ; for by preventing the army employed in that operation from receiving suppUes hy sea, it would be rendered dependent on the resources of the country it would occupy or traverse in its march, winch is not sufficiently productive to maintain a force of the magnitude necessary to afford a prospect of success. Adding to this impediment, the effect Ukely to be produced by an Austrian army acting on the right flank of the Russians, there wiU appear ample grounds for concluding that it is by no means a matter of certainty that Turkey must be the inevitable \" victim\" of the contest, as the author has asserted."], [199, "137 CONSTANTINOPLE. The Emperor of Russia is too sensible not to deshe the continuance of the present state of things in Con stantinople; and, I am convinced he prefers it to the actual possession of the city. What is his aim ? To have the free use of an indispensable maritime outlet, and he would rather owe this benefit to his influence than to direct authority ; since he thus possesses the advantages he legitimately covets, without the incon veniences that an occupation would entad. He avoids creating alarm in Europe by his ambition; evinces a respect for recognized rights; maintains the existing order of things : is a faithful ally, and yet attains the end he has in view. In the next page he states, that the object of Russia is simply to secure a free egress from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean ; but if that were all she required, where was the necessity for the secret article of the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, excluding the navies of other powers from the DardaneUes ? The drift of that article was, if possible, to deprive Turkey of the chance of assistance from England or France, against the encroachments of the Czar, and it is to be lamented that the author did not allow his comprehensive mind to take a wider range, in examining the aggressive conduct of the colossal power of the North, before he gave the weight of his opinion, as to its pacific and commercial views. (T.\u2014 1839.) The above note was written for the first edition in 1839, and that which follows is appUcable to recent events. Marshal Marmont speaks of the \" necessities of Russia.\" One might well be at a loss to comprehend what are the real neces sities of Russia. She has, one would suppose, ample territorial extent to satisfy the most grasping ambition, enough for good and safe government, sufficient for the happiness of her people \u2014 but not enough to give to her Emperor the power of dictating to every other nation in Europe, which is the object in all his tortuous course, and the basis of aU his subtle pohcy.

The premature possession of Constantinople would iu fact injure the internal prosperity of southern Russia, by arresting the spread of its wealth, and draining its capital and inhabitants into Turkey, by which the former power, so susceptible of great improvement, and so fit to receive a numerous population, would be con demned to remain a perpetual desert. A sovereign whose empire comprises a surface equal to the seventh part of all the continents of the globe has no need of its extension ; nor, having under his sceptre sixty mfl lions of people, has he reason for desiring to increase their number. It is not, therefore, new provinces or additional subjects that the Emperor of Russia seeks to acquire, but freedom of navigation, an advantage that an empire having extensive coasts cannot forego; for every facihty of commerce should be seized where popu lation is rapidly increasing, and activity and industry are extending the sphere of agriculture ; nor should a monarch, having a formidable maritime force, willingly consent to its imprisonment within the narrow limits of an inland sea, to be deprived of intercourse with the other oceans of the globe, or participation in the general benefits which providence has bestowed in common on the human race. He cannot dispense with the advan tages of universal competition ; and having the means he should not hesitate to use them in bursting the gates that are attempted to be closed against him. In the presemt instance the Czar is in possession of this power, for the very day on which the passage is refused to his fleet, he wiU seize and hold it in his own name, interests ? It is against Russia alone that Turkey needs protection, and even before the late attempts of the Czar to coerce the Sultan, it was but too obvious that the destruction of the Turkish power in Europe was tho dearest object to the heart of Nicholas.

[T.]) From these considerations it wdl be admitted, that it is the true policy of the Sultan to conciliate the Czar, who might so easily dethrone him, had he an advantage in adopting such a course (which I contend is not the case) ; and it is obviously the interest of the Sultan above aU things, to avoid hostUity against Russia, be cause the issue of the struggle would be his instant and irrevocable ruin, or would compel him to rush into the arms of other powers, whose protection would be less efficacious, and who would rob him of even the httle liberty he now enjoys. If the straits of the Bosphorus and HeUespont were a league or two in width, it is most probable that few persons in Russia would think of the conquest of Con stantinople ; but these passages are so narrow, that they may be regarded as the floodgates of a sea, arresting, at the mere caprice of another power, the fortunes of a mighty empire, and keeping in captivity her fleets. This would be insupportable, and there is no effort that a monarch should neglect to free himself from such dependence. I have demonstrated that the Russians may with the greatest facility repah to Constantinople, and I have also proved that they would take that step, not only with the consent, but actuaUy by the invitation of the Sultan ; I shall now shew that after such occupation, if pohtical combinations should not lead to the voluntary evacuation of the Turkish territory, the most intimate alliance between France, England, and Austria, and the most energetic efforts of these three powers, would be"], [202, "140 TURKEY. unable to force the Russians to retire from their posi tion on the Dardanelles. I wUl proceed to state the grounds of this assertion, previously explaining the probable operations of the Russian army. The force to be employed in the occu pation alluded to, would amount to about 60,000 men, consisting of a division of the army, united to the troops from the Krimea. The following arrangements appear to me well suited to carry into effect the objects of the Emperor : \u2014 To station 10,000 men at the Darda nelles, in a fortress of five or six bastions, to be con structed there, with two auxdiary forts, one at the extremity of the table land caUed \" Maltepe,\" and the other on the height commanding the batteries of Nagara : \u2014 To place three forts on the European coast, in the form of an amphitheatre, for the protection of its batteries from any enterprise on the land side ; encamp ing 10,000 men on the heights of Constantinople, to assist the ships of war anchored in the harbour in keep ing the city in subjection : \u2014 To post the remaining 40,000 men at Adrianople, and to form an extensive entrenched camp, with a system of towers, in the style of the works of defence at Lintz, embracing the Maritza and the river which there faUs into it. The construc tion of eighteen or twenty towers might render this position impregnable ; the force occupying it, consisting of between 30,000 and 40,000 men, could not be shut up within the entrenchment, and it would therefore keep in check an army of double its number, which would not with safety advance, leaving this force in its rear. To complete the system, 80,000 Russians should be assembled in Moldavia and Walachia, having their ad vanced guard on the banks of the Danube, ready to pass"], [203, "141 CONSTANTINOPLE. that river; the Russian grand army being collected between Warsaw and Cracow, waiting to cross the Vistula. With such a plan of operations, the aUies could not oblige the Russians to evacuate Constantinople ; neither could a French and English army be sent to disembark at the Dardanelles, with any prospect of success, in consequence of the extensive preparations required, and the immense expense of the undertaking. However great might be the efforts and the sacrifice of money, stiU the number of troops that could be employed on such an expedition is very limited ; the maximum may be estimated at 30,000 or 40,000 men, and even these coidd not be organized and equipped in a complete manner; for theh cavahy must of necessity be very weak, on account of the difficulty of transporting a large number of horses in so long a voyage ; and their artiUery would be equaUy inefficient, consisting of field guns, which are by no means suited to war on a great scale. This armament would proceed but slowly, and its departure being known, the Russians would be pre pared for its reception, so that on landing it would have to attack an army in position, provided with everything requisite for its operations, and capable of being aug mented to any extent that might be necessary. It would therefore be madness to undertake such an enter prise, and as we cannot see that it offers any reasonable hope of success, it is fair to presume that it wdl never be attempted. Hence we may conclude that France and England would employ their fleets only; and the numerical inferiority of the Russian squadron being admitted, we are prepared to allow that it must remain at anchor under the forts of the Dardanelles : where, secure from"], [204, "142 TURKEY. attack, it would be in a posture to threaten the com bined fleet, from possessing the facility of sailing into the Mediterranean, when circumstances might render such a movement desirable. The aUies would therefore be obliged to maintain, at a distance from home, and at a considerable cost, a very numerous fleet, without the hope of reaping any greater advantage from it than that of blockading their enemy.* The Austrians alone would therefore have to under take the land operations ; but how couid this be done with safety ? Their troops would enter Servia, pass the Balkan, and find on the southern side the en trenched camp of Adrianople, in a position to check their offensive operations ; and whilst man\u0153uvring, the Russian army of Walachia would pass the Danube, take them in reverse, and constrain them to retire. WiU it be said in reply that a second Austrian army might assemble in Transylvania, and oppose the offensive march of the Russian army of Walachia, either by a direct attack, or by operating on its flank or rear ? The mass of the Russian force assembled on the banks of the Vistula, would be enabled by its advanced position, to compel the greater part of the Austrian troops to remain in its presence, in order to cover the heart of the monarchy and even the capital, thus preventing the Austrian commander from detaching any important part of his strength ; so that the mere placing of the Russians as I have stated, might neutralise the offensive operations of their opponents and suspend their movements ; and con- * In a former page, the author has attempted to prove that the only object of Russia is to secure the freedom of navigation ; and as he here admits that the ships of that power would have to seek shelter in tha DardaneUes, on the appearance of the combined fleet, we may contend, that, according to his own showing, the efforts of the Allies would be crowned with success, by the mere employment of their naval force.

I have to observe that, if requisite, the Russian army in Poland might be weakened with out much inconvenience, since the capitals of Russia are too distant from the field of contention to create any apprehension for their safety, and this corps not being required to protect them, might always be con sidered on the offensive ; for supposing the enemy in its front to be more numerous, it could rethe in a menacing attitude, ready to retrace its steps, and enter Austria, whenever the events of the war might present the possibdity of such a movement. I do not seek to disguise the fact, that in represent ing the mUitary advantages to be in favour of the Rus sians, it is under the supposition that they are first the occupiers of Turkey, and I admit that if this were not the case these advantages would in a great degree dis appear. For if a French and English fleet were to pass the straits of the Dardanelles, and arrive at Constanti nople ; and if, at the same time, a corps of 50,000 men of the AUiance, Austrian or French, were to take up the position of Adrianople, and establish the entrenched camp of which I have spoken, then the Russians would * The Marquess of Londonderry, in his work on Russia, disputes this opinion of the Marshal, and the argument on which it is based (see chapter on pohtical relations.)

From that moment their fleet must return to the port of Sebastopol \u2014 not again to quit it, and if they moved an army towards the Balkan, it would be exposed to great danger from the operations of an Austrian force, debouching either from Transyl vania and entering Bessarabia, or from Hungary and marching into Servia, to take in reverse the army of Bulgaria. It is true that, in this case, the offensive movement of the Russians would be preceded by the entrance of a grand army into Transylvania, to cover the corps marching on Constantinople. Therefore this operation of the Russians, although difficult, is practi cable, whUst the other combination may be regarded as an absolute impossibility, on account of the proximity of Vienna; unless there were opposed to Russia, in addition to the fleets of France and England and the Austrian military force, a numerous French corps,* and perhaps also a Prussian army, which last would un doubtedly have great influence on the question. But the configuration of Prussia requires her to be cir cumspect, and the natural bias of her policy is to adopt a course adverse to the objects of the AUiance. There is another important consideration to add to the account in favour of Russia, viz. that in order to admit of the fleets and armies of the Alliance acting simultaneously, there must be a perfect harmony of arrangement between the three Powers; whereas their rival having at command both ships and troops, and his will being alone requisite to put them in motion, * As it is presumed France would be a wUling member of the AUiance, there cannot be a doubt of an army of that nation taking the field against Russia, and assisting, not merely in the defence of the Austrian dominions, but also in keeping Prussia in check if requisite.

A not less weighty consideration than those already touched upon is, that, in this military question, priority is of immense value, because possession must almost decide the issue. Everything, in short, is favourable to Russia, and the advantages she possesses may be summed up in few words \u2014 Her proximity to Turkey \u2014 The winds and currents being such as to facilitate the passage of her armament \u2014 And lastly, the policy of the Sultan.* The Czar's competitors have none of these advantages.

Should this necessity ever present itself, it would be imprudent to entertain the thought of fighting her in a position where aU the natural chcumstances are ranged on her side. Instead of attempting so unwise a proceeding, the means should be found, in political combinations, of accommodating at the same time the interests of Russia, and those of the rest of Europe, securing to the former the freedom of navigation she requires. Able politicians should beforehand seek the solution of this problem ; I wiU not here undertake it, for this great question would lead me too far from my purpose. Very important events occurred four years ago at Constantinople; I mean the arrival of the Russian troops, who saved the throne of the Grand Signor; their brief sojourn, and theh departure on the very day when they ceased to be requhed. It is difficult to estimate the effect these occurrences produced on pubhc opinion, but it has accustomed the Turks to the presence of the Russians.

The Sultan caUed that power to his aid, and it came without delay.* From that moment danger ceased, and so soon as the crisis had passed, the Russian fleet and army returned to the Krimea, with out requiring any sacrifice from the Sultan as a recom pense for the service rendered to him. This was an able stroke of pohcy, and has aheady been foUowed by important results; producing confidence; demonstrating the promptness and efficacy of the succours afforded, as weU as theh disinterestedness ; and giving the Sultan a conviction of his personal safety, which the general instability of things at Constantinople is not calculated to inspire in those who reign. Religious prejudices are wearing out; the fierce hatred of the Turks is dying away, and such protection as has already been received, is doubtless regarded by the Sultan as a right, of which he wiU avaU himself whenever he may be in peril. Both parties wiU fulfil the engagements they have reciprocally entered into, as they wiU find theh interest in such a course. I wdl add, that of aU the dangers that threaten the power of the Sultan, the most imminent, in my opinion, is a revolution arising from the discontent of his subjects, which might break out on any fortuitous occasion. In tbe first rank of such causes, I would place pecuniary embarrasment, a disaster that might occur at any moment. Delay in the payment of the new troops woidd throw everything into disorder, for although they are impotent for the defence of the throne, they are admhably calculated to overturn it. * It is weU known that the Sultan's first application for assistance was made to England ; his second to France, and it was only on finding it was not convenient for either of those powers to support him, that he threw himself under the protection of Russia.

Feeling this, he attaches immense value to the assistance which, he is aware, could always be obtained from the Krimea ; and we can imagine, that, impressed with this conviction, he will do nothing to compromise his title to receive it. The future is hidden from man, and we know not how long this empire of a city may last; but if, as there is reason to fear, an internal revolution should destroy what is now existing, it would be indispensable to establish a new order of things, and we ought there fore to be prepared to meet the change. The fall of the Turkish Empire may be hastened by the injudicious succour, or the unrequested presence of pretended friends, who, under the pretext of assistance, and of securing an independence for the Sultan, which is now impossible, wiU make it the theatre of war; infallibly give rise to the events that are dreaded, and produce the catastrophe we would wiUingly avert, although we feel it to be certain.* * In the account of my proceedings and my stay in Constantinople, I have adverted to the deposing of Sultan SeUm, whom Mustapha Bairactar undertook to replace on the throne ; and have briefly touched upon communications which I had with various Turkish chiefs.

In the year 1807, when I was commander-in-ehief of the army of Dalmatia, the Emperor being desirous of creating enemies to England and Russia (he was about to take the field against the latter), formed a close affiance with Turkey, and induced that state to declare war against the Russians. Napoleon contemplated confiding to me the command of an army of twenty-five thousand men to act in conjunction with the Turks, and he thought it possible we might carry war to the banks of the Indus. WhUe these operations were under consideration, I was directed to furnish the Grand Signor with such provisions, ammunition, cannon, &c. as he might require, and with officers of artUlery and engineers; and at a later period I was ordered to send to him troops of those branches of the service.

An intrigue of the Seragho caused this bUnd fanaticism to show itself in rebelhon. We had just succeeded in preventing Constantinople from falling into the hands of the English, when the Janissaries, displeased at the organization of regular troops, suddenly revolted, and made Sehm yield the throne to his uncle Mustapha. It was at first doubtful what would be the conduct of the new Sovereign towards France, and therefore we discontinued our supplies to him. Mustapha, however, adopted the pohcy of his predecessor; but the peace of Tilsit having altered that of Napoleon, he joined Russia ; and though previously directed to prepare the plan of a campaign in favour of Turkey, I was, on this change, ordered to discover the readiest way of capturing one of her provinces."], [212, "150 TOUR THROUGH ASIA MINOK AND STEIA.

The favourable state of the weather enabled us on the following morning to reach Moudania, a vUlage situated at the entrance of the Gulf from which its name is taken. Not far from thence the handsome city of Nic\u00e6a formerly stood ;* it was famed for the two Councils held there; for the memorable siege it sustained from the first Crusaders ; and also for the treachery of the Greek Emperor Alexis Comnenus, who deprived them of the fruits of their exertions when on the point of securing it.

It was situated on the border of Lake Ascanius, in the middle of a fertile country. * The ancient Nic\u00e6a was an inland city, and the site is partly occu pied by the modern Turkish town of \"Isnik.\" Its actual distance from the village of Moudania, which consists of a row of houses along the sea-shore, is between thirty and forty mUes.

The environs of Moudania are extremely fertde, highly cultivated, and covered with vines and olive trees. The whole of the vast peninsula of Asia Minor is equaUy favoured by nature, but there is a deficiency of inhabitants, and they are generally averse to labour, from a depressing conviction that their exertions would produce no profit to themselves. In the neighbour hood of Brusa this is not the case. Whether it is that theh proximity to Constantinople affords this people a httle more security, or that by chance a succession of less avaricious Pachas has given them a respite, to enjoy the produce of theh labour, I cannot determine ; but they are industrious, and the state of cultivation of the surrounding country is as extensive as could fairly be expected from their numbers. The country ascends gently as it recedes from the coast, and the vdlages are at a distance from the route I took, but they appeared in a prosperous state. We twice crossed the NUufer, which rises in one of the offsets of Olympus, and after a devious course falls into the sea of Marmora, ten leagues to the westward of Moudania. * This is a transposition of names, the present title of the village is \" GemWc,\" the ancient one \" Caius.\" (_\".)"], [214, "152 ASIA MINOR. Brusa stands near the base of the mountain, and is seen from a considerable distance. Its appearance is magnificent; for its extent, the number of its mosques, and the loftiness of its splendid domes, produce a most imposing effect upon the mind. The nearer you approach the town the more beautiful the scenery becomes ; streams of water flow in aU directions, giving freshness to the air, while Mount Olympus, towering above this rich and varied picture, stamps the whole with grandeur. Life and spirit are imparted to this lovely spot, by its industrious and ample population, and the immediate environs appear delightful. King Prusias was wise in seeking to hve here in a state of tranquil joy, shunning all that could endanger his possession of a land so favoured by nature. Brusa is a manufacturing town for articles of sdk, and the situation being very favourable for sUk-worms, they are kept here in great numbers, which leads to an extensive cultivation of the mulberry-tree. The system pursued in this district appeared to me the most judicious I had ever seen. It is usual, elsewhere, to grow beneath the mulberry plantations smaller trees or vegetables, but here that system is reversed, for the mulberry-trees are topped, giving them a poUard form, and lofty ohve, or other fruit trees, are placed in the intervals. The result is, that the fruit is as abundant as if the sod were appro priated entirely to its cultivation, and the produce in mulberry leaves is not diminished by theh growing in the shade, so that a double crop is obtained from the same portion of land. I consider this practice worthy of notice, from the perfect success that attends it. Brusa is the ancient Prusa.

The silks of Brusa are in high esti mation throughout Europe, and this town may be considered the Lyons of Turkey.* The greatest blessing and luxury of the East is an abundance of water. Brusa is pre-eminently fortunate in this respect, for Mount Olympus affords it a most ample supply from various levels, and the water being conducted with great judgment to every quarter of the town, contributes essentiaUy to the health and comfort of its inhabitants. This advantage, combined with the beauty of the surrounding scenery, makes Brusa a most agreeable place of residence. It is famed for its efficacious mineral waters, and its magnificent baths, the largest of which is in a beautiful style of architecture, lined with marble, and containing numerous basins.

Aladdin, the Sultan of Iconium, a weak prince, who was exposed to the incursions of other Tartar tribes, having heard of the wisdom, firmness, and justice of Ortogul, took him into his service, and gave him a tract of country on the banks of the river Sakaria,* about fifteen leagues distant from the Black Sea. The whole force of this chief consisted of four hun dred families, who were the founders of the Ottoman nation, and this place was its cradle. Though at first scarcely known, and far from powerful, they soon acquired sufficient strength to overturn the tottering thrones around them, and became so formidable as to threaten the liberties of Europe. This produced a great sensation, but their power was transitory, for they did nothing to render it firm and stable. The destiny and future grandeur of Ortogul and his descendants had been predicted; but observing the weakness of the throne of Iconium, and the anarchy prevading in the East, he had too much sagacity to require the aid of prophecy to indicate the career that was open to him.

Othman took possession of Yenisteims, but faded in his attempt on Prusa and Nicomedia, both defended by troops of the Greek Emperor of Constantinople. On the death of Othman, his son Orcan succeeded to the sovereignty ; and having renewed the attack on the first named city, it surrendered to him. The body of Othman was removed thither by Orcan, who was aware that this had been his father's wish, and thus funeral obsequies formed part of the victor's triumph. Orcan followed up the course which Othman had pursued, enlarging his dominions, and adding to the national glories. He selected Prusa, the capital of Bithynia, for his seat of government; and captured Nic\u00e6a, the second city of the Greek emphe, as well as Nicomedia. At a later period, crossing the HeUes pont, he appeared in Europe, and entering into the various combinations of the vacillating pohcy of the Greek Empire, profited by its dissensions. Finally, marrying the daughter of the Emperor Cantacuzene, he prepared the way for future conquests, and for establishing in Europe the influence of his people. Such is the history of the two illustrious men whose tombs we see enclosed within the mosque at the village of Cherche; monuments incommensurate with their great achievements. The rapid progress of the Ottoman Emphe in Europe soon caused the seat of government to be transferred from Brusa to Adrianople, and, therefore, Othman and Orcan were the only Sultans buried on the Asiatic shore.* * The author has been misinformed in this instance, as the Sultans Ilderim, Bayazid, and Amurath I. were also interred there.

We found vege tation extremely rich, the country adorned by magni ficent trees, and abundant streams flowing in various directions, giving a pleasing freshness to the sur rounding scenery. The more important springs are con ducted to embellish and supply the Armenian quarter ofthe town. Chesnut trees grow luxuriantly on this part of the mountain ; on a higher level evergreens of aU descrip tions are seen, and still nearer the summit there is an extent of table land, which only produces pasturage. In the summer this tract is occupied by Turcomans, a pastoral people, who change their place of abode according to the seasons, encamping either on the mountains or in the plains, as may best suit their flocks ; and they thus turn to account the produce of this district, which, from a deficiency of population, is uncultivated and abandoned by others, \u2014 yet this is Asia Minor, formerly so rich and powerful.

We steered for the Princes' Islands, where we arrived early on the morning of the fourth. They are thus named from having been, at the period of the Greek Empire, the place of exde for the banished princes. We landed at the Island of Khalki to visit two monasteries of early celebrity. One of them, which is only occupied by two monks, has a rich and highly ornamented church. The other, dedicated to the \"Panagia,\" has been converted into a school, and contains fifty pupds, sons of the principal Greek resi dents in Constantinople. AU communication with this estabhshment having been cut off, from an apprehension of the plague, which was then raging at Constantinople, we did not inspect it; but from the information I received, it appears to me that the system of instruction is good and sufficiently extensive.

In fact, in no other part of the globe is nature clothed with equal majesty and beauty. We set sail on the evening of the 6th for the Dar danelles, and I was much mortified on discovering that a very unfortunate selection had been made in engaging the Celestine, for she was so leaky as to render it necessary, from the very moment of our embarkation, to work the pumps for several hours daily ; and this incon venience continued throughout the two months we were on board, materiaUy increasing the labour of the crew, who, independently of this additional exertion, were insufficient for the duties required of them. This was an unpropitious commencement, but I determined to proceed in this vessel, for although not trustworthy for a winter voyage, I conceived she might answer for the summer cruize which I had in contemplation. But I had to submit to a grievous disappointment in parting with Dr. Seng; for the malady, that in the Black Sea had placed his life in peril, having returned upon him with extreme violence, it was obvious that he could not, without considerable danger, proceed on an excursion, the greater part of which would have to be performed by sea.

They were true to theh alliance with the Romans, and resisted Mithridates; but, like many other places in this part of Asia, Cyzicus was destroyed on the invasion of the barbarians. particularly a large one at the lower end, where the double arch has been carried across the stream. \" The lower part is very sohdly built of large squares of granite, and, from its size and height, it is visible at a considerable distance out to seaward. \" In addition to the ruins I have mentioned, we also saw what appears to have been a large cistern, or reservoir of water, now nearly fiUed up, but stiU affording the most pure and cold water I ever drank ; and, also, not far from the shore of the western gulf, a heap of ruins of some very large buUdings. It is of an oval form, about two hundred yards long, and one hundred wide ; and over the whole extent are strewed pieces of marble, many of which retain the marks of sculpture. \" The only part that remains perfect are three gaUeries, now under ground, but nearly on a level with the surrounding country. \" The centre one is about ten feet wide, and fourteen feet high, with a vaulted roof. A smaller one on each side, about six feet wide, com- municates with it by a narrow passage, and the walls which separate them are from eight to ten feet thick, and have within them, on one side of the gaUery, an ascending passage, probably a staircase, and on the other a weU of very pure water. The centre gaUery, where we entered, has an arched doorway, but appears to have been continued both ways for the whole length of the building. The furthest end is completely choked up by rubbish. The above description wiU give some idea of the formation of these vaults.\""], [225, "DARDANELLES. 163 We saw the island of Marmora, which produces the most beautiful marble of the East, and gives its modern name to the ancient Propontis. In passing the mouth of the Granicus, celebrated for marking the first step of the glorious career of the con queror of Asia, the commencement of the briUiant series of victories that astonished the world, was brought to our recollection. We observed the coast dedicated to the God of Gardens, the fortuity of which justified its selection for the sites of the temples erected to his worship. At length we reached the entrance to the straits of the Dardanelles, which varying in width, graduaUy diminishes tiU it is only fourteen hundred yards across. The form of the shores is peculiarly favourable for establishing an impassable defence, but the existing batteries are not in a state to stop a fleet attempting to force the passage with a strong leading wind. It is true that such a facility is rarely presented, because the prevaUing winds are northerly, and an additional obstacle to a rapid passage into the sea of Marmora is the constant current setting towards the Mediter ranean, at a rate of nearly four knots an hour* * The passage of the canal of the DardaneUes is rarely performed without some detention from unfavourable winds, frequently extending to five or six days, and occasionaUy to as many weeks ; and, therefore, it would be an enterprise of considerable risk, indeed of absolute temerity, for a hostile fleet to attempt it, unless it had previously landed a mUitary force on the European or the Asiatic shore, or on both, if possible, and taken possession of the coast defences. Probably two or three thousand men would succeed on either side in such an operation, for the present works, though formidable as sea batteries, might be easUy captured by a force attacking them in rear ; being imperfectly constructed and subject to a close command. In the year 1833, His Majesty's ship \" Act\u00e6on,\" Captain the Hon. F. W. Grey, took several days to work through this passage ; and such"], [226, "164 ASIA MINOR. The most formidable batteries were originally at the narrowest part of the canal, that is, near the village of the Dardanelles, and on the coast of Europe immediately having been the case with a smart frigate, we may presume that the detention of a fleet of such magnitude as would be required to enter the sea of Marmora for hostUe objects, would be stUl greater ; and that should England ever have occasion to adopt such a measure, she must attach to each ship of war sufficient steam power to be able to pass rapidly through the canal, hi defiance of unfavourable winds and the prevailing current. Captain Grey published in the \"Nautical Magazine\" an account of his voyage from Naples to Constantinople, and as that part which relates to the Straits of the DardaneUes, and the table of winds he has given must be interesting to such readers as are likely to visit that quarter, an extract from it is subjoined. \" On the morning of the 23rd we were under way, and, working up with a moderate breeze, at noon we entered the DardaneUes, with a north west wind, and ran up on the European shore, tiU nearly as high as Point Barbiere, when the wind coming from the N.E., we stood across and anchored off the white cliffs in ten fathoms. \" The next day we were under way twice with southerly winds, but each time the wind failing, we were forced to return to the anchorage off the cliffs. First bearings at anchor. Southernmost of the two white cliffs - - \u2022 S. E. \u00a3 E. Point Barbiere - - - - - - N. by E. E. In ten fathoms and a half, rather close to the shore.

In thirteen fathoms \u2014 a very good berth. \" From the slight examination I was enabled to give, it appears to me that the best anchorage is with the white cliff mentioned above, bearing from E. to E. by N. in ten to thirteen fathoms. To the east ward the shoal runs further off shore (full 250 fathoms), and is steeper to approach. Round the bight, where the low-land forming Point Barbiere runs out, it does not extend more than 150 fathoms; but from the point itself a spit runs a considerable distance to the south west. It does not appear to run out into the Strait to any distance ; in fact, the current runs so strongly close to the point, that the water must be deep."], [227, "165 DARDANELLES. opposite to it. These works, which in fact are castles, constructed many years back, are the centre of the defence, and numerous large batteries have been formed at their base, but with so little judgment, that the enemy's fire would soon render them untenable. \" On the afternoon of the 26th, we were again under way, with a fine breeze from the southward ; but it again faUed us before we had passed the formidable current, and we hauled over for the European side, and anchored about a cable's length from the shore, in fourteen fathoms, a little to the eastward of the large valley opposite Point Barbiere, marked in the chart Soundere, with the Upper Castle of Asia N.E. by E. I would recommend to ships in fine weather rather to anchor on this shore, than to cross to the white cliffs, as the wind at times comes from the north-west, and enables them to get up as high as the castles, by keeping the European shore on board ; and I have seen no instance of the wind coming from the south-east, so as to give the advantage to a ship on the southern shore. The water here is not so deep as, from the height of the land, I had expected to find it. Off the entrance of the stream which runs down the valley, a shoal runs out a short distance : the holding-ground appears good. There is anchorage all along this shore, from Point Barbiere up to the castles; in the bay below the castles, in from seven to thirteen fathoms; but in most places it is necessary to approach the shore very closely to get into a moderate depth. \" We remained at this anchorage, with variable weather and north east winds, tiU the morning of the 30th, when a fresh southerly breeze enabled us to pass the castles, and at two we passed GaUipoli, and steered E.N.E. This course carried us five mUes to the northward of Marmora, and at eight, having passed the centre of the island, we altered our course to east, and ran fifty-one miles, and then, seeing the land, we hauled up N.E. At 4 h. 20m. Point Stefano bore N.W. two miles; at six we passed the Sultan's palace; at 7h. 50m. came to, off Yelikeni Point. The next morning we shifted our berth to off Mezar-Bournou Point. \" Therapia, May 1st to Jan. 1st, 1834. \u2014 During the summer months our anchorage was at about If cable's length west from the point of the Asiatic shore off Therapia; both in order to be near the palace, and from its being considered much more healthy to be in the full draught of the sea breeze, than by a nearer approach to the marshy ground at the entrance of the river, to run the risk of the fevers so prevalent in"], [228, "166 ASIA MINOR. There are great natural faculties on both shores for placing artillery in the most advantageous positions for disputing the passage ; and it is evident, from the general conformation of the coasts, that to render this maritime defence perfect, additional works ought to be constructed, more inland than the existing forts, for by aU the valleys and low grounds in the month of August. Whether owing to this precaution or not, during the whole summer we had only one case of fever, and that, although severe, not fatal. \" The holding-ground is not of the best kind ; but with a good scope of cable (we veered to 100 fathoms chain), there is no risk of the ship driving, certainly not with westerly and southerly winds, which alone would be dangerous ; and the current, with few exceptions, I beUeve I might say during the summer without an exception, running constantly down, a ship never goes near her anchor. The shoals a-head in a great measure prevent the risk there might otherwise be of vessels coming down running on board. In fact, I recommend this anchorage as much the best in summer. \" Upon our return to the Bosphorus in November, we took up a berth with the above point N.N.W. of us, about l\u00a3 cable's length from the mouth of a river ; and we found it so sheltered, that in the heavy gale of the 15th and 16th of December, which did so much damage in the Black Sea and Archipelago, the ship rode perfectly easy, without veering any cable. A French brig-of-war, in Therapia harbour, roUed very heavily, and had great difficulty in keeping clear of the two or three other vessels lying there. In the month of May and beginning of June, the weather was cold and rainy, the N.E. winds being often accompanied by cold damp fogs from the Black Sea. From the beginning of June to the middle of September, there was no rain, the weather fine, and the heat seldom oppressive. Towards the end of September the weather broke up, and we had squalls and rain ; and in the beginning of October the weather was variable and unsettled. From the 12th of October to the 8th of November, we were absent from the Bosphorus. \" On the 9th and 10th of November the wind was southerly, with fine weather; and from that time to the 3rd of December the N.E. wind blew almost without interruption, sometimes fresh and cold. During the month of December the wind was generaUy from the south ward; on the 13th it blew fresh from the westward, and the same night shifted suddenly to the N.W. and then N.E., where it freshened"], [229, "167 DARDANELLES. such an arrangement the new sites would admit of the guns enfilading the hne of the canal, and crippling the hostde vessels at a distance ; whereas the position of the present batteries precludes them from annoying up by the following night to one of the heaviest gales known here for many years, accompanied by heavy rain and sleet. On the 16th it moderated, and again -came from tbe southward. On the 26th it blew fresh from tbe S.W., and in the night the wind again suddenly shifted to the northward, and blew hard for two days from N.E., when it again came to the southward.\" Tbe following table shows the prevailing winds : \u2014 Table of Winds.\u2014 Therapia, 1833.

The defences shoidd be considerably increased at Nagara, and the batteries attached to the castles of the Darda neUes, reconstructed or improved. I do not allude merely to that absurd defence which is more an imagi nary than a real one, formed by pieces of artillery (without carriages) of large calibre, intended for throw ing marble shot. The direction of their fire being at right angles to the canal, each gun can only discharge one shot at a vessel, and that at the moment she is opposite to it ; but my observation applies to the whole system, which requires to be remodelled. It would not be difficult to form a good land defence against a force that might be disembarked, by enclosing the castle and batteries of the viUage of the DardaneUes within per manent works of considerable extent, presenting five bastions towards the interior of the country. Such a fortress could not be taken without a regular siege, and the mountains are too distant to render theh command injurious. It would be equaUy easy to cover the bat teries of Nagara. A mound of earth which now forms a screen, might be occupied by two small fronts of fortification, and near the extremity of the table land, at a place called Maltepe, there should be a smaU isolated fort, and an enclosed battery. The fortress, the battery, and the works of Nagara, from mutually supporting each other, would present so formidable a resistance, that an army recently landed, and possessing therefore very limited resources, could two-thirds of the time ; \u2014 a sufficient preponderance of adverse wind to cause apprehension for any fleet not abundantly suppUed with steamers, that might attempt to force the passage in the face of batteries, which on the two sides mount upwards of 750 pieces of ordnance. (T.)"], [231, "169 DARDANELLES. have no hope of succeeding in an attack on this position. As to the opposite point, on the European shore, the country being very broken and the coast elevated, the defences should consist of three good forts of small dimensions, with casemated redoubts similar to those at Coblentz. The proper position for them would be at once seen by an experienced engineer, and under the protection of these works the sea batteries might be much extended. The first or exterior point of defence of the Darda neUes is lower down, at Koom-Kale. The battery established there sees the entrance of the canal from the \u00c6gean Sea ; but although containing a considerable number of cannon, and strengthened towards the country by a keep, which serves as a redoubt, it is very inefficient, owing to its defective construction. It might be built on an improved plan, and covered against land attacks, by a regular work; although I consider this super fluous, for a good sea defence, established on this point, would be sufficient, and it would therefore be better to appropriate to the DardaneUes such funds as the autho rities might be inclined to expend at Koom Kale. It is impossible to sail on the canal of the Hellespont without its bringing to our recollection the great events of former times. The immense bridges, for instance, formed by Xerxes for the passage of his army, in his attack on Greece ; a proof of vanity rather than of skill or wisdom. Our thoughts are then carried back to that glorious and brdliant enterprise, the success of which could only have resulted from the genius of its leader, Alexander, who at the head of a small but brave army, subdued, in less than four years, the whole of Asia, giving a striking example of the magic power of I"], [232, "170 ASIA MINOR. discipline and order, the value of which the Greeks had previously shown, by repelling the confused multitudes that twice invaded them ; but in those instances they had fought upon theh own soil, well provided with everything required for a vigorous defence, while, on the contrary, their enemies had been exposed to great privations, partly arising from their numbers. In the instance of the Greek invasion of Asia, we find a force barely amounting to thirty thousand men, not merely defeating and dispersing the numerous armies that opposed them, but subduing entire nations and taking possession of an extensive territory. Those who have been employed against the nations of the East, know that, from a deficiency of system and organization, their armies possess no unity of action, each individual conducting himself according to the impulse of his feelings and his courage ; and, there fore, however great their numerical superiority, they cannot have a prospect of success against the compact and firmly cemented mass, which disciplined and weU trained troops present. Hence our surprise should not be caused so much by the defeat of the Persian army by Alexander, as by his being enabled, with such slen der means to retain possession of the country. I saw at the Dardanelles, Mehemed Pacha, the com mandant of that district, who received me with atten tion, and made the necessary arrangements for my excursion, on the foUowing day, to the plain of Troy. On the morning of the 8th, we went by water to the fort of Koom-Kale, and after a short visit to the Aga, with whom we partook of coffee, and smoked the pipe of ceremony, we mounted our horses to proceed on our journey. That the names of the heroes of the Trojan war"], [233, "171 TROY, should have been transmitted to us, through a period of three thousand years, is less to be ascribed to their renown than to that of the immortal poet who has sung their deeds ; and Achilles, Patroclus, and Hector, are but ornaments of the frame in which the noble portrait of Homer is placed. It required all the power of the father of poetry to hand down to us, surrounded with lustre, the names of those who were engaged in contests which, had they occurred in these days, would not have been known beyond the sphere in which they happened. But the imaginative genius of Homer was enabled to express, in sublime language, the passions of the human heart, unveU its secrets, and give a faithful portraiture of man in the midst of the vicissitudes of life ; and his admhable descriptions have raised the most trivial actions into importance. It is therefore the fame of Homer that draws us to the plain of Troy; and with the interest excited by the study of his immortal works, we contemplate the spot to which he has imparted its celebrity. We took with us both the Iliad and the work of Le Chevalber, in examining the country between the sea and the rillage of Bounarbashi, which incontestibly stands on the site of ancient Troy. With such a guide as Le ChevaUier, it is impossible to err ; so accurate are his descriptions, that you immediately discover the places mentioned by Homer, and appear to be amongst the heroes he has sung. The strand comprised between the height adjoining Koom-Kale, and that on the right bank of the Imbris, was evidently occupied by the Greek fleet ; the anchor age is good, and the ships could have been drawn ashore, according to the practice of that time. The camp of the Greeks, placed in front and covered by I 2"], [234, "172 ASIA MINOR. intrenchments, protected the fleet ; the position was strengthened on one flank by the heights terminating at Cape Sigeum, and on the other by the mouth of the river. On the right of the encampment were the tombs of Achilles and Patroclus ; the tumuli which bear their names having doubtless been the places of sepulture of these warriors. At a short distance from thence are seen the ruins of a temple, dedicated to Minerva, as well as the tomb of Antilocus, one of the earliest victims of the Trojan war. The Scamander and the Simois, winding through the plain, cannot be mistaken, and the course of both may be easily followed. The former is a tranquil stream, fed by various springs that rise near the city, and the latter an impetuous torrent. The Scamander, below the point where the Simois falls into it, crosses the encampment of the Greeks; and its direction clearly shews the position of their in trenchments, which its overflow destroyed. The con fluence of these rivers appeared to me to be nearer to Tioy than is shown upon the maps. The fertile plain that divided the Grecian camp from the city of Troy, or from the encampment established by the Trojans, in front of their city, was the usual field of battle. The site of the gateway, through which the Trojans made theh sorties, is discernible, near the sources of the Scamander, the weakest and most accessible part of the city. The opposite side commands the plain, and forms an isolated height, enclosed by the Simois. This portion of the ground corresponds perfectly with the descrip tion of the Acropolis, where the temple of Minerva stood, and where the wooden horse was introduced. The tomb of Hector can also be distinguished, formed"], [235, "173 TROY by an accumulation of stones, heaped on each other. From the site of Troy may be seen the tumulus of Daisyetes, and the posts for watching the movements of the Greeks. In fact there is not a single spot described by the poet that Le Chevallier has faUed to discover. Nothing can be more creditable to his discernment, or better prove the attention he must have bestowed on his researches. Formerly there was great obscurity and doubt regarding everything connected with these matters, but he has lifted up the veil, and there is now no point remaining for discussion. I inspected the ruins of a temple in the middle of the plain, near the village of Kanes-Kieui ; they are very imposing, and consist of magnificent marble columns, capitals, and various highly finished orna ments. At the village of Tchiblack I found other remains of antiquity, such as the site of the \" Novum Ilium,\" embellished by the Romans, and the temple of Apollo Tymbri, which stood at a short distance to the eastward, and beyond the stream. I was informed that the English had made extensive and valuable coUections at this spot. On quitting the village of Tchiblack, I repaired to Bounarbashi, where at every step, I met with proofs of being on the very ground formerly occupied by the celebrated city whose history has been transmitted to us by the greatest and first of poets. I ascertained the tem d erasure of the sources of the Scamander to be 17T5\u201e degrees \" centigrades,\"* but I could not find any trace of the hot spring mentioned by travellers as falhng into that river. Although I had procured camp equipage at Con- * Equal to 63^ degrees of Fahrenheit. (_\".)"], [236, "174 ASIA MINOR. stantinople, I did not expect it would be necessary in my excursion, to the ruins of Troy; and having left it on board the Celestine, we took up our quarters in a respectable looking house at Bounarbashi, but it is impossible to describe what we suffered from the attacks of myriads of iusects that beset us \u2014 a scourge to which it appears all the houses of Asia Minor are subject. It is surprising that the inhabi tants can bear, what must be a daily torture, unless their physical organization renders them insensible to an evil that we found insupportable. We left Bounarbashi on the morning of the 9th, and after a few hours' journey through a partly cultivated country, reached the rains of Alexandria- Troas, now called Eski-Stamboul. This city was founded by Alexander, and, with the exception of Alexandria in Egypt, was the largest of the eighteen cities of the same name, built by that conqueror. He directed Antigonus, one of his captains, to super intend its construction. This spot must have been splendidly beautiful, and was probably selected by Alexander from that circumstance as weU as from its vicinity to the sea. Faithful to the Romans in their war with Antiochus, the same privileges were granted to Alexandria-Troas as to the cities of Italy, and having the marked protection of Augustus, it was colonised by Romans, who held sacred all the institutions of theh mother country. This was one of the first cities that adopted the christian faith. Within the last forty years, many of its magnifi cent ruins have been removed, to be used as ma terials in the construction of buddings at Constan-"], [237, "ALEXANDRIA-TROAS. 175 tinople, the Dardanelles, and other places on the coast. The marble columns have been sawed into blocks, and rounded, to form baUs for the large guns used in the defence of the straits. The only ruins that are standing are portions of the walls of an extensive palace of the Doric order, on an elevated situation about two miles from the sea, of which there is a commanding view from this spot. We traced the enclosures of the gardens, and from them were enabled to form an opinion of the extent of the city. We observed, on the coast, the remains of some ancient works that must have belonged to the harbour, and on the outside of the city, the ruins of an aqueduct several miles in length. At no great distance was the cemetery; and among the tombs there is one of a style of masonry in use at Rome between the eras of Augustus and Diocletian. About four mUes from the sea-shore and on the southern side, beyond the hmits of the city, there is a thermal spring that formerly supplied the baths. A statue of the infant Hercules having been dis covered there, it is presumed that the baths were dedicated to that God, a not infrequent practice with the ancients. Nothing can be more deplorable than the state of the present baths, but the waters are represented as being efficacious, especially in cases of rheumatism and gout. They are very warm and saline, depositing in large quantities pure marine salt, and oxide of iron. Having been deprived of my thermometer by an accident, I had not the means of accurately deter mining theh temperature, but it is at least 60"], [238, "176 ASIA MINOR. degrees \" centigrades.\"* In this neighbourhood I saw for the first time a species of oak, which I after wards met with on the coast, in the district of Smyrna. The trees are planted at a distance from each other, and are generally of stunted growth. They produce a considerable quantity of fruit called \"valonia.\" It is a kind of round kernel, having a very thick coat, covered with leaves resembling those of the artichoke. When unripe it is roasted and eaten hke a chesnut, but when mature it is only fit for cattle. The value of the crop is chiefly in the coat, which is used in the operations of tanning, and as a varnish for paint ings. The quantity gathered on this coast is sufficient to freight annually twenty ships of between 150 and 200 tons burthen. Dry valonia is sold for about forty-five piasters the quintal. An annual firman authorises its exportation, and the Seraskier, who obtains this authority, receives a tribute as his recompense. The trees are the property of a great number of individuals, some of whom do not possess more than four or five of them. After minutely inspecting aU that was interesting in the ruins of Alexandria- Troas, I returned on board my vessel, which was waiting for me off the coast. Near us, was the island of Tenedos, situated as if it were intended as a point of observation, opposite the mouth of the HeUespont; at some distance, we saw the larger island of Lemnos, apparently destined to be the barrier of the West, and the point of \" appui \" of the maritime power that wiU have to keep in check the forces of Russia, at the exit of * 140 degrees of Fahrenheit. (T.)"], [239, "177 LEMNOS. the straits. The prosperity of Russia requires that she should have the privdege of using this passage i but if exclusively her own, she woidd be enabled to threaten the liberties of Europe.* * Tenedos lies at the distance of about three miles from the main land. It is of a triangular shape, and its base, which is nearly four mUes in length, faces the Asiatic shore. From wherever approached, it presents a conical appearance, but the summit of the hill is nearest to the eastern side of the island. The coast is generally bold, and in some parts precipitous. The town bears the same name as the island, and is situated at its north-eastern point, extending along the shore; it eon tains nearly the whole of the population, estimated at five thousand persons. The island is amply supplied with good water, and produces wine of exceUent quahty. There is a pier to the north of the town, which may afford facilities for landing, but it can hardly be said to form a shelter for shipping, or give just reason for Tenedos being regarded as a port. It is chiefly frequented by vessels waiting for a fair wind to pass through the Hellespont, but those of large tonnage generally anchor in the open roadstead between the island and the continent, where they are tolerably sheltered, excepting from southerly winds. The depth of water is from eight to eighteen fathoms, and a current runs south ward at the rate of about a mue and a quarter per hour. When it blows strong from the north, the shipping move round to leeward of the island. There is an old Turkish fort on the side of the hUl in rear of the town, but its construction is not such as to admit of a protracted defence. In the event of its being necessary for England to blockade the Dardanelles, she should have possession not only of Tenedos, where the steamers or other light craft for observation would be placed, but Lemnos should also be under her control, and be made the depot and place of rendezvous for the fleet. It is much larger than Tenedos, and has two beautiful harbours, one on the north and the other on the south shore. The southern and eastern sides of the island are the most fertUe, and abound with springs of fine water. The exports of Lemnos are oU, wine, and cotton. It is famed for the skiU of its pilots, and the sea faring qualities of its male inhabitants. (7\\) I 3"], [240, "178 ASIA MINOR. My intention was to pass between the main land and the island of Mytilene, the ancient Lesbos, so celebrated for the beauty and dissolute manners of its women. I wished to examine that coast closely, but we were obliged to sail to the westward of the island, having been too late in getting under way. On the 10th, we sailed into the magnificent gulf of Smyrna, beyond all comparison the finest in the world, and worthy of being the avenue to the first commercial city of the east; for its extensive and excellent anchorage, affording shelter from every wind, is suited to the accommodation of enormous fleets as well as of single vessels, and presents extraordinary facilities either for their arrival or departure, owing to the prevalence of the sea breeze throughout the day, and the land wind at night. On the same evening we anchored, at about three leagues' distance from the city, near the new fort constructed for the protection of the coasting trade, and on the Ilth we entered the harbour. Smyrna stands in a splendid position, and its'envi rons possess extraordinary beauty. The city is budt in the form of an amphitheatre at the entrance of a large and fertile valley, and extends from and about the middle of Mount Pagus to the plain. The Frank quar ter, composed of numerous handsome and spacious houses, is on the sea shore ; the whole overlooked by the old castle, built in the days of Alexander, on the summit of the mountain. Smyrna existed at a period anterior to the earliest historical records, and is said to have been founded by an Amazon, who gave it her name, which it has retained unchanged. When peopled by an Ephesian colony, it was destroyed by the Lydians, aud the"], [241, "SMYRNA. 179 wretched inhabitants and their posterity were dispersed, for a period of four hundred years, throughout the sur rounding country. It was rebuilt by Alexander, who constructed a fort for its defence, and from that period, with a greater or less degree of prosperity, it has con tinued to the present day. Of the several cities claim ing the honour of being the birth-place of Homer, Smyrna seems to have the best pretensious ; for it is certain that he was during many years an inhabitant of that city. In foUowing the banks of the Meles, a small river which flows round the town, and beyond Mount Pagus, we feel a certainty of being on the soil that was trodden by the immortal poet. When Smyrna was rebuilt by Alexander's orders, it was under the superintendence of Antigonus and Lysi machus, and that city soon became one of the richest and most powerful in Asia. Mount Pagus abundantly supplied the marble and other materials required, and its sides formed the base of the theatres and many important edifices. Smyrna was an object of the special protection of the Roman Emperors, and under their rule, it was much beautified, and acquired the title of the ornament of the East. It was enriched by commerce, to the prosperity of which every circumstance seemed to contribute, and became the point of re-union of a set of sophists, who assembled there and at Ephesus. Strabo, who lived in the time of Augustus, thus describes it : \" The Lydians having destroyed Smyrna, its population was dispersed, and for four hundred years, their descendants were without a home ; but it was restored by Antigonus and Lysima chus, and is now the most beautiful of cities. A small part stands upon the mountain, and the remainder ex-"], [242, "180 ASIA MINOR. tends over the plain, towards the harbour, the temple of Cybele, and the gymnasium. The quarters are nearly divided at right angles, and the streets are paved. There are several square porticos, of considerable dimen sions, a library, and a Homerium, that is to say a square portico containing a temple dedicated to Homer, and having his statue. The Smyrniots claim that poet as belonging to them, and a certain copper coin in cir culation in the city, bears his name. The river Meles flows near the city, which, besides its numerous other advantages, has a harbour that may be closed.\" Saint Polycarp the Martyr, a disciple of Saint John, was the first Bishop of Smyrna. In the eleventh cen tury the city fell into the hands of the Mussulmans, but on being recaptured by Ducas, the Admiral of the Greeks, was again annexed to their empire. In the thirteenth century, Smyrna being in ruins, the Emperor John Angelo Comnenus caused its restoration. In 1322 it became a part ofthe dominions of Sultan Amir, and in 1345, during his temporary absence the Knights of Rhodes presented themselves before the city in the hope of taking it by surprise, but having failed in this attempt, they established themselves in tbe neighbour hood, and for the purpose of keeping the Turks in check, constructed fort St. Peter. Sultan Amir ineffec tually tried to dislodge them from it, but Tamerlane, who in 1402 ravaged Asia, captured Smyrna after an attack of only fourteen days' duration, put to death a great number of the natives, and forced the Knights of Rhodes, who still occupied fort St. Peter, to em bark. At a later period it was taken by Mahomet the Fhst, and having from that time ceased to be the scene of contention, the number of its inhabitants increased"], [243, "181 SMYRNA. and it again became the most important commercial city on the Asiatic shore of the Mediterranean. Smyrna is now the greatest, and, indeed, almost the only place of commerce, in the Turkish dominions, and wiU probably retain that pre-eminence, notwithstanding the ill-advised efforts which have been made to remove its trade to Constantinople. The position of Smyrna gives it a most decided superiority over every other city of the Ottoman empire, not only because it is situated in a fertile district, has an industrious population, and lies on the direct line of communication between the principal European markets and the centre of Asia Minor, but also because its commercial reputation is of long standing, the intercourse of its merchants with other countries is very extensive; and, above all, be cause of the great facility of access to its port. Con stantinople has none of these advantages, and the pre vailing winds and currents of the Hellespont render the navigation of this approach to the sea of Marmora always tedious, and sometimes impracticable for many months in succession. The articles of trade intended for the Russian markets, for which it may have been supposed that Constantinople would be the entrepot, will stUl be carried by the Russian merchants, direct to their places of destination, as nothing but expense to the consumer could result from any other system. The attempts to change the existing order of things, are therefore so manifestly contrary to the true interests of the state, that we may conclude they will prove unsuc cessful. Smyrna has the general characteristics of eastern cities, the streets being narrow, and the greater number of the houses constructed of wood, but they are hand somer than those of any other place in Asia Minor, and"], [244, "182 ASIA MINOR. a tolerably efficient police keeps the city in good order. The important position of its numerous European inha bitants has great influence in improving the customs and manners ofthe people. The population amounts to eighty thousand : of this number one-half are Turks, who since the period of the Greek revolution have not shown that haughtiness and pride which formerly marked theh deportment ; the remainder are Greeks, Armenians, Jews, and Europeans of various denominations. Of these several races, the most numerous are the Greeks. The women of that nation, who are exquisitely lovely, strive to follow the customs of Europe ; and the example they set, as well as the influence they exercise on aU around them, tends to soften the general manners and increase the spread of civilization. Smyrna is the only sociable city of the East, and there is not any other in which a European can find a resemblance of his own country, or a style of living that recalls it to his memory. The body of Con suls General, at Smyrna, is better composed than in any other eastern city. The good taste of the individuals, aided by the extensive means they possess, render their houses very agreeable. I had reason to feel much indebted to all these gentlemen, and particularly to M. Chalet, the Consul General of France, who takes the lead; to M. de Sestiaux, the Consul General of Austria, and to M. Van Leneps, the Consul General of the Netherlands. I first inspected the city aud its immediate envhons, following the course of the Meles, \"the divine Meles.\" In these sultry climates, water is so peculiarly necessary, so scarce, and therefore so precious, that it was natural for the ancient poets to deify their rivers. The water of the Meles is of good quahty, but not"], [245, "183 SMYIiNA. abundant. It issues from a narrow dell, at the base of the eastern side of the Pagus, and winding through the plain behind Smyrna, takes its course to the sea. Its celebrity is derived solely from the poet who sang its praise. At a short distance from the city, and beyond the Meles, there are several springs which form a small lake. Ancient ruins, and fragments of beautiful marbles, are still visible upon its banks \u2014 memorials of former grandeur, while the rushes and weeds that are growing undisturbed among them afford a proof of the degeneracy of the present times. This sheet of water bears the pompous title of Diana's baths, for a temple was erected there in honour of that goddess. A great proportion of the water of this lake, might be drained off, both for useful and ornamental purposes ; but at present it is only applied to washing. I mea sured the temperature of a spring within the city, called the Pacha's fountain, supposed to rise from a consider able depth, and found it to be twenty degrees \" centi grades;\" that of the lake was 18 degrees.* There must be a considerable subterraneous heat at Smyrna, to give so high a temperature to water issuing from the ground. As I have already said, the castle was built by Alexander, and it has since been considerably enlarged. The more ancient parts of the work are discoverable by the evidence they afford of superior construction. The greater part of the additions were made in the time of the Greek Emperors, at which period were also formed the immense subterraneous works communi cating with the city. The Imperial Eagle is engraved on several parts of the enclosure wall; and in the * Equal to 68\u00b0 and 64^\u00b0 Fahrenheit. (T.)"], [246, "184 ASIA MINOR. masonry near the gate there is a colossal bust of a woman, supposed to be that of the Amazon from whom, according to a tradition, for which I could find no good authority, Smyrna took its name. After my tour of the city, I visited the neighbour hood commencing with the hot-springs on the southern side of the gulf. They bear the name of Liggia; but in Greek \"Leggia\" means bath, it is therefore a generic and not a proper name. Strabo speaks of these waters as being situated on the route between Smyrna and Clazomene : the latter was a celebrated city on the isthmus of the peninsula which borders a part of the gulf of Smyrna : on its site the village of Vourla now stands. At no distant period these baths were re-estabhshed. The waters have a temperature of 56 degrees \" centigrades;\"* but they are tasteless, and it is presumed that if analyzed they would only be found to contain a smaU quantity of carbonate of iron. Although nature has been prodigal of her gifts to the district I passed over, yet it is almost without inhabitants, and uncultivated : a few ohve trees com posing its whole wealth. I afterwards repaired to the vUlage of Sedikioi, which contains some country-houses, inhabited by Greeks and Europeans, and stands at a considerable distance from the sea-shore ; the intervening space is in a neg lected state and covered with stunted trees. The environs of the vUlage are delightful, having been beautified by judicious and tasteful improvements. We were hospitably received by the family of a Greek physician. The ladies were extremely beautiful, and their manners most fascinating. The modern Greek women have all the attractions and natural endowments ' 133\u00b0 Fahrenheit. (T.)"], [247, "185 SMYRNA, that the women of theh country so pre-eminently possessed in ancient times. We returned by Bougia, where vUlas still more abound, as this situation is preferred from its greater proximity to Smyrna; but a deficiency of water dimi nishes the comforts of the place. The ground over which we traveUed in returning is extremely fertile, but a great proportion of it is uncul tivated, notwithstanding its vicinity to the city \u2022 indeed in the immediate environs of Smyrna, at least one third of the land lies in a faUow state, and the interior vaUeys of Asia Minor, whose soil is of the finest quality, are in a still more deplorable condition. Those who possess accurate information on the subject assert, that not more than a twentieth part of the productive soil of this peninsula is now used for agricultural purposes, and as the circumstances which caused this state of desolation remain unchanged, no improvement can be hoped for, but on the contrary the evil wiU increase, until at length this beautiful and fertile country, so favoured by its climate, wiU gradually lose its inha bitants and become a desert. On the following day I made an excursion to Bour nabat, where there are many handsome country-houses, containing every luxury and comfort. I afterwards ascended the neighbouring mountains, on which I saw, in the middle of a precipitous rock, five smaU caverns, caUed Homer's grotto. Thus is the memory of this immortal poet stiU cherished and revered; a feeling highly creditable to the people. One of the charms of the East is, the frequent occur rence of names which were illustrious in the most remote periods of history, awakening recoUections of our youth, and constituting perhaps the greatest plea sures of our closing years."], [248, "186 ASIA MINOR. A stream, called the Achelaus, flows at the foot of the rock, and at a short distance unites with another river, called the Meles, but not the Meles of Smyrna. Which of them is entitled to the name they both bear, I cannot determine, but I should be inclined to award it to the river of the city. After travelling for two hours, and having passed the chain of mountains, we reached an uncultivated valley, near a small lake, whose picturesque banks are ornamented with trees. This is the lake of Tantalus, and it was here that the Phrygian king suffered the punishment inflicted by the gods for having offered to them his horrible feast. So pure and limpid is this water, that it cannot be approached without our feeling a desire to partake of it. The springs which add their tribute to the lake, and those on the side of the mountain, differ in temperature according to their elevation. That of the former was 14-5 degrees \" centigrades ;\" the water of the lake, in the shade, was 22-5 degrees; a hundred yards higher there was a spring at 125 degrees, and another below the level of the lake at 15 degrees.* Thus it appears that by a constant law of nature the temperature of springs bears a relation to theh levels. We breakfasted on the banks of Lake Tantalus. M. Issaverdeus, a kind-hearted merchant of Smyrna, and the son of M. Chalet, a young man, fuU of ardour and activity, were of the party. Some Turco mans, encamped at a short distance from our resting place, wiUingly supplied us with milk. These people, who prefer occupying the most lofty and solitary regions, are much dreaded by travellers; but they * The above-stated temperatures correspond with 58\u00b0, 73\u00b0, 55\u00b0, and 59\u00b0, of Fahrenheit's scale.

(T.)"], [249, "187 SMYRNA. have never been known to refuse hospitality to such as have claimed theh assistance, although they assert the hberty to act as they please towards those who do not seek their aid or protection, and even regard it as justifiable to rob them. The number and bearing, however, of the persons they meet, doubtless influence their conduct, and the treatment we experienced from them only gave us cause to speak in their praise. From the top of the mountains, an immense tract of country is visible. On one side the valley of Smyrna, and the extensive plain of Sedikioi; on the other the plain of Menimen, which is tbe beginning of that of Magnesia, and the course of the Hemus. That river falls into the sea about four leagues to the northward of Smyrna, and its banks are extremely fertile, though the adjacent mountains are utterly barren. A few scattered trees are to be seen, but there is no mass of timber deserving the name of a forest. This is a general feature of the mountains of Asia, as it is of aU lofty countries of early civilization. Because theh population having formerly been very numerous, it was indispensable to cut the wood for domestic and other purposes ; and the wars and revolu tions in which the inhabitants were engaged, and the disorders that ensued, not only precluded them from adopting measures to preserve such trees as remained, but also prevented their planting others, to repair the mischief that had been done. When Asia Minor fell into the power of the Turks, no amelioration of this kind could be expected, because, predisposed as these conquerors were to destruction, they continued to devastate, until at length the mountains, despoiled of their trees, lost their verdant appearance, and became a barren tract. When ancient legislators proclaimed"], [250, "188 ASIA MINOR. the sacredness of woods, they were inspired by Heaven itself. The whole of the valonia produced in this extensive country, and that coUected from the Troad, is exported from Smyrna; the total annual quantity, amounting to nearly fifteen thousand tons, is worth about three millions of francs. So many circumstances combine to promote the commerce of Smyrna, that it prospers in defiance of the prevailing disorder and misrule. It appears from the registry of its exports and imports in the year 1833, that the value of the former was 74,692,129 piasters, and of the latter, 50,359,454, a difference in favour of the exports of 24,332,675 piasters, equal to 6,803,168 francs. Thus there is a gradual increase of the capital of this country. Formerly the wealth of this part of Asia Minor must have been very considerable, from the number of its inhabitants, theh activity, industry, and civilization. There were then numerous towns in a flourishing con dition, whose commerce placed them in communication with the shores of the Mediterranean, as well as with some of the ports of the Atlantic Ocean, and a careful system of cultivation increased the value of this fertUe land. The public edifices, of which we see the remains on this part of the coast of Asia, possessed such extra ordinary beauty, and were so numerous, that those belonging to a single city would now constitute a monarch's fame, or his country's ornament. A Muetzelim at present commands at Smyrna, and the whole authority of the province centres in him. He is both the comptroller and farmer of the taxes, and there is but little question that his personal"], [251, "189 SMYRNA. interest is the first object of his care. His agents collect the tenth of the annual produce, but instead of deducting it justly and fairly, they fix an arbitrary value on it, and regulate their exactions according to this estimate. If the proprietor complain, he is dis missed without redress, and in lieu of the authorities being then satisfied with his only paying the original value put on the tenth of his crop, they increase the impost to a sixth or even a fifth of the annual produce. The same oppression and mismanagement prevaU throughout the whole of the Pacbalicks, as each Pacha wrings from those dependent on him everything that he can obtain for his own profit. The Muetzelim is also farmer of the excise, and deals with those duties in the way most likely to serve him self. In fact everything is intrusted to this functionary, who gradually exhausts the fortunes of the proprietors, and thus saps the power of the sovereign. There can be no doubt that not even a fourth part of what is levied reaches the coffers of the Sultan. Formerly the abuses were greater than at present, and the exactions more frequent; but Christians alone were then the victims of these evds, for until the destruction of the Janissaries, the Turks preserved their power and retained their wealth ; but now they are joint sufferers with the other inhabitants, living in equal wretched ness and degradation. The natural result of the present condition of the people is, that there is such a universal feeling of mistrust and discontent, that the cultivation of the land is neglected, and the Turks merely sow sufficient to produce a crop for the sup port of their famUies and the payment of their taxes. There being no means in Turkey of establishing an improved and equitable system, the present course of"], [252, "190 ASIA MINOR. disorder must continue. The necessities of the govern ment will become daily greater, forming an excuse for fresh exactions, which will increase proportionately with the rapacity of the Sultan's agents, who, under the pretext of contributing to the wants of the state, wUl pillage from every one within their jurisdiction. To effect the required amelioration of these provinces the throne of Constantinople should be filled by a man of commanding genius, with sufficient energy of cha racter to disengage himself from such a miserable throng as now surrounds the present Sultan ; and even a sovereign so qualified would require the assistance of a number of enlightened and able men, not only weU informed as to the feelings of the nation, but acquainted with its capabilities, and competent to apply the latter for the utmost advantage of their country. In short, the required combination of circumstances does not now exist, and it is feared that it cannot be created. We left Smyrna on the morning of the 17th, and on the following day sailed out of the gulf, doubling Cape Karabouroun and entering the canal of Scio. It was my intention to have visited that island, formerly so rich, but now so desolate, had not the dread of a quarantine caused me to relinquish the project; for my curiosity was not sufficiently excited to induce me to gratify it at the expense of the time I should have lost by such a detention. The coast seems still to be cultivated, and to have a number of houses standing upon it ; but many of those which at a distance appear to ornament the country, are found on a nearer view, to be the monuments of its disasters, for they are half demolished, and this state of ruin Dnngs to the recoUection of the traveUer, the"], [253, "SCIO. 191 misfortunes which lately befel its wretched inhabitants, and heightens the gloom produced by this scene of desolation. In the year 1826, Colonel Fabvier, who had organ ized a regular corps in Greece, undertook to drive the Turks from the fort they occupied in the island of Scio, in order to unite its population to the Greek confedera tion. This fort is situated on the sea shore, and being commanded by the adjacent heights, might have been expected to offer but a short resistance to the besieging force; since, however, Colonel Fabvier, who was an officer of reputation, failed in his attempt, we must infer that he was deficient iu the requisite means to reduce the place. This ill-timed attack produced the greatest misfor tunes, for it caused a general rising of the Turks on the neighbouring continent, for the purpose of succouring the besieged. To the number of fifty thousand, they hastened to Scio, as though it had been to the chase, crossing at the point of Tschesme, in which they were assisted and protected by the squadron anchored in the channel. Fabvier, being compeUed to raise the siege, rethed, and the inhabitants did not offer any resistance, or even make an attempt to defend themselves against the Turks ; but this submission had no effect in exciting the pity of the ruthless assadants, for almost the whole of the men who fell into theh hands were massacred, and forty thousand women and chUdren were taken to Smyrna, where they were condemned to slavery. The fierce rage of the Turks did not end with these acts of cruelty, for they in other places put to death all whom they succeeded in overpowering. The principal scenes of these horrors were at Smyrna and its environs,"], [254, "192 ASIA MINOR. where the Turks assassinated every Greek they met with, those only escaping who sought safety in conceal ment. In the midst of this disorder and confusion, the Franks were not in any way molested ; a circumstance affording the best proof that in the estimation of the Turks they are held to be deserving of respect and consideration ; and they took advantage of this feeling to save many of the wretched Greeks, whom they purchased and set at liberty. The respect which the Turks now show to the Franks is abject, and even the Greeks, who were formerly humble and oppressed, have lately become imperious to their former masters. I was induced to take an interest in Scio from its ancient celebrity. The circuit of the island is about a hundred and twenty miles ; near the middle there is a lofty mountain, not only uncultivated but even without vegetation. The vaUeys present a striking contrast to this sterility, as mulberry and olive trees, pomegranates, and vines, luxuriantly cover the lower ground, and are very productive. The wine of Scio was not only highly estimated in former times but is considered exquisite in the present day, and still retains the name of nectar. It was the wine of this island that C\u00e6sar drank with his friends, in his triumphs, and at his sacrifices. The population was rich and numerous, but the recent tragical events have nearly ruined and de stroyed it. At the end of the seventeenth century the island was, after a short contest, taken from the Turks, by the Venetians; a few years later, the famous Capudan Pacha, \" Mezzo-Morto,\" gained a complete victory over the latter, at the Spalmadozi islands, and re-cap tured Scio, which at that time contained a very nume-"], [255, "193 SCIO rous population, and possessed 300 churches. But the Catholics were persecuted and almost exterminated by the Turks, on being accused by the schismatic Greeks, who hated them, of having assisted the Vene tians. The fort on the shore, which had been so speedily captured by the Venetians, and which was retaken with equal ease by the Turks, still exists, and this is the work whose defence caused all the late miseries to which I have adverted. Scio formerly produced a large quantity of silk, which, being used in local manufactories, made it rich and prosperous. It also possessed a higher degree of civilization than any other part of the Archipelago, but it has now fallen into a state of utter misery and ruin. The lentisk tree is much cultivated here, for the sake of its mastic, which is reserved exclusively for the women of the Seraglio. The resin forms a particu larly fine varnish, and is obtained in the months of August and September by making deep incisions in the stem of the tree. A considerable number of turpentine trees grow at Scio, and theh produce forms an important article of its exports. Balsams are a source of wealth throughout the East, but the mastic of the lentisk has hitherto been peculiar to this island ; by a careful cultivation, however, it is probable that this tree would flourish in other parts of Asia Minor. The Turkish navy has at various times experienced great disasters on this coast. In 1770, an Ottoman fleet was lying at anchor in the channel, between Scio and the main land, when a Russian force, commanded by Alexis Orloff, appeared in sight ; the Turkish com mander, apprehensive for the safety of his ships, rethed K"], [256, "194 ASIA MINOR. into the roadstead of Tschesme, on that part of the coast of Asia opposite to Scio. This anchorage being of easy access, and at that time without defence, the Turks were at the mercy of the enemy, who, seeing his advantage, sent fireships amongst their fleet. The Ottoman crews not being sufficiently skilful to avert this mode of attack, the whole was destroyed. In 1824, another Turkish fleet having anchored off Scio, \" Canaris,\" notwithstanding the fire directed upon him, attached a fire-ship to the vessel of the Capudan Pacha, and escaped by jumping into a boat : shortly afterwards the flag-ship exploded. Thus a coast, hospitable to foreigners, has been disastrous to its possessors, the Osmanlies. In com bining as weU as in executing projects, they rely solely on destiny, forgetting that the Almighty most com monly assists those who, by calculation, foresight, and courage, merit his protection. Not having stopped at Scio, as originally intended, I proceeded to Scala Nuova, from whence I purposed visiting the ruins of Ephesus. Scala Nuova is a com mercial port, with a smaU town, which is built on the site of the ancient Neapolis; the Greek and Italian names having the same signification. There is a miserable fort at this place, commanded by a Muetzelim, and containing the Turkish popula tion. It is singular that the Jews, who in the East are objects of detestation, should here possess the privi lege of being lodged within the Turkish work, which is denied to every denomination of Christians. Shortly after landing, I proceeded on horseback to the ruins of Ephesus, distant about four leagues from the port. In order to avoid the river Cayster, I took the road along the hiUs, and passed over a waU that"], [257, "EPHESUS. 195 closes the valley, and seems to have been intended as a means of defence. Whatever traveUers may say, Aiasalik cannot be the ancient Ephesus, the site of which is easily discerned. That city, it appears to me, must have stood on the hiU, which forms a gently sloping amphitheatre, sur rounded partly by a waU and partly by perpendicular rocks. It was customary with the Greeks to select such sites for their towns from the facility they afforded for defence. Girgenti, in SicUy (the ancient Agri gentum), is an example of this system. Aiasalik was merely a suburb, and the great importance and wealth of Ephesus justify this opinion of its extent. The city, properly so caUed, was of moderate dimensions, but its dependencies rendered it one of the largest in Asia. The site of the celebrated temple of Diana, which was buUt at the joint expense of nearly all the cities of this peninsula, may, notwithstanding the opinion held by Chandler, be recognized without the shghtest difficulty. The position I am disposed to assign to it corre sponds precisely with the particulars handed down to us by ancient historians ; that is, near the marshes at the foot of the hUl, and opposite to the town. Indeed, the magnitude of the ruins, the fine quahty of the mate rials, and the extent of the subterraneous works, suffi ciently attest that it was on this spot that the most magnificent of Grecian temples formerly stood. Of these beautiful ruins a great part has been removed to ornament various buddings, and particu larly the mosques of Constantinople; such as stdl remain, though mutilated, give an idea of the grandeur of that ancient structure. I observed fragments of K 2"], [258, "196 ASIA MINOR. superb columns of red granite, which unquestionably formed part of the ancient temple; and since there is no quarry of such stone in this part of Asia Minor, they must have been brought from a considerable dis tance. They probably were presented by some of the eastern princes, who vied with each other for the honour of supplying the most admired and precious materials they possessed, for the erection of so proud a monument of their country's glory ; and it is believed that they contributed the whole of the hundred and twenty-seven columns which adorned the temple. The right of sanctuary of the temple of Diana compre hended a space of 125 feet beyond its waUs. The site in question includes ruins to that extent in a compact form, and separated from the city by a paved road. At a short distance beyond the city waUs, the ruins of a smaUer temple are seen, which is presumed to be the one burnt by Eratostratus, on the day of Alexander's birth. For it is known that the new temple was more spacious than the old one, and was built on another site. Opposite the centre of the town, beyond a wide pavement of flat stones, there is a small elevated sanc tuary ; and the bases of sixteen columns, with a stair case leading to the top, are stUl to be seen. It is extraordinary that all traveUers have been sUent re specting these ruins, for they are of so remarkable a character, as naturally to attract attention. In front of the city, in the direction of Scala Nuova, there is a hill at right angles to the amphitheatre within which Ephesus stood; on this eminence are ruins of numerous buildings that apparently were protected by detached fortifications, and formed an extensive suburb on the opposite side of the city to that where Aiasalik"], [259, "197 EPHESUS. is now built : a castle of Grecian construction, bearing the title of St. Paul's prison, occupies the summit. The position of the artificial harbour and canal may be traced; a small muddy pond on the banks of the Cayster having evidently been a part of the former. The maritime establishments of antiquity bore no resemblance to those of the present day. Deep water with elevated and indented coasts are indispensable to afford the necessary havens for the large vessels of modern times ; but the ships of an earher period being adapted for navigating in shadow water, a river empty ing itself into the sea through a sandy beach, presented a suitable position for such a port as they required. This being found, a basin was excavated, and the river deepened so as to form a good communication with the sea, after which entire fleets could obtain shelter in time of need. Works of this kino\" were executed on the coasts of La Manche, at Boulogne and Etaples, in 1804, when Napoleon, having projected the expedition to England, assembled a large flotiUa for that purpose. The vaUey of the Cayster possessed all the requisites for an ancient harbour, and we can readily imagine that the naval arsenals, storehouses, and commercial estabbsh ments of this great city were placed there. The ruins on the banks of the river, and near its mouth prove that Ephesus extended nearly to the sea. It is probable that this, being the richest part of the city, was the first destroyed by the disasters consequent on the wars and revolutions of that epoch. The frequent plundering, and various other misfortunes that suc ceeded the destruction of the temple by Constantine, drove the population to the quarter that had the least"], [260, "198 ASIA MINOR. suffered. The maritime district was, therefore, de serted, the palaces were abandoned, and from theh ruins, smaU houses were built in the more distant suburbs; these also were subsequently destroyed, leaving but slight traces of theh having ever existed. An aqueduct, built at the period of the lower Emphe, for the purpose of supplying Ephesus with water, is stUl in a state of preservation. The new town took its name from a Greek church dedicated to St. John ; Aiasalik, the designation of the present wretched village, being merely a corruption of Agios-Theologos, or Holy Theologian. The Greek church afterwards became a mosque, and the mosque, in its turn, a ruin. One of the emperors built a fort for the protection of the city, but that also has been abandoned. Thus Aiasalik was first a suburb of Ephesus, then a city of the Greeks, and lastly, falhng into the hands of the Turks, has dwindled into insignificance, hke every other place that has been compeUed to submit to Ottoman rule. Ephesus was one of the first cities that received Christianity. St. John and St. Paul there preached the gospel, and the former, becoming a resident, was its first bishop, and closed his life within its walls. At a period of remote antiquity, Ephesus, hke all the cities of Asia, underwent great changes. It is said to have been built by an Amazon, from whom it took its name : it was colonized by the Ionians, and its inhabitants were engaged in the wars between the Athenians and Lacedemonians, as aUies of the latter. Alexander re-established the democracy, and pro posed to defray the expense of rebuilding the temple, provided the Ephesians would place upon it an in-"], [261, "199 EPHESUS. scription recording the name of the benefactor; but they declined the offer, aUeging as a reason, that it was unsuitable for one deity to rear a temple to another. The city was under the rule of Antigonus and Lysi machus; Hannibal went there to concert measures with Antiochus ; at a later period, every Roman found iu the place was put to death by order of Mithri dates. It afterwards became the seat of government of a proconsul and was visited by the most Ulustrious Romans ; had a temple erected by Augustus in honour of Julius C\u00e6sar and of Rome ; was extended by Tibe rius ; pillaged by the Persians, and had its temple destroyed by order of Constantine. The Greeks of the lower Empire defended it, with various success, against the Mussulmans; at length however the city was captured by Mahomet the first, and since that period has remained uninterruptedly in possession of the Turks; but its commerce failed and was transferred to Smyrna, and a few years afterwards Ephesus ceased to exist. There is a probabdity that its destruction was hast ened by its wealth and beauty, which exciting, without the power of satisfying, the avarice of the barbarians, merely served to feed their rapacity for a time. Much of its materials were removed to Constantinople, and its ruins alone are left to remind the traveUer of har bours, arsenals, palaces, and temples ; in short, of the accumulated treasures of one of the richest, most beautiful, and most populous cities hi the world. The high ground overlooking Ephesus is arid and rocky, like all the lofty hills and mountains of Asia Minor ; but the valley is fertile, and on its margin olive-trees thrive uncultivated, yielding an abundance of fruit, which there is no one to gather."], [262, "200 ASIA MINOR. On returning from Ephesus we followed the right bank of the Cayster to its mouth, where we found some poor fishermen dragging on a miserable existence. We forded the river, and at a late hour entered Scala Nuova. Throughout the whole of the day we had seen nothing but ruins and other inanimate objects, with the exception of three or four wretched and half clothed inhabitants of Aiasalik, and the fishermen already mentioned. On the 21st of August, we set sail for the island of Samos, passing through the narrow strait that separates it from the coast of Mycale, where in former times the deputies of the Ionian conference assembled. We anchored in the harbour of Colonni, the nearest port to tbe ancient city of Samos. Herodotus and Pausanias state, that on this shore there formerly was one of the largest temples of Greece, and that it was dedicated to Juno. A single column only of this vast edifice is now standing ; its module is nearly seven feet, and it is of white marble, pro bably taken from one of the surrounding rocks or hUls, which are entirely composed of this beautiful material. Amongst the ruins there are the bases of other co lumns, but the most valuable parts of the old structure have either been removed or covered by sand. In the fields there are many remains of ancient buildings, and we were informed that, about two years back, part of a beautiful temple, with fluted columns, was discovered. The island of Samos was once of great importance, having been the first place, in this part of the world, whose inhabitants extensively promoted navigation, or possessed fleets. There belonged to Samos a hundred war vessels, each carrying fifty rowers, and armed with"], [263, "SAMOS. 201 archers, and these were employed in the contests between the Athenians and Lacedemonians. Poly crates, one of the kings of Samos was renowned for the immensity of his wealth, and the unchequered hap piness that accompanied it, for a series of years ; but at length his life was brought to a miserable close by assassination. This island was indebted for much of its celebrity to its impregnable fortifications ; \u2014 to the famous temple dedicated to Juno, aheady mentioned ; \u2014 to the stupendous works for supplying the inha bitants with water ; and to the great extent of the town, of which a tolerably accurate idea can stiU be formed, by observing the space that is covered by its ruins. The population, which in former times must have been very considerable, does not now exceed twenty thousand souls, and yet all the islands of this Archipelago have had great privUeges ; have been pro tected by municipal institutions; and have in conse quence been guaranteed from a part of those desolating exactions which bring ruin on the subjects of the Otto man emphe ; the mere presence of the Turks, however, entaUs destruction.* Pythagoras was born at Samos ; and it was at Patmos, near that island, that St. John the Evangelist wrote the Apocalypse. Samos is famous for the wine and raisins produced from the muscatel grape. ExceUent water may be obtained on the coast by merely digging in the sand to a slight depth. * In the note to pages 131-132, it has been already stated that Samos enjoys the special protection of the Sultan, and that its institutions are wisely directed by its governor, who is a Christian Prince. Therefore, such sweeping condemnation as that in the text should not be received without some degree of caution and inquiry. (TV) K 3"], [264, "202 ASIA MINOR. Water may also be procured on otber shores by the same process, but it is unusual to find it, under such circumstances, sufficiently free from saline matter to be suited for the supply of shipping or general use, as it is at Samos. On quitting Samos we had a favourable wind, whicb speedily carried us to the opposite coast, and we an chored in a bay not far from the spot where a very celebrated temple of Apollo once stood, on the banks of the M\u00e6ander. It belonged to the ancient city of Miletus, in the district of Caria, the birthplace of many famous philosophers, and in those days one of the most important and powerful places of the Ionian people, having extensive commerce and numerous colonies. Even after falling under the Ottoman yoke, it for a while retained its celebrity, but nothing now remains of it save a mass of ruins, scattered over a considerable surface of land. This locality presents a striking instance of the won derful changes effected by the operations of nature. Miletus was once a sea-port, and in the days of Strabo had four harbours, one of which was very spacious and was sheltered by a group of islands. The sea is now at a considerable distance from the site of the ancient city, for immense masses of alluvial matter brought by the M\u00e6ander, have formed a new tract of country, the future extent of wliich cannot be estimated, as there is a daily accumulation of these deposits. It is in short another Delta, which, though at present unproductive, from the want of population, may hereafter prove an abundant source of wealth, if well directed efforts are employed to turn this gift of nature to advantage. The ground is covered with ruins, but none of them merit the traveUer's notice, excepting those of the"], [265, "MILETUS. 203 temple, the materials of which are in such admirable preservation, that we might imagine either that an earthquake of only yesterday had overturned thc struc ture, or that the work of demolition had been under taken by the hands of man, according to some regular and weU-concerted plan. It is known that Constantine, in the barbarous exer cise of his zeal for the Christian religion, ordered the destruction of all pagan temples, instead of consecrating them to the worship of the one true God; the deso lation of Asia must not therefore be attributed to time alone. Of this temple three columns only, which are visible from a considerable distance at sea, have escaped that devastating zeal. Most of the materials originaUy used in the con struction of the temple, remain upon the spot, and I believe that if it were required to restore the budding to its former state, but httle\" would be found deficient. The elegance and beauty of the several parts, and more especiaUy of the sculptured marble, are very remark able ; but I find it impossible to give an adequate idea of the impression produced upon me, by contemplating such an enormous mass of ruins, accumulated on so smaU a space. This stupendous pile of stones gave me the idea of an immense and magnificent quarry of white marble, whose blocks have been recently shaped and polished, for they have as much the appearance of freshness as if they had been the work of only yesterday. The temple was of the Ionic order, and the ornaments, which are beautiful, must have been executed by a masterly hand, and with a most dehcate chisel. Its columns were fluted, and six feet in diameter, and the plinths"], [266, "204 ASIA MINOR. of thirteen of them are still visible, but the rest are hidden by the ruins. I measured an architrave, and found it to be eighteen feet long, three feet thick, and four feet high. Many valuable treasures of the fine arts may be col lected here, and they merit the study and research of the learned and inquiring traveUer. About a hundred peasants residing in huts amongst the ruins, present the only signs of life in this desolate and dreary scene. They deal in coins, without however having any just idea of their value ; but the chief employment of these poor people is in the cultivation of the cotton plant. They supplied us with good horses to return to the sea side. On re-embarking, we pro ceeded on our voyage, sailing in sight of the island of Cos, the country of Hippocrates, a man whose entire life was passed in assuaging the sufferings of humanity, and in scientific researches that carried him far beyond the sphere of knowledge of the age in which he lived, and would have rendered his name illustrious even in the present day. We also saw that part of the coast near the site of Cnidus, on which a temple, dedicated to Venus, and of great celebrity, formerly stood ; some of its ruins are still extant, but not having time to devote to theh inspection, we continued our course, and on the 24th of August anchored off the island of Rhodes. Early in the morning of the 25th I disembarked, and entered the city with a feeling of deep emotion, being reminded of the important services rendered by the Knights of St. John to humanity, civilization, and reb gion ; for by their exertions this place became the ram part of Europe, and kept in check the barbarian force which threatened the fairest countries of Christendom."], [267, "205 RHODES. The renown the knights acquired in the cause of reli gion, was honourable to the whole of Europe, and especially to France, for the greater number both of the knights and grand masters, whose names have been handed down to us as the most distinguished, were of that country. Three hundred and fifteen years have now elapsed since this Ulustrious order was obliged to abandon its conquests, after a possession of two hundred and twelve years. The Street of the Knights is uninjured, and the door of each house is stiU ornamented with the escut cheon of its last inhabitant. The buildings have been spared, but are unoccupied, and we could almost fancy ourselves surrounded by the shades of departed heroes. The arms of France, the noble flcurs- de-hs, are seen in all directions. I observed those of the Clermont-Ton nerres, and of other ancient and illustrious famihes. Rhodes was caUed by the Greeks \" Ophiusa,\" or the Island of Serpents, on account of the number of those reptiles with which it was infested. The present name is said to have been given in consequence of the abund ance of roses the island produces. It is extremely fertile, well cultivated, and plentifully supplied with water, an advantage that few of the neighbouring islands possess. Its circumference is about forty leagues. In the time of tbe Greek Empire the popula tion of Rhodes amounted to fifteen hundred thousand, and a powerful navy rendered her mistress of the sur rounding seas. Her commerce was extensive, and she was celebrated for having superior manufactures and excellent dyes. The arts were successfully cultivated at Rhodes, and it is asserted that there were three thou sand statues erected here, in honour of heroes and of the gods. The Colossus, dedicated to the Sun, the"], [268, "206 ASIA MINOR. titular divinity of the island, was of superb workmanship, and according to Pliny, measured seventy cubits in height. There are two rocks, level with the surface of the water, which evidently supported this statue. The Rhodians were not only agriculturists, manu facturers, artists, and sailors, but also distinguished warriors ; and sustained, in the time of the Romans, a siege memorable for its obstinacy, and for the brilliant actions of the soldiers. The noble defence by the Knights, at a more recent period, was equally renowned. This island was conquered by the Caliphs, and subse quently re- annexed to the Greek empire. The Vene tians estabbshed themselves there in 1203, but were soon dislodged by John Ducas. After which, some revolted Greeks having joined a band of Saracens, cap tured all the defences excepting a single fort, which, remaining in possession of the Greek Emperor Andro nicus, preserved to him at least a shadow of power. Such was the state of affairs when Foulques de VU laret, Grand Master of the order of St. John, having been expelled from the Holy Land and Syria, and taken refuge at Cyprus, determined to achieve the conquest of Rhodes, and establish the authority of religion in that island. Assisted by Pope Nicholas IV., by Philip le Bel, king of France, and by a host of Crusaders, who were induced by the Pope to join him, he landed with his united forces, in the year 1308. After repeated battles in front of the fortress, its siege was commenced, and on the 23rd of August, 1310, it surrendered. At a later period the whole of the island, as weU as some smaller islands near it, submitted to his power. The order of St. John thus established, with its terri tories, revenues, and naval force, resisted, for a period of two hundred years, the efforts of the Turks, who"], [269, "207 RHODES. during that time pursued their course of continental success ; but, on their becoming masters of the whole of the Greek Emphe, they resolved on destroying enemies who were dangerous froni theh proximity, their courage, and theh perseverance. The first siege was undertaken, but without success, in 1480, in the reign of Mahomet II. , the Sultan who had conquered Constantinople, and raised the glory of the Ottoman Empire to its greatest height. The cele brated defence by Pierre D'Aubuisson, the Grand Master, immortalised him. In 1520 Solyman II. determined to renew the attempt, and he did not consider it beneath his dignity to conduct the attack in person. He assembled an army, wliich it is said amounted to one hundred thou sand of his best troops, \u2014 a numerous fleet conveyed this force to the island, and he captured the fortress after a siege of nearly six months' duration. Obstinate as this resistance may appear, and highly as it has been ex tolled, I cannot help feeling, after a careful study of all the circumstances of the case, that it might have been prolonged. In order to ascertain the real merits of the sieges of antiquity, we should not contrast them with those of modern times, but bear in mind the means that were re spectively at the disposal of the assaUants and defenders. This would enable us to form a proper estimate of their courage, skiU, and perseverance. When arrows were the only weapons of offence, a simple wall sufficed for an indefinite resistance; but, according to the present system of attack, aided by the great improvement that has taken place in artiUery during the last twenty-four years, a modern fortress, though constructed with the greatest care and science, cannot hold out beyond a"], [270, "208 ASIA MINOR. certain time, that can be almost fixed by calculation; and it wiU be found in the next war, that the defence of fortified places wiU be considerably shortened. If we bear in mind that, some few centuries ago, the art of gunnery was in its infancy; that everything connected with its use presented difficulties, and that its effects were uncertain, we shall perceive the causes of the protracted sieges that so much astonish us, and which in the existing state of military science, would be utterly impossible. We may fairly then ascribe the long defence of Rhodes, to the defective system of attack. The fortress is on one side exposed to a very close command, but the works are there multiplied to such a degree, as almost to counterbalance this disadvantage of position, and therefore the Turks were not wrong in seeking elsewhere for a point against which to dhect their efforts. But instead of choosing the \" sahent \" in the middle of the \" enceinte,\" whicli from being unsup ported and from the nature of the intervening ground, could have been easily approached and promptly des troyed, they attacked a part fortified on a straight line, and possessing powerful means of defence. The breaches were much less extensive than historians assert them to have been, for the repairs whicb distin guish the new from the old portions of the waUs, afford good evidence of the amount of injury the fortress sus tained. Without wishing however to detract from the merit of an honourable and even a glorious defence, I must observe, that I think it could have been prolonged. For in the first place the besiegers had not obtained possession of the quarter now occupied by the Jews and Turks; then there was an interior line, surrounding"], [271, "209 RHODES. what is called the Knights' Town, wliich had not been injured, and there was besides the palace of the Grand Master, forming an additional defence, aU of which were capable of further resistance. We were unable to discover from what point the fort of Saint Nicholas, standing out as it does in the sea, could, with any degree of advantage, have been battered by the Turks, or bow it was possible for them to carry on the attack of that work as mentioned in the records of the siege ; for the fire upon it must have been with out utdity, and in fact without an object. It is evident that the inj ury done to the fortress by the artiUery, was not so great as has been stated. In these times, sixty pieces of ordnance would produce a greater effect in ten days' firing, and it may be asserted that, with the ex ception of two breaches of moderate dimensions, those parts of the enclosure that were damaged, had not been rendered the less defensible. Histoiians assign the deficiency of powder as the proximate cause of the capitulation, and if this state ment were true, there would have been a very sufficient reason for the surrender. This, however, appears to have been a mere pretext, for a few years since, a sub terraneous magazine was discovered, in which were found twenty thousand pounds of powder, that must have been there at the period of this memorable siege. We may therefore conclude that there is great exagge ration in the accounts handed down to us of this defence. The hasty survey I took of the environs of the city of Rhodes, was sufficient to shew me the miserable con dition into which this island has fallen. As before stated, it formerly contained a million and a half of inhabitants ; at the time of the Knights, these were not"], [272, "210 ASIA MINOR. more than three hundred and sixty thousand : and now the number, including aU ages, sexes, and denomina tions, is reduced to twenty-eight thousand souls. Pro perty has become almost valueless, for I saw a handsome country-house in good repair, with a garden of fifty acres in extent, containing upwards of three thousand orange and lemon trees, that had been sold a short time before my visit, for the small sum of three thousand five hundred francs. I went to the sponge fishery, which is curious and interesting. It is a laborious and dangerous employ ment, but so lucrative, that five or six successful days afford those engaged in it the means of support for an entire year. The sponge is attached to rocks at the bottom of the sea, serving as a retreat to myriads of small crustaceous animals, which occupy its cavities. The fishermen dive for it to the depth of even a hundred feet, and sometimes continue for five or six minutes under water, unless the quantity of sponge they may have collected becomes inconvenient or unmanageable, when they are hauled to the surface, by the crew of the boat to which they belong. The divers occasionaUy faU victims to sharks that attack them under water. The sponge is prepared for the market by being pressed to dislodge the animalcul\u00e6 it contains, and afterwards washed in lye to deprive it of mucdaginous matter. On the 26th of August we again got under way, and directed our course towards Syria. I was desirous of anchoring in the Gulf of Makri, one of the finest road steads on this coast, and of remaining at Satalia, to visit the southern shore of Asia Minor, whicb is rich in antiquities ; but the short time I had to spare, and other circumstances connected with the voyage, not"], [273, "BEYROUT. 211 admitting of this delay, we continued om* course to wards Beyrout, where we arrived on the evening of the 29th. This place stands on the site of the ancient Berytus, a colony of Sidon, founded at a period of remote antiquity. Berytus became a Roman colony under Augustus, taking the name of \" Fehx Julia,\" from his daughter, and was one of the most beautiful cities of Ph\u0153nicia. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 566, and on being rebuilt, the Saracens, after an obstinate siege, took possession of it. The city was recaptured by Baldwin, King of Jeru salem, was afterwards taken from the Christians by Saladin, and subsequently it several times changed masters, according to the success of the Crusaders or theh enemies. It became eventually the residence of the Emir Fakh-el-Din, Prince of the Druses, who was killed there, when ineffectuaUy attempting to defend his country against Sultan Amurath IV., and from that period Beyrout has remained a part of the Otto man Empire. The Emir Fakh-el-Din having resided at the court of Florence, and brought from thence a taste for the fine arts, built a magnificent palace of which some vestiges are stiU to be seen. The forest of pines, near the city, whicb now affords to the inhabitants an agree able and shaded promenade, was planted by him. The open roadstead of Beyrout partakes of the prevailing character of the Syrian coast, in offering but an inse cure shelter to shipping ; but a short mole forms a place of safety for vessels of small tonnage. Larger ships anchor at about a league distance, at the mouth of the Nahr-el-Beyrout, the \" Magoras \" of the ancients, a river that rises in Libanus."], [274, "212 ASIA MINOR. Beyrout has a population of between eight and ten thousand persons, and may be considered as the port of Damascus, which is the entrepot of commerce between Em-ope and Asia. The annual value of the exports and imports of Beyrout is between four and five mdhons of francs. The manufacture of glass is said to have been invented here. I found the European consuls, especially those of France and Austria, M. Guis and M. Loretta, most anxious to shew me attention. This was the first spot I had visited under the domi nion of Mehemet Ah, and prepossessed as I had been in favour of his great and surprising works, I was painfully disappointed at observing his unpopularity, and that his administration was the subject of bitter complaint. In fact, a great change had taken place in the opinion entertained of him since the establishment of his power, in consequence of his having tried to extend to Syria a system of monopoly that is only applicable to Egypt, where it is favoured by the pecu liar character of the inhabitants, and the configuration of the country. The sdk gathered in Libanus constitutes the wealth of the population of that district, and Mehemet Ah was deshous of taking possession of it, but the attempt caused so much discontent, that he was obhged to rescind his order. The revolt which broke out in the neighbourhood of Naplous and Jerusalem, raised the hopes and con fidence of his enemies, and gave an opportunity for the expression of the complaints that all felt justified in making against him ; iu short, the Egyptian rule, which was at first wiUingly submitted to, became detested ; and the Sultan, so little respected nearer"], [275, "213 BEYROUT. home, and so iU obeyed in the provinces under his immediate Government, regained a sort of popularity with those who, three years previously, had rejoiced in witnessing the destruction of his power ; thus affording a fresh example of the truth so often demonstrated in history, that the love evinced for monarchs, is fre quently rather an expression of hatred for their rivals. But intending to describe hereafter the system of government and administration of Mehemet Ali, I shaU not at present give any details on this subject, as I merely wish to state my first impressions on entering the provinces under his control. The country rn the environs of Beyrout is well culti vated, and covered with fig and mulberry trees ; the latter being in a dwarf state, for the reasons I have aheady assigned. Beyrout is threatened with a terrible catastrophe through the accumulation of a very minute sand, which is gradually advancing towards it from the south. Detached houses and even trees are buried under this sand within a few months of its first reaching them, and as no effort is made to arrest this evil, there cannot be a doubt of its eventually overwhelming the whole town. Its annual progress for some time past having been at the rate of about thirty yards, a tolerably accurate calculation might be made of the period when this place will cease to exist, and yet the inhabitants seem to be regardless of their impending fate, and enjoy the present without ever bestowing a thought upon the future ; but to foreigners this visita tion affords a subject for sad reflection. Purposing to inspect the country of the Druses and the Maronites, and to ascend Mount Sannin, one of the loftiest points of Libanus, I made the necessary"], [276, "214 STRIA, arrangements for my journey thither. I was also desirous of seeing the city of Damascus, and the ruins of Baalbeck ; of traversing Syria, and of visiting the Holy Land. The chain of Libanus, which commences opposite to Tripoli, and ends near Saida, the ancient Sidon, lies pa raUel to the coast : its highest point does not exceed an elevation of 1300 toises (7480 English feet) . The cedars mentioned in Scripture as having adorned this chain, and which supplied the timber for the construction of Solomon's Temple, as well as for the building of the fleets of Tyre and Sidon, have disappeared ; seven trees alone remaining as memorials of what were once so majestic and so beautiful. These mountains having lost their primitive covering, nothing but naked and arid rocks present themselves in aU directions to the traveUer's eye. An active, intelligent, and industrious population has however come to inhabit and restore fertility to this district. Clumps of. pines have been planted near the monasteries and villages, and every interval between the rocks is appropriated to the culti vation of corn, the vine, or the mulberry-tree. Where the spaces are too confined to admit of using the plough, the ground is worked with hoes, and it is abun dantly hrigated by springs, which also supply sufficient water for domestic purposes. But before entering on a description of the country, it will be proper to say a few words respecting its inhabitants, and in doing so I shaU record not only my own opinions, but give the observations of those authors who have made the fullest and most careful inquiries into this subject. The population of Libanus does not exceed four hundred thousand souls. It is Composed of three distinct races : the Ansaries, the Druses, and the"], [277, "215 LIBANUS. Maronites. The first occupy the northern and much the smaUer portion of this district, in the environs of Tripoli, and the two last inhabit the southern part. The Ansaries comprise about sixty thousand of both sexes. As neither the truths of the Gospel, nor the precepts of the Koran, have made much impression upon them, theh religious ceremonies are extraordinary and inconsistent, for they bave adopted forms of wor ship both from Christians and Mahometans, although they still continue idolators, some worshipping the sun and the remainder the dog-star. As, however, I have not myself seen anything of this people, and as they are of little importance, I shaU offer no further obser vations upon them. Although the Druses and the Maronites differ in creed, they have common interests, are under the same government, are equaUy civilised, hospitable, and indus trious. The Maronites came from the banks of the Orontes. At the end of the 16th century, a hermit, named Maronne, acquhed by his predictions and austere life, great influence over the inhabitants of the district in which he hved. Religious quarrels had broken out between the churches of Rome and Constantinople, and Maronne, having declared himself an advocate of the doctrines of the former, was oppressed and perse cuted by the authorities at Constantinople, and com pelled with his foUowers to rethe into the mountains of Libanus. The Druses derive their origin from the same part of the world. Initiated in Islamism, they took part in the discussions respecting the legitimacy of the Caliph ; but, at a later period, many false prophets having appeared among them, they were subdivided into"], [278, "216 SYRIA, various sects. They then mixed their new dogmas with the precepts of theh original faith, wliich pro duced the greatest confusion, and they became believers in the doctrines of the metempsychosis, and of a second life commencing six thousand years after death. The civU anarchy which prevailed at that time rendered the religious dissensions the more inveterate. The third Caliph of the Fatimite race caused a fresh schism, by insisting on being recognised as the incarnate God. He reheved his followers from the obligation of prayer, and the performance of the religious duties required by the Koran. Mahomed ben-Ismael having preached this doctrine, it spread in various parts of the east, especially in Syria, and its progress was neither arrested by the death of the Caliph, nor by that of his prophet. The Druses, persecuted in consequence of theh creed, took refuge in the mountains of Libanus, and lived in perfect harmony with the Maronites, who had previously found an asylum there. They both preserved their independence during many centuries, repulsing the Turks, who made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to subdue them. At length Amurath III. displeased at the disturbances they caused, ordered Ibrahim, the Pacha of Cairo, to bring them into subjection. He accordingly col lected a considerable force, took possession of the country, and imposed a tribute upon them. A chief selected by themselves, from one of their most distinguished families, was appointed to be theh ruler, and his authority alone sufficed to repress anarchy, maintain order, and increase the importance of the people. Fakh-el-Din, who fiUed this supreme office, added"], [279, "217 LIBANUS. essentially to the power with which he was invested, by his address, and the support he contrived to obtain at the Court of the Sultan. Driving the Aga from Beyrout, he took possession of that city, and was pardoned for the outrage, in consequence of a voluntary augmentation of the tribute he had been accustomed to pay to the Grand Signior. He acted in the same manner on other points, and increased his territory by the acquisition of the cities of Saida, Soor, and Baalbeck ; but his enemies having become formidable, he found it expedient to pacify them by abdicating in favour of his son. After a long residence at the court of the Medici, where he acquired a knowledge of the fine arts, he returned to Syria and resumed the government. Sultan Amurath, however, becoming jealous of his power and celebrity, ordered the Pacha of Damascus to subdue the Fakir, who after a resistance of many years, was defeated, captured, and put to death. His descendants succeeded him in authority over the Maronites and Druses, but on the extinction of theh race, the Sultan delegated his authority to the Ulustrious Arab famdy of \"Shehab,\" whose origin is traced by some to Bagdad and by others to the neighbourhood of Damascus. It is very nume rous, comprising as many as two hundred and fifty Emirs. On the demise of the Emir charged with the govern ment of this nation, his successor is selected by the Sultan from among the members of this famdy. Emh Beschir, the present chief of the Druses, has been theh ruler during the last forty years. When the French army marched into Syria, after the conquest of Egypt, he would unquestionably have joined us, L"], [280, "218 SYRIA if the formidable Djezzar Pacha had yielded and we had been successful at St. Jean d'Acre. Through aU the changes that have taken place, the Maronites have continued to be zealous Catholics. The Court of Rome has granted various privdeges to the clergy of this country, and modified the discipline of their church. The priests are permitted to marry ; divine service is performed in the Syrian language; and the Patriarch, who resides at Libanus, is selected by the Bishops and confirmed by the Pope. His Holiness sends the \" Pallium \" as a token of his appro bation. There are eight dioceses, and the powers of the Patriarch are extensive. Owing to their confused notions on religious matters, and the uncertainty resulting from the diversity of creeds in which they have been instructed, the Druses have not estabbshed any complete system of worship, but seem to have adopted a mixture of the rites of various persuasions. They attend the service of the Church as well as of the Mosque, going to the former if living with Christians, and to the latter when amongst Mahometans; at least such is the custom of the greater number. They are, however, subdivided into two classes, the uninstructed and the initiated, the former being the more numerous. The smaUer body meet in secret, and have ceremonies whicb are but imperfectly known. The initiation is difficult, and attended with great formalities. It is understood that at their private meetings they adore a smaU statue, representing a calf. This is indicative of a Jewish, or rather an Egyptian origin, and would lead us to suppose that their idolatry was derived from the worship of Apis. They have a ritual which is said to be fiUed with a mystic jargon, adverting to the pretended ten"], [281, "219 LIBANUS. times renewed incarnation of the Divinity, but this book is only in the possession of a few persons. Emir Beschir has been converted to Christianity, and openly foUows its forms of worship. The administration of the country is conducted by the Emirs and Sheiks. The Great Prince levies the tax, which by ancient custom and general consent is fixed at a certain rate for each acre of land, or accord ing to the number of mulberry trees. Out of the sum so coUected he pays the tribute due to the Government, retaining the residue, which constitutes the greater part of his income ; for although the private fortune of the Shehabs was originaUy very considerable, it is much reduced by the drain upon it, caused by the great increase in their number. Emir Beschir resides at Deir-el-Kamar, in a hand some budding, on the western side of Mount Libanus, towards the Mediterranean. The population is com peUed to take up arms by his order and to act under his command. The arrangements of the government are also carried into effect through his medium, and the administrative and judicial functions in a great degree devolve upon him. He is not only feared and respected, but is considered just and humane ; two traits, however, which I am about to relate, will shew how such a reputation may be acquired among the Druses. Twenty years since, the Emh having been successful in a contest for power with two of his nephews, he caused their eyes to be put out. At a more recent period two of his cousins conspired against him, and theh plot having been discovered, they promised fidelity for the future, on receiving the Emir's forgiveness, adding that if they failed to redeem theh pledge, they L 2"], [282, "220 SYRIA. would consent to be deprived of sight and the power of speech. Some little time after, their treachery was renewed, and on its detection, they were arrested. Emir Beschir having asked them what fate they had intended for him, in the event of their success : they answered \"Death.\" He then said he should be satisfied with the infliction of the punishment stipulated by the con- ditions of the pardon he had extended to them on the discovery of their former conspiracy, and immediately the razor was applied to their tongues and the red hot hon to their eyes. One of them was a Christian and the other a Mahometan. The former is now both blind and speechless, but the latter retains the power of vision, although in a very imperfect degree, and can stiU speak intelligibly. The Emir's treatment of these relatives is here re garded as an act of clemency ! It was my intention to form an acquaintance with this chief, by visiting him at Deir-el-Kamar, but I found he had set out to command the force coUected for the purpose of suppressing the insurrections at Naplous and Jerusalem. I subsequently learnt that he succeeded not only in tbis undertaking, but also in maintaining the tran quillity of the greater part of Syria. Emir Beschir cannot fail to perceive that should the Sultan, or the Turks of Constantinople ever regain their ascendency in Syria, they would wreak theh vengeance on the Christian population of Libanus. He is therefore deeply interested in preventing such a change, and should Mehemet Ali govern this people with justice and address, he may fairly calculate upon having the assistance of theh chief."], [283, "LIBANUS. 221 Formerly unanimity prevailed among the members of the Shehab famdy, who were obedient to the Chief selected by the Sultan; but Djezzar Pacha, being desirous of weakening their power, has excited the ambition and fomented the discontent of such of them as have any pretensions to the dignity of Great Prince, and has thus succeeded in producing dissensions and conspiracies similar to those which caused the acts of severity above described. On the 1st of September I set out on my journey to Libanus, Baalbeck, and Damascus. My caravan was composed of twenty-three horses, thirteen of which were required for carrying our bag gage. I had three tents \u2022 one for myself, another for my companions, and the third for the servants, con sisting of my French establishment and a certain number of Arab attendants, hired for the occasion. We were amply provided witb the utensds necessary for the excursion, and our daUy practice was to pitch our tents near a spring, adopting throughout this journey a style of living that constantly reminded me of my early campaigning days, which were the happiest of my life. My feUow travellers were Count Brazza, Mr. Burn, a young Englishman, with whom I became acquainted at Odessa; and M. Lorella, the son of the Austrian Consul at Beyrout, besides a good interpreter. We traveUed during the first hour over a very fertile and carefully cultivated tract of country. Before reaching the river Beyrout (the ancient Magoras) we passed the spot where, according to popular tradition, St. George overcame the dragon. The inhabitants still givecredence tothestory,and pointto somereddish marks upon a rock, as stains produced by the dragon's blood."], [284, "222 SYRIA, At a short distance from the mouth of the river we observed the Delaware, a fine American ship of war, lying at anchor. After crossing the stream we ascended the hills, on its right bank, by one of those narrow and difficult passes that constitute the strength and security of Libanus. In my journey through this arid district, I was much astonished at the extraordinary skill and industry dis played by its cultivators, which I have never seen surpassed. Not only the smaUest patches of ground enclosed by rocks, but even the largest fields, are worked with a degree of labour and care that is rarely bestowed excepting upon a highly cultivated garden. In situations where, owing to the natural declivity, the soil is exposed to be washed away by heavy rain, it is secured by being raised to a level surface and supported by walls ; in short, the greatest attention and dihgence are unremittingly employed to increase the produc tiveness of this country. The great profit obtained by the rearing of the silk-worm, causes the mulberry-tree to be the principal object of culture. Having left Beyrout at rather a late hour, we could not, on our first day's journey, accomplish more than four leagues, and we therefore pitched our tents at about that distance from the city, near the viUage of Doura, which is inhabited by Druses. We found these people obliging and hospitable; qualities which we were led to expect from their benevolent countenances. Setting out at daylight, on the following morning, we reached the convent of Marmousset in the forenoon. Its situation is highly picturesque, there being on one side precipitous rocks, and on the other an extensive wood of firs, surrounded by productive fields which are embeUished with numerous fountains."], [285, "LIBANUS. 223 On presenting ourselves at the Convent, to solicit the hospitality of the Monks, we met with a cold reception, amounting almost to a repulse. We could not at first account for this unexpected incivdity, but we were subsequently informed that we were supposed to be Enghsh, as nine out of every ten traveUers in Syria are of that nation, and it appears that the ardent spirit of proselytism of which they are accused makes them objects of aversion to the holy fathers; but on my stating that we were Cathohcs and Frenchmen, we were received with transports of joy. Great efforts were in consequence made to provide a repast for us, which, seasoned as it was by hunger, we found deli cious; although its frugality afforded proof of the austere life of these pious men, and of luxuries being unknown amongst them. They attend the various services of the Church seven times during the twenty-four hours, devoting even a part of the night to prayer; the remainder of their time is occupied by labour in the fields, the produce of which is applied to charitable purposes. Indeed it may be truly said that they possess the virtues of the early Christians. In theh ceUs there is not a single trace of comfort, and they have only one frugal meal a day. Prayer and labour form theh sole employment, and their exemplary hves make them objects of esteem and reverence to those who have chosen them for their sphitual teachers. The care bestowed on the cultivation of the land, the gentle manners of the people, and the peace which reigns amongst them, are chiefly owing to the precepts and example of these holy men. The Maronites have fifty-nine religious establish ments formed on a modification of the rides of St. Anthony, and divided into three classes."], [286, "224 SYRIA The first is composed of thirty-two convents, called \" Lebanies,\" which are partly dedicated to the educa tion of youth. The monks have also the sphitual care of three parishes, and the direction of eight alms houses, which are very smaU houses intended for the reception of the sick and poor of theh flocks. Each is inhabited by a single monk. The second class consists of four convents, distin guished by the name of \"Alepine,\" and possessing two almshouses. The thhd has four of these buddings, and sixteen convents ; there are also four convents of a still more austere order, and fourteen nunneries of various denominations. After a long and fatiguing journey, I arrived in the afternoon at the foot of the peak which bears the name of \" Sannin.\" On reaching its summit, I found, by the process adopted in measuring Olympus, that the height of this mountain is 2525 metres (2761 Enghsh yards) . We encamped on the table land at the bottom of the peak, which is 1519 metres (1661 Enghsh yards) above the level of the sea, and we there found a spring whose temperature was ascertained to be seven degrees.* The operation I performed both at Sannin and Brusa confirms the received opinion that heat dimi nishes in the proportion of one degree \" centigrade \" for every hundred toises of elevation, f It has been erroneously stated that the top of Mount Sannin is perpetuaUy covered with snow, for, during the summer it is only in some of the hoUows, which are entirely screened from the sun's rays, that any is to be found.

On the 3rd of September, we set out for Baalbeck, and after crossing the ridge of Libanus, we continued our course on its eastern side, which in appearance is the very reverse of that we ascended, for it is impossible to conceive a more parched, desolate, and sterile country. There is not a spring, nor even a drop of water, to be found upon its surface. Nothing is to be seen but rugged rocks of dazzling whiteness, reflecting the rays of a scorching sun. We passed just above Rachne, a viUage situated at the foot of the mountain, and which in this almost desert land is of some impor tance, being the residence of a bishop, who is as poor as were those of the primitive church ! The two sides of this mountain present a complete contrast to each other ; on the western, there are copious springs, a fertile soU, and a numerous population, whose industry and skdl in agriculture appear to have acquired for them a moderate degree of wealth; but on the eastern, with the exception of a few oaks, affording some faint signs of vegetation, all is barrenness. I per ceived the dross of forges, at which I was much asto nished, as it proved that at some remote period there must have been iron works on this spot ; and the fol lowing inquiries naturally suggested themselves to me ; how many centuries must have passed to produce the present change in the character of the country ? What means of subsistence could this sterile region have afforded at the time these works were in operation? Whence was water obtained to give motion to the ma chinery ? Why was this spot chosen ? As I could not l 3"], [288, "226 SYRIA, find a satisfactory answer to any of these questions, I leave them to the speculations of others. At some few leagues from hence, in the vicinity of Said, the agents of Mehemet-Ali have discovered a rich coal mine, of exceUent quality, which they are pre paring to work.* The western side of Libanus is composed of transition strata, and of calcareous rock and schist; the eastern exhibits only new calcareous matter containing portions of agate. As we descended the mountain, Baalbeck appeared in sight, at the distance of about four leagues. It is situated on the further side of the valley, at the base of Anti-Libanus ; and even at that distance its white, lofty, and extensive ruins produce a deep impression on the beholder. We slept at the ruined vUlage of Tareita, which from the size of its cemetery, I conclude to have formerly been a place of considerable magnitude. We observed a widow praying near her husband's grave. He had lately died, and as a proof of her devotion to him, she had cut off her beautiful hah, and had placed it over his tomb, where it hung floating in the wind. The surrounding objects were in harmony with this melancholy scene, for everything within our view was desolate. The plain was untdled, scarcely a sign of vegetation was perceptible, excepting in a few old trees of stunted growth, and the inhabitants were clothed in rags. It was, in short, the picture of the desert, ren dered stdl more sad by the appearance of .our species in its most degraded state. However, we had no altema- * The author appears to have given a solution of his own questions ; \u2014 for the circumstance of there being a rich coal mine at the distance of only a few leagues, makes it probable that another may have existed not far from the position where the Marshal fancied he saw proofs of iron having been manufactured. (T.)"], [289, "227 TARE1TA. tive but to halt at Tareita for the night, as there was no other place, in this part of the country, at which water could be procured. Even here it was scarce, for the pool was dried up from which the wretched inhabi tants of the district are usuaUy supplied, and we were in consequence obliged to obtain what we requhed from a distant weU. The inhabitants of Tareita, and indeed the whole population of the valley of C\u0153li-Syria, comprehended between the ranges of Libanus and Anti- Libanus, are of the nation of the Metuahs, and are said to be very inhospitable. They are schismatic Mussulmans, for ming part of the sect of Ali, which is very numerous in Persia and in the centre of Asia. Between this sect and the more rigid one of Omar, to which the Turks belong, a very hostUe feeling exists. The Metualis are considered brave and enterprising, and almost the whole of the male population are bri gands ! but they are extremely superstitious, and think themselves polluted by contact with strangers to their creed. In the pohtical convulsions that have, at various periods, desolated Syria, the Metuahs have played a very conspicuous part. The consequent drain upon theh numbers, together with theh miserable state of destitution, bave considerably reduced their power, but they are still sufficiently formidable to be dreaded by their neighbours as weU as by traveUers. It is a singular fact that these people have no know ledge of the places from whence they came, although a short period only has elapsed since they settled here. On quitting Tareita, we directed our course towards Baalbeck, needing no other guide than its majestic ruins, across the spacious plain before us. This plain,"], [290, "228 SYRIA, although once so productive, has now become a barren waste. Being deshous of shortening our journey, we avoided the beaten track, and met with no impediment, as the principal river which rises in Anti-Libanus and flows towards Said, enters the plain below the hne of our route, and the beds of the rivulets on both sides of the vaUey were at that time perfectly dry. There was a degree of independence in our style of traveUing which to me was peculiarly agreeable. The Bedouins consider the valley of C\u0153li- Syria, as exclusively their own, and therefore occupy it at those periods of the year which are the most convenient to them. A traveller cannot fail to be struck by the remarkable difference between the constitution of the social state of Europe and that of the East, where its element is not, as with us, the individual or the family, but the tribe ; and he must be equaUy astonished in observing the apparently recognised rights of property amongst a population so disproportioned in numbers to the immense extent of country it inhabits. One of these tribes takes possession of a valley, a district, or a province, and retains it until the close of the season, or until it is compeUed by the failure of the local re sources to remove to another spot, which probably it may have occupied in some preceding year. And this previous occupation is its only title to the land. We found the tribe of Amamera in possession of the country round Baalbeck, and in crossing the plain we passed through their encampment, which like all those of the Bedouins was of a wretched description, the only shelter these people had from the elements, being the fragments of some miserable tents. They protect themselves against unwelcome intruders, by enormous"], [291, "BAALBECK. 229 dogs, who are ferocious to strangers, although gentle and docile to their masters. The tribe above named consists of about two thousand souls, subdivided into various sections, which unite or separate, according to circumstances. It had at the time of our visit large flocks of sheep, a numerous herd of cattle, and several horses of extraordinary beauty. Mount Becharres which overlooks Tripoli, and ap- pears to be even higher than Mount Sannin, was on our left, during this day's march. We remarked some few patches of snow, in parts which were screened by the sun's rays. To the right we saw the mountain of Sheick, terminating the chain of Anti-Libanus, and of about the same elevation as Becharres. Reaching Baalbeck very late, we encamped on the bank of a rivulet, shaded by the foliage of a grove of magnificent filbert trees. There is in Syria during the night an extraordinary degree of still- ness, which, combined with the extreme brUbancy of the heavens produce on the stranger deep and indescribable emotions. In this instance the peculiar charm was heightened from the sUence being broken by the gentle murmuring of the stream. Our tents being pitched, we took precautions against the attacks of tigers, which are not uncommon in this situation, and we made the other requisite arrangements for the night. We then retired to seek the repose which a most fatiguing day had rendered necessary ; but with an impatient longing for the arrival of the following morning, when we looked forward to the gratification of inspecting the beautiful ruins which formed the chief object of this part of our journey. At daybreak we repaired to the temple, and our astonishment on beholding the vastness of its size was"], [292, "230 SYRIA only equaUed by the admiration we felt on examining the delicate ornaments, and exquisite workmanship, with which it was embeUisbed. Baalbeck is one of the most ancient cities of Asia ; and at a very early period it had a temple dedicated to the sun. Baalbeck, in Syriac, means \"City of the Sun,\" as does \" Heliopolis\" in Greek, which name it also bore. The city itself must have been of small extent, and although garrisoned by a Roman legion, its importance was derived entirely from its rehgious character. The ancient temple having been destroyed, a more modern was built in the reign of Antoninus Pius. Even if the inscription it bears did not accurately fix the period of its erection, this might be determined by the beautiful example of the Corinthian order of archi tecture which this temple affords. In contemplating the ruins of the temples of Antoninus and Faustinus at Rome, we may almost fancy we again behold those of Baalbeck. This temple having been budt only a short time before the establishment of Christianity in Asia, soon lost its importance as a place of heathen worship. A part of it was subsequently used as a church, and at a later period it became a military post for those who occupied the country. The ruins are of vast extent, and are evidently the remains, not of one, but of two temples placed contiguously. The principal entrance had a facade of more than fifty metres (54|* English yards) in length, and was adorned with twelve magnificent columns. There were two immense courts, rich in architectural embeUishments, and adorned with nume rous columns of extraordinary dimensions. In examin ing the remains of these buildings, I observed many"], [293, "231 BAALBECK. stones whose contents measured a hundred and fifty cubic metres (5297 English cubic feet) ; indeed, there was one piece, not quite detached from a rock, that measured no less than four hundred and fifty cubic metres (15,892 English cubic feet).* * To give a more complete idea of this work, I shaU add Volney's very accurate and detaUed description : \u2014 - \" Let us suppose that we are descending from the interior of the city. After passing the rubbish and the huts that have been built upon it, we arrive at an open space, which must have been a square. Towards the west we perceive a considerable heap of ruins, formed by two pavilions, which were enriched with pilasters, and united by a wall of a hundred and sixty-feet in length : this facade is placed on a sort of terrace at the edge of which are discovered the bases of twelve columns, that stood between the pavUions and formed the portico. The gateway is obstructed by a mound of stones ; but, by chmbing over them, we enter a hexagonal court of a hundred and eighty feet in diameter, over which are scattered, not only broken columns, mutilated capitals, fragments of pilasters, entablatures, and cornices, but also some entire shafts and specimens of the most beautiful ornaments of architecture. At the end of this court there is an opening, through which an extensive view is obtained of other ruins that also merit attention. In order to see them with advantage, it is necessary to ascend a slope formed by the ruins of a staircase : at the top we find ourselves at the entrance of a square court, much more spacious than the former. We perceive, at its extremity, six enormous columns rising majestically above the horizon, and forming, with the view seen in the intervals, a beautiful picture. A not less interesting object is another series of columns to the left hand, which formed the peristyle : but before proceeding further, we cannot refrain from attentively observing the buildings on both sides, which are enclosed by this court. They form a kind of corridor, subdivided into fourteen chambers, seven of which are on either side of the great aisles. They are open towards the court, but at the further end have pediments, niches and tabernacles, highly ornamsnted with devices. Although we cannot discover what may have been the object of these chambers, we do not the less admire their beauty, especiaUy the form of the pUasters, and the richness of the frieze. At last we reach the six columns above mentioned, and it is then, on observing the boldness of their dimensions, that our astonishment is complete. Their shafts are twenty-one feet eight inches in circumference, and fifty-eight feet long \u2022 so that the total"], [294, "232 SYRIA. Great as was our astonishment at contemplating all that is magnificent and beautiful in the ruins of the Temples of Baalbeck, our wonder was increased when we reflected that these edifices were erected with corn- height, including the entablature, is upwards of seventy-one feet. We naturaUy wonder at seeing this superb and weU preserved part of the ruin apparently unconnected with any other portion of the temple ; but on a careful examination of the ground, we perceive a suite of pedestals ranged on the side of a quadrangle, which measures two hundred and sixty -eight feet by a hundred and forty-six; and thence we conclude that this was the peristyle of a large temple, the principal object of the entire mass. Towards the great court, that is, to the east, it shows a front of ten columns, with nineteen on each side, (making a total of fifty-four.) \" Such was the original form of this edifice ; but in course of time the southern side of the great temple was thrown down, to admit of buUding the smaUer one, whose peristyle is stiU extant. This smaUer temple, which was on a lower level than the larger one, had thirteen columns on each side, and eight appeared at either end, so that there were thirty-eight in all; the angular columns being seen both at the ends and sides. These columns, wliich were also of the Corinthian order, had a circumference of fifteen feet eight inches, and a height of forty-four feet. It would be tedious to give aU the detaUs of this buUd ing, and it is therefore hoped that the foregoing particulars will suffice to present an idea of its grandeur. The earthquake of 1789 overturned several columns, and also rent the waUs of the smaller temple; but nature has not been the only agent of destruction, as the Turks have been still more active in throwing down the columns, \u2014 their only object being to get the iron wliich formed their axes. It is surprising that the stones of the temple, though they have been exposed to the atmosphere for so many centuries, should stiU preserve their original whiteness ; but the dimensions of some of them are still more astonishing. On the western side, the second layer is formed of immense blocks, some of which measure as much as 35 feet in length by 9 feet in height. These stones are of a whitish granite ; and not only does the city stand on a stratum of this material, but the adjacent hiUs are composed of it. In one of the quarries I observed a stone, not quite detached from the rock, which was 69 feet 2 inches long, 12 feet 10 inches wide, and 13 feet 3 inches deep. It is not easy to conceive by what means the ancients moved such ponderous blocks.\""], [295, "233 BAALBECK. parative facility, at the command of a Roman emperor, in an obscure city at the distance of six hundred leagues from his capital. In the present day the efforts of aU the monarchs of Europe could not accom plish such an undertaking. Various modern works have been formed amongst these ruins, to prepare them for defence, but it is easy to distinguish these additions from the ancient budd ings, and in imagination to divest oneself of theh presence, so as to perceive only the remains of the temples, which are nearly in the same state as when they were described by Volney. The ancient city stood in an amphitheatre formed by the slope of a hdl, and the boundary waUs were so placed as to include an area in the shape of an Isosceles triangle, whose apex was the highest point of the enclosure. Nothing can be more loathsome and forbidding than the collection of half-ruined huts which cover the surface, and which are the very acme of wretchedness. Baalbeck is inhabited by Metuahs, and presents a stUl more gloomy picture of the misery we observed at the vUlage of Tareita. This city is favoured by nature, in the fertility of the surrounding country, in possessing an abundance of water, and in the salubrity of the climate; yet its state of poverty is rapidly destroying it, and notwith standing that its population only a few years since amounted to ten thousand souls, it is now reduced to twelve hundred. At the entrance of the city, and by the side of the large temple, there is another temple, which was pro bably erected at an earlier period; this, although smaller, must have been very beautiful, and is even"], [296, "234 SYRIA, stUl imposing, being in the purest style of Roman architecture. It reminded me of the one dedicated to Janus at Rome. I went to the bottom of the valley, where the river of Baalbeck issues from Anti-Libanus. It is one of the most beautiful streams I ever saw; the water is of excellent quahty and so abundant, that it has suffi cient power to put in motion the rude machinery of the inhabitants of this district. Its temperature, on coming to the surface of the ground, was 15 degrees centigrades. So excessive was the heat of the atmosphere at Baalbeck, and so powerful the rays of the sun, that we could almost imagine such causes to have led to the erection of the temple in honour of that planet. The form of this edifice disproves the assertions of some antiquaries, who state that all the temples dedicated to the sun were round, as a type of the circular motion of that celestial body. The plan of that which I have described is rectangular, and so built that the entrance, facing due east, admitted the sun's rays as soon as the planet touched the horizon. Thus the divinity appeared dady to take possession of the sanctuary at the instant of becoming visible to man. On the 5th of September, I ascended the western side of Anti-Libanus, and crossed the ridge at a point where it is considerably depressed; it afterwards rises in approaching the sea coast, and terminates at the mountain of Sheick. The country we passed over is covered with a fertile sod; but the population is insufficient for its cultivation; and we merely saw a few miserable vUlages in our route. We descended into a narrow and weU cultivated vaUey, which is fertilized by the waters of the Sur-"], [297, "235 ANTI-LIBANUS. gaya. This small river, on entering C\u0153li-Syria, unites with that from Zathne, and forms the Said, which empties itself into the sea. I had frequent occasion to remark, in this part of my tour, that wherever there was an abundance of water, the land was very produc tive. I proceeded to the source of the Surgaya, whose temperature, on issuing from the ground, was 12*5 centigrades. A short distance from hence, I observed another rivulet whose course was in an opposite direc tion, being towards Damascus, while the Surgaya flows to the Mediterranean. The inclination of the mountain is here so gentle, that I should have been unconscious of having crossed the summit, but for the direction of the little river caUed the \"Barada,\" which denoted that we were descending, and had entered the great basin of the Euphrates. In fact, the water of this stream would find its way to the Persian Gulf, if not absorbed in the hrigation of the highly cultivated land through which it takes its course. The eastern side of Anti-Libanus is incomparably superior to the western ; and it is worthy of remark, that in the two paraUel ranges of Libanus and Anti- Libanus, the sterile parts face each other, and form opposite sides of the great vaUey of C\u0153li-Syria, which is thus bordered by dry and arid mountains. The fertile portions are consequently the western side of Libanus, and the eastern side of Anti-Libanus. We encamped near a pretty rivulet, at a short distance from Zubdam, which is the most beautiful vUlage that I met with in Syria; it appeared weU peopled and in a prosperous condition, and I observed nothing of that wretchedness which is the prevading feature of the East."], [298, "236 SYRIA, Throughout this day's journey we were under the guidance of a young Arab named Elyas, whom we engaged at Sassayack, a miserable viUage at the top of Anti-Libanus, and about two leagues distance from Baalbeck. He was a Christian of the Greek church; of a kind and lively disposition, finely proportioned, and very active. Like the rest of his nation, he had a strong affection for his horse, and he possessed a degree of practical philosophy which rendered him comparatively indifferent to the course of passing events; and, regardless of the future, he contented himself with enjoying the present, and recoUecting the pleasures of the past. His fervid imagination, con stantly excited by the charms of a beautiful climate, sweetened his hfe, and created an imaginary existence far surpassing any reality. This man was such as eastern tales depict the Arab, winning upon those whom he desires to please, by his simplicity, and by the truth and gudelessness of his character, and excit ing their astonishment by his natural enthusiasm for everything that is magnanimous in sentiment, or beautiful in nature. I derived great pleasure from conversing with this young man; his observations always bore the stamp of sound judgment, and showed that he possessed a feeling and generous soul. I asked him if he were married, and he replied in the negative, but added that he had a beautiful mistress ; and on my inquiring if he would defend her against those who might try to tear her from him, he exclaimed, with a degree of energy and feeling that I shaU never forget, \"Against ten would I defend her, and even untd death, if she be faithful to me; but not against a single arm, or even for a single moment, if I could suspect her to be false.\" What a noble sentiment"], [299, "DAMASCUS. 237 to spring from this simple-hearted, but right-minded youth ! On the sixth we set out, at daylight, for Damascus, stdl keeping in the plain and foUowing the course of its waters, which pass close to the city, fertilizing the dehcious gardens of the neighbourhood. The vaUey varies much in width : where, by the receding of the rocks it is permitted to expand, nature shines out in aU her richest beauties ; but in other parts it is con tracted to a narrow strip of verdure. In those situa tions where the ground is above the level to which the water can attain, sterility prevaUs, and nothing is seen but white and arid rocks. This mournful picture undergoes no change, excepting for a few months of winter and of the early spring, when moisture produces a httle vegetation, of which, however, at the period of my visit, there was not the slightest sign. In order to avoid the winding circuit of the beaten track, we clambered over a ridge of calcareous rocks, and on reaching the top we caught the first view of Damascus, standing at the foot of the mountains, which skirt the plain on the north and western sides, and at no great distance from us. Nothing can surpass the magic beauty of this enchanting scene. After the melancholy impression we had received from the barrenness of the district through which we had recently passed, our spirits were raised to a state of ecstasy, on discovering the vast Oasis now before us. The view extends over a surface of six or seven leagues in length, and three or four in breadth, covered with the most refreshing and brilliant verdure. In the middle of this smiling plain, Damas cus rises in majestic beauty, adorned not only with the splendid private mansions of its rich inhabitants, but"], [300, "238 SYRIA. also witb mosques, bazaars, and various other public buildings. The whole of the plain is covered with gardens and orchards, and the natural fertihty of the soil is so much increased, owing to its irrigation by the waters of the Barada, and its tributary streams, that the produce is sufficient to supply the wants of the whole population. At the period of our visit, general discontent pre vailed in the city, in consequence of the order issued by Ibrahim Pacha, to disarm the inhabitants. A wise precaution, for the people of Damascus have at aU times been difficult to govern, and have frequently revolted. The disarming, however, was carried into effect without difficulty, affording ample proof of the moral influence exercised by Mehemet AU. We repaired to the humble convent of St. Lazarus, where we were hospitably received by the worthy monks, and especially by fathers Pousson and Testre, Frenchmen by birth. Notwithstanding the minute inspection I made of Damascus I found little in it to interest me ; regarded however as a Turkish city, it is handsome; the bazaars are extensive, but almost ex clusively fiUed with foreign merchandize. It is wonder ful how the industrious habits have diminished for which this city was once so remarkable. Nothing is now manufactured here but what is indispensably necessary for the immediate wants of the population ; and every article of a costly nature, or requiring care ful workmanship, is imported, so that Damascus is reduced to a mere place of barter, where the merchan dize brought from Europe is exchanged with that which is received from Arabia and Persia. At Damascus a superior style of living is kept up by the Turkish famUies which is nowhere else met with"], [301, "DAMASCUS. 239 among these people. This city contains the most beautiful mansions of the East. They have large haUs faced with white marble, fountains, and handsome courts, which are tastefully planted, and laid out as ornamental gardens. I visited some of the rich Christian merchants, who received me with hospitality, and, according to the custom usually observed on such occasions, offered me refreshments, whicb consisted of coffee, sweetmeats, and sherbet. Their residences rival in splendour those of the wealthy Mahometans, and reminded me of the houses of the Beys at Caho, which I had seen during the period of the occupation of that city by the French army. I also traced a similarity in their habits and manners. It is computed that the whole population of Damas cus does not exceed a hundred thousand souls; and judging from a census recently taken, for the purpose of a capitation tax, I am inchned to think that this is a just estimate. Tbe inhabitants of Damascus were always the most violent fanatics of the East, and stiU entertain a great antipathy to Christians, and Franks in general. Before the rule of Mehemet-Ali this feeling had reached such a height, that it was unsafe for Europeans to appear in the streets in their own costume ; but this chief finding theh services often indispensable in furthering his pro jects, extended to them his especial protection. Pos sessing as he does the talent of making himself feared and respected, he insured a compliance with his wish by merely issuing an order to his Mussulman subjects not to molest persons of other creeds. It is a general practice in the East to subdivide the towns, and to prevent any communication during the"], [302, "240 SYRIA, night between the different quarters, by means of gates which are locked at sunset. The object of this muni cipal regulation is to render any sudden revolt almost impracticable, by creating a material obstacle to the assembling of large bodies of men. It is enforced with extreme rigour at Damascus, where the keys of the gates are deposited in the hands of the Governor. I found here a M. Baudin, who bears the title of consular agent for France. At the time the French Government sent officers into Syria for the purpose of purchasing stallions, this gentleman accompanied them in the capacity of commissary of the stud, and, having married, became a resident in this city. He is an obliging, zealous, and inteUigent person, and his assistance is invaluable to Europeans, whether attracted to Damascus by curiosity, or business. His general employment is in matters of a commercial nature. This place is the residence of Cherif Pacha, the Governor of Syria, who is a countryman and relative of Mehemet-Ali. On receiving a complimentary message from the Pacha, I called upon him, and was received with much kindness by this lively, good-humoured, and courteous Turk. He gave every requisite order for facilitating my journey, and assured me that the interior of Syria was now brought to such a state of tranquiUity, that I might travel throughout the pro vince in perfect safety. He proposed to show me the two regiments then stationed at Damascus. I eagerly accepted his offer, as I was desirous of seeing under arms the Egyptian soldiers, who had lately beaten the Turks, and of whom such favourable accounts had reached Europe. I was the more anxious to review them from having heard complaints made by the natives of their want of discipline, and from having"], [303, "DAMASCUS. 241 myself remarked them to be deficient in soldier-like appearance. But I must admit that, at the same time, I observed in the countenances of these men an expres sion of confidence, which is the index of courage, and which distinguishes the true soldier from the man who merely wears the mUitary dress. On the foUowing morning I repaired to the exer cising ground, where I found two battalions of the tenth regiment drawn up for inspection. They appeared to be but imperfectly drUled and undeserving the opinion I had been led to form of them. Having had an opportunity of minutely studying the organization of the Egyptian army, it is my intention to give a detailed description of it in a subsequent part of this work. I shaU there also endeavour to point out its defects, and the causes that have produced them; for although this army has proved itself superior to that of the Sultan, it is yet very far from possessing the degree of efficiency which it is capable of attaining, and which would give it the character of a respectable mUitary force in the estimation of European officers. Notwithstanding that Cherif Pacha takes no part in the mUitary arrangements of this district, and confines himself exclusively to the duties of the ciril admi nistration, yet his authority as Governor is recognized by the troops, who in that capacity not only yield him obedience, but shew him great respect. He was pre sent at the review, where, according to his usual custom, he was surrounded by a numerous suite of attendants on foot. I found in the Egyptian corps stationed at Damascus, several European officers, and amongst others, M. de Toron, who had served in the thhd regiment of the Royal Guard ; M. Baladin, who formerly held the rank 31"], [304, "242 SYRIA. of Captain in the sixty-fourth regiment of French Infantry ; and M. Cherubini, who had been appointed Physician to the Pacha. By the two first I was fur nished with various detaUs concerning the state of the army. They corroborated what I had previously heard of the capability of the Egyptians to become good soldiers, and they strengthened my own impression that the exceUent qualities of these people only required to be developed, under the influence of a judicious mibtary code, by officers of character and reputation. The Egyptian soldier is represented to be sober, steady, and brave ; he is able to undergo great fatigue, is imbued with enthusiasm which is easdy roused, and seems conscious that his position entitles him both to the respect of others and to his own self-esteem. By calling these invaluable quahties into action with pru dence and judgment, this army would be raised to a high degree of exceUence. When I was at Damascus, however, complaints were made of its relaxation of discipline, which was in a great measure attributed to an Ul-judged liberalism, that had been introduced into the service, and for which no rational motive could be assigned. For as the East may be regarded as the cradle of despotism, and the wiU of those in authority has there been ever considered as law, it would appear to be the very last spot on earth requiring the adoption of such a system. This absurd arrangement was nothing less than the absolute reversing of the ordinary principles of mditary promotion, by making it dependent, not on the opinion or the wdl of the superior officers, but on the passions and interests of the inferior grades. Thus the privates were empowered to select, out of theh own body, those who should be advanced to the rank or corporal, and in"], [305, "243 DAMASCUS. like manner the corporals nominated the serjeants. The natural consequence was, that the individuals who were promoted were those whom their feUow soldiers considered to be the most favourable to a lax state of discipline, and as might have been expected the greatest disorder and insubordination prevaded. Amongst other unwise regulations, the soldiers were exempt from every kind of summary punishment, and even the most trivial offence was brought under the cognizance of a regimental tribunal, by which it was judged and the penalty awarded. And in this instance, the colonel himself had no more power than the sub ordinate officers, being equaUy obliged to bring offen ders before this court. But a stdl greater absurdity was, that the sentence could not be carried into effect without the approval of Ibrahim Pacha ; and as that chief was frequently distant a ten days' journey from the station where the offence was committed, most inconvenient delays took place. The whole of this unwise system has however been discontinued, and a more rational one substituted for it; but as it existed for a considerable period, it is matter of astonishment that a course of misgovernment, which would have pro duced the most fatal consequences amongst troops of any other nation, should not have had the effect of totaUy disorganizing the Egyptian army. M 2"], [306, "244 WAE OF 1832. Having reached the scene of the operations of the Egyptian army, in the year 1832, I shaU attempt a description of the campaign, in the belief that it wdl prove interesting to the military reader, from the evi dence it affords of the soldier-like qualities of these troops, and the talent displayed by their chief. Several thousand Egyptian peasants, being in a state of great discontent, abandoned theh villages and took refuge in Syria. It happened that AbdaUah, the Pacha of Acre and Governor of the Province, was under great personal obligations to Mehemet Ali, but notwithstanding this and other powerful incentives to gratitude, he did not hesitate to adopt a course in opposition to the interests of his benefactor; and, disregarding every remonstrance, he afforded an asylum to aU who sought his protection. Mehemet Ali, fearing that this emi gration might become contagious, and ultimately prove injurious to Egypt, determined to arrest its progress and avenge himself on the ungrateful AbdaUah, by taking possession of Syria. It is probable also that motives of aggrandisement influenced Mehemet Ah to adopt this course ; for Syria not only contains a numerous and warhke population, from which he might hope to derive assistance in his future operations, but it possesses iron, wood and coal, the natural treasures which are most wanting in Egypt."], [307, "WAR OF 1832. 245 Its extensive commerce with the interior of Asia, and the importance it acquires from the annual journeys of the caravan to Mecca and back, offered a stiU further inducement to attempt its conquest.* The prospect of obtaining these advantages en couraged Mehemet Ali to pursue the man against whom he had so much cause of complaint, and he therefore ordered his son, Ibrahim Pacha, to put him self at the head of the army, and pass the desert. Abdallah Pacha not having a sufficient number of troops for tbe defence of Syria, rethed to St. Jean d'Acre, and with the exception of that place the whole province submitted to the Egyptians, who were well received by the inhabitants. The army of Ibrahim Pacha, which amounted to about forty thousand men, consisted of six regiments of infantry, each composed of four battalions ; of eight regiments of cavalry ; and of three or four thousand Bedouins, who performed the outpost duties. The field artillery comprised sixty pieces of cannon, and there was also an ample battering train. A squadron of five ships of the hne, and several frigates sailed from Alexandria, and proceeded to the Syrian coast, to co-operate with the army. Ibrahim Pacha laid siege to St. Jean d'Acre, but the attack was conducted with so little skill, that notwithstanding an immense consumption of ammunition, the fortress had not surrendered at the end of five months, when a Turkish army was put in motion for its relief. Ibrahim Pacha learned that eighteen or twenty thou- * The caravan aUuded to is the \" Surree,\" which conveys to Mecca the rich carpet and other yearly presents to the Kaaba. It is attended by thousands of pilgrims (Hadjis), who expend considerable sums during their pious journey. (T.)"], [308, "246 SYRIA, sand Turks, composed of regular and irregular troops, had arrived at Horns, the ancient Emessa, on the banks of the Orontes, and that another army stiU more nume rous was advancing against him from Anatolia, under the orders of Hussein Pacha, who had acquired great celebrity by his gaUant conduct, in the destruction of the Janissaries. Information was also received that a corps, under the orders of Osman Pacha, was marching towards Tripoli. Ibrahim in consequence reduced the number of troops employed against St. Jean d'Acre, leaving only such as were indispensable for the prose cution of the siege. He made a demonstration on Tripoli, with a single regiment of infantry, one of cavahy, and some Bedouins ; and dispatched the remainder of his force to Baalbeck, under the orders of Abbas Pacha. On hearing of the march of Ibrahim, the Turks prepared to retreat, and after a shght engagement feU back on Horns, where they joined the main body of theh army. Ibrahim pursued them as far as Khan-Kousseh, and from thence rethed to Baalbeck, where he remained to observe the operations of the enemy. This position was admirably suited for defence, for it covered the siege, by com manding the shortest and most direct route between Horns and St. Jean d'Acre and from having the \"Appui\" both of Libanus and Anti-Libanus, it could neither be attacked in front, nor easdy turned. It was therefore impossible for the Turks to reach St. Jean d'Acre with out previously defeating the army occupying this posi tion. For instance if they marched towards Damascus, Ibrahim could fall upon theh right flank ; if towards Tripoli, he could attack their left ; and therefore under all the chcumstances Baalbeck was the fittest post for the Egyptian army while watching the turn of events."], [309, "WAR OF 1832. 247 The Turks remaining quiet, Ibrahim Pacha rejoined the force engaged in the siege of Acre, and on the faU of that place, he commenced offensive operation in the field. He sent a weak corps, under the orders of Hassan bey-Monasthli to Tripoli, and leaving a part of his troops at Baalbeck proceeded with the remainder against Damascus. As soon as the Egyptian columns arrived before that city, Ah Pacha, the Turkish commandant, retreated upon Horns. Ibrahim Pacha, being thus enabled to take possession of Damascus, determined to concentrate his army, and for that purpose moved the three columns composing it upon Khan-Kousseh, where they met on the evening of the 6th July (the 8th Sefer). The several corps of the Turkish army had not then formed theh junction, because Hussein Pacha, their commander, was stdl at Antioch, with a part of the troops; and a force of between thirty and thirty-five thousand men remained in theh encampment near Horns, under the orders of the Mehemet-Pacha, one of the chiefs of the Nizzam,* and a favourite of the Seraskier Khosrew. On the foUowing morning the whole of the Egyptian army advanced against the city. At two o'clock in the afternoon, when stiU at some distance, it formed in line, having the lake on its left, and the desert on its right. The Turkish army quitted its position and prepared to attack the Egyptians. It would have been much wiser in Mehemet Pacha, to have moved on the pre ceding evening, and to have taken possession of Khan- Kousseh, at the head of the lake, for in that case the junction of the Egyptian columns would have been * That is the newly organized troops. (T.)"], [310, "248 SYRIA. rendered more difficult, and the Turkish force would then have had a chance of attacking them separately. The Egyptian army consisted of seven regiments of infantry, each comprising four battahons ; six regiments of cavalry, divided into twenty-four squadrons ; seven batteries of artUlery, and two howitzers. It formed in three lines. The first, which was com posed of twelve battahons, deployed. The second, composed of the same number of battahons, took up their position in column, at deployment distance ; and the third, consisting ofthe four battahons of the remain ing regiment, was also placed in column, at deployment distance. The six regiments of cavalry were posted on the flanks of the three hnes of infantry. The batteries were dis posed as follows : three in the first hne, one being on each flank and the other in the centre ; and the remain ing four with the howitzers, in reserve, behind the second hne. The baggage was stationed between the second and third hnes. The whole of this arrangement was so judicious and complete as to leave no opening for criticism. The Turkish army had deployed, and was formed in two hnes ; the cavahy being placed on the flanks, and the artillery distributed amongst the infantry, in the proportion of one gun to each battahon. The order of battle adopted by the Egyptians was, from its great superiority, obviously calculated to ensure their success. The regiment of infantry, on the right of the second line, took ground to its right and towards the front, and was so placed that on deploying it might stand oblique to the first line, whde the regiment on the right of the first line, by a change of direction, and a move ment to the right, posted itself in prolongation of that"], [311, "WAR OF 1832. 249 of the second line above alluded to. To complete this man\u0153uvre the second regiment of the second hne assumed the position originaUy occupied by the first regiment of the first line, by which means the regiments, thus thrown forward, out-flanked the left of the Turkish army. The greater part of the artillery of reserve, and the three regiments of cavalry of the right wing of the Egyptian army, were posted so as to cover and support this movement, the latter being in readiness to attack the rear of the enemy. The regiment on the left flank of the second hne with the cavalry of that wing moved further to the left, to threaten and keep in check the Turkish force in theh front. The Egyptians com menced the battle by the foUowing movements. The right of the first line, that is to say, the regi ments which had been thrown forward, advanced, while the centre of this line also advanced in an echellon of battahons to the right. The Turks being thus attacked in their centre and left wing wished to change the direction of theh front, by throwing back the left; but in attempting this man\u0153uvre, they feU into disorder, and were forced into a precipitate retreat, leaving on the field two thousand kdled, three thou sand prisoners, and twelve pieces of cannon. This action was not well contested by the Turks, which circum stance alone was a sufficient cause for the easy victory gained over them, but the success of the Egyptians may be also attributed to the precision of theh move ments, and to the skilful arrangements of Ibrahim Pacha. The result might likewise in a great degree be ascribed to the very injudicious disposition of the Turkish army, whose right was posted on an island M 3"], [312, "250 SYRIA, formed by the Orontes and a canal, and thereby prevented supporting the left or centre. At day-break on the following morning, the 8th of July (the tenth Sefer), the Egyptian army entered Horns, where it captured fifteen hundred men, and fourteen pieces of cannon. The remainder of the Turkish army retreated on Aleppo, and joined the force under the command of Hussein Pacha, where an attempt at resistance should have been made ; but instead of adopting that course, the city was evacuated on the approach of the Egyptians, and the Turks retired on Beylan, in two columns, one of which passed through Kliss, and the other through Antioch. The Egyptian army being severely attacked with cholera, Ibrahim determined to halt at Aleppo for some days, in order to give rest to his men ; and he was also deshous of putting aU his equipments, stores, and artiUery into a proper state for prosecuting the campaign. During this detention, reconnoitring parties were sent to the sources of the Euphrates, for the purpose of examining the mountain passes. At length the army set out to encounter the Turks, who were known to be encamped in front of the viUage of Beylan. Ibrahim detached some irregular troops to clear the route to Antioch, while the main body of the Egyp tians took the dhection of Kliss, and arrived in pre sence of the enemy, on the 29th of July (the second of Rebeil-awel), at three o'clock in the afternoon. The road by which the Egyptian army marched is directed towards tbe base of a chain of mountains, and after crossing the summit descends to the viUage of Beylan, which is situated at the bottom of its northern declivity."], [313, "WAR OF 1832. 251 The Turkish army was posted on the southern side, a httle below the top, and was covered by some re doubts which it had hastily thrown up; its left extended to the Beylan road, by which it would have had to rethe if defeated. Ibrahim Pacha, perceiving that there were heights which commanded this road, deter mined to take possession of them ; and in order to effect that object, he threatened the front of the Turkish army, with a part of his force, while with the remainder he ascended the heights, and turned the enemy's position. As soon as this movement was completed, he ordered the attack. The Turks being menaced both in theh front and on their hne of retreat, feU back; the troops of the left wing retreated by the Beylan road, but having to defile under the fire of four battahons of Egyptians, they lost a great number of men, and ultimately took to flight. This disaster deterred the rest of the army from attempting to retire by this route ; and as there was no other suited for the march of a large body of men, they dispersed and made theh way by the mountain tracks to Alexan dretta. This attack was judiciously planned and well executed. Great credit is due to Ibrahim Pacha for engaging the enemy immediately on his arrival, although it was already late in the day ; for if he had deferred doing so untd the foUowing morning, the result might have been very different, as it is probable that, in addi tion to the force which he defeated, he would have had to contend with the troops who, during the battle, remained at Bayas and Alexandretta. The Turks left twenty -five guns upon the field ; and on the foUowing day the Egyptian army, without oppo sition, took possession of Alexandretta, where they found fourteen pieces of ordnance, with immense stores"], [314, "252 SYRIA of provisions. The cavalry made a dash at Bayas, and succeeded in capturing nineteen hundred prisoners. This action produced the additional effect of enabhng the Egyptian army to take possession of Adana and Tarsus, and to compel the Turks to retire upon Mount Taurus. It is remarkable that it took place at a short distance from the spot where the ancient battle of Issus was fought, in which Alexander defeated the Persians. The Sultan at length determined to make a for midable effort to arrest the progress of an enemy whose success endangered the stabihty of his throne. The Turkish army was, therefore, augmented to upwards of fifty thousand men, and was provided with a nume rous artiUery. It was chiefly composed of regular troops; and the command was taken from Hussein Pacha and conferred on the Grand Vizier, Reschid Pacha, who had acquired a high reputation by his victories in Albania and Bosnia, as weU as by the paci fication of those provinces. Gifted with those primitive virtues which generally shine with extraordinary splen dour amongst a people whose civihzation is but httle advanced, Reschid Pacha had acquired great popularity from the nobleness of his character. He was, however, unacquainted with the principles of mditary tactics on an extensive scale, and was consequently unfitted to contend with so able a man as Ibrahim Pacha. The Egyptian army assembled at Adana, and re mained there till the 13th of October (17 Djemar-el awel). In the meanwhile, Aleppo was occupied by one of its detachments, and some hght corps watched the approaches to that city. A brigade composed of two regiments of infantry, and a corps of irregular cavahy, under the orders of a General of Division, took posses sion of Orfa, in order to cover the road from Sivas"], [315, "WAR OF 1832. 253 and Erzeroum, by Diarbekir, and also to hold Marasch, for the purpose of discovering the movements of the enemy in that part of the Taurus range. During these operations, Ibrahim Pacha kept up his communications with Egypt principally by sea. The troops having at length recovered from the fatigue, and the violence of the disease with which they had been attacked having considerably abated. Ibrahim Pacha determined to renew the campaign. Every necessary preparation having been made, an advanced guard was put in motion on the 14th October (the eighteenth of Djemar-el-awel) to reconnoitre the defiles of Mount Taurus, which were held by the Turks. This Egyptian corps consisted of two columns ; one of regular troops, who marched on Nemroud, and the other of irregulars, who proceeded to Tchifte-Khan, for the purpose of turning the enemy's position. These movements forced the Turks to evacuate the defiles, and retire on Erekli; on theh subsequently aban doning that place it was occupied by the Egyptian advanced guard, who remained there from the 20th October until the 12th November (the nineteenth of Djemar-el-aker). Being then supplied with rations and forage for six days, they resumed their march, and took the dhect road to Konieh, against which an irregular corps was detached by the route of Karaman. The main body of the army moved in five paraUel columns. The artillery, which was placed in the centre, had on its right and left a column of infantry, the cavahy being on either flank, and the whole separated by the intervals necessary to admit of theh deployment in two hnes. On the morning of the 17th of November the army set out from Kor Khan, and information having reached"], [316, "254 SYRIA, Ibrahim Pacha, that the enemy had evacuated Konieh in the night, he ordered a corps of cavahy, with twelve pieces of artiUery, to advance rapidly and take posses sion of that place. They met with no opposition, and captured a considerable quantity of provisions and artiUery. On the 18th, four regiments of cavalry and the Bedouins, with twelve pieces of cannon, were dis patched in pursuit of the Turks, on the route of Ak- Chehr, and, on coming up with the enemy, a slight engagement ensued, in which the Egyptians made a few prisoners. They then returned to Konieh, where the army halted for some days. On the 9th of December (the 17th of Regeb), Ibra him Pacha detached from Erekli, to Kaisarieh, a brigade of cavalry, with some battahons of infantry, and a battery of artUlery, under the command of Mahomed Bey. The object of this movement was to cover the right of his army and keep in check the corps of Osman Pacha, which had concentrated at Sivas, and threa tened his hne of operations. Contemplating the possibdity of having to give battle at Konieh, Ibrahim Pacha carefully studied the environs of that place, and having selected the ground for his position, frequently man\u0153uvred his troops upon it. On the 18th of December the Arnauts attacked Sileh, a village about two leagues distant to the west ward of Konieh, and occupied by two thousand Egyp tians, who had intrenched themselves and loopholed the walls. Ibrahim Pacha, with four battahons of infantry, a regiment of cavahy, and five hundred irre gular horsemen, marched against the Arnauts, defeated them, and captured five hundred prisoners, with eight stand of colours, and five guns. On the morning of the 19th it was ascertained that"], [317, "WAR OF 1832. 255 the whole of the Turkish army had quitted Ak-chehr, and that its advanced guard occupied a khan on the road to Ladick, three leagues distant from Konieh. Ibrahim Pacha gave orders to the Egyptian army to be in readiness to get under arms, and he himself moved forward without delay to attack the enemy, with one regiment of infantry, three of cavalry, and three bat teries of artUlery. A slight engagement with musketry ensued, and the Turks, although they were fifteen hun dred strong, and had intrenched themselves in the khan, surrendered at discretion. On the same evening, when Ibrahim Pacha returned to Konieh, five or six hundred Arnauts came to his head-quarters and offered to serve in the Egyptian army. On the 20th of the month, there being reason to believe that the Turkish army, under the command of the Grand Vizier, was advancing from Ladick towards Konieh, which is eight leagues distant, orders were given to prepare for battle on the foUowing day. The Turkish army was three times as numerous as that of the Egyptians, which only consisted of five regiments of infantry, of four battalions each ; of four regiments of cavahy, amounting to sixteen squadrons ; of six batteries, containing altogether thirty-six guns, and of some Bedouins and other irregular troops. On the morning of the 21st, the reconnoitring parties reported that the Grand Vizier had bivouacked with his army at the khan, which two days before had been captured by Ibrahim. At about midday, on its being announced that the enemy was advancing, the Egyptians got under arms, and formed in the foUowhig order, on the ground that had been previously selected for the field of battle. The first line consisted of two regiments, the whole of whose eight battahons were deployed."], [318, "256 SYRIA, The second line was also composed of two regiments, of which six battalions were in column, at deployment distance ; whde the remaining battalions, one being on either flank, were in square, a little in advance of the others, and with wider intervals, so as to cover the wings of both lines. The reserve, consisting of the regiment of guards, in columns of battalions, with a brigade of cavahy on each flank, formed a third line, behind the centre of the second. One battery was posted in the centre, and another at the extremities of the first line ; the remainder were in reserve. The Egyptian army took up this position in a thick fog, and on the atmosphere becoming clear, the enemy was observed at the distance of about two miles and a quarter, formed in four fines ; the first being deployed, and the other three in con tiguous columns, with the cavalry in rear of the flanks. The right flank of the Turkish army was secured by the mountains of SUeh, and the left by the marshes of Konieh. The direction of the Egyptian lines was such as to \" refuse theh left.\" In taking up this position, Ibra him Pacha foresaw that much embarrassment would thereby be caused to the enemy, by compelUng him either to deploy at right angles to his hne of march, or in a line paraUel to the Egyptian army. If the enemy adopted the former alternative, the left of the Egyp tians would be beyond his reach, and therefore disposa ble to assist their right, and if he adopted the latter, his wings would deprived of the \" appui \" afforded by the marshes and the heights. The ground in front of his right wing, being suitable for the movement of every description of force, afforded another inducement for Ibrahim Pacha bringing that"], [319, "WAR OF 1832. 257 part of his army into action ; because, in the event of his overthrowing the left of the Turks, he would be enabled to pursue the routed troops with greater advantage. The Turkish army advanced in tolerable order, but was prevented by the fog from taking up the position which was most advantageous for it with reference to that of the Egyptians. The Turks deployed perpen dicularly to their line of march, but performed this man\u0153uvre so badly that a considerable space intervened between the left of the infantry and the right of the cavahy. The Turkish force, though stiU enveloped in a dense fog, commenced firing on arriving within three hundred toises (640 Enghsh yards) of the Egyptians. This inju dicious act marked the position of the Turkish hne, and shewed that the artiUery was distributed in the pro portion of two guns for each battahon. The atmo sphere becoming clearer for a short time, Ibrahim Pacha perceived the interval in the Turkish line, and decided on attempting to penetrate through it with his reserve and cavalry. Several skilful movements having placed his troops in a position which enabled them to take the enemy in flank, he commenced the attack. The Egyptian cavahy beat that of the Turks, which was forced to retreat ; and afterwards, with the assistance of the infantry of the guard, compeUed the Turkish infantry to surrender. In the meanwhile the right wing of the Turkish army had advanced, and surrounded the lest of the Egyp tians; but having in its approach to traverse a con siderable space, the left and centre of the Turkish cavahy had been routed before the engagement of its right wing had become serious. The Egyptian left, reinforced by a part of the artillery of reserve, held"], [320, "258 SYRIA, its ground though repeatedly attacked, and the battalion which was in square defended itself on three sides ; repulsing all its assaUants. At length a body of Turkish cavahy, amounting to two thousand five hundred men, in order to make a last effort for victory, rushed upon the left of the Egyp tians, and, being unable to throw them into disorder or to check theh fire, penetrated through theh inter vals, and passed on to Konieh, which they pUlaged. But the capture of the Grand Vizier, and the defeat of the left wing of his army becoming known, that part of the right wing which was still engaged precipitately retreated. Such was the battle of Konieh, the consequences of which, if properly followed up, might have been felt far beyond the hmits of the Ottoman Emphe, for the moral effect of this victory extended its influence throughout the enthe peninsula of Asia Minor; and the Turkish army having dispersed, the inhabitants of the country, then in a state of discontent, found Uberators in the Egyptians, whose discipline presented a striking con trast to the conduct of the Sultan's troops. Mussul mans regarded the Egyptians as the avengers of Heaven, for the infractions of the laws of the Koran ; and con sidered Mehemet Ali as the protector of Islamism. Public opinion declared itself in favour of the conque rors ; there was no other battle to be fought ; no further opposition to be expected, and Ibrahim Pacha had only to take possession of the country. If, therefore, he had marched upon Constantinople on the day succeeding that on which the last victory was achieved he might have arrived opposite to that capital, without difficulty, by the third or fourth of January, at which period the Russian auxihary corps had not reached the Bosphorus."], [321, "WAR OF 1832. 259 The appearance of the Egyptians at Scutari would have produced a revolution at Constantinople, and overturned the Turkish Government, crushing the Sultan in its faU, or compeUing him to act as an instrument of Ibrahim's power. Mussulman fanaticism would then have been rekindled, aU the Osmanlies would have taken up arms in obedience to the caU of the Egyptian leader, and any attempt of Russia upon Constantinople could have presented but httle prospect of success, especiaUy if a French or English fleet had come to Ibrahim's assis tance. A new Mussulman emphe might then have risen, which, with Egypt for its basis, would have been guaranteed from external dangers, and from those revolutions which the turbulent sphit of the Turks so frequently produce. The Arabs forming its chief strength would have found themselves, at the very outset, in the possession of a brilliant reputation, and would have been respected Ly European nations, from the successftd adoption of theh military institutions. The administration of this new emphe would have been systematic and powerful, and Turkey in Europe must then have regained a part of her former importance. But a different course was foUowed : it was thought practicable to save a state which a breath might over turn, and a task has thus been undertaken that pro bably is not to be accomplished. In fact what Ibrahim Pacha would at that time have found easy of execution has now become impossible, for the chcumstances which were favourable to him have disappeared, and in their place insurmountable difficulties have sprung up hi aU directions* * What these insurmountable difficulties may have been, the Marshal does not explain ; but if he be correct in asserting that Ibrahim Pacha,"], [322, "260 SYRIA, The Egyptian army halted at Konieh till the 20th of January (the 29th of Chaban), when it advanced towards Constantinople. Having on the 1st of Fe bruary reached Kutchieh, it was stopped by the inter vention of the European powers. Negotiations were opened, and a division of the Russian army arriving in the Bosphorus encamped on the Asiatic shore. From that moment the throne of the Sultan was secured against Mehemet Ali, as well as against the rebelhous Mussulmans of Constantinople, and the treaty of Kutchieh put an end to the war. The part taken in this treaty by the principal Euro pean Governments has given a firm position to Mehemet Ali, who is in consequence recognized as a great vassal of the Ottoman Empire. He is now in possession of an acknowledged power of which the Sultan has no longer the right to deprive him, and its daily increasing strength not only renders this power stiU more secure, but affords it a more solid support than the pretended good feeling exhibited towards Mehemet Ah at Con stantinople. if in possession of Constantinople, could have defied the Russians to capture it, how much more difficult for them would it be now (in 1854) to succeed in such an attempt. The Egyptian and Turkish armies are united under one government : the Black Sea is in possession of the com bined fleets of England and France, and the powerful and admirably equipped and valorous armies of these two Western empires being on the point of placing themselves, if not in a position to attack the Russians, which it is to be hoped they wUl do, at least in a position to prevent their advance on Constantinople. Whatever in a strategical point of view may be the wisest course for French and Enghsh armies to take, there ean be no question that moral considerations should induce them to take the offensive. If unhappily they should not adopt this course, the prestige of our invincibUity wiU vanish, and whUe a fatal discouragement will be given to the Turks, the Russians will acquire that increased confidence which wiU add vastly to their chances of success. (_T.)"], [323, "AVAR OF 1832. 261 It is only fair to remark that Ibrahim Pacha restored to the Grand Vizier everything of which he had been plundered by the Bedouins, and treated him with great respect and generosity. The report of the victorious march of the Egyptians spread in all dhections, and the various civil and military authorities of Asia- Minor and Syria submitted to the conqueror. Deputations came from every quarter to do homage to his power, and the people were so favourably inchned towards him, that on the arrival of some Bedouins at Magnesia, the Muetzehm in com mand of the important city of Smyrna was driven away by the inhabitants, who established a new autho rity in the name of Mehemet Ah. The campaign of 1832 was highly honourable to Ibrahim Pacha, and I believe all intelligent mihtary men will admit that it is not open to criticism, having been conducted with prudence, sagacity, and vigour. If in the three battles which I have described, Ibrahim committed an error in employing his second hne and reserve at the commencement of the action, an excuse may be found for it, in recollecting that he was aware of the bad qualities of the troops opposed to him. That he was endued with mUitary genius can hardly be questioned ; but still he was peculiarly fortunate in being well seconded by a man of great talent. Soliman Pacha, the individual in question, who, in the campaign of 1832, held the important post of chief of the Egyp tian staff, had been in the French army at the period of its greatest glory, and although he then merely fiUed a subordinate station, he had acquired as thorough a knowledge of the great principles of the art of war as if he had served in the highest rank* The inferior \u2022 Soliman Pacha has now (1839) a high command in the Egyptian army."], [324, "262 SYRIA, character of the Turkish soldiers, and the total want of intelligence in theh chiefs, are circumstances which, it must be admitted, tend to dim the lustre of the achievements of the Egyptian army, for doubtless it was advantageous to Ibrahim to be opposed to troops who are incapable of man\u0153uvring, and whose invariable practice it is, either to await the advance of theh enemy, or to rush forward to attack him without either system or order. On the other hand, however, it is to be remembered that the Egyptian army had also been recently organized, and that the merit of having dis posed of his columns and performed his marches with as much foresight, energy, and skill, as would have been necessary in a contest with more formidable foes, is at least due to Ibrahim Pacha."], [325, "APPENDIX. Observations on the Defences of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. The passage of the Dardanelles is defended by fourteen castles and batteries. Eight of these are on the European and six on the Asiatic shore, the former mounting about 340, and the latter 400 guns. Theh position, as weU as the soundings and the currents, are accurately marked on the Admhalty chart. Some of the works are very formidable as coast defences, such for instance, on the European shore, as SedU-Bahr Kalessi, or the outer castle, which with its redoubt, contains 74 guns and 4 mortars; KUid-Bahr Kalessi, or the inner castle, in which there are 64 guns ; Namasieh, a detached battery of about 300 yards to the west of the castle, mounting 60 guns ; and Bovalh Kalessi, near Sestos, where there are upwards of 50 guns. On the Asiatic side, some of the castles and batteries are armed with a stUl greater number of pieces of ordnance. Thus, the outer castle called Koom Kale, and its dependent batteries, mount at least 80 guns. Sultanieh Kalessi, or the inner castle, and the heavy batteries on either flank, contain no less than 196 guns ; and Nogara Bournou Kalessi, a fort which has a tower in the centre, mounts 84 guns. Formidable as the works on both shores may be against shipping, they present little or no defence towards the country, and are very accessible at the Gorge. If, therefore, an English fleet should, in the present state of these defences, have occasion to force"], [326, "264 APPENDIX. the Dardanelles, it would be desirable to land about two thousand infantry on each shore, to take the forts and batteries in reverse, an operation in which there would be no great difficulty. As an additional means of effecting the intended object, the ships of war should be attended by powerful steamers to tow them through the straits in the event of calms or adverse winds. The distance from shore to shore at the outer castles is about 4300 yards, and therefore the ships would have no difficulty in running through this part of the passage, and they might land the troops on the Asiatic shore, near Barber's Point ; and on the European side, in a smaU bay about a mUe above the castle of Sedil- Bahr. The Bosphorus is merely defended by open batteries, which, though well placed for opposing shipping, are injudiciously constructed for resisting an attack on the land side, being commanded by the heights imme diately in the rear. In short, the defences of this passage are much weaker than those of the Dardanelles, whereas, to be enabled to make an equally effective resistance, they ought to be much more powerful, because the current and prevading winds, which oppose the progress of a fleet approaching Constantinople from the Mediterranean, in the same degree favour ships coming from the Black Sea. It is, therefore, to the Bosphorus that attention should be directed, and we wUl merely observe, that its defences might be rendered formidable at a very smaU expense. Defences of Constantinople. The city of Constantinople is enclosed on the land side by a triple line of walls, and by a ditch of incon siderable depth. The walls, which are lofty, and have"], [327, "APPENDIX. 265 a great command over the country in theh front, are constructed nearly on a straight line, and, with the exception of two or three breaches, are in such repair that they might easily be put into a state to make a stout resistance. They are flanked by numerous towers in stiU better preservation. Beyond the waUs are cypress trees, which, in the event of an attack, might be felled for the purpose of forming a stockade in the ditch. Since the above was written accounts have reached England of the destruction of the Turkish army by that of Mehemet Ali. This disaster, which doubtless was expected, if not deshed, by Russia, wiU once more place the Ottoman Empire at her mercy, unless England and Austria step forward to its rescue by a prompt and decided intervention in the affairs of the East. > As a preliminary measure, it would be wise to deprive Russia of the plea of active interference, by taking steps to prevent the further advance of the Egyptian army : and it is conceived that this might be effected by England alone threatening to destroy the trade of Alexandria, unless the Pacha of Egypt consented to withdraw his troops from the country they have occu pied since the defeat of the Sultan's army. Observations on the Mint of Constantinople. The Mint is considered to be one of the best regu lated estabhshments of this city. The machinery, however, is of a very inferior description, and is enthely worked by hand. The Sultan had it in contemplation to employ Messrs. Maudslay, the celebrated civil engi neers of London, to erect a steam-engine for the purpose of working the machinery of this Mint, but it is N"], [328, "266 APPENDIX. beheved that the project has been abandoned. The nominal chief of the Mint is a Turk, but the operations are conducted by a very clever American. Accounts in Turkey are generaUy kept iu piastres, excepting when the amount is very considerable, in which case it is stated in purses of 500 piastres. The sUver coins are issued from the Mint in bags, or purses, of this amount, and are passed from one merchant to another at the value stated, without being opened. The rate of exchange between England and Turkey is gradually falling; in 1832 a pound sterling was worth only 80 piastres, but its present value is 104. The intrinsic value of the gold coins is a httle under theh nominal value ; but when, in consequence of the lowering of the exchange, their intrinsic and nominal values become equal, they are caUed in, and coins containing more aUoy are substituted. The sUver coins are worth about half of theh nominal value. Table of Turkish Coins SILVER.

II la fait preceder des observations que voici : \" Le Gouvernement Russe vient de publier une declara tion en reponse a la sommation qui lui ont adressee en dernier lieu la France et l'Angleterre, et a laquelle on sait qu'U n'a pas consenti a souscrire. Nous n'avons pas l'intention de rentrer dans l'examen d'arguments refutes a satiete ; nous nous bornerons a quelques observations sur les erreurs nouvelles que cette declaration essaye d'accre diter. \" Et d'abord, le Gouvernement Russe se demande a quel titre l'Angleterre et la France pretendaient exiger l'evaeua tion des Principautes du Danube. Personne n'ignore com bien leur sommation etait sendee en droit ; les Puissances signataires des actes de Vienne l'ont elles-memes reconnue pour teUe. Les Cabinets de Paris et de Londres agissaient, en cette occasion, en vertu des traites, et leur conduite avait l'approbation des autres Gouvernements. \" Comment, dit la declaration du Cabinet Russe, evacuer les Principautes ' sans', que l'ombre meme des conditions auxqueUes l'Empereur avait subordonne la cessation de cette occupation eut ete remplie par le Gouvernement Ottoman ?' Mais les conditions qu'exigeait la Russie etaient manifestement injustes, et la Conference de Vienne avait formeUement consume en ce point le jugement de l'Europe. \" La declaration ajoute que les armees Russes ne pou vaient evacuer les Principautes au fort d'une guerre que le Gouvernement Ottoman, ' avait declaree le premier.' Les roles ne sauraient etre plus etrangement intervertis. L'in- n 2"], [330, "268 APPENDIX. vasion de deux provinces de l'empire Ture etait, aux yeux du monde entier, un acte de guerre. Si Ton a engage la Porte a ne point en faire un cas de guerre, c'est que, malgre le caractere agressif des actes de la Russie, Ton esperait encore de la part de cette Puissance un retour a la modera tion et a l'equite. \" La Russie n'est pas mieux sendee a rejeter sur les deux Puissances Maritimes l'initiative des provocations. C'est une chose jugee ; et puisque le Cabinet de Saint Peters bourg nous rappeUe a ce sujet son memorandum du 18 FeVrier dernier, nous pouvons, a notre tour, la renvoyer a l'ensemble des documents qui, en Angleterre comme en France, ont si bien mis cette question hors de doute, qu'aucun des deux gouvernements n'a cru devoir un instant s'oecuper de ce memorandum tant de fois refute a l'avance. L'initiative des actes de guerre en ce qui concerne la Porte, comme celle des provocations en ce qui touche les Puis sances Maritimes, appartient exclusivemeut a la Puissance qui a envahi les Principautes du Danube ; et tel est l'avis de l'Europe entiere. \" La declaration du Cabinet Russe fait remarquer que l'occupation n'avait point empeche les negociations de s'ouvrir, et queUe n'en eut pas arrete la poursuite, ' si les Puissances n'avaient brusquement, sans raison valable, changl les bases qu'eUes lui avaient elles-memes donnees dans la premiere note concertee a Vienne.' Les Puissances avaient, en effet, pos6 des principes qui, loyalement admis, auraient pu alors resoudre le differend ; mais le commentaii-e que la note dont U s'agit a recu de M. le Comte de jNsessel rode est venu attester que le Cabinet Russe ne les acceptait qu'en y attaebant une signification tres-different de la pens6e de la Conference de Vienne, ainsi que l'ont reconnu tous les Gouvernements representes dans cette Conference. C'est done la Russie eUe-meme qui a change les bases de la nego ciation, et force les grandes Puissances a en rechercher d' autres. \" Le Gouvernement Russe se plaint avec amertume de la sommation que les Cabinets de Paris et de Londres durent"], [331, "APPENDIX. 269 adresser au Commandant-en-chef des forces navales a Sebastopol a, la suite de l'agression de Sinope. Nous recon naissons que cette sommation etait inusitee ; mais eUe etait commandee par une situation qui ne l'etait pas moins ; et ce n'est qu'apres avoir epuise tous les moyens de conciliation qu'une moderation patiente et le sincere desir de la paix pouvaient suggerer, que la France et la Grande-Bretagne ont recouru a cette mesure extreme. \" II est vrai que le Gouvernement Russe essaye d'attenuer la proportion qui ' existe entre les effets et la cause,' ajoutaiit ' que les deux Puissances sont obligees d'en exagerer l'objet en formulant contre la Russie les accusations les plus vagues.' Mais, pour attester la gravite de la cause, nous n'avons besoin que de rappeler les declarations formulees a Vienne dans les actes de la conference ; et quant a l'objet, les reve lations contenues dans les documents Anglais prouvent assez que les accusations de la France et de la Grande- Bretagne sont loin d'etre exageres. \" D'apres la declaration du Cabinet Russe, nous serious moins respectueux que lui-meme pour l'independance de la Porte; et 1'une des preuves qu'il en donne, c'est que le Gouvernement Ottoman a renonce par un traite a faire la paix sans ses aUies. En prenant cet engagement, la Porte ne fait que contracter ime obligation reciproque, sur le pied d'une parfaite egafite et conforme d'ailleurs a l'usage con stant, general, du droit des nations, lorsque plusieurs s'asso cient pour poursuivre par les armes un meme but. \"La Porte, ajoute le Cabinet Russe, va etre forcee de souscrire a un engagement ' qui etendrait a tous ses sujets l'egalite des droits cirils et politiques.' Cette assertion, loin d'etre sendee, nous donne 1' occasion de constater d'une maniere frappante queUe est, entre la Russie et les Puis sances Occidentales, la difference des precedes dans leurs relations avec l'Empire Ottoman. La Russie a pretendu stipuler avec la Porte, soit dans un traite, soit au moyen d'une note, le maintien des libertes des sujets du Sultan. Les autres Puissances n'ont pas eu un seul instant la pensee d'exiger de la Porte un engagement semblable, ni sous"], [332, "270 APPENDIX. forme de traite, ni sous forme de note. EUes n'ont, il est vrai, negfige aucune occasion de suggerer a la Porte les mesures qui leur paraissaient les plus propres a ameliorer la condition des Chretiens de l'Empire Ture ; mais elles n'ont pu songer a restreindre la souverainete du Sultan, lorsque, au contraire, elles s'armaient pour la defendre contre les pretentions qui la menagaient. \" ' C'est a l'Europe, non aux deux Puissances,' continue le Gouvernement Russe, ' de decider si l'equilibre Europeen court effectivement les dangers qu'on pretend deriver pour eUe de l'excessive preponderance attribuee a la Russie.' Sur ce point, le veeu du Cabinet Russe est deja rempli. Ce sont les grandes Puissances de l'Europe, et non la France et l'Angleterre seulement, qui ont signe les actes de Vienne, et ces actes dedarent hautement que la position prise par la Russie sur le Danube met l'equilibre general en peril. \" Selon le Cabinet de Saint Petersbourg, ce seraient au contraire la France et l'Angleterre qui exerceraient au jourd'hui sur l'Europe une pression de nature a inquieter toutes les neutralites. Tout le monde sait cependant que, bien loin de manifester aucune inquietude, les neutres ap plaudissent au contraire a 1' attitude prise par les deux Puis sances Maritimes, et qu'en ce moment meme, de tous les points du monde, ils les remercient de la recente declaration qui vient de consacrer l'ensemble des principes sous lesquels ils avaient cherche vainement jusqu'a ce jour a abriter leur liberte en temps de guerre. \" Enfin le Gouvernement Russe pense que l'isolement ou on veut, dit-il, le jeter, ne serait que livrer le monde a une preponderance plus dangereuse que ne pourrait etre la sienne. Ce Gouvernement oublie qu'aucune des grandes Puissances ne poursuit, comme la Russie, des avantages exclusifs, et ne reclame de role a part. Loin de permettre a une preponderance quelconque de s'etablir, une action com mune s'exercant a quatre est pour tous les Etats un gage de seeurite et d'impartialite. Les influences qui concourent au but que Ton se propose se font un juste contre-poids, et garantissent d'avance a l'Europe que l'interet general qui a"], [333, "APPENDIX. 271 rapproche les quatre Puissances ne cessera pas un instant de dominer leurs resolutions, et sera seul ecouteau denouement. \" On peut juger par les observations qui precedent, de l'esprit du nouveau document publie par le Gouvernement Russe.\" From the \" Times \" ofthe 24. h April, 1854. \" The counter-declaration of the Russian government, in reply to the declaration of war publi shed by the courts of England and France, is a document drawn up with all the astuteness and moderation of tone which the cabinet of St. Petersburg knows how to assume in dealing with the great powers of Europe. It is difficult to imagine a greater con trast than that which exists between the language of this declaration and the insolent terms addressed by Prince Menschikoff to the Porte, or the truculent appeals to the religious fanaticism of the Russian people, or the con temptuous indifference with which the Emperor Nicholas himself spoke to Sir HamUton Seymour of his other allies. Here, on tlie contrary, all is placid, measured, dignified, and resigned, and the only effort made is an appeal to Europe to judge of the services which Russia has rendered to the common interests of all nations. Unhappily for the Russian special pleader, Europe has already recorded its verdict on this very point, and judgment has been entered against the culprit. Those very topics, \u2022 on which, as the declaration truly observes, the resources of polemical writing are ex hausted, have all been deliberately considered, not by Turkey, or by the Western Powers alone, but by the German States and by the public throughout the world, and the result is, that every step taken by England and France has been sanc tioned by the general approval of Europe, and by express protocols signed by those States most nearly connected with Russia herself. There certainly was no predisposition in those countries, or in France, or in the British Government"], [334, "272 APPENDIX. and the reflecting classes of this country, to plunge into a war, which, as the Emperor himself observes, 'judged by the apparent grievances in which it originates, would have no cause of existence.' But what were those apparent grievances or pretexts ? They were the absurd complaints and extra vagant demands which formed the sole materials of Prince Menschikoff's mission, and in which, when they were de tached from the mass of deceit that accompanied them, Europe was unable to discover one single articulate ground of complaint amounting to bad faith or hostility on the side of Turkey. To suppose that the cabinet of St. Petersburg was so short-sighted and infatuated as to expose the Turkish empire to dissolution, and all Europe to the peril of war, merely for the ' apparent grievances ' for which Prince Menschikoff was to obtain redress, is an hypothesis too in consistent with the ability commonly imputed to the Russian Government. No one will credit such a statement, which would imply an extent of blindness amounting to stupidity. Everything proves, on the contrary, that the Emperor had deliberately prepared and collected all his resources for a grand attack on the east of Europe ; that he endeavoured, as long as possible, to mask his design by fair words to the other powers ; but that, at the very moment when he was signing engagements to the British Government to pursue, in common with England, a policy of forbearance and pre servation towards Turkey, his troops wrere on theh way to commence the invasion of the Sultan's dominions. None of the European Governments evinced either jealousy of, or hostility to, the influence of Russia, so long as she confined it within the limits to which she now refers with apparent satisfaction. The successive ministers of this country never hesitated to unite their exertions to hers as long as those exertions were directed to the maintenance of peace and of established rights. But the whole case of the \"Western Powers against Russia on this Turkish question is, that she acted in direct violation of her former policy and pledges. Declaring that the condition of Turkey was extremely pre- carious, and it was indispensably necessary to abstain from"], [335, "273 APPENDIX. harassing the Sultan's Government by vexatious demands, she despatched Prince Menschikoff on his insulting and destructive mission. Professing to abide by the tenor of treaties, she demanded concessions which no treaty con tained, and which, if any treaty had contained them, she need not have demanded. Asserting to the last her pacific intentions, she gave the signal of actual war by the armed seizure of two provinces of adjacent territory. That these acts were not instant causes of war arose chiefly from the surprise, and even incredulity of Europe, as to the intentions they disclosed. They were met by negotiation, in the hope that negotiation would avert the more fatal consequences of such an aggression. Had no ulterior intentions existed, those negotiations must have proved successful ; but the spirit with which they were carried on by Russia was deci sively proved by the fact that the very last propositions brought to Vienna by Count Orloff were an aggravation of the Menschikoff Note, and were therefore summarily rejected by the Vienna Conference, on the motion of Count Buol, the Austrian minister. \" The Russian Government refers, in more than one passage of this manifesto, to the isolated position in which it is placed, and it insinuates that the maintenance of its influence in Europe is ' not more essential to the Russian nation than it is to the maintenance of order and security in other states.' The Emperor is evidently unwilling to relinquish that species of protectorate which he has aspired to exercise for the last few years, not over the Christians of Turkey alone. There is, however, a startling audacity in the assertion that ' this influence of Russia is essential to the maintenance of order and security in other states ' at the very moment when the influence of Russia has undoubtedly thrown the east of Europe into the con vulsions of anarchy and the horrors of war. It is not in Turkey that the influence of Russia has produced these salutary fruits, though even there the Emperor does not scruple to boast of treaties, such as those of Adrianople and Unkiar Skelessi, as proofs of his zeal in saving the"], [336, "274 APPENDIX. Ottoman empire. Nor is it in England, or even in France, that we have yet learnt to look to Russian influence for the maintenance of order and security. It must be, therefore, to the German Powers that this taunt is addressed, for it is there, as we are told in a former part of this declaration, that the Emperor has exerted his authority to restore harmony between tbe principal governments, and to pre serve the balance of power by the defence of their domi nions. If the object of Russia is to conciliate the good wiU, or to regain the confidence of those states, whom she no longer speaks of in this document as her allies, the moment is iU chosen to remind them of services rendered under totaUy different circumstances, and to assert that the maintenance of order and security in their dominions depends on the countenance that they may receive from St. Petersburgh. The Emperor of Austria has taken other means to show, within the last few days, that he relies on no such foreign support. The state of martial law which had existed in Hungary, Gallicia, and the other eastern provinces of the monarchy since the revolution, has now been definitely raised, and the punishments of many persons condemned for political offences have been commuted. The marriage of the young Emperor Francis Joseph wiU be celebrated at Vienna this day with a Princess of the House of Bavaria, whom he has selected, without the usual for malities of an Imperial courtship, to share the honours and cares of his reign. The Court and the people of Austria receive with unaffected enthusiasm this omen of a more prosperous future, although the political horizon darkens round Europe ; and we cannot but esteem it a fortunate circumstance that a Prince of the Royal f'amUy of England, now on his way to command a division of the British forces sent against Russia in the East, should be the bearer of the good wishes of Her Majesty, and of this country, to the Emperor of Austria and his bride on such an occasion. And if we may form a wish for the ' mainte nance of order and security ' in that empire, we are satis fied that the noblest and most politic mode of celebrating"], [337, "APPENDIX. 275 festivities of this nature is by a liberal act of oblivion over past dissensions, and by an amnesty to many of the unhappy victims of revolution and civil war, which we trust will form part of the solemnities and rejoicings of this day. The treaty just signed between Austria and Prussia at Berlin puts an end to the divided and conflicting action of the German states, and may enable both of them to con sider more freely the position in which they stand to theh own countrymen and to Russia. Theh opinion on the great political question which now agitates the world is distinctly recorded in the Protocols of Vienna, some of them signed at a very recent date. The Declaration of Russia leaves no ground open to the surmise or the pretence that she contemplates the evacuation of the Principalities or the termination of this contest by any other means than by force of arms. The neutral States have certainly not been ' subjected to the pressure of a formidable alliance, which alternately employs its caresses and threats ' \u2014 for the whole conduct of the neutral States has been, and stiU is, free and independent. It is of their own deliberate choice and will that Austria and Prussia have signed the Vienna Protocols, and even approved the summons which Russia conceives to be so insulting to her dignity. We rely for the support of the neutral States on the justice of our cause, on the uprightness of our intentions, and on the universal interest of mankind in the speedy restoration of peace. Here is a war, even by the evidence of its author, begun without a cause; and it is to be hoped that the mutual confidence and common interests of Europe wiU find means to terminate a contest of such incalculable injury to the world. But this result is not now to be obtained, as the King of Prussia seems to imagine, by idle attempts at mediation, but by a firm and manly adoption of those principles by which alone the peace and independence of Europe can be secured.\" J*EIHTEn B- BABE-SON ABD SOBS, LONUOB GAZETTl* oy-lCE, ST.
