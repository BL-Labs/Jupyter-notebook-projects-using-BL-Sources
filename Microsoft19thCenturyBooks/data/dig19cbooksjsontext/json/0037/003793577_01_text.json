JUDE'S, CHELSEA, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE ROYAL POLYTECHNIC. Prob.vblt there never yet has started any prima facie unobjectionable mode of public entertainment and im provement which so rapidly and so extensively caught the fancy, and secured the patronage, of all classes in Great Britain as the Penny Readings. In cities, and towns, and villages alike, the project spread with electric speed, and thousands through its means have discovered they could read, and tens of thousands have found they could not, though they had always taken it for granted they could, till they tried, made a botch of it, and failed. Middle-aged and respectable men have cut themselves to school again to learn to read, from having discovered at the Penny Reading the difference between elocution and a drawl, or a twang. A valu able, as well as seasonable auxiliary to the carrying out the plan of these readings is the very judicious publica tions of Mr. H. A. Viles, now submitted for the use of such societies. I do not hesitate to recommend the adoption of these compilations as suitable and con venient books, at a moderate price, which renders the \u2022'Imperial Speaker\" and \" The Orator \" accessible to all classes. Their specimens of our chief English writers are well chosen and sufficiently copious for variety; their size makes them easily portable as pocket companions for the use of those who might wish to read up and study beforehand, at odd times, and fragments of leisure, such extracts as they may afterwards read with increased ease and efficiency at the public meetings ; and also for those who merely at tend as auditors, that, with the book in their hands, they may accompany the reader, and mark his points of em phasis and inflection, and so be better able to judge of the author's meaning, a3 expounded by his reader. I have not yet met with any collections of equal merit to these of Mr. Viles, whether in point of cost, discriminate selections, or easy type for reading aloud in public. \u25a0 With reference to Penny Readings generally, con sidered in the abstract, they are calculated to improve alike the readers and their auditors; but a few werds of friendly caution and suggestion will not be taken amiss from an old caterer for the rational and innocent amusement of the people. For nearly forty years I have been in the habit of ministering my humble quota to these various schemes to elevate the morals, improve the taste, develope the intelligence, and supply the reasonable demand for entertainment for the people. Perhaps I have thereby gathered some ex perience which may be useful to younger labourers. I shall attempt no particular order or method in sub mitting a few hints on the style of elocution and the selection of subjects for the Penny Readings, but throw them out as they occur to me. We may consider \u2014 1st, the readers; 2nd, the things read; 3rd, the time and place of reading. I. \u2014 Readers should be all who can road, and nona who cannot. All denominations of Christians, and all classes of society, and all shades of politics \u2014 so that the individual character be not immoral \u2014 should be welcome to a trial reading before a Committee of Approval before making any public effort, because a failure should be as private as possible, not only for the individual feelings, but for the effect on the public. It is most undesirable that bad reading should expose the system to ridicule and contempt. It would degenerate the meeting into a farce\u2014 minister to mental discord and ill-will among neighbours, and subvert the design of such institutions, which is to promote social harmony, co-operation, and the general improve ment of tho moral and intellectual status of a locality. No individual should be asked to read simply on account of his station or influence in the neighbour hood, unless he were known to possess some reasonable amount of qualification. A repetition of such a mistake would disgust and drive away competent persons, and paralyse the public interest in the experiment. I heard of a wealthy, and, in his way, worthy old Mushroom offer ing his services to assist on such an occasion, who read Hamlet's famous soliloquy in this fashion : \u2014 \"Toby or not\u2014 Toby\" \u2014 (evidently calling the dog). \"That is the question\" (i.e., Toby was). \"Whether it is nobbier in the mind \" (as if it might be nobler some where else, as in the elbows or trousers pocket) \" to bear the slings of outragehousefortun'.hor, by hopposin, hend them \" At which point in the hypothesis the unrestrainable laughter of his audience ended him. It is as well not to put in foreigners, whose patois, except in suitable and humorous pieces, renders patho. or sublimity impracticable. Fancy a Frenchman, wholly unconscious of his blunders, seriously render ing Byron's charade on the letter H in this wise :\u2014"], [12, "ESSAY, II II.\u2014 The things read should not be characterised by any weary sense of sameness in any kind of hteratu.ro. They need not be all serious, as if there was nothing profitable and recreating except sermons ; nor should they be all humorous, as if the main object of the Readings wa3 to provoke laughter ; nor all prose, nor all poetry, nor all of anything. A judicious miscellany, alternating on successive evenings fiction with history, poetry with prose, science with philosophy, politics with morals, humour with pathos \u2014 as it is in real life \u2014 and, in fair proportion, the ancient with the modern, would gradually familiarise the local public with some of the best specimens of English writers of every age, and of every class. The readings would becomo a practical index to the volumes whence the extracts were taken, and on some minds would operate as a finger-post to induce their further travelling that way. 44 It va.3 vispared in Heavain, it vas moottared in ale, And echo cote sofetly de sound as It fail.\" Those readers who prove the most effective should be the most frequently set on, aud, of course, the less successful as neldom invited. The humble but respectable ambition to shine, to be agreeable and use ful among their friends and neighbours would operate as a stimulus to study the art, and thereby multiply pro ficients in it. Except for these Penny Readings, there are few public opportunities for exercising the gift, since it is a very different thing to read in private. The nervousness of addressing public assemblies, even from a book, can only be mastered by public practice. There are far more good musicians than good readers, simply because there are more opportunities of exercise for the former than for the latter, and because the discords, mistakes, and inefficiency in playing a tune are more palpable, though scarcely less disagreeable, than in reading a tale. But as the secret of accurate and finished music lies in the amount of the per former's private practice on the instrument, so the same rule applies to perfect reading. Demosthenes practised oratory with noisy and insensible waves for his auditors. The student of the art of reading should possess himself of some good book on elocution, get up thoroughly the rules, then read aloud, just as musical pupils play aloud, some hour or more daily, to imaginary audiences, and it won't bo long before he acquires the power to charm real ones. Roading well and effectively is a rare and delightful talent, yet one within reach of every man who sets his faco againsl lisping, stuttering, drawling, droning, aheniing and ahaing. The only marvel is, how any class of men whose business it is to road in public, can be so blind to their duty to their hearers, as not to take the requisite pains to enable them to do their work with the decency of proper effect. There aro some public readers who seem as dead to the sense of what they read, as iheir hearers are to their mechanical reading, and it might be hard to decide to which of tho parties the perform ance was the greater bore. If nature has not given a man a tolerable voice, or if habit has invested him with a snuffle, a stutter, or a lisp (that tongue-tied infirmity which is Nature's hint to him to hold his peace), such men's overtures should be courteously declined. Why should you allow them to exposo them selves to ridicule simply because they did not know they were ridiculous ? If they are not aware of their impediments, keep the public equally innocent of the annoyance ; it is the greater kindness to both parties. At the same time, be careful not to discourage a fair supply of volunteers. Penny Readings must chiefly, if not in most cases exclusively, depend upon gratuitous performances. Hence tolerate all deficiencies which are not absolutely intolerable. Let the chairman on each occasion be tho mouthpiece to communicato any suggestions addressed to tho readers, not individually, but in a mass, at the close of the sederunt, thus avoid ing personality, yet not missing the opportunity for somo instruction to both readers aud hearers. After all, this meeting should be rogarded as a kind of night school for practice in elocution, and consequently the reader's faults should be kindly indicated, while, at the same time, skill and effectshouldbe Iiberallycommended. Without groat caution, the Penny Readings will become mere electioneering tools in the hands of local leaders, to bring to bear a partizan influence on the neighbourhood. This would rapidly wind them up without ' an order in Chancery.' The real usefulness of the effort in that vicinity would be compromised so soon a3 it was seen that readers, in their choice of subjects, were not influenced by a desire to raise the mental standard of the neighbourhood, but were in- directly canvassing for votes, no matter on what side of politics. It would be a man\u0153uvre equally unworthy on any side. The same objection lies against any denomi- national bias being attempted through this medium. Re- ligious doctrines should be spared the indignity of being foisted on an audience in an underhand way, like a conjuring trick, or a trade advertisement. Moral truth needs no chicanery, nor should its advocate expose its sacred interests to the reception of a charlatan. Nevor- tneless, Committees of Management should take care that religion and morality were not altogether excluded under a specious plea of catholic neutrality. Once let infidelity get in the wedge of irroligion, through a spurious profession of impartiality, and Penny Read- ings would sink at once into night-schools of unbelief, and masked batteries of constructive assault on the foundations of our common Christianity. We should be unconsciously playing the game of the impugners of Revelation, who, with a show of liberality, would gladly co-operate with us, at the same time laughing in their sleeves at our blindfold co-operation with them, by this systematic shelving of the scriptures. To obviate this mischief, at lea3t one portion of the sacred literature of the prophets or apostles should be read on every occasion, as an act of filial homage to the Holy Book, and as a sprinkling of salt upon every sacrifice on the altar of public taste arjd teaching, lest in their mirth they should forget God. Judgment is requisite in the choice of the individnal reader, as well as in the por- tions to bo read. No book in the world contains speci- mens anything so fine of the loftiest typo of poetry, enigma, narrative, biography, dramatic dialogue oratory, and argument as the Bible. Carefully selected' an extract each night from these contents of scripture would harmonise admirably with any properly-arranged series to follow or precede it; and if the scriptural selections could not so harmonise with the secular it"], [13, "ESSAY. III would only prove the latter were themselve3 at fault, and would all the more justify the introduction of a test which detected the anomaly. Too much humour reduces the Readings to a farce \u2014 too much seriousness confounds them with a place of worship. Now, people do not come to the Readings with the same feelings with which they visit a theatre, or attend a church. They partake rather of the tone of the cheerful family circle than of either one or the other ; and this fea ture sliould be carefully, and may be very easily, maintained by a little exercise of firmness and discre tion on the part of the Committee of Management. The popularity of the scheme will be more permanent, and its usefulness in raising the moral and intellectual tone of society better secured, by adhering strictly to the rule of variety of authors. I have no objection to a fair percentage of Dickens, Thackeray, Tom Hood, and others, among recent humorists ; and of Theodore Hook, Sheridan, Fielding, and others, among elder writers of the same class ; but let the graver authors have a fair hearing. If it be all comedy, you only succeed in suggesting the theatre, where it is done better such as it is ; and I presume such a result is not the object of the promoters of such gatherings of neighbour:). Their motive should be to intercept the tippler on his way to the tavern by the offer of a more rational and elevating evening's entertainment, and to compete with the strolling dramatic corps by a more innocent and less perilous pastime. Nor should the instructional element be lost sight of, though it neod not be ostensible. You will get a larger class of invo luntary pupilB by giving them their lesson unawares. Some recent novelists have given themselves more credit than anyone else endorses, by the sneering avowal that their works pretend no moral, nor any particular teaching of any kind \u2014 that they wrote purely for amusement. They have not succeeded, even in their own view, as much as thoy probably flatter themselvos ; and if they had, so much the more dis creditable to them, as men abusing the influence with which the public patronage made them responsible. Once let Penny Readings be conducted on the mere amusement principle, and they sink into the grade of Penny Gaffs, only that their amateur performers seek applause instead of pay, and a weekly gratification of their vanity, instead of a scarcely less vulgar weekly subsistence. Further, I strongly deprecate the selec tion of even harmless paragraphs from notorious in fidel writers. I heard, in a Midland town, of the clergy and other ministers of religion, together with most of the serious patrons of their Penny Readings, formally abandoning connection with them, because Shelley and Tom Paine had been chosen among the authors for the evening. Why should the Penny Readings be a means of advertising such writings? Is English literature so scanty that an abundant supply of first-rate materials to occupy the evenings cannot be found without having recourse to the profane, how ever finished, ribaldry of infidel publications such as these? To select such writers is an ignorant affront to others who are postponed to them, and a surrepti tious introduction of the free-thinking element into publicity, which would disgust and forfeit the confi dence of every right-minded supporter of the move- ment. It would soon render the Penny Readings more objectionable than the Penny Theatres\u2014 for, with all the vice and immorality incidental to the latter, direct, avowed infidelity forms no foul item of their attrac tions ; but if tho former set them the example, it is hard to conjecture to what lengths the vicious com petition might not drive their more vulgar competi tors. By all means let there be plenty of fun intermingled with the evening's series. Give your audiences as much merry laughing as they like ; \u2014 it doe3 mea good. There is something, to my mind, most affecting in the downright hoarty laugh of a poor struggling artisan who has been toiling from morn to dewy eve, his serious face bent earnestly for ten or twelve hours over the job, his execution of which involves his credit as a workman and the daily bread of his family. To ease awhile that man's shoulders of at least thoir mental burthen by the new current of thought set in by the wit and humour of the author who is being read to him \u2014 to light up that pale, weary face with the unwonted life and beauty of a smile, and that smile the index of an intelligent appreciation of the genius which evoked it \u2014 is a spectacle worth some pain3 to compass. But let the fun be mixed up with fact \u2014 with information \u2014 with something solid. The solid episodes will all the better complete the picture of life a3 it is, with its alternations of light and shade, joys and sor rows, pleasantries and pains, makebelieves and earnest things. III. Once more, as to time andplace for holding such meetings. They should be held at night, as the only season of leisure to attend for most classes \u2014 not later than from seven to nine, to secure early getting homo \u2014 not oftener than once a fortnight, or they wear out their novelty and attraction too soon \u2014 nor on the same nights as the weekly religious services of the neigh bourhood \u2014 nor, of course, under any circumstances or pretence, on the Sabbath \u2014 nor in the summer season, when the people are better and more healthily em ployed in their bits of gardens, or in out-of-door recrea tions. Then the place of meeting should be the Com mon Hall of a town, if there be one ; and if not, the best and most commodious to be had at a moderate expense, always excepting the club-room of a public house. Instances have often occurred of a consider able body of the attendants at a Penny Reading held at an Inn stopping after tho close of the evening to squander the re3t of tho night in a drunken carouse. Now one object of the Readings is to draw away the mechanic and labouring class from the excess and de moralising associations of the tap-room; but to hold the meeting on such premises looks like a contradic tion, and is an indirect way of leading men within the sphere of their influence. It is building up with the right hand, and pulling down with the left. Neither is a church or a chapel a suitable place for such meet ings. A roar of laughter sounds like an irreverent discord in the aisles attuned to the hymn of praise. Equally undesirable i3 the local theatre. Better far a school-room, or any like indifferent spot, without any particular associations out of harmony with the pro ceedings. With moderate care and attention to these and othei"], [14, "ESSAY. IV phony, it is an easy, insidious step into popular sym- pathy for the habit. Sober, earnest men will decline co-operation with such careless mismanagement, \" lest they should be partakers of other men's sins.\"_ Bacchus may have survived his old pagan contemporaries by his incidental alliteration with the vulgar vernacular of \"baccy,\" and thereby perpetuated a nominal and real association with drink; but your quiet, respectable neighbours deprecate the low idolatry, nor will they suffer themselves to be numbered among the Baeeha- nals, in whatever subtle shape it may be tried by the \" old serpent who deceiveth the world.\" Consequently, if the Penny Readings are to succeed, they must de- serve success by their honest, uniform pursuit of a good end by fair means. If, on the other hand, they are conducted in a loose, indefinite way, with no sys- tem, except a systematic exclusion of everything sensible and solid, and thereby the evenings become a series of bad farces and inferior Penny Gaffs, they are as great if not a greater mischief and nuisance, as being more extensively patronised than their publican com- petitors. If the audience which applauds to the echo a succession of broad comical pieces won't tolerate a magnificent episode of history, or a brilliant burst of political, sacred, or philosophic oratory, or some well- chosen extract of English poetry, the sooner that society reconstructs its arrangements, the better for the credit of its managers, and for the interests of its hearers. Such as it is, it is not philanthropy \u2014 it is not even common sense ; it is an involuntary imposition, if not a disingenuous trick of the secularists, to countermine the influence of more serious and consistent instru- ments of social improvement. Let no man sneer at these suggestions as so many preachments, though, if they were, I have at least as good a right to preach my say, as they have to prattle theirs. But I have pur- posely abstained from preaching on this theme. It is not a directly sacred, but a social, project ; only we are not to be gulled into playing the devil's game under a plea of popular amusement. We of my way of think- ing contend it is perfectly practicable to attract and entertain mixed audiences, without compromising a single genuine feature of our common Christianity, and that wherever that proposition is practically ignored by an exclusive employment of the Penny Readings, in mere humour and sing-song, the object which Christian I men and women should have in view is altogether frustrated, and a mischievous deceit, whether inten- tional or not, is palmed upon the public. If my words have any weight, I strongly advise all real friends of the people to insist upon a steady adherence to some such plan of conducting Penny Readings, as sketched out in the foregoing remarks, now respectfully submitted to their consideration. If they should be out-voted by the numerical strength of the secular party, they have no alternative left, except to separate themselves from what is evil, simply because it is sen- sual \u2014 not only to avoid complicity with the offence, but to \"keep themselves pure.\" Subject, nevertheless, to n, fair division of the grave with the gay, and the didactic with the diverting, Penny Readings may be- come useful and loyal handmaids in the noble enter prise of exalting the popular taste for whatsoever things are of good report, lovely, and true. details of management, the Penny Readings may be made most effective. They are a return to the old method of instructing a people through the medium of their amusements, after the manner of the ancient Bards, who sang to them their legends and historical traditions, accompanying them with their harps, in stead of, since the invention of printing, with books. It is making a book go further than its ordinary pub lication. It is the voice of the reader multiplying the type of the printer. It is the schoolmaster abroad \u2014 the readers scattering broadcast the thoughts of their authors on school-classes of which the public are the pupils and the place of meeting the school-house. It spreads a taste for something bettor than the ribald songs of the beershop. The Pandean pipes of our fine old English poets eclipse the pipes of tobacco; \"the Pierean spring \" inundates, as with a flood that fer tilises what before were barren wastes, tap-rooms and ale-cellars; and the spirit of the Drama insensibly diverts the sordid craving after the spirit of the dram. Amid the whole of the works selected for perusal, the infusion of a religious element pervades the Readings like a healthy atmosphere within whose bright and clear horizon nothing is visible that is in any way ob jectionable, or obstructive to the moral view. On this account, it is well to avoid reading those humorous descriptions of a drunken man which insensibly dimi nish one's disgust at the degrading spectacle, whereby vice purloins an indirect sympathy through its appa rent alliance with fun and good-fellowship. The advice, \" Let it not be so much as named among you,\" applies as forcibly to this sin as to any other infringe ment of the rules of propriety and virtue. If Bacchus still has his poets-laureate, let him keep them to him self \u2014 restrict them and their stanzas to the night cellars. Admit no writer to participate in your sober \" feast of reason and flow of soul \" without \" the wedding garment \" of social virtue and decency. Nor waste the time of the meeting and the opportunity for improvement, by too much of what schoolboys call \"nonsense verses.\" Give them plenty of wit and humour, but let the grave and instructive have their turn. The introduction of music, vocal and instru mental, where it can be tolerably got up, is always popu lar, and helps to enhance the choral power of the vicinity. Besides, the working man is soothed by the influence of music, and the \" concord of sweet sounds.\" Jabal the father of herdsmen, had for his brothers Jubal, who was father of music, and Tubal-Cain, the founder of the founderies, to intimate the good old rule of harmony existing between the pastures and the manufactures, and that the toils of industry should be cheered and alleviated by the charms of minstrelsy. So deep an instinct is the love of melody in the labourer's heart, that the syren note of tho ale-house lures him, like a bugle-call, to \" its nest of unclean ness,\" if there be no chaster strains to woo him into better company. Then, by all means, mingle music with your libretto, and both will be all the better for the light of each other's countenance. At tho same time, let the principle of selection, as to what is read, equally apply to what is sung. If the praises of the pipe and foaming bowl, and a quasi-pagan glorification of rippling and toasting bo tho themes of choral sym-"], [15, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER.

[The writings of this distinguished author have been almost universally admitted to be unrivalled, and a careful perusal of them will ever contribute alike to the gratification and to the Improvement of the reader. Burns has said: 44The earliest composition that I recollect taking any delight in was (the extract we have here chosen, entitled) 4 The Vision of Mirza.' \" And Dr. Johnson pays a still higher compliment to the genius of this great man. He Bays : \" Whoever wishes to attain an English style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious, must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.\" Indeed, their high moral tone and classic elegance render them an appropriate source from which to select the mOBt delightful Headings for the People.] \"I see a bridge,\" said I, \" standing in the midst of the tide.\" \" The bridge thou seest,\" said he, \" is human life ; con sider it attentively.\" Upon a more leisurely survey of it, I found that it con sisted of threescore and ten entire arches, with several broken arches, which, added to those that were entire, made up the number about an hundred. As I was counting the arches, the genius told me that this bridge consisted at first of a thousand arches ; but that a great flood swept away the rest, and left the bridge in the ruinous condition I now beheld it. THE VISION OF MIRZA. On the fifth day of the moon, which, according to the custom of my forefathers, I always kept holy, after hav ing washed myself, and offered up my morning devotions, I ascended the high hills of Bagdad, in order to pass the rest of the day in meditation and prayer. As I was here airing myself on the top of the mountains, I fell into a profound contemplation on the vanity of human life ; and passing from one thought to another, \" Surely,\" said 1, \" man is but a shadow, and life a dream.\" Whilst I was thus musing, I cast my eyes towards the summit of a rock that was not far from me, where I discovered one in the habit of a shepherd, with a musical instrument in his hand. As I looked upon him he applied it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The sound of it was exceed ing sweet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpressibly melodious, and altogether different from anything I had ever heard. They put me in mind of those heavenly airs that are played to the departed souls of good men upon their first arrival in Paradise, to wear out the impressions of their last agonies, and qualify them for the pleasures of that happy place. My heart melted away in secret rapture. \"But tell me further,\" said he, \"what thou discoverest on it.\" \" I see multitudes of people passing over it,\" said I, \" and a black cloud hanging on each end of it.\" As I looked more attentively, I saw several of the pas sengers dropping through the bridge into the great tide that flowed underneath it ; and, upon further examination, perceived there were innumerable trap-doors that lay con cealed in the bridge, which the passengers no sooner trod upon, but they fell through them into the tide, and im mediately disappeared. These hidden pit-falls were set very thick at the entrance of the bridge, so that throngs of people no sooner broke through the cloud, but many of them fell into them. They grew thinner towards the middle, but multiplied and lay closer together towards the end of the arches that were entire. There were indeed some persons, but their numbers were very small, that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tired and spent with so long a walk. . I passed some time in the contemplation of this won- derful structure, and the great variety of objects which it presented. My heart was filled with a deep melancholy to see several dropping unexpectedly in the midst of mirth and jollity, and catching at everything that stood by them to save themselves. Some were looking upwards towards the heavens in a thoughtful posture, and in the ' midst of a speculation stumbled and fell out of sight. Multitudes were very busy in the prospect of bubbles that glittered in their eyes, and danced before them, but often when they thought themselves within the reach of them, their footing failed, and down they sank. In this con- fusion of objects I observed some with scimitars in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and fro upon the bridge, thrusting several persons on trap-doors, which did not seem to lie in their way, and which they might have escaped, had they not thus been forced upon them. The genius seeing me indulge myself in this melan- choly prospect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it. \" Take thine eyes off the bridge,\" said he, \" and tell me if thou yet seest anything thou dost not comprehend.\" I kad often been told that the rock before me was the haunt of a genius ; and that several had been entertained with music who had passed by it, but never heard that the musician had before made himself visible. When ho had raised my thoughts by those transporting airs which he played, to taste the pleasures of his conversation, as I looked upon him like one astonished, he beckoned to me, and by the waving of his hand directed me to approach the place where he sat. I drew near with that reverence which is due to a superior nature ; and as my heart was entirely subdued by the captivating strains I had heard, I fell down at his feet and wept. The genius smiled upon me with a look of compassion and affability that familiarised him to my imagination, and at once dispelled all my fears and apprehensions with which I approached him. He lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, \" Mirza,\" said he, \" I have heard thee in thy soliloquies ; follow me.\" He then led me to the highest pinnacle of the rock, and placed me on the top of it. Upon looking up, \"What mean,\" said I, \"those great flights of birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge, and settling upou it, from time to time ? I see vultures, harpies, ravens, cormorants, and, among many \" Cast thine eyes eastward,\" said he, \" and tell me what thou seest.\" \" I see,\" said I, \" a huge valley, and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it.\" No. 41."], [16, "VI THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER.

Pkingle. I sat at noontide in my tent, And look'd across the Desert dun, That 'neath the cloudless firmament Lay gleaming in the sun, When from the bosom of the waste A swarthy stripling came in haste, With foot unshod and naked limb, And a tame springbok following him. I here fetched a deep sigh. \" Alas,\" said I, \" man was made in vain ! How is he given away to misery and mortality, tortured in life, and swallowed up in death !\" The genius being moved with compassion towards me, bid me quit so uncomfortable a prospect. \" Look no more,\" said he, \" on man iu the first stage of his existence, in his setting out for eternity ; but cast thine eye on that thick mist into which the tide bears the several generations of mortals that fall into it.\" I directed my sight as I was ordered, and (whether or no the good genius strengthened it with any supernatural force, or dissipated part of the mist that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I saw the valley opening at the further end, and spreading forth into an immense ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through the midst of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The clouds still rested on one half of it, insomuch that I could discover nothing in it ; but the other appeared to me a vast ocean planted with innumerable islands that were covered with fruits and flowers, and interwoven with a thousand little shining seas that ran among them. I could see persons dressed in glorious habits, with gar lands upon their heads, passing among the trees, lying down by the sides of fountains, or resting on beds of flowers ; and could hear a confused harmony of singing birds, falling waters, human voices, and musical instru ments. Gladness grew in me upon the discovery of so delightful a scene. I wished for the wings of an eagle, that I might fly away to those happy seats. But the genius told me there was no passage to them except through the gates of death that I saw opening every moment upon the bridge. \" The islands,\" said he, \" that lie so fresh and green be fore thee, and with which the whole face of the ocean appears spotted as far as thou canst see, are more in num ber than the sands of the sea-shore. There are myriads of islands behind those which thou here discoverest, reaching farther than thine eye or even thine imagination can extend itself. These are the mansions of good men after death, who according to the degree and kinds of virtue in which they excelled, are distributed among these several islands, which abound with pleasures of different kinds and degrees, suitable to the relishes and perfections of those who are settled in them: every island is a Paradise accommodated to its respective inhabitants. Are not these, oh Mirza ! habitations worth contending for? Does life appear miserable, that gives thee oppor- tunites of earning such a reward ? Is death to bo feared, that will convey thee to so happy an existence ? Think not man was made in vain, who has such an eternity re- served for him.\" He came with open aspect bland, And modestly before me stood, Caressing with a kindly hand That fawn of gentle brood ; Then, meekly gazing in my face, Said in the language of his race, With smiling look, yet pensive tone, \" Stranger, I'm in the world alone !\" \" Poor boy,\" I said, \" thy kindred's home, Beyond far Stormberg's ridges blue, Why hast thou left so young, to roam This desolate Karroo ?\" The smile forsook him while I spoke ; And when again he silence broke, It was with many a stifled sigh He told this strange, sad history. \" I have no kindred !\" said the boy ; \" The Bergenaars, by night they came, And raised their murder-shout of joy, While o'er our huts the flame Rush'd like a torrent ; and their yell Peal'd louder as our warriors fell In helpless heaps beneath their shot. One living man they left us not ! \" The slaughter o'er, they gave the slain To feast the foul-beak'd birds of prey ; And with our herds across the plain They hurried us away \u2014 The widow'd mothers and their brood; Oft, in despair, for drink and food We vainly cried ; they heeded not, But with sharp lash the captives smote. \" Three days we track'dthat dreary wild, Where thirst and anguish press'd us sore And many a mother and her child Lay down to rise no more ; Behind us, on the desert brown, We saw the vultures swooping down ; And heard, as the grim light was falling, The gorged wolf to his comrade calling'. \"At length was heard a river sounding Midst that dry and dismal land. And, like a troop of wild deer bounding, We hurried to its strand ; Among the madden'd cattle rushing, The crowd behind still forward pushing, Till in the flood our limbs were dreneh'd, And the fierce rage of thirst was quench'd. I gazed with inexpressible pleasure on these happy islands. At length said I : \" Show me now, I beseech thee, the secrets that lie hid under these dark clouds which cover tho ocean on the other side of the rock of adamant.\" The genius making me no answer, I turned about to address myself to him a second time, but I found that he had left me ; I then turned again to tho vis ion which I had been so leng contemplating, but instead of the roll ing tide, the arched bridge, and the happy islands, I saw nothing but the long, hollow Valley of Bagdad, with oxen, sheep and camels grazing upon the sides of it. \" Hoarse-roaring, dark, the broad Gareep In turbid streams was sweeping fast, Huge sea-cows iu its eddies deep Loud snorting as wo pass'd ; But that relentless robber clan * Right through those waters wild and wan Drove on like sheep our captive host, Nor stayed to rescue wretches lost."], [17, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. VII \" AU shivering from the foaming flood, We stood upon the stranger's ground, When, with proud looks and gestures rude, The white men gather'd round ; And there, like cattle from the fold, By Christians we were bought and sold, Midst laughter loud and looks of scorn, \u2014 And roughly from each other torn. \" High swelled my heart ! But, when the star Of midnight gleam'd, I softly led My bounding favourite forth, and far Into the desert fled.

[The history of Rob Roy is sufficiently known ; his grave is near the head of Loch Katrine, in one of those small, pinfold-like burial-grounds, of neglected and desolate appearance, whioh the traveller meets with in the Highlands of Scotland.} Oh, English grief ! thou ne'er canst know The injured bondman's bitter woe, When round his heart, like scorpions, cling Black thoughts, that madden while they sting ! A famous man is Robin Hood, The English ballad -singer's joy ! \" Yet this hard fate I might have borne, And taught in time my soul to bend, And Scotland has a thief as good, An outlaw of as daring mood ; Had my sad yearning breast forlorn But found a single friend : She has her brave Rob Roy ! Then clear the weeds from off his gravo, And let us chant a passing stave My race extinct or far removed, In honour of that hero brave ! The boor's rough brood I could have loved\u2014 But each to whom my bosom turn'd Heaven gave Rob Roy a dauntless heart, And wondrous length and strength of arm : Even like a hound the black boy spurn'd 1 \" While friendless thus, my master's flocks 1 tended on the upland waste, Nor craved he more to quell his foes, Or keep his friends from harm. It chanced this fawn leapt from the rocks, By wolfish wild-dogs chased ; Yet was Rob Roy as wise as brave \u2014 Forgive me if the phrase be strong ;\u2014 I rescued it, though wounded sore, All dabbled with its mother's gore, And nursed it in a cavern wild Until it loved me like a child. A poet worthy of Rob Roy Must scorn a timid song. Say, then, that he was wise as brave \u2014 As wise in thought as bold in deed ; \"Gently I nursed it ; for I thought For in the principles of things He sought his moral creed.

One creature lived to love me still, Although its dark and dazzling eye Beam'd not with human sympathy. Said generous Rob, \" What need of books ? Burn all the statutes and their shelves ; They stir us up against our kind, And worse, against ourselves. \" We have a passion, make a law, Too false to guide us or control ! \" Thus lived I, a lone orphan lad, My task the proud boor's flocks to tend ; And this pet fawn was all I had To love, or call my friend ; When, suddenly, with haughty look And taunting words, that tyrant took My playmate for his pamper'd boy, Who envied me my only joy. And for the law itself we fight In bitterness of soul. \" And, puzzled, blinded thus, we lose Distinctions that are plain and few ; These find I graven on my heart : T/iat tells me what to do."], [18, "THE IMPEKiAL SPEAKER.

The young Ginevra was his all in life, Still as she grew, for ever in his sight ; And in her fifteenth year became a bridf, Marrying an only son, Francesco Doria, Her playmate from her birth, and her first love. Just as she looks there in her bridal dress, She was all gentleness, all gaiety ; If thon shouldst ever come, by choice or chance, To Modeua, where still religiously Among her ancient trophies is preserved Bologna's bucket (in its chain it hangs' Within that reverend tower, the Guirlandine), Stop at a Palace near the Reggio-gate, Dwelt in of old by one of the Orsini. Its noble gardens, terrace above terrace, Its sparkling fountains, statues, cypresses, Will long detain thee ; thro' their arched walks Dim at noon-day, discovering many a glimpse Of knights and dames, such as in old romance, And lovers, such as in heroic song, Her pranks the favourite theme of every tongue. But now the day was come, the day, the hour ; Now, frowning, smiling, for the hundredth time, The nurse, that ancient lady, preached decorum ; And, in the lustre of her youth, she gave Her hand, with her heart in it, to Francesco. Great was the joy ; but at the bridal feast, When all sat down, the bride was wanting there. Nor was she to be found ! Her father cried, \" 'Tis but to make a trial of our love !\" And filled his glass to all ; but his hand shook. And soon from guest to guest the panic spread. 'Twas but that instant she had left Francesco, Laughing and looking back and flying still, Her ivory tooth imprinted on his finger. But now, alas ! she was not to be found ; Nor from that hour could anything be guessed, But that she was not ! Perhaps the two, for groves were their delight, That in the spring-time, as alone they sat, Venturing together on a tale of love, Read only part that day. A summer sun Sets ere one half is seen ; but, ere thou go, Enter the house \u2014 prithee, forget it not \u2014 And look awhile upon a picture there. 'Tis of a lady in her earliest youth, The very last of that illustrious race, Done by Zampieri \u2014 but I care not whom. He who observes it \u2014 ere he passes on, Gazes his fill, and comes and comes again, That he may call it up, when far away. She sits, inclining forward as to speak, Her lips half open, and her finger up, As tho' she said \" Beware !\" her vest of gold Broidered with flowers, and clasped from head to foot, An emerald stone in every golden clasp ; Weary of his life, Francesco flew to Venice, and forthwith Flung it away in battle with the Turk. Orsini lived ; and long mightst thou have seen An old man wandering as in quest of something, Something he could not find \u2014 he knew not what. When he was gone, the house remained awhile Silent and tenantless\u2014 then went to strangers. And on her brow, fairer than alabaster, A coronet of pearls. But then her face, So lovely, yet so arch, so full of mirth, The overflowings of an innocent heart \u2014 It haunts me still, tho' many a year has fled, Like some wild melody. Full fifty years were past, and all forgot, When on an idle day, a day of search 'Mid the old lumber in the gallery, That mouldering chest was noticed ; and 'twas said By one as young, as thoughtless as Ginevra, \" Why not remove it from its lurking place ?\" 'Twas done as soon as said ; but on the way Alone it hangs Over a mouldering heirloom, its companion, An oaken chest, half eaten by the worm, But richly carved by Antony of Trent With Scripture stories from the Life of Christ ; A chest that came from Venice, and had held The ducal robes of some old ancestor. It burst, it fell ; and lo ! a skeleton, With here and there a pearl, an emerald-stone, A golden clasp, clasping a shred of gold. All else had perished \u2014 save a nuptial ring, And a small seal, her mother's legacy, Engraven with a name, the name of both, \" Ginevra.\" That by the way \u2014 it may be true or false \u2014 But don't forget the picture ; and thou wilt not, When thou hast heard the tale they told me there. There, then, had she found a grave She was an only child ; from infancy The joy, the pride of an indulgent sire. Her mother dying of the gift she gave, That precious gift, what else remained to him ? Within that chest had she concealed herself, ' Fluttering with joy the happiest of the happy ; When a spring lock, that lay in ambush there, Fastened her down for ever !

See ! she looks up to the golden-edged clouds, And the sailor sings gaily aloft in the shrouds i The Gazette was out at last, And we doubted not the future, For we augured from the past ; But our joy was so like sorrow, Our grief so tinged with pride, Our joy for England's honour, Onward she glides amid ripple and spray, Over the waters \u2014 away and away! Bright as the visions of youth, ere they part, Passing away like a dream of the heart.

We thought, as we hollow'd his narrow bed, And smooth'd down his lonely pillow, That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head Woodman, spare that tree ! And why so ? Because the fondest recollections are associated with that tree. Under its branches I have sported with my companions, who now are gone. They lie in the old churchyard. No stone, with urn on top, or angels' heads around, marks the spot where they sleep in peace ; but this tree bids me remember them. When vaunting foes threatened this isle, the sturdy sons of the village assembled in arms beneath this tree, and vowed to protect their land, the land that gave them birth. They, too, are gone. Time, with his unrelenting hand, swept them away and gathered them to their fathers ; but the tree remains like a monu ment that records the deeds of the mighty after they have passed away And we far away on the billow. Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone, And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him ; But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on, In the grave where a Briton has laid him But half of our heavy task was done, When the clock told the hour for retiring ; And we heard by the distant and random gun, That the foe was sullenly firing. Slowly and sadly we laid him down, From the field of his fame fresh and gory; Woodman, spare this tree ! For under its time-honoured branches the maidens have danced the \" Harvest home,\" and the swains, as they lifted high their sparkling glasses, drank love to them beneath the old oak 'tree. It is here the children of the village play, and boys, when they leave school, cry aloud, \" To the tree ! to the old oak tree!\" We carved not a line, we raised not a stone, But we left him alone in his glory. LITTLE JIM. The cottage was a thatch'd one, The outside old and mean, Woodman, cast thine eye on yonder fabric ! A legend has been handed down by our forefathers. A stone was laid deep in the earth by a follower of the proud and con quering Norman. At the same time, a soldier of the fallen Harold planted an acorn. On the stone was built that church, and from the acorn sprang this stately tree. A venerable hermit saw them, aud said that the tree should outlive the power of the Norman, and when the axe of the woodman should lay it low, the hand of Time would have destroyed the church. Such is the legend : the proud Norman is dead ; and his deeds, his victories, where are they ? Gone ! And the soldier of the fallen Harold shares the same fate as the lowly hermit ; but the tree and the church remain, leading us back to other days, and bidding us remember the deeds of those that are gone. Yet ev'rything within that cot Was wondrous neat and clean. The night was dark and stormy, The wind was howling wild ; A patient mother knelt beside The death-bed of her child. A little worn-out creature \u2014 His once bright eyes grown dim ; It was a collier's only child \u2014 They called him little Jim. And oh ! to see the briny tears Fast hurrying down her cheek, As she offer'd up a prayer in thought- She was afraid to speak, Under this tree sat our forefathers, while before them was the May-pole, and around it danced the maidens. It is here they blessed the \" May Queen,\" and gave her to him she loved best ; then the ale flagon passed merrily round, and the blithe song sounded sweetly in their ears. Lest she might waken one she lov'd Far better than her life, For there was all a mother's love, In that poor collier's wife. Woodman, my locks are thin and gray ; but I remember in tho days of youth, when the fields were green, and the flowers sprang up beneath the feet, when the birds carolled sweetly in the air, and all nature was gay, \u2014 there stood beneath this tree a maiden, fair as the blush of opening day. I saw her, I loved her, and, in that church, 1 married her. Woodman, she is gone! but the tree still remains, calling to the imagination the fondest recollections of other days. Look around you : there are other trees on which to try thy keen axe, but, in memory of the church, of the village, and of her I loved, wood man, spare that tree ! With hands uplifted, see, she kneels Beside the sufferer's bed ; Aud prays that He will spare her boy, And take herself instead !

I am so dry ; Just moisten poor Jim's lips again, And. mother, don't you cry.\" THE BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE. Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note, With gentle trembling haste she held The tea-cup to his lips ; He smiled, to thank her, as he took As his corse to the rampart we hurried : Not a soldier discharged a farewell shot O'er the grave where our hero was buried. We buried him darkly at dead of night, Three little tiny sips. \" Tell father when he comes from work I said good-night to him ; The sods with our bayonets turning, By the straggling moonbeam's misty light, And the lantern dimly burning. No useless coffin confined his breast, And, mother, now I'll go to sleep:\"\u2014 Alas ! poor little Jim. She saw that he was dying \u2014 The child she lov'd so dear, Had utter'd the last words that she Nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him ; But he lay like a warrior taking his rest, With his martial cloak around him.

Horatio's servant once, with bow and cringe, Swinging the parlour door upon its hinge, And walk'd towards the bed. His quiv'ring lips gave token Dreading a negative, and overawed Lest he should trespass, begg'd to go abroad. Of grief he'd fain conceal ; \"Go, fellow ! \u2014 whither ?\" \u2014 turning short aDuut \u2014 \"Nay.

In heaven, once more, to meet again, Their own poor Little Jim. And fetch my cloak ; for, though the night be raw, I'll see him too \u2014 the first I ever saw.\" I knew the man, and knew his nature mild, OTHELLO'S APOLOGY. And was his plaything often when a child ; Most potent, grave, and reverend seigniors, My very noble and approv'd good masters, That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, It is most true ; true, I have married her ; The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent ; no more. Rude am I in speech, And little bless'd with the set phrase of peace ; For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us'd Their dearest action in the tented field ; But somewhat at that moment pinched him close, Else he was seldom bitter or morose. Perhaps his confidence just then betrayed, His grief might prompt him with the speech he made Perhaps 'twas mere good humour gave it birth, The harmless play of pleasantry and mirth. Howe'er it was, his language, in my mind, Bespoke at least a man that knew mankind. But not to moralize too much, and strain To prove an evil, of which all complain (I hate long arguments verbosely spun), And little of this great world can I speak, More than pertains to feats of broils and battles , And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself. Yet, by your patience, I will a round, unvarnish'd tale deliver Of my whole course of love : what drugs, what charms, What conjuration, and what mighty magic One story more, kind friends, and I have done. Once on a time, an emperor, a wise man, No matter where, in China or Japan, Decreed \u2014 that whosoever should offend Against the well-known duties of a friend, Couvicted once, should ever after wear But half a coat, and show his bosom bare. (For such proceeding I am charg'd withal) I won his daughter with. The punishment importing this, no doubt, That all was naught within, and all found out. Her father loved me, oft invited me ; Still questioned me the story of my life, From year to year ; the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have past. 0 happy Britain ! we have not to fear Such hard and arbitrary measure here ; Else, could a law, like that which I relate, Once have the sanction of our triple state, I ran it through, ev'n from my boyish days, To the very moment that he bade me tell it. Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances, Of moving accidents by flood and field : Of hairbreadth 'scapes in th' imminent deadly breach ; Of being taken by the insolent foe, And sold to slavery ; of my redemption thence, Some few, that I have known in days of old, Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold ; While you, my friends, whatever wind should blow4, Might traverse England safely to and fro, All honest men close buttoned to the chin, Broadcloth without, and wanner hearts within. And with it all my travel's history : Wherein of antres vast, and deserts wild, HYMN TO LOVE. Glory to thee, whose vivifying power Pervades all nature's universal frame ! Glory to thee, creator Love ! to thee, Parent of all the smiling charities, Rough quarries, rocks, and hills, whose heads touch heav'r, It was my bent to speak. \u2014 All these to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline. But still the house affairs would draw her hence, That strew the thorny path of life with flowers ! Glory to thee, preserver ! To thy praise The awakened woodlands echo all the day Their living melody ; and warbling forth To thee her twilight song, the nightingale Holds the lone traveller from his way, or charms The listening poet's ear. Where love shall deign To fix his seat, there blameless pleasure sheds Her roseate dews ; content will sojourn there, And happiness behold affection's eye Which ever as she could with haste despatch, She'd come again, and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse ; which I observing, Took once a pliant hour, and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart, That I would all my pilgrimage dilate ; Whereof by parcels she had something heard, But not distinctively. I did consent, And often did beguile her of her tears, When I did speak of some distressful stroke, That my youth suffer'd. My story being done, She gave me for my pains a world of sighs ; She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange : 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful \u25a0' She wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd That heav'n had made her such a man ; \u2014 she thank'd me. And bade me, if I had a friend that lov'd her, I should but teach him how to tell my story, And that would woo her. On this hint I spake She lov'd me for the dangers I had pass'd, And I lov'd her, that she did pity them. This only is the witchcraft I have us'd. Gleam with the mother's smile. Thrice happy he Who feels thy holy power ! he shall not drag, Forlorn and friendless, along life's long path To age's drear abode ; he shall not waste The bitter evening of his days unsooth'd ; But hope shall cheer his hours of solitude, And vice shall vainly strive to wound his breast, Who bears that talisman ; and when he meetb The eloquent eye of tenderness, and hears The bosom-thrilling music of her voice, The joy he feels shall purify his soul, And imp it for anticipated heaven."], [24, "6 THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL. A friend of mine was married to a scold ; To me he came, and all his troubles told. Said he, \" She's like a woman raving mad.\" Alas ! my friend, said I, that's very bad ! \" No, not so bad,\" said he ; \" for, with her true, I had both house and land, and money too.\" As for my feet, the little feet You used to call so pretty, There's one, I know, in Bedford Row, The other's in the city. I can't tell where my head is gone, But Dr. Carpue can ; As for my trunk, it's all pack'd up To go by Pickford's van. That was well, said I ; \"No, not so well,\" said he ; \" For I and her own brother Went to law with one another ; I was cast, the suit was lost, I wish you'd go to Mr. P. And save me such a ride ; I don't half like the outside place They've took for my inside.

But I'll be yours in death, although Sir Astley has my heart. Don't go to weep upon my grave, And think that there I be ; \" No, not so well,\" said he ; \" For, when the sheep I got, They everyone died of the rot.\" That was bad, said I ; They haven't left an atom there Of my auatomie. \" No, not so bad,\" said he ; THE QUAKER'S MEETING. \" For I had thought to scrape the fat And keep it in an oaken vat ; A traveller wended the wilds among, With a purse of gold and a silver tongue ; Then into tallow melt for winter store.\" Well, then, said I, that's better than before ? His hat it was broad, and all drab were his clothes, For ho hated high colours \u2014 except ou his nose, And he met with a lady, the story goes. \" 'Twas not so well,\" said he ; \"For, having got a clumsy fellow To scrape the fat and melt the tallow, The damsel she cast him a merry blink, And the traveller was nothing loath, I think. Her merry black eye gleamed her bonnet beneath, And the Quaker he grinn'd, for he'd very good teeth, And he asked, \" Art thee going to ride o'er the heath ?\" Into the melting fat the fire catches, And, like brimstone matches, Burnt my house to ashes.\" That was bad ! said I ; \" No ! not so bad,\" said he ; \"for, what is best, My scolding wife has gone among the rest.\" \" I hope you'll protect me, kind sir,\" said the maid, \" As to ride this heath over I'm sadly afraid ; For robbers, they say,* here in numbers abound, And I wouldn't for anything I should be found, For, between you and me, I have five hundred pound.\" MARY'S GHOST. 'Twas in the middle of the night, To sleep young William tried, When Mary's ghost came stealing in, And stood at his bedside. \" If that is thine own, dear,\" the Quaker he said, 14 1 ne'er saw a maiden I sooner would wed ; And I have another five hundred just now, In the padding that's under my saddle-bow, And I'll settle it all upon thee, I vow.\" 0 William dear ! 0 William dear ! My rest eternal ceases ; Alas ! my everlasting peace Is broken into pieces ! The maiden she smiled, and her rein she drew, \" Your offer I'll take, but I'll not take you.\" A pistol she held at the Quaker's head \u2014 \" Now give me your gold, or I'll give you my lead, 'Tis under the saddle, I think you said.\" I thought the last of all my cares Would end with my last minute ; But, though I went to my long home, I didn't stay long in it. Tho body-snatchers they have come, And made a snatch at me ; The damsel she ripped up the saddle-bow, And the Quaker was never a quaker till now ! And he saw by the fair one he wished for a bride, His purse borne away with a swaggering stride, And the eye that looked tender, now only defied. It's very hard them kind of men Won't let a body be.

The gold thou hast taken is not mine, my friend, But my master's ; and truly on thee I depend MR. FERDINAND PIGSWIDDY. In the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and \u2014 well The date I've forgotton, but if you've at hand A \"Robson's Directory,\" doubtless 'twill tell\u2014 Mr. Ferdinand Pigswiddy lived in the Strand. Mr. Ferdinand Pigswiddy traded in coals, And also in charcoal, and likewise in coke ; He was fond of \" Don Juan,\" pork-chops and hot rolls, And he thought he could sing, when he only could croak. He was six feet in height, Always thought he was right ; Each night after supper his meerschaum would smoke, Was partial to wearing a Mackintosh cloak; Was his father's sole son, Was in age twenty-one, And by most of his friends he was called \" a rum bloke.\" To make it appear I my trust did defend. \"So fire a few shots thro' my clothes here and there, To make it appear 'twas a desperate affair.\" So Jim he popp'd first through the skirt of his coat, And then thro' his collar, quite close to his throat, \"Now one thro' my broadbrim,\" quoth Ephraim, \"I vote.\" \" I have but a brace,\" said bold Jim, \" and they're spent, And I won't load again for a make-belieVe rent.\" 44 Then!\" said Ephraim, producing his pistol, '4just give My five hundred pounds back, or, as sure as you live, I'll make of your body a riddle or sieve.\" Mr. Ferdinand Pigswiddy went out one night To a party \u2014 or, speaking more strictly \u2014 a ball ; And there he became rather more than polite To a charmiug young lady whose vestments were white, And who seemed to his eyes the most lovely of all The beautiful creatures who thronged on his sight. Jim Barlow was diddled, and tho' he was game, He saw Ephraim's pistol so deadly in aim, That ho gave up the gold, and he took to his scrapers, Aud when the whole story got into the papers, They said that \" the thieves were no match for the Quakers.\" A good deal of whispering, squeezing of fingers, And such like between this young couple took place ; And when Father Time \u2014 who 't is known never lingers, Not even for lovers \u2014 declared, with grave face, That the moment was come when they ought to be moving, Poor Ferdinand felt, WIFE, CHILDREN, AND FRIENDS. When the black-lettered list to the gods was presented \u2014 The list of what fate for each mortal intends \u2014 At the long string of ills a kind goddess relented, And slipped in three blessings \u2014 wife, children, and As his eyes 'gan to melt, At the fast-flitting form of enchantment and grace \u2014 That he'd taken a lesson in what is call'd loving. friends. In vain surly Pluto maintained he was cheated, For justice divine could not compass its ends ; When Ferdinand Pigswiddy got tip next day, He felt an unearthly strange pain at his chest ; His breakfast was banish'd untasted away, Tho' his appetite mostly was one of the best. The scheme of man's penance he swore was defeated, For earth becomes heaven with wife, children, and friends. Some low words he said In dislike of his bread ; And he also did utter Odd things 'bout the butter. If the stock of our bliss is in stranger hands vested, The fund, ill secured, oft in bankruptcy ends ; But the heart issues bills which are never protested When drawn on the firm of wife, children,and friends. His singular pain caused him likewise to sigh ; And ere the sun said to the world it was noon, Though valour still glows in his life's dying embers, The death-wounded tar, who his colours defends, He detected himself, with a tear iu his eye, Composing some very soft lines to the moon. Drops a tear of regret as he dying remembers How bless'd was his home with wife, children, and friends. They were all about \" radiant glory \" and that ; And how the bright stars should be wondered at , How the heavenly bodies were never at fault, The soldier, whose deeds live immortal in story, Whom duty to far distant latitudes sends, And how the blue sky was an azure vault. And somehow or other the moon, and the skies, With transport would barter whole ages of glory For one happy day with wife, children, and friends. And the stars, and all that, led to \"zephyrs \" and \" sighs.' And then followed Cupid, and \" heart-strings,\" and \" ties.' \\ Though spice-breathing gales on his caravan hover, Though for him Arabia's fragrance ascends, And \" glances,\" and \" blushes,\" and \" very bright eyes ;\" Then came some remarks with regard to a walk The merchant still thinks of the woodbines that cover The bower where ho sat with wife, children and friends. By the light of the 'fore-mentioned stars and the moon, And next an intention to fall down and talk To the maid of his soul, on his knees, very soon ; The dayspring of youth, still unclouded by sorrow, Alone on itself for enjoyment depends ; And the moral and end of the story was this \u2014 That if Fate interfered with his prospects of bliss But drear is the twilight of age, if it borrow He should lift up his voice in the midnight air, And, addressing the moon, should most solemnly swei., Or at all events promise and vow and declare, No warmth from the smile of wife, children, and friends. Let the breath of renown ever freshen and nourish The laurel which o'er the dead favourite bends ; O'er me wave the willow, and long may it flourish, Bedew'd with the tears of wife, children, and friends. By the light of its beams, so enchanting and fair, That nothing should keep him from utter despair. Mr. Ferdinand Pigswiddy ate not all day, He fried some cold beef, but his stomach said \u2014 nay ; His tea-time arrived ; not a crumb could he eat, And all that he took was some tea \u2014 very sweet : He really appeared the most wretched of men, And he went up to bed at a quarter-past ten. Let us drink, for my song, growing graver and graver, To subjects too solemn insensibly tends ; Let us drink, pledge me high, love and virtue shall flavour The glass which I fill to wife, children, and friends. Oh ! how Mr. Ferdinand Pigswiddy dreamed, As he tossed on his restless lone bolster that night ! Round his couch eyes and faces in multitudes beamed, And well-rounded figures in garments of light \u2014 HOPE. True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings, Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings."], [26, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 8 Especially one, who was dressed all in white ; And then came a shape which he fancied he knew, A foreign young man in mustaches and rings, Who courted the lady in white in his view, And said in her ear such unspeakable things. Then he waltzed with her ; hang him ! how nicely he did it ; Then he kissed her. Good heavens ! she didn't forbid it! He did it again \u2014 then more sweet things he spoke, Then he led her away\u2014 and then Pigswiddy woke. \" Well, I will,\" was the answer that Pigswiddy got, \" And I'll come back at nine, whether lucky or not.\" And when she came back, \" Have you found her?\" he said. \" I have !\" He fell back in a swoon on his bed, And so long he lay still, you'd have sworn he was dead ; But after a while he recovered, and then \u2014 It was just as St. Clement's was striking ten \u2014 He asked her the very same question again. She sigh'd, then she cried, And at length she replied, For days, and for nights, and for weeks this went on And Ferdinand grew very pallid and wan ; In vain Mr. Bluepill, the doctor, attended him, Nothing he gave or prescribed for him mended him. Thinner and thinner poor Ferdinand grew, In a voice so distraught \u2014 though to curb it she tried \u2014 That the nurse thought that she \u2014 even she \u2014 must have died: \" I've found her, my love, but I've found her a bride ; She was married last week to a Mr. M'CIyde.\" Once more Mr. Pigswiddy bowed down his head, Once more Mr. Pigswiddy fell back in bed, Once more you'd have thought Mr. Pigswiddy dead, And especially so when this sentence he said, Sunken his eyes became, pallid his hue. Mr. Ferdinand Pigswiddy had a mamma, A lady who knew the world's ways pretty well ; She was wise (as most ladies of middle age are), And just forty-nine \u2014 it's no libel to tell. \" Mamma, I shall die ! This lady was sent for (she lived down in Surrey), And she came up to town in a deuce of a hurry ; She was shocked \u2014 well she might be \u2014 at sight of her son, But she saw with a glance what was best to be done. She started the doctor, and said to the youth, 44 Now, Ferdinand Pigswiddy, tell me the truth ; You're in love, are you not? Well, that blush says you are. Now, who is the lady ? Come, tell your mamma !\" My last moments are nigh, But ere I depart, let me bid you good-bye.\" And with this remark on his poor pallid lips, Mr. Pigswiddy suffered a second eclipse ; That last word \"eclipse\" wasn't quite what I meant, But the cravings of rhyme made me change my intent; For \"eclipse\" read \"relapse,\" That will mend it, perhaps, So the truth But I'm one of those devil-may-care sort of chaps, Who write down their rhymes just at hazards and haps ; And I never find out till some sharp critic raps, Which the youth Had so long sought to smother, Was judged of aright, And exposed to the light, And says, that I seem As I'm writing, to dream, By the wisest and best of all doctors\u2014 his mother. 44 Well, really,\" she said, when the murder was out, \" What a story to make all this rumpus about ; I'll very soon cure you \u2014 be guided by me, And to pen down my couplets while taking my naps ; That the words of my song, Are unfitted or wrong But, where have I got ?

Now, although Mr. Pigswiddy vow'd he would die, And kept to that mind for a fortnight, or nigh, On thinking it over again, and perceiving, Before him, nought better than what he was leaving ; And seeing, moreover, that though he had fail'd Where he'd thought that there wasn't a doubt he'd prevails There were many young ladies as pretty and sprightly As Jane \u2014 though of course he'd not speak of her lightly- Quite ready and willing his sorrows to cheer, And his pleasures to share with him, year after year \u2014 He resolv'd he would not to his purpose adhere.

And gadded about, 'Twas th^e seventh \u2014 no,eighth \u2014 no, the ninth of December.'' \" Good heavens !\" said she, \" why it's three months ago, Why she's surely forgot you by this time.\" \" Oh, no!\" Sigh'd the youth, \" I will never \u2014 no, never, believe That so lovely a creature could feign or deceive ; And she told me most solemnly \u2014 yes, she told me, That I never forgotten or slighted should be ; To ball and theatre, concert and rout, \u2014 He quickly got round again, Soon grew quite sound again, And his heart \u2014 tho' he feared he had lost it \u2014 he found again.

Thou, as a gallant bark from Albion's coast (The storms all weather' d, and the ocean cross'd), Shoots into port at some well-haven'd isle, Where spices breathe, and brighter seasons smile, There sits quiescent on the flood, that show Her beauteous form reflected clear below, While airs impregnated with incense play Around her, fanning light her streamers gay ; So thou, with sails how swift ! hast reached the shore, \" Where tempests never beat nor billows roar, \" And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide Of life long since has anchor' d by thy side.

Hover'd thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son, Wretch even then, life's journey just begun ? Perhaps thou gavest me, though unfelt, a kiss : Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss \u2014 Ah ! that maternal smile ! It answers\u2014 Yes. 1 heard the bell toll'd on thy burial day, I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away, And, turning from my nursery window, drew A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu ! But was it such ? \u2014 It was. \u2014 Where thou art gone, Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown, May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore, The parting word shall pass my lips no more !

When men are farthest then Thou art most near ; When friends pass by me, and my weakness shun, Thy chariot I hear.

Entrance at my chamber door : This it is, and nothing more.\" The sun has sunk to his nightly rest, With the cloudlets of beauty around his breast ; Where the crested waters in glory roll'd, And the skies were mantled in crimson and gold ; Bright as the shores of that happy land Where the ranks of the blessed in beauty stand. Presently my soul grew stronger; Hesitating then no longer, \" Sir,\" said I, \" or madam, truly Your forgiveness I implore ; But the fact is, I was napping, And so gently you came rapping, I am called from the cloud-wreathed mountain's brow By the voice of the breeze that is murmuring low ; The eagle on high to his eyrie floats, And the night birds are waking their silvery notes ; And the vesper star, with her chastened beam, Shines calmly and bright in each rolling stream : And so faintly you came tapping, Tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you\" \u2014 Here I opened wide the door ; \u2014 < Darkness there, and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering, Long I stood there, wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals Ever dared to dream before ; She has watched the sun to his nightly home, And she calls me forth, for my reign is come. I gird on my zone with its emeralds bright, And my coronal sparkles with lustrous light ; They have set my throne in the darkened sky, And the watchers are out in their towers on high. But the silence was unbroken, And the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken Was the whispered word, \" Lenore ! \" I come, I come, with my fairy song, O'er the homes of the sleeping to wander along ; While the zephyr her balmiest fragrance flings To the dew-crowned rose from her musky wings ; And the voice of the stars is arising on high, As they roll in their glory along the sky. This I whispered, and an echo Murmured back the word, \" Lenore ! \"\u25a0 Merely this, and nothing more. Back into my chamber turning, All my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping Something louder than before. \" Surely,\" said I, \" surely that is Something at my window lattice ; Let me see, then, what there at is, And silence has come from her secret cell To enchain the world with her mystic spell : The hum of the murmuring bees that roam Awakes not the nymphs in their sylvan home ; And the flowers are shedding a pearly tear For joy that my nightly song they hear. And this mystery explore ; Let my heart be still a moment, And this mystery explore \u2014 'Tis the wind, and nothing more.' Earth sleeps with her bright and sparkling streams, And her children are gone to their pleasant dreams ; Let the music of gladness arise on high From the spirits that sweep o'er the darkened sky : For I come, I come, with my starry train, Through the depths of the heavens to wander again. Open here I flung the shutter, When, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven Of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he, THE RAVEN. Not a minute stopped or stayed he, Once upon a midnight drear;, While I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious Volume of forgotten lore ; While I nodded, nearly napping, Suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, Rapping at my chamber door ; \" 'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \" Tapping at my chamber door \u2014 Only this and nothing more.\" But, with mien of lord or lady, Perched above my chamber door ; Perched upon a bust of Pallas Just above my chamber door \u2014 Perched and sat, and nothing more Then this ebony bird beguiling My sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum Of the countenance it wore ; \" Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, Thou,\" I said, \" art sure no craven, Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven, Wandering from the nightly shore ; Tell me what thy lordly name is On the night's Plutonian shore ? \" Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\" Ah ! distinctly I remember, It was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember Wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow, Vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow \u2014 Sorrow for the lost Lenore \u2014 For the rare and radiant maiden Whom the angels name Lenore \u2014 Nameless here for evermore.

The host proposed bed, but Don John, like a spoon, Declared he'd ride home by the Ught of the moon, And he said that for robbers he cared not a fig, For the smallest of men when \" o'ertaken \" talk big. He'd not ridden a league when a banditti band Stopped the carriage, and ordered his donship to stand. His vizor was clos'd, and gigantic his height, His armour was sable to view ; AU laughter and pleasure were hush'd at his sight, The dogs, as they eyed him, drew back with affright, And the Ughts in the chamber burnt blue. \" I would if I could,\" said Don John, \" but I can't, \" So I'll sit where I am if you'U say what you wan't.\" \" Your money, of course.\" \"Oh! then pray step inside And take it,\" said John.

It is not pleasant to be suddenly bereft of expectations of fortune, and I confess I regret the loss ; but that which I never toiled for, it does not break my heart to resign. I can discern some beauty in a woman though her purse be empty ; nor shaU I forget that she is my wife, because her pecuniary expecta tions are blighted. Wealth may give a briUiancy and poUsh to life, but the want of it neither deprives it of happiness or dignity. Heaven has blessed me with peace of mind and health of person, and, whUe I possess these, I may despise the vicissitudes of fortune. And, gentle men (to Bel. and Falk.), when next you both faU in love with the same lady, take care that she is not secretly engaged beforehand. And you, Marsden, do not again follow a lady for three years ; but, if you reaUy love her, propose on the first opportunity, and marry her on the second.

(OR, THE WONDERFUL \" ONE-HOSS-SHAT.) A LOGICAL STORY. Little of all we value here Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year Without both feeling and looking queer. In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth, So far as I know, but a tree and truth. (This is a moral that runs at large ; Take it. \u2014 You're welcome. \u2014 No extra charge.) Have you ever heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay, That was buflt in such a logical way It ran a hundred years to a day, And then, of a sudden, it ah, but stay, I'll teU you what happen'd without delay, Scaring the parson into fits, Frightening people out of their wits, \u2014 Have you ever heard of that, I say ? First of November, \u2014 the earthquake day \u2014 There are traces of age in the one-hoss-shay, A general flavour of mUd decay, But nothing local, as one may say. There couldn't be \u2014 for the Deacon's art Had made it so like in every part That there wasn't a chance for one to start. For the wheels were just as strong as the thills, And the floor was just as strong as the siUs, And the panels just as strong as the floor, And the whippletree neither less nor more, And the back-crossbar as strong as the fore, And spring and axle and hub encore. And yet, as a whole, it is past a doubt In another hour it will be worn out ! Seventeen hundred and fifty-five, Georgius Secundus was then alive, \u2014 Snuffy old drone from the German hive ! That was the year when Lisbon-town Saw the earth open and gulp her down, And Braddock's army was done so brown, Left without a scalp to its crown. It was on the terrible Earthquake-day That the Deacon finished the one-hoss-shay. Now in building of chaises, I tell you what, There is always somewhere a weakest spot, \u2014 In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill, In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill, In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace, \u2014 lurking still. Find it somewhere you must and wiU, \u2014 Above or below, or within or without, \u2014 And that's the reason beyv>id a doubt, A chaise breaks down, but doesn't wear out. First of November, 'Fifty-five ; This morning the parson takes a drive. Now, small boys, get out of the way : Here comes the wonderful one-hoss-shay, Drawn by a rat-tail'd, ewe-neck'd bay. \" Huddup !\" said the parson. Off went they. The parson was working his Sunday's text, \u2014 Had got to fifthly, and stopp'd perplexed At what the \u2014 Moses \u2014 was coming next. All at once the horse stood still, Close by the meet'n'-house on the hill. \u2014 First a shiver, and then a thrill, Then something decidedly like a spill, \u2014 And the parson was sitting upon a rock, At half-past nine by the meet'n'-house clock,\u2014 Just the hour of the earthquake-shock ! \u2014 What do you think the parson found, When he got up and stared aro.ind ? The poor old chaise in a heap or mound, As if it had been to the mill and ground ! You see, of course, if you're not a dunce, How it went to pieces all at once, \u2014 All at once, and nothing first, \u2014 Just as bubbles do when they burst.*' But the Deacon swore (as Deacons dt), With an \"I dew vum,\" or an, \"I tell yeou,\") He would build one shay to beat the taown 'n' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun' ; It should be so built that it couldn' break daown : \u2014 \"Fur,\" said the Deacon, \"t's mighty plain That the weakes' place mus' stan' the strain ; 'n' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain, Is only jest To make that place uz strong uz the rest.\" So the Deacon inquired of the village folk Where he could find the strongest oak, That couldn't be split, nor bent, nor broke, \u2014 That was for spokes and floor and sills ; He sent for lancewood to make the thills ; The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees , The panels of white-wood, that cuts like chepse, But last like iron for things like these ; The hubs of logs from the \"Settler's ellum,\" Last of its timber, \u2014 they couldn't sell 'em, \u2014 Never an axe had seen their chips, And the wedges flew from between their lips, Their blunt end frizzled like celery-tips ; Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw, Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too, Steel of the finest, bright and blue ; Thoroughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide ; Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide Found in the pit when the tanner died, That was the way he \" put her through.\" \u2014 41 There!\" said the Deacon, \" naow she'll dew !\" End of the wonderful one-hoss shay.

There dwelt in Bethlehem a Jewish maid, And ZiUah was her name, so passing fair That aU Judea spake the virgin's praise. He who had seen her eyes' dark radiance How it revealed her soul, and what a soul Beam'd in the mild effulgence, woe to him ! For not in soUtude, for not in crowds, Might he escape remembrance, nor avoid Her imag'd form w hich foUow'd everywhere, And fiU'd the heart, and fix'd the absent eye. Alas for him ! her bosom own'd no love Save the strong ardour of reUgious zeal, For ZiUah upon heaven had centred all Her spirit's deep affections. So for her Her tribes-men sigh'd in vain, yet reverenc'd The obdurate virtue that destroy'd their hopes. They rose, they spread, they raged ; The breath of God went forth ; the ascending fire Beneath its influence bent, and all its flames, In one long lightning-flash concentrating, Darted and blasted Hamuel, \u2014 him alone ! Hark ! \u2014 what a fearful scream the multitude Pour forth ! \u2014 and yet more miracles ! the stake Branches and buds, and spreading its green leaves, Embowers and canopies the innocent maid Who there stands glorified ; and roses, then First seen on earth since Paradise was lost, Profusely blossom round her, white and red In all their rich variety of hues ; And fragrance such as our first parents breathed In Eden, she inhales, vouchsafed to her A presage sure of Paradise regain'd. One man there was, a vain and wretched man, Who saw, desired, despaired, and hated her ; His sensual eye had gloated on her cheek E'en tiU the flush of angry modesty THAT HEATHEN CHINEE. Gave it new charms, and made him gloat the more. She loathed thec^an, for Hamuel's eye was bold, And the strong workings of brute selfishness Had moulded his broad features ; and she fear'd The bitterness of wounded vanity (in dialect.) Which I wiRh to remark \u2014 And my language is plain \u2014 That for ways that are dark, And tricks that are vain, That with a fiendish hue would overcast His faint and lying smile.

He spread abroad Whispers that travel fast, and iU reports That soon obtain beUef ; how ZiUah's eye, When in the temple heaven-ward it was raised, Did swim with rapturous zeal, but there were those Who had beheld the enthusiast's melting glance With other feelings fiU'd : \u2014 that 'twas a task The heathen Chinee is peculiar ; Which the same I would rise to explain. /i.h Sin wa3 his name ; And I shall not deny In regard to the same, What that name might imply : But his smile it was pensive and child-Uke, As I frequent remarked to BiU Nye. It was August the third, Of easy sort to play the saint by day Before the public eye, but that all eyes Were closed at night ; \u2014 that ZiUah's Use was foul, Yea, forfeit to the law. And quite soft was the skies, Which it might be inferred That Ah Sin was likewise ; Yet he played it that day upon William And me, in a way I despise. Shame \u2014 shame to man, That he should trust so easUy the tongue Which stabs another's fame !

The assembled Bethlemites Beheld the scene, and when they saw the maid Bound to the stake, with what calm holiness Which was stuffed full of aces and bowers, And the same with intent to deceive. Yet the hands that were played By that heathen Chinee, And the points that he made Were quite frightful to see, \u2014 She listed up her patient looks to heaven, They doubted of her guilt. \u2014 With other thoughts Stood Hamuel near the pUe ; him savage joy Let thitherward, but now within his heart Unwonted feelings stirr'd, and the first pangs Of weening guilt, anticipant of hell! TUl at last he put down a \" right bower,\" Which the same Nye had dealt unto me. Then I looked up at Nye, And he gazed upon me, Aad he rose with a sigh, And he said, \" Can this be ?

Soon aster he had been carried [to the cock-pit, his wound was discovered to be mortal; he felt this himself, and insisted that the surgeon should leave him, to attend those whom he might yet save. He was in great pain, and intensely anxious to know how the battle went. ' Will no one bring Hardy to me ? ' he asked : ' he must be killed ! he is surely dead ! ' At length Hardy came, and the two friends shook hands in silence. After a pause, the dying man faintly uttered, ' Well, Hardy, how goes the day P ' ' Very weU ; ten ships have already struck.'

He could not tell in the confusion the exact number of allies that had sur rendered ; but there were at least fifteen ; for the other ships had followed their admirals into action, breaking the enemy's line, and engaging closely to leeward, in the same gallant style as the Victory and Sovereign. Nelson answered, ' That is well ; but I bargained for twenty. ' And his wish was prophetic ; he had not miscalculated the superiority of his foUowers ; twenty actuaUy surren dered. Having ordered the fleet to anchor, he again spoke of himself. ' Don't throw me overboard. Kiss me, Hardy ! ' Hardy knelt down, and obeyed in sUence.

In the same hour the breath of life receiving, They came together and were beautiful ; But, as they slumbered in their mother's lap, How mournful was their beauty ! She would sit, And look and weep, and look and weep again ; For Nature had but half her work achieved, Denying, like a step-dame, to the babes Her noblest gifts ; denying \u00abceech to one, And to the other \u2014 reason. The eagle and the child ; the child unhurt ; Though, such the grasp, not even in death relinquished. But, at length, (Seven years gone by, seven melancholy years) Another came, as fair and fairer stiU ; And now, how anxiously the mother watched Till reason dawned and speech declared itself ! Reason and speech were his ; and down she knelt Clasping her hands in silent ecstasy.

Thou art come to the land of Ught and joy, To the home of each fair and lovely thing, Where the bright flowers blow, and the sweet birds sing Where the founts are clear as the skies above, And the soft wind speaks Uke whisper'd love, Where the violet breathes on the dawn-Ut air Of a spring that never dies, And the asphodel shines as marble fair, In happy ignorance the children played ; Alike unconscious, through their cloudless day, Of what they had and had not ; everywhere Gathering rock-flowers ; or, with their utmost might, Loosening the fragment from the precipice, And, as it tumbled, Ustening for the plunge ; Yet, as by instinct, at the 'customed hour Returning ; the two eldest, step by step, Lifting along, and with the tenderest care, Their infant-brother. And the stars Uke woman's eyes, Where the sunrise is bright as the sunset is calm, And the silent midnight, from her couch of balm, Heareth nought but the far stream's ceaseless hum ; To this home of deUght have thy footsteps come.

That speaks through thy parted Ups, That Uves in and looks from thy graceful form ; With a scream, And the spirit of calm that sleeps Such as an eagle sends forth, when he soars, A scream that through the woods scattered dismay, The idiot-boy looked up into the sky, On the pearly white of thy wreathed brow,\u2014 Too lovely are these and too beautiful thou, To brave the chill gale, and the salt sea foam ; No, no ; thou art made for this island home.

And have waited thee long in this home of joy I have leaned on the bare rock day by day, From the purple-plumed dawn untU gloomy gray ; And have wept when the far-seen sad grew dim, Fading away from the water's rim. Ah me ! I could tell of the sleepless night, Of the still deserted bower, And the seaward gaze in the pale moonlight, From yon lone and Ughted tower : But enough ; thou art come, and my task shaU he To gather the honey-bee's gold for thee, With sweets from the mountain, and sweets from the weU, Fled lo her mantle as for refuge there, And, as at once o'ercome with fear and grief, Covered his head and wept.

CONTRADICTION I was once at a country theatre when the amusements were to commence with the beautiful play of the Lady of Lyons. The young gentleman who had the ambition to play the principal character had appUed to the manager to know when it would be proper for him to move his hands before, when behind, and when sideways. He could, he said, repeat the words very weU, but was at a loss to know how to foUow Shakspeare's advice to players in suiting the action to the word. The instructions were accordingly inserted in the part, and the young gentleman got them so thoroughly impressed upon his memory that, when in the cottage scene, where young Melnottc con fesses his love for Pauline, he began thus : \u2014 In Anster, long since, in the shire o'Fife, There Uved a man who wanted a wife ; A fisher he was, most stout and bold, With a temper much more hot than cold ; And he often said that whoe'er married him Should be somewhat like his wherry trim, Obedient in aU things to the lawful force With which he, as steersman, should guide her co>i:cn, And that with her tongue she should not afflict him. Nor yet for her life once contradict him, But, whatever he might do or say, She should look on't as law, and let it have way. In time, as things wiU come to pass, Pauline (before) by pride behind) This fisher heard of a Dysart lass, Who was most modest, mUd, and meek, With lips that looked as they scarce could speak : In short, the very thing he wanted ; So love was soon asked, and soon was granted. Angels have fallen ere thy time (sideways) : by pride That sole aUoy of thy most lovely mould (all round) \u2014 The evil spirit of a bitter love, And a revengeful heart, had power upon thee (sideways) . From my first years my soul was fiU'd with thee (behind) : I saw thee (before) midst the flow'rs the lowly boy Tended, unmarked by thee \u2014 a spirit of bloom, The pair were wedded, and he with pride Brought home in his boat his gentle bride ; But, as they were cruising along the shore, He saw what he had not seen before ; For she, when asked by the joUy bridegroom To sit aside a Uttle for room, Aud joy, and freshness, as if Spring itself Were made a Uving thing (before), and wore thy shape (behind) ! I saw thee (before), and the passionate heart of man Entei 'd the breast of the wild-dreaming boy (behind). And from that hour I grew (sideways) \u2014 what to the last I shaU be\u2014 thine adorer (behind) ! Well, this love Vain, frantic, (behind) guilty, if thou wilt, became A fouutain (sideways) of ambition and bright hope ; I thought of tales (behind) that by the winter hearth , Old gossips teU \u2014 how maidens sprung from kings (side- ways) 'Have stooped from their high sphere ; how love, like death, Levels all ranks, and lays the shepherd's crook Had scarcely moved from her place one inii_a_9f When back again he saw her in it ; And this in so quiet and mUd a way, As if she both would, and would not, obey. The act was a trifle \u2014 might mean no harm, But yet it gave him a Uttle alarm. And full soon its meaning came plain to view, And fuU soon our fisher began to rue ; For ere the first month was past and gone. The lady's voice had changed its tone, Beside the sceptre (behind). And to everything he did or said An opposition flat she made ; My father died (sideways) ; and I, the peasant-born Was my own lord (behind). Thy bright image Glass'd in my soul (sideways), I saw thee (before) and took all the hues of glory, Aud lured me on to those inspiring toils (behind) . Pauline, for thee I sought to borrow from each grace (before), And paid them aU back (sideways). I thought of thee (before), And passion taught me poesy \u2014 of thee (behind), TiU finding himself so greatly thwarted, He swore he was almost broken-hearted. A wrangling year had passed away, When, going one morn at break of day, To launch to the fishing, he found that his boat, Which only last night he had left afloat, Was cut and run, out of sight at sea, Leaving only a stump of the rope on the quay. Some ill-wilUng neighbour had done the deed\u2014 \u00bb At least this was part of our fisher's creed. So he hastened home to teU his wife, And on the painter's canvas grew the life Of beauty (sideways) ! Art became the shadow (behind). Men call'd me vain (before) \u2014 some mad (behind) \u2014 I heeded How some rogue had cut loose his boat with a knife ; The stump of the rope at the same time he rears\u2014 \" My dear, \" said she, \" you must mean with shear? ; \" The cut is of that kind clear and plain. \" \" A knife say I, \" quoth the husband again. not; I still toil'd on \u2014 hoped on \u2014 for it was sweet, If not to win, to feel more worthy thee (sidewa/ys). At last, in one mad hour, I dared to pour The thoughts (behind) that burst their channels into song (sideways), And sent them to thee (before) \u2014 such a tribute, lady (behind), As beauty rarely scorns (before), even from the meanest And to it they went on this nice little matter, Till he swore she would kiU him outright with her clatter And, enraged at last beyond aU enduring, He would try her, he said, with a new mode of curing j So straight to the pier he dragged her down, And, holding her o'er by the skirts of her gown, He dipped her into the brimming flood, And kept her there for a minute good ; Then, drawing her up, he asked her how (sideways). The name appended by the burning heart That long'd to show its idol what bright things It had created (behind). When thy disdain Made my whole soul a chaos \u2014 in that hour The tempters found me a revengeful tool For their revenge ! Thou hadst trampled on the worm (before)\u2014 \u2022t torned and stung thee ! (behind). She thought the rope had been severed now ? Quoth she, all gasping, \" By shears, by shears ! \" \u2014 Down again she went over head and ears. And this time he vowed she should have a good sup Of the bitter brine ere he drew her up ; So he kept her in for two minutes at least, So that, when she came up all speech had ceased. Still, still, however, speaking or dumb, She would not to her man succumb : A GRACEFUL APOLOGY.

That sign was the snap of the scissors of Fate, For down again she was plunged by her mate, And left to float away on the Firth, And never was seen again on earth.

And CounseUor Brougham was aU in a fume At the thought of the march to Moscow : The Russians, he said, they were undone, And then came on the frost and snow, All on the road from Moscow. And the great Fee-faw-fum Would presently come With a hop, step, and jump into London. For as for his conquering Russia, The wind and the weather he found in that hour, Cared nothing for him nor for all his power ; For him who, while Europe crouch'd under his rod, Put his trust in his fortune, and not in his God. Worse and worse everyday the elements grew, The fields were so white, and the sky so blue, Sacrebleu ! Ventrebleu ! However some persons might scoff it, Do it he could, and do it he would, And from doing it nothing would come but good, And nothing could call him off it.

And he did calm himself, and fix his brow THE DREAM. Our life is twofold ; Sleep hath its own world, A boundary between the thing3 misnamed Death and existence : Sleep hath its own world, A boundless realm of wUd reaUty ; And dreams in their development have breath, And tears, and tortures, and the touch of joy ; They leave a weight upon our waking thoughts, They take a weight from off our waking toUs, They mak\"4. us what we were not \u2014 what they will And shake us with the vision that's gone by, The dread of vanish' d shadows \u2014 Are they so ? Is not the past aU shadow ? What are they ? Creations of the mind ? The mind can make Substance, and people planets of its own With beings brighter than have been, and give A breath to forms which can outhve aU flesh. I would recaU a vision which I dream'd Perchance in sleep \u2014 for in itself a thought, A slumbering thought is capable of years, And curdles a long Use into one hour. Into a kind of quiet ; as he paused, The lady of his love re-entered there, She was serene and smiling then, and yet She knew she was by him beloved ; she knew, For quickly comes such knowledge, that his heart Was darken'd with her shadow, and she saw That he was wretched, but she saw not all. He rose, and with a cold and gentle grasp He took her hand ; a moment o'er his face A tablet of unutterable thoughts Was traced, and then it faded, as it came ; He dropped the hand he held, and with slow steps Retired, but not as bidding her adieu, For they did part with mutual smUes ; he pass'd From out the massy gate of that old hall, And mounting on his steed he went his way ; And ne'er repassed that hoary threshold more. I saw two beings in the hues of youth Standing upon a hiU, a gentle hiU, Green and of mUd declivity, the last As 'twere the cape of a long ridge of such, Save that there was no sea to lave its base, But a most Uving landscape, and the wave Of woods and cornfields, and the abodes of men Scattered at intervals, and wreathing smoke Arising from such rustic roofs ; \u2014 the hill Was crown'd with a pecuUar diadem Of trees, in circular array, so fix'd, Not by the sport of nature, but of man : These two, a maiden and a youth, were there Gazing\u2014 the one on aU that was beneath, Fair as herself \u2014 but the boy gazed on her ; They both were young, and one was beautiful ; They both were young \u2014 yet not alike in youth. As the sweet moon on the horizon's verge The maid was on the eve of womanhood ; The boy had fewer summers, but his heart Had far outgrown his years, and to his eye There was but one beloved face on earth, And that was shining on him ; he had look'd Upon it tiU it could not pass away ; He had no breath, no being, but in hers ; She was his voice ; he did not speak to her, But trembled on her words ; she was his sight, For his eye followed hers, and saw with hers Which coloured aU his objects : \u2014 he had ceased To Uve within himself; she was his life, The ocean to the river of his thoughts, Which terminated aU : upon a tone, A touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow, And his cheek change tempestuously \u2014 his heart Unknowing of its cause of agony. But she in these fond feelings had no share : Her sighs were not for him ; to her he was Even as a brother \u2014 but no more ; 'twas much, For brotherless she was, save in the name Her infant friendship had bestowed on him ; Herself the soUtary scion left Of a time-honoured race. It was a name Which pleased him, and yet pleased him not \u2014 and why ? Time taught him a deep answer \u2014 when she loved Another ; even now she loved another, And on the summit of that hiU she stood A change came o'er the spirit of my dream. The boy was sprung to manhood : in the wUds Of fiery cUmes he made himself a home, And his soul drank their sunbeams ; he was girt With strange and dusky aspects ; he was not Himself Uke what he had been ; on the sea Aud on the shore he was a wanderer ; There was a mass of many images Crowded Uke waves upon him, but he was A part of all ; and in the last he lay Reposing from the noon-tide sultriness, Couched among faUen columns, in the shade Of ruin'd walls that had survived the name,4/ Of those who rear'd them ; by bis sleeping side Stood camels grazing, and some goodly steeds Were fasten'd near a fountain ; and a man Clad in a flowing garb did watch the whUe, WhUe many of his tribe slumber' d around \u2022 And they were canopied by the blue sky, So cloudless, clear, and purely beautiful, That God alone was to be seen in 'ufaven. A change came o'er the spirit Of my \u2022 ' -am. The lady of his love was wed wvth ont. Who did not love her better ; in her home A thousand leagues from his, her native home, She dwelt, begirt with growing infancy, Daughters and sons of beauty ; but behold ! Upon her face there was the tint of grief, The settled shadow of an inward strife, And an unquiet drooping of the eye As if its Ud were charged with unshed tears. 'What could her grief be ?

She had loved him net. Nor given him cause to deem himself beloved, Nor could he be a part of that which prey'd Upon her mind, a spectre of the past. A change came o'er the spirit of my dream. The wanderer was return'd; I saw him stand Before an altar, with a gentle bride ; Her face was fair, but was not that which made The starlight of his boyhood ; as he stood Even at the altar, o'er his brow there came Looking afar if yet her lover's steed Kept pace with her expectancy, and flew.

And this the world calls frenzy ; but the wise Have a far deeper madness, and the glance Of melancholy is a fearful gift ; The slaves flew o'er the hiU.

No hoarse command, no need of hand, Nor voice in aU their way, To bid them close these dust-clad files, To keep their just array ; The hope that bears their captain on, The rage that scorneth rest, Throbs in the soldier's honest heart, Bums in the drummer's breast \u2014 Lightens the load of lance and gun, The weight of \"ringing steel, Whose biting ball and sharp swift fall The assassin soon shall feel. Now sinketh in the tall cane-brake, What is it but the telescope of truth, Which strips the distance of its phantasies, And brings life near in utter nakedness, Making the cold reality too real ? My dream was past ; it had no further change. It was of a strange order, that the doom Of these two creatures should be thus traced out Almost like a reaUty, the one The long thin line of spears ; Now on the crest the vengeful gleam Of bayonets appears ; Now from his lair in rook and cave, Tho opposing foe they thrust To end in madness, both in misery.

How happy was I in it then ! I loved Its very storms ! Yes, Emma, I have sat In my boat at night, when, midway o'er the lake, The stars went out, and down the mountain gorge The wind came roaring \u2014 I have sat and eyed The thunder breaking from his cloud, and smUed To see him shake his lightnings o'er my head, And think I had no master save his own !

I stood beside the grave of him who blazed The comet of a season, and I saw The humblest of aU sepulchres, and gazed With not the less of sorrow and of awe On that neglected turf and quiet stone, With name no clearer than the names unknown, Which lay unread around it; and I ask'd The gardener of that ground, why it might be That for this plant strangers his memory task'd Through the thick deaths of half a century ; And thus he answered\u2014\" WeU, I do not know Why frequent trave'ders turn to pUgrims so; He died before my day of sextonship, For two a-breast to pass ?

And the lightnings of God, O'er the firmament trod, His might in their marchings, His eye in their flash ! The howling winds moan'd as they swept through the sky, Like wandering spirits in agony ; And the thunder-peals seem'd as they awfully broke, To echo the voice of the storm as it spoke.

Why ask I that ? my mangled body shows, My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows, That I must yield my body to the earth, And, by my faU, the conquest to my foe. Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, Under whose shade the ramping Uon slept ; Whose top branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree, And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind. These eyes, that now are dimmed with death's black veil, Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun, To search the secret treasons of the world ; The wrinkles in my brows, now fiU'd with blood, Were Ukened oft to kingly sepulchres ; For who Uved king but I could dig his grave ? And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow ? Lo ! now my glory smeared in dust and blood ! My parks, my walks, my manors that I had, Even now forsake me ; arid of all my lands Hard is his lot, that here by fortune plac'd, Must watch the wild vicissitudes of taste : With every meteor of caprice must play, And chase the new-blown bubbles of the day. Ah ! let not censure term our fate our choice, The stage but echoes back the pubUc voice, The drama's laws the drama's patrons give, For we that Uve to please, must please to Uve. Then prompt no more the follies you decry, As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die ; 'Tis yours this night to bid the reign commence, Of rescued nature and reviving sense ; To chase the charms of sound, the pomp of sho\\r, For useful mirth and salutary woe ; Bid scenic virtue form the rising age, And Truth diffuse her radiance from the stage. Is nothing left me, but my body's length ! Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust ? And, live we how we can, yet die we must. THE SPIRIT OF TIME. Thus spoke Chidher, the ever young, I pass'd a proud city near, A man pluck'd fruit, the green trees among, I ask'd, how long is the city here ? Plucking the fruit he answer'd me, PROGRESS OF THE DRAMA. When Learning's triumph o'er her barbarous foes First rear'd the stage, immortal Shakspeare rose. Each change of many-colour'd Use he drew, Exhausted worlds, and then imagined new. Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign, And panting time toU'd after him in vain : His powerful strokes presiding Truth impress'd, And unresisted passion storm'd the breast. This proud city that here you see, Has been ever here, and wiU ever be ! And five hundred years from that day Came I the very same way ! Not a trace of that city could there be found 5 But a shepherd played on his reed alone : His flocks fed free on the mossy ground ; I ask'd, how long is the city gone ? Then Jonson came, instructed from the school, To please in method, and invent by rule ; His studious patience and laborious art, By regular approach essay'd the heart ; Cold approbation gave the Ung'ring bays ; For those who durst not censure, scarce could praise, A mortal born, he met the general doom, Playing his reed he answer'd me, This pasture ground that here you see Has been ever here, and wiU ever be ! And five hundred years from that day Came I the very same way ! But left, Uke Egypt's kings, a lasting tomb. There found I a sea \u2014 through the biUow's roar Came a fisherman, rowing near ; The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame, Nor wish'd for Jonson's art, nor Shakspeare's flame ; Themselves they studied ; as they felt, they writ ; Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit. As he rested a moment upon his oar I ask'd, how long is this wUd sea here ? With a laugh and a shrug he answered me \u2014 Since the bUlows have fbam'd in their angry gl&3 Have been fishermen here and wUl ever be ! Vice always found a sympathetic friend ; They pleased their age, and did not aim to mend. Yet bards like these aspired to lasting praise, And proudly hop'd to pimp in future days : Their cause was general, their Supports were strong, Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long ; TiU shame regain'd the post that sense betray' d, And virtue caU'd oblivion to her aid. And five hundred years from that day Came I the very same way ! There found I a forest with brier-grown tracks, Where bounded the startled deer ; One feU'd the taU trees with his broad, bright ait4, I ask'd, how old is the green wood here ? This wood has been always here, said he, And the trees have been ever a home to me, And as they have been so they ever wiU be ! And five hundred years from that day Came I the very same way ! Then, crush'd by rules, and weaken'd as refin'd, For years the power of tragedy declin'd ; From bard to bard the frigid caution crept, TUl declamation roar'd, whilst passion slept; Yet stUl did passion deign the stage to tread, Philosophy remain' d, though nature fled. But forced, at length, her ancient reign to quit, She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of wit. Exulting foUy haU'd the joyous day, And pantomime and song confirmed her sway. There found I a city of pomp and guilt, Where the people with loud voice speed, I ask'd, since when is this city bmlt ? And where is the wood, and sea, and reed ? With the din they scarcely hearken to me : It has ever been such as now you see, And as it has been, so it ever will be ! But who the coming changes can presage, And mark the future periods of the stage.

The gray of the desert's dawn Had tinged the mighty mound That stands as the tomb of Babylon, On her ancient river's bound ; For the land hath kept no trace beside, Of the old Chaldeans' power and prido. A CHILD OF SONG. A child of song ? \u2014 oh ! sadly pleasing name, Which steals like music to my gladden' d heart, And, utter'd by the myriad lips of fame, Becomes a speU, whose power wiU ne'er depart. Upon that lonely height, To mark the morning climb, The skies of his native soUtude, The Genius of the Desert stood, And saw the conqueror, Time, Oh ! child of song ! the voice of memory brings Strange recoUections of thy Use and lyre : The pride that burns, the poverty that stings, Approach on pinions swist and dim, But ever welcome was he to him. The brief hopes \u2014 born to dazzle and expire. For his journey left no track On tho long-untrodden sand, No human hopes or homes were there, No blooming face or flowing hair, To fear his withering hand ; And the Genius greeted him who made So wide the bounds of his sceptre's shade. I think of him, the mighty one of old- Time-honoured Homer, aged, poor, and blind ; Who suffer'd much, as history hath told, Yet filled the world with his immortal mind. I think of Ovid by the lonely main, Mourning his exUe from Imperial Rome ; They spoke of their ancient sway ; Of the temples rich and vast, That mouldered in their sight away ; And the scorn of ages passed O'er the desert dweller's lip and brow, As he said, \"What gods do they worship now t \u25a0' Of Tasso, writhing in his dungeon chain, Removed from love, from Uberty, and home. I think of Milton, Christian bard and sage, Who sang man's primal purity and sin, Who strove for freedom in a stormy age, Bereft of Ught, save that which burn'd within. The father of the years Looked up to the rising sun, And said, \" In the bounds bis path surrounds Musing on Chatterton, my eyes grow dim With heartfelt tears, which wiU not be denied : There reigns no god but one. All faith beside hath grown faint and cold, The only god in the world is Gold. WeU may a kindred spirit grieve for him \u2014 \" The sleepless boy who perish'd in his pride.\" Nor less for Burns, that splendour of the North, That bright, brief meteor in the heaven of song ; Though frail, his heart deep sympathized with worth, Though poor, his soul could brook \" th' oppressors wrong.\" \" 'Tis Gold in the city proud, 'Tis Gold in the hamlet low, To it they kneel with the bridal ved, And the mourner's garb of woe; And chUdhood's joy, and youth's bright hair, And the peace of age are offered there. And where Ues gentle Keats, to whom was given The rarest gift that moves the minds of men ? Beneath the blue of an Italian heaven, \" I stood on Nimrod's tower, When it rose to meet the stars, Slain by the poison of the critic's pen. And the boundless pride and the empire wide Of the world's first conquerors, Brought tribute to the gods of old, But they ne'er were served Uke that mighty Gold. These, and a thousand more, have wrestled hard Beneath misfortune's unrelenting ban ; The selfish world withheld the due reward, Worshipped the poet, but o'erlooked the man. \" They praise the Christians' God, And they buUd him temples fair, The prayer is made, and the creed is said, But Gold is honoured there. Such is the minstrel's lot : \u2014 yet do not deem That aU things unto him are sad and cold ; For he hath joy amid the realms of Dream, And mental treasures which cannot be told. For they bear from the holy place no sign That tells of a worship more divine. His is the universe \u2014 around, above, Beauty is ever present to his eye ; He breathes the element of hope and love, And shrines his thoughts in words which ne'er wiU die. \" StiU are temples raised To the God of Ught and song, For many scorn, and some are borne By the tides of life along, Who oft in their weariness look back When ills oppress, he grasps the soothing lyre, And throws his firming hand athwart the strings, Feels in his soul the pure ethereal fire, And linka his language with eternal things. To the Ught they left in that chosen track. \" In groves and crowded marts I have sought Love's shrines in vain, Yet it may be that in sUent hearts Their ruins stiU remain ; Beneath the grandeur of the palace dome The Uving music of his song is heard ; Beneath the roof-tree of the humblest home, But scorched by fire, and stained with tears, And buried deep in the dust of years.\"' The strongest soul, the coldest heart is st:4+'d. Then who would change the poet's strange ca*, er For aU that power can grant, that wealth can give ? Man's common lot may be his portion here, But when he dies, he does not cease to live. \" And has the world grown old In vain P \" said the shadowy sage, \" And come at length to the age of gold, But not the golden age ?"], [56, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 38 Who captive led captivity, Who robb'd the grave of victory,\u2014 And took the sting from death ! THE LAST MAN. All worldly shapes shall melt in gloom, The sun himself must die, Go, sun, whUe mercy holds me up Before this mortal shaU assume Its immortality ! On nature's awful waste, To drink this last and bitter cup I saw a vision in my sleep, Of grief that man shall taste \u2014 Go, tell the night that hides thy face, Thou saw'st the last of Adam's race, That gave my spirit strength to sweep Adown the gulf of Time !

As Adam saw her prime ! The sun's eye had a sickly glare, The earth with age was wan, The skeletons of nations were Around that lonely man ! Some had expired in fight, \u2014 the brands Still rusted in their bony hands ; THE NATURE OF TRUE ELOQUENCE. When pubhc bodies are to be addressed on momentous | occasions, when great interests are at stake, and strong passions excited, nothing is valuable in speech farther than it is connected with high inteUectual and moral endowments. Clearness, force, and earnestness, are the qualities which produce conviction. True elo quence, indeed, does not consist in speech. It cannot be brought from far. Labour and learning may tod for it, but they wiU toil in vain. Words and phrases may be marshalled in every way, but they cannot compass it. It must exist in the man, in the subject, and in the occasion. Affected passion, intense expression, the pomp of declama tion, all may aspire after it ; they cannot reach it. It comes, if it comes at aU, like the out-breaking of a foun tain from the earth, or the breaking forth of volcanic fires, with spontaneous, original, native force. The graces taught in the schools, the costly ornaments and studied contrivances of speech, shock and disgust men, when their own Uves, and the fate of their wives, their chUdren, and their country, hang on the decision of the hour. Then, words have lost their power, rhetoric is vain, and aU elabo rate oratory contemptible. Even genius itself then feels rebuked and subdued, as in the presence of higher quaUties. Then, patriotism is eloquent ; then, self-devo tion is eloquent. The clear conception, out-running tho deductions of logic, the high purpose, the firm resolve, the dauntless spirit, speaking on the tongue, beaming from the eye, informing every feature, and urging the whole man onward, right onward to his object \u2014 this is eloquence ; or rather, it is something greater and higher than aU elo\u00bb quence, \u2014 it is action, noble, sublime, godlike action. In plague and famine some ! Earth's cities had no sound nor tread ; And ships were drifting with the dead To shores where aU was dumb ! Yet, prophet-like, that lone one stood, With dauntless words and high, That shook the sere leaves from the wood As if a storm pass'd by \u2014 Saying, We are twins in death, proud sun, Thy face is cold, thy race is run, 'Tis mercy bids thee go ; For thou ten thousand thousand years Hast seen the tide of human tears, That shall no longer flow. What though beneath thee man put forth His pomp, his pride, his skiU; And arts that made fire, flood, and earth, The vassals of his wiU ; \u2014 Yet mourn I not thy parted sway, Thou dim discrowned king of day : For all those trophied arts And triumphs that beneath thee sprang, Heal'd not a passion or a pang Entail'd on human hearts. Go, let obUvion's curtain fall Upon the stage of men, Nor with thy rising beams recall Life's tragedy again. Its piteous pageants bring not back, Nor waken flesh upon the rack Of pain anew to writhe ; Stretch'd in disease's shapes abhorr'd, Or mown in battle by the sword, Like grass beneath the scythe. DEADMAN'S ISLAND. See you, beneath yon cloud so dark, Fast gUding along a gloomy bark ? Her sails are full, \u2014 though the wind is stUl, And there blows not a breath her sails to fiU ! Say, what doth that vessel of darkness bear P The silent calm of tho grave is there, Save now and again a death-knell rung, And the flap of the saUs with night-fog hung There Ueth a wreck on the dismal shore Of cold and pitiless Labrador ; Even I am weary in yon skies To watch thy fading fire ; Test of aU sunless agonies, Behold not me expire.

And from his Ups escaped a groan, Excelsior ! \" Try not the pass ! \" the old man said ; \" Dark lowers the tempest overhead, The roaring torrent is deep and wide,\" And loud that clarion voice replied, Excelsior! \"Enough, enough,\" he smUing said, And lowly bent his haughty head, \" That all may have their due, Now each in turn must play his part, And pledge the ladye of his heart, Like gaUant knight and true ! \" \" Oh ! stay,\" the maiden said, \" and rest Thy weary head upon this breast ! \" A tear stood in his bright blue eye, But stiU he answered, with a sigh, Excelsior ! Then, one by one, each guest sprang up, And drained in turn the brimming cup, And nam'd the lov'd one's name ; And each, as hand on high he raised, His ladye's grace or beauty praised, Her constancy and fame. \" Beware the pine-tree's withered branch ! Beware the awful avalanche ! \" This was this peasant's last good-night, A voice replied, far up the height, Excelsior !

In London streets we often find a mob Got up to hoax, at other times to rob ; Whate'er is meant, 'tis prudent to- escape, For lookers-on may get into a scrape j But curiosity wUl sometimes sway, And thrust the guardian prudence from the way. And so it was with me the other day. Each guest upstarted at the word, And laid a hand upon his sword, With fury flashing eye, And Stanley said, \" We crave the name, Proud knight, of this most peerless dame, Whose love you count so high.\" I saw a crowd coUected ; up I went, Poked here and there, to find out what was meant j I saw a woman looking with dismay, St. Leon paused, as if he would Not breathe her name in careless mood I saw a donkey banqueting on hay ; But what of that ? there was no explanation, Until a female made this declaration : \u2014 \" As this young woman walk'd along with me, And yonder donkey foUow'd up, you see ; I thought he only meant to smell her dress \u2014 I never dreamt he had such vieiousness j But aU at once he seizes her behind \u2014 I don't say where or what\u2014 but never mind, Something did burst, and out came all this hay, On which you see that donkey feast away. Thus Ughtly to another : Then bent his noble head, as though To give that word the reverence due, And gently said, \" My mother ! \" THE SPIRIT OF POETRY.

Sir, I was unwilUng to interrupt the course of this debate, while it was carried on with calmness and decency, by men who do not suffer the ardour of opposition to cloud their reason, or transport them to such expressions as the dignity of this assembly does not admit. I have hitherto deferred answering the gentleman, who declaims against the bUl with such fluency and rhetoric, and such vehemence of gesture ; who charged the advocates for the expedients now proposed with having no regard to any interest but their own, and with making laws only to consume paper, and threatened them with the defection of their adherents, and the loss of their influence, upon this new discovery of their folly and their ignorance ; nor, Sir, do I now answer him for any other purpose than to remind him how little the clamour of rage and petulancy of invective contribute to the end for which this assembly is caUed together : how little the discovery of truth is promoted, and the security of the nation estabUshed, by pompous diction and theatrical emotion. In the first sense, Sir, the charge is too trifling to he confuted, and deserves to be mentioned only that it may be despised. I am at Uberty, Uke every other man, to use my own language ; and though I may perhaps have some ambition to please this gentleman, I shaU not lay myself under any restraint, nor very solicitously copy his diction or his mien, however matured by age, or modeUed by experience. But if any man shall, by charging me with theatrical behaviour, imply that I utter any sentiments but my own, I shall treat him as a calumniator and a viUain ; nor shall any protection shelter him from the treatment he deserves. I shaU on such an occasion, without scruple, trample upon aU those forms within which wealth and dignity entrench themselves, nor shaU anything but age restrain my resentment ; age, which always brings with it one privdege, that of being insolent and supercihous without punishment. Formidable sounds and furious declamation, confident assertions and lofty periods, may affect the young and inexperienced; and perhaps the gentleman may have contracted his habits of oratory by conversing more with those of his own age than with such as have more suc cessful methods of communicating their sentiments. But with regard, Sir, to those whom I have offended, I am of opinion that if I had acted a borrowed part, I should have avoided their censure ; the heat which offended them is the ardour of conviction, and that zeal for the service of my country, which neither hope nor fear shall influence me to suppress. I wiU not sit unconcerned whUe my Uberty is invaded, nor look in silence upon pubUc robbery. I wUl exert my endeavours, at whatever hazard, to repel the aggressor and drag the thief to justice, whoever may protect him in his villainy, and who ever may partake of his plunder. If the heat of his temper, Sir, would suffer him to attend to those whose age and long acquaintance with business give them an indisputable right to deference and superiority, he would learn in time to reason rather than declaim ; and to prefer justness of argument and an accurate knowledge of facts, to sounding epithets and splendid superlatives, which may disturb the imagination for a moment, but leave no lasting impression on the mind. He would learn, Sir, that to accuse and prove are very different ; and that reproaches, unsupported by evi dence, affect only the character of him that utters them. Excursions of fancy and flights of oratory are indeed pardonable in young men, but iu no other ; and it would surely contribute more, even to the purpose for which some gentlemen appear to speak (that of depreciating the conduct of the Administration), to prove the incon veniences and injustice of this biU, than barely to assert them, with whatever magnificence of language, or appear ance of zeal, honesty, or compassion. THE ASPIRATIONS OF YOUTH. Higher, higher wUl we cUmb Up the mount of glory, That our names may Uve through time In our country's story ; Happy, when her welfare calls, He who conquers, he who faUs.

Onward, onward wUl we press Through the path of duty; Virtue is true happiness, Sir, the atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honourable gentleman has with such spirit and decency charged upon me, I shall neither attempt to palliate nor deny ; but content myself with wishing that I may be one of those whose folUes may cease with their youth, and not of those who continue ignorant in spite of age and ex perience. ExceUence true beauty ; Minds are of supernal birth, Let us make a heaven of earth. Close and closer then we knit Hearts and hands together, Whether youth can be attributed to any man as a reproach, I wiU not, Sir, assume the province of deter mining; but surely age may justly become contemptible if the opportunities which it brings have passed away without improvement, and vice appear to prevail when the passions have subsided. The wretch who, after having seen the consequences of a thousand errors, continues stiU to blunder, and in whom age has only added obstinacy to stupidity, is surely the object either of abhorrence or contempt, and deserves not that his gray head should secure him from insults. Much more, Sir, is he to be abhorred who, as he has advanced in age, has receded from virtue, and become more wicked with less tempta tion, \u2014 who prostitutes himself for money which he cannot enjoy, and spends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country. But youth, Sir, is not my only crime; I have been accused of acting a theatrical part. A theatrical part Where our fireside comforts sit In the wildest weather ; Oh ! they wander wide who roaiu, For the joys of life, from home.

Methought that I had broken from the Tcwer, And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy ; And, in my company, my brother Glo'ster, Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches ; thence we look'd toward England, And cited up a thousand heavy times, During the wars of York and Lancaster, That had befaU'n us.

Then came wand'ring by A shadow like an angel, with bright hair Dabbled in blood ; and he shriek'd out aloud,\u2014 \" Clarence is come,\u2014 false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence, That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury ; Seize on him, furies, take him to your torments ! \" With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise, I trembling waked, and, for a season after, Could not beUeve but that I was in heU, But, Douglas ! whUe thus I recaU to my mind The elect of the land we shall soon leave behind, I can read in the weather-wise glance of thine eye, As it foUows the rack flitting over the. sky, That the faint coming breeze wUl be fair for our flight, And shaU steal us away, ere the faUing of night.

His colours are dull to their quick-sparkling hue ; More and more on the lady he fixes his view On the canvas he looks less and less. \" You rascaUy dauber ! \" old Beelzebub cries, \" Take heed how you wrong me again ! Though your caricatures for myself I despise, Make me handsomer now in the multitude's eyes, In vain he retouches, her eyes sparkle more, And that look which fair Marguerite gave ! Many devUs the artist had painted of yore, But he never had tried a Uve angel before, \u2014 St. Anthony, help him and save ! Or see if I threaten in vain ! \" Now the paintej was bold, and religious beside, And on faith he had certain reliance ; He yielded, alas ! for the truth must be told, To the woman, the tempter, and fate. It was settled the lady so fair to behold, Should elope from her husband so ugly and old, With the painter so pious of late. So carefuUy he the grim countenance eyed, And thank'd him for sitting with catholic pr.-r.'Z^ And sturdily bade him defiance. Betimes in the morning the painter arose, He is ready as soon as 'tis Ught. Every look, every Une, every feature he knows, 'Tis fresh in his eye, to his labour he goes, Now Satan exults in his vengeance complete, To the husband he makes the scheme known ; Night comes and the lovers impatiently meet ; And he has the old wicked one quite. Together they fly, they are seized in the street, And in prison the painter is thrown. Happy man! he is sure the resemblance can't fail; The tip of the nose is like fire, There's his grin and his fangs, and his dragon -like mail, And the very identical curl of his tail, With Repentance, his only companion, he lies, And a dismal companion is she ! On a sudden he saw the old enemy rise, So that nothing is lest to desire. \"Now, you viUainous dauber !\" Sir Beelzebub crie?, \" You are paid for your insults to me ! He looks, and retouches again with delight 'Tis a portrait complete to his mind ; \" But my tender heart you may easily move If to what I propose you agree ; That picture, \u2014 be just ! the resemblance improve ; Make a handsomer portrait, your chains I'll remove. And exulting again and again at the sight, He looks round for applause, and he sees with affright The original standing behind. And you shaU this instant be free.\" \" Fool ! idiot! \" old Beelzebub grinn'd as he spoke, And stampt on the scaffold in ire ; Overjoy' d, the conditions so easy he hears, The painter grew pale, for he knew it no joke ; 'Twas a terrible height, and the scaffolding broke, The devU could wish it no higher. \" I'U make you quite handsome ! \" he said. He said, and his chain on the devil appears ; Released from his prison, released from his fears, The painter is snug in his bed. \" Help \u2014 help ! blessed Mary ! \" he cried in alarm, As the scaffold sunk under his feet. At morn he arises, composes his look, And proceeds to his work as before ; The people beheld him, the culprit they took ; They thought that the painter his prison had broke, From the canvas the Virgin extended her arm, She caught the good painter, she saved him from harm ; There were hundreds who saw in the street. The old dragon fled when the wonder he spied, And cursed his own fruitless endeavour ; While the painter call'd after his rage to deride, Shook his paUet and brushes in triumph, and cried, \" I'll paint thee more ugly than ever ! \" And to prison they led him once more. They open the dungeon ; \u2014 behold in his place In the corner old Beelzebub lay ; He smirks and he smiles and he leers with a grace, That the painter might catch all the charms of his face, Then vanish'd in lightning away. PART SECOND. Tho painter so pious all praise had acquired For defying the malice of heU ; The monks the unerring resemblance admired Not a lady lived near but her portrait desirec Quoth the painter, \" I trust you'll suspect me no mcro, Since you find my assertions were true.

She dashed thro' the stream and she chmb'd the broad bank, With no word to urge forward, no heel to her flank ; The gate with its padlock might stand in her way, It took more than five bars to keep Black Bess at bay.

Night is the time for dreams ; The gay romance of life, I conceive it to be the duty of every educated person dosely to watch and study the time in which he Uves, and as far as in him Ues to add his humble mite of individual exertion to further the accompUshment of what he beUeves Providence to have ordained. Nobody who has paid any attention to the particular features of our present era, wiU doubt for a moment that we are living at a period of most wonderful transition, which tends rapidly to the accom pUshment of that great end to which, indeed, aU history points \u2014 the realization of the unity of mankind. Not a unity which breaks down the Umits, and levels the pecu liar characteristics of the different nations of the earth, but rather a unity the result and product of those very national varieties and antagonistic qualities. The distances which separated the different nations and parts of the globe are vanishing before the achievements of modern invention, and we can traverse them with incredible speed ; the languages of aU nations are known, and their acquire ment placed within the reach of everybody ; thought is communicated with the rapidity and even the power of Ughtning. On the other hand, the great principle of division of labour, which may be caUed the moving power of civiUzation, is being extended to aU branches of science, industry, and art. Whilst formerly the greatest mental energies strove at universal knowledge, and that know ledge was confined to the few, now they are directed to specialities, and in these again even to the minutest points ; but the knowledge acquired becomes the pro perty of the community. Whilst, formerly, discovery was wrapt in secrecy,' the pubUcity of the present day has this effect, that no sooner is a discovery or invention made than it is already improved upon, and surpassed by com peting efforts ; the products of aU quarters of the globe are placed at our disposal, and we have only to choose which is the best and cheapest for our purpose, and the powers of production are entrusted to the stimulus of competition and capital. So man is approaching a more complete fulfilment of that great and sacred mission which he has to perform in the world. His reason being created after the image of God, he has to use it to discover the laws by which the Almighty governs his creation, and by making these laws his standard of action to conquer nature to his use \u2014 himself a divine instrument. Science discovers these laws of power, motion, and transformation ; industry applies them to the raw matter which the earth yields us in abundance, but which becomes valuable only by knowledge ; art teaches us the immutable laws of beauty and symmetry, and gives to our productions forms in accordance with them. When truth that is, and truth that seems, Mix in fantastic strife : Ah ! visions, less beguiling far Than waking dreams by dayUght are ! Night is the time for tod ; To plough the classic field, Intent to find the buried spoU Its wealthy furrows yield ; TiU aU is ours that sages taught, That poets sang, and heroes wrought. Night i3 the time to weep ; To wet with unseen tears Those graves of memory, where sleep The joys of other years ; Hopes, that were angels at their birth, But died when young Uke things of earth. Night is the time to watch ; O'er ocean's dark expanse, To hail the Pleiades, or catch The full moon's earUest glance, That brings into the home-sick mind AU we have loved and lest behind. Night is the time for care ; Brooding on hours misspent, To see the spectre of despair, Come to our lonely tent ; Like Brutus, 'midst his slumbering host, Summon'd to die by C\u00e6sar's ghost. Night is the time to think ; When, from the eye, the soul Takes flight, and, on the utmost brink Of yonder starry pole, Discerns beyond the abyss of night The dawn of uncreated Ught. Night is the time to pray ; Our Saviour oft withdrew To desert mountains far away ; So wiU his foUower do, Steal from the throng to haunts untrod, A nd commune there alone with God. Night is the time for death ; When aU around is peace, Calmly to yield the weary breath, From sin and suffering cease, Think of heaven's bUss, and give the sign To parting friends ; \u2014 such death be mine. The Exhibition of 1851 has given us a true test and a Uving picture of the point of development, at which the whole of mankind has arrived in this great task, and a new starting-point from which all nations wUl be able to direct their future exertions. I confidently hope that the first impression which the view of this vast collection wiU produce upon the spectator wiU be that of deep thankul ness to the Almighty for the blessings which he has bestowed upon us already here below; and the second, the conviction that they can be realized only in proportion to the help which we are prepared to render each other ; therefore, only by peace, love, and ready assistance, not only between individuals, but between the nations of the earth. THE PRESS. Thoughts flit and flutter through the mind, As o'er the waves the shifting wind ; Trackless and traceless is their flight, As faUing stars of yesternight, Or the old tide-marks on the shore Which other tides have rippled o'er. Yet art, by Genius trained and taught, Arrests \u2014 records the fleeting thought, Stamps on the minute or the hour A lasting, an eternal power, And to mind's passing shadows givea An influence that for ever Uves. But mightiest of the mighty means, On which the arm of Progress leans, Man's noblest mission to advance, His woes assuage, his weal enhance, His rights enforce, his wrongs redress, Mightiest of mighty is the Press.

But for my whiskers, you must grant me a salvo there.\" Mounting with tireless wing on every wind, And filling earth with sweetest minstrelsy. THE CAPTAIN'S WHISKERS. A certain Swiss Captain of Grenadiers, whose company nad been cashiered, was determined, since Mars had no more employment for him, to try if he could not procure a commission in the corps of Venus ; or, in other words, if he could not get a wife : and as he had no money of his own he reasoned, and reasoned very justly, it was quite necessary his intended should have enough for them both. The captain wa3 one of those kind of heroes to whom the epithet hectoring blade might readUy be apphed ; he was nearly six feet high, with a long sword, and fiercely formed hat ; add to which, he was aUowed to have the most martial pair of whiskers of any grenadier in the com pany to which he belonged. To curl these whiskers, to comb and twist them round his fore-finger, and to admire them in the glass, formed the chief occupation and deUght of his Use. A man of these accomplishments, with the ad dition of bronze and rhodomontades, of which he had a superfluity, stands at aU times, and in aU countries, a good chance with the ladies, as the experience of I know not how many thousand years has confirmed. Accordingly, aster a diUgent attention and artful inquiry, a young lady was found, exactly such a one as we may weU suppose a per son with his views would be glad to find. She was tolerably handsome, not more than three-and-twenty, with a good fortune ; and, what was the best part of the story, this fortune was entirely at her own disposal. Our captain, who thought now or never was the time, having first found means to introduce himself as a suitor, was incessant in his endeavours to carry his cause. His tongue was eternally running in praise of her super-super lative, never-to-be-described charms; and in the hyper bohcal account of the flames, darts, and daggers, by which his lungs, Uver, and midriff, were burnt up, transfixed, and gnawn away. He who in writing a song to his sweet heart, described his heart to be without one drop of gravy like an overdone mutton chop, was a fool at a simile when compared to our hero. \"And why so, good captain? Surely any gentleman who had but the tithe part of the passion you express, would not stand upon such a trifle.\" \" A trifle, madam ? my whiskers a trifle ? no, madam, no ! my whiskers are no trifle. Had I but a single regiment of feUows whiskered like me, I myself would be the Grand Turk of Constantinople. My whiskers, madam, are the last things I should have supposed you would have wished me to sacrifice. There is not a woman, married or single, maid, wife, or widow, that does not admire my whiskers,\" \"Maybe so, sir; but if yon marry me, you must cut them off.\" \" And is there no other way ? Must I never hope to be happy with you unless I part with my whiskers ? \" \" Never.\" \" Why then, madam, fareweU : I would not part with a single hair of my whiskers, if Catharine the Czarina, em press of aU the Russias, would make me king of the Cal mueks; and so good morning to you.\" , Had aU the young ladies in like circumstances equal penetration, they might generaUy rid themselves with equal ease of the interested and unprincipled coxcombs by whom they are pestered. They aU have their whiskers, and seek for fortunes, to be able to cultivate, not cut them off. THE WEE MAN. It was a merry company, And they were just afloat, When lo ! a man of dwarfish span, Came up and haU'd the boat. One day, as he was ranting, kneeUng, and beseeching his goddess to send him an errand to pluck the diamond from the nose of the Great Mogul, and present it to her divinityship, or suffer him to step and steal the empress of China's enchantment shnper, or the queen of Sheba's \" Good morrow to ye, gentle folks, And wUl you let me in ?

I DREAJIT of love, I dreamt of love, and doted on my dream, Night held her sullen reign : thick gathering olouds Obscured the horizon's face, and darkness spread Her sable wings o'er all the arch of heaven. My way was through a rugged wilderness, With pits, and snares, and piercing flints and thorns, Thickly bestrewn. Awhile I wandered wild And wearily, tor not one glimmering star Sent forth its feeble rays. The wan, pale moon Was lost ; and all her glittering host were gone : Though ever and anon the treacherous glare Of ignis faiuus, from surrounding fens, Allured me from my path, then rose aloft, And vanished into air. 'Twas a sad way, A fearful way, and my poor trembling soul 'Was heart-sick of her journey. I did pause And ponder oft ; lor savage beasts howled loud, And ravens croaked, and swift destruction seemed To encompass me around ; nor knew I thence Which way to turn. At length a meteor rose, Bright gleaming in the east. 'Twas Science called ; And swift through heaven it bent its fiery course, Illumining the thick embodied clouds, And gathering all around a train of light, Allured me to pursue. I followed on The way it took ; and brighter it appeared The nearer I approached, until my feet Were wearied ; and my dazzled eyes grew dim, And all was darkness. Then again I stayed, And paused, and pondered, and did ruminate On all the way it led me ; for I wished To retrace my steps, but vainly strove to find The path by which I came. At length arose Another meteor, paler than the first, And lovelier far ; for purer was its light, And smoother seemed its course. 'Twas silvery white. By mortals it was called Philosophy ; For to my heart of trusting faith a beacon did it seem ; A soul th' Eternal's breath had fit, a pulse of living fire, Whose throb went through the universe, and never could expire. Too soon I found, too soon I found, the vision could not last\u2014 'Twas human, 'twas a mockery, \u2014 my dream of bliss was past : [there, The lightning was within my heart, and left but ashes Then came a voice upon my soul \u2014 \" Where is thy day- dream, where . \" I dreamt of fame, I dreamt of fame,\u2014 a dream of glorious pride ; A thousand voices hail'd me \" great ! \" in one impetuous tide; A thousand spirits bend to mine, a thousand greetings poured, To hail me as their idol-one, their spirif s sceptred lord ; But soon my heart was parch'd with light, and thirsted for the stream Of peace and love, that could not five beneath that fiery beam; My soul was sick with glare and praise, and panted for the rest The weary spirit finds alone in some fond human breast : I turned with loathing from the sound of praise that round me rose, I would have given it all for that sweet voice affeotion knows ; I rush'd to solitude to hide my writhing heart's despair, And through the gloom those accents thrill' d \u2014 \" Where is thy day-dream, where ? \" I dreamt of heaven, I dreamt of heaven, \u2014 my agony was stilled, [thrilled \u2014 And to my eyes far more alluring seemed Than Science\u2014 glairing star. Again my feet In swift pursuit careered. Tts chosen track Seemed fair and gentle through the firmament, And easy 'twas to trace, till all at once It vanished in the clouds, and darkness reigned. Deep horrors seized my soul ; for now I found - On either hand a mighty swelling surge Beat high against my path, and heaven's black arch Muttered harsh threatenings of a boisterous storm. I stood and trembled ; pregnant with despair, Earth shook, air groaned, and darkness blacker grew ; Whilst the big waves beat o'er my feet, as though Intent to swallow me. My ancles smote A voice of comfort and of peace my inmost spirit A murmur like a mother's voice, when on her shielding breast She soothes the wild and passionate cry of infancy to rest The whirlwind of my soul was hush'd, my heart's dark tempest flown, It seem'd as though a pitying hand had claim'd me for its own, Had hush'd the fever of my brain, had sooth'd my wild despair, And murmur'd with its voice of love \u2014 \" Where are thy sorrows, where ? \" Against each other. On my knees I sunk And breathed a fervent prayer. Still higher rose The gathering waves ; still louder roared the storm, Deep broke the thunder in tremendous peals, And forked coruscations shed their glare To show my danger more. I ran and prayed, And shrieked, and groaned, and did uplift my hands In supplication to a throne of grace, MARY, THE MAID OF THE INN. Who is yonder poor maniac, whose wildly-fix'd eyes Seem a heart overcharged to express ? She weeps not, yet often and deeply she sighs ; She never complains, but her silence implies The composure of settled distress. No pity she looks for, no alms doth she seek ; Nor for raiment nor food doth she care : But seemed to lift in vain ; for still the more I prayed, the more my furious foes pursued To drag me to destruction ; till, from heaven, Jehovah's mighty voice exclaimed, \"Fear not, Through her tatters the winds of the winter blow bleak On that wither\" d breast, and her weather-worn cneek Hath the hue of a mortal despair."], [77, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 59 Behind a wide column, half breathless with fear, She crept, to conceal herself there : Yet cheerful and happy, nor distant the day, Poor Mary the Maniac hath been ; That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear. And she saw in the moonlight two ruffians appear, And between them a corpse did they bear. The traveller remembers who journey'd this way No damsel so lovely, no damsel so gay, As Mary, the Maid of the Inn. Then Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle cold; Again the rough wind hurried by, \u2014 It blew off the hat of the one, and behold Even close to the feet of poor Mary it roll'd,\u2014 She felt, and expected to die. Her cheerful address fill'd the guests with delight As she welcomed them in with a smile ; Her heart was a stranger to childish affright, And Mary would walk by the Abbey at night When the wind whistled down the dark aisle. \"Curse the hat!\" he exclaims: \"Come on till we hide The dead body,\" his comrade replies. She loved, and young Richard had settled the day, And she hoped to be happy for Use. She beholds them in safety pass on by her side, She seizes the hat, fear her courage supplied, And fast through the Abbey she flies. But Richard was idle and worthless, and they Who knew him would pity poor Mary, and say That she was too good for his wife. She ran with wild speed, she rush'd in at the door, She gazed in her terror around, Then her limbs could support their faint burthen no more, And exhausted and breathless she sank on the floor. Unable to utter a sound. 'Twas in autumn, and stormy and dark was the night, And fast were the windows and door ; Two guests sat enjoying the fire that burnt bright, And smoking in silence with tranquil delight They listen'd to hear the wind roar. Ere yet her pale lips could the story impart, For a moment the hat met her view ; \u2014 Her eyes from that object convulsively start, For what a cold horror then thrilled through her heart When the name of her Richard she knew ! \"'Tis pleasant,\" cried one, \" seated by the fireside, To hear the wind whistle without.\" \" What a night for the Abbey ! \" his comrade replied, \" Methinks a man's courage would now be well tried Who should wander the ruins about. Where the old Abbey stands, on the esmmon hard by, His gibbet is now to be seen ; His irons you still from the road may espy ; The traveller beholds them, and thinks with a sigh Of poor Mary, the Maid of the Inn. \"I myself, like a schoolboy, should tremble to hear The hoarse ivy shake over my head ; And could fancy I saw, half persuaded by fear, Some ugly old abbot's grim spirit appear, For this wind might awaken the dead ! \" \" I'll wager a dinner,\" the other one cried, \" That Mary would venture there now.\" \" Then wager and lose ! \" with a sneer he replied, \" I'll warrant she'd fancy a ghost by her side, And faint if she saw a white cow.\" OLD WINTER. Who's he that comes yonder enthroned in the storm ? So hoarse in his voice, so forbidding in form ? His garments how white ! and his visage how pale ! His helmet the snow-flake \u2014 his weapon the hail ! And icicles, fresh as from glacial rocks, \" Will Mary this charge on her courage allow ? \" His companion exclaim' d, with a smile; \" I shall win, \u2014 for I know she will venture there now, And earn a new bonnet by bringing a bough From the elder that grows in the aisle.\" Behold how they hang from his hoary old locks ! The wee tiny children are flocking to see Whoever this fearful old stranger can be ! 'Tis Winter, \"Old Winter,\" I know by his pace, And the light that reflects from his frosty old face ! With fearless good humour did Mary comply, And her way to the Abbey she bent ; The night was dark, and the wind was high, And as hollowly howling it swept through the sky, She shiver'd with cold as she wens. He walketh abroad while we slumber and dream, Curls up the green herbage, and glazeth the stream ; He baketh the glebe, and he blanches the hills, He curdles the fountains, and crusteth the rills ; Lays bare the deep forest, and withers the flower, Dissolves the old ruin, and batters the tower ; He waveth his wand amidst beauty and worth, And scatters the wreck o'er the face of the earth ! \" Old Winter \" rules over land, ocean, and sea \u2014 And a potent magician and laird is he !

My hands are brown and withered now, Once they were shapely and white ; And the hair is silver round my brow, That once had a golden light.

For then what a happy face looked out From this chamber window small, \u2014 On ! that the desert were my dwelling-place, With one fair spirit for my minister, That I might all forget the human race, And, hating no one, love but only her !

Though with them to converse can rarely be our lot.

I was young and passing fair, they said, But I laughed their words to scorn ; When they told that life must even for me Hold many a piercing thorn. For a goodly troop of friends were mine, And their love and truth were weighed By my own exhaustless heart, that ne'er Was of time or change afraid. There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, There is a rapture on the lonely shore, There is society where none intrudes, By the deep sea, and music in its roar ; I love not man the less, but nature more, From these our interviews, in which I steal From all I may be, or have been before, To mingle with the universe, and feel What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal. And its trusting truth was blessed, for though A few summer friends passed by, When dark days came, and amongst them one Who had sworn for me to die.

Yet, though he changed with the cruel world, The deep anguish of that day Was stilled by a hand that holds us fast When earth's frail supports give way. I blamed him not, if the love he gave Was only a summer flower ; It gladden'd and purified my life From all self's consuming power. And his name has never left my prayers, I forget that his love is gone ; For mine in its deep, unchanging might, Seems to make him all my own. His steps are not upon thy paths, \u2014 thy fields Are not a spoil for him, \u2014 thou dost arise And shake him from thee ; the vile strength he wields For earth's destruction thou dost all despise, Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies, And send'st him shivering in thy playful spray, And howling, to his gods, where haply lies On earth we shall never meet again, 'Tis better it should be so ; I am so chang'd, he would greet me now, With a stranger's gaze, I know.

Like some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form, Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm ; Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread, Eternal sunshine settles on its head. A proud, heroic band, Against a host of mutineers * Determined make their stand ; Brave Gordon, and as gallant Skene, A stout defence maintain, And onward as their foes advance, They tread on heaps of slain.

They courted death, and gladly sought A refuge in the tomb, Lest foul dishonour and disgrace Should be their wretched doom.

God, yet more Than our spirits true and bold ; And our mighty mountain sentinels, upon the owner of the bull brought his action agaiDst the boat for running away with the bull\u2014 the owner of the boat brought his action against the bull for running away with the boat. And thus notice of trial was given, Bullum versus Boatum, Boatum versus Bullum. Now the counsel for the bull began with saying : \" My lord, and you, gentlemen of the jury, we are counsel in this cause for the bull. We are indicted for running away with the boat. Now, my lord, we have heard of run ning horses, but never of running bulls before. Now, my lord, the bull could no more run away with the boat than a man in a coach may be said to run away with the horses ; therefore, my lord, how can we punish what is not punishable? How can we eat what is not eatable ? Or how can we drink what is not drinkable ? Or, as the law says, how can we think on what is not thinkable ? Therefore, my lord, as we are counsel in this cause for the bull, if the jury should bring the bull in guilty, the jury would be guilty of a bull/' The counsel for the boat observed that the bull should be nonsuited, because, in his declaration, he had not speci fied what colour he was of; for thus wisely, and thus learnedly, spoke the counsel : \" My lord, if the bull was of no colour, he must be of some colour ; and, if he was not of any colour, what colour could the bull be of ? \" I overruled this motion myself, by observing the bull was a white bull, and that white is no colour ; besides, as I told my brethren, they should not trouble their heads to talk of colour in the law, for the law can colour anything. Thi3 cause being afterwards left to a reference, upon the award, both bull and boat were acquitted, it being proved that the tide of the river carried them both away ; upon which, I gave it as my opinion that, as the tide of the river carried both bull and boat away, both bull and boat had a good action against the waiter-bailiff. Those watohers stern and old \u2014 The shadow of a glorious past Our memory doth enfold. That little band of shepherd men, Who left their flocks with thee, And, strong in heart, went boldly forth To make our mountains free \u2014 Thy hand was with their stedfast worth, And they won the victory. And they, the saints of later time, Who dwelt in places lone, And wandering exiles for their faith, Through toil and famine, fight, and death, Their martyr-crowns have won, \u2014 'Twas thou received their fleeting breath, And they sit beneath thy throne Forsake us not, but as of old So let our spirits be ; And give us still the courage bold To keep our mountains free ; And our ancestral faith to hold, Wherewith we worship thee. The cattle on a thousand hills, The feeble and the small \u2014 We leave throughout the silent night, Nor fear lest harm befall ; For thou who blest the patriarch's store, Wilt guard and keep them all. Praise from the mountain's lordly crest, Praise from the valley lone, My opinion being taken, an action was issued; and, upon the traverse, this point of law arose : How, where fore, and whether, why, when, and what, whatsoever, whereas, and whereby, as the boat was not a com-pos-men tis evidence, how could an oath be administered ? That point was soon settled by Boatum's attorney declaring that, for his client, he would swear anything. The water-bailiff's charter was then read, taken out of the original record, in true law Latin, which set forth in their declaration that they were carried away either by the tide of flood, or the tide of ebb. The charter of the water-bailiff was as follows : Aqu\u00e6 bailiffi est inagistratus in choisi super omnibus fcshibus qui habuerunt jinnos et scalos, clawos, shellos, et talos, qui swimmareinfreshibus, vel saltibus, riveris, lakis, pondAs, canalibus, et well boats : sive oysteri, prawni, ivhitini, shrimpi, tuirbutus solus ; that is, not turbots alone, but turbots and soles both together. But now comes the nicety of the law ; the law is as nice as a new-laid egg, and not to be under stood by addle-headed people. Bullum and Boatum men tioned both ebb and flood to avoid quibbling; but it being proved that they were carried away neither by. the tide of flood nor by the tide of ebb, but exactly upon the top of high water, they were nonsuited ; but such was the lenity of the court, upon their paying all costs, they were allowed to begin again, de novo.

Law is law \u2014 law is law ; and as in such and so forth and hereby, and aforesaid, provided always, nevertheless, notwithstanding. Law is like a country dance : people are led up and down in it till they are tired. Law is like a book of surgery : there are a great many desperate cases in it. It is also like physic : they that take the least of it are best off. Law is like a homely gentlewoman: very well to follow. Law is also like a scolding wife : very bad when it follows us. Law is like a new fashion : people are bewitched to get into it. It is also like bad weather : most people are glad when they get out of it. We shall now mention a cause, called \" Bullum versus Boatum:\" it was a cause that came before me. The cause was as follows. There were two farmers : farmer A. and farmer B. Farmer A. was seized or possessed of a bull : farmer B was seized or possessed of a ferry boat. Now, the owner of the ferry boat, having made his boat fast to a post on shore, with a piece of hay, twisted rope-fashion, or, as we gay, vulgo vocato, a hay-band. After he had made his boat fast to a post on shore, as it was very natural for a \"lungry man to do, he went up town to dinner : farmer A.'s bull, as it was very natural for a hungry bull to do, oame down town to look for a dinner ; and, observing, dis covering, seeing, and spying out some turnips in the bot tom of the ferry-boat, the bull scrambled into the ferry boat ; he ate up the turnips, and, to make an end of his meal, fell to work upon the hay-band : the boat, being eaten from its moorings, floated down the river, with the bull in it ; it struck against a rock, beat a hole in the bottom of the boat, and tossed the bull overboard ; where- FAITHLESS SALLY BROWN.

No. 9."], [84, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 66 Below was one smooth, glittering sheet, That crisp'd and crack'd beneath my feet, No springing herd, no daisied sod, All barren, joyless, and untrod. My dog was fawning at my side, Unwearied by my rapid ride, But I rebuked his greeting bound That scattered choking dust around. The hasty prayer, the hopeless groan, The stripling sea-boy's gurgling tone, Shrieking, amid the flood and foam, The names of mother, love, and home 5 The jarring clash that wakes the land, When blade to blade and hand to hand, Unnumber'd voices burst and swell, In one unceasing war-whoop yell ; The trump of discord ringing out, The clamour strife, the victor shout ; My breath was faint, my skin was dry, The little moisture in my eye Served but to scald ; the striking beams Oh ! these are noises any ear Will dread to meet and quail to hear ; Fell on my form like lava streams. What hideous change ! I, who had known The sickening splendour of a throne, I, humbled wretch, was craving now But let the earth or waters pour The loudest din, or wildest roar ; Let Anarchy's broad thunders roll, And Tumult do its worst to thrill, A moment's shadow for my brow. There is a silence to the soul, More awful and more startling still. Thus to be left on such a spot Appeared the climax of my lot ; Death hover'd there in such gaunt shape, To hear our very breath intrude Upon the boundless solitude, That Hope scarce whisper' d of escape ; Where mortal tidings never come But I was not in fitting state To weigh the chances of my fate. I wended on with hasty stride, 'Twixt torrid earth and brazen sky, With busy feet, or human hum ; All hush'd above, beneath, around \u2014 No stirring form, no whispered sound\u2014 This is a loneliness that falls Reckless of all that might betide, To meet the worst, to live or die. Upon the spirit, and appals More than the mingled rude alarms, But some conjecture, quick and wild, Flash'd sudden o'er me, and beguiled To flattering hope. I vaguely guess'd That nigh the desert in the west, A city stood. That thought inspired And held me on awhile untired. Arising from a world in arms. This is a silence bids us shrink, As from a precipice's brink ; But ye will rarely meet it, save In the hot desert, or cold grave. Cut off from life and fellow-men, This silence was around me then ; I doubted if my wasting strength Could last the unknown, burning length ; It might ; yet, oh ! 'twas fearful risk To toil between the blazing disk 'Twas horrible ; but once again I dragg'd along the scorching plain, Till the consuming orb of day Shot down the close meridian ray. Of eastern sun and shining sand, With lips unmoisten'd, cheek unfann'd ; 'Twas frightful ordeal, but yet Dire evils pass, if boldly met. Exhausted nature now had done Its utmost 'neath a desert sun, And moments of delirium came; I will not tire thy patient ear With tedious detail of my woe, But bring my rambling speech to bear On that I wish thee most to know. A staggering weakness seized my frame, My feet refused their task \u2014 when, lo ! My gaze met Many a minaret ! A city rose ; 'twas nigh ; but, oh ! The beacon star now shone in vain, Though short the space, I ne'er could gaia Hour after hour brought on the night, With something less of heat and Ught, You may believe I was outworn, And trembling, famished, and forlorn ; I flung me on the dewless ground, And fast and bitter tears I wept, Till, pillow'd on my faithful hound, That other league. My limbs, my heart, All fail'd ; I felt my sinews start With the last shudder of despair, And Hope expired \u2014 my grave was there. Like a tired child, I sobb'd and slept. Slumber like mine wrought little good, I started as the sun uprose, And fancied that my boiling blood Had gather'd torture from repose I felt my temples glow and beat With faster pulse and fiercer heat ; I would have wept again, but now My very tears refused to flow. 'Twas thirst, 'twas maddening thirst alone. That wrung my spirit's inward groan ; Hunger is bitter, but the worst Of human pangs, the most accursed Of want's fell scorpions, is thirst. I look'd upon this precious ring, That few beside a king could buy, What was its value ? would it bring A cup of water ? No ! its gleam, That flash'd back to the brazen beam, But taunted with its brilliancy. I woke \u2014 I lived, to meet, to bear With famine, thirst, and blank despair ; I cast my eager, straining eye From sky to sand, from sand to sky ; No, no relief ; my hound and I Were all that broke the vacancy. My strange distemper' d fancy wrought The doom of Tantalus ; for naught Broke on my frantic, waking dream But the deep well and purling stream ; Distorted vision conjur'd near, All that is cool, fresh, moist, and clear 5 I saw the crystal fountain play In leaping sheets of snowy spray : The whirling blast, the breaker's dash, The snapping ropes, the parting crash, The sweeping waves that boil and lash, The stunning peal, the hissing flash,"], [85, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 67 I heard the undulating wa_re Of the swift river, gush and lave ; I saw the dew on grass and flower $ I heard the gentle summer shower, Upon that mangled, raw repast, My hands, my teeth, all tearing fast ; Had you beheld my dry lips drain The current from each reeking vein, You might have guessed how human pain Can wring and madden human brain. With its soft pattering bubbles drip j I heard the dashing waterfall\u2014 Oh ! it was cruel mockery all ! I laughed, and then my shrunken lip Oozed thicken'd gore ; with upraised hand, I sunk upon the shining sand, My dry lips met Food fresh and wet, No nectar half so sweet or fresh ; Oh ! it was rare Delicious fare ! I never quaffed Such luscious draught, A. Maker's mercy to implore. I fervently invoked a name. Which, I confess, with much of shame, I'd rarely call'd upon before. Nor tasted viand like that flesh. It soothed my pulse, it cool'd my eye, It quenched the fire upon my brow 5 It gave me breath, strength, energy, And, looking to the city nigh, My glance was for a moment thrown Toward the heaven I address' d, But the fierce rays came rushing down Upon my brow With furnace glow, Dense, lurid, red, Till my smote head I felt that I could reach it now. Could I do less than kneel and bless My Saviour in the wilderness ? But what will all of speech avail ? The choicest eloquence would fail Such wild emotion to express. The feeling that absorbed my heart Was of that deep entrancing kind Which doth defy the lips to find A fitting language to impart Fell, faint and stricken, on my breast. Thus while I knelt, my hound look'd up\u2014 Fate was about to give the last, The o'erflowing drop to misery's cup- He started, fled, and bounded fast. Its glowing zeal and passionate start. My lips would falter to discuss The glow he kindled in my breast ; Oh ! what a moment, all the past Was blended in that little space.

Like arrow from the string he flew, Right on \u2014 he lessened to my view\u2014 'Twas o'er ; he vanish'd from my sight ; I breath'd his name, and groan' d outright. I was alone, My dog had gone \u2014 He that I deem'd the firmly true- DOMESTIC HAPPINESS. In joyous youth, what soul hath never known Thought, feeling, taste, harmonious to its own ? Who hath not paused while beauty's pensive eye Ask'd from his heart the homage of a sigh ? Who hath not own'd, with rapture-smitten frame, The power of grace, the magic of a name ? In the last hour he left me too. I saw no more ; I snatch' d my breath Like those who meet a drowning death ; One cry of hopeless agony There be, perhaps, who barren hearts avow, Cold as the rocks on Torneo's hoary brow ; There be, whose loveless wisdom never failed, In self-adoring pride securely mailed : \u2014 But triumph not, ye peace-enamoured few ! Fire, nature, genius, never dwelt with you ! For you no fancy consecrates the scene Where rapture uttered vows, and wept between ; 'Tis yours, unmoved, to sever and to meet ; No pledge is sacred, and no home is sweet ! Who that would ask a heart to dullness wed, The waveless calm, the slumber of the dead ! No ; the wild bliss of Nature needs alloy, And fear and sorrow fan the fire of joy !

No more of this ; I only, know I felt strange pressure on my brow ; The world was not ; I can but tell, That, senseless, lone, and blind, I full. The next that memory can mark, Is of a clear and deep-toned bark ; Sense tardily came back, I woke Beneath a gentle, pawing stroke ; I gazed with wild and doubting stare\u2014 My dog ! my noble dog was there ! It was my Murkim that I saw, With blood, wet blood, upon his jaw. What sight for eyes like mine to meet !

The world was sad ! the garden was a wild ! And man, the hermit, sigh'd \u2014 till woman smil^l To play the epicure in food ; I waited not to think on what That prey might be, nor whence 'twas got.

This morning Papers of state he sent me to peruse, Therein illustrated. The honour of it Does pay the act of it ; as, i' the contrary, The foulness is the punishment. I presume That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you, My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more On you than any ; so your hand and heart, Your brain, and every function of your power, Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty, As 'twere in love's particular, be more As I required ; and, wot you, what I found There ; on my conscience put unwillingly ?

I am an actor, but I have never had a very public engagement, although I have appeared at several extensive private theatricals. I flatter myself I possess a good figure, and indeed I know I have a commanding and majestic bearing, and can look exceedingly like a hero ! I am above the middle height, and well made in proportion, fine, expressive, open coun tenance, adorned with whiskers, etc., a la mode. I am told I possess physique, and that is the main thing for a heavy tragedian such as I consider myself to be. I hav e a good voice, loud, deep, and sonorous. In fine, I claim all the requisite quaUties of an eminent actor ; such qual ities as, when fully developed before a public tribunal, must be pronounced par excellence. I require an engage ment at a first-rate London theatre, but I have been un. successful in trying to obtain one, though nothing has been wanting on my part to attain that great desideratum. \" 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. \" I feel con fident I should make a good Hamlet, or Othello, as good as any tragedian at the present time on the stage ; but the conventional rule as to its being necessary for an actor to achieve provincial fame previous to appearing before a London audience is insurmountable ; or else, having to work the best part of my life, by playing obscure and mediocre characters, before a manager wiU venture to en gage me. I want to dash off, and do the grand suddenly, taking the whole theatrical world by a perfect storm. I admit the fact, that to become a good actor requires un tiring and incessant study, and practical stage knowledge ; but I have practised ever since I was a boy,andlatterly,have reverted to my boyish practice before the pier-glass. As to study, why, I have studied very much indeed ; so much so, that my mother has frequently considered me on the brink of insanity, when I have been rehearsing most violently in the drawing-room ! In studying the character of OtheUo, I have devoted many hours and paid particular attention to contortions of the face ; and I have attained a degree of exceUence which I consider decidedly heroic, but which my mother designated most horrible. It is some years ago now, but I remember weU the frightful, though to me noble and satisfactoy expressions I practised, and at which I was frequently and suddenly caught at by my mother ; but I have continued it up to the present time, and therefore, if practice makes perfect, I am in imitable in facial expression. I take in the Imperial Speaker, which contains a choice selection of my most favourite readings, etc. I am now a single young man lodger, having engaged a large room (the highest and best in the house) in the immediate suburbs of London. This room is very suitable to my requirements, and there I study my favourite characters, and meditate and muse upon the sunny and starry futureiof my theatrical career. When rehearsing Hamlet, I feel mamlf really to be Hamlet, I take his griefs and troubles to nfy own breast, I feel his feelings, and often startle my landlady with a violent burst of grief, thus : \u2014 And the white canoe of my dear ? \" He saw the lake, and a meteor bright Quick over its surface play'd ; \" Welcome,\" he said, \" my dear one's light !\" And the dim shore echoed for many a night The name of the death-cold maid. \u00bb Till he hoHow'd a boat of the birchen bark, Which carried him off from shore ; Far, far he foUow'd the meteor spark \u2014 The wind was high, and the clouds were dark, And the boat return'd no more. But oft, from the Indian hunter's camp, This lover and maid so true, Are seen at the hour of midnight damp To cross the lake by a fire-fly lamp, And paddle their white canoe. THE THAMES. Let the Rhine be blue and bright In its path of Uquid Ught, Where the red grapes fling a beam Of glory on the stream ; Let the gorgeous beauty there Mingle all that's rich and fair ; Yet to me it ne'er could be Like that river great and free, The Thames ! the mighty Thames ! Though it bear no azure wave, Though no pearly foam may lave, Or leaping cascades pour Their rainbows on its shore ; Yet I ever loved to dweU Where I heard its gushing sweU ; And never skimmed its breast, But I warmly praised and blest The Thames ! the mighty Thames 1 Can ye find in aU the world A braver flag unfurl'd Than that which floats above The stream I sing and love ? Oh ! what a burning glow Has thriUed my breast and brow, To see that proud flag come With glory to its home, The Thames ! the mighty Thames !

My landlady i3 now getting accustomed to these sudden outbursts; she wUl even come and hear me expound the third act of OtheUo, or the trial scene from the Merchant of Venice (both given from memory), and I know she appreciates my labours. She was very pleased with my rendering, as they tern it, of the part where Othello puts Iago to the test, thus : \u2014 They say the mountain child Oft loves his torrent wild So well, that should he part, He breaks his pining heart ; He grieves with smother'd sighs TiU his wearing spirit dies : And so I yearn to thee, Thon river of the free, My own, my native Thame3 !"], [90, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 72 If thou dost slander her, and torture me, f Never pray more ! abandon all remorse I On horror's head horrors accumulate !

She always appeared visibly affected at thi3, and I truly startled her when I added a Uttle of OtheUo's last speech, about blowing among winds, steeping in sulphur, and washing in gulfs of Uquid fire ! Why it was she seemed pleased with my readings I hardly know, but she was a woman of some education, and yet at times s;_ie -laughed when I was in the midst of the most imps, ssioned and heartrending scenes. \" Could I cut such a ludicrous figure as aU that ? \" But tears are akin to laughter ; I suppose it was so in her case. I suspect other ambitious amateur actors are capable of producing the like effects ; indeed, I am told they invariably do so. It is a pity, and \" pity 'tis, 'tis true :\" on one occasion, an immediate neighbour in quired of my landlady if I Were not violently disposed, and whether I yelled and shouted when she appUed to me for rent ! This information was imparted to me by my land lady, and somewhat shocked my nervous system, happily pretty strong. But, studying so excessively, I reaUy do reply theatrically to the questions of my landlady. For instance, on one occasion, when she was rather too impor tunate for rent, I started up from my chair, seized the poker, and when she stood in horror at the door, I ex pounded to the very pitch of my stentorian voice \u2014 Now as they bore him off the field, Said he, \" Let others shoot, For here I leave my second leg, And the Forty -second Foot ! \" Now Ben he loved a pretty maid, Her name was NeUy Gray ; So he went to pay her his devours, When he devoured his pay. But when he caUed on NeUy Gray, She made him quite a scoff; And when she saw his wooden legs, Began to take them off ! \"Oh! NeUy Gray; oh! NeUy Gray, Is this your love so warm ? The love that loves a scarlet coat Should be more uniform.\" Said she, \" I loved a soldier once, For he was blythe and brave ; But I wUl never have a man With both legs in the grave ! Avaunt ! and quit my sight ! Let the earth hide thee ! \" Before you had those timber toes, Your love I did allow ; Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold ! Thou hast too much speculation in those eyes But then, you know, you stand upon Another footing now ! \" \"Which thou dost glare with ! \" Thou'lt find no rent In me ! \" The startling effect of this may be better imagined than described. \" Oh ! Nelly Gray ; oh ! NeUy Gray, For all your jeering speeches, At duty's caU I left my legs In Badajos's breaches ! \" I am a midnight student over the mighty bard, and I want to place myself before the pubUc in one of my great and favourite tragic characters. I am efficient and grand in Hamlet, Othello^ Macbeth, Richard the Third, etc., but which mentiij^RC-feharacters I have deeply studied ; yet my repertoire consists of a very extensive range of characters : indeed, I excel in tragedy, and I am verygood in comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical pastoral, scene individable, or poem unUmited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light : therefore, I am not exclusively a tragedian, but, in every sense of the word, a general-utihty gentleman. Yet, notwithstanding, I beUeve I am destined for high tragedy ; nature has in tended me for a hero, such as OtheUo ; I feel OtheUo's real workings, perhaps, more acutely, inasmuch as I have been jilted myself, though he wasn't but thought he was ! It would be undissombled passion with me. I could do the bedchamber scene first-rate; I have rehearsed it so often that I have attained perfection : and in Richard the Third I think I should shine particularly in the tent scene of \" Give me another horse ! \" \" Bind up my wounds ! \" etc. which I feel certain would produce hurricanes of applause. In Hamlet I should be grand, in Macbeth noble, in Othello heroic, and in Richard the Third startling, yet kingly, cunning, and majestic. Having therefore set my life upon a cast, I shall never say die. I am working onward and onward, until I ultimately appear at a leading theatre as leading tragedian. My ambition leads me to the stage, and though dark clouds at present enshroud the sun of my existence, they must ere long disperse, and the sun of Norval Douglas Brown wiU splendidly shine forth over tho theatrical world, beaming with lasting fame and glory ! \" Why, then,\" said she, \" you've lost the feet Of legs in war's alarms, And now you cannot wear your shoes Upon your feats of arms.\" \" Oh ! false and fickle NeUy Gray, I know why you refuse ; Though I've no feet\u2014 some other man Is standing in my shoes. \" I wish I ne'er had seen your face, But now, a long farewell ! For you wiU be my death ; alas ! You wiU not be my Nell ! \" Now, when he went from NeUy Gray, His heart so heavy got, And life was such a burden grown, It made him take a knot. So round his melancholy neck A rope he did entwine, And, for his second time in life, EnUsted in the Line. One end he tied around a beam, And then removed his pegs, And, as his legs were off, of course, He soon was off his legs. And there he hung, till he was dead As any nail in town ; For, though distress had cut him up, It could not cut him down. TRUE NOBILITY.

They met in youth, ere yet the world had thrown, Its withering influence o'er their hearts. They Wd With that pure passion we but once can feel, When yet the bosom, fresh from nature's mint, UnchiU'd by contact with the duU, cold world, Throbs with that rapturous bliss age never knows. They were aU to each other. Days to them Were but as moments ; on its wing'd career The mulberry tree, by my childhood's home, Time has not altered its summer bloom ! I love that tree, for its massy shade Chequered the lawn when a boy I played ; Years have gone by , but that mulberry tree Seems like a dear old friend to me. And I never look on one of its kind, But the past and its feehngs are brought to mind : Hopes which are perished, and pleasures flown, Friends who have left me to weep alone \u2014 Time fleeted swiftly by ; and every hour, Deep-fraught with bliss, still brought some new delight. Far from the haunts of men they pass'd their hours, But not in soUtude. By them a voice Come like a dream o'er my memory, When I gaze on that dark-leaved mulberry tree. Was found in every passing gale that breath'd Its fragrance round them ; with the mountain stream, And gentle rUl meandering through the vale, And midnight sky, and joyous glance of day. With nature's varied charms they converse held ; These spake a language felt, though undefin'd. This was the sunny portion of their life. For hours I've sat mid its glossy leaves, LuUed by those sounds which the light breeze weaves, Carving a name on the moss-green bough, A name stUl dear, for it thriUs me now As in days of yore, when I loved to be Alone 'mid the shade of the mulberry tree. Alas ! that love should ever find a tomb, Even in the breast where once its altar blazed ! But thus it is ; the strong desire of gain, Ambition, pride, and aU those deadly Uls, Those master passions of the soul, poUute Love's shrine, and quench its haUow'd flame. Days of my youth, ye come, ye come, On an old man's heart from oblivion's tomb ; And ye wear once more a bright fresh hue, Like the tints of a flower when moist with dew ; And in fancy's mirror methinks I see They parted in the spring-tide of their hopes. A thousand vows were utter' d, intermix'd With words of praise, so grateful from the lips Of those we love. Ye, whose cold hearts ne'er heav'd With love's delirious throb, can never know My heart's first love by that ancient tree. Fair as the Ught of an unsunned pearl, To know was to worship that gentle girl ; And long I loved her but dared not tell How her sUghtest look made my wUd heart sweU, TiU, hid by the leaves of the mulberry tree, I heard her murmur a prayer for me. The agony of moments such as these ; Heart-choking sighs, too deep for utterance\u2014 The fond embrace so oft renew' d, the wUd Farewell \u2014 the thrilling pressure of the hand \u2014 The last long glance \u2014 and, oh ! far worse, the sense Of solitude weighing upon those hearts Thus lone, oppressive as the Siroc blast. They parted. Beautiful and bright the sky With sunset glow'd \u2014 save where yon thunder-cloud Roll'd its dark shadow on. The maiden's heart ThriU'd with a strange foreboding, as it swept So like an omen through its path of beauty, Darkening the day-god's parting smile. Years pass'd away ; and he, the wanderer, At length return'd ; but, oh ! how chang'd ! no more The balmy-breathing morn, or shadowy eve, Had influence o'er his soul ; the dear delights Of youth had lost their power to charm. O'er him The world had thrown its withering blight ; beneath The deadly shade of that aU-blasting Upas He had inhal'd the poison, which to him Would close the fount of bUss, never to ope Again. With heart sear'd, affections riven, He return'd, coldly to gaze on scenes which erst Had raised the thrill of rapture in his breast. And she, the vision of his earliest dreams, His bright and morning star of hope, with all The pure ingenuousness of early love, Clung to his bosom, but to feel how changed, Alas ! that heart which answered not to hers. She did not weep, but to her haunts return'd, And on the memory of departed bUss Liv'd for awhUe. But deep into her soul The pang of blighted love had entered. Day after day she faded. Like a wreath Of mist, or summer flower, she pasB'd away. I can see her still with her downcast eye, And a cheek that glowed like the sunset sky, When she heard my voice from the leafy bough, Echo her own with a kindred vow, And the tears of shame fell fast and free, As I kiss'd them off 'neath the dear old tree. And oft we met \u2014 I can see her now, With her hair blown back from her sunny brow, And her smile of love, so arch and sweet, When she found me first at our shady seat ; Oh ! weU may that spot be dear to me, For our trysting place was the mulberry tree. And she would come when the moonUght fell On the broad old oak in the mossy deU, CarolUng many an olden lay, BUthe as a bird on a leafy spray. I can hear her now, with her tones so free, As she sat and sung by the mulberry tree. That voice is hushed and that song is stiU, And I am alone in a world of Ul ; An old worn man, I have come to look Again, ere I die, on this shelter'd nook \u2014 Again to sit by that mulberry tree, Whose every leaf has a tale for me. Alas ! for her and that sister band, Who, with glist'ning eyes and outspread hand, Would cluster round as I shook the bough, And the ripe fruit fell \u2014 they are sUent now, For the spoiler Death hath spared but me Of all that laughed 'neath the mulberry tree. They are gone before, and I fain would follow, For the world seems cold and its smiles are hoUow ; There is not a voice whose tone I know, Nor aught to love \u2014 'tis time to go ; The past alone has a voice for me, And it speaks from that ancient mulberry tree.

Their Wilhelm, little innocent, The youngest of the seven, Was beautiful as painters paint, THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH. Under a spreading chestnut-tree The viUage smithy stands ; The smith, a mighty man is he, The cherubim of heaven. By turns he gave his hand, so dear, To parent, sister, brother, And each, that he was safe and near, With large and sinewy hands ; And the muscles of his brawny arms Are strong as iron bands. Confided in the other. His hair is crisp, and black, and long, His face is like the tan ; But WUhelm loved the field-flowers bright, With love beyond all measure ; His brow is wet with honest sweat, He earns whate'er he can, And looks the whole world in the face, And culled them with as keen deUght As misers gather treasure. For he owes not any man. Unnoticed, he contrived to gbde Adown a greenwood aUey, By UUes lured, that grew beside A streamlet in the vaUey. Week in, week out, from morn tiU night, You can hear his beUows blow ; You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, With measured beat and slow, And there, where under beech and birch, The rivulet meandered ; He strayed, tiU neither shout nor search, Could track where he had wandered. Like a sexton ringing the viUage beU, When the evening sun is low. And children coming home from school Look in at the open door ; They love to see the flaming forge, And hear the beUows roar, And catch the burning sparks that fly Like chaff from a threshing floor. Still louder, with increasing dread, They caU his darling name ; But 'twas Uke speaking to the dead\u2014 An echo only came. Hours passed, tiU evening's beetle roams, And blackbird's songs begin ; Then aU went back to happy homes, Save WUhelm's kith and kin. He goes on Sunday to the church, And sits among his boys ; He hears the parson pray and preach, He hears his daughter's voice The night came on \u2014 aU others slept Their cares away tiU morn ; But sleepless, aU night watched and wept That fanuly forlorn. Singing in the village choir ; And it makes his heart rejoice. It sounds to him like her mother's voice, Singing in paradise ! He needs must think of her once more, Betimes the town-crier had been sent With loud beU up and down ; And told th' afflicting accident Throughout Wiesbaden's town. How in the grave she Ues ; And with his hard, rough hand he wipes A tear out of his eyes. The news reached Nassau's duke\u2014 ere earth Was gladdened by the lark, ToUing, \u2014 rejoicing, \u2014 sorrowing, Onward through life he goes ; Each morning sees some task begin, He sent a hundred soldiers forth To ransack aU his park. Each evening sees it close ; Something attempted, something done, Has earned a night's repose.

He said :\u2014 Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Puff Stuff, the physician to the great and mighty Kow Kann, Emperor of aU the Chinas ; I was converted to Christianity during the embassy of the late Lord Macartney, and left that country and came to this, which may be reckoned the greatest blessing that ever happened to Europe, for I've brought with me the follow ing unparalleled, inestimable, and never-to-be-matched medicines. The first is called the Great Parry Mandyron Rapskianum, from Wandy Whang Whang\u2014 one drop of which, poured into any of your gums, if you should have the misfortune to lose your teeth, will cause a new set to sprout out like mushrooms from a hot-bed ; and if any lady should happen to be troubled with that unpleasant and redundant exuberance called a beard, it wiU remove it in three applications, and with greater ease than Packwood's razor strops. I'm also very celebrated in the cure of the eyes. The late Emperor of China had the misfortune to lose his eyes by a catarach. I very dexterously took out the eyes of his majesty, and after anointing the sockets with a particular glutinous application, I placed in two eyes from the head of a Uving lion, which not only restored his majesty's vision, but ma'le him dreadful to aU his enemies and beholders. I beg leave to say, that I have eyes from different animals, and to suit all your different faces and professions. This bottle which I hold in my hand is caUed the grand elhptical, asiatical, panticurial, nervous cordial, which cures all diseases incidental to humanity. I don't Uke to talk of myself, ladies and gentlemen, because the man who talks of himself is an egotist, but this I wiU venture to say of myself, that I am not only the greatest physician and phUosopher of the age, but the greatest genius that ever iUuminated mankind ; \u2014 but you know I don't like to talk of myself, you should only read one or two of my Usts of cures, out of the many thou sands I have by me.

Each for himself must do his Master's worlr, Or at his peril leave it all undone ; Witness the fate of one who sought to shirk The sanctuary's service, yet would shun The penalty. A man of earthly aims (So runs the apologue), whose pious spouse Would oft remind him of the church's claims, Still answered thus : \"Go thou and pay our vows For thee and me!\" Now, when at Peter's gate The twain together had arrived at last, He let the woman in ; then to her mate, Shutting the door, \" Thou hast already passed By proxy,\" said the saint \u2014 \"just in the way That thou on earth wast wont to fast and pray.\" The parson roared, surprised to find A foe so desperate close behind ; On Madge, on Hodge, he cried for aid, But both were deaf to all he said. The scene a numerous circle draws, Who haUed the sow with loud applause ; Well pleased they saw his reverence writhe, And swore 'twas fairly tithe for tithe. \" Tithe.! \" says the parson, \" tithe, d'ye say ? By gad ! here's one half rent away ! \" His case, 'tis true, was most forlorn, His coat, his wig, nay, breech were torn ; And, what the mildest priest might ruffle, He lost the pig amidst the scuffle. \" Now give me which you please \" he cried ; \" Nay, pick and choose,\" Hodge stiU repHed : \" Choose ! honest friend, alas ! but how ? Heaven shield me from your murdering sow ! When tithes invite, in spite of foes, THE TITHE PIG. Not far from London lived a boor, Who fed three dozen pigs or more ; Alike removed from care and strife, Hodge crack'd his joke, and loved his wife : Madge, too, Uke most wives, fond of sway, Was pleased whene'er she had her way : Though some may think I deal in fiction, She seldom met with contradiction ; Yet, stubborn as the pigs she fed, She neither would be driven nor led ; And worthy Hodge so wise would seem He never row'd against the stream. And there, subdued by nature's law, Young pigs were always in the straw : Each week, as genial fate decreed, Produced a new and numerous breed ; Whene'er they came, sedate and kind, The vicar was not far behind. I dare take Satan by the nose ! Through any storms or perils venture, But who that dreadful sty would enter ? Yet, whUe there's hope the prize to win, By gad ! to leave it is a sin.\" And then he arm'd his breast with rage, And half resolved the sow t' engage. Spite of the parson's angry mood, The fearless sow collected stood, And seemed to wage the proffered war, With, \" touch them, scoundrel, if you dare ! \" His last resource the parson tried, Hem'd, stroked his chin, and gravely cried :\u2014 \" Ye swains, protect your injured priest \u2014 Secure the pig, and share the feast.\" Staunch to his friend was every swain, Strange tho' it seems, the bribe was vain ; And Hodge, who heard them each refuse, Exclaim'd in triumph, \" Pick and choose ! \" The parson's heart grew warm with ire, But pride forbade him to retire ; What numbers can his spleen declare, y$N once denied his favourite fare ?

Of pigs so prime their worth he knew, And, parson-like, would have his due. He watched the hour with anxious ken, His heart grew warm at number ten : The younger pigs to him were sweeter, And scarce aUow'd them time to Utter. One morn, with smile and bow polite, He claim'd from Hodge his 'custom'd right ; But first inquired in accents mUd, \" How fared his wife and darling child ? How apples, pears, and turnips grew, And whether the ale was old or new ? \" Hodge, who from custom took the hint, Knew it was wrong a priest to stint ; So while his reverence took his swig, /\"v He etept aside and fetched the pig.

Toll for the brave ! King Bruce of Scotland flung himself down In a lonely mood to think ; 'Tis true he was monarch, and wore a crown, The brave that are no more ! AU sunk beneath the wave, Fast by their native shore ! But his heart was beginning to sink. For he had been trying to do a great deed To make his people glad ; He had tried and tried, but couldn't succeed : Eight hundred of the brave, Whose courage well was tried, Had made the vessel reel, And laid her on her side. And so he became quite sad. He flung himself down in low despair, As grieved as man could Ue ; A land breeze shook the shrouds, And she was overset : And after a while, as he ponder'd there, \" I'll give it aU up,\" said he. Down went the Royal George, With aU her crew complete Now just at the moment a spider dropp'd, With its silken cobweb clue ; Toll for the brave ! Brave Kempenfelt is gone : His last sea-fight is fought ; And the king in the midst of his thinking stopp'd To see what the spider would do. His work of glory done. 'Twas a long way up to the ceiling dome, And it hung by a rope so fine ; It was not in the battle ; No tempest gave the shock ; That how it would get to its cobweb home, King Bruce could not divine. She sprang no fatal leak ; She ran upon no rock. It soon began to cling and crawl Straight up with strong endeavour ; But down it came with a slippery sprawl, His sword was in its sheath ; His fingers held the pen, When Kempenfelt went down With twice four hundred men. As near to the ground as ever. Weigh the vessel up, Once dreaded by our foes ! Up, up it ran, not a second it stayed, To utter the least complaint ; Till it fell still lower, aud there it laid, And mingle with our cup The tear that England owes. A little dizzy and faint. Its head grew steady \u2014 again it went, And travell'd a half-yard higher ; 'Twas a delicate thread it had to tread, Her timbers yet are sound, And she may float again FuU charged with England's thunder And plough the distant main. And a road where its feet would tire. Again it fell and swung below, But again it quickly mounted ; But Kempenfelt is gone, His victories are o'er; Till up and down, now fast, now slow, Nine brave attempts were counted. And he and his eight hundred Shall plough the waves no more. \" Sure,\" cried the king, \"that foolish thing WiU strive no more to climb ; THE MODERN PATRIOT. When it toils so hard to reach and cUng, And tumbles every time.\" Rebellion is my theme aU day ; I only wish 'twould come (As who knows but perhaps it may ?) A Uttle nearer home. But up the insect went once more, Ah ! me, tis an anxious minute ; He's only a foot from his cobweb door, Oh ! say, wUl he lose or win it ! Yon roaring boys, who rave and fight On t'other side the Atlautic, I always held them in the right, But most so when most frantic. Steadily, steadily, inch by inch, Higher and higher he got ; And a bold little run at the very last pinch, Put him into his native cot. When lawless mobs insult the court, That man shall be my toast, If breaking windows be the sport, Who bravely breaks the most. \" Bravo ! bravo ! \" the king cried out, \" All honour to those who try : The spider up there defied despair ; He conquered, and why shouldn't I ? \" But oh ! for him my fancy culls The choicest flowers she bears, Who constitutionally pulls Your house about your ears. And Bruce of Scotland braced his mind, And gossips teU the tale, That he tried once more as he tried before And that time did not fail. Pay goodly heed, all ye who read, And beware of saying \" I can't.\" 'Tis a cowardly word, and apt to lead To idleness, foUy, and want. Such civil broUs are my deUght, Though some folks can't endure them, Who say the mob are mad outright, And that a rope must cure them. Whenever you find your heart despair Of doing some goodly thing ; Gon over this strain, try bravely again, And remember the spider and king ! A rope !

Now, very sensibly indeed, Miss Grist Au unassuming body, and in truth A lad of decent parts and good repute ; Thought opportunity should not be miss'd ; Knowing that prudery oft lets slip a joy ; Thus was Miss Grist too prudent to be coy. This youth had sense and spirit, Yet with all his sense Excessive diffidence For really 'tis with girls a dangerous farce, To flout a swain when offers are but scarce. Obscured his merit. One day at table, flush'd with pride and wine, His honour proudly free, severely merry, She did not scream, and cry, \" I'll not be woo'd ; Keep off, you smutty fellow\u2014 don't be rude ; I'm meet for your superiors, tinker.\" \u2014 No, Conceived it would be vastly fine, To crack a joke upon his secretary. \" Young man,\" said he, \" by what art, craft, or trade, \" Did your good father earn his livelihood ?\" \" He was a saddler, sir,\" Modestus said, Indeed, she treated not the tinker so. But lo ! the damsel with her usual squint, Suffered her tinker lover to imprint Sweet kisses on he* lips, and squeeze her hand, Hug her, and say the softest things unto her, And in love's plain and pretty language woo her, \" And in his line was reckon'd good.\" \" A saddler, eh ! and taught you Greek, ' Instead of teaching you to sew ; And pray, sir, why didn't your father make A saddler, sir, of you ?\" Each parasite, as he in duty bound, The joke applauded, and the laugh went round. At length, Modestus, bowing low, Without a frown, or even a reprimand. Soon won, the nymph agreed to join his bed, And, when the tinker choose, to church be led. Now, to the father the brisk lover hied, Who at his noisy mill so busy plied, Grinding, and taking handsome toll of corn, Sometimes, indeed, too handsome to be borne . \" Ho ! Master Miller,\" did the tinker say,\u2014 Forth from his cloud of flour the miller came ; \" Nice weather, Master Miller \u2014 charming day \u2014 Heaven's very kind.\" \u2014 The miller said the same. Said, craving pardon if too free he made, \" Sir, by your leave, I fain would know Your father's trade.\" \" My father's trade ! why, sir, that is too bad, My father's trade ! why, blockhead, art thou mad ?

Before you here a venturous woman bends ! A warrior woman that in strife embarks, The first of all dramatic Joan of Arcs. Cheer on the enterprise thus dared by me ! The first that ever led a company ! What though, until this very hour and age, A lessee lady never own'd a stage. I'm that Belle Sauvage \u2014 only rather quieter \u2014 Like Mrs. Nelson, turn'd a stage proprietor ! Welcome each early and each late arriver ; This is my omnibus, and I'm the driver. Sure is my venture, for all honest folk, Who love a tune, or can enjoy a joke, Will know, whene'er they have an hour of leisure, Wych Street is best to come to for their pleasure ; The laughter and the lamps with equal share, ShaU make this house a light house against care. This is our home ! 'Tis yours as well as mine ; Here joy may pay her homage at Mirth's shrine ! Song, whim, and fancy, jocund round shall dance, And lure for you the light vaudeviUe from France. Humour and wit encourage my intent ; And music means to help me pay my rent. 'Tis not mere promise \u2014 I appeal to facts, Henceforward judge me by my acts ! In this my purpose, stand I not alone, AU women wish for houses of their own ! And I was weary of perpetual dodging From house to house, in search of board and lodging ! Faint was my heart \u2014 but with Pandora's scope, I find in every box a lurking hope. My dancing spirits know of no decline, Here's the first tier you've ever seen of mine. Oh, my kind friends ! befriend me stiU, as you Have in my bygone times been wont to do. Make me your ward, against each ill designer, And prove Lord Chancellors, to a female minor. Cheer on my comrades, too, in their career \u2014 Some of your favourites are around me here ; Give them \u2014 give me \u2014 the smUes of approbation , StUl aid the petticoat on old kind principles, And make me yet, a Captain of Invincibles. I du believe in special ways 0' praying an' convartin' ; The bread comes back in many days, An' buttered, tu, fer sartin ; \u2014 I mean in preyin' till one busts On wut the party chooses, An' in convartin' public trusts To very privit uses. I du believe hard coin the stuff Per 'lectioneers to spout on ; The people's oilers soft enough To make hard money out on ; Dear Uncle Sam pervides fer his, An' gives a good-sized junk to all, \u2014 I don't care how hard money is, Ez long ez mine's paid punctooal. I du believe with all my soul In the gret Press's freedom, To pint the people to the goal An' in the traces lead 'em ; Palsied the arm thet forges yokes At my fat contracts squintin', An' withered be the nose thet pokes Inter the gov'ment printin' ! I du believe thet I should give Wut's his'n unto C\u00e6sar, Fer it's by him I move an' Uve, From him my bread an' cheese air ; I du believe thet all o' me Doth bear his souperscription, \u2014 Will, conscience, honour, honesty, An' things o' thet description. I du beUeve in prayer an' praise To him thet hez the grantin' 0' jobs, \u2014 in every thin' thet pays, But most of all in Cantin' ; This doth my cup with marcies fiU, This lays all thought o' sin to rest, \u2014 I don't believe in princerple, But, O, I du in interest."], [107, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 89 No. THE CASTAWAY. THE DEATH OF MANFRED. Obscurest night involved the sky, The Atlantic billows roar'd, Man. The stars are forth, the moon above the tops Of the snow-shining mountains. \u2014 Beautiful ! I linger yet with nature for the night Hath been to me a more familiar face Than that of man ; and in her starry shade Of dim and solitary loveliness, I learn'd the language of another world. I do remember me, that in my youth, When I was wandering, \u2014 upon such a night I stood within the Coliseum's wall, Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome ; The trees which grew along the broken arches Waved dark in the blue midnight, and the stars Shone through the rents of ruin ; from afar The watch-dog bay'd beyond the Tiber ; and More near from out the C\u00e6sars' palace came The owl's long cry, and, interruptedly, Of distant sentinels the fitful song Began and died upon the gentle wind. Some cypresses beyond the time-worn breach Appear'd to skirt the horizon, yet they stood Within a bowshot. Where the C\u00e6sars dwelt, And dweU the tuneless birds of night, amidst A grove which springs through levell'd battlements, And twines its roots with the imperial hearths, When such a destined wretch as I, Wash'd headlong from on board, Of friends, of hope, of aU bereft, His floating home for ever left. No braver chief could Albion boast, Than he with whom he went, Nor ever ship left Albion's coast With warmer wishes sent. He loved them both, but both in vaiu, Nor him beheld, nor her again. \u2022 Not long beneath the whelming brine Expert to swim, he lay ; Nor soon he felt his strength decUne, \"Or courage die away : But waged with death a lasting strife, Supported by despair of life. He shouted; nor his friends had fail'd To check the vessel's course, But so the furious blast prevail' d, That, pitiless perforce, They left their outcast mate behind, And scudded still before the wind. Ivy usurps the laurel's place of growth ; But the gladiator's bloody circle stands, A noble wreck in ruinous perfection, Some succour yet they could afford ; And such as storms allow, While C\u00e6sar's chambers and the Augustan halls, Grovel on earth in indistinct decay. \u2014 The cask, the coop, the floated cord, Delayed not to bestow : But he, they knew, nor ship nor shore, Whate'er they gave, should visit move. And thou didst shine, thou rolling moon, upon All this, and cast a wide and tender light, Which soften'd down the hoar austerity Of rugged desolation, and fiU'd up, As 't were anew, the gaps of centuries ; Leaving that beautiful which still was so, And making that which was not, till tho place Became reUgion, and the heart ran o'er With silent worship of the great of old, \u2014 The dead but sceptred sovereigns, who stUl n;'\u00ab Our spirits from their urns. Nor, cruel as it seem'd, could ho Their haste himself condemn, Aware that flight, in such a sea, Alone could rescue them ; Yet bitter felt it stiU to die Deserted, and his friends so nigh. He long survives, who lives an hour In ocean, self-upheld : 'Twas such a night! 'Tis strange that I recall it at this time, But I have found our thoughts take wildest flight Even at the moment when they should array Themselves in pensive order. % And so long he, with unspent power, His destiny repels d : And ever, as the minutes flew, Entreated help, or cried \u2014 \" Adieu ! \" Enter the Abbot.

The clouds arose in a giant shape, And the wind with a piercing gust \u2014 Dark as a murderer's mask of crape, And sharp as a poniard-thrust. Thicker and wider the gloom stretch'd out, With a flush of angry red ; Till the hissing lightning blazed about, And the forest bent its head. * A maiden look'd from a lattice-pane Toward where the ocean lay ; And her gaze was fix'd with earnest strain On the beacon, leagues away. She knew that he who had won her soul Was getting close to land ; And she clutch'd at every thunder roll With a hard convulsive hand. He had promised he would sail no more To far and fearful climes ; He had talk'd of a cottage on the shore, And the sound of wedding chimes. They had loved each other many a year, They had grown up side by side ; She had reckon'd the days\u2014 his ship must be near- He was coming to claim his bride. An old crone pass'd the lattice-pane, \u2014 \" God help us all ! \" quoth she ; \" 'Tis bad on the mountain, but worse on the main, \u2014 'Tis a wild night at sea ! \" The maiden heard, but never stirr'd Her gaze from the beacon lamp ; Her heart alone felt a sepulchre-stone Roll up to it, heavy and dapp. A gray-hair'd mariner look'd around, \u2014 \" Here's a wind,\" cried he : \" May God preserve the homeward bound-\u2014 'Tis a wild night at sea ! \" The maiden heard, yet never stirr'd Her eyes from the distant part ; But shadow was thrown upon the stone, And the stone was over her heart. The lightning blades fenced fierce and long ; The blast wings madly flew ; But morning came, with the skylark's song, And an arch of spotless blue. Morning came with a tale too true, As sad as tale could be : A \" homeward bound \" went down with her crew, \u2014 \" 'Twas a wild night at sea ! \" The maiden heard, yet never stirr'd, Nor eye, nor lip, nor brow ; But moss had grown on the sepulchre-stone, And it cover'd a skeleton now. Summer and winter came and went, With their frosty and flowery time ! Autumn branches lusciously bent, And spring buds had thfeir prime. The maiden still is in her home ; But not a word breathes she ; Save those that seal'd her spirit doom, \u2014 \" 'Tis a wild night at sea ! \" The hedgerow thorn is out again, And her cheek is as pale as the bloom ; She bears a wound whose bleeding pain Can only be stanched by the tomb. Children show her the violet bed, And where young doves will be ; But they hear her say, as she boweth her head, \u2014 \" 'Tis a wild night at sea ! \" She may be seen at the lattice-pane When the climbing moon is bright ; With the gaze distraught of a dreaming brain Toward the beacon height. There's not a cloud a star to shroud, The song-birds haunt the tree; But she faintly~__ghs, as the dewdrops rise, \u2014 \" 'Tis a wild night at sea ! \" Golden beams of a sunny June The world with light are filling ; Till the roses fall asleep at noon O'er the draught of their own distilling : The maiden walks where aspen stalks Only move with the moth and the bee ; But she sigheth still, with shivering chill, \" 'Tis a wild night at sea ! \" Her beautiful youth has withered away j Sorrow has eaten the core ; But, weak and wan, she lingereth on Till the thorn is white once more. There are bridal robes at the old church porch, And orange-bloom so fair ; The merry bells say, 'tis a wedding-day, And the priest has bless'd the pair. The maiden is under the churchyard yew, Watching with hollow eye ; Till the merry bells race with faster pace, And the bridal robes go by. She dances out to the ding-dong tune, She laughs with raving glee ; And Death endeth the dream in her requiem scream\u2014 \" 'Tis a wild night at sea ! \" RICHMOND ENCOURAGING HIS SOLDIERS.

Should I have answered Caius Cassius so ? When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous, To lock such rascal counters from his friends, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts, Cas. Chastisement ! Dash him to pieces ! Cas. I denied you not. Bru. You did. Bru. Remember March, the ides of March remember Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake ?

And sell the mighty space of our large honours, For so mueh'trash, as may be grasp'd thus ? \u2014 I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon, That brought my answer back. \u2014 Brutus hath riv'd my heart : A friend should bear his friend's infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

Though the breath of these flowers is sweet to me, I will give them all back again.\" He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes, He kissed their drooping leaves ; With rainbow wreaths the holy stream adorning And duly the adoring moon at night Sheds her white glory there, And in the watery air Suspends her halo crowns of silver Ught. A mountain valley in its blessed breast, Receives the stream which there delights to lie, It was for the Lord of Paradise He bound them in his sheaves. Untroubled and at rest, \"_My lord has need of those flowerets gay,\" The reaper said, and smiled ; \" Dear tokens of the earth are they, Beneath the untainted sky. There in a lovely lake it seems to sleep, And thence through many a channel dark and deep, Their secret way the holy waters wind, Till rising underneath the root Of the tree of life on Hemakoot, Where he was once a child. \" They shall all bloom in fields of light, Transplanted by my care ; And saints upon their garments white, These sacred blossoms wear.\" Majestic forth they flow to purify mankind."], [112, "\u25a034 -i THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER.

Old Tubal Cain was a man of might In the days when earth was young ; By the fierce red light of his furnace bright The strokes of his hammer rung ; And he lifted high his brawny hand On the iron glowing clear, Sweet Poll ! his doting mistress cries, Sweet Poll ! the mimic bird replies, And caUs aloud for sack. She next instructs him in the kiss ; \"sis now a little one, like miss, And now a hearty smack. Till the sparks rush'd out in scarlet showers, As he fashioned the sword and spear. And he sang, \" Hurrah ! for my handiwork, Hurrah ! for the spear and sword ; Hurrah ! for the hand that shall wield them weU, For he shaU be king and lord.\" At first he aims at what he hears ; Aud, listening close with both his ears, Just catches at the sound ; But soon articulates aloud, Much to the amusement of the crowd, To Tubal Cain came many a one As he wrought by his roaring fire, And each one prayed for a strong steel blade As the crown of his desire ; And he made them weapons sharp and strong, Till they shouted loud for glee, And stuns the neighbours round. A querulous old woman's voice His humorous talent next employs ; He scolds, and gives the Ue. And now he sings, and now is sick, Here, SaUy, Susan, come, come quick, Poor Poll is Uke to die !

Well, it does sound dreadful pretty, tho', don't it ? says I ; and yet, if Latin is love and love is Latin, you hadn't no occasion, \u2014 and I got up and slipt my hand into her's \u2014 you hadn't no occasion to go to the combined school to larn it ; for natur', says I, teaches that a and I was whispeviu' of the rest o' the sentence in her ear, when her mother said, \u2014 Come, come, Mr. Slick, what' s that you are a saying of ?

That did renew old JEson. Then Shakspeare charms with wondrous magic spell, And MUton makes my mind on grandeur dwell ; Byron excites my bosom's inmost core, And conjures up ecstatic hours of yore. Campbell and Scott their inspiration lend, And love and martial spirit sweetly blend ; Shelley and Bums, Moore, Southey ,'Coleridge, White, Come to my varied thoughts aU beaming bright ; And Pope and Thomson, Goldsmith, Cowper, Gray, Yield rapturous moments for reflection's ray ; Then Bloomfield, Wordsworth, Warton, Coffins, Keats, Shed o'er my soul the influence of their sweets ! These are the spirits which my own doth choose, Whereon to ponder, meditate, and muse ; These are the men whose splendid thoughts impart Unbounded wealth, and thriU my very heart : And oh ! I feel surpassing pleasure when I hold communion with immortal men ; Repeat their thoughts with reverential tone, And let their god-like feeUngs rule my own ! Lor. In such a night, Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew, And with an unthrift love did run from Venice, As far as Belmont. Jes. And in such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well ; Stealing her soul with many vows of faith, And ne'er a true one. Lor. And in such a night Did pretty Jessica, Uke a Uttle shrew, Slander her love, and he forgave it her. Jes. I would out-night you, did nobody come ; But, hark, I hear the footing of a man. Lor. How sweet the moonUght sleeps upon this bank! Here wiU we sit, and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears ; soft stiUness, and the night, Become the touches of sweet harmony.

In meditative mood divinely grand, Man feels his very heart and soul expand ; At length, bequeathing products of his mind, A lasting benefit to all mankind. But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it. (Enter Musicians.) Come, ho, and wake Diana with a hymn ; With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear, And draw her home with music. Jes. I am never merry when I hear sweet music. [Music Lor.

When life is fair, and nothing wiU annoy ; Divine enchantress of the quiet hour, Let me inherit thy benignant power ; For even I, who am not deep in lore, May let my mind in meditation soar ; Give to my thoughts the freedom they desire, And let them wander higher stUl, and higher.

As we can ? Oft I have thought, as on the sky I gazed, With its huge arch of blue so high upraised, 'Tis a fitting hour to reckon Not only yeUow store ; How sweet to wander there ! From star to star to take my joyous way, Drink from the streams of youth, and while I stray, For passing old years beckon Where no' wealth can win the shore : 'Tis a day for age and youth To sum up their debts of truth To God and man ! The sphere's soft music hear : To commune with the spirits that abide Near to the crystal river's verdant side, Where flowerets breathe their sighs ; To gaze on scenes so bright, so passing fair, While suns pour forth perpetual radiance there, The glossy branches twining In beauty o'er your head ; They are but garlands shining In a pomp that greets the dead. And a trace of holy gloom Makes a temple of the room Where they are seen ! And pleasure never dies. Oh ! I have longed for wings to soar above The path in which the circling planets move In swift aerial dance ; Let the feasting and the drinking Be as goodly as it may ; Yet the wise ones wUl be thinking\u2014 To gaze on worlds man never yet hath seen \u2014 To tread where yet no mortal foot hath been, And onward stiU advance. As they haU the festal day \u2014 Time is hushing us to rest, As he rocks us on his breast Of Christmas green! \" Vain, vain delusive hope,\" my spirit cried ; And then methought a gentle voice repUed \u2014 \" Cling not too fondly here, And glad from earth to yonder beauteous skies When time is o'er, thy spirit shaU arise \u2014 Year after year is going, So work while there is Ught ; Let us keep the rust from growing, Let us wear our spirit bright. Akd 'tis only honest labour, Heaven's hoUer, happier sphere. \" Learn in the morning hour of youth to know Thy God, from whom thy richest blessings flow \u2014 To Him thy homage pay ; Give Him thy heart \u2014 thy first affections give \u2014 And in the world of Ught thy soul shall live When earth has passed away.\" Thus spake a voice unseen \u2014 I stood alone \u2014 Yet still I heard that sweet, that gentle tone, And the love of friend and neighbour, Can do this ! So, whUe old time is mowing Another swarthe of life, Let us pledge the cup that's flowing, To the heart that shuts out strife : For, amid all selfish blindness, It is only peace and kindness Make our bliss.

THE HOLLY TREE. Oh ! reader, hast thou ever stood to see Tho hoUy tree ? The eye that contemplates it well perceives Its glossy leaves Order'd by an intelligence so wise, As might confound the atheist's sophistries. Then gladly we haU thee\u2014 secure of thy truth, The playmate of childhood \u2014 companion of yont.h ; Let holly and ivy be wreathed round the hall, Again it shaU echo our gay Christmas caU : Hang the mistletoe up !\u2014 old excuse for the kiss Proud beauties wiU grant at a meeting like this. Below, a circUng fence, its leaves are seen Wrinkled and keen ; No grazing cattle through their prickly round Can reach to wound ; But as they grow where nothing is to fear, Smooth and unarm'd the pointless^ leaves appear. THE SNOW-STORM. Brave Winter and I shaU ever agree, Though a stern and frowning gaffer is ho : I Uke to hear him, with haU and rain, Come tapping against the window pane : I Uke to see him come marching forth, Begirt with the icicle gems of the north ; But I like him best when he comes bedight In his velvet robes of stainless white. I love to view these things with curious eyes, And moraUse : And in this wisdom of the hoUy tree Can emblems see Wherewith perchance to make a pleasant rhyme, One which may profit in the after time. Thus, though abroad perchance I might appear Harsh and austere, A cheer for the snow \u2014 the drifting snow \u2014 Smoother and purer than Beauty's brow ; The creature of thought scarce likes to tread On the delicate carpet so richly spread. With feathery wreaths the forest is bound, And the hills are ivith glittering diadems crown'd ; 'Tis the fairest scene we can have below \u2014 Sing, welcome, then, to the drifting snow. To those who on my leisure would intrude Reserved and rude, Gentle at home amid my friends I'd be, Like the high leaves upon the hoUy tree. And should my youth, as youth is apt I know, Some harshness show, AU vain asperities I day by day Would wear away, The urchins gaze with eloquent eye To see the flakes go dancing by ; In the thick of the storm how happy are they To welcome the first deep snowy day. Shouting and pelting, what bUss to faU Half-smothered beneath the weU-aim'd baU : Men of fourscore, did ye ever know TiU the smooth temper of my age should he Like the high leaves upon the holly tree. And as when aU the summer trees are seen So bright and green, The hoUy leaves a sober hue display, Less bright than they, Such sport as ye had in the drifting snow ? But when the bare and wintry woods we see, What then so cheerful as the hoUy tree ? I'm true to my theme, for I loved it well, When the gossiping nurse would sit and tell The tale of the geese, though hardly believed, I doubted and question'd the words that deceived. I rejoice in it stiU, and love to see So serious should my youth appear among The thoughtless throng, So would I seem amid the young and gay More grave than they, That in my age as cheerful I might be As the green winter of the hoUy tree. The ermine mantle on tower and tree ; 'Tis the fairest scene we can have below, Hurrah ! then, hurrah ! for the drifting snow. CHRISTMAS. HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

Home for the holidays, here we go ; But this fast train is really exceedingly slow ! Old Christmas ! brave Christmas ! again thou art near, Gladdening our homes with thy heart-stirring cheer, And bidding the cares of this work-a-day world Depart when thy banner of peace is unfurled : No guest is so constant \u2014 no friend is so true \u2014 As thou, with thy song \u2014 stiU the same, yet stUl new. We welcomed thee warmly in childhood's gay hour, Ere we dreamt how unending and great was thy power ; We thought of thee only as bringer of fun, Of mince-pies and puddings, and gists to be won ! When the dance in the hall, and the dearly-loved friends, For long weary school-days made ample amends. We held thee stUl dearer when chUdhood went by, And youth spread a glory-cloud over the sky \u2014 When love, with his bright smUe and low whispered words, Played fairy-Uke music on magical chords : When thy mistletoe tempted some faint-hearted youth To give 'neath its branches tho first kiss of truth.

Sir P.\u2014 Had you any of those Uttle elegant expenses when you married me ? Lady T. \u2014 Very true, indeed ; and after having married you, I should never pretend to taste again. Sir P. \u2014 Very weU, very well, madam : you have entirely forgot what your situation was when I first saw you. And we'll go and see Harlequin's wonderful feats, Changing by magic whatever he meets ; And Columbine, too, with her beautiful tripping ; And Clown, with his tumbUng and jumping and slipping ; Cramming aU things in his pocket so big, And letting off crackers in Pantaloon's wig.

When I came to your father's, I found you sitting at your tambour, in a Unen gown, a bunch of keys at your side, and your hair combed smoothly over a roll. Lady T. \u2014 Yes, I remember very weU : my daUy occu pations were to overlook the dairy, superintend the poultry, make extracts from the family receipt-book, and comb my aunt Deborah's lap dog. Sir P. \u2014 Oh ! I am glad to find you have so good a recoUection. Lady T. \u2014 My evening's employments were to draw patterns for ruffles, which I had not materials to make up ; play at Pope Joan with the curate ; read a sermon to my aunt Deborah ; or perhaps be stuck up at an old spinnet, to thrum my father to sleep after a fox-chase. Sir P. \u2014 Then you were glad to take a ride out behind the butler, upon the old docked coach-horse. Lady T. \u2014 No, no ; I deny the butler and the coach horse. Sir P. \u2014 I say you did ! This was your situation. Now, madam, you must have your coach vis-d-vis, and three powdered footmen to walk before your chair ; and in summer, two white cats to draw you to Kensington Gardens ; and, instead of your Uving in that hole in the country, I have brought you home here, made a woman of fortune of you, a woman of quaUty \u2014 in short, I have made you my wife. stands ; They see us, they see us, they're waving their hands ; Why don't the train stop, what are they about ?

But now we have finished our morning conversation, I presume I may go to my engagement at Lady Sneerwell's ? Sir Peter.\u2014 Lady Teazle, Lady Teazle, I won't bear it. L.

Sir P. \u2014 What ! madam ; is there no respect due to the authority of a husband ? Sir P. \u2014 Lady Sneerwell !\u2014 a precious acquaintance you have made of her, too, and the set that frequent her house ! Such a set \u2014 mercy on us !

Lady T. \u2014 Why, don't I know that no woman of fashion does as she's bid after her marriage ? Though I was bred in the country, I'm no stranger to that. If you wanted me to be obedient you should have adopted me, and not married me \u2014 I'm sure you were old enough. Sir P. \u2014 Ay, there it is. Madam, what right have you to run into all this extravagance ? Lady T. \u2014 I'm sure I'm not more extravagant than a woman of quaUty ought to be. Lady T. \u2014 How can you be so severe ? I am sure they are aU people of fashion, and very tenacious of reputation. Sir P. \u2014 Yes ; so tenacious of it, they'U not aUow it to any but themselves.

He took his lute, whose magic tone Had oft his soul beguiled, When, in that guarded chamber, lone, He heard its breathings wUd. He touched it, and the trembling chords With sUver music rung, Then to the minstrel maid, in words The crested fountains gently play, Cooling the sultry air, And flowers, that shun the garish day, Of answering sadness, sung. \" The soldier from the battle plain Returned with glory crown'd, Fling richest fragrance there.

He is a puzzle to the servants, who are fearful of being too obsequious, or not civil enough to him. The guests think \"they have seen him before.\" Every one speculated upon his condition ; and the most part take him to be a tide-waiter. He calleth you by your Christian name, to imply that his other is the same with your own. He is too familiar by half, yet you wish he had less diffidence. With half the famUiarity, he might pass for a casual dependant ; with more boldness, he would be in no danger of being taken for what he is. He is too humble tor a friend, yet taketh oh him more state than befits a client. He is a worse guest than a country tenant, inas- much as he bringeth up no rent ; yet 'tis odds, from his garb and demeanour, that your guests take him for one. He is asked to make one at the whist-table ; refuseth on the score of poverty, and resents being left out. When the company break up he proffereth to go for a coach, and lets the servant go. He recollects your grandfather ; and will thrust in some mean and quite unimportant anecdote of the family. He knew it when it was not quite so flourishing as he is blest in seeing it now. He reviveth past situations, to institute what he calls favourable comparisons. With a reflecting sort of congratulation he wiU inquire the price of your furniture ; and insults you with a special commendation of your window-curtains. He is of opinion that the urn is the more elegant shape; but, after all, there was some- thing more comfortable about the old tea-kettle, which you must remember. He dare say you must find a great con venience in having a carriage of your own, and appealeth to your lady if it is not so. Inquireth if you have had your arms done on vellum yet; and did not know till lately that such and such had been the crest of the famUy. His memory is unseasonable, his compliments perverse, his talk a trouble, his stay pertinacious; and when ho goeth away you dismiss his chair into a corner as precipi tately as possible, and feel fairly rid of two nuisances.

The lute went round, and the jest ran high, And the wine cups passed along, But the monarch only heard the sigh She breathed as he raised the song. And his spirit drank from the fount of love, As he gazed on that maiden's eyes \u2014 Bright as the stars that in beauty above Shine in the nightly skies. In Stirling's courts is heard the strain Of rapturous joy, as once again Her monarch treads the halls of state, Where crowds of noble warriors wait. And who is she with downcast eye, That blushes as she passes by ? 'Tis Beaufort's daughter, Scotland's queen, The mistress of that brUUant scene. The king to his own loved highland home, To his ancient father-land, From the Southron's royal court has come, With a proud and gallant band ; And has placed the crown on the fair white brow Of the lovely minstrel maid, Who oft, 'neath evening's purple glow, To the captive king had play'd. THE FATE OF DOCTOR MARSHALL. Not a sou had he got \u2014 not a guinea or note, And he look'd confoundedly flurried, As he bolted away without paying his shot, And the landlady after him hurried. We saw him again at dead of night, When home from the club returning ; We twigg'd the Doctor beneath the light Of the gas-lamp brUUantly burning. All bare, and exposed to the midnight dews, Reclined in the gutter we found him ; And he looked like a gentleman taking a snooze, With his Marshall cloak around him. \" The Doctor's as drunk as the d ,\" we said, And we managed a shutter to borrow ; We rais'd him, and sigh'd at the thought that his head Would \"eonsumedly ache \" on the morrow. We bore him home, and we put him to bed, And we told his wife and his daughter To give him, next morning, a couple of red POOR RELATIONS. A poor relation is the most irrelevant thing in nature, j a piece of impertinent correspondency, an odious approxi- 1 mation, a haunting conscience, a preposterous shadow, i lengthening in the noontide of your prosperity, an un welcome remembrancer, a perpetually recurring mortifica tion, a drain on your purse, a more intolerable dun upon your pride, a drawback upon success, a rebuke to your rising, a stain in your blood, a blot on your scutcheon, a rent in your garment, a death's-head at your banquet. Agathocles's pot, a Mordecai in your gate, a Lazarus at your door, a Uon in your path, a frog in your chamber, a fly in your ointment, a mote in your eye, a triumph to your enemy, an apology to your friends, the one thing not needful, the haU in harvest, the ounce of sour in a pound of sweet.

He entereth smiUng and em barrassed. He holdeth out his hand to you to shake, and draweth it back again. He casuaUy looketh in about dinner-time, when the table is full. He offereth to go away, seeing you have company, but is induced to stay- He filleth a chair, and your visitor's two children are accommodated at a side table. He never eometh upon days when your wife saj'S, with some complacency, \" My dear, perhaps Mr. will drop in to-day.\" He remem bereth birthdays, and professeth he is fortunate to have stumbled upon one. He declareth against fish, tho turbot being small, yet suffereth himself to be importuned into a sUce against his first resolution. He sticketh by the port, yet will be prevailed upon to empty tho remaining glass Herrings, with soda water.

To cure this iU, he thought it right Some admonition to indite, Which, from the pulpit he might lance, Against this horrid sin's advance. Now John himself loved whisky toddy As weU as any other body ; So prudence told him to beware, And use his censure with great care ; Lest, while another's fault were shown, He indirectly whipp'd his own. Depend upon't, at last ye'U rue, Woe to the man in youthful prime, That wastes his siUer thus and time ; He'U sair repent and wail the day, When time has turned his locks to grav. So tak na mair 0' drink or food, Than what wiU do the body good : Thus thoughts he turned with greatest care, Himself more than his flock to spare. John, every fear and danger scorning, Spoke boldly thus one Sunday morning : \" My dearest brethren, I would fain Save ye and my ainsel' the pain Of preaching t'ye of a sin That maist o' ve hae tumbled in, Of my advice, but mak a proof, And ye'U dee quite weel enough.\""], [123, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. - 105 Waste sandy valleys, once perplex'd with thorn, The spiry fir and shapely box adorn ; To leafless shrubs the flowery palms succeed, And odorous myrtle to the noisome weed.

Tired with the taper's sickly light, And with the wearying, number'd night, CHARACTER OF MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS. I hail the streaks of morn divine : And lo ! they break between the dewy wreaths That round my rural casement twine : The fresh gale o'er the green lawn breathes ; It fans my feveri-4h brow, \u2014 it calms the mental strife, Andcheerily re-illumes the lambent flame of Use. To all the charms of beauty, and the utmost elegance of external form, she added those accomplishments which render their impressions irresistible. Polite, affable, in sinuating, sprightly, and capable of speaking and of writing with equal ease and dignity. Sudden, however, and violent in all her attachments, because her heart was warm and unsuspicious. Impatient of contradiction, because she had been accustomed from her infancy to be treated as a queen. No stranger, on some occasions, to dissimulation, which, in that perfidious court, where she received her education, was reckoned among the necessary arts of government. Not insensible of flattery, or un conscious of that pleasure with which almost every woman beholds the influence of her own beauty. Formed with the qualities which we love, not with the talents that we admire, she was an agreeable woman, rather than an illustrious queen. The vivacity of her spirit, not sufficiently tempered with sound judgment, and the warmth of her heart, which was not at all times under the restraint of discretion, betrayed her both into errors and into crimes. To say that she was always unfortunate will not account for that long and almost uninterrupted succession of calamities which befell her ; we must like wise add that she was often imprudent. Her passion for Darnley was rash, youthful, and excessive. And, though the sudden transition to the opposite extreme was the natural effect of her Ul-requited love, and of his ingrati tude, insolence, and brutality, yet neither these nor Both weU's artful address and important services can justify her attachment to that nobleman. Even the manners of the age, licentious as they were, are no apology for this unhappy passion ; nor can they induce us to look on that tragical and infamous scene which followed upon it with less abhorrence. Humanity wiU draw a veil over this part of her character, which it cannot approve, and may, perhaps, prompt some to impute her actions to her situa tion more than to her disposition, and to lament the un happiness of the former rather than accuee the perverse ness of the latter. The lark has her gay song begun, She leaves her grassy nest, And soars tiU the unrisen sun Gleams on her speckled breast. Now let me leave my restless bed, And o'er the spangled uplands tread ; Now through the custom'd wood-walk wend! By many a green lane lies my way, Where high o'erhead the wild briars bend, Till on the mountain's summit grey, I sit me down, and mark the glorious dawn of day. Oh ! Heav'n, the soft refreshing gale It breathes into my breast ! My sunk eye gleams ; my cheek, so pale, Is with new colours drest. Blithe health ! thou soul of life and ease ! Come thou too on the balmy breeze, Invigorate my frame : I'll join with thee the buskin'd chace, With thee the distant clime will trace, Beyond those clouds of flame. Above, below, what charms unfold In all the varied view ? Before me all is burnish'd gold, Behind, the twilight's hue. The mists which on old night await, Far to the west they hold their state, They shun the clear blue face of morn ; Along the fine cerulean sky, The fleecy clouds successive fly, WhUe bright prismaticbeams their shadowy folds adorn. And hark ! the thatcher has begun His whistle on the eaves, And oft the hedger's bill is heard Mary's sufferings exceed both in degree and in duration those tragical distresses which fancy has figured to excite sorrow and commiseration ; and while we survey them, we are apt altogether to forget her frailties ; we think of her faults with less indignation, and approve of our tears as if they were shed for a person who had attained much nearer to pure virtue. Among the rustling leaves. The slow team creaks upon the road, The noisy whip resounds, The driver's voice, his carol blithe, The mower's stroke, his whetting scythe, Mix with the morning's sounds. With regard to the queen's person, a circumstance not to be omitted in writing the history of a female reign, aU contemporary authors agree in ascribing to Mary the utmost beauty of countenance and elegance of shape of which the human form is capable. Her hair was black, though, according to the fashion of that age, she frequently wore borrowed looks, and of different colours. Her eyes were a dark grey, her complexion was exquisitely fine, and her hands and arms remarkably delicate, both as to shape and colour. Her stature was of a height that rose to the majestic. She danced, she walked, and rode with equal grace. Her taste for music was just, and she both sang and played upon the lute with uncommon Bkill. Towards the end of her life she began to grow fat, and her long confinement, and the coldness of the houses in which she had been imprisoned, brought on a rheumatism which deprived her of the use of her Umbs. \" No man,\" says Brantome, \" ever beheld her person without admiration and love, or wUl read her history without sorrow.\" Who would not rather take his seat Beneath these clumps of trees, The early dawn of day to greet, And catch the healthy breeze, Than on the sUken couch of sloth Luxuriously to lie ? Who would not from life's dreary waste Snatch, when he could, with eager haste, An interval of joy ?

And hold its old renown. Nor surer round accustom'd eaves The wheeling swallow oUngs, When first the cuckoo wakes the year, And every woodland rings. Hence holds he truth as clear and good As ever fell from pen, But soon as summer scents the hay, Or autumn swells the grain, Full many a swain will think of Tom, Kare wisdom by the wayside learn'd, Ripe knowledge, not of men.

Small stock hath he at fortune's hand, As many count their store ; Yet ne'er a lord in all the land So keepeth he for each and all What best may seem relief ; Need ask his God for more. An honest hand that gets him bread, A heart that keeps content, These are his wealth \u2014 and, in their stead, In mirthful mood, good store of smiles, In sorrow, honest grief.

Oh ! what an awful spectacle to meet a father's eye !

A mote upon the sun's broad face he seemed unto my view ; But once I thought I saw him stoop, as if he would alight \u2014 \" Is they ? \" murmured his quiescent lady, who was sitting dozing over the remains of a glass of toddy. \"Yes, lovey dovey,\" resumed her eloquent husband; \"and if you will just keep awake for half-an-hour, I wiU do you the honour to state a few thoughts that occupy my wig-ridden noddle at this precise moment of time. I was just about to observe that Shakspeare was right when he made those elegant remarks ; and, moreover, that we are wrong in quietly sitting down by our own fireside, and allowing our sweetness to waste on the desert air, while hundreds more unworthy than ourselves, less endowed by nature to figure upon this world's stage, ' reap honour to themselves, and strut about as if this wide world were aU too small for their shrunk shanks.' \" Whereupon Mrs. P. nodded ; but whether this motion of her cranium was occasioned by her acquiescence in the foregoing remark, or produced by that resistless stupifying visitor which usually pays its addresses to middle-aged ladies who sit down at ten o'clock at night to inhale the fumes of their husband's tobacco, and sip np a tumbler of toddy, I will not pretend to decide ; but certain it is, that her worthy husband seemed perfectly satisfied with the interest shp 'Twas only a delusive thought, for all had vanished quite.

The immortal Shakspeare was lest for days unopened\u2014 the evening's pipe forgotten; each day was spent in can vassing the ward, with the afore-mentioned stout gentle men, and each evening was appropriated to the \" Select Committees\" who met to discuss the best means of securing his election. Great alarm was produced by the appearance of a new candidate in the field, in the person of Jeremiah Snip, Esq., tailor, etc., who was a particu larly smaU man, famed for wit and whiskers, and who pubUshed a circular, stating that it was his \"humble opinion that aU breeches should be repaired ; and as there had been a breech made in the Common Council, by the death of his dear lamented friend, Jonathan Giblet, Esq., he (Mr. Snip) would readily undertake to mend it, and hoped he should not make a very disereditable patch.\" The pubUc opinion, however, was decidedly in favour of our hero, and numberless were the congratulations of his friends and neighbours upon his presumed success; and all to a man promised him their votes at the election. Mr. P., of course, beUeved them, and requested his wife to send \" an order \" to the shops of these independent electors \" who had his interest so much at heart.\" On the evening before the auspicious day did our worthy can didate for civic honours mount upon his counting-house stool, adjust his wig, and bidding his loving spouse imagine herself an audience, solemnly and deUberately deUver himself of a Shaksperian oration, which it had taken him weeks to concoct. His wife, of course, said it was very fine ; but, at the same time, wondered what it could aU mean ; and she certainly thought her Peter \" must be very clever to say such hard words and use such gentle manlike antics.\" \" Don't I stand up like an alderman, lovey dovey ? \" said our friend, as he raised himself on tiptoe ; \" and don't I hasperate my h's Uke a gentleman ? Would you \u2014 would you now suppose I was the identical Peter Pancake who used to call out ' Hot pies ' at the corner of Jones's-aUey ? \" \" Oh ! no,\" answered his dear wife, who by this time had composed herself for a doze. '* Then ain't you proud of me ? \" resumed he ; \" and shan't I look Uke the Lord Mayor himself when I put on my mazarine gown ? \" \"How much wUl it cost?\" inquired the careful Mrs. Pancake. \"Oh! merely a trifle ; besides, I shall bargain with the robemaker to take it out in sausages. That's the way to do businsss, you know.\" \"A customer did you say, Peter ? \" suddenly ejaculated the lady. \"No, no! do you know what I have been talking about ? \" \u25a0' Yes,\" replied the half-offended Mrs. Pancake, \" you've been dinging into my ears that everlasting Shakes \u2014 aU about stages and players \u2014 I won't hear it, I won't.\" \" Nay, now, lovey dovey P., I only want to impress upon your mind the glorious visions of future eminence which have lately haunted my expansive intellect. To make a long matter short, I have made up my mind to put up for the office of common councUman, vacant by the death of our late lamented member Jonathan Giblet.\" This announcement caused the half -awakened Mrs. Pancake to open her eyes in real earnest ; and after a moment's mental musing she exclaimed, with heart- rending pathos, \" But won't it come expensive ? \" A most interesting and animating discussion here took place between this worthy pair, tho better-half showing herself to be perfectly wide awake where pounds shillings and pence were concerned. I wiU not pretend to say at what hour of the night this confabulation was terminated, but of the result I am perfectly aware ; for the very next day four stout-looking gentlemen, of the respective occu- pations of greengrocer, taUow-chandler, staymaker, and butcher, might have been seen gently tripping into every house, displaying large sheets of foolscap paper, upon which was described, in round text-hand writing, the ex- traordinary talents and endowments of Mr. Peter Pancake, \" who had condescended to yield to the earnest soUcita- tions of his feUow-parishioners to aUow his name to stand as one of the candidates for the office of Common CouncU- man.\" The four stout-looking gentlemen then proceeded to request the signatures of the \" Worthy Independent Electors,\" and vehemently assured them \"that everything that mortal could do for the furtherance of their respective pohtical opinions should be accompUshed by the energetic, the warm-hearted, the not-to-be-mistaken Mr. Peter .Pancake.\" Whereupon each of the independent electors \" felt proud to have it in their power to support such talents and virtues as those with which Mr. Pancake was endowed,\" and unhesitatingly put their names or their mark at the bottom of the text-hand requisition. Deeming himself possessed of unrivaUed talents and intellectual capabiUties, he imagined he was destined to fill some high and honourable post in society ; and as the City of London was to his limited ideas \"the world,\" and the office of Lord Mayor the highest honour that could be bestowed upon mortal man, his ambition naturaUy led him towards that goal ; and to this end he had em braced the first opportunity that occurred of introducing himself to the worthy citizens, by becoming a candidate for the office of Common CouncUman in his populous ward. The partiaUty which Mr. Pancake entertained for the plays of Shakspeare the reader has no doubt already discovered. Without comprehending the one-half of what he read, he would sit for hours learning detached sen tences from his favourite volume, and reciting them with energy and. enthusiasm to his unedified wife, who candidly acknowledged that such fine words were beyond her comprehension. This amiable couple, moreover, were blessed with a second Peter, whose partiality for picture books confirmed his father in the long-cherished idea, that this notable scion of his house would one day become a star in the Uterary world. \" To be sure,\" said his lady ; \" there's nothing like pushing the trade.\" \"I say, lovey dovey, what wiU our Peter say, when he hears of my blushing honours thick upon me ? Lor ! how we've ris in the world. Only think, Peter the first a Common Councilman, and Peter the second an M. A ! \" Mrs. Pancake was just going to inquire the meaning of M.A., but, fortunately for her husband's credit, was pre vented ; for that learned gentleman, suddenly recollecting it would be necessary to rise at five the next morning, to \" run over \" his speech, made a hasty retreat, and left his amiable consort to her own orude speculations upon tho subject. Precisely as St. Paul's struck five did Mr. Peter Pan cake arise from his couch, and after rubbing his eyes, and assuring himself that he was Mr. Pancake\u2014 the identical Mr. Pancake, who was to figure in that day's annals\u2014 he dressed himself in his best suit of pepper-and-salt, and descended to the little parlour ; there upon the self-same stool which had held him the night before\u2014 with the Belf same roU of paper in his hand, did this extraordinary individual proceed to pour into the ears of the china cats Peter the second was accordingly sent to coUege, sig nalized himself by his dexterity in kilUng flies, and his adroitness in playing leap-frog\u2014 which latter deUghtful accompUshment he practised daily with his friend the Gyp, wlose social intercourse he generously repaid by handing"], [138, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 120 and dogs on the chimney-piece his patriotic oration\u2014 that oration which was to surprise and astonish all London, and to gain for him laurels that should never fade. It was just eight o'clock when Mr. Pancake descended from his eminence, and oh ! how impatiently did he take out his watch and count the hours that must intervene before the one would arrive which was to decide his fate ; and looking up to the ceiUng he exclaimed, with heroic forti tude, \" To be, or not to be ? that's the question ! Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer trifles Ught as air to be the confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ, or by op posing end them\u2014 Aye, there's the rub.\" Mr. Peter Pancake could wait not longer, but the next moment was seen trudging off at a rapid pace in the direction of the school-house, where the scene of action was to take place. After the alderman of the ward had declared Mr. Peter Pancake a member of their honourable body, he caUed unon that gentleman to address the meeting. Nothing daunted by the presence of a crowded assembly, Mr. Peter Pancake mounted the platform, drew himself up to his full height, and then poUtely touching his wig to the audience, thus began \u2014 \"To be sure, lovey dovey; but I don't think it quite the thing to wear pattens on Sunday, and to put your head out of the window when you hear a knock at the private door. I never see Mrs. Deputy Ninepin wear pattens on a Sunday, or put her head out of the window.\" \" But, Peter, what am I to do when I've got a soUed cap on ? Yon know I can't have a new cap every day \u2014 blond comes expensive.\" \"WeU, lovey dovey, but can't you just take a peep through the keyhole, and keep your clean cap in the passage all ready to put on at a moment's notice ? \" \" To be sure,\" replied she. \" Now just let me have a moment's peace ; you're always a talking, Mr. P.\" The good gentleman's conversation being thus suddenly cut short, he replenished his pipe, and reveUed in visions of coming greatness. Each day did our newly-elected councUman grow in dignity and importance \u2014 each day did his constituents hail him as he passed their shops, to have a friendly chat with their \" honourable member,\" and inquire after the health of his lady; and, reminding him of the day of election, when they \" hastened to the Ward mote to hold their hands to his name,\" never faUed to wind up by drawing his attention to some choice article of their respective trades, which they could \" let him have a bargain.\" \" AU the world's a stage, and aU the men and women's players. Yes, Mr. Alderman, you are a player.\" \" I'm not,\" replied that venerable functionary. \"You are, for Shakspeare says so,\" firmly resumed Mr. Pancake. The mazarine gown at length made its appearance. Mr. P. was in raptures \u2014 the colour, the fur, the plaiting down the back, were to him the concentration of all that was bright and beautiful. But Mrs. P. (the partner of his life, and who ought to have been the sharer of his happiness) would not think it handsome; nor could aU the impassioned eloquence of her ecstatic husband per suade her it was worth the having, much less worth the ten golden guineas, which the robemaker could not be persuaded to exchange for sausages. \" Shakspeare's a humbug !\" said the Alderman. \" You're another ! \" shouted the crowd. \"Go on; aU right, Peter ! \" \" And you, my good people, are the foot-lights.\" \" No ! no ! \" vociferated the audience. \" You are ! \" screamed Mr. P. \" Then we'll set you on fire, you bundle of rubbish,\" said one. \" Frizzle away, Pancake ! \" shouted another. \" I'U extinguish you aU, you oily vagabones,\" continued Mr. P., in a rage. \" I'U put you aU out in a jiffy.\" \" Then who'll Ught you next election into the Common Council ? \" said a wag. The alderman, thinking it by this time necessary to interpose, shouted, \" Order ! \" \" Silence ! \" tiU he was almost black in the face, and the assembly, knowing his predisposition to apoplexy, were induced at length to aUow Mr. Pancake to proceed. \" Gentlemen, Shakspeare says, ' Lowliness is young Ambition's ladder, whereto the cUmher upward turns his face, looks in the clouds, and scorns the base degrees by which he did ascend.' Gentlemen, I have arrived to the clouds, you are the ladder by which I did ascend.\" \"No, no,\" reiterated the crowd. Oh ! how Mr. Pancake sweUed with pride when he put on this robe of office, and repaired to the first court of Common CouncU which it was his privilege to attend. Walking through the Guildhall with the solemn dignity of a judge, he entered the councU chamber, paused for a moment to coUect his scattered thoughts, and bowed reverently to the court, which act of obeisance the court happening not to see, could not possibly be expected to return. There sat the Lord Mayor in the chair of state ; on either side were the substantial-looking aldermen arranged, and in their midst might be seen the busy City Marshal, whose employment consisted in gently awakening those dozing dignitaries when his lordship required their votes ; and the sober-faced Town Clerk, too, with his irre sistible wig, added considerable dignity to the scene. Mr. P. was overcome. The hammer went down, and the busi ness of the meeting commenced. The subject under dis cussion that day was a motion, brought in by one of the deputies, to consider the necessity of petitioning Govern ment to take the duty off turtles, which gave rise to a most animated five hours' discussion. Mr. Pancake, after listening patiently for three hours and a-half, felt power fully moved to make a remark ; raising his hands and eyes to heaven, he solemnly expressed his determination to oppose the motion, and was proceeding to teU that honour able court how \" aU the world was a stage, and all the men and women actors,\" when he was interrupted by the hoots and cries of the court, who, one and all, pronounced him to be a \" fresh 'un,\" and consequently incapable of giving an opinion upon the turtle question.

And fields which promise corn and wine, And scatter'd cities crowning these, Whose far white walls along them shine, Have strew'd a scene, which I should see With double joy wert thou with me. And peasant girls, ivith deep blue eyes, And hands which offer early flowers, Oft had she hail'd its trophied prow, Victorious from the war, And banner'd masts that would not bow, Though riven with many a scar ; Oft had her oaks their tribute brought, To rib its flanks, with thunder fraught ; But late her evil star Had cursed it on its homeward way, \u2014 \" The spoUer shall become the prey.\" Walk snuling o'er this paradise ; Above, the frequent feudal towers Through green leaves lift their walls of gray, i And many a rock which steeply lowers, And noble arch in proud decay, Look o'er this vale of vintage-bowers ; But one thing want these banks of Rhine\u2014 Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine.

No fears the brave adventurers knew ; Peril and death they spurn'd ; Like full-fledg'd eagles forth they flew; Jove's birds that proudly burn'd, Iu battle-hurricanes to wield His Ughtnings on the bUlowy field ; And many a look they turn'd O'er the blue waste of waves, to spy A GaUie ensign in the sky. The river nobly foams and flows, The charm of this enchanted ground, And all its thousand turns disclose Some fresher beauty varying round ; The haughtiest breast its wish might bound Through life to dwell delighted here ; Nor could a spot on earth be found To nature and to me so dear, Could thy dear eyes, in foUowing mine, StiU sweeten more these banks of Rhine !

A barking sound the shepherd hears, A cry as of a dog or fox ; He halts, and searches with his eyes Among the scatter' d rocks ; And now at distance can discern A stirring in a brake of fern, And instantly a dog is seen Glancing from that covert green. The dog is not of mountain breed, Its motions, too, are wUd and shy, With something, as the shepherd thinks, Unusual in its cry ; Nor is there anyone in sight AU round, in hoUow or on height ; Nor shout nor whistle strikes his ear \u2014 What is the creature doing here ?

O'er all the pleasant land. The deer across their greensward bound Thro' shade and sunny gleam, And the swan glides past them with tho sound Of some rejoicing stream. At night he heard the lion roar, And the hy\u00e6n-i scream, And the river-horse, as he crushed the reed3 The merry homes of England ! Around their hearths by night, What gladsome looks of household love Beside some hidden stream ; And it passed, Uke a glorious roll of drums, Through the triumph of his draam. Meet, iu the ruddy light ! There woman's voice flows forth in song, Or childhood's tale is told, Or lips move tunefully along * Some glorious page of old. The forests, with their myriad tongues, Shouted of Uberty ; And the Blast of the Desert cried aloud, With a voice so wUd and free, That he started in his sleep and smiled At their tempestuous glee. The blessed homes of England ! How softly on then- bowers Is laid the holy quietness That breathes from Sabbath hours ! He did not feel the driver's whip, Nor the burning heat of day ; For Death had Ulumined the Land of Sleep, And his lifeless body lay \u2014 A worn-out fetter, that the soul Had broken and thrown away. Solemn, yet sweet, the church bell's chimo Floats thro' their woods at morn ; All other sounds, in that still time, Of breeze and leaf are born."], [151, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 133 Now mistress GUpin (careful soul !) Had two stone bottles found, To hold the Uquor that she loved, To keep it safe and sound. JOHN GILPIN'S RIDE. John Gilpin was a citizen Of credit and renown, A trainband captain eke was he Of famous London town. Each bottle had a curling ear, Through which the belt he dri w, And hung a bottle on each side, To make his balance true. John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear, \" Though wedded we have been These twice ten tedious years, yet we No holiday have seen. Then over all, that he might be Equipp'd from top to toe, His long red cloak, well brush'd and neaS, He manfully did throw. u To-morrow is our wedding-day, And we will then repair Unto the Bell at Edmonton AU in a chaise and pair. Now see him mounted once again Upon his nimble steed, Full slowly pacing o'er the stones, With caution and good heed. \" My sister, and my sister's child, Myself, and children three, WUl fiU the chaise ; so you must rido On horseback after we.\" But finding soon a smoother road Beneath his well-shod feet, The snorting beast began to trot, Which gall'd him in his seat. He soon replied, \" I do admire Of womankind but one, And you are she, my dearest dear, Therefore it shall be done. So \" fair and softly,\" John he cried, But John he cried in vain ; \" I am a linendraper bold, As aU the world doth know, And my good friend the calender Will lend his horse to go.\" That trot became a gaUop soon, In spite of curb and rein. So stooping down as needs he must Who cannot sit upright, He grasp'd the mane with both his hanils^ And eke with aU his might. Quoth Mrs. GUpin, \" That's well said ;. And for that wine is dear, We wiU be fumish'd with our own, Which is both bright and clear.\" His horse, who never in that sort Had handled been before, What thing upon his back had got Did wonder more and more. John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife ; O'erjoyed was he to find, That, though on pleasure she was bent, She had a frugal mind. The morning came, the chaise was brought, But yet was not allow'd To drive up to the door, lest all Should say that she was proud. Away went GUpin \u2014 neck or nought ; Away went hat and wig. He little dreamt when he set out, Of running such a rig ! So three doors off the chaise was stay'd, Where they did all get in ; Six precious souls, and all agog To dash through thick and thin. The wind did blow, the cloak did fly, Like streamer long and gay, Till, loop and button fading both, At last it flew away. Then might all people well discern The bottles he had slung \u2014 A bottle swinging at each side, As hath been said or sung. Smack went the whip, round went the wheels, Were never folk so glad, The stones did rattle underneath, As if Cheapside were mad. The dogs did bark, the children screamcil, Up flew the windows aU ; And every soul cried out, \" Well done !\" As loud as he could bawl. John GUpin at his horse's side Seized fast the flowing mane, And up he got, in haste to ride, But soon came down again ; Away went GUpin \u2014 who but he ? His fame soon spread around, \" He carries weight \u2014 he rides a race\u2014 'Tis for a thousand pound !\" For saddletree scarce reach'd had he, His journey to begin, When, turning round his head, he saw Three customers come in. And still, as fast as he drew near, 'Twas wonderful to view, How in a trice the turnpike men Their gates wide open threw. So down he came ; for loss of time, Although it grieved him sore, Yet loss of pence, full well he knew, Would trouble him much more. And now, as he went bowing down His reeking head full low, The bottles twain behind his back Were shattered at a blow. 'Twas long before the customers Were suited to their mind, When Betty screaming came downstairs, \" The wine is left behind !\" Down ran the wine into the road, Most piteous to be seen, Which made his horse's flanks to smok\u00ab As they had basted been. \" Good lack !\" quoth he\u2014\" yet bring it me, My leathern belt likewise, In which I bear my trusty sword When I do exercise.\""], [152, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 134 Said John, \" It is my wedding-day, And all the world would stare, H wife should dine at Edmonton, And I should dine at Ware !\" But stUl he seemed to carry weight, With leathern girdle braced; For aU might see the bottle necks StiU dangling at his waist. So turning to his horse, he said : \" I am in haste to dine ; 'Twas for your pleasure you came here\u2014 You shaU go back for mine.\" Thus all through merry IsUngton These gambols he did play, UntU he came unto the Wash Of Edmonton so gay. Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast ! For which he paid fuU dear ; For, whUe he spake, a braying ass Did sing most loud and clear; And there he threw the wash about On both sides of the way, Just Uke unto a trundling mop, Or a wild goose at play. Whereat his horse did snort, as he Had heard a lion roar, At Edmonton, his loving wife From the balcony spied Her tender husband, wondering much To see how he did ride. And gaUop'd off with aU his might, As he had done before. Away went GUpin, and away Went Gilpin's hat and wig : He lost them sooner than at first, For why ? \u2014 they were too big. \" Stop \u2014 stop, John Gilpin \u2014 here's the houso !\" They aU at once did cry ; \" The dinner waits, and we are tired.\" Said GUpin\u2014\" So am I !\" Now Mistress GUpin, when she saw Her husband posting down Into the country far away, She puUed out half-a-crown ; But yet his horse was not a whit Inclined to tarry there \u2014 Por why ? \u2014 his owner had a house FuU ten rmles off, at Ware. And thus unto the youth she said, That drove them to the Bell : So Uke an arrow swift he flew, Shot by an archer strong ; So did he fly \u2014 which brings me to The middle of my song. \" This shaU be yours when you bring back My husband safe and weU.\" The youth did ride, and soon did meet John coming back amain ; Whom in a trice he tried to stop, By catching at his rein ; Away went GUpin out of breath, And sore against his wiU, TiU at his friend the calender's His horse at last stood stiU. But not performing what he meant, And gladly would have done, The frighted steed he frighted more, And made him faster run. The calender, amazed to see His neighbour in such trim, Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate, And thus accosted him : Away went GUpin, and away Went postboy at his heels \u2014 The postboy's horse right glad to mis3 The lumbering of the wheels. \" What news \u2014 what news ? \u2014 your tidings teU : TeU me you must and shaU ! Say why bareheaded you are come, Or why you come at aU ?\" Six gentlemen upon the road, Thus seeing Gilpin fly, With postboy scampering in the rear, They raised the hue and cry : Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit, And loved a timely joke, And thus unto the calender In merry guise he spoke : \" Stop thief ! \u2014 stop thief ! \u2014 a highwayman !' Not one of them was mute ; And aU and each that pass'd that way Did join in the pursuit. \" I came because your horse would come ; And, if I well forebode, My hat and wig will soon be here\u2014 They are upon the road.\" And now the turnpike gates again Flew open in short space \u2014 The toll-men thinking as before, That GUpin rode a race. The calender, right glad to find His friend in merry pin, Return'd him not a single word, But to the house went in, And so he did, and won it too, For he got first to town ; Nor stopp'd tiU where he had got up He did again get down. Whence straight he came with hat and wig\u2014 A wig that flowed behind \u2014 A hat not much the worse for wear, Each comely in its kind. Now let us sing, long live the King, And Gilpin long live he ; And when he next doth ride abroad, May I be there to see ! He held them up, and in his turn Thus showed his ready wit : \" My head is twice as big as yours, They therefore needs must fit. POETIC LABOUR. But let me scrape the dirt away That hangs upon your face ; And stop and eat, for well you may Be in a hungry case.\" They best can teU a poet's worth, Who oft themselves have known The pangs of a poetic birth, By labours of their own."], [153, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 135 ALEXANDER SELKIRK. WE ARE SEVEN. I am monarch of all I survey, My right there is none to dispute ; From the centre all round to the sea I am lord of the fowl and the brute. O SoUtudo ! where are the charms A simple chUd, That lightly draws its breath, And feels its Use in every limb, What should it know of death ? That sages have seen in thy face ? Better dwell in the midst of alarms I met a Uttle cottage girl, She was eight years old, she said ; Her hair was thick with many a curl That cluster'd round her head. Than reign in this horrible place. I am out of humanity's reach, I must finish my journey alone, Never hear the sweet music of speech, I start at the sound of my own. The beasts, that roam over the plain, My form with indifference see ; They are so unacquainted with man, Their sameness is shocking to me.

Compared with the speed of its flight, The tempest itself lags behind, And the swift-winged arrows of light. When I think of my own native land, In a moment I seem to be there ; But alas ! recollection at hand \" You run about, my little maid, Your limbs they are aUve ; If two are in the churchyard laid, Then ye are only five.\" \" Their graves are green, they may be seen,\" The Uttle maid repUed, \" Twelve steps or more from my mother's door, Soon hurries me back to despair.

Since now-a-days there's every man Attempting emigration, Why should not I propose a plan To benefit the nation ? His son \u2014 a gay, young swaggering blade \u2014 Abhorr'd the very thoughts of trade ; And lest reflection should be thrown On him, resolved to leave the town, And travel where he was not known. With gilded coach and liveries gay, Long have I thought it in my miud, To find a fitting home Might seem by Nature's self designed For kindred souls to roam. To Oxford first he took his way. The bucks and beaus his taste admire, His equipage and gay attire ; The brewers should to Malta go, The loggerheads to SciUy, The Quakers to the Friendly Isles, The furriers all to ChiU. The little bawUng, squaUing elves, Who break our nightly rest, While their nurses haste to Babylon, But most of all that was adored Was his fine silver-hilted sword : \u2014 Tho' small and short, 'twas vastly neat \u2014 The sight was deemed a perfect treat. Beau Banter begged to have a look ; And when in hand the sword he took, He swore, by Gad, it was an odd thing, And look'd just like a tailor's bodkin. Beau Shred was hurt at this expression, And thought he knew his mean profession ; Sheathing his sword, he sneaked away, And drove to Gloucester the same day. There soon he found fresh cause for grief, For dining on some fine roast beef, Go to Lapland or to* Brest. From Spithead, cooks run over Greece ; And whUe the miser waits His passage to the Guinea Coast, The spendthrift's in the Straits. | To Geneva quick whUe drunkards hie, At the Needles spinsters be, They asked him which he did prefer, Some cabbage or some cucumber ? What was designed as compUment He thought severe reflection meant ; His stomach turned, he could not eat, So made an ungenteel retreat ; Next day left Gloucester in great wrath, And bid his coachman drive to Bath : There he suspected fresh abuse While gourmands lunch at Sandwich Isles,- 'TwUl suit them to a T. Musicians hasten to the Sound, The surplus priests to Rome ; WhUe still the race of hypocrites At Canton are at home. Send bachelors to th' United States, Maids to the Isle of Man ; Let gardeners all to Botany go, And shoeblacks to Japan. Because the dinner was roast goose ; And that he might no more be jeered, To Exeter directly steered. There with the bucks he drank about, Until he thought they'd found him out; His glass not fiUed, as 'twas his rule, They said 'twas not a thimble-full. The name of thimble was enough \u2014 He paid his reck'ning, and went off : Next day to Plymouth he removed, And there as unsuccessful proved \u2014 For, though he fiUed his glass or cup, He did not always drink it up. The topers mark'd how he behaved, And said \" a remnant shall be saved.\" The name of remnant gall'd him so\u2014 - He then resolved for York to go ; There filled his bumper to the top, And always fairly drank it up.

In their noon-day dreams : From my wings are shaken the dews that waken The sweet birds every one, When rocked to rest on their mother's breast, As she dances about the sun. I wield the flaU of the lashing hail, And whiten the green plains under ; And then again I dissolve it in rain, And laugh as I pass in thunder.

And stUl and stUl I felt as if I gazed Whilst he is dissolving in rains. The sanguine sunrise, with his meteor eyes, And his burning plumes outspread, Leaps on the back of my saUing rack, When the morning star shines dead ; For the first time ! Great was the tumult there, Deafening the din, when in barbaric pomp The Carthaginian, on his march to Rome, Entered their fastnesses. Trampling the snows, The war-horse reared ; and the towered elephant Upturned his trunk into the murky sky, Then tumbled headlong, swaUowed up and lost, He and his rider. As on the jag of a mountain crag, Which an earthquake rocks and swings, An eagle aUt, one moment may sit, In the ljght of its golden wings. And when sunset may breathe, from the Ut sea beneath, Its ardours of rest and love, And the crimson paU of eve may faU From the depth of heaven above ; With wings folded I rest on mine airy nest, As stUl as a brooding dove. Now the scene is changed ; And o'er the Simplon, o'er the Splugen winds, A path of pleasure. Like a sUver zone Flung about carelessly, it shines afar, Catching the eye in many a broken Jink, In many a turn and traverse as it gUdes ; And oft above and oft below appears, Seen o'er the waU by him who journeys up, As if it were another, through the wild, Leading along he knows not whence or whither. Yet, through its fairy course, go where it wUl, The torrent stops it not, the rugged rock < Opens and lets it in ; and on it runs, Winning its easy way from clime to cUme Through glens socked up befora. Not such my path 1 Tlie very path for them that dare defy Danger, nor shrink, wear he what shape he will ; That o'er the caldron, when the flood boUs up, Hang as in air, gazing and shuddering on TiU fascination comes and the brain turns ! The very path for them, that Ust, to choose Where best to plant a monumental cross, And Uve in story Uke Empedocles ; A track for heroes, such as he who came, Ere long, to win, to wear the iron crown ; And (if aright I judge from what I felt Over the Drance, just where the abbot feU RoUed downward in an after-dinner sleep), The same as Hannibal's. But now 'tis passed, That orbed maiden, with white fire laden, Whom mortals call the moon, Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor, By the midnight breezes strewn ; And wherever the beat of her unseen feet, Which only the angels hear, May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof, The stars peep behind her and peer ; \u2014 And I laugh to see them whirl and flee, Like a swarm of golden bees, When I widen the rent in my wind -built tent, TiU the calm rivers, lakes, and seas, Like strips of the sky faUen through me on high, Are each paved with the moon and these. I hind the sun's throne with a burning zone, And the moon's with a girdle of pearl ; The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim, When the whirlwinds my banners unfurl. From cape to cape, with a bridge-bke shape, Over a torrent sea, Sunbeam proof, I hang like a roof, The mountains its columns be.

A stranger journey'd through the town, One dark and wintry night ; And,' as he pass'd the ivied church, He mark'd a flitting Ught. He had died in the midst of his career, As the sinful ever die ; Without one prayer from a good man's heart, One tear from a good man's eye. He had died a gmlty one, unbless'd, Unwept, unmourn'd by all ; And scarce a footstep ever bent To his grave by the old church wall. It shed a restless waving gleam Through the Gothic window-pane, And now it vanished for a space, And now it came again. \u25a0 The other three had met that night, And reveUed in drunken glee ; He stood, and thought it wondrous strange That such a scene should be ; And talk'd of him who, a month ago, Formed one of their company. He stood, and now the fuU, red beam Shone strong and steadily. They quaffed another brimming glass, He look'd around; aU else was dark, Not e'en a star was left ; And a noisy oath they swore, That he who had join'd their game so oft, Should join their game once more. The townsmen slumber' d, and he thought Of sacrUege and theft. And away they strode to the old church wall, Treading o'er skuU and tomb; And dragg'd him out triumphantly, He roused two sleepers from their beds, And told what he had seen ; And they, like him, were curious To know what it should mean. In the midnight murky gloom. They hied together to the church, And heard strange sounds within, They carry him down the chancel porch, And through the fretted aisle ; And many a heartless fiendish laugh Of undistinguishable words, And laughter's noisy din.

The window's high ; a ladder \u2014 quick\u2014 'Tis placed with stealthy care, They place him at the haUow'd shrine, They caU upon his name ; And one ascends \u2014 he looks below ; Oh ! what a sight is there ! They bid him wake to life again, And play his olden game. The white communion-cloth is spread With cards, and dice, and wine ; The flaming wax-Ughts glare around, The gilded sconces shine. They deal the cards ; the ribald jest, The pealing laugh ring on ; A stroke \u2014 a start \u2014 the echoing clock Proclaims the hour of one ! And two of the three laugh louder stiU, And three of earthly form have made The altar-rail their seat, But the third stares wildly round ; He drops the cards, as if his hand With tho Bible and the books of prayer As footstools for their feet. Were palsied at the sound. Three men, with flashing bloodshot eyes And burning fevered brows, His cheeks have lost their deepen'd flush, His Ups are of paler hue ; And fear hath faUen on tho heart Have met within these holy walls To gamble and carouse.

But the darkest work is not yet told : Another guest is there, With the earthworm trailing o'er his cheek His soul is not yet firmly bound In the fetters of reckless sin ; Depravity hath not yet wrought To hide in his matted hair ! Its total work within.

And soon the dreadful tale is spread, And many a finger raised Dread is the time when I move sublime On my fiery cloud-capt car ; When my Ughtnings flash, and my big clouds clash, To point them out ; whUe the Ustening one Looks fearfuUy amazed. In the boundless realms afar ! They are shunned by aU \u2014 the son, the sire, The heedless and the gay ; My bursting cloud speaks forth aloud, With a voice that thrills with awe, , Like a rending rock, or an earthquake's shock, Then- old associates leave their side, And turn another way. Or the din of a distant war. Then, this is the time for the mind to climb From grovelUng thoughts to thoughts sublime. Hate, shame, and scorn have set a mark Upon them ; one by one, Of aU they knew, forsakes their path, TiU they are left alone. Whenever I'm heard the crouching bird Sits mute, with ruffled plume ; WhUe the bleating train forsake the plain, Or imploringly gaze on the gloom. Beneath my track the sea looks black, And opes with a dismal yawn, Or boils and raves, with frothing waves And they have sought another land, And breathe another dime ; Where men may deem them feUow-men Nor hear their blasting crime.

Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray, And, when I crossed the wild, \"Adieu, adieu! my native shore Fades o'er the waters blue ; I chanced to see, at break of day, The soUtary chUd.

Not blither is the mountain roe ; With many a wanton stroke Her feet disperse the powdery snow That rises up like smoke. \" Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high, I fear not wave nor wind : Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I Am sorrowful in mind ; The storm came on before its time ; She wander'd up and down, And many a hUl did Lucy cUmb, But never reached the town. For I have from my father gone, A mother whom I love, And have no friend, save these alone, But thee \u2014 and One above. The wretched parents all that night Went shouting far and wide ; But there was neither sound nor sight To serve them for a guide. \" My father bless'd me fervently, Yet did not much complain ; But sorely will my mother sigh TiU I come back again.\" \" Enough, enough, my little lad, Such tears become thine eye ; If I thy gmleless bosom had, Mine own would not be dry.

Actuated by this beautiful and touching impulse (among the best impulses of our imperfect nature, gentlemen), the lonely and desolate widow dried her tears, furnished her first-floor, caught her innocent boy to her maternal bosom, and put the bill up in her parlour-window. Did it remain there long ? No. The serpent was on the watch, the train was laid, the mine was preparing, the sapper and miner was at work. Before the biU had been in the parlour-window three days \u2014 three days, gentle men \u2014 a Being, erect upon two legs, aud bearing all the outward semblance of a man, and not of a monster, knocked at the door of Mrs. BardeU's house. He inquired within ; he took the lodgings ; and on the very next day he entered into possession of them. This man was Pickwick \u2014 Pick wick, the defendant.\" THE ADDRESS OF SERJEANT BUZFUZ. Bardell v. Pickwick. Serjeant Buzfuz began by saying, that never, in the whole course of his professional experience \u2014 never, from the very first moment of his applying himself to the study and practice of the law \u2014 had he approached a case with feelings of such deep emotion, or with such a heavy sense of the responsibiUty imposed upon him \u2014 a responsibUity, he would say, which he could never have supported, were he not buoyed up and sustained by a conviction so strong, that it amounted to positive certainty that the cause of truth and justice, or, in other words, the cause of his much-injured and most oppressed client, must prevaU with the high-minded and inteUigent dozen of men whom he now saw in that box before him. Counsel always begin in this way, because it puts the jury on the very best terms with themselves, and makes them think what sharp feUows they must be. A visible effect was produced immediately ; several jurymen begin ning to take voluminous notes with the utmost eagerness. \" You have heard from my learned friend, gentlemen,\" continued Serjeant Buzfuz, well knowing that, from the learned friend aUuded to, the gentlemen of the jury had heard just nothing at aU\u2014 \"you have heard from mylearned friend, gentlemen, that this is an action for a breach of promise of marriage',' in which the damages are laid at \u00a31,500. But you have not heard from my learned friend, inasmuch as it did not come within my learned friend's province to teU you, what are the facts and circumstances of the case. Those facts and circumstances, gentlemen, you shall hear detaUed by me, and proved by the unim peachable female whom I will place in that box before you.\" Here Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, with a tremendous^ em phasis on the word \" box,\" smote his table with a mighty sound, and glanced at Dodson and Fogg, who nodded admiration of the serjeant, and indignant defiance of the Serjeant Buzfuz, who had proceeded with such volu bUity tlsat his face was perfectly crimson, here paused for breath. The sUence awoke Mr. Justice Stareleigh, who immediately wrote down something with a pen without any ink in it, and looked unusuaUy profound, to impress the jury with the beUef that he always thought most deeply with his eyes shut. Serjeant Buzfuz proceeded. \" Of this man Pickwick I wUl say little ; the subject presents but few attractions ; and I, gentlemen, am not the man, nor are you, gentlemen, the men, to delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness, and of syste matic viUainy.\" Here Mr. Pickwick, who had been writhing in silence for some time, gave a violent start, as if some vague idea of assaulting Serjeant Buzfuz, in the august presence of jus tice and law, suggested itself to his mind. An admonitory gesture from Perker restrained him, and he Ustened to the learned gentleman's continuation with a look of indig nation, which contrasted forcibly with the admiring faces of Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders. \"I say systematic viUainy, gentlemen,\" said Serjeant Buzfuz, [looking through Mr. Pickwick, and talking at him ; \" and when I say systematic vUlainy, let me teU the defendant Pickwick, if he be in court, as I am informed he is, that it would have been more decent in him, more becoming, in better judgment, and in better taste, if he had kept away. Let me tell him, gentlemen, that any gestures of dissent or disapprobation in which he may indulge in this court wiU not go down with you ; that you wiU know how to value and how to appreciate them ; and let me teU him further, as my lord wiU tell you, gentle men, that a counsel, in the discharge of his duty to his cUent, is neither to be intimidated nor buUied, nor put down ; and that any attempt to do either the one or the other, or the first, or the last, wUl recoil on the head of the attempter, be he plaintiff or be he defendant, be his name Pickwick, or Noakes, or Stoakes, or Stiles, or Brown, or Thompson.\" This Uttle divergence from the subject in hand, had of course the intended effect of turning aU eyes to Mr. Pick wick. Serjeant Buzfuz, having partiaUy recovered from the state of moral elevation into which he had lashed defendant. \" The plaintiff, gentlemen,\" continued Serjeant Buzfuz, in a soft and melancholy voice, \" the plaintiff is a widow ; yes, gentlemen, a widow. The late Mr. Bardell, after enjoying, for many years, the esteem and confidence of his sovereign, as one of the guardian* of his royal revenues, glided almost imperceptibly from the world, to seek else where for that repose and peace which a custom-house can never afford.\" At this pathetic description of the decease of Mr. Bardell, who had been knocked on the head with a quart pot in a public-house ceUar, the learned serjeant's voice faltered, and he proceeded with emotion \u2014 \" Some time before his death, he had stamped his like ness upon a Uttle boy. With this Uttle boy, the only pledge of her departed exciseman, Mrs. BardeU shrunk from the world, and courted the retirement and tranquUUty of GosweU-street ; and here she placed in her front parlour window a written placard, bearing this inscription\u2014 'Apartments furnished for a single gentleman. Inquire within.' \" Here Serjeant Buzfuz paused, whUe several gentlemen of the jury took a note of the document. \" There is no date to that, is there, sir ? \" inquired a \" There is no date, gentlemen,\" replied Serjeant Buzfuz, \"but I am instructed to say that it was put in the plaintiff's parlour-window just this time three years. I entreat the attention of the jury to the wording of this document\u2014 'Apartments furnished for a single gentle man ' ' Mrs. BardeU's opinions of the opposite sex, gen tlemen, were derived from a long contemplation of the inestimable quaUties of her lost husband. She had no fear\u2014 she had no distrust\u2014 she had no suspicion\u2014 all was confidence and reUance. ' Mr. BardeU,' said the widow ; 'Mr. BardeU was a man of honour-Mr. BardeU was a man of his word-Mr. BardeU was no deceiver-Mr- himself, resumed: \"I shaU show you, gentlemen, that for two years Pickwick continued to reside constantly, and without interruption or intermission, at Mrs. BardeU's house. 1 shall show you that Mrs. Bardell, during the whole of that time, waited on him, attended to his comforts, cooked his meals, looked out his linen for the washerwoman when \u00bb went abroad, darned, aired, and prepared it for wear when it came home, and, in short, enjoyed his fullest trust and confidence. I shaU show you that, on many"], [160, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 142 Buzfuz, \"it is difficult to smUe with an aching heart ; it is iU jesting when our deepest sympathies are awakened. My cUent's hopes and prospects are ruined, and it is no figure of speech to say that her occupation is gone indeed. The biU is down\u2014 but there is no tenant. EUgible single gentlemen pass and repass\u2014 but there is no invitation for them to inquire within, or without. AU is gloom and silence in the house ; even the voice of the chud is hushed ; his infant sports are disregarded when his mother weeps ; his ' aUey tors ' and his ' commoneys ' are alike neglected; he forgets the long famiUar cry of ' knuckle-down,' and at tip-cheese, or odd and even, his hand is out. But Pick wick, gentlemen, Pickwick, the ruthless destroyer of this domestic oasis in the desert of GosweU-street\u2014 Pickwick, who has choaked up the well, and thrown ashes on the sward \u2014 Pickwick, who comes before you to-day with his heartless tomato sauce and warming-pans \u2014 Pickwick stUl rears his head with unblushing estrontery, and gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has made.

And for those damages she now appeals to an enUghtened, a high-minded, a right-feeUng, a conscientious, a dispassionate, a sympathising, a con templative jury of her civilized countrymen.\" With this beautiful peroration, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz sat down, and Mr. Justice Stareleigh woke up. occasions, he gave half-pence, and on some occasions, even sixpences, to her little boy ; and I shall prove to you, by a witness whose testimony it wUl be impossible for my learned friend to weaken or controvert, that on one occa sion he patted the boy on the head, and, after inquiring whether he had won any alley tors or commoneys lately (both of which I understand to bo a particular species of marbles much prized by the youth of this town), made use of this remarkable expression\u2014' How should you Uke to have another father ?' I shaU prove to you, gentlemen, that about a year ago, Pickwick suddenly began to absent himself from home during long intervals, as if with the intention of gradually breaking off from my client ; but I shall show you also that his resolution was not at that time sufficiently strong, or that his better feelings con quered, if better feeUngs he has, or that the charms and accomplishments of my client prevailed against his un manly intentions ; by proving to you that on one occasion, when he returned from the country, he distinctly and in terms offered her marriage ; previously, however, taking special care that there should be no witnesses to their solemn contract ; and I am in a situation to prove to you, on the testimony of three of his own friends, \u2014 most un wiUing witnesses, gentlemen \u2014 most unwiUing witnesses that on that morning he was discovered by them holding the plaintiffin his arms, and soothing her agitation by his caresses and endearments.\" A visible impression was produced upon the auditors by this part of the learned serjeant's address. Drawing forth two very small scraps of paper, he proceeded \u2014 HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY. \"And now, gentlemen, but one word more. Two letters have passed between these parties, letters which are admitted to be in the handwriting of the defendant, and which speak volumes indeed. These letters, too, bespeak the character of the man. They are not open, fervent, eloquent epistles, breathing nothing but the lan guage of affectionate attachment. They are covert, sly, underhanded communications, but, fortunately, far more conclusive than if couched in the most glowing language and the most poetic imagery \u2014 letters that must be viewed with a cautious and suspicious eye \u2014 letters that were evi dently intended at the time, by Pickwick, to mislead and delude any third parties into whose hands they might faU. Let me read the first : \u2014 ' Gam-way's, twelve o'clock. Dear Mrs. B.\u2014 Chops and Tomata sauce. Yours, Pickwick.' Gentlemen, what does this mean ? Chops and Tomata sauce. Yours, Pickwick ! Chops ! Gracious heavens ! and Tomata sauce ! Gentlemen, is the happiness of a sensitive and confiding female to be trifled away by such shallow artifices as these ? The next has no date what ever, which is in itself suspicious. \u2014 ' Dear Mrs. B., I shaU not be at homo till to-morrow. Slow coach.' And then foUows this very, very remarkable expression \u2014 ' Don't trouble yourself about the warming-pan.' The warming pan ! Why, gentlemen, who does trouble himself about a warming-pan ? When was the peace of mind of man or woman broken or disturbed by a warming-pan, which is in itself a harmless, a useful, and I wiU add, gentlemen, a comforting article of domestic furniture ? Why is Mrs. Bardell so earnestly entreated not to agitate herself about this warming-pan, unless (as is no doubt the case) it is a mere cover for hidden fire \u2014 a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise, agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence artfuUy contrived by Pickwick with a view to his contemplated desertion, and which I am not in a condition to explain ? And what does this aUusion to the slow coach mean ? For aught I know, it may be a reference to Pickwick himself, who has most unquestionably been a criminally slow coach during the whole of this transaction, but whose speed wiU now be very unexpectedly accelerated, and whose wheels, gentlemen, as he wiU find to his cost, will very soon be greased by you ! But enough of this, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Serjeant To be, or not to be, that is the question : Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take up arms against a sea of troubles, And, by opposing, end them ? \u2014 To die \u2014 to sleep- No more ; \u2014 and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to : \u2014 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished : To die, \u2014 to sleep ; \u2014 To sleep ! perchance to dream ; ay, there's the rub ; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, \" When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause : \u2014 there's the respect, That makes calamity of so long Use : Por who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin ? who would fardels bear# To groan and sweat under a weary life ; But that the dread of something after death,\u2014 The undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveUer returns, \u2014 puzzles the will 5 And makes us rather bear the iUs we have, Than fly to others that we know not of ! Thus conscience does make cowards of us aU ; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought ; And enterprises of great pith and moment, With this regard, their currents turn awry And lose the name of action. THE MORNING'S DAWN. Slow passed the night, and now, with sUver ray, The star of morning ushers in the day ; The shadows fly before the roseate hours, And the chUl dew hangs glittering on the flowers ; The pruning-hook or bumble spade to wieid, The cheerful labourer hastens to the field."], [161, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 143 WHAT I LIVE FOR. That the first time this famUy settled in Britain, Was when that strong man with the very tough bow, UaUed WUham the Conqueror, swayed this great land, Just as if he had got the said bow in his hand. Sir Robert de Fleece was the name of the gent. Who did this great famUy then represent, And he reaUy was quite a nice man as times went. He had one Uttle fault, But ought I to halt To teU it, dear reader ? Well, since I've begun, 'Tis as weU just to name it ; no harm can be done. I live for those who love me \u2014 For thoso I know are true ; For the heaven that smUes above me, And awaits my spirit, too ; For all human ties that bind me ; For the task by God assigned me ; For the bright hopes left behind me ; And the good that I can do. I live to learn their story AYho've suffered for my sake \u2014 To emulate their glory, And follow in their wake- Bards, patriots, martyrs, sages, The noble of all ages, Whose deeds crowd history's pages, And Time's great volume make. His faiUng was this;\u2014 he by no means could see, Nor perceive, nor find out, nor discern, nor divine The important distinction there is and must be Between the two words, called by us, \"mine\" and \"thine; And what made it worse was, not only that he Made this Uttle mistake with regard to the word, But \u2014 it might be to prove his consistency \u2014 In the spirit as weU as the letter he erred. I live to hold communion With aU that is divine ; To feel there is a union A tale I wiU teU, As it truly befel, Concerning this gentleman, pray heed it weU! 'Twixt Nature's heart and mine ; To profit by affliction ; Reap truths from fields of fiction ; Grow wiser from conviction ; And fulfil each grand design. When Sir Robert came over from France in the train, (I don't mean the railroad\u2014 such things were not then; I refer to the retinue, which, on the main, Consisted of ladies, brave lords, and Uege men) \u2014 The Conqueror couldn't find out where to put him,\u2014 He hadn't a place or a pension to suit him, So he fetched down an earl from his honours and ranks, And gave his possessions \u2014 (he oft played such pranks)\u2014 To Sir Robert de Fleece, who received them\u2014 with thanks. Now this earl had a very deUghtful estate, With a castle which had a large drawbridge and gate, And he kept hawks and hunters and Uved in vast state ; So Sir Fleece, as you'U fancy, was highly elate, And the joy which he felt was exceedingly great. I live to haU that season, By gifted minds foretold, When men shaU Uve by reason, And not alone by gold ; When man to man united, And every wrong thing righted, The whole world shaU be Ughted, As Eden was of old. I live for those who love me\u2014 For those who know me true ; For the heaven that smUes above me, And awaits my spirit too ; For the cause that lacks assistance ; For the wrong that needs resistance; For the future in the distance ; And the good that I can do. There was one Uttle thing, though, which marred his deUght, And made him so sad, it is grievous to teU, \u2014 Not contented with aU the earl's riches and might, He wanted the earl's pretty daughter as weU ! But the earl's pretty daughter rejected his suit, Nay, turned up her nose at him, snubb'd him to boot, And said that she never could bear such a brute ! SIR ROBERT DE FLEECE. 'Tis a common remark in our cities and towns, What a great many Smiths, Joneses, Thompsons and Browns, One fine afternoon he was taking a stroU \u2014 Exceedingly sad and distressed in his soul- Greens, Blacks, Whites and Grays, Days and Johnsons there are !

Why rather, sleep, Uest thou in smoky cribs, Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee, And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber ; Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great, Under the canopies of costly state, And luU'd with sounds of sweetest melody. Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains In cradle of the rude imperious surge ; Where the solar beam, in a dusky stream, Scarce found its straggling way. Helmet and shield and spear were there, Of many an olden make ; And there broke not a sound, on the sUence round, Till the rusted brand thus spake : \u2014 \" Alas ! alas ! for the joyous days When the trumpet called away, And the knights full stern did with ardour burn To join in tho dreadful fray. When the barons bold their serfs led on, And the banners waved around ; Mingled were steel and Lincoln green, On the blood-stained battle ground. And in the visitation of the winds, Who take the ruffian bUlows by the top, Curlir?g their monstrous heads, and hanging them With deaf'ning clamours in the slippery clouds, That, with the hurly, death itself awakes ? Canst thou, oh ! partial sleep, give thy repose To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude ; And in the calmest and the stillest night, With aU appUances aud means to boot, Deny it to a king ?

In a village there lived an old maid Who was ne'er known for trifles to fret, But yet she was sadly afraid That a/husband she never would get, And \" Oh for a husband !\" would constantly sigh, And hope she might have one ere she should die. The next was a lady of rank \u2014 a dame With blood in her veins, you see ; With the leaves of Peerage she fann'd the flame That now was consuming me. But though of her great descent she spoke, I found she was stiU very high ; And I thought looking up to a wife no joke, \u2014 \" There'll be time enough for that,\" said I. She went to her closet to pray, And hoping her prayers might be granted, She never omitted a day To name in her prayers what she wanted ; She hoped and trusted that ere she should die A husband of some sort at least might come by. My next penchant was for one whose face Was her fortune, she was so fair ; Oh ! she spoke with an air of enchanting grace, But a man cannot live upon air ; And when poverty enters the door, young love Will out of the casement fly ; The truth of the proverb I'd no wish to prove,\u2014 \" There'll be time enough for that,\" said I. A thatcher one day through the roof At her prayers espied the old dove, So he popp'd in his head, and gave proof Her devotions were heard from above ; \" Will a thatcher do for you, Miss Wrinkle ?\" said he. \" For better or worse, I'U consent !\" said she.

Think you, that such as you and I, Who drudge and drive through wet and dry, With never ceasing toil, Think you are we less blest than they, Who scarcely own us in their way, As hardly worth their while ? Alas ! how oft in haughty mood, God's creatures they oppress, Or else, neglecting aU that's good, They riot in excess ! Anglicised for Reciting. While winds from off Ben Lomond blow, And bar the doors with driving snow, And draw us round the ingle, I sit me down to pass the time, To spin a verse or two of rhyme, In homely sounding jingle. But whUe the winds blow in the drift, Upon my old hearth-rug, I own I grudge the great folks' gift That live so warm and snug ; Though heed less and need less, Their roomy fireside ; I hanker and canker Both careless and fearless Of either heaven or beU ; Esteeming and deeming 'Tis aU an idle tale ! Then let us freely acquiesce, Nor make our scanty pleasures less By pining at our state ; And even should misfortunes come, As I, who sometimes meet with some, Feel thankful for them yet; They give the wit of age to youth, Our hearts with wisdom fill ; They make us see the naked truth, The real good and ill ; Though losses and crosses To see their cursed pride. 'Tis hardly in a body's power To keep at times from being sour, To see how things are shared ; 'How best of. souls are suffering want, WhUe fools on countless thousands rant, Ne'er think what might be spared. But Davie, lad, ne'er pain your head, Though we have little wealth, We both can win our daUy bread, While we are bless'd with health ; More ask not, nor task not, Are lessons right severe, There's wit there you'U get there, You'U find no other where. Old age ne'er mind a fig ; The last ill, the worst iU, Is only but to beg. But mark me, Davie, ace of hearts To Ue in kilns and barns at e'en, (To say aught less would wrong the cartes, And flattery I detest), This Use has joys for you and I, And joys that riches cannot buy, And joys the very best ; There's aU the pleasures of the heart, Of home, with friends at e'en, You have your Meg., your dearest part, And I my darling Jean. It warms me, it charms me, To mention but her name, It heats me, it beats me, When barns are crazed and blood is thin, Is doubtless great distress. Yet then content could make us blest, E'en then sometimes we'd snatch a taste Of truest happiness. The honest heart that's free from aU Intended fraud or guUe, However fortune kick the baU, Has aye some cause to smUe ; And mind stiU, you'll find stUl A comfort this not smaU, No more, then, we'U care, then, No further can we faU. And sets me aU on flame. Oh ! all ye powers who rule above ! Oh ! thou whose very self art love I What though Uke commoners of air, We wander out we know not where, Thou know'st my word's sincere ! By either house or haU ? Yet nature's charms, the hills and woods, The sweeping vales, and foaming floods, The life blood streaming through my heart, Or my more dear immortal part, Is not more fondly dear ! Are free alike to aU. When heart-corroding care and grief Deprive my soul of rest, In days when daisies deck the ground, And blackbirds whistle clear, Her dear idea brings reUef And solace to my breast. With fondest joy our hearts wiU bound To see the coming year. Thou Being, aU-seeing, Oh ! hear my fervent prayer ! StiU take her, and make her, On hills when we please, then, We'U sit and try a tune ; We'U rhyme to it, and time to it, And sing it when we've done. Thy most peculiar care ! All haU, ye tender feelings dear, The smile of love, the friendly tear, 'Tis not in titles, nor in rank, 'Tis not in wealth, Uke London bank, To purchase peace and rest ; 'Tis not in making plenty more, 'Tis not in books, 'tis not in lore, The sympathetic glow ; Long since this world's thorny ways Had numbered out my wearied days, Had it not been for you. Fate still has blessed me with a friend To make us truly bless'd ; If happiness has not her seat And centre in the breast, We may be wise, or rich, or great, But never can be bless'd : In every care and iU, And oft a more endearing band, A tie more tender stiU. It lightens it brightens, The tenebrific scene, To meet with, and greet with My Davie or my Jean !

High over her they break ; and round her surge and roar ; and giving place to others, moaningly depart, and dash them selves to fragments in their baffled anger. Still she comes onwards bravely. And though the eager multitude crowd thick and fast upon her aU the night, and dawn of day discovers the untiring train yet bearing down upon the ship in an eternity of troubled water, onward she comes, with dim lights burning on her hull, and people there, asleep ; as if no deadly element were peering in at every seam and chink, and no drowned seaman's grave with but a plank to cover it, were yawning in the unfathomable depths below. \" Oh ! if my nierry men did know Where their dying chieftain lay, How quickly would they bear me To my forest realm away. \" They would place me in the greenwood, With the clouds above my head, The red deer bounding by me, And the soft turf for my bed. \" Doth ' Scarlet WiU ' stiU measure staves With ' Much ' the miUer's son, And my kirtle friar play random bouts With merry.'

My stomach is not ruled by other men's, And grumbling for a reason, quaintly begs Wherefore should master rise before the hens Have laid their eggs ?

But I'm happy to state, Mrs. Nicholas Crab Was a lady of excellent temper ; A lady who would not let trifles annoy, or a cross word destroy The peace of her mind\u2014 Oh ! no, never. But were she an angel, you could not expect That she'd never retort, always treat with respect The whims of her querulous lord. Man is but man, so they say, at the best ; And surely the fair sex, along with the rest, Are but mortal. And so Mrs. Crab, Though as sobeT as drab In ordinary mood, Yet, if once put on her mettle, I'll warrant she'd settle A dozen such brood as Old Crab. Here Mr. Nicholas rang the beU. Mr. Nicholas rang to tell His valet de chambre, John Thomas McFell, To bring him his water to shave. But, alas ! here again he could not refrain From grumbling and snarling ; He called John Thomas a scurrilous knave For bringing the water so warm. 'Twas but yesterday morning John Thomas had got A notice to quit because 'twas too hot. Now, what was poor John Thomas to do- Crab swore that the servants had entered a league, Conspired, and desired to annoy and destroy The peace of his mind ! Yes, \" Kiddle-a-Wink, one and all,\" From the drawing-room down to the menial's haU ; He swore at this, he swore at that, The combs, the brushes, soap, razor, and strap, In fact, he swore so hard and so long, So fast and so strong, That the sociable famUy Uving next door, At \" Mrs. Lirriper's Lodgings,\" number one twenty-four ; And my friend, Mr. Fox, who lives \" In the Box \"\u2014 \u2014 ington-road, at least a score Of houses from Crab's, Having thus introduced the pair to your notice, I wiU, with permission, just run through the day As spent by old Crab, in his grurabUng way. The first thing he does when he opens his eyes Is to bewail and lament, with numberless sighs, His wretched condition ; for he vows by the Ught, That he's had no sleep the whole of the night ! No not a wink, \u2014 not so much as a blink UntU morning. Now he would not have added, \"tiU morning,\" Were it not that just then he detected a smUe On Mrs. Crab's features, so he thought it worth while Just to add, \" Till the morning,\" For thus it so happened : Mrs. Nicholas Crab was awoke about four, Distinctly heard his ruffianly roar. In short, he swore till his breath would allow him to swear By an unmistakable, sonorous snore, We might with propriety call it a roar, no more,"], [188, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 168 'Twas a terrible battle ; but such things must be \" At every famous victory.\" But why further proceed, There's surely no need To make the heart bleed, And bring tears to the eyes of all who may read, By tracing stiU further the tragical deed. In this heart-rending ditty, And then he swore inwardly, doubtless. Now Mrs. Nicholas heard the noise from below, But Uke a sensible woman and wife, As he entered the room, she looked up with a smUe, And at breakfast she chatted and talked all the while, As if she had heard not one word of revile, Or even a sound of the strife. Aal marveUous, wonderful, strange, but true, _. He really got through His coffee and roll, without grumbling, too. But a tempest's preceded, alas ! by a calm, And the wound is more painful after the balm, And the darkness shows blacker after the flash, (By no means ajeu d' esprit), Don't you think Mr. Crab's to be pitied ? Don't you think he ought not to be twitted ? With being a tyrant, a brute, and abear ! Don't you think it a shame, and grossly unfair, Don't you think that his troubles are many and rare, Don't you think thai he really has \" nothing but care ?\" You may think as you please, my dear readers, but I Think such men are fit neither to Uve nor to die ; Fit neither to govern, to rule, or to hold And the night is the stiller after the crash ; So I firmly believe, as I'm a sinner, That the row]wUl \" come off,\" as the roughs say, al dinner. And marvellous realization ! The row did come off; and for mutual edification, I'll give you the facts, the words, and the acts, Of their mutual retaliation. The talents entrusted, the mercies untold. Surrounded by blessings on every hand, With every comfort that gold can command, Yet thankless, ungrateful for mercies bestowed By the bountiful hand of a merciful God. 'Twould teach such a lesson, I think, to repair To the haunts of the poor, who have \" nothing but care,\" And witness the horrors of poverty there ; Surrounded by vice, untaught, and unfed, Unclothed, and uneared for \u2014 no firing, or bed. The tables were spread with every dish That the strictest of epicures surely could wish \u2014 Soups, patties, and entries of every description, With French names as long as a church-rate subscription. But to give you the items composing the dishes, Would puzzle one weU up in \" birds, beasts, and fishes.\" Yet old Crab looked around, Not a dish could be found, To suit so capricious a taste. He turned up his nose at pattie and paste\u2014 This was not done, and that was a waste, \" Do try this Southdown, 'tis capital, love.\" If Mrs. Crab had been as wise as the serpent, And mild as the dove, She could not, just then, have averted the strife, For old Crab had resolved to war ivith his wife. Or visit the hospital, watch by the side Of the sufferer, patient, though sorely tried \u2014 By the loss of that wealth \u2014 The richest of all \u2014 the sweet blessing of health j From-such scenes and sorrows surely no man would dare To utter the requiem, \" Nothing but care.\" Now, ladies and gentlemen, since we intend With amusfeme'rit and fun some instruction to blend, To husbands, this evening, one word would I say, To passion and grumbUng never give way. To wives but a hint, it requires much tact He arose in a rage ; No tiger in cage u , Could eclipse him in rage. Ma am there's nothing done right, from morning tUl night. There's nothing done that should be done, And if it's done at all, ma'am. It better never had been done, Than done so very ill, ma'am. Silence, ma'am, not one word.\" But Mrs. Crab would be heard To know how far to go, and when to retract. To ladies intending to marry, look, Lest in fishing, you catch but a crab on your hook. And to aU, young and old, this advice we would give\u2014 \u25a0 Be thankful for mercies, and \"Uve whUe you Uve,\" Nor repine at a trifle, or mourn at a loss, But remember the proverb, \" No crown if no cross.\" Submissive and trustful, let this be our prayer \u2014 Lord, sanctify to us our measure of care. This time, at least. She took up her station, Her eyes they shot fire, her cheeks were carnation, Aud, in double shrill notes she commenced her oration : \u2014 \" How dare you to act as you've acted this day; How dare you to talk in this scandalous way. You're a tyrannical despot\u2014 a monster, sir. Pray Who do you think you are ? Oh ! you shan't sneak away; You have roused my temper, and now you shaU stay And hear me, and I wUl have my say. You're a tiger, a wretch, a brute, and a bear, A demon, a viUain, a hypocrite. There ! I've spoken my mind, and now I don't care.\" TAMING OF THE SHREW. Thus have I poUtically begun my reign, And 'tis my hope to end successfully : My falcon now is sharp, and passing empty : And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorg'd, For then she never looks upon her lure. Another way I have to man my haggard, To make her come, and know her keeper's call, That i3, to watch her, as we watch these kites, That bate, and beat, aud will not be obedient. She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat ; Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shaU not j As with the meat, some undeserved fault I'U find about the making of the bed ; And here I'U fling the pillow, thei-d the bolster, This way the coverlet, another way the sheets .\u2014 Ay, and amid this burly, I intend, That is all done in reverend care of her ; And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night ; And, if she chance to nod, I'll rail and brawl, And with the clamour keep her still awake. This is a way to kill a wife ivith kindness : And thus I'U curb her mad and headstrong humour :\u2014 He that knows better how to tame a shrew, Now let him speak ; 'tis charity to show. Here Mr. Crab chimed in. Then followed a scene : Helter, skelter, pelter, Hurry, skurry, flurry, Hither, thither, whither, Sighing, flying, crying, Retaliation, recrimination, Quite in rotation, Without peroration, Such an oration, Such an ovation, If I gave but the details 'twould startle the nation. Suffice it to say, Mrs. Crab won the day."], [189, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 169 TO A SKYLARK. I have never heard, Praise of love or wine That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.

If they answer not\u2014 The buried prophet answered to the hag Of Endor; and the Spartan monarch drew From the Byzantine maid's unsleeping spirit An answer and his destiny \u2014 ho slew, That which he loved, unknowing what he slew, And died unpardon'd \u2014 though he caU'd in aid The Phyxian Jove, and in Phigalia roused The Arcadian Evocators to compel The indignant shadow to depose her wrath, Or fix her term of vengeance\u2014 she replied In words of dubious import, but fulfill' d.

Tho other young gay spirits talk and shout In tones that come like songs of morning birds : Or, pressed by chUdish grief, they wail and pout, And pour their anguish forth in sobbing words.

Oh ! thou art dear to me beyond all others, And when I breathe my trust and bend my knee, For blessings on thy sisters and thy brothers, God seems the nighest when I pray for thee.

I LOVE the sunshine everywhere, In wood, and field, and glen ; I love it in the busy haunts Of town-imprisoned men. MY NATIVE VALE. I love it when it streameth in The humble cottage door, And casts the chequered casement shade Upon the red-brick floor. Dear is my little native vale, The ring-dove buUds and murmurs there a Close to my cot she tells her tale, To every passing vUlager. The squirrel leaps from tree to tree, And shells his nuts at Uberty. I love it where the children Ue Deep in the clovery grass, To watch among the twining roots The gold-green beetles pass. In orange groves and myrtle bowers, That breathe a gale of fragrance round, I charm the fairy footed hours, With my loved lute's romantic sound ; Or crowns of Uving laurel weave, For those that win the race at eve. I love it on the breezy sea, To glance on sail aud oar, WhUe the great waves, Uke molten glass, Come leaping to the shore. I love it on the mountain-tops, Where Ues the thawless snow, And half a kingdom, bathed in light, Lies stretching out below. The shepherd's horn at break of day, The ballet danced in twUight glade, The canzonet and roundelay, Sung in the sUent green-wood shade, These simple joys that never fail, ShaU bind me to ray native vale. And when it shines in forest-glades, Hidden, and green, and cool, Through mossy boughs and veined leaves, How is it beautiful ! JAFFAR.

Jappar, the Barmecide, the good vizier, The poor man's hope, the friend without a peer \u2014 Jaffar was dead, slain by a doom unjust ; And guUty Haroun, suUen with mistrust, Of what the good and e'en the bad might say, Ordained that no man living, from that day, Should dare to speak his name on pain of death : All Araby and Persia held their breath \u2014 All but the brave Mondeer.

Soft musical numbers were heard all around, A BOAT RACE\u2014 AND WRECK. One gusty day, now stormy and now still, I stood apart upon the western hill, And saw a race at sea : a gun was heard, And two contending boats at length appeared : Equal awhUe ; then one was left behind : Aud for a moment had her chance resigned, When in that moment, up a sail they drew \u2014 Not used before \u2014 their rivals to pursue. Strong was the gale ! in hurry now there came Men from the town\u2014 their thoughts, their fears the same; And women too ! affrighted maids and wives, All deeply feeUng for their sailors' Uves. The strife continued : in a glass we saw The desperate efforts, and we stood in awe, When the last boat shot suddenly before, Then fiUed, and sank\u2014 and could be seen no more ! Then were those piercing shrieks, that frantic flight, AU hurried ! all in tumult and affright ! A gathering crowd from different streets drew near, All ask, aU answer \u2014 none attend, none hear ! One boat is safe ; and see ! she backs her sail To save the sinking\u2014 WUl her aid avaU ? Oh ! how impatient on the sands we tread, And the winds roaring and the women led, As up and down they pace with frantic air, And scorn a comforter, and witt despair ; They know not who in either boat is gone, But think the father, husband, lover, one. And who is she apart ? She dares not come The horns and the clarions echoing sound. Sweet were the strains, as odorous gales that blow O'er fragrant banks, where pinks and roses grow. The peer was quite ravished, whUe close to his side Sat Lady Bunbutter, in beautiful pride ! Oft turning his eyes, he with rapture surveyed All the powerful charms she so nobly displayed : As when at the feast of the great Alexander, Timotheus, the musical son of Thersander, Breathed heaven by measures. Oh ! had I a voice that was stronger than steel, With twice fifty tongues to express what I feel, And as many good mouths, yet I never could utter All the speeches my lord made to Lady Bunbutter ! So polite aU the time, that he ne'er touched a bit, While she ate up his rolls and applauded his wit: For they teU me that men of true taste, when they treat, Should talk a great deal, but they never should eat : And if that be the fashion, I never wiU give Any grand entertainment as long as I Uve : For I'm of opinion, 'tis proper to cheer The stomach and bowels as well as the ear.

Who has e'er been in London, that overgrown place, Has seen \" Lodgings to let,\" stare him full in the face ; Some are good, and let dearly; whUe some 'tis well known, Are so dear and so bad, they are best let alone. Will Waddle, whose temper was studious and lonely, Hired lodgings that took single gentlemen only : But Will was so fat, he appeared Uke a tun, \u2014 Or two single gentlemen roUed into one. He enter'd his rooms, and to bed he retreated ; But all the night long he felt fever'd and heated : And, though heavy to weigh, as a score of fat sheep, He was not by any means heavy to sleep. And when, Uke Chaldeans, we all had adored This beautiful image set up by my lord, Some few insignificant folk went away, Just to foUow the employments and calls of the day ; But those who knew better their time how to spend, The fiddling and dancing all chose to attend. Miss Chinch and Sir Toby performed a cotillon, Just the same as our Susan and Bob the postilion ; All the while her mamma was expressing her joy, That her daughter the morning could 60 well employ. Now, why should tho Muse, my dear mother, relate The misfortunes that fall to the lot of the great ? As homeward we come \u2014 'tis with sorrow you'U hear What a dreadful disaster attended the peer; Next night 'twas the same ! and the next ! and the next ! He perspir'd Uke an ox ; he was nervous and vex'd; Week pass'd after week, tiU by weekly succession, His weakly condition was past aU expression. In six months his acquaintance began much to doubt him ; For his skin, \" like a lady's loose gown,\" hung about him. He sent for a doctor, and cried like a ninny, \" I have lost many pounds\u2014 make me well, there's a guinea.\" The doctor look'd wise : \u2014 \" a slow fever,\" ho saidt Prescribed sudorifics, \u2014 and going to bed. \" Sudorifics in bed,\" exclaimed WiU, \" are humbugs !

Will kick'd out the doctor ; \u2014 but when ill indeed, E'en dismissing the doctor don't always succeed ; So, calling his host, \u2014 he said \u2014 \"Sir, do yoa know I'm the fat single gentleman, six months ago ? \" Look ye, landlord !

Or stooping to earth, in thy gentleness, Our darkttng path to cheer and bless ? Beautiful thing ! thou art come in love With gentle gales from the world above, Breathing of pureness, breathing of bliss, Bearing our spirits away from this, To the better thoughts, to the brighter skies, Where heaven's eternal sunshine Ues ; Winning our hearts, by a blessed guile, With that infant look and angel smile. Beautiful thing ! thou art come in joy, With the look and the voice of our darling boy \u2014 Him that was torn from the bleeding hearts He had twined about with his infant arts, Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg ; Yea, curb and woo, for leave to do him good.

Beautiful thing ! thou art come in peace, Bidding our doubts and our fears to cease ; Wiping the tears which unbidden start From that bitter fount in the broken heart, Cheering us still on our lonely way, Lest our spirits should faint, or our feet should stray Till, risen with Christ, we come to be, I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him. So, again, good night : \u2014 I must be cruel, only to be kind : Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind. \u2014 But one word more, good lady. Beautiful thing, ivith our boy and thee. Queen.

'Twere good you let him know ; For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide ? who would do so ? No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house's top, Let the birds fly; and, like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep, And break your own neck down. Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be mads of breath, And breath of life, I have no Use to breathe What thou hast said to me. The abbot arose and closed his book, And donned his sandal shoon, And wandered forth alone, to look Upon the summer moon : A starlight sky was o'er his head, A quiet breeze around ; And the flowers a thrilUng fragrance shed. And the waves a soothing sound : It was not an hour, nor a scene, for aught But love and calm deUght ; Yet the holy man had a cloud of thought On his wrinkled brow that night, He gazed on the river that gurgled by, But he thought not of the reeds ; He clasped his gUded rosary, But he did not teU the beads : If he looked up to heaven, 'twas not to invoke The spirit that dweUeth there ; If he opened his Ups, the words they spoke Had never the tone of prayer.

But ever, from that hour, 'tis said, He stammered and he stuttered, As if an axe went through his head, With every word he uttered. He stuttered o'er blessing, he stuttered o'er bar, He stuttered, drunk or dry, And none but he and the fisherman Above \u2014 below ! \u2014 Lightly and brightly they glide and go : The hungry and keen to the top are leaping, The lazy and fat in the depths are sleeping ; Fishing is fine when the pool is muddy, Broiling is rich when the coals are ruddy ! \" In a monstrous fright, by the murky light, He looked to the lest, and he looked to the right. But what was tho vision close before him, That flung such a sudden stupor o'er him ? 'Twas a sight to make his hair uprise, And the Use-blood colder run : Could tell the reason why ! IMAGINATION AND REALITY. The hill was in the sunshine gay and green, The vale below could not be seen ; A cloud hung over it, A thin white cloud, that scarce was seen to fly, So slowly did it flit ; Yet cloud methinks I err in calling it, It spread so evenly along the sky. It gave the httls beyond a hue So beautiful and blue, The startled priest struck both his thighs, , And the abbey clock struck one ! All alone, by the side of the pool, A taU man sat on a three-legged stool, Kicking his heels on the dewy sod, And putting in order his reel and rod. Red were the rags bis shoulders wore, And a high red cap on his head he bore ; His arms and his legs were long and bare ; And two or three locks of long red hair Were tossing about his scraggy neck, Like a tattered flag o'er a spUtting wreck. Pulling and tugging the fisherman sat ; When he hauled out a gentleman, fine and fat, With a nose as red as a comet. That I stood loitering for the view : Loitering and musing thoughtfuUy stood I, For well thoso hiUs I knew, And many a time had travell'd them aU o'er; Yet now such change the hazy air had wrought, That I could well have thought I never had beheld the scene before. But while I gazed, the cloud was passing by; On the slow air it slowly travell'd on, Estsoon and that deceitful haze was gone, Which had beguUed me with its mockery ; And all things seem'd again the things they were. Alas ! but then they were not half so fair \"A capital stew,\" the fisherman said, \" With cinnamon and sherry ! \" As I had shaped them in the hazy air ! THE REASON WHY. There was turning of keys, and creaking of locks, As ho took forth a bait from his iron box. A good sword and a trusty hand, A merry heart and true ; King James's men shall understand What Cornish men can do. And have they fixed the where and when P Many the cunning sportsman tried, Many he flung with a frown aside ; A minstrel's harp, and a miser's chest, A hermit's cowl, and a baron's crest, And golden cups of the brightest wine That ever was pressed from the Burgundy vine. There was a perfume of sulphur and nitre, As he came at last to a bishop's mitre ! And shall Trelawney die ? Then twenty thousand Cornish men WiU know the reason why ! What, wiU they scorn Tre, Pol, and Pen, And shaU Trelawney die ? From top to toe the abbot shook, As the fisherman armed a golden hook ; And awfully were his features wrought By some dark dream, or wakened thought. Look how the fearful. felon gazes On the scaffold his country's vengeance raises, When the Ups are cracked and the jaws are dry, With the thirst which only in death shall die. WUder far was the abbot's glance, Then twenty thousand underground WiU know the reason why !

What, wiU they scorn Tre, Pol, and Pen, And shall Trelawney die ? Then twenty thousand Cornish men WiU know the reason why ! Deeper far was the abbot's trance : Fixed as a monument, stiU as air, He bent no knee, and he breathed no prayer ; But he signed \u2014 he knew not why or how \u2014 The sign of the Cross on his clammy brow. \"Oh! oh! Oh! oh!\" The cock doth crow ; It is time for the fisher to rise and go. There was turning of keys, and creaking of locks, As he stalked away with his iron box.

Ladies and Gentlemen, \u2014 I have the honour to appear before you this evening as a deputation from that noble, benevolent, and philanthropic institution, the \"Cats' Friend Society.\" Having noticed much want of feel ing on the part of female servants and others in their treatment of cats, it has induced me to come forward and lecture on the management of these truly interesting, pecuUarly constructed, yet neglected creatures ; and if I can but induce one' thoughtless servant girl, who has hitherto been unkind, to become thoughtful, or conduce to the comfort of but one cat, or even a kitten, I shall feel myself amply rewarded for any trouble I may take. We shall open, therefore, by putting to each one present, very seriously, this question \u2014 \"Have you a cat placed under your care ? \" In the absence of chUdren, a cat is an interesting and important charge : it has its wants, its capabiUties, and its claws, and it rests with yon whether or not it shaU live in prosperity and comfort, or whether it shall drag out a miserable existence, and die at last in depression and contempt. But sure, no rigid jailer, thou Wilt a short prison walk aUow, Where summer flowers grow wild at wiU, On Marwood Chase aud ToUer-hill ; Then holly green and Uly gay 1. In regard to diet. Providence has evidently intended the horse to be the natural sustenance of the cat ; the flesh of that animal (the horse, not the cat) is rejected by the human race (if they know it), although I am credibly informed that the knacker's account with the sausage manufacturer is iufiuitely larger than with the cats' meat man ; and I can only console any individual present, who maybe peculiarly partial to this particularly savoury dish, by repeating the words of the boy when told he was devouring bow-wows, tabby cats, and horse-flesh, instead of sausages. \" Then,\" said he, \" bow-wows, tabby cats, and horse-flesh is werry nice ! \" But to the point \u2014 we came not here to advocate the claims of sausages, but the claims of cats. We were speaking of diet. Physiologists tell us the peculiar properties of the horse are suited to tho stamina, colour, and digestive organs of the feline race, and, generaUy speaking, men will take this deUcious food direct to tho residences of tho animals, unless they live out of town. Even then it is no reason why the poor creatures should be neglected \u2014 bones, refuse, and scraps of any sort often form an excellent and delicious repast. At the same time, great eare must be taken to omit all additions of salt, mustard, and pepper, as the olfactory nerves of cats are extremely sensitive and delicate. 2. As to the bedding. Too much care cannot be taken about the bedding of cats. A nice warm basket, with shavings or hay, is desirable. Ladies, what can be a more painful and distressing sight than to witness the suffer ings of a cat with a cat-arrh, or a cat-aract of the eye, the effect of cat-ching cold ; in fact, a cat-alogue of such cat astrophes might be given with cat-egorical preciseness, did time permit. I once knew a cook (now no more), so destitute of feeling, so hardened in cruelty, so vicious in disposition, so wanting in humanity, as to aUow her female cat (whom, I should mention, was at tho time in a very delicate and critical state of health) to remain the whole night on a damp mat, in a damp passage, during one of the coldest nights in the month of November. The poor cat, with her twelve kittens, was found in this deplorable condition in the morning, by a young man, who removed them to a comfortable bed, fed them with warm niilk, and left them. Mark ! that young man is now a respectable greengrocer, his eldest son is occupying the very important and responsible position of parish beadle, and the youngest boy would have had a first-class educa tion in a charity-school, but he could not get sufficient ShaU twine in guerdon of thy lay.\" The mournful youth, a space aside, To tune Matilda's harp applied ; And then a low sad descant rung, As prelude to the lay he sung.

Ladies and Gentlemen, \u2014 I have before me a letter from my most respected and revered friend, \"Jehoshaphat Phubbs, Esq.,\" of Catsby Lodge, apprising our com mittee of tho death of his favourite torn cat ; and as you will belter understand the operations of our noble society by the contents of this very interesting letter, I will, with your kind permission, read it. [He reads] \u2014 \" My dear Mr. Pithybrain, \u2014 How aro you ? When last I heard, I believe you were enjoying excellent health, but that is no reason why you should be so now. A dear friend of ours was in health then, but, alas ! such are the changes of this mortal life, it is not so with him now. A vacant seat is ever before us, a voice so loved among our family is for ever hushed ; in fact, death, that grim-faced monster, has entered our family, and borne away a dear member thereof. His name was Thomas, but in our familiarity we styled him Tom. Thomas Cat, therefore, has gone the way of all flesh. He was a dear friend of your dear wife's, and I have no doubt but that she wiU mourn over him as a dear old, faithful servant. Have the good ness to break the news as gently as possible, for fear of sad consequences. He was a gaUant old Tom, and from pre-eminence was called ' The Tom Cat,' for, although there were many Toms in the neighbourhood, he alone deserved the distinguishing appellation of ' The Tom Cat.' He seemed to aim at a higher standard, and aim ing, soared aloft above his compeers. We attended him iu his illness, which lasted a whole day, and, notwith standing we fed him with warm milk, and called in the aid of three celebrated physicians, he never ralUed ; he laid his poor old head quietly down, and, without a mur mur or a sigh, mingled with the dead. Yes, he has.gone, the gallant old Tom, the warm-hearted Tom; there he lies, cold and stiff from the tip of his taU to the very extreme end of his once sensitive nose. Not but what he had many sad and disgraceful habits, and often com mitted himself in a very culpable manner ; but let us not censure the dead, let us rather pass over his faults, in order to dweU on his more pleasing virtues.

THE BACKWOODS. \"Hark, mother \u2014 dearest mother ! to tho whistling ot the gale, It rushes past our cottage with a sad and sullen wail ; I love not so to hear it, for it fills my heart with fear \u2014 This forest with its giant trees is loneless, dark, and drear. I dare not leave our door to roam among the woodland brake ; I fear to let my tiny voice the forest echoes wake ; For all is gloomy solitude, so lonely, still, and drear; No merry playmate's voice I catch, my heavy heart to cheer ; But as I sit quite timidly, and try to pierce the gloom That hangs around the forest glades, like cypress round a tomb, I sometimes think that I can see shapes of a hideous guise, Twisting and twining round the trees, and from the earth arise : And oft in darkling twUight they their mocking vigils keep Above the ground where John and Kate and Uttle Ellen sleep. And then they seem to beckon me, and point beneath their feet, As if they in theft silent grave, your darling boy should meet.\" \" Come near to me, my Edward, come near and take thy rest, And lay thy fevered, aching head upon thy mother's breast : And think not of these weary woods, but of our native isle, Whose peaceful vales will soon recall thy merry, boyish smUe. Thy sire this night returns to us, and soon our backs we'U turn Without a sigh to this lone place we all have cause to mourn. Borne homeward o'er the heaving wave, our swiftly speed- ing sail Will breast the surge, swept onward by the joyous, whist ling gale. And soon in merry Worcestershire, by Malvern's hills of broom, You will forget this forest as among the rocks you roam, And chase the painted butterfly about the basky dells, And gather pinks and daisies, and drooping azure beUs.\" Success to our poor Tommy's fist, He was a cat so clever ; He gave the rats and mice a twist, And banish' d them for ever. \" He sleeps ; \u2014 how pallid is his brow, how beats his timid heart \u2014 Some evil dream disturbs his rest, or thu3 he would not But past is aU his fame ; he now lies alike insensible to the praise or censure of mortals.

Unbolting then the cottage door, she on the sward out- steps, When, with a wild and sudden yell, a giant form upleapt. One moment flashed before her eyes the keen and glitter- ing knife, The next its vengeful blade was plunged deep in her well of life. So swUt, so sudden, was the stroke that scarce her palsied tongue Could falter out the hasty prayer that wildly on it hung. Ere her land heart had ceased to beat, life's spark had heavenward fled, And harshly wailed the night wind o'er the living and the dead. And dashing through the choking smoke, he cleared the burning door ; And stood upon the moonlit sward, when instant to his heart Quivered with murderous fatal aim the swift and barbed dart ! And as his last sad sigh was given, the echoes backward flung The demon warwhoop of foes, that on the night air hung. Brightly arose the orb of day, upon the scene of blood, But death-like was the silence of the lone and dreary wood; Where once had stood the lowly cot, beneath the bow'ring oak, Now curled with dusk and fitful flash, a wreath of lund smoke. His ruthless hand, entwining in her locks of glossy brown, The reeking scalp with dextrous haste was torn from off the crown ; And far and near the yell arose that told the tale of blood, And died in distant echoes in the deep and sombre wood. Carolled no more the joyous song of merry boyish glee ; No more the levelled axe laid low the gnarled and lofty tree ; But like a pitying spirit wailed tho night wind round tho O'er the soft couch of Innocence, the blood-stained murderer hung ; So pure, so holy, was the sleep, he feared to do it wrong. Stayed was the hand the knife that held, till whispered, fell revenge, \" Leave not a pale-face, young or old, on Indian land to range !\" 'Tis done \u2014 'tis done ! the felon deed \u2014 another soul has scene, As moaning o'er the deed of blood, within the forest green. HOLLA'S ADDRESS TO THE PERUVIANS. My brave associates ! \u2014 partners of my toil, my feelings, and my fame ! Can Bella's words add vigour to the vir tuous energies which inspire your hearts? No! You have judged, as I have, the foulness of the crafty plea by which these bold invaders would delude you. Your gene rous spirit has compared, as mine has, the motives which, in a war like this, can animate their mind, and ours. They, by a strange frenzy driven, fight for power, for plunder, and extended rule j we \u2014 for our country, our altars, and our homes ! They follow an adventurer whom they fear, and obey a power which they hate ; we serve a monarch whom we love, a God whom we adore. Where'er they move in anger, desolation tracks their progress ; whene'er they pause in amity, affliction mourns their friendship. They boast they come but to improve our state, enlarge our minds, and free us from the yoke of error. Yes, they will give enhghtened freedom to our minds who as them selves the slaves of passion, avarice, and pride. They offer us their protection ; yes \u2014 such protection as vultures give to lambs, covering aud devouring them ! They call on us to barter all of good we have inherited and proved, for the desperate chance of something better, which they promise ! Be our plain answer this : The throne we honour is the people's choice ; the laws we reverence are our brave fathers' legacy ; the faith we follow teaches us to live in bonds of charity with all mankind, and die with the hope of bliss beyond the grave. TeU your invaders this, and tell them,, too, we seek no change, and, least of all, such change as they would bring us. fled\u2014 Again re-echoing sounds the yell, the requiem of the dead! * * * * * \" Methinks I must be near my home ; \u2014 the forest glades appear Like old familiar friends to me ; \u2014 I wish tho moon would cheer And gladden with hor welcome beam, to guido me on the way\u2014 Ah !

Paths there were many Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny, And ivy banks ; aU leading pleasantly To a wide lawn, whence one could only see Stems thronging aU around between the swell Of tuft and slanting branches : who could tell The freshness of the space of heaven above, Edged round with dark tree-tops ? through which a dove Would often beat its wings, and often too A Uttle cloud would move across the blue. INFLUENCE OP BEAUTY. A THING of beauty is a joy for ever : Its loveliness increases ; it will never Pass into nothingness ; but still wiU keep A bower quiet for us, and a sleep FuU of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing A flowery band to bind us to the earth, Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, Of aU the unhealthy and o'er-darkeu'd ways Made for our searching : yes, in spite of all, Some shape of beauty moves away the paU From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon For simple sheep ; and such are daffodils With the green world they live in ; and clear rills That for themselves a cooling covert make 'Gainst the hot season ; the mid-forest brake, Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms : And such too is the grandeur of the dooms We have imagined for the mighty dead ; AU lovely tale3 that we have heard or read : An endless fountain of immortal drink, FuU in the middle of this pleasantness There stood a marble altar, with a tress Of flowers budded newly ; and the dew Had taken fairy fantasies to strew Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve, And so the dawned light in pomp receive. For 'twas the morn : Apollo's upward fire Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre Of brightness so unsullied, that therein A melancholy spirit weU might win Oblivion, and melt out his essence fine Into the winds : rain-scented eglantine Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun ; The lark was lost in him ; cold springs had run To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass ; Man's voice was on the mountains ; and the mass Of nature's lives and wonders pulsed tenfold, To feel this sun rise and its glories old. Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. Nor do we merely feel these essences For one short hour ; no, even as the trees That whisper round a temple become soon Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon, The passion poesy, glories infinite, Haunt us till they become a cheering light Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast, That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast, They alway must be with us, or we die. Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I WiU trace the story of Endymion. The very music of the name has gone Into my being, and each pleasant scene Is growing fresh before me as the green Of our own valleys : so I wiU begin Now, while I cannot hear the city's din ; Now, while the early budders are just new, And run in mazes of the youngest hue About old forests ; while the wiUow trails Its delicate amber ; and the dairy pails Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year Grows lush in juicy stafts, I'll smoothly steer My little boat, for many quiet hours, With streams that deepen freshly into bowers. Many and many a verse I hope to write, Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white, Hide in deep herbage ; and ere yet the bees Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas, I must be near the middle of my story. Oh ! may no wintry season, bare and hoary, See it half-finish'd : but let autumn bold, With universal tinge of sober gold, Be aU about me when I make an end. And now at once, adventuresome, I send My herald thought into a wilderness : There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress My uncertain path with green, that I may speed Easily onward, through flowery and weed. THE BOWER OF BLISS, Then in the ship of heaven, Ereenia laid The waking, wondering maid ; The ship of heaven, instinct with thought, display'd Its living sail, and glides along the sky. Ou either side in wavy tide, The clouds of morn along its path divide ; The winds who swept in wild career on high, Before its presence check their charmed force ; The winds that loitering lagg'd along their course, Around the living bark enamour'd play, Swell underneath the sail, and sing before its way. That bark, in shape, was like the furrow'd shell Wherein the sea-nymphs to their parent-king, On festal day, their duteous offerings bring. Its hue ?

An angel's head, with visual eye, Through trackless space, directs its chosen way ; Nor aid of wing, nor foot, nor fin, Requires to voyage o'er the obedient sky. Smooth as the swan when not a breeze at even Disturbs the surface of the sUver stream, Through air and sunshine sails the ship of heaven. Upon the sides of Latinos was outspread A mighty forest ; for the moist earth fed So plenteously aU weed-hidden roots Into o'erhanging boughs, and precious fruits. And it had gloomy shades, sequester'd deep, Where no man went ; and if from shepherd's keep A lamb stray'd far a-down those inmost glens, Never again saw he the happy pens Recumbent there the maiden glides along On her aerial way, How swift she feels not, though the swiftest wind.

Our songsters, too, say, can we breathe of them one slight- ing word ? Their plumage dazzles not \u2014 but yet can sweeter strains be heard ? Let other feathers vaunt the dyes of deepest rainbow flush; Give me old England's nightingale, its robin, and its thrush. I'd freely rove through Tempe's vale, or scale the giant Alp, _ Where roses list the bulbul's tale, or snow-wreaths crown the scalp ; I'd pause to hear soft Venice streams plash back to boat- man's oar ; Or hearken to the western flood in wild and falling roar. I'd tread the vast of mountain range, or spot serene and flower'd; I ne'er could see too many of the wonders that are shower' d; Yet though I [stood on fairest earth, beneath the bluest heaven ; Could I forget our summer sky, our Windermere and Devon ?

Now with slow stroke and strong behold him smite The buoyaut air, and now in gentler flight, On motionless wing expanded, shoot along. I'd own a brother in the good and brave of any land, Nor would I ask his clime or creed before I gave my hand ; Let but the deeds be ever such that all the world may know; Through air and sunslrine sails the ship of heaven; Far far beneath them Ues The gross and heavy atmosphere of earth ; And with the Swerga gales, The maid of mortal birth And Uttle recks \" the place of birth,\" or colour of the brow. At every breath a new delight inhales. And now towards its port the ship of heaven, Swift as a faUing meteor, shapes its flight, Yet gently as the dews of night that gem, Aud do not bend the harebell's slenderest stem. Daughter of earth, Ereenia cried, alight ; This is thy place of rest, tho Swerga this, Lo, hero my bower of bliss !

Loud shouted all in signs of woe, \" A Muggins to the rescue, ho ! \" And poured the hissing tide : Meanwhile the Muggins fought amain, And strove and struggled all in vain.

Fair is the vernal quarter of the year ! And fair its early buddings and its blowings\u2014 But just suppose consumption's seeds appear With other sowings !

Through this chink the lover could greet her, And secrecy made their courting the sweeter, WhUe Peter kissed Thisbe, and Thisbe kissed Peter, I once had a cousin who sung, Tom, And her name shall be nameless now, But the sounds of those tones are stiU young, Tom, Though we are no longer so. 'Tis folly to dream of a bower of green When there is not a leaf on the tree, But, 'twixt singing and walking, that cousin has been \u2014 God forgive her ! \u2014 the ruin of me. For kisses, Uke softs with diminutive souls, Will manage to creep through the smallest of holes. 'Twas here that the lovers, intent upon love, Laid a nice Uttle plot To meet at a spot And now I care nought for society, Tom, And lead a most anchorite life, For I've Uved myself into sobriety, Tom, And out of the wish for a wife.

Near a mulberry tree in a neighbouring grove ; For the plan was all laid by the youth and the maid, Whose hearts it would seem were uncommonly bold ones To run off and get married in spite of the old ones. In the shadows of evening, stiU as a mouse The beautiful maiden sUpt out of the house, The mulberry tree impatient to find ; While Peter, the vigUant matrons to blind, StroUed leisurely out some minutes behind. PYRAMUS AND THISBE. This tragical tale, which they say is a true one, Is old, but the manner is wholly a new one. One Ovid, a writer of some reputation, Has told it before, in a tedious narration, In a style, to be sure, of remarkable fulness, But which nobody read on account of its dullness. Young Peter Pyramus \u2014 I call him Peter, Not for the sake of the rhyme or the metre, But merely to make the name completer; WhUe walking alone by the trysting tree, A terrible Uon As e'er you set eye on Came roaming along, quite horrid to see, And caused the young maiden in terror to fl<;e (A Uon's a creature whose regular trade is Blood \u2014 and \" a terrible thing among ladies,\") And, losing her veil as she ran from the wood, The monster bedabbled it over with bl'.od. For Peter Uved in olden times, Now Peter, arriving and seeing the vcd, All cover'd o'er And reeking with gore, Turned all of a sudden exceeding!/ pale, And in one of the worst of Pagan climes That flourish now in classic fame, Long before Either noble or boor And sat himself down to weep and to wail j For, soon as he saw the garment, poor Peter Made up his mind in very short metre, That Thisbe was dead and tba Uon had eat her. Had such a thing as a Christian name. Young Peter, then, was a \" nice young beau \" As any young lady would wish to know. In years, I ween, So, breathing a prayer, He determined to jhare He was rather green, That is to say, he was just eighteen, A trifle too short, and a shaving too lean, But as \" nice a young man \" as ever was seen, And fit to dance with a May-day Queen ! The fate of his darling t!.e loved and the lost, And so fell on his dagg'.r and gave up the ghost. Now Thisbe, returning and viewing her beau Lyine dead by the veil (which she happened to know), She guessed in a nr oment the cause of his erring, Now Peter loved a beautiful girl As ever ensnared the heart of an earl In the magical trap of an auburn curl, A little Miss Thisbe, who lived next door (They slept, in fact, on the veiy same floor, With a wall between and nothing more \u2014 Those double dwellings were common of yore). And they loved each other, the legends say, In that very beautiful bountiful way And, seising the knife Which 'jad taken his life, In less than a ]iffey was dead as a herring. MORAL.

A hundred passing years, with march sublime, Have swept beneath the silent wing of time, Since, in yon hamlet's solitary shade, Reclusely dwelt the far-famed Clifton maid. The beauteous Margaret ; for her each swain Confest in private his peculiar pain, In secret sigh'd, a victim to despair, Nor dared to hope to win the peerless fair. No more the shepherd on the blooming mead Attuned to gaiety his artless reed ; No more entwined the pansied wreath, to deck His favourite wether's unpolluted neck : But listless, by yon babbling stream reclined, He mix'd his sobbings with the passing wind, Bemoan'd his helpless love ; or, boldly bent, Far from these smihng fields a rover went, O'er distant lands, in search of ease, to roam, A self-will'd exUe from his native home. \" Oh ! why,\" replies the maid, \" my faith thus prove ? Canst thou ! ah ! canst thon, then, suspect my love ? Hear me, just God ! if from my traitorous heart, My Baseman's fond remembrance e'er shaU part, If when he haU again his native shore, He finds his Margaret true to him no more, May fiends of hell, and every power of dread, Conjoin'd, then drag me from my perjured bed, And hurl me headlong down these awful steeps, To find deserved death in yonder deeps ! \" Thus spake the maid, and from her finger drew A golden ring, and broke it quick in two ; One half she in her lovely bosom hides, The other, trembUng, to her love confides. \" This bind the vow,\" she said ; \" this mystic charm No future recantation can disarm ; Yet not to aU the maid express'd disdain ; Her Bateman loved, nor loved the youth in vain. Full oft, low whispering o'er these arching boughs, The echoing vault responded to their vows, As here, deep hidden from the glare of day, Enamour'd oft, they took their secret way. The rite vindictive does the fates involve ; No tears can move it, no regrets dissolve.\" She ceased. The death-bird gave a dismal cry, The river moan'd, the wild gale whistled by, And once again the lady of the night Behind a heavy cloud withdrew her Ught. Trembling, she view'd these portents with dismay. But gently Bateman kiss'd her fears away ; Yet stiU he felt conceal'd a secret smart, Yon bosky dingle, stiU the rustics name ; 'Twas there the blushing maid confess'd her flame : Down yon green lane they oft were seen to hie, When evening slumber'd on the western sky. That blasted yew, that mouldering walnut bare, Each bears memento of the fated pair. Still melancholy bodings fiU'd bis heart. When to the distant land the youth was sped, A lonely life the moody maiden led. StUl would she trace each dear, each weU-known walk, StUl by the moonUght to her love would talk, And fancy, a3 she paced among the trees, She heard his whispers in the dying breeze. One eve, when autumn loaded every breeze With the faUen honours of the mourning trees, The maiden waited at the accustom' d bower, And waited long beyond the appointed hour, Yet Bateman came not ; \u2014 o'er the woodland drear ; Howling portentous, did the winds career ; And bleak and dismal on the leafless woods, The fitful rains rush'd down in sullen floods ; The night was dark ; as, now and then, the gale Paused for a moment, \u2014 Margaret listen'd, pale ; But, through the covert to her anxious ear, No rustling footstep spoke her lover near. Strange fears now filled her breast \u2014 she knew not why ; She sigh'd, and Baseman's name was in each sigh. She hears a noise \u2014 'tis he \u2014 he comes at last ; \u2014 \u25a0 Alas !

Six guUty months had mark'd the false one's crime, When Bateman haU'd once more his native cUme. Sure of her constancy, elate he came, The lovely partner of his soul to claim ; Light was his heart, as up the weU-known way He bent his steps \u2014 and all his thoughts were gay. Lightly it comes, and nearer does it bound ; 'Tis Baseman's self \u2014 he springs into her arms, 'Tis he that clasps, and chides her vain alarms. \" Yet why this silence ? \u2014 I have waited long, And the cold storm has yell'd the trees among. And, now thou'rt here, my fears are fled \u2014 yet speak, Why does the salt tear moisten on thy cheek ? Say, what is wrong ? \" \u2014 Now, through a parting cloud, The pale moon peer'd from her tempestuous shroud, Aud Baseman's face was seen : \u2014 'twas deadly white, And sorrow seem'd to sicken in his sight. \" Oh ! speak, my love,\" again the maid conjured ; \" Why is thy heart in sullen woe immured ? \" He raised his head, and thrice essay'd to tell, Thrice from his lips the unfinish'd accents fell; Oh ! who can paint his agonizing throes, When on his ear the fatal news arose ! ChiU'd ivith amazement \u2014 senseless with the blow, He stood a marble monument of woe ; Till call'd to all the horrors of despair, He smote his brow, and tore his horrent hair ; Then rush'd impetuous from the dreadful spot, And sought those scenes (by memory ne'er forgot), Those scenes, the witness of their growing flame, And now Uke witnesses of Margaret's shame. 'Twas night \u2014 he sought the river's lonely shore, And traced again their former wanderings o'er. Now on the bank in sUent grief he stood, And gazed intently on the stealing flood, Death in his mien and madness in his eye, He watch'd the waters as they murmur' d by ; Bade the base murderess triumph o'er his grave- Prepared to plunge into the whelming wave : Yet stiU he stood irresolutely bent, Religion sternly stay'd his rash intent. When thus at last reluctantly he broke His boding sUence, and the maid bespoke : \" Grieve not, my love, but, ere the morn advance, I on these fields must cast my parting glance ; For three long years, by cruel fate's command, I go to languish in a foreign laud.

From these delightful fountains flow Ambrosial riUs of pleasure, There is a living spirit in the lyre, A breath of music, and a soul of fire ; It speaks a language to the world unknown, It speaks that language to the bard alone ; While warbled symphonies entrance his ears, That spirit's voice in every tone he hears ; 'Tis his the mystic meaning to rehearse, To utter oracles in glowing verse, Heroic themes from age to age prolong, And make the dead in nature Uve in song. Can man desire, can heaven bestow, A more resplendent treasure ? Adorn'd with gems so richly bright, We'll form a consteUation, Where every star, with modest Ught, ShaU gild his proper station.

Spirits that walk and waU to night, I feel, I feel that ye are near ; There is a mist upon my sight, There is a murmur in my ear ; Blush-tinted cheeks, haft smiles, and faintest sighs, That when I think thereon, my spirit cUngs And a dark, dark dread Of the loney dead And plays about its fancy, till the stings Of human neighbourhood envenom aU.

To what high fane ? \u2014 Ah ! see her hovering feet, Morebluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose From out her cradle sheU.

Ye hover o'er the hoary trees, And the old oaks stand bereft and bare Ye hover o'er the moonUght seas, And the taU masts rot in the prison'd air; Ye gaze on the gate Of earthly state, 'Tis blue and over-spangled with a mUUon Of Uttle eye3, as though thou wert to shed, Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed, Handfuls of daisies.

Awaking from his light repose, The angel whispered to the rose\u2014 \u25a0 \" Oh ! fondest object of my care, StiU fairest found where all are fair, For the sweet shade thou giv'st to me, Ask what thou wUt \u2014 'tis granted thee.\" \" Then,\" said the rose, with deepen'd glow, \" On me another grace bestow.\" The spirit paused in sUent thought\u2014 What grace was there that flower had not ? 'Twas but a moment \u2014 o'er the rose, A veU of moss the angel throws ; - And, robed in nature's simplest weed, Could there a flower that rose exceed. Where do ye dweU, In heaven or heU, And why do ye wander on earth again ? TeU me where and how ye died \u2014 FeU ye in darkness or feU ye in day ? On lorn hiU-side, or roaring tide, In gorgeous feast or rushing fray ? By bowl or blow, From friend or foe, Hurried your angry soul away ? Mute ye come, and mute ye pass, Your tale untold, your shrift unshriven ; But ye have bUghted the pale grass, And scared the ghastly stars from heaven ; And guUt hath known Your voiceless moan, And felt that the blood is unforgiven 1 \"PLEASE TO RING THE BELL.\" Alas ! what pity 'tis that regularity Like Isaac Shove's is such a rarity.

[A man on his trial for murder in New York was success- fully defended by his counsel in the following grandiloquent speech.] A worthy squire, not many mUes from town, Had scarce one morn to breakfast sat him down, With a fond spouse so lovely by his side, Ere she began, and smiling as she spake, \"My dear, I have a strange request to make, Yet truly hope I may not be denied. \" Gentlemen of the Jury, ' Thou shalt not ldU.' Now, if you hang my cUent, you transgress the command as slick as grease, and as plump as a goose's egg in a loafer's face.

Gentlemen, 1 do not deny the fact of my cHent having killed a man \u2014 no such thing, gentlemen ; you may bring the prisoner in guilty, the hangman may do his duty \u2014 but wiU that excuse you ?

With heart elate, Tom sedulously strived, And ere th' ensuing Sunday had arrived, Some little information he had gain'd. \" Gentlemen, beware of committing murder !

Yet whUe I speak, the dream is gone, Borne on the wild bird's wing ; And still I stand \u2014 how proudly lone, A captive \u2014 once a King ! Sweep on ! Sweep on !

But whatever you do, hold on to the strings, Remember the rule of the Jehu-tribe is \u2014 Full oft the sun of glory rose, As if it shone for me ; Yet, like day's orb, it mocked my throes, And ever sank in thee.

Of whip and shout there was no lack. Crack \u2014 whack, Whack \u2014 crack, Resounded along each horse's back.

No matter whether weal or woe appear, Thou still can'st soothe, and dry the mourner's tear ; Or when with mirth aud wit at once combined, Excite with laughter aud refresh the mind \u2014 Or when heroic deeds our feeUngs start, They thrill the soul and elevate the heart;\u2014 Or when the tender tales of love are told, Our thoughts are cast in beauty's briUiant mould : And when the poet revels in a dream To give the world his own impassioned theme, Then is the mind conveyed through halcyon ways, Where love and hope reflect ethereal rays. Hail ! Poesy ! to thee I weave my verse, A simple song, wherein my thoughts rehearse Each feeUng which hath- long pervaded o'er The spirit of my mind \u2014 unheard before \u2014 And consecrate with unpretending lays, In humble rhyme, the poet's meed of praise ; For I have dearly lov'd their heavenly dower, Imbibed their sentiments from boyhood's hour; Though not of them, my verse doth freely tell The foremost feelings that within me dwell ; Thus to the poet's worth I tune my lyre\u2014 Not to their proud pre-eminence aspire. HaU !

For when affliction lacerates the heart, Congenial feelings make our cares depart, And almost love, in every mood of mind, To study works of Poesy refined ; Let worlds decay, or nations rise and faU, His own great monument survives them all t Around the poet's name his works divine Create a stainless and immortal shrine \u2014 So shall inspired thought, which God has given, Exist for ever in the light of heaven.

Come into the garden, Maud, For the black bat, night, has flown ; Come into the garden, Maud, I am here at the gate alone ; Aud the woodbine spices are wafted abroad, And the musk of the roses blows. For a breeze of morning moves, And the planet of love is on high, Beginning to faint in the Ught that she loves, On a bed of daffodil sky, To faint in the Ught of the sun she loves, To faint in his light, and to die.

Lov'd in all time to every soul appears, The poet's eloquence of smiles and tears ; And he, whose heavenly verse, in heavenly tone, Strikes on the world, erects a kingly throne ; His subjects, all mankind\u2014 his crown of fame\u2014 And myriads vow aUegiance to his name.

Once more in aster years ; And, as she passed me in the street, I scarce could look for tears.

Then most I thought of one still eve, Of one sweet morn, how sped, And how we parted ; weU-a-day ! What might I not have said ? In vain some martyr few their veins may bleed, Their blood, alas ! can ne'er redeem or save, While heartless foes, with unrelenting greed, Tlunder at first, then manacle the brave, Whose Umbs the while disdain the bondage of the slave.

Shall they fall beneath the foe, Shall strong drink lay thousands low ? WiU you stand unmoved, and see England that is called the free ! Bending 'neath a tyrant's sway, Grovelling low from day to day ? Will you, can you, let them go ? Speak ! and sweU the mighty No !

Tim asked her the cause\u2014\" Oh ! nothing, my dear.\" Tim look'd very cross\u2014 \"'Tis something, I fear.\" \"Oh ! weU, never mind, don't bother me, Tim!\" But Tim he kicked up the deuce of a din.

She'd a husband, kind and dear, Sons who hoped a bright career ; But this tyrant made them slaves, Now they fill ignoble graves ! She was sorely distressed And anuoy'd by a gent in the town, who was dressed In a coat with gold lace, Called himself Major Grace, And wore whiskers and hair all over his fa\u0153.

How swiftly time now seems to have fled, Tho' once I thought him slow ; And oh ! what numbers of friends are dead, Since \u2014 sixty years ago. He turned him to his comrades, His dark eye blazed with light, As a meteor flashes over heaven In the stillness of the night. His whole soul seemed to kindle up With the fire of other years : Aud he spake as speaks a monarch To his kuightly warrior peers.

Without any romance, or raptures, or sighs, Without any tears in Miss Flora's blue eyes; Or blushes, or transports, or such silly actions, It was one of the quietest business transactions ; With a very small sprinkUng of sentiment, if any, And a very large diamond imported by Tiffany.

It's my fancy, there's nothing could strike it As more comme il faut \" \" Yes, but, dear me, that lean She claimed, as a sort of parenthesis, And by way of putting me quite at my ease, \" You know I'm to polka as much as I please, And flirt when I like \u2014 now stop, don't you speak \u2014 And you must not come here more than twice in the week, Or talk to me either at party or ball, But always be ready to come when I call ; Sophronia Stuckup has got one just like it, And I won't appear dressed Uke a chit of sixteen; \" \" Then that splendid purple, that sweet Mazarine ; That superb point d'aguille, that imperial green, That zephyr-like tarleton, that rich grenadine \" \u2014 \" Not one of all which is fit to be seen,\" Said the lady, becoming excited and flushed. \" Then wear,\" I exclaimed, in a tone which quite crushed Opposition, \" that gorgeous toilette which you sported In Paris last spring, at tho grand j resentation, So don't prose to me about duty and stuff, If we don't break this off, there will be time enough For that sort of thing ; but the bargain must be That, as long as 1 choose, I'm perfectly free ;"], [243, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 223 When you quite turned the head of the head of the nation And by all the grand court were so very much courted.\" The end of the nose was portentously turned up, And both the bright eyes shot forth indignation, As she burst upon me with the fierce exclamation, \" I have worn it three times at the least calculation, And that, and the most of my dresses, are ripped up !\" Here I ripped out something, perhaps rather rash, Quite innocent, though ; but, to use an expression More striking than classic, it \" settled my hash.\" And a suffering family, whose case exhibits The most pressing need of real ermine tippets ; One deserving young lady almost uuablo To survive for the want of a new Russian sable; Another confined to tho house, when it's windier Than usual, because her shawl isn't India. Still another, whose tortures have been most terrific Ever since the sad loss of the steamer Pacific ; In which were mgulfed, not friend or relation (For whose fate she might perhaps have found consolation, Or boras it, at least, with serene resignation), But the choicest assortment of French sleeves and collars Ever sent out from Paris, worth thousands of dollars ; And all, as to style, most recherche and rare, The want of which leaves her with nothing to wear, And renders her life so drear and dyspeptic That she's quite a recluse, and almost a sceptic ; For she touchingly says that this sort of grief Cannot find in religion the slightest relief, And Philosophy has not a maxim to spare For the victims of such overwhelming despair. And proved very soon the last act of our session. \" Fiddlesticks, is it, sir ? I wonder the ceiling Doesn't fall down and crush you. Oh ! you men have no feeling !

Pray, what do you know of a woman's necessities ? I have told you and shown you I've nothing to wear, And it's perfectly plain you not only don't care, But you do not believe me,\" (here the nose went still higher), \" I suppose if you dared, you would call me a liar. Our engagement is ended, sir \u2014 yes, on the spot ; You're a brute, and a monster, and \u2014 I don't know what.\" I mildly suggested the words \u2014 Hottentot. Oh ! ladies, dear ladies, the next sunny day Please trundle your hoops just out of Broadway, From its whirl and its hustle, its fashion and pride, And the temples of trade which tower on each side, To the allies and lanes, where misfortune and guilt Their children have gathered, their city have built; Where hunger and vice, like twin beasts of prey, Have hunted their victims to gloom aud despair ; Raise the rich, dainty dress, and the fine broidered skirt, Pick your deheate way through the dampness and dirt, Grope through the dark dens, climb the ricketty stair To the garret, where wretches, the young and the old, Half -starved and half-naked, lie crouched from the cold. See those skeleton Umbs, those frost-bitten feet, All bleeding and bruised by the stones of the street; Hear the sharp cry of childhood, the deep groans that swell Pickpocket, and cannibal, Tartar and thief, As gentle expletives which might give relief. But this only proved as \u00abpark to the powder, And the storm I had raised came faster and louder; It blew, and it rained, thundertrd, lightened, and hailed Interjections, verbs, proucans, till language quite failed, To express the abusive ; ind then its arrears Were brought up all at once by a torrent of tears ; And my last faint, despairing attempt at an obs- Ervation was lost in a tempest of sobs. Well, I felt for the lady, and felt for my hat, too. Improvised on the crown of the latter a tattoo, From the poor dying creature who writhes on the floor; Hear the curses that sound like the echoes of hell. In lieu of expressing the feelings which lay Quite too deep for words, as Wordsworth would say ; Then, without going through the form of a bow, Found myself in the entry \u2014 I hardly knew how \u2014 On door-step and sidewalk, past lamp-post and square, At home and upstairs in my own easy chair ; Poked my feet into sUppers, my fire into blaze, And said to myself, as I lit my cigar, Supposing a man had the wealth of the Czar Of the Russias to boot, for the rest of his days, On the whole, do you think he would have much to spare, If he married a woman with nothing to wear ? As you sicken and shudder and fly from the door! Then home to your wardrobes, and say, if you dare- Spoiled children of fashion \u2014 you've nothing to wear! And, oh ! if perchance there should be a sphere, Where all is made right which so puzzles us here, Where the glare and the glitter, and tinsel of timo Fade and die in the light of that region sublime, Where the soul, disenchanted of flesh and of sense, Unscreened by its trappings, aud shows, and pretence. Must be clothed for the life and the service above With purity, truth, faith, meekness, and love ; Oh ! daughters of earth ! foolish virgins, beware ! Lest in that upper realm you have nothing to wear i Since that night, taking pains that it should not be bruited Abroad in society, I've instituted A course of inquiry, extensivp n^d thorough, On this vital subject ; and find, to my horror, That the fair Flora's case is by no means surprising, But that there exists the greatest distress In our female community, solely arising POLYPHEMUS AND ULYSSES. A very remarkable history this is, Of one Polyphemus and Mr. Ulysses; The latter a hero accomplished and bold, The former a knave, and a fright to behold\u2014 A horrid big giant who lived in a den, And dined every day on a couple of men, Ate a woman for breakfast, and (dreadful to see) Had a nice little baby served up for his tea. Indeed, if there's truth in the sprightly narration Of Homer, a poet of some reputation, Or VirgU, a writer but little inferior, And in some thiugs, perhaps, the other's superior, Polyphemus was truly a terrible creature, In manners and morals, in form and in feature; For law and religion he cared not a copper, And, in short, led a life that was very improper. From this unsupplied destitution of dress, Whose unfortunate victims are fiUing the air With the pitiful wail of \" Nothing to wear.\" Researches in some of the \"Upper Ten\" districts Reveal the most painful and startling statistics, Of which let me only mention a few : In one single house, on the Fifth Avenue, Three young ladies were found, all below twenty-two, Who have been three whole weeks without anything new In the way of flounced silks, and thus left in the lurch, Are unable to go to ball, concert, or church. In another large mansion near the same place, Was found a deplorable, heart-rending case Of entire destitution of Brussels point-lace. In a neighbouring block there was found, in three calls, Total want, long-continued, of camels' -hair shawls ;"], [244, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 224 While old Polyphemus, until he was dead\u2014 Which wasn't tUl many years after, 'tis said, Had a grief in his heart, and a hole in his head. What made him a very remarkable guy, Like the late Mr. Thomsom, he'd only one eye, But that was a whopper, a terrible one, \" As large,\" Virgil says, \" as the disk of the sun, A brilUant, but rather extravagant figure, Which means, I suppose, that his eye was much bigger Than yours, or even the orb of your sly Old bachelor friend who's a \" wife in his eye.\" MORAL. Don't use strong drink, pray let rce advise, It's bad for the stomach and ruins the eyes, Don't impose upon sailors with land-lubber tricks, Or you'll catch it some day, like a thousand of bricks! Ulysses, the hero I've mentioned before, Was shipwrecked one day on the pestilent shore Where the Cyclops resided, along ivith their chief, Polyphemus, the terrible man-eating thief, Whose manners they copied and laws they obeyed, While driving their horrible cannibal trade. THE PUBLICAN'S NET. A publican stood by his tap-room door, Smoking his pipe of clay, With his apron white, and his shirt sleeves tight Tuck'd up to be out of the way. With a smUe on his face, and a courteous grace, With many expressions of civil regret That Ulysses had got so unpleasantly wet, With many expressions of pleasure profound That all had escaped beiug thoroughly drowned, The rascal declared he was \" fond of the brave,\" Aud invited the strangers all home to his cave. Here the cannibal king, with as little remorse As an omnibus feels for the death of a horse, Seized, crushed, and devoured a brace of the Greeks, As a Welshman would swallow a couple of leeks ; He invited his customers in ; To partake of his eheex, which consisted of beer, Rum, whisky, brandy and gin. A workman pass'd by with his tools on his back, Who was kindly invited to stay, And taste the fine ale, both bitter and pale, As 'twould help him along on his way. Then another bland smile, all tinsell'd with guile, Or a Frenchman, supplied with his usual prog, Would punish the hams of a favourite frog. Dashed and smashed against the stones, He broke their bodies and cracked their bones, Beamed forth on the publican's face ; Said the workman, \" I'll stop and just take a drop, Then run home at double quick pace.\" Minding no more their moans and their groans Than a grinder heeds his organ's tones. With purple gore the pavement swims, WhUe the giant crushes their crackling limb3 | And poor Ulysses trembled with fright At the horrid sound and horrid sight, He entered :\u2014 the gaslights were brilliant and bright, The bowl, song, and jest pass'd around ; The place had a charm \u2014 'twas social and warm, While outside the snow lay on the ground. More drink was required \u2014 'twas brought as desired, Till his senses and money were low, Trembles lest the monster grim But, when he had spent his very last cent, Was politely requested to go. Should make his \" nuts and raisins \" of him. Aud, really, since The mau was a prince, But alas ! this was more than the workman could do, He mutter'd, but sat in his chair, Then the landlord was fetch' d, who immediately stretch'd It is not very odd that his highness wince (Especially after such very strong hints) At the cannibal's manner, as being more free Out his hand \u2014 seized the man by his hair \u2014 Pull'dhim off from his seat \u2014 placed him then on his feet Than his highness at court was accustomed to see. But the crafty Greek, to the tyrant's hurt (Though he didn't deserve so fine a dessert), Took a dozen of wiue from a leather trunk, While in vain he splutter'd and swore, He was haul'd down the stair \u2014 thrust into the air \u2014 And kick'd from the publican's door. And plied the giant till he was drunk. Drunker than any one you or I kuow, And this was \" the thing,\" that, a short time before, Stood firm and erect as \" a man,\" Who buys his Rhenish with ready rhiuo, Exceedingly drunk \u2014 sepultus vino. Who meant only to take, for fellowship's sake, \" A drop \" from the publican's can. Gazing a moment upon the sleeper, Ulysses cried, \"Let's spoil his peeper! 'Twill put him, my boys, in a pretty trim, If we can manage to ' douse his gUm.' \" Now lying insane, in the pelting rain, In the cold of a winter's night, While the publican chaff' d, and his waiters laugh'd\u2014 In high glee at their victim's pUght. So, taking a spar that was lying in sight, They poked it into his \" forward light,\" And gouged away with furious spite, Ramming and jamming with all their might. Like the web of a spider, the \" Publican's Net \" Is open to catch whom it may, If you never go near, you'll have no cause for fear, But always keep danger at bay. If temptation be strong, if your journey be long, Or, if evil companions beset, If your courage should fail, then think on this tale, Beware of the \" Publican's Net! \" In vain the giant began to roar, And even swore That he never before Had met in his life such a terrible bore, They only plied the auger the more, And mocked his grief ivith the bantering cry, \" Don't talk of pain, it's all in your eye ! \" Until, alas ! for the wretched Cyclops, He gives a groan, and out his eye pops, Leaving the knave, one needn't be told, As blind as a puppy of three days old. The rest of the tale I can't tell now, Except that Ulysses got out of the row CONCEALED LOVE. She never told her love, But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud, Feed on her damask cheek : she pined in thought] And, with a green and yellow melancholy, She sat like patience on a monument, Snifting at grief.

The labouring vessel, and with deadening crash Rush madly forth to scourge its groaning sides ; Onward thy billows came, to meet and clash In a wild warfare, till the lifted tides Mingled their yesty tops, where the dark storm-elo-# rides. Centre of light and energy ! thy way Is through the unknown void ; thou hast thy throne, Morning, aud evening, and at noon of day. Far in the blue, untended and alone : Ere the first-waken'd airs of earth had blown, On thou didst march, triumphant in thy light ; Then thou didst send thy glance, which still hath flown Wide through the never-ending worlds of night, And yet thy full orb burns with flash as keen and '..right. In thee, first Ught, the bounding ocean smUes, When the quick winds uproar it in a swell, That roUs, in glittering green, around the isles, Where ever-springing fruits and blossoms dwell; Oh ! with a joy no gifted tongue can teU, I hurry o'er the waters, when the sail Swells tensely, and the Ught keel glances w Over the curling bUlow, and the gale Comes off the spicy groves to tell its winniug tale. Thy path is high in heaven ; we cannot gaze On the intense of light that girds thy car ; There is a crown of glory in thy rays, Which bears thy pure divinity afar, To mingle with the equal light of star \u2014 For thou, so vast to us, art in the whole One of the sparks of night that fire the air, And, as around thy centre planets roll, So thou, too, haat thy path around the central soul. The soul is thine : of old thou wert the power Who gave the poet life ; and I in thee Feel my heart gladden at the holy hour When thou art sinking in the sUent sea ; Or when I cUmb the height, and wand r free In thy meridian glory, for the air Sparkles and burns in thy intensity, I feel thy light within me, and I share In the full glow of soul thy spirit kindles there. Thou lookest on the earth, and then it smiles ; Thy Ught is hid, and all things droop and mourn ; Laughs the wide sea around her budding isles, When through their heaven thy changing car is borne ; Thou wheel'st away thy flight, the woods are shorn Of all their waving locks, and storms awake ; All, that was once so beautiful, is torn SONG OF THE BROOK By the wUd winds which plough the lonely lake, And, in their maddening rush, the crested movutaiiij shake. I come from haunts of coot and hern, I make a sudden saUy, And sparkle out among the fern, To bicker down a vaUey. The clouds are thine, and aU their magic hues Are pencill'd by thee ; when thou bendest low, Or comest in thy strength, thy hand imbues Their waving fold with such a perfect glow Of aU pure tints, the fairy pictures throw Shame on the proudest art ; the tender stain By thirty hills I hurry down, Or slip between the ridges ; By twenty thorps, a little town, And half a hundred bridges. Hung round the verge of heaven, that as a bow Girds the wide world, and in their blended chain All tints to the deep gold that flashes in thy train : TiU last by PhiUp's farm I flow. To join the brimming river ; For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. These are thy trophies, and thou bend'st thy arch. The sign of triumph, in a sevenfold twine, I chatter over stony ways, In little sharps and trebles ; Where the spent storm is hasting on its march, And there the glories of thy light combine, And form with perfect curve a lifted line, Striding the earth and air ; man looks, and tells How peace and mercy in its beauty shine, And how the heavenly messenger impels Her glad wings on the path, that thus in ether swell-:. I bubble into eddying bays, I babble on the pebbles. With many a curve my banks I fret, By many a field and fallow ; And many a fairy foreland set With wiUow-weed and maUow. The ocean is thy vassal ; thou dost sway His waves to thy dominion, and they go I chatter, chatter, as I flow To join the brimming river ; For men may come and men may go, Where thou, in heaven, dost guide them on their way, Rising and faUing in eternal flow; Thou lookest on the waters, and they glow But I go on for ever. They take them wings, and spring aloft in air, And change to clouds, and then, dissolving, throw Their treasures back to earth, and, rushing, tear The mountain and the vale, as proudly on they bear. I wind about, and in and out, With here a blossom sailing ; And here and there a lusty trout, And here and there a grayUng. I, too, have been upon thy rolling breast, Widest of waters ; I have seen thee Ue And here and there a foamy flake Upon me as I travel ; With many a silvery waterbreak Above the golden gravel. Calm, as an infant piUow'd in its rest On a fond mother's bosom, when the sky Not smoother, gave the deep its azure dye, TiU a new heaven was arch'd and glass'd below ; And draw them aU along, and flow To join the brimming river ; For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. And then the clouds, that, gay in sunset, fly, Cast on it such a stain, it kindled so, As in the cheek of youth the Uving roses grow. I steal by lawns and grassy plots, I BUde by hazel covers ; I move the sweet forget-me-nots I, too, have seen thee on thy surging path, When the night-tempest met thee : thou didst dash Thy white arms high in heaven, as if in wrath, Threatening the angry sky ; thy waves did lash That grow for happy lovers. 29 No. 29."], [246, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 226 i I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance, Among my skimming swallows; I make the netted sunbeam dance \" I was a Viking old !

On some fond breast the parting soul rehes ; Some pious drops the closing eye requires : Ev'n from the tomb the voice of nature cries ; Ev'n in our ashes Uve their wonted fires. Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield ; Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke : How jocund did they drive their team a-field ! How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke ! For thee who, mindful of the unhonoured dead, Dost in these lines their artless tale relate ; Let not ambition mock their useful toU, Their homely joys and destiny obscure ; H chance by lonely contemplation led, Some kindred spirit shaft inquire thy fate ; Nor grandeur hear, with a disdainful snule, The short and simple annals of the poor.

A SENSITIVE plant in a garden grew, And the young winds fed it with sUver dew, And it opened its fan-like leaves to the light, And closed them beneath the kisses of night. For each one was interpenetrated With the Ught and the odour its neighbour shed, Like young lovers whom youth and love make dear Wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere. And the spring arose on the garden fair, Like the spirit of love felt every where ; And each flower and herb on earth's dark breast Rose from the dreams of its wintry rest. But the sensitive plant; which could give small fruit Of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root. Received more thau all, it loved more than ever, Where none wanted but it, could belong to the giver; But none ever trembled and panted with bliss In the garden, the field, or the wUderness. Like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want, As the companionless sensitive plant. For the sensitive plant has no bright flower, Radiance and odour are not its dower ; It loves, even Uke Love, its deep heart is full, It desires what it has not, the beautiful ! The snowdrop, and then the violet, Arose from the ground with warm rain wet, And their breath was mixed with fresh odour, sent From the turf, Uke the voice and the instrument. The Ught winds which from unsustaining wings Shed the music of many murmurings ; The beams which dart from many a star Of the flowers whose hues they bear afar ; Then the pied wind-flowers and the tulip tall, And narcissi, the fairest among them all, Who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess, TiU they die of their own dear loveUness ; The plumed insects swift and free, Like golden boats on a sunny sea, Laden with light and odour, which pass Over the gleam of the living grass ; And the Naiad-like lily of the vale, Whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale, That the light of its tremulous bells io seen Through the pavilions of tender green ; The unseen clouds of the dew, which lie Like fire in the flowers till the sun rides high, Then wander like spirits among the spheres, Each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears ; And the hyacinth purple, and white, and blue, Which flung from its beUs a sweet peal anew Of music so delicate, soft, and intense, It was felt like an odour within the sense ; The quivering vapours of dim noontide, Which like a sea o'er the warm earth glide, In which every sound, and odour, and beam, Move as reeds in a single stream ; And the rose like a nymph to the bath address, Which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast, TUl, fold aster fold, to the fainting air The soul of her beauty and love lay bare ; Each and aU like ministering angels were For the sensitive plant sweet joy to bear, WhUst the lagging hours of the day went by Like windless clouds o'er a tender sky. And the wand-like Uly, which Ufted up, As a M\u00e6nad, its moonlight-coloured cup, TiU the fiery star, which is its eye, Crazed through clear dew on the tender sky ; And when evening descended from heaven above, And the earth was all rest, and the air was all love, And delight, tho' less bright, was far more deep, And the day's veU feU from the world of sleep. And the jessamine faint, and the sweet tuberose, The sweetest flower for scent that blows ; And all rare blossoms from every clime Grew in that garden in perfect prime. And the beasts, and the birds, and the insects were drowned In an ocean of dreams without a sound ; And on the stream whose inconstant bosom Was prankt under boughs of embowering blossom, With golden and green light, slanting through Their heaven of many a tangled hue. Whose waves never mark, tho' they never impress The Ught sand which paves it, consciousness ; (Only over head the sweet nightingale Ever sang more sweet as the day might faU, And snatches of its Elysian chant Were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plaut.) Broad water liUies lay tremulously, And starry river-buds glimmered by, And around them the soft stream did glide and dance With a motion of sweet sound and radiance. The sensitive plant was the earUest Up-gathered into the bosom of rest ; A sweet chUd weary of its deUght, The feeblest and yet the favourite, Cradled within the embrace of night. And the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss, Which led through the garden along and across, Some open at once to the sun and the breeze, Some lost among bowers of blossoming trees. Were all paved with daisies and delicate bells As fair as the fabulous asphodels ; THE ARAB'S FAREWELL TO HIS HORSE.

And wherefore slaughter'd ? wherefore, but because Such were the bloody circus' genial laws, And the imperial pleasure. \u2014 Wherefore not i What matters where we fall to fill the maws Of worms \u2014 on battle plains or listed spot ? Both are but theatres where chief actors rot. Seven daughters had Lord Archibald, All children of one mother ; I could not say in one short day What love they bore each other. A garland of se- .n lilies wrought ! Seven Sisters that together dwell ; But he, bold knight as ever fought, Their father, took of them no thought, He loved the wars so weU. Sing, mournfully, oh ! mournfully, The Solitude of Binnorie ! I see before me the Gladiator lie : He leans upon his hand \u2014 his manly brow Consents to death, but conquers agony ; And his droop'd head sinks gradually low ; And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow From the red gash, faU heavy, one by one, Like the first of a thunder shower ; and now The arena swims around him \u2014 he is gone Ere ceased the inhuman shout which haU'd the wretofc who won. Fresh blows the wind, a western wind, And from the shores of Erin, Across the wave, a rover brave To Binnorie is steering ; Right onward to the Scottish strand The gallant ship is borne ; The warriors leap upon the land, Aud hark ! the leader of the band Hath blown his bugle-horn. Sing mournfully, oh! mournfully, The SoUtude of Binnorie. He heard it, hut he heeded not \u2014 his eyes Were with his heart, and that was far away; He reck'd not of the life he lost, nor prize, But where his rude hut bv the Danube lay\u2014 There were his young barbarians all at play ; There was their Dacian mother\u2014 he, their sir\u00a9, Butcher'd to make a Roman hoUday : AU this rush'd with his blood.\u2014 ShaU he expire, Aud unavenged ?\u2014 Arise ! ye Goths, and glut your ire ! Beside a grotto of their own, With bows above them closing, The seven are laid, and in the shade They lie like fawns reposing. But now, upstarting with affright At noise of man and steed, Away they fly to left, to right \u2014 Of your fair household, fatber knight, Methinks you take small heed ! Sing mournfully, oh ! mournfully, The Solitude\" of Binnorie. SILENT ELOQUENCE. The silence often of pure innocence Persuades when speaking fails."], [261, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 241 DEATH OF KING HENRY IV. Prince Henry. I never thought to hear you speak again. K. Henry. Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought ; I stay too long for thee\u2014 I weary thee. Dost thou so hunger for my empty chair, That thou wilt needs invest thee with mine honours Before thy hour be ripe ? Oh ! foolish youth, Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee. Stay but a little ; for my cloud of dignity Is held from falling with so weak a wind, That it will quickly drop ; my day is dim. Thou'st stolen that which, after some few hours, Were thine without offence ; and, at my death, Thou hast seal'd up my expectation : Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not, And thou wilt have me die assured of it. Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts, Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart, To stab at half an hour of my life. What ! canst thou not forbsar me half an hour ? P. Hen. Oh! pardon me, my liege ! But for my tears, The moist impediments unto my speech, I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke, Ere you with grief had spoke, aud I had heard Tbe course of it so far. There is your crown ; And He that wears the crown immortally, Long guard it yours ! If I affect it more Than as your honour, and as your renown, Let me no more from this obedience rise (Which m y most true and inward duteous spirit Calleth), this prostrate and exterior bending. Heaven witness with me, when I here came in, And found no course of breath within your majesty, How cold it struck my heart ! If I do feign, Oh ! let me in my present wildness die, And never live to show the incredulous world The noble change that I have purposed ! Coming to look on you, thinking you dead (And dead almost, my liege, to think you were), I spake unto the crown as having sense, And thus upbraided it : \" The care on thee depending, Hath fed upon the body of my father : Therefore thou, best of gold, art worst of gold ; Other, less fine in carat, is more precious, Preserving life in medicine potable ; But thou, most fine, most honour'd, most renown'd, Hast eat thy bearer up.\" Thus, my most royal liege, Accusing it, I put it on my head, To try with it \u2014 as with an enemy That had before my face murder'd my fatheir \u2014 The quarrel of a true inheritor. But if it did infect my blood with joy, Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride, If any rebel or vain spirit of mine Did, with the least affection of a welcome, Give entertainment to the might of it, Let God for ever keep it from my head, And make me as the poorest vassal is, That doth with awe and terror kneel to it ! King Henry. Oh ! my son, Heaven put it in thy mind to take it hence, That thou might'st win the more thy father's love, Pleading so wisely in excuse of it. Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed ; And hear, I think, the very latest counsel That ever I shall breathe. Heaven knows, my son, By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways I met this crown ; and I myself know well How troublesome it sat npon my head. To thee it shall descend with better quiet, Better opinion, better confirmation ; For all the toil of the achievement goes With me into the earth. It seem'd in me But as an honour snatch'd with boist'rous hand, And I had many living to upbraid My gain of it by their assistances ; Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed, Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears, Thou seest, with peril I have answered : For all my reign hath heen but as a scene Acting that argument ; and now my death Changes the mode : for what in me was purckas'd, Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort, So thou the garland wear'st successively. Yet though thou stand'st more sure than I could do, Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green, And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends, Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out, By whose fell working I was first advanced, And by whose power I well might lodge a fear To be again displac'd : which to avoid I cut them off ; and had a purpose now To lead out many to the Holy Land, Lest rest and lying still might make them look Too near into my state. Therefore, my Harry, Be it thy course to busy giddy minds With foreign quarrels ; that action,\" hence borne out) May waste the memory of former days. More would I do, but my lungs are wasted so, That strength of speech is utterly denied me. How I came by the crown, oh ! God, forgive! And grant it may with thee in true peace live. Prince Henry. My gracious liege, You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me ; Then plain and right must my possession be, Which I with more than with a common pain 'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain. SUBMISSION OF KING RICHARD II. Dramatis Person\u0153\u2014 Duke op York, King Richard, and Duke of Aumerle. York. See, see, King Richard doth himself appear, As doth the blushing discontented sun, - From out the fiery portal of the east ; When he perceives the envious clouds are bent To dim his glory, and to stain the track Of his bright passage to the Occident. Yet looks he hke a king ; behold, his eyo. As bright as is the eagle's, l^titens forth Controlling majesty : Alack, alack, for woe, That any harm should stain so fair a show ! K. Rich. We are amaz'd ; and thus long have we stood To wateh the fearful bending of thy knee, Because we thought ourself thy lawful king: And if we be, how dare thy joints forget To pay their awful duty to our presence ? If we be not, show us the hand of God That hath dismiss'd us from our stewardship % For well we know, no hand of blood and bone Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre, Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp. And though you think that all, as you haye done Have torn their souls, by turning them from us, And we are barren and bereft of friends j \u2014 Yet know\u2014 my master, God omnipotent, Is mustering in his clouds, on our behalf- Armies of pestilence ; and they shall strike Your children yet unborn, and unbegot, That lift your vassal hands against my head, And threat the glory of my precious crown.

Most mighty prince, my lord Northumberland, What says King Bolingbroke ? will his majesty Give Richard leave to live tiU Richard die ? Be rush'd upon ! Thy thrice-noble cousin, Harry Bolingbroke, doth humbly kiss thy hand ; And by the honourable tomb he swears, That stands upon thy royal grandsire's bones ; And by the royalties of both your bloods, Currents that spring from one most gracious head ; And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt ; And by the worth and honour of himself, Comprising all that may be sworn or said,\u2014 His coming hither hath no further scope, Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg Enfranchisement immediate on his knees ; IMPRISONMENT OF KING RICHARD II. K. Rich. I have been studying how I may compare This prison, where I live, unto the world : And, for. because the world is populous, And here is not a creature but myself, I cannot do it; \u2014 Yet I'll hammer it out. My brain I'U prove the female to my soul ; My soul, the father : and these two beget A generation of still-breeding thoughts, And these same thoughts people this little world; In humours, Uke the people of this world, For no thought is contented. The better sort, \u2014 As thoughts of things divine, \u2014 are intermix'd With scruples, and do set the word itself Which on thy royal party granted once, His gUttering arms he will commend to rust, His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart To faithful service of your majesty. This swears he, as he is a prince, is just ; And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him. K. Rich. Northumberland, say \u2014 thus the king returns \u2014 His noble cousin is right welcome hither; Against the word : As thus,\u2014 Come, little ones; and then again, \u2014 It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a needle's eye. Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot UnUkely wonders : how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls ; And, for they cannot, die in their own pride. Thoughts tending to content, flatter themselves,\u2014 That they are not the first of fortune's slaves, Nor shall not be the last ; like sUly beggars, Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,\u2014 That many have, and others must sit there : And in this thought they find a kind of ease, Bearing their own misfortune on the back And all tho number of his fair demands Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction : With all the gracious utterance thou hast, Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends. We do debase ourself, cousin, do we not, To look so poorly, and to speak so fair ? Shall we call hack Northumberland, and send Defiance to the traitor, and so die ? Aum. No, good my lord ; let's fight with gentle words, Till time lend friends, and friends their helpful swords. K. Rich. Oh ! God ! Oh ! God ! that e'er this tongue of mine, That laid the sentence of dread banishment On yon proud man, should take it off again With words of sooth ! Oh ! that I were as great As is my grief, or lesser than my name ! Or that I could forget what I have been ! Or not remember what I must be now ! Swell'st thou, proud heart ? I'll give thee scope to beat, Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me. Of such as have before endur'd the Uke. Thus play I, in one person, many people, And none contented. Sometimes am I king ; Then treason makes me wish myself a beggar, And so I am. Then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king ; Then I am king'd again : and by-and-by, Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke, And straight am nothing. But, whate'er I am, Nor I, nor any man, but that man is, GRIEF OF KING RICHARD II. K.Rich. What must the king do now ? Must he submit? The king shall do it. Must he be depos'd ? The king shall be contented. Must he lose The name of king ? o'God's name, let it go : I'll give my jewels, for a set of beads : My gorgeous palace, for a hermitage ; My gay apparel, for an alms-man's gown ; My figur'd goblets, for a dish of wood; My sceptre, for a palmer's walking-staff; My subjects, for a pair of carved saints ; And my large kingdom for a little grave, A Uttle little grave, an obscure grave : Or I'U be buried in the king's highway, Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet May hourly trample on their sovereign's head : For on my heart they tread, now whilst I live; And, buried once, why not upou my bead ? Aumerle, thou weep'st; my tender-hearted cousin ! We'll make foul weather with despised tears ; Our sighs, aud they, shall lodge the summer corn, And make a dearth in this revolting land. Or shall we play the wantons with our woes, And make some pretty match with shedding tears? With nothing shaU be pleas'd tUl he be eas'd With being nothing. Music do I hear ? Ha ! ha ! keep time. How sour sweet music is, When time is broke, and no proportion kept ! So is it in the music of men's lives. And here have I the daintiness of ear, To check time broke in a disorder'd string ; But, for the concord of my state and time, Had not an ear to hear my true time broke. I wasted time, and now doth time waste me. For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock : My thoughts are miuutes ; and, with sighs, they jar Their watches on to mine eyes, the outward watch, Whereto my finger, like a dial's point, Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears. Now, sir, the sound, that tells what hour it is, Are clamorous groans, that strike upou my heart, Which is the bell. So sighs, aud tears, and groans, Show minutes, times, and hours ; but my time Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy, While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.

Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me ! For 'tis a sign of love ; and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this aU-hating world. But he clasped her like a lover, And he cheered her soul with love. So she strove against her weakness, Though at times her spirit sank : Shaped her heart with woman's meekness To aU duties of her rank : And a gentle consort made he, And her gentle mind was such That she grew a noble lady, And the people loved her much. But a trouble weighed upon her And perplexed her, night and morn, With the burthen of an honour THE LORD OF BURLEIGH. In her ear he whispers gayly, \" If my heart by signs can tell, Maiden, I have watched thee daily, And I think thou lov'st me weU.\" She replies in accents fainter, \" There is none I love like thee.\" He is but a landscape-painter : And a vUlage maiden she.

From deep thought himself he rouses, Unto which she was not born. Faint 6he grew, and ever fainter, As she murmured, \" Oh ! that he Were once more that landscape-painter Which did win my heart from me ! \" So she drooped and drooped before him, Fading slowly from his side : Three fair chUdren first she bore him, Then before her time she died. Weeping, weeping late and early, Walking up and pacing down, Deeply mourned the Lord of Burleigh, Burleigh-house by Stamford town. Aud he came to look upon her, And he looked at her and said, \" Bring the dress and put it on her Says to her that loves him weU, \" Let us see these handsome houses That she wore when she was wed.\" Then her people, softly treading, Bore to earth her body, drest In the dress that she was wed in, That her spirit might have rest.

What's he that wishes for more men from England t My cousin Westmoreland ? \u2014 No, my fair cousin : If we are marked to die, we are enow Parks and ordered gardens great, Ancient homes of lord and lady, Built for pleasure and for state. All he shows her makes him dearer : To do our country loss ; and, if to live, The fewer men, the greater share of honour. \u25a0 No, no, my lord ; wish not a man from England ! Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host, That he who hath no stomach to this\" fight, May straight depart : his passport shaU be made, And crowns for convoy put into his purse : Evermore she seems to gaze On that cottage growing nearer, Where they twain will spend their days. Oh ! but she will love him truly ! He shall have a cheerful home ; She wUl order all things duly, We would not die in that man's company ! This day is caUed the Feast of Crispian. He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, WiU stand a-tiptoe when this day is named, And rouse him at the name of Crispian !

Did you mind 'em ? Sir C. You know I was busy elsewhere. Lady R. There was that strange unaccountable woman, Mrs. Nightshade. She behaved so strangely to her husband\u2014 a poor, inoffensive, good-natured, good sort of a good-for-nothing kind of a man. But she so teazed him\u2014\" How could you play that card ? Ah ! you've a head, and so has a pin. You're a numskull, you know you are. Ma'am, he has the poorest head in the world ; he does not know what he is about : you know you don't. Ah ! fie, I'm ashamed of you.\" Sir C. She has served to divert you, I see. Lady R.

Give thy thoughts no tongue. Nor any unproportioned thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel ; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel : but, being in, Bear it that the opposer may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice : Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy : rich, not gaudy : For the apparel oft proclaims the man; And they in France, of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower, nor a lender be : For loan oft loses both itself and friend ; And borrowing dulU the edge of husbandry. This above all : To thine ownself be true ; Aud it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Sir C. My dear, you'd make a most exceUent actress. Lady R. Well, now, let's go to rest. But, Sir Charles, how shockingly you play'd that last rubber, when I stood looking over you. Sir C. My love, I played the truth of the game. Lady R. No, indeed, my dear, you play'd it wrong. Sir C. Pho ! nonsense. You don't understand it. Lady R. I beg your pardon, I'm allowed to play better than you. SIR CHARLES AND LADY RACKET. Lady R. Oh! La! I am quite fatigued. I can hardly move. Why don't you help me, you barbarous man ? Sir C. All conceit, my dear. I was perfectly right. Lady R. No such thing, Sir Charles, the diamond was the play. Sir C. There, take my arm. Lady R. But I won't be laugh'd at. I don't love you. Sir C. Don't you? Lady R. No. Dear me ! this glove. Why don't you help me off with my glove ? Pshaw ! you awkward thing, let it alone; you aint fit to be about me. Reach me a chair. You have no compassion for me. I am so glad to sit down. Why do you drag me to routs ? You know I hate 'em. Sir C. Pho !\u2014 pho ! Ridiculous ! The club was the card against the world. Lady R. Oh ! no, no, no. I say it was the diamond. Sir C. Madam, I say it was the club. Lady R. What do you fly into such a passion for ? Sir C. Death aud fury, do you think I don't know what I'm about ? I tell you once more the club was the judgment of it. Sir. C. Oh ! there's no existing, no breathing, unless one does as other people of fashion do. Lady R. May be so. Have it your own way. Sir C. Vexation ! You're the strangest woman that ever lived ; there's no conversing with you. Look ye here, my Lady Racket, 'tis the clearest case in the world. I'll make it plain in a moment. Lady R. Well, sir. Ha! ha! ha! Sir C. I had four cards left \u2014 a trump had led\u2014 they were six \u2014 no, no, no \u2014 they were seven, and we nine. Then, you know, the beauty of the play was to Lady R. Well, now, 'tis amazing to mo that you can't see it. Give me leave, Sir Charles: your left hand adversary had led his trump, and he had before finessed the club and roughed the diamond. Now if you had put on your diamond Lady R. But I am out of humour. I lost aU my money. Sir C. How much ? Lady R. Three hundred. Sir C.

However, as is usual in our city, They had a sort of managing committee, A board of grave responsible directors ; A secretary, good at pen and ink ; A treasurer, of course, to keep the chink, And quite an army of coUectors ! Not merely male, but female duns, Young, old, and middle-aged\u2014 of all degrees \u2014 With many of those persevering ones, Who, mite by mite, would beg a cheese. And what might be their aim P Lady R. Ha! ha! ha! Sir C. You're a vile woman, aud I'll not sleep another night under one roof with you. Lady R. As you please, sir. Sir C. Madam, it shall be as I please. I'll order my chariot this moment [Going.] I know how the cards should be played as well as any man iu England, that let me tell you. [Going.] And when your family were standing behind counters, measuring out tape, and bartering for Whitechapel needles, my ancestors \u2014 my ancestors, madam, were squandering away whole estates at cards ; whole estates, my Lady Racket. [She hums a tune.] Why, then, by all that's dear to me, I'll never never exchange another word with you, good, bad, or indifferent. Look ye, my Lady Racket, thus it stood \u2014 the trump being led, it was then my business Lady R. To play the diamond, to be sure. Sir C. I have done with you for ever, and so you may tell your father. [Bant. Lady R. What a passion the gentleman is in. Ha! ha ! ha ! I promise him I'll not give up my judgment. Re-enter Sir Charles.

To end 01 mitigate the ills of slavery, The planter's avarice, the driver's knavery ? To school the heathen negroes and enUghten 'em, To polish up and brighten 'em, Sir C. My Lady Racket.

Why, no \u2014 the simple end and aim was this \u2014 Reading a well-known proverb much amiss \u2014 To wash and whiten 'em ! Lady R. And, for that very reason, you know, the club was not the best in the house. They looked so ugly in their sable hides ; So dark, so dingy, like a grubby lot Sir C. There's no such thing as talking to you. You're a base woman. I'll part from you for ever. You may live here with your father, and admire his fantastical evergreens till you grow as fantastical yourself. I'll set out for London this instant. [Stops at the door.] The club was the best in the house. Of sooty sweeps or coUiers; and besides, However the poor elves Might wash themselves, Nobody knew if they were clean or not \u2014 On nature's fairness they were quite a blot ! Not to forget more serious complaints, That even while they joined in pious hymn, Lady R. How calm you are. Well, I'll go to bed ; will you come ? You had better. Poor Sir Charles ! [Looks and laughs, then exit.] Sir C. That ease is provoking. [Crosses to the opposite door where she went out.] I tell you the diamond was not the play, and here I take my final leave of you. [Walks back as fast as he can.] I am resolved npon it, and I know the club was the best in the house. So black they were and grim In face and limb, They looked like devils tho' they sang like saints ! The thing was undeniable. They wanted washing ! Not that slight ablution To which the skin of the white man is liable, Merely removing transient pollution, A BLACK JOB.

Friends, Romans, countrymen ! lend me your ears, I come to bury C\u00e6sar, not to praise him. The evU that men do, lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones : So let it be with C\u00e6sar ! The noble Brutus Hath told you, C\u00e6sar was ambitious \u2014 If it was so, it was a grievous fault ; And grievously hath C\u00e6sar answer'd it! Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest \u2014 (For Brutus is an honourable man ! So are they att,all honourable men)\u2014 Come I to speak in C\u00e6sar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to mo\u2014 But Brutus says he was ambitious ; And Brutus is an honourable man ! He hath brought many captives home to Romo, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill : Did this in C\u00e6sar seem ambitious ? When that the poor have cried, C\u00e6sar hath wept. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff! They that have done this deed are honourable ! What private griefs they have, alas ! I know not, That made them do it : they are wise and honourable, And will, no doubt, with reason answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts : I am no orator, as Brutus is ; But, as you know me all, a plain, blunt man, That loves his friend\u2014 and that they know full well, That gave me pubUc leave to speak of him \u2014 For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech, To stir men's blood : I only speak right on\u2014 I teU you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet C\u00e6sar's wounds, poor, poor, dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But, were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue In every wound of C\u00e6sar, that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny ! Yet Brutus says he was ambitious ; And Brutus is an honourable man ! You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse : was this ambition ? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious ; And sure he is an honourable man ! I speak, not to disprove what Brutus spoke ; But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once ; not without cause : What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him ? Oh ! judgment, thou hast fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason ! Bear with me : My heart is in the coffin there with C\u00e6sar; And I must pause tUl it come back to me !

Oh ! masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong, Who, you aU know, are honourable men ! I will not do them wrong : I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honourable men ! But here's a parchment with the seal of C\u00e6sar \u2014 I found it in his closet \u2014 'tis his will ! He was a woodman, and could fell and saw With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam Which props the hanging waU of the old chapel ; Beneath that tree, whUe yet it was a tree,' He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined With thistle -beards, and such small locks of wool As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home, And reared him at the then Lord Velez' cost. Let but the commons hear this testament \u2014 Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read \u2014 And they will go and kiss dead C\u00e6sar's wounds, And dip their napkins in his sacred blood ! Yea, beg a hair of him for memory ; And, dying, mention it within their wills, A pretty boy, but most unteachable \u2014 And so the babe grew up a pretty boy, And never learnt a prayer nor told a bead ; But knew the names of birds, and mocked their notes, And whistled, as he were a bird himself: And all the autumn 'twas his only play To gather seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them With earth and water on the stumps of trees. A friar, who sought for simples in the wood, A gray-haired man \u2014 he loved this little boy. The boy loved him, aud, when the friar taught him, He soon could write with the pen ; and from that time Lived chiefly at the convent or the castle. So he became a very learned youth. But, oh ! poor wretch, he read, and read, and read, TiU his brain turned ; and, ere his twentieth year, He had unlawful thoughts of many things : And, though he prayed, he never loved to pray With holy men, nor in a holy place ; But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet, The late Lord Velez ne'er was wearied with him. And once, as by the north side of the chapel They stood together, chained in deep discourse, The earth heaved under them with such a groan That the waU tottered, and had well-nigh fallen Bequeathing it, as a rich legacy, Unto their issue ! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle ? I remember The first time ever C\u00e6sar put it on ; 'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent \u2014 That day he overcome the Nervii ! Look ! in this place ran Cassius' dagger through ! See what a rent the envious Casca made ! Through this \u2014 the weU-beloved Brutus stabb'd! And, as he pluck'd his cursed steel away, Mark how the blood of C\u00e6sar foUow'd it ! As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd If Brutus so unkindly knock' d, or no ; For Brutus, as you know, was C\u00e6sar's angel ! Judge, oh ! ye gods, how dearly C\u00e6sar loved him !

THE CHRISTIAN MARTYR. Beside a mountain's rugged heights, A swollen river rolled ; Its banks were high, its depths were deep, Its waves were wild and bold. And swiftly onward, then, it rushed Towards the mighty main, High rose its waves with silv'ry foam, Then fell, then rose agaiu. There floated on this river's tide, A maiden fair and young, Who by a cruel hand had been Into the river flung. Her limbs were stiff, her hands were bouud Tight with a leathern thong, Her cheek was pale, her haft was loose, As still she floated on. And what became of him ? Foster-Mother. He went on shipboard With those bold voyagers who made discovery Of golden lands. Leoni's younger brother Went likewise ; and, when he returned to Spain, He told Leoni that the poor mad youth, Soon after they arrived in that new world, In spite of his dissuasion, seized a boat, And, aU alone, set sail by silent moonlight Up a great river, great as any sea, And ne'er was heard of more ; but 'tis supposed He lived and died among the savage men. Around her head a halo shono, Of glory fresh and bright, Which seemed to come from heaven above I It was a holy sight. She was a martyr fair and young, Who had refused to change The creed she had in chUdhood learnt \u2014 EMBLEMS. There is a freshness in the air, A brightness in the sky, As if a new-born sun were thero, Perhaps ye think it strange. But she had learnt to worship nim, Who reigns in heaven above, And she had perished, while yet young, To merit Jesu's love.

BRUTUS ON THE DEATH OF C\u00c6SAR. Softly along the silent sea Romans, Countrymen, and Lovers ! \u2014 Hear me for my cause ; and be silent, that you may hear. Believe mo for mine honour ; and have respect to mine honour, that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom; and awake your senses, that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of C\u00e6sar's, to him I say, that Brutus's love to C\u00e6sar was no less than his. If, then, that friend demand why Brutus rose against C\u00e6sar, this is my answer : not that I loved C\u00e6sar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather C\u00e6sar were living, and die all slaves ; than that C\u00e6sar were dead, to live all freemen ? As C\u00e6sar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was vaUant, I honour him ; but as he was ambitious, I slew him. There are tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honour for his valour, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman ? if any, speak ; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude, that would not be a Roman ? if any, speak ; for him have I offended. Who is here so vile, that will not love his country ? |if any, speak ; for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. The light-winged breezes creep, So low, so calm, so tranquiUy, They lull the waves asleep ; And, oh ! as gladly on the tide Yon lofty vessel seems to ride, As if the calmly-heaving sail Had never met a sterner gale. And in a smaU, sweet covert nigh, Her own young hands hath made, A rosy girl hath laughingly Her infant brother laid ; And made of fresh spring flowers his bed, And over him her veil hath spread, With looks as if for ever there His form should bloom as young and fair. And shall these pass away, and be A wreck of what they were ; \u2014 ShaU birds, and flowers, and earth and sea, And yon proud ship, and boy so fair, Be blasted with the tempest's rage, None ! Then none have I offended. I have done no more to C\u00e6sar than you should do to Brutus. The ques tion of his death is enrolled in the capitol ; his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy; nor his offences en forced, for which he suffered death. Or worn with poverty and age, Till all of Use and hope shaU seem A heart-deceiving, feverish dream ? Yes !\u2014 and 'tis but few years we need, With retrospective eye ; In their repeated tale to read Our own home's history : We know their end\u2014 to us, to all\u2014 They are but blossoms, and they fall ; But yet young life, the sun, the flowers Are sweet as they were always ours : Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony ; who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth ; as which of you shall not ?

TO-DAY. There was a great bustle in Bishopsgate-street Within, as they drew up, and (it being a windy day) half-a-dozen men were tacking across the road under a press of paper, bearing gigantic announcements that a public meeting would be holden at one o'clock precisely, to take into consideration the propriety of petitioning parliament in favour of the United MetropoUtan Improved Hot MuffiB and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company capital five mUlions, in five hundred thousand shares ol ten pounds each ; which sums were duly set forth in fat black figures of considerable size. Mr. Bonney elbowed his way briskly upstairs, receiving in his progress many low bows from the waiters who stood on the landings to show the way, and followed by Mr. Nickleby, dived into a suite of apartments behind the great pubUc room, in the second of which was a business-looking table, and several business-looking people. Pilgrim ! does yon mountain summit Intercept your onward way ? Do you wish to overcome it ? Sit not then in idle sorrow, Wait not for the misty morrow, But begin to-day. Warrior ! is the tumult waging ? Would you conquer in the fray ? Up, then, while the battle's raging ! There's a niche in warlike story, There's a wreath of martial glory To be won to-day. Worker ! weary and incessant, Are you tempted to delay ? Trust no future, seize the present : There's a world's work round you lying, And the years are swiftly flying, Act your part to-day. On, brave brothers ! Time rolls o'er us. On, fair sisters ! Why delay ? \" Hear ! \" cried a gentleman with a double chin, as Mr. Bonney presented himself. \" Chair, gentlemen, chair.\" The new-comers were received with universal appro bation, and Mr. Bonney bustled up to the top of the table, took off his hat, rau his fingers through his hair, and knocked a hackney-coachman's knock on tho table with a [little hammer ; whereat several gentlemen cried \" Hear ! \" and nodded slightly to each other, as much as to say, wha_ _ririted conduct that was. Just at this moment a waiter, feverish wi.- agitation, tore into the room, and throwing the door open with a crash, shouted \" Sir Matthew Pupker ! \" Duty's pathway lies before us, Let this thought dispel our sorrow, \" Better than a golden morrow Is the sunshine of to-day.\" FRANKLIN'S WHISTLE Y\\then I was a child, at seven years of age, my friends one hoUday filled my pocket with halfpence. I ran directly towards a shop where they sold toys for children ; but, being charmed with the sound of a whistle on which a boy, whom I met, was playing, I offered him all my money for it, and came home highly pleased with my whistle,, but disturbing all the family with ita noise. My brothera aud sisters, on my telling them tho bargain which I had made, told me I had given four times as much for ft as it was worth. This put me iu mind how many good things I might have bought with the rest of the money, and they laughed at me so much for my foUy that I cried with vexation, and tho reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure. This, however, was afterwards of use to me ; and the impression continued so much upon my mind that, when I have been tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I have said to myself\u2014 do not give too much for the whistle, and so I save my money. As I grew up, and observed the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for their whistles. The committee stood up and clapped their hands for joy; and while they were clapping them, in came Sir Matthew Pupker, attended by two live members of parliament, one Irish and one Scotch, all smiling and bowing, and looking so pleasant, that it seemed a perfect marvel how any man could have the heart to vote against them. Sir Matthew Pupker especially, who had a little round head with a flaxen wig on the top of it, feU into such a paroxysm of bows, that the wig threatened to be jerked off every instant. When these symptoms had in some degree subsided, the gentlemen who were on speaking terms with Sir Matthew Pupker, or the two other members, crowded round them in three little groups, near one or otter of which the gentlemen who were not on speaking terms with Sir Matthew Pupker, or tho two other members, stood lingering and smiling, and rubbing their hands, in the desperate hope of somethiug turning up which might bring them into notice. All this time, Sir Matthew Pupker and two other members were relating to their separate circles what the intentions of government were about taking up the bill, with a full account of what the government had said in a whisper the last time they dined with it, and how the govern ment had been observed to wink when it said so; from which premises they were at no loss to draw the con clusion, that if the government had one object more at heart than another, that was the welfare and advantage of the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin. and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company. Meanwhile, and pending the arrangement of the pro ceedings, and a fair division of the speechifying, tho public in tho large room were eyeing, by turns, the empty platform, and the ladies in the music-gallery. In these amusements the greater portion of them had been occupied for a couple of hours before ; and as the most agreeable diversions pall upon the taste on a too pro tracted enjoyment of them, the sterner spirits now began to hammer the floor with their boot-heels, and to express their dissatisfaction by various hoots and cries. These vocal exertions, emanating from the people who had been there longest, naturally proceeded from those who were nearest to the platform, and furthest from the policemen in attendance, who havftg no great mind to fight their When I saw any one too ambitious of court favours, sacrificing his time, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, aud, perhaps, his friends, to attain them, I have said to myself \u2014 This man gives too much for his whistle. When I saw another fond of popularity, employing himself in poUtical bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect\u2014 He pays, indeed, said I, too much for his whistle. When I met a man of pleasure sacrificing every laudable improvement of mind and fortune, to mere corporeal sensations, mistaken man, said I, you are providing pain for yourself instead of pleasure\u2014 You give too much for jour whistle. If I saw one fond of expense and show, of fine clothes, furniture, and equipage, all above his fortune, for which he contracted debts, and ended his life in prison. Alas ! eaid I, he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle. When I saw a beautiful, sweet tempered girl married to an iU-natured brute of a husband, what a pity it is, said I, that she has paid so much for a whistle. In short, I imagine, that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimate which they make of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whistles."], [275, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 255 way through the crowd, but entertaining, nevertheless, a praiseworthy desire to do something to quell the dis turbance, immediately began to drag forth by the coat taUs and collars aU the quiet people near the door ; at the same time dealing out various smart and tingling blows with their truncheons, after the manner of that ingenious actor, Mr. Punch, whose brilliant example, both in the fashion of his weapons and their use, this branch of the executive occasionally follows. Several very exciting skirmishes were in progress, when a loud shout attracted the attention even of the beUi gerents, and then there poured on to the platform, from a door at the side, a long line of gentlemen with their hats off, all looking behind them, and uttering vociferous cheers ; the cause thereof was sufficiently explained when Sir Matthew Pupker and the two other real members of parliament came to the front, amidst deafening shouts, and testified to each other in dumb motions that they had never seen such a glorious sight as that in the whole course of their public career. At length, and at last, the assembly left off shouting ; but Sir Matthew Pupker being voted into the chair, they underwent a relapse which lasted five minutes. This over, Sir Matthew Pupker went on to say what must be his feelings on that great occasion, and what must be that occasion in the eyes of the world, and what must be the intelligence of his feUow-countrymen before him, and what must be the wealth and respectability of his honour able friends behind him ; and lastly, what must 'be the importance to the wealth, the happiness, the comfort, the liberty, the very existence of a free and great people, of such an institution as the United Metropolitan Improved muffin-trading of every description; and secondly, by themselves supplying the public generally, and the poor at their own homes, with muffins of first quaUty at reduced prices. It was with this object that a bUl had been introduced into parUament by their patriotic chair man, Sir Matthew Pupker ; it was this biU that they had met to support ; it was the supporters of this bill who would confer undying brightness aud splendour upon England, under the name of the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company; he would add, with a capital of five milIions,in five hundred thousand shares often pounds each. Mr. Ralph Nickleby seconded the resolution, and another gentleman having moved that it be amended by the insertion of the words, \" and crumpet,\" after the word \"muffin,\" whenever it occurred, it was carried triumphantly; only one man in the crowd cried \"No! \" and he was promptly taken into custody, and straightway borne off. The second resolution, which recognised the expediency of immediately abolishing \" all muffin (or crumpet) sellers, all traders in muffins (or crumpets) of whatsoever descrip tion, whether male or female, boys or men, ringing hand bells or otherwise,\" was moved by a grievous gentleman of semi-clerieal appearance, who went at once into sucli deep pathetics, that he knocked the first speaker clecr.. out of the course in no time. You might have heard a pin fall \u2014 a pin ! a feather \u2014 as he described the cruelties inflicted on muffin-boys by their masters, which he very wisely urged were in themselves a sufficient reason for the establishment of that inestimable company. It seemed that the unhappy youths were nightly turned out into the wet streets at the most inclement periods of the year, to wander about in darkness and rain \u2014 or it might be hail or snow \u2014 for hours together, without shelter, food, or warmth ; and let the public never forget upon the latter point, that whUe the muffins were provided with warm clothing and blankets, the boys were wholly unprovided for, and left to their own miserable resources. The honourable gentle man related one case of a muffin-boy, who having been exposed to this inhuman and barbarous system for no less than five years, at length fell a victim to a cold in tlie head, beneath which he gradually sank until he fell into a perspiration aud recovered ; this he could vouch for, on his own authority, but he had heard (and he had no reason to doubt the fact) of a still more heart-rending and appal ling circumstance. Hehad heard of the case of an orphan muffin-boy, who, having been run over by a hackney carriage, had been removed to the hospital, had under gone the amputation of his leg below the knee, and was now actually pursuing his occupation on crutches. Fountain of justice ! were these things to last ? This was the dep. rtment of the subject that took the meeting, and this was the style of speaking to enlist their sympathies. The men shouted, the ladies wept into their pocket-handkerchiefs tUl they were moist, and waved them tUl they were dry ; the excitement was tremendous and Mr. Nickleby whispered his friend that the shares were thenceforth at a premium of five-and-twenty per cent. The resolution was, of course, carried with loud accla mations, every man holding up both hands in favour of it, as he would in his enthusiasm have held up both legs also, if he could have conveniently accomplished it. This done, the draft of the proposed petition was read at length ; and the petition said, as aU petitions do say, that the petitioners were very humble, and the petitioned very honourable, and the object very virtuous; therefore (said the petition) the bill ought to be passed into a law at once, to the everlasting honour and glory of that most honourable and glorious Commons of England in parlia. ment assembled. Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company. Mr. Bonney then presented himself to move the first resolution, and having run his right hand through his hair, and planted his left in an easy manner in his ribs, he consigned his hat to the care of the gentleman with the double chin (who acted as a species of bottle-holder to the orators generally), and said he would read to them the first resolution : \" That this meeting views with alarm and apprehension the existing state of the muffin-trade in this metropolis and its neighbourhood ; that it considers the muffin-boys, as at present constituted, wholly unde serving the confidence of the public, and that it deems the whole muffin system alike prejudicial to the health and morals of the people, and subversive of the best interests of a great commercial and mercantile com munity.\" The honourable gentleman made a speech which drew tears from the eyes of the ladies, and awakened the liveliest emotions in every individual present. He had visited the houses of the poor in the various districts of London, and had found them destitute of the shghtest vestige of a muffin, which there appeared too much reason to believe some of these indigent persons did not tasto from year's end to year's end. He had found that among muffin-sellers there existed drunkenness, debauchery, and profligacy, which he attributed to the debasing nature of their employment as at present exer cised : he had found the same vices among the poorer class of people who ought to be muffin consumers, and this he attributed to the despair engendered by their being placed beyond the reach of that nutritious article, which drove them to seek a false stimulant in intoxicating liquors. He would undertake to prove before a committee of the House of Commons, that there existed a combi nation to keep up the price of muffins, and to give the bellman a monopoly; he would prove it by bellmen at the bar of that house ; and he would also prove that these men corresponded with each other by secret words and signs\u2014 os \" Snooks,\" \" AYalker,\" \" Ferguson,\" \" Is Murphy right ? \" and many others. It was this melan choly state of things that the company proposed to correct firstly, by prohibiting, under heavy penalties, all private Then the gentleman who had been at Crockford's aU night, and who looked something the worse about the eyes in consequence, came forward to teU his fellow-"], [276, "256 THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. countrymen what a speech he meant to make in favour of that petition whenever it should be presented, and how desperately he meant to taunt the parliament if they rejected the bill; and to inform them also, that he regretted his honourable friends had not inserted a clause rendering the purchase of muffins and crumpets com pulsory upon all classes of the community, which he \u2014 opposing all half-measures, and preferring to go the extreme animal\u2014 pledged himself to propose and divide upon in committee. After announcing this determina tion, the honourable gentleman grew jocular; and as patent-boots, lemon-coloured kid gloves, and a fur coat collar, assist jokes materially, there was immense laughter and much cheering, and moreover such a brilliant display ef ladies' pocket-handkerchiefs, as threw the grievous gen tleman quite into the shade. But hated punch and prelacy ; and so it was perhaps, He went to Leyden, where he found conventicles and schnaps. And then, of course you know what's next, \u2014 it left the Dutchman's shore With those that in the Mayflower came,\u2014 a hundred souls and more, \u2014 Along with all the furniture, to fill their new abodes, \u2014 To judge by what is still on hand, at least a hundred loads. 'Twas on a dreary winter's eve, the night wa3 closing dim, When old MUes Standish took the bowl, and silled it to the brim ; The Uttle captain stood and stirred the posset with his sword, And all his sturdy men-at-arms were ranged about the board. And when the petition had been read, and was about to be adopted, there came forward the Irish member (who was a young gentleman of ardent temperament), with such a speech as only an Irish member can make, breathing the true soul and spirit of poetry, and poured forth with such fervour, that it made one warm to look at him ; in the course whereof he told them, how he would demand the extension of that great boon to his native country ; how he would claim for her equal rights in the muffin laws as in all other laws ; and how he yet hoped to see the day when crumpets should be toasted in her lowly cabins, and muffin-bells should ringinher rich green valleys. And after him came the Scotch member, with various pleasant allusions to the probable amount of profits, which increased the good-humour that the poetry had awakened ; and all the speeches put together did exactly what they were intended to do, and established in the hearers' minds that there was no speculation so promising, or at the same time so praiseworthy, as the United MetropoUtan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company. So, the petition in favour of the biU was agreed upon, and the meeting adjourned with acclamations, and Mr. Nickleby and the other directors went to the office to lunch, as they did every day at half-past one o'clock ; and to remunerate themselves for which trouble (as the company was yet in its infancy), they only charged three guineas each man for every such attendance. He poured the fiery Hollands in, \u2014 the man that never feared, He took a long and solemn draught, and wiped his yellow beard ; And one by one the musketeers, \u2014 the men that fought and prayed, \u2014 All drank as 'twere their mother's milk, and not a man afraid. That night, affrighted from his nest, the screaming eagle flew, He heard the Pequot's ringing lvhoop, the soldier's wild haUoo ; And there the sachem learned the rule he taught to kith and kin, \" Run from the white man when you find he smells cf HoUands gin ! \" A hundred years, and fifty more, had spread their leaves and snows, A thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherub's nose; When once again the bowl was filled, but not in mirth or joy, 'Twas mingled by a mother's hand to cheer her parting boy.

A Spanish galleon brought the bar, \u2014 so runs the ancient tale; 'Tis but the fool that loves excess; \u2014 hast thou a drunken soul? 'Twas hammered by an Antwerp smith, whose arm was Uke a flaU ; Thy bane is in thy shaUow skull, not in my sUver bowl ! And now and then between the strokes, for fear his strength should fail, I love the memory of the past, \u2014 its pressed yet fragrant flowers, \u2014 The moss that clothes its broken walls,\u2014 the ivy on its towers, \u2014 He wiped his brow, and quaffed a cup of good old Flemish ale.

Then fill a fair and honest cup, and bear it straight to me ; The goblet hallows all it holds, whate'er the liquid be ; And may the cherubs on its face protect me from the sin, That dooms one to those dreadful words, \u2014 \"My dear, where have you been ? \" But, changing hands, it reached at length a Puritan divine, Who used to follow Timothy, and take a Uttle wine,"], [277, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 257 Until a knocking at the door at last Snapp'd short the silence.

Yet beautiful and bright he stood, As born to rule the storm ; A creature of heroic blood, A proud though chUdlike form ! The flames roll'd on \u2014 he would not go Without his father's word; That father, faint in death below, His voice no longer heard. He call'd aloud : \u2014 \" Say, father ! say If yet my task is done ? \" He knew not that the chieftain lay Unconscious of his son. \" Now, God be thanked,\" cried Alfred, \" that He sends To one poor man a poorer ! Want makes friends Of its own fellows, when the alien rich Fear its accusing rags, and in some ditch Huddle it blindly.

And \" \u2014 but the booming shots replied, And fast the flames rolled on. Upon his brow he felt their breath, And in his waving hair, And look'd from that lone post of death In stUl yet brave despair ! And with these words he brought the loaf which lay Alone between them and a slow decay ; All that might save them in that desert place, From the white famine that makes blank the face ; And, breaking it, gave half to the old man. And shonted but once more aloud, \" My father, must I stay ? \" WhUe o'er him fast, through sail and shroud, The wreathing fires made way ; They wrapt the ship in splendour wild, They caught the flag on high, And streamed above the gallant child Like banners in the sky.

But the bread was left ; And Alfred, of his reason nigh bereft, Rush'd out, and stared across the level fen. No human shape was there, nor trace of men ; But smooth, and void, and dark, burdening the eye, The great blank marsh answered the great blank sky. The ghostly bitterns clang'd among the reeds, And stirr'd, unseen, the ever-drowsy weeds Then came a blast of thunder sound\u2014 The boy \u2014 oh ! where was he ? Ask of the winds, that far around With fragments strewed the sea. With mast, and helm, and pennon fair, Of the morass ; but all beside was dead \u2014 And a duU stupor fell on Alfred's head. That weU had borne theft part ; He stumbled to the house \u2014 aud sleep was strong And dark upon his eyehds ; but, ere long, An angel, with a face placid and bright, FiU'd all the caverns of his brain with Ught. \" I am the pUgrim,\" said this shape. \" I cam9 To try thy heart, and found it free from blame .- Wherefore I'll make thee great above thy foes, And Uke a planet that stiU speeds and glows, Dancing along the centuries for ever.

It was about the feast of Chistmas-tide, When gentle love should tread on human pride, That Alfred, our great Saxon hero, lay Conceal'd within the Isle of Athelney. The island was a lonely spot of ground, By quaking marshes and dark bogs shut round ; A grudging piece of earth, which only bore Fang'd briars, and moss, and grasses lank and poor. Look where you would, no sight could you descry But the black fens, and the void wastes of sky, And the doll river, always loitering by. Alfred \u2014 constrain'd by fate himself to hide From the Dane's legions, thick on every side \u2014 In this bare isle, and in as bare a hut, With a few comrades and his queen, was shut. The iron winter stabb'd them with his sword ; Coarse were their robes, and meagre was theft board \u2014 Bread, and the flesh of fowls, bitter and harsh, Caught with sore travail in the reedy marsh. The vision faded, Uke a subtle bloom, As the stiU dawn was whitening all the room i And Alfred, starting up, with staring eyes, Saw his friends round him, laden with suppUes ; Who told him that the Danes had fallen back Before the vigour of a firm attack ; And that the people, gathering up their heart, Call'd loudly for their King to act his part, And take his sceptre and his throne again,\u2014 Now doubly his through wisdom born of pain. The king in this poor dwelling sat one night, Intently rending by a feeble light.

And by my love ! and by the cross ! I swear I never could have spoke The curse that sever'd nature's yoke ; But that a spirit o'er me stood, If you're the first a fault to see, Be not the first to make it known. For Use is but a passing day, No Up may tell how brief its span ; Then oh ! the Uttle time we stay, Let's speak of aU the best we can. THE APPROACH OF SPRING. The winter has passed with its frowns away, And the beautiful spring is coming ; The children are out in the field at play, And the bees round the flow'rets humming ; It seems as if spring, with her balmy breath, Hath wakened all things from their sleep of death. And fired me with the wrathful mood ; And frenzy to my heart was given, To speak the maUson of heaven. The trees, which so lately were black and bare, And by wintry blasts were shaken, They seemed as an.emblem of human care, When by fortune's smiles forsaken ; But now in their glory and pride are seen, Re-clothing their branches with robes of green. They would have cross'd themselves all mute ; They would have pray'd to burst the spell ; But, at the stamping of my foot, Each hand down powerless fell ! \"And go to Athunree ! \" I cried, \" High lift the banner of your pride ! But know that where its sheet unrolls, The weight of blood is on your souls ! Go where the havoc of your kern Shall float as high as mountain fern ! Men shall no more your mansions know ; The nettles on your earth shall grow ! Dead as the green ohUvious flood, That mantles by your walls, shall be The glory of O'Connor's blood ! The miU-stream's no more bound in icy rest, But down through the glade is pouring ; The swaUow now laves in the stream his breast, And now through the air is soaring ; That stream is hastening fast to the sea, So doth life hurry on to eternity. But dismantled again wiU the tree be found, And the birds wUl again cease singing ; The streams wiU by winter again be bound, And no more wUl the flowers be springing, Ought we not therefore to raise our breath In prayer, that prepared we may be for death. Away ! away to Athunree ! Where downward when the sun shall fall, The raven's wing shall be your pall; And not a vassal shall unlace The vizor from your dying face !\" But, though the seasons again roll by, To the wicked with speed appaUing, And we see the emblem that all must die, In the leaves which are round us falling ; A bolt that overhung our dome, Suspended till my curse was given. Soon as it pass'd these Ups of foam, Peal'd in the blood-red heaven ! As in winter we hope for the spring's bright bloom, So we hope for a heaven beyond the tomb. Dire was the look that o'er their backs The angry parting brothers threw : But now, behold ! like cataracts, Come down the hills in view. O'Connor's plumed partisans, Thrice ten Kftnagorvian clans T Were marching to theft doom : A sudden storm their plumage toss'd, A flash of lightning o'er them cross'd, And all again was gloom. THE SOLDIER'S DREAM. Our bugles sang truce ; for the night-cloud had lower'd, And the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky ; And thousands had sunk on the ground, overpower' d, The weary to sleep and the wounded to die. When reposing that night on my pallet of straw, By the wolf-scaring faggot that guarded the slain, At the dead of the night, a sweet vision I saw ; And thrice ere the morning I dreamt it again. SPEAK NO ILL. Nay, speak no ill ! \u2014 a kindly word Can never leave a sting behind, And, oh ! to breathe each tale we've heard Methought from the battle-field's dreadful array, Far, far I had roam'd on a desolate track : 'Twas autumn ; and sunshine arose on the way To the home of my fathers, that welcomed me back. I flew to the pleasant fields, traversed so oft In life's morning march, when my bosom was young ; I heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft, And knew the sweet strain that the corn-reapers sung. Is far beneath a noble mind. FuU oft a better seed is sown By choosing thus the kinder plan ; For if but Uttle good be known, StiU let us speak the best we can. Give me the heart that fain would hide \u2014 Would fain another's fault efface; How can it pleasure human pride To prove humanity but base ? No, let us reach a higher mood, A nobler estimate of man ; Be earnest in the search for good, And speak of aU the best we can. Then pledg'd we the wine-cup ; and fondly I swore, From my home and my weeping friends never to part ! My Uttle ones kiss'd me a thousand times o'er ; And my wife sobb'd aloud in her fulness of heart : \" Stay \u2014 stay with us ; rest : thou art weary and worn.\" And fain was their war-broken soldier to stay ; But sorrow return'd with the dawning of morn, And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away."], [279, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 259 THE SINKING OF THE RUSSIAN FLEET AT SEVASTOPOL.

And now, sir, Behold me at the age of twenty-five, well stocked with Latin, Greek, and mathematics, possessed of an ample fortune, but so awkward and unversed in every gentlemanlike accomplishment, thai I am pointed at by all who see me as the wealthy learned clown. At noon she hies to a cool retreat, Where bowering elms over waters meet ; She dimples the wave where the green leaves dip, As it smiUngly curls like a maiden's Up, When her tremulous bosom would hide in vain From her lover, the hope that she loves again. I have lately purchased an estate in the country, which abounds in what is caUed a fashionable neighbourhood ; and when you reflect on my parentage and uncouth manner, you will hardly think how much my company is courted by the surrounding famfties, especially by those who have marriageable daughters. From these gentlemen I have received famUiar calls and the most pressing invitations, and though I wished to accept theft offered friendship, I have repeatedly excused myself under the pretence of not being quite settled ; for the truth is, that when I have rode or walked, with full intent to return their several visits, my heart has failed me as I approached their gates, and I have frequently returned homeward, resolving to try again on the morrow. However, I at length determined to conquer my timidity, and three days ago accepted of an invitation to dine this day with one whose open, easy manner left me no room to doubt a cordial welcome. Sir Thomas Friendly, who lives about two mUes distant, is a baronet, with about two thousand pounds a year estate, joining to that I pur chased ; he has two sons and five daughters, all grown up, and Uving with their mother and a maiden sister of Sir Thomas's, at Friendly HaU, dependant on their father. Conscious of my unpolished gait, I have for some time past taken private lessons of a professor, who teaches \" grown gentlemen to dance,\" and though I at once found wondrous difficulty in the art he taught, my knowledge of the mathematics was of prodigious use in teaching me the equUibrium of my body, and the due adjustment of the centre of gravity to the five positions. Having now acquired the art of walking without tottering, and learned to make a bow, I boldly ventured to obey the baronet's invitation to a famUy dinner, not doubting but my new acquirements would enable me to see the ladies with tolerable intrepidity ; but, alas ! how vain are all the hopes of theory, when unsupported by habitual practice. As I approached the house a dinner-beU alarmed my feai-s lest I had spoiled the dinner by want of punctuahty. Impressed with this idea, I blushed the deepest crimson as my name was repeatedly announced by the several Uvery-servants who ushered me into the library, hardly knowing what or whom I saw. At my first entrance I summoned aft my fortitude, and made my new-learned bow to Lady Friendly. But unfortunately, in bringing back my left foot to the third position, I trod upon the gouty toe of poor Sir Thomas, who had followed close at my heels, to be the nomenclator of the famUy. The con. fusion this occasioned in me is hardly to be conceived, since none but bashful men judge of my distress, and of that description the number I believe is very small. Tho baronet's politeness by degrees dissipated my concern, and I was astonished to see how far good breeding could enable him to suppress his feeUngs, and to appear with perfect ease, after so painful an accident. The cheerfulness of her ladyship, and the famiUar chat of the young ladies, insensibly led me to throw off my reserve and sheepishness, tUl at length I ventured to join in conversation, and even to start fresh subjects. The library being richly furnished with books in elegant bindings, I conceived Sir Thomas to be a man of literature, and ventured to give my opinion concerning the several editions of the Greek classics, in which the baronets opinion exactly coincided with my own. To this suiject I was led, by observing an edition of Xenophon iu sixteen volumes, which as I had never before heard of such a thing, greatly excited my curiosity, noS I rose up to examine what it could be. Sir Thsnua saw what I was about, and, as I suppose, willing to save At eve she hangs o'er the western sky, Dark clouds for a glorious canopy, And round the skirts of their deepen'd fold She paints a border of purple and gold, Where the lingering sunbeams love to stay, When their god in his glory has passed away. She hovers around us at twilight hour, When her presence is felt with the deepest power ; She silvers the landscape, and crowds the stream With shadows that flit lfte a fairy dream ; Then wheettng her flight thro' the gladden'd air, The spirit of beauty is everywhere. DISTRESS OF A MODEST MAN. I labour under a species of distress, which I fear will at length drive me utterly from that society in which I am most ambitious to appear ; but I wiU give you a short sketch of my origin and present situation, by which you wUl be enabled to judge of my present difficulties. My father was a farmer of no great property, and with no other learning than what he had acquired at a charity school ; but my mother being dead, and I an only child, he determined to give me that advantage which he fancied would have made him happy, viz., a learned education. I was sent to a country grammar-school, and from thence to the university, with a view of qualifying for holy orders. Here, having but a smaU allowance from my father, and being naturally of a timid and bashful dispo sition, I had no opportunity of rubbing off that native awkwardness, which is the fatal cause of aU my unhappiness, and which I now begin to fear can never be amended. You must know, that in my person I am tall and thin, with a fair complexion, and light flaxen hair ; but of such extreme susceptibility of shame, that on the smallest subject of confusion, my blood aU rushes into my cheeks, and I appear a perfect full-blown rose. The con sciousness of this unhappy failing made me avoid society, and I became enamoured of a coUege life, particularly when I reflected that the uncouth manners of my father's family wore Uttle calculated to improve my outward conduct ; I therefore had resolved on living at the university and taking pupils, when two unexpected eveuts greatly altered the posture of my affairs, viz., my father's death, and the arrival of an uncle from the Indies. This uncle I had very rarely heard my father mention, and it was generally believed that he was long since dead, when he arrived in England only a week too late to close his brother's eyes. I am ashamed to confess what I believe has been often experienced by those whose educa tion has been better than their parents, that my poor father's ignorance and vulgar language had often made ne blnsh to think I was his son ; and at his death I was not inconsolable for the loss of that which I was not unfrequently ashamed to own. \u2022 My uncle was but little affected, for he had been separated from his brother more than thirty years, and in that time he had acquired a fortune which he used to brag would make a nabob happy ; in short, he had brought over with him the enormous sum of thirty thousand pounds, and upon feis he buUt his hopes of never-ending happiness. While he was planning schemes of greatness and dettghtj whether the ohange of chmate might affeot him, or what other caasa I know not, but he was snatohed from all his dreams of joy by a short Ulness, of which he died, leaving"], [283, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 263 me trouble, rose to take down the book, which made me more eager to prevent him, and hastily laying my hand on the first volume, I pulled it forcibly ; but lo ! instead of a book, a board, which by leather and gilding had been made to look Uke sixteen volumes, came tumbling down, and unluckUy pitched upon a Wedgwood inkstand on the table under it. In vain did Sir Thomas assure me there was no harm done ; I saw the ink streaming from an inlaid tablo on the Turkey carpet, and scarce knowing what I did, attempted to stop its progress with my cambric hand kerchief. In the height of this confusion we were informed that dinner was served up, and I with joy perceived that the beU, which at first so alarmed my fears, was only the half-hour dinner-bell. sprung from the table in despair, rushed out of the house, and ran home in an agony of confusion and disgrace, which the most poignant sense of guUt could not have excited. Thus, without having deviated from the path of moral rectitude, I am suffering torments like a \" gobhn damn'd.\" The lower half of me has been almost boUed, my tongue and mouth grilled, and I bear the mark of Cain upon my forehead ; yet these are but trifling considerations to the everlasting shame which I must feel whenever this adven ture shaU be mentioned ; perhaps by your assistance, when my neighbours know how much I feel on the occasion, they wiU spare a bashful man ; and, as I am just informed my poultice is ready, I trust you will excuse the haste in which I subscribe myself, \u2014 Yours, etc. In walking through the hall and suite of apartments to the dining-room, I had time to collect my scattered senses, and was desired to take my seat betwixt Lady Friendly and her eldest daughter at the table. Since the fall of the wooden Xenophon, my face had been continuaUy burning Uke a firebrand, and I was just beginning to recover myself, and to feel comfortably cool, when an un looked for accident rekindled aU my heat and blushes. Having set my plate of soup too near the edge of the table, in bowing to Miss Dinah, who politely complimented the pattern of my waistcoat, I tumbled the whole scalding contents into my lap. In spite of an immediate supply of napkins to wipe the surface of my clothes, my black breeches were not stout enough to save me from the painful effects of this sudden fomentation, and for some minutes my legs and thighs seemed stewing in a boiling cauldron ; but recoUecting how Sir Thomas had disguised his torture when I trod upon his toe, I firmly bore my pain in sUence, and sat with my lower extremities par boiled, amidst the stifled giggUng of the ladies and the servants. MATRIMONIAL MOONSHINE. Mister Bagqs was a very eccentric feUow, He was rather robust, with a oomical nose, And its rubicund tinge would lead one to suppose, He was frequently merged in the state we caU \" mellow.\" His age it was fifty, And he look'd somewhat thrifty, Though his movements were shifty, For his nervous affections were troubled with woes, And creditors \" dun \" him wherever he goes. But he says he don't care, With strange debonnair, He wiU never be done, for he's nothing to spare. He is general clerk with an eminent firm, Who carry on business, 'Midst the whirl and the whizziness Of London's great city, aft bustle and dizziness. Though he's Uttle to do But to hash and to stew, He receives a good \" screw,\" I wUl not relate the several blunders which I made during the first course, or the distress occasioned by my being desired to carve a fowl, or help to various dishes that stood near me, spilling a sauce-boat, and knocking down a salt-cellar; rather let me hasten to the second course, where fresh disasters overwhelmed me quite. Yet dear Mistress Baggs would absorb aU the browns, She became so immensely addicted to gowns ; And, not only that, but to teU 'tis a sin, She was deeply attached to both brandy and gin. But he let her indulge in her favourite whims, Expecting some day she would cripple her Umbs ; He had frequently tried to put on her a check, For he knew very weU she might soon break her naclr. And really she held him so tightly in purse, That his quarterly cash, I had a piece of rich sweet pudding on my fork, when M_B3 Louisa Friendly begged to trouble me for a pigeon that stood near me. In my haste, scarce knowing what I did, I whipped the pudding into my mouth hot as a burning coal. It was impossible to conceal my agony. My eyes were starting from theft sockets. At last, in spite of shame and resolution, I was obUged to drop the cause of torment on my plate. Sir Thomas and the ladies all compassionated my misfortune, and each advised a different appUcation. One recommended oU, another water, but all agreed that wine was best for drawing out the fire, and a glass of sherry was brought me from the sideboard, which I snatched up with eagerness ; but, oh ! how shaU I tell the sequel? Whether the butler by accident mistook, or purposely designed to drive me mad, he gave me the strongest brandy, with which I filled my mouth, already flayed and blistered. Totally unused to every kind of ardent spftits, with my tongue, throat, and palate as raw as beef, what could I do? I could not swallow it, and, clapping my hands upon my mouth, the cursed Uquor squirted through my nose and fingers Uke a fountain over aU the dishes, and I was crushed by bursts of laughter from all quarters. In vain did Sir Thomas reprimand the servants, and Lady Friendly chide her daughters, for the measure of my shame and their diversion was not yet complete. To relieve me from the intolerable state of perspiration which this accident had caused, without considering what I did, I wiped my face with that Ul-fated handkerchief, which was stiU wet from the consequences of the fall of Xenophon, and covered aU my features with streaks of ink in every direction. The baronet himself could not support this Bhock, but joined his lady in the general laugh, while I Would soon go to smash, And hence he would utter indehcate curse. And thus you wUl see, They did rarely agree, And many peculiar ways he possess' d, And at business too, He would oft cause a stew, For whenever to Jones he a letter address'd, With such a confusion his memory bless'd, To him he would send (Who perhaps was a debtor), What he to Robinson penn'd (No creditor friend), Thus Jones would receive Mister Robinson's letter. And hence would arise Much doubt and surmise, And startling surprise, To learn whom the letter reaUy was meant for, The why and the wherefore such missive was sent for. Thus in pubUc or private, The truth to arrive at, Mister Baggs was unceasingly guttty of blunders, And aU were prolific of mirth-giving wonders. But he laid all the blame upon poor Mistress Baggs. Whom he swore would reduce him to nothing but rag4-.

The merit of this prince, both in private and public Use, may with advantage be set in opposition to that of any other monaroh or citizen which the annals of any age or nation can present us. He seems, indeed, to be the complete model of that perfect character which, under the denomination of a sage or wise man, the philosophers have been fond of debneating, rather as a fiction of their imagination than in hopes of ever seeing it reduced to practice. Sahappily were all his virtues tempered together, so justly were they blended, and so powerfully did each prevent the other from exceeding its proper bounds. He knew how to concUiate tho most enterprising spirit with the most cooling moder ation ; the most obstinate perseverance with the easiest flexibility ; the most severe justice with the mildest lenity; the greatest rigour in command with the greatest affabUity in deportment ; the highest capacity and inclination for science with the most shining talents of action. His civU and niitttary virtues are almost equally the objects of our admiration, excepting only that the former, being more rare among princes, as weU as more useful, seem ohiefly to challenge our applause. Nature, also, as if desirous that so bright a production of her skill should be set in the fairest light, had bestowed on him all bodily accomplishments, vigour of Umbs, dignity of shape and air, and a plea sant, engaging, and open countenance. Fortune alone, by throwing him into that barbarous age, deprived him of historians worthy to transmit his fame to posterity ; and we wish to see him delineated in more lively colours, and with more particular strokes, that we may at least perceive some of those small specks and blemishes from which, as a man, it is impossible he could be entirely exempted. And did I leave thy loveliness to stand Again in the dull world of earthly blindness ? Pain'd with the pressure of unfriendly hands, Sick of smooth looks, argued with icy kindness r Left I for this thy shades, where nono intrude, To prison wandering thought and mar sweet solitude ? Yet I will look upon thy face again, My own romantic Bronx, and it will be A face more pleasant than the face of men Thy waves are old companions\u2014 I shall see A well-remember'd form in each old tree, And hear a voice long lov'd in thy wild minstrelsy. HOTSPUR ON THE FOP. My Uege, I deny no prisoners. But 1 remember, the fight was done, When I was dry with rage and extreme toil, Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword, Came there a certain lord ; neat, trimly dress'd ; Fresh as a bridegroom ; and his chin, new-reap'd Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest home. He was perfumed like a milliner : And 'twixt his finger and his thumb, he held A pouncet-box, which ever and anon He gave his nose. And stUl he smil'd and talk'd : And, as the soldiers bare dead bodies by, He call'd them \" untaught knaves, unmannerly, To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse Betwixt the wind and his nobUity.\" With many holy-day'and lady terms He question'd me : among the rest, demanded My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf. I, then, all smarting with my wounds, being gall'd To be so pester'd with a popinjay, Out of my grief and my impatience Answered neglectingly \u2014 I know not what \u2014 He should or should not ; for he made me mad, To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet, And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman Of guns, and drums, and wounds (Heaven save the mark !) And telling me, the sovereign' st thing on earth Was spermaceti for an inward bruise ; And that it was great pity (so it was) This villainous saltpetre should be digg'd Out of the bowels of the harmless earth, Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd So cowardly ; and but for these vile guns He would himself have been a soldier. This bald, unjointed chat of his, my lord, I answer'd indirectly as I said; And I beseech you, let not this report Come current for an accusation Betwixt my love and your high Majesty. BRONX, I sat me down upon a green banK-side, Skirting the smooth edge of a gentle river, Whose waters seem'd unwittingly to glide, Like parting friends, who linger while they sever ; Enforced to go, yet seeming still unready, Backward they wind their way in many a wistful eddy. Gray o'er my head the yellow-vested wUlow Ruffled its hoary top in the fresh breezes, Glancing in light, like spray on a green billow, Or the fine frost-work which young winter freezes, When first his power in infant pastime trying, Congeals sad autumn's tears on the dead branches lying. From rocks around hung the loose ivy dangling, And in the clefts sumach of liveliest green, Bright ising stars the- Uttle beech was spangling, The gold-cnp sorrel from his gauzy screen Shone Uke a fairy crown, enchased and beaded, Left on some morn when Ught flash'd in their eyes un- heeded. The hum-bird shook his snn-tonched wings around, The blue-finch caroU'd in the stUl retreat ; The antic squirrel caper'd on the ground, Where lichens made a carpet for his feet : Through the transparent waves the rnddy minkle Shot up in glimmering sparks his red fin's tiny twinkle. DISSOLUTION. The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself ; Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve ; And like the baseless fabrio of a vision, Leave not a wreck behind. There were dark cedars with loose mossy tresses, White-powder'd dog-trees and stiff hollies flaunting, Gaudy as rustias in their May-day dresses, Blue pelloret, from purple leaves upslanting,"], [288, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 268 For them the branches of those trees THE INDIAN'S BRIDE. Wave music in the vernal breeze ; For them, upon that dancing spray, The free bird sits and sings, And glittering insects flit about Upon delighted wings ; For them that brook, the brakes among, Murmurs its small and drowsy song ; For them the many-coloured clouds Their shapes diversify, And change at once, Uke smttes and frowns, The expression of the sky. For them, and by them, all is gay, And fresh and beautiful as they ; The images their minds receive, Their minds assimUate To outward forms, imparting thus The glory of their state. Why is that graceful female here With yon red hunter of the deer ? Of gentle mien and shape, she seems For civil halls design'd, Yet with the stately savage walks, As she wore of his kind. Look on her leafy diadem, Enrich'd with many a floral gem ; Those simple ornaments about Her candid brow, disclose The loitering spring's last violet, And summer's earliest rose ; But not a flower Ues breathing there Sweet as herself, or half so fair. Exchanging lustre with the sun, A part of day she strays \u2014 A glancing, living, human smile On nature's face she plays. Can none instruct me what are these Companions of the lofty trees ? Could aught be painted otherwise Than fair, seen through her star-bright eyes ? He, too, because she fills his sight, Each object falsely sees ; The pleasure that he has in her Makes all things seem to please. And this is love : \u2014 and it is life They lead \u2014 that Indian and his wife. Intent to blend her with his lot, Fate form'd her all that he was not ; And, as by mere unlikeness, thoughts Associate we see, Their hearts, from very difference, caught A perfect sympathy.

There's a gladness in the voice of youth, and its song 'mid summer bowers, When the sun is on its golden car, and the dew upon the flowers ; It comes like our own voices back from a past and happy scene, So fair that nothing after i3 so fair as what has been. Restrains his active stride, While she assumes a bolder gait To ramble at his side ; Thus, even as the steps they frame, Their souls fast alter to the same, The one forsakes ferocity, And momently grows mild ; The other tempers more and more The artful with the wild. There's a gladness in the look of youth, and its smilo of friendly glee, When it meets with gladness like its own, as simple and as free ; It warms our bosoms like the thought of those that with us dwelt, Ere friendship to another shrine than friendly hearts had knelt. She humanizes him, and ho Educates her to liberty. Oh ! say not they must soon be old \u2014 Their limbs prove faint, their breasts feel cold ! Yet envy I that sylvan pair More than my words express \u2014 The singular beauty of their lot, And seeming happiness. They have not been reduced to share The painful pleasures of despair ; Their Bun declines not in tho sky, Nor are their wishes east, Like shadows of tho afternoon, Repining towards the past : With naught to dread or to repent, The present yields them full content. In solitude there is no crime ; Their actions all are free, And passion lends their way of lifo The only dignity ; And how can they have any cares \u2014 Whose interest contends with theirs ? There's a gladness in the step of youth, and its bearing frank and high, That the proudest despot of the earth would tremble to defy ; We follow it as if it led to the very mountain's side, Where we chased the bold stag in its speed, and tho eagle in its pride. There's a gladness in the sleep of youth, and its calm, unbroken rest, With the dew of blessing on its head from the foun- tain in its breast ; There's nothing in our after years of weariness like this, Till when the heart is young again in its Sabbath year of bliss. Oh ! we might weep to feel, though soon our earthly years be told, The spirit of our hearts has fled before our hearts are cold; To feel tho loos'ning of the limbs, and bowing of the head, Before tho narrow couch wo need to slumber on be sproad.

For they may sport unharm'd amid the cloud, Or listen at the echoing gate of heaven Without reproof. But as for us, it seems Scarce lawful, with our broken tones, to speak Familiarly of thee. Methinks, to tint Thy glorious features with our pencil's point, Or woo thee to the tablet of a song, Were profanation. Thou dost make the soul A wondering witness of thy majesty ; But as it presses with delirious joy To pierce thy vestibule, dost chain its step, And tame its rapture, with the humbling view Of its own nothingness, bidding it stand In the dread presence of the Invisible, As if to answer to its God through thee. A MOONLIGHT EVENING. The moon is up, and yet it is not night \u2014 Sunset divides the sky with her \u2014 a sea Of glory streams along the Alpine height Of blue Friuli's mountains ; heaven is free From clouds, but of aU colour seems to be, Melted to one vast iris of the west, Where the day joins the past eternity ; While, on the other hand, meek Dian's crest Floats through the azure air \u2014 an island of the blest. MOUNT BLANC. Thou first and chief, sole sov'reign of the vale !

Who sunk thy sinless pillars deep in earth ? Who made thee parent of perpetual streams ? And you, ye five wild torrents fiercely glad, Who called you forth from night and utter death, From dark and icy caverns called you forth, Down those precipitous black jagged rocks, For ever shattered, and the same for ever ? Who gave you your invulnerable life, Your strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy, Unceasing thunder, and eternal foam ? And who commanded (and the silence came), Here let the billows stiffen and have rest ? Ye ieefalls 1 Ye that from the mountain's brow Adown enormous ravines slope amain \u2014 A single star is at her side, and reigns With her o'er half the lowly heaven; but still Yon sunny sea heaves brightly, and remains RoU'd o'er the peak of the Rh\u00e6tian hill, As day and night contending were, until Nature reclaim'd her order ; gently flows The deep-dyed Brenta, where their hues instil The odorous purple of a new-born rose, Which streams upon her stream, and glassed within it glows. Filled with the face of heaven, which from afar Comes down upon the waters ; all its hues, From the rich sunset to the rising star, Their magical variety diffuse : And now they change ; a paler shadow strews Its mantle o'er the mountains ; parting day Dies like the dolphin whom each pang imbues With a new colour as it gasps away, The last stiU lovettest, till \u2014 'tis gone \u2014 and all is gray. Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice, And stopped at once amid their maddest plunge ; Motionless torrents 1 silent cataracts !

Let the torrents like a shout of nations Answer ! and let the ice-plains echo God ! NIAGARA. Flow on for ever in thy glorious robe Of terror and of beauty. Yea, flow on Unfathom'd and resistless. God hath set His rainbow on thy forehead, and the cloud Mantled around thy feet. And He doth give Thy voice of thunder power to speak of Him EternaUy, bidding the lip of man Keep silence, and upon thy rocky altar pour Incense of awe-struck praise. Ah ! who can dare To lift the insect trump of earthly hope, Or love, or sorrow, 'mid the peal sublime Of thy tremendous hymn ? Even ocean shrinks Back from thy brotherhood, and all his waves Retire abash'd. For he doth sometimes seem To sleep like a spent labourer, and recall His wearied billows from their vexing play, And lull them to a cradle-calm ; but thou, With everlasting, undecaying tide, Dost rest not, night or day. The morning stars, When first they sang o'er young creation's birth, Heard thy deep anthem ; and those wrecking fires That wait the archangel's signal to dissolve This solid earth, shall find Jehovah's name Graven, as with a thousand diamond spears, Of thine unending volume. Every leaf That lifts itself within thy wide domain Doth gather greenness from thy living spray, Yet tremble at the baptism. Lo! yon birds Do boldly venture near, and bathe their wing Amid thy mist and foam. 'Tis meet for them To touch thy garment's hem, and lightly stir The snowy leaflets of thy vapour-wreath, God ! sing ye meadow streams with gladsome voice ! Ye pine-groves, with your soft and soul-Uke sounds ; And they too have a voice, yon piles of snow, And in their perUous fall shall thunder \u2014 God ! Ye livery flowers ! that skirt the eternal frost ; Ye wild goats ! sporting round the eagle's nest ! Ye eagles, playmates of the mountain-storm ! Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds !

And to conclude, \u2014 the shepherd's homely curds, His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle, His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade, All which secure and sweetly he enjoys, Is far beyond a prince's delicates, His viands sparkling in a golden cup, His body couched in a curious bed, When care, mistrust, and treason wait on him.

Come, bear thee like a butcher's child, And thou shalt have his taU.\" Straight, straight towards that oaken beam, A trampled pathway ran ; A ghastly shape was swinging there,\u2014 It was the butcher man.

Her strange and tearless grief ; But still with hollow voice and eye She flung her woes at the passers-by, At the honest and at the thief. His home was near ; \" Oh, pity ! and hate me not ! Oh, pity ! and not condemn ! And men were thronging, with that strange delight They have in human passions, to observe For once when I heard of such as myself, 0 God, how I hated them !

The leaves Of the sweet aloe, and the clustering vines Which half conceal'd his threshold, met bis eye, Unchanged and beautiful ; and one by one, The balsam, with its sweet-distilling stems, And the Circassian rose, and all the crowd Of silent and familiar things, stole up, Not me ! not me ! but my crime ; You loathe it not more than I : I could not bear you should love me now ; Yet pity me, e'er I die ! \" I remember the time when he came to me, And smiled, and spoke of love ; \u2014 Oh, the wUdest love and the fiercest hato In a madden'd breast will strangely mate !

She stood and gazed upon him. Was he wroth ? There was no anger in that bloodshot eye. Had sickness seized him ? She unclasp'd his helm, And laid her white hand gently on his brow, And the large veins felt stiff and hard, like cords. The touch aroused him. He raised up his hands, And spoke the name of God in agony. For I doubt that the fruit of my toil was his By the coward's law of might. \" Fool that I was !

THE PRISONER OF CHILLON. My hair is grey, but not with years, Nor grew it white In a single night, As men's have grown from sudden fears : My limbs are bow'd, though not ivith toil, ' But rusted with a vile repose, The other was as pure of mind, But form'd to combat with his kind ; Strong in his frame, and of a mood Which 'gainst the world in war had stood, And perish'd in the foremost rank For they have been a dungeon's spoil. And mine has been the fate of those To whom the goodly 'earth and air Are bann'd and barr'd \u2014 forbidden fare ; With joy : \u2014 but not in chains to pine : His spirit wither'd with their clank, But this was for my father's faith I suffer'd chains and courted death , I saw it silently decUne \u2014 That father perish'd at the stake For tenets he would not forsake ; And for the same his lineal race And so perchance in sooth did mine ; But yet I forced it on to cheer Those reUcs of a home so dear. He was a hunter of the hills, In darkness found a dwelling-place ; We were seven \u2014 who now are one, Six in youth, and one in age, Had foUow'd there the deer and wolf , To him this dungeon was a gulf, Finish'd as they had begun, Proud of Persecution's rage ; And fetter'd feet the worst of ills. One in fire, and two in field, Lake Leman Ues by Chillon's walls; Their beUef with blood have seal'd ; A thousand feet in depth below Its massy waters meet and flow ; Dying as their father died, For the God their foes denied ; Three were in a dungeon cast, Thus much the fathom-line was sent From ChiUon's snow-white battlement, Which round about the wave enthralls 1 Of whom this wreck is left the last. A double dungeon waU and wave They chain'd us each to a column-stone, And we were three \u2014 yet, each alone, We could not move a single pace, We could not see each other's face, But with that pale and Uvid light That made us strangers in our sight ; And thus together \u2014 yet apart, Have made\u2014 and like a living grave, Below the surface of the lake The dark vault lies wherein we lay ; We heard it ripple night and day ; Sounding o'er our heads it knock'd ; And I have felt the winter's spray Wash through the bars when winds were high, Fetter'd in hand, but pined in heart ; 'Twas stUl some solace in the dearth Of the pure elements of earth, To hearken to each other's speech, And each turn comforter to each, With some new hope, or legend old, Or song heroically bold ; And wanton in the happy sky ; And then the very rock hath rock'd, And I have felt it shake, unshock'd, Because I could have smiled to see The death that would have set me free. But even these at length grew cold. Our voices took a dreary tone, An echo of the dungeon-stone, I said my nearer brother pined, I said his mighty heart declined, He loath'd and put away his food ; It was not that 'twas coarse and rude, For we were used to hunter's fare, And for the like had Uttle care : The milk drawn from the mountain goat Was changed for water from the moat, Our bread was such as captive's tears Have moisten'd many a thousand years, Since man first pent his feUow-men A grating sound \u2014 not fuU and free As they of yore were wont to be : It might be fancy \u2014 but to me They never sounded Uke our own. I was the eldest of the three, And to uphold and cheer the rest I ought to do\u2014 and did my best\u2014 And each did weU in his degree. The youngest, whom my father loved, Because our mother's brow was given Like brutes within an iron den : But what were these to us or him ? These wasted not his heart or limb ; My brother's soul was of that mould Which in a palace had grown cold, Had his free breathing been denied The range of the steep mountain's side; But why delay -the truth?\u2014 he died. I saw, and could not hold his head, Nor reach his dying hand \u2014 nor dead, Though hard I strove, but strove in vain, To rend and gnash my bonds in twain. jje died\u2014 and they unlocked his chain, Aud scoop'd for him a shallow grave Even from the cold earth of our cave.

And truly might it be distrest To see such bird in such a nest ; For he was beautiful as day (When day was beautiful to me As to young eagles, being free)\u2014 A polar day, which wiU not see A sunset till its summer's gone, Its sleepless summer of long light, The snow-clad offspring of the sun ; And thus he was as pure and bright, 3fi No. 36."], [302, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 282 I begg'd them, as a boon, to lay His corse in dust whereon the day Might shine \u2014 it was a foolish thought, But then within my brain it wrought, That even in death his freeborn breast In such a dungeon could not rest, I might have spared my idle prayer \u2014 They coldly laugh'd \u2014 and laid him there : The flat and turfless earth above One on the earth, and one beneath \u2014 My brothers \u2014 both had ceased to breaths ; I took that hand which lay so still, Alas ! my own was fuU as chill ; I had not strength to stir or strive, But felt that I was stiU alive \u2014 A frantic feeling, when we know That what we love shaU ne'er be so. I know not why I could not die, The being we so much did love ; His empty chain above it leant, Such murder's fitting monument! I had no earthly hope \u2014 but faith, And that forbade a selfish death. What next befell me then and thero I know not well \u2014 I never knew \u2014 First came the loss of Ught and air, And then of darkness too : But he, the favourite and the flower, Most cherish'd since his natal hour, His mother's image in fair face, The infant love of all his race, His martyr'd father's dearest thought, My latest care, for whom I sought To hoard my life, that his might be Less wretched now, and one day free ; He, too, who yet had held untired A spirit natural or inspired \u2014 I had no thought, no feeling \u2014 none \u2014 Among the stones I stood a stone, And was, scarce conscious what I wist, As shrabless crags within the mist ; For all was blank, and bleak, and grey ; It was not night \u2014 it was not day \u2014 It was not even the dungeon-Ught, So hateful to my heavy sight, He, too, was struck, and day by day Was wither'd on the stalk away. Oh, God ! it is a fearful thing To see the human soul take wing In any shape, in any mood : \u2014 I've seen it rushing forth in blood, I've seen it on the breaking ocean Strive with a swoln convulsive motion, I've seen the sick and ghastly bed Of Sin delirious with its dread : But these were horrors \u2014 this was woe Unmix'd with such \u2014 but sure and slow ; He faded, and so calm and meek, So softly worn, so sweetly weak, But vacancy absorbing space, And fixedness \u2014 without a place ; There were no stars \u2014 no earth \u2014 no time- No check \u2014 no change \u2014 no good \u2014 no crime- But silence, and a stirless breath Which neither was of life nor death ; A sea of stagnant idleness, Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless ! A Ught broke in upon my brain, \u2014 It was the carol of a bird ; It ceased, and then it came again, The sweetest song ear ever heard, And mine was thankful till my eyes So tearless, yet so tender \u2014 land, And grieved for those he left behind ; With all the while a cheek whose bloom Was as a mockery of the tomb, Ran over with the glad surprise, And they that moment could not see I was the mate of misery ; But then by duU degrees came back Whose tints as gently sunk away As a departing rainbow's ray \u2014 An eye of most transparent light, That almost made the dungeon bright, And not a word of murmur \u2014 not A groan o'er his untimely lot, \u2014 My senses to their wonted track, I saw the dungeon waUs and floor Close slowly round me as before, I saw the glimmer of the sun Creeping as it before had done, But through the crevice where it came A Uttle talk of better days, A little hope my own to raise, For I was sunk in silence \u2014 lost In this last loss, of all the most ; And then the sighs he would suppress Of fainting nature's feebleness, That bird was perch'd, as fond and tame, And tamer than upon the tree ; A lovely bird, with azure wings, And song that said a thousand things, And seem'd to say them all for me ! I never saw its like before, More slowly drawn, grew less and less : I listen'd, but I could not hear \u2014 I call'd, for I was wild with fear ; I knew 'twas hopeless, but my dread Would not be thus admonished ; I caU'd, and thought I heard a sound \u2014 I burst my chain with one strong bound, And rushed to him : \u2014 I found him not, I only stirr'd in this black spot, I ne'er shall see its likeness more : It seem'd like me to want a mate, But was not half so desolate, And it was come to love me when None lived to love me so again, And cheering from my dungeon's brink Had brought me back to feel and think. I know not if it late were free, Or broke its cage to perch on mine, But knowing weU captivity, / only lived \u2014 7\" only drew The accursed breath of dungeon-dew ; The last \u2014 the sole \u2014 the dearest link Between me and the eternal brink, Which bound me to my failing race, Was broken in this fatal place.

When skies are blue and earth is gay. It might be months, or years, or days, I kept no count \u2014 I took no note, A kind of change came in my fate, My keepers grew compassionate, I know not what had made them so, They were inured to sights of woe, But so it was: \u2014 my broken chain With Unks unfasten'd did remain, And it was liberty to stride I had no hope my eyes to raise, And clear them of their dreary mote ; At last men came to set me free, I ask'd not why, and reck'd not whore, It was at length the same to me, Fetter'd or fetterless to be, I learn'd to love despair. Along my ceU from side to side, And up and down, and then athwart, And tread it over every part ; And thus when they appear'd at last, And aU my bonds aside were cast, These heavy walls to me had grown A hermitage \u2014 and aU my own ! And half I felt as they were come To tear me from a second home : With spiders I had friendship made, And watch'd them in their sutten trade, Had seen the mice by moonlight play, And why should I feel less than they ? We were all inmates of one place, And I, the monarch of each race, Had power to kill \u2014 yet, strange to tell ! In quiet we had learn'd to dweU \u2014 My very chains and I grew friends, So much a long communion tends To make us what we are : \u2014 even I Regain'd my freedom with a sigh. And round the piUars one by one, Returning where my walk begun, Avoiding only, as I trod, My brothers' graves without a sod ; For if I thought with heedless tread My step profaned their lowly bed, My breath came gaspingly and thick, And my crush'd heart feU blind and sick. I made a footing in the wall, It was not therefrom to escape, For I had buried one and all Who loved me in a human shape ; And the whole earth would henceforth be A wider prison unto me : No child \u2014 no sire \u2014 no kin had 1, No partner in my misery ; I thought of this, and I was glad, HANG UP HIS HARP; HE'LL WAKE NO MORE. His young bride stood beside his bed, For thought of them had made me mad; But I was curious to ascend Her weeping watch to keep ; To my barr'd windows, and to bend Once more, upon the mountains high, Hush ! hush ! he stirr'd not \u2014 was he dead, Or did he only sleep ? Tho quiet of a loving eye. His brow was calm, no change was there, No sigh had fiU'd his breath ; I saw them \u2014 and they were the same, They were not changed like me in frame ; I saw their thousand years of snow Oh ! did he wear that smile so fair In slumber or in death ? On high \u2014 their wide long lake below, And the blue Rhone in f uUest flow ; \"Reach down his harp,\" she wUdly cried, \" And if one spark remain, I heard the torrents leap and gush Let him but hear ; Loch Erroch's side,' He'll kindle at the strain.

How stUl the morning of the hallow'd day ! Mute is the voice of rural labour, hush'd The ploughboy's whistle, and the milkmaid's song. The scythe lies glittering in the dewy wreath Of tedded grass, mingled with fading flowers, That yester-morn bloom'd waving in the breeze. Sounds the most faint attract the ear \u2014 the hum Of early bee, the trickling of the dew, And were taught, and train'd, and school'!, Conceived this ponderous monarch Was bountiful, wise, and good ; And held it just to kneel in the dust, And smear him with gratitude. And whenever the people murmur'd, The king and his statesmen frown'd, But stoutly refused to aid them ; \u2014 The distant bleating midway up the hill. Calmness seems throned on yon umnoving cloud. To him who wanders o'er the upland leas, The blackbird's note comes mellower from the dale ; And sweeter from the sky the gladsome lark Warbles his heaven-tuned song ; the lulling brook Murmurs more gently down the deep-sunk glen ; While from yon lowly roof, whose curling smoke O'ermounts the mist, is heard at intervals And so the world went round. He was a drowsy monarch, They were a drowsy crew, And from hour to hour, in their pride of power, DuUer and drowsier grew : But a cry for reformation, Which rose for evermore, Disturb'd their sleep with its mutterings deep, And stirr'd them to the core. The voice of psalms, the simple song of praise. With dove-Uke wings, Peace o'er yon village broods : \" We wUl not change,\" said the courtiers, \" For change is ever an iU ; The dizzying mitt-wheel rests ; the anvil's din Hath ceased ; all, all around is quietness.

And another would rove with his first young love In the dewy fields of morn, Till tears would start from his bursting heart, Yet mark me, crew, whate'er we rue For the corpse that Ueth there, Though ages set you will ne'er forget That dead man's dying stare. Which the others laughed to scorn. But the captain's brow grew darker now, And his glance was cold and grave ; And apart from the rest, with frenzied breast, He gazed upon the wave.

The sunlight of morning streams on his clos'd eyes. O'er him stands Besme, his sword dripping gore, And Guise in his triumph scowls in from the door.

A worthy Squire, of sober life, Had a conceited boasting wife ; Of him she daUy made complaint, Herself she thought a very saint. She lov'd to load mankind with blame, And on their errors build her fame. Her favourite subject of dispute Was Eve and the forbidden fruit. \"Had I been Eve,\" she often cried, \" Man had not fall'n, nor woman died. I still had kept the orders given, Nor for an apple lost my heaven ; Why I'm forbid to tift this cover One glance wUl tell, and then 'tis over.

She calls, she screams with wild surprise. \" Haste, John, and catch these birds,\" she cries John hears not, but to crown her shame, In at her call her husband came. Sternly he frown'd as thus he spoke, \" Thus is your vow'd allegiance broke ? Sett-ign'rance led you to believe You did not share the sin of Eve. Like her's, how blest was your condition ! How smaU my gentle prohibition ! Yet you, tho' fed with every dainty, Sat pining in the midst of plenty ; This dish, thus singled from the rest, Of your obedience was the test ; To gratify my curious mind I ne'er had ruin'd all mankind ; Nor from a vain desire to know, EntaU'd on all my race such woe.\" The Squire replied, \"I fear 'tis true, The same ill spirit lives in you ; Tempted alike, I dare beUeve, You would have disobey 'd, like Eve.\" The lady storm'd and still denied Both curiosity and pride. Your mind, unbroke by self-denial, Could not sustain this slender trial. HumUity from hence be taught, Learn candour to another's fault; Go, know, like Eve, from this sad dinner, You're both a vain and curious sinner.\" The Squire some future day at dinner, Resolved to try this boastful sinner ; He griev'd such vanity possess'd her, And thus in serious terms address'd her,"], [309, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 289 And an inquiring wUdness flashing through The thin grey lashes of her fever'd eyes, She came where Jesus stood beside the way. He look'd upon her, and his heart was moved. \" Weep not !\" he said ; and as they stay'd the bier, And at his bidding laid it at his feet, He gently drew the paU from out her grasp, And laid it back in sUence from the dead. With troubled wonder the mute throng drew near, And gazed on his calm looks. A minute's space He stood and pray'd. Then, taking the cold hand, He said, \" Arise !\" And instantly the breast Heaved in its cerements, and a sudden flush Ran through the lines of the divided lips, And with a murmur of his mother's name, He trembled and sat upright in his shroud. And, while the mourner hung upon his neck, Jesus went calmly on his way to Nain. THE WIDOW OF NAIN. The Roman sentinel stood, helm'd and tall, Beside the gate of Nain. The busy tread Of comers to the city mart was done, For it was almost noon, and a dead heat Quiver'd upon the fine and sleeping dust, And the cold snake crept panting from the wall, And bask'd his scaly circles in the sun. Upon his spear the soldier lean'd, and kept His idle watch, and, as his drowsy dream Was broken by the soUtary foot Of some poor mendicant, he raised his head To curse him for a tributary Jew, And slumberously dozed on. 'Twas now high noon. The dull, low murmur of a funeral Went through the city \u2014 the sad sound of feet Unmix'd with voices \u2014 and the sentinel Shook off his slumber, and gazed earnestly Up the wide streets along whose paved way The silent throng crept slowly. They came on, Bearing a body heavily on its bier, HART-LEAP WELL. [Hart-Leap Well is a small spring of water, about five miles from Richmond, in Yorkshire, and near the side of the road which leads from Richmond to Askrigg. Its name is derived from a remarkable chase, the memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second part of the following poem, which monuments do now exist as I have there described them.] And by the crowd that in the burning sun Walk'd with forgetful sadness, 'twas of one Mourn'd with uncommon sorrow. The broad gate Swung on its hinges, and the Roman bent His spear-point downwards as the bearers pass'd, Bending beneath their burden. There was one \u2014 Only one mourner. Close behind the bier, Crumpling the pall up in her wither'd hands, FoUow'd an aged woman. Her short steps Falter'd with weakness, and a broken moan Fell from her lips, thicken'd convulsively As her heart bled afresh. The pitying crowd FoUow'd apart, but no one spoke to her. The Knight had ridden down from Wensley Moor With the slow motion of a summer's cloud ; He turn'd aside towards a vassal's door, And \"Bring another horse !\" he cried aloud. \" Another horse !\" that shout the vassal heard, And saddled his best steed, a comely grey ; Sir Walter mounted him ; he was the third Which he had mounted on that glorious day She had no kinsmen. She had Uved alone \u2014 A widow with one son. He was her all \u2014 The only tie she had in the wide world \u2014 And he was dead. They could not comfort her. Joy sparkled in the prancing courser's eyes : The horse and horseman are a happy pair \u2022 But, though Sir Walter like a falcon flies, There is a doleful sUence in the air. Jesus drew near to Nain as from the gate The funeral came forth. His lips were palo With the noon's sultry heat. The beaded sweat Stood thickly on his brow, and on the worn And simple latchets of his sandals lay, A rout this morning left Sir Walter's hall, That as they gallop'd made the echoes roar( But horse and man are vanish'd, one and all ; Such race, I think, was never seen before. Sir Walter, restless as a veering wind, Calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain ; Thickly, the white dust of travel. He had come Since sunrise from Capernaum, staying not To wet his Ups by green Bethsaida's pool, Nor wash his feet in Kishon's silver springs, Nor turn him southward upon Tabor's side To catch Gilboa's Ught and spicy breeze. Brach, Swfft, and Music, noblest of their kind, Follow, and up the weary mountain strain. The Knight halloo'd, he chid and cheer'd them on With suppliant gestures and upbraidings stern; But breath and eyesight fail, and one by one The dogs are stretch'd among the mountain fem Genesareth stood cool upon the East, Fast by the Sea of GalUee, and there The weary traveller might bide tiU eve ; And on the alders of Bethulia's plains The grapes of Palestine hung ripe and wild ; Yet turn'd he not aside, but, gazing on, From every swelUng mount, he saw afar, Amid the hills, the humble spires of Nain, The place of his next errand ; and the path Touch'd not Bethulia, and a league away Upon the East lay pleasant GalUee. Where is the throng, the tumult of the race? The bugles that so joyfully were blown ? This chase it looks not Uke an earthly chase ; Sir Walter and the Hart are left alone. The poor Hart toils along the mountain-side; I wUl not stop to teU how far he fled, Nor will I mention by what death he died ; But now the Knight beholds him lying dead. Forth from the city gate the pitying crowd FoUow'd the stricken mourner. They came near The place of burial, and, with straining hands, Closer upon her breast she clasp'd the paU, And with a gasping sob, quick as a chUd's, Dismounting then, he lean'd against a thorn ; Ho had no follower \u2014 dog, nor man, nor boy He neither smack'd his whip nor blew bis horn, But gazed upon the spoU with silent joy. No. 37. 37"], [310, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 290 Close to the thorn on which Sir Walter lean'd, Stood his dumb partner in this glorious act, PAKT SECOND. The moving accident is not my trade : To freeze the blood I have no ready arts : Weak as a lamb the hour that it is yean'd, And foaming like a mountain cataract. 'Tis my delight, alone in summer shade, To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts. Upon his side the Hart was lying stretch'd : His nose half touch'd a spring beneath a hill, And with the last deep groan his breath had f etch'd, The waters of the spring were trembling still. As I from Hawes to Richmond did repair, It chanced that I saw, standing in a dell, Three aspens at three corners of a square ; And one, not four yards distant, near a weU. And now, too happy for repose or rest, (Was never man in such a joyful case !) Sir Walter walk'd all round, north, south, and west, What this imported I could iU divine : And, pulling now the rein, my horse to stop, I saw three piUars standing in a Une, The last stone pttlar on a dark hftl-top. And gazed and gazed upon that darhng place. And climbing up the hill (it was at least Nine rods of sheer ascent), Sir Walter found The trees were grey, with neither arms nor head ; Half-wasted the square mound of tawny green ; Three several hoof-marks which the hunted beast Had left imprinted on the verdant ground. So that you just might say, as then I said, \" Here, in old time, the hand of man hath been.\" Sir Walter wiped his face, and cried, \" TUl now Such sight was never seen by living eyes : I look'd upon the hill both far and near ; More doleful place did never eye survey: Three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow, Down to the very fountain where he lies. It seem'd as if the spring-time came not here, And Nature here were willing to decay. \"I'll buUd a pleasure-house upon this spot, And a small arbour made for rui ll joy ; I stood, in various thoughts and fancies lost, When one who was in shepherd's garb attired 'Twill be the traveller's shed, the ;,_ilgrim.'s cot, A place of love for damsels that are coy. Came up the hoUow : him did I accost, And what this place might be I then inquired. \" A cunning artist will I have to frame A basin for that fountain in the deU ; The shepherd stopp'd, and that same story told Which in my former rhyme I have rehearsed. And they who do make mention of the same From this day forth shall call it ' Hart-Leap WeU.' \" A jolly place,\" said he, \"in times of old ! But something ails it now ; the spot is cursed. \" You see these lifeless stumps of aspen wood \u2014 Some say that they are beeches, others elms \u2014 \" And, gallant brute ! to make thy praises known, Another monument shall here be raised ; Three several piUars, each a rough-hewn stone, And planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazed. These were the bower ; and here a mansion stood, The finest palace of a hundred realms ! \" The arbour does its own condition teU ; You see the stones, the fountain, and the stream \" And in the summer-time, when days are long, I wiU come hither with my paramour ; But as to the great lodge ! you might as well Hunt haU a day for a forgotten dream. And with the dancers, and the minstrel's song, We wUl make merry in that pleasant bower. \" There's neither dog nor heifer, horse nor sheep, WiU wet his Ups within that cup of stone ; \" TUl the foundations of the mountains fail, My mansion with it3 arbour shaU endure \u2014 And oftentimes, when aU are fast asleep, This water doth send forth a dolorous groan. The joy of them who tUl the fields of Swale, And them who dweU among the woods of Ure !\" \" Some say that here a murder has been done, And blood cries out for. blood ; but for my part, Then home he went, and left the Hart, stone dead, With breathless nostrils, stretch'd above the spring. I've guess'd, when I've been sitting in the sun, That it was all for that unhappy Hart. \u2014 Soon did the Knight perform what he had said, And far and wide the fame thereof did ring. \"What thoughts must through the creature's brain pass'd ! Ere thrice the moon into her port had steer'd, A cup of stone received the living well ; Even from the topmost stone, upon the steep, Are but three bounds \u2014 and look, sir, at this last Three pillars of rude stone Sir Walter rear'd, And built a house of pleasure in the dell. \u2014 Oh master ! it has been a cruel leap. And near the fountain, flowers of stature tail, With traiUng plants and trees were intertwined. \"For thirteen hours he ran a desperate race ; And in my simple mind we cannot tell Which soon composed a Uttle sylvan hall \u2014 A leafy shelter from the sun and wind. What cause the Hart might have to love this place, And come and make his death-bed near the weU. And thither, when the summer days were long . Sir Walter journey'd with his paramour ; And with the dancers, and the minstrel's song, Made merriment within that pleasant bower. \" Here on the grass, perhaps, asleep he sank, LuU'd by this fountain in the summer-tide ; This water was perhaps the first he drank, When he had wander'd from his mother's side. \" In April, here beneath the scented thorn, He heard the birds their morning carols sing ; And he, perhaps, for aught we know, was born Not half a furlong from that selfsame spring. The Knight, Sir Walter, died in course of time, Aud his bones lie in his paternal.vale.\u2014 But there is matter for a second rhyme, And I to this would add another tale."], [311, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 291 \"But now here's neither grass nor pleasant shade, The sun on drearier hoUow never shone ; So will it be, as I have often said, TUl trees and stones, and fountain all are gone.\" \"Grey-headed shepherd, thou hast spoken well; SmaU difference Ues between thy creed and mine : This beast not unobserved by Nature fell ; His death was mourn'd by sympathy divine. \" The Being, that is in the clouds and air, That is in the green leaves among the groves, Maintains a deep and reverential care For the unoffending creatures whom He loves. \" The pleasure-house is dust ; behind, before\u2014 This is no common waste, no common gloom ; But Nature, in due course of time, once more Shall here put on her beauty and her bloom. \" She leaves these objects to a slow decay, That what we are, and have been, may be known ; But, at the coming of the mUder day, These monuments shaU all be overgrown.

Thou art, 0 God, the life and Ught Of all this wondrous world we see ; But a wild plain of far extent, And bounded by a forest black; And, save the scarce seen battlement On distant heights of some strong hold, Against the Tartars built of old, No trace of man. The year before A Turkish army had march'd o'er ; And where the Spahi's hoof hath trod, The verdure flies the bloody sod : The sky was dull, and grim, and grey, And a low breeze crept moaning by\u2014 Its glow by day, its smile by night, Are but reflections caught from The&.

I could have answered with a sigh \u2014 But fast we fled, away, away, When Night, with wings of starry gloom, O'ershadows all the earth and skies, And I could neither sigh nor pray ; And my cold sweat-drops feU like rain Upon the courser's bristling mane ; But, snorting stiU with rage and fear, He flew upon his far career : Like some dark, beauteous bird, whose plume Is sparkling with unnumber'd eyes \u2014 That sacred gloom, those fires divine, So grand, so countless, Lord! are Thine. At times I almost thought, indeed, He must have slacken'd in his speed ; But no\u2014 my bound and slender frame Was nothing to his angry might, And merely like a spur became : Each motion which I made to free My swoln Umbs from their agony Increased his fury and affright : I tried my voice, \u2014 'twas faint and low, But yet he swerv'd, as from a blow ; And, starting to each accent, sprang As from a sudden trumpet's clang : Meantime my cords were wet with gore, Which, oozing through my Umbs, ran o'er ; And in my tongue the thirst became When youthful Spring around us breathes, Thy Spirit warms her fragrant sigh ; And every flower the Summer wreathes Is born beneath that kindUng eye.

And what with fury, fear, and wrath, The tortures which beset my path, Cold, hunger, sorrow, shame, distress, Thus bound in nature's nakedness ; Sprung from a race whose rising blood, When stirr'd beyond its calmer mood, And trodden hard upon, is Uke With spur and bridle undefiled \u2014 'Twas but a day he had been caught ; And snorting, with erected mane, And straggling fiercely, but in vain, In the fuU foam of wrath and dread To me the desert-born was led : They bound mo on, that menial throng, The rattlesnake's, in act to strike, What marvel if this worn-out trunk Beneath its woes a moment sunk ?

When launch'd, as on the lightning's flash, My heart turn'd sick, my brain grew sore, And throbb'd awhUe, then beat no more : The skies spun Uke a mighty wheel ; I saw the trees like drunkards reel, And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes, Which saw no farther : he who dies Can die no more than then I died. O'ertortured by that ghastly ride, They bade me to destruction dash, That one day I should come again, With twice five thousand horse, to thank The Count for his uncourteous ride. They play'd me then a bitter prank, When, with the wild horse for my guide, They bound me to his foaming flank : At length I play'd them one as frank \u2014 I felt the blackness come and go, For time at last sets all things even \u2014 And if we do but watch the hour, There never yet was human power And strove to wake ; but could not make My senses climb up from below : I felt as on a plank at sea, Which could evade, if unforgiven, The patient search and vigil long Of him who treasures up a wrong.

With lonely lustre, all his own. My thoughts came back ; where was I ? Cold, And numb, and giddy : pulse by pulse Life reassumed its lingering hold, And throb by throb, \u2014 till grown a pang Which for a moment would convulse, My blood reflow'd, though thick and chill ; My ear with uncouth noises rang, My heart began once more to thrill ; My sight return'd, though dim ; alas ! And thicken'd, as it were, with glass. Methought the dash of waves was nigh ; There was a gleam, too, of the sky, Studded with stars ; \u2014 it is no dream : The wUd horse swims the wilder stream ! The bright broad river's gushing tide Sweeps, winding onward, far and wide, And we are haU-way, struggling o'er To yon unknown and sUent shore.

Many a werst, Panting as if his heart would burst, The weary brute still stagger'd on ; And stiU we were\u2014 or seem'd \u2014 alone. At length, whUe reeling on our way, Methought I heard a courser neigh, From out yon tuft of blackening firs. Is it the wind those branches stirs ? No, no ! from out the forest prance In those suspended pangs I lay, I could not tell ; I scarcely knew If t.bia were human breath I drew.

The manuscript goes on to say that the art of roasting, or rather broiling (which I take to be the elder brother), was accidentally discovered in the manner fol lowing : \u2014 Bo-bo, whose scent was wonderfully sharpened since morning, soon raked out another pig, and fairly rending it asunder, thrust the lesser half by main force into the fists of Ho-ti, stiU shouting out, \" Eat, eat, eat the burnt pig, father; only taste! 0, Lord!\" with such-like bar barous ejaculations, cramming all the while as if he would choke. The swineherd, Ho-ti, having gone out into the wood one morning, as his manner was, to coUect food for his hogs, left his cottage in the care of his eldest son, Bo-bo, a great lubberly boy, who being fond of playing with fire, as younkers of his age commonly are, let some sparks escape into a bundle of straw, which, kindling quickly, spread the conflagration over every part of their poor mansion, tiU it was reduced to ashes. Together with the cottage (a sorry antediluvian makeshift of a buttd ing, you may think it), what was of much more import ance, a fine litter of new-farrowed pigs, no less than nine in number, perished. China pigs have been esteemed a luxury all over the East, from the remotest periods that we read of. Bo-bo was in the utmost consternation, as you may think, not so much for the sake of the tenement, which his father and he could easily build up again with a few dry branches and the labour of an hour or two at any time, as for the loss of the pigs. Ho-ti trembled every joint whUe he grasped the abomi nable thing, wavering whether he should not put his son to death for an unnatural young monster, when the crack- Ung, scorching his fingers as it had done his son's, and applying the same remedy to them, he in his turn tasted some of its flavour, which, make what sour mouths he would for a pretence, proved not altogether displeasing to him. In conclusion (for the manuscript here is a Uttle tedious) both father and son fairly sat down to the mess, and never left off tUl they had despatched all that re mained of the litter. Bo-bo was strictly enjoined not to let the secret escape, for the neighbours would certainly have stoned them for a couple of abominable wretches, who could think of im proving upon the good meat which God had sent them. Nevertheless, strange stories got about. It was observed that Ho-ti's cottage was burnt down now more frequently than ever. Nothing but fires from this time forward. Some would break out in broad day, others in the night time. As often as the sow farrowed, so sure was the house of Ho-ti to be in a blaze ; and Ho-ti himself, which was the more remarkable, instead of chastising his son, seemed to grow more indulgent to him than ever. At length they were watched, the terrible mystery discovered, and father and son summoned to take their trial at Pekin, then an inconsiderable assize town. Evidence was given, the obnoxious food itself produced in court, and verdict about to be pronounced, when the foreman of the jury begged that some of the burnt pig, of which the culprits stood accused, might be handed into the box. He handled it, and they all handled it, and burning theft fingers as Bo-bo and his father had done before them, and nature prompting to each of them the same remedy, against the face of all the facts, and the clearest charge which judge had ever given, \u2014 to the surprise of the whole Court, townsfolk, strangers, reporters, and all present \u2014 without leaving the box, or any manner of consultation whatever, they brought in a simultaneous verdict of Not Guilty. While he was thinking what he should say to his father, and wringing his hands over the smoking remnants of one of those untimely sufferers, an odour assailed his nostrils unlike any scent which he had before experienced. What could it proceed from ? Not from the burnt cot tage \u2014 he had smelt that smell before ; indeed, this was by no means the first accident of the kind which had oc curred through the negligence of this unlucky young fire brand \u2014 much less did it resemble that of any known herb, weed, or flower. A premonitory moistening at the same time overflowed his nether lip. He knew not what to think. He next stooped down to feel the pig, if there were any signs of life in it. He burnt his fingers, and to cool them he applied them, in his booby fashion, to his mouth. Some of the crumbs of the scorched skin had come away with his fingers, and for the first time in his life (in the world's life, indeed, for before him no man had known it) he tasted \u2014 crackling I Again he felt and fumbled at the pig. It did not burn him so much now, still he licked his fingers from a sort of habit. The truth at length broke into his slow understanding that it was the pig that smelt so, and the pig that tasted so deUcious; and surrendering himself up to the new-born pleasure, he fell to tearing up whole handfuls of the scorched skin with the flesh next it, and was cramming it down his throat in his beastly fashion, when his sire entered amid the smoking rafters, armed with retributory cudgel ; and finding how affairs stood, began to rain blows upon the young rogue's shoulders as thick as haUstones, which Bo-bo heeded not any more than if they had been flies. The tickling pleasure which he experienced in his lower regions had rendered him quite callous to any inconve niences he might feel in those remote quarters. His father might lay on, but he could not beat him from his pig tiU he had fairly made an end of it ; when, becoming a Uttle more sensible of his situation, something like the follow ing dialogue ensued. The judge, who was a shrewd feUow, winked at the manifest iniquity of the decision : and, when the Court was dismissed, went privily and bought up all the pigs that could be had for love or money. In a few days his lordship's town house was observed to be on fire. The thing took wing, and now there was nothing to be seen but fires in every direction. Fuel and pig3 grew enor mously dear aU over the district. The insurance offices one and aU shut up shop. People buUt sttghter and slighter every day, until it was feared that the very science of architecture would in no long time be lost to the world. Thus this custom of firing houses continued, tiU, in process of time, says the manuscript, a sage arose, Uke our Locke, who made a discovery, that the flesh of swine, or, indeed, of any other animal, might be cooked (burnt, as they catted it) without the necessity of consum ing a whole house to dress it. Then first began the rude form of a gridiron. Roasting by the string, or spit, came in a century or two later \u2014 I forget in whose dynasty. By such slow degrees, concludes the manuscript, do the most useful, and seemingly the most obvious, arts make their way among mankind. \"You graceless whelp, what have you got there devour ing?

And broken sentences :\u2014 some raised their hands, Look'd up to Heaven, and shook their heads and sigh'd, While twenty voices speaking all at once, Told the same story twenty different ways. \"Here comes tho other Englishman,\" said one: \" There's a sad sight within !\" \" Ay ! sad indeed !\" Replied another. Quickly passing through, I forced my way into the inner room, And thero beheld poor Huntley on the bed, With Vere beside him, kneeling on the ground, Clasping his haud3, and burying his face Between them, and the body of his friend. In aU the beauty and the pride of youth, Huntley went forth at morning, and ere night He lay a corpse. \u2014 An awful loveliness (by permission.) Of what shall travellers talk on rainy days ? Of rain and snow ? the sunshine and the storm ? Of Politics ? Religion ? Scandal ? Shop ? Or personal anecdote ? The weather ? No :\u2014 The topic is full stale. Of politics ? 'Tis dangerous ground. Of creed ? More dangerous still Of scandal ? Heaven f orefend ! Or of the shop ? I prithee let us leave the shop alone ! Of personal anecdote ? Why, what is that But the old scandal in a new disguise ! What shall we talk of, then ? I know not well, Unless you hear a mournful thing that chanced Here in the Pyrenees, two years ago. I parted from the heroes of the tale, Sat on his clay-cold form ; so calm he lay Amid the hurry and anxiety Two friends and comrades, in this very room, And Uttle thought, amid their merriment, Their lusty health and joyous hopefulness, How soon the end would come. This cabaret Resounding now with laughter, jest, and talk, Seems no fit scene to lodge a tragedy. Yet so it was : \u2014 but let me tell the tale. And deep distress and pitying words and groans Of those around \u2014 it seem'd as he alone Of all that crowd were happy. He was dead ; \u2014 But how he died, 'twas long ere I could learn From the survivor, who with senseless words, And sobs, and groans, and prayers to Heaven for hflp, Broke off continually what he began. 'Twas in September, just two years ago, I learn'd it afterwards when he grew calm, That Vere and Huntley, youths scarce twenty-one, And fresh from Cambridge on their way to Spain, Stopp'd in the Pyrenees. They did not hunt, Or shoot, or angle, or deUght in sport, And loved him ever since. They'd track'd the stream From morn till noon, discovering as they went, New beauties, grandeurs, and sublimities At every step. Right weU in all her moods, Those friends congenial loved dear Nature's face. But seem'd to glory in ascending hills, Scaling high rocks, and tracking waterfalls. They loved the rude and dizzy mountain-top, And all the splendour of its wildest scenes. Vere had a poet's eye and painter's hand, And Huntley, though no poet, stored his mind With images of beauty : \u2014 both would walk Three leagues ere breakfast to a precipice, To see the sunrise in its majesty ; 'Twas now the torrent with its burst and fall, That charm'd their sight ; now, 'twas th' umbrageous arch Of trees, high-perch'd on the o'erhanging rock ; Then 'twas the rock itself, with lichens grown, And pine and larch ;\u2014 and then it was a glimpse Betwixt the crags into a world beneath, Stretching in loveliness of cultured plains, Studded with farms and clustering viUages That fiU'd them with delight.\u2014 And so they clomb From crag to crag, and conquer'! as they went More perils than they knew : lured ever on By novelty of beauty and the heat Of young adventure ; but they clomb too well. Vere took an upward track, and scaledthe crag, While Huntley travelling lower, reach'd a ledge- He knew not how\u2014 where, pausing on the brink With scarcely room enough to lodge bis heel, He could not stand with safety \u2014 or descend Without the risk of falling from the height, Ever on foot, and ever fuU of joy. Their cheeks were tann'd in the healthy open air ; Their limbs were vigorous, their hearts were light, Their talk was cheerful as the song of birds ; And when they laugh'd, the clear loud volleys rang With such contagious music, that I've laugh'd For very sympathy, yet knew not why. It was a lovely morning, crisp and fresh, When they invited me to join their walk, And trace a mountain-torrent to its source. They had no object but the exercise, And search for natural beauty, ever new. But I had promised Jean Baptiste, the guide, To hunt the chamois with him, and I long'd For my own sport, more hazardous than theirs, And more congenial to my ruder tastes. And so we parted. \" We'll be back,\" said Vere, \"At six, to dinner in the cabaret : WUt thou dine with us, Nimrod of the hills ?\" \u00ab With all my heart !\" and so we went our ways, And far adown the valley I could hear Their jocund voices singing English songs, And catch amid the pauses of the tune The echoes of their laughter on the wind. Two hundred feet, into a chasm below, Where boil'd the angry flood o'er jutting rocks. Ten feet above him in security Stood Vere\u2014 alarm'd,\u2014 but how to reach his friend Seem'd to defy aU knowledge to discern, Or known, his utmost daring to attempt. To mount seem'd easier than to clamber down \u2022, And he was growing dizzy where he stood. Vere stretch'd himself upon the beetUng edge Of the tall precipice, and held his hand Towards his friend, in hope, if hands could meet, He might, by help of some projecting root, Some angle of the rock, or tufted herb, Hoist him in safety ; but the attempt was vain. Their hands, by utmost stress of yearning grasp Could reach no nearer than a long arm's length ; So Vere bethought him of his walking-stick, \\n old companion of his mountain walks, And stretch'd the handle to his eager friend, I had good sport upon the hills that day. When I return'd, I noticed as I came A crowd of peasants standing at the door ; Here was a group of women,\u2014 there, of men; And all discussing something that had chanced, 39 No. 39."], [326, "306 THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. That he might grasp it with his strong right hand, And with his left spring upward to the root, When I watched every bubble that broke on a weed, Yet found I caught nothing but lily and reed ; Till time and discernment began to instU The manoeuvres of Walton with infinite skill. Twisted and sinuous, of a mountain ash That nodded o'er the stream ; and by this aid Attain the safe high platform of the rock. He caught the friendly aid ; but as he grasp'd, He felt it lengthening \u2014 lengthening \u2014 in his hand ; And his eyes swam in horror as he saw Full soon I disco'\u00bber'd the birch-shadow'd place That nurtured the trout and the silver-backed dace; Where the coming of night found me blest and content, With my patience unworn, and my fishing-rod bent. The handle separating from the stick, Leaving a scabbard in the hand of Vere, The sword in his. Vere shriek'd in agony : He had forgotten. Huntley groan'd but once \u2014 Cried to his God for mercy on his soul, And lost his footing. Down amid the rocks He fell \u2014 and fell again, and all was o'er. How fresh were the flags on the stone-studded ridge, That rudely supported the narrow oak bridge : And that bridge, oh ! how boldly and safely I ran On the thin plank that now I should timidly scan. I traversed it often at fall of tho night, When the clouds of December shut out the moon's light ; A mother might tremble, but I never did ; When Vere descended by the usual path And found his friend, the breath of life had fled ; The skull was fractured, but his face unhurt, Seem'd as he slumber'd, while his stiff cold hand Still held the fatal sword-stick in his grasp. They brought the body to the cabaret, For my footing was sure, though the pale stars were hid. When the breath of stenu winter had fetter'd the tide, What joy to career on its feet- warming slide ; With mirth in each eye, and bright health on each cheek, While the gale in our faces came piercing and bleak. And on the third day laid him in his grave. I thought, at times, two other deaths would fill The awful measure of this tragedy. The snowflakes fell thick on our wind-roughen'd curls, But we laugh'd as we shook off the feathery pearls ; And the running, the tripping, the pull and the haul Had a glorious end in the slip and the sprawl. That Vere's remorse, contrition, and despair, At this unhappy, but most innocent act, Would end his days. Yet though his grief was great, 'Twas nothing to the misery I saw Wheu Huntley's mother, young and beautiful, Although her son was twenty years of age, \u2014 Hasten'd from London to behold the grave Where they had lain her darling. Let me close The sad recital: \u2014 language fails to tell Oh ! I loved the wild place where the clear ripples flow'd On their serpentine way o'er the pebble-strew'd road, Where, mounted on Dobbin, we youngsters would dash, Both pony and rider enjoying tho splash. How often I tried to teach Pincher the tricks Of diving for pebbles and swimming for sticks ; But my doctrines could never induce the loved brute To consider hydrauUcs a pleasant pursuit. The holy madness of a grief like hers. THE OLD MILL-STREAM. Beautiful streamlet ! how precious to me Was the green-swarded paradise water'd by thee ; I dream of thee still, as thou wert in my youth, Thy meanderings haunt mo with freshness and truth. Did a forcible argument sometimes prevail, What a woful expression was seen in his tail ; And, though bitterly vex'd, I was made to agree That Dido, the spaniel, swam better than he. I had heard of full many a river of fame, What pleasure it was to spring forth in the sun, When the school-door was oped and our lessons were done When \" Where shall we play ?\" was the doubt and the call, And \" Down by the mill-stream\" was echo'd by all. With its wide rolling flood, and its classical name ; But the Thames of Old England, the Tiber of Rome, Could not peer with the mill-streamlet close to my home. Full well I remember the gravelly spot, When tired of childhood's rude, boisterou3 pranks, We pull'd the tall rushes that grew on its banks ; And, busily quiet, we sat ourselves down To weave the rough basket, or plait the light crown. Where I slyly repair'd though I knew I ought not \u2022 Where I stood with my handful of pebbles to make That formation of fancy, a duck and a drake. How severe was the 6coldiug, how heavy the threat When my pinafore hung on me dirty and wet ; How heedlessly silent I stood to be told Of the danger of drowning, the risk of a cold ! I remember the launch of our fairy-built ship, How we set her white sails, pull'd her anchor atrip ; Till mischievous hands, working hard at the craft, Turn'd the ship to a boat, and the boat to a raft. \" Now mark !\" cried a mother, \"the mischief done there Is unbearable \u2014 go to that stream if you dare !\" But I sped to that stream like a frolicsome colt, For I knew that her thunder-cloud carried no bolt. The first of my doggerel breathings was there, \u2014 'Twas the hope of a poet, \" An Ode to Despair ;\" I won't vouch for its metre, its sense, or its rhyme, But I know that I then thought it truly sublime. Though puzzled with longitude, adverb and noun, Till my forehead was sunk in a studious frown; Yet that stream was a Lethe that swept from my soul The grammar, the globes, and the tutor's control. Beautiful streamlet ! I dream of thee still, Of thy pouring cascade, and the tic-tac-ing mill ; Thou livest in memory, and will not depart, For thy waters seem blent with the streams of my heart. I wonder if stiU tho young anglers begin, As I did, with willow-waud, packthread, and pin ; When I threw in my line, with expectancy high As to perch in my basket, and eels in a pie : Home of my youth ! if I go to thee now, Nono can remember my voice or my brow ; None can remember the sunny-faced child That play'd by the water-mill joyous and wUd."], [327, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 307 The aged, who laid their thin hands on my head, To smooth my dark shining curls, rest with the dead; The young, who partook of my sports and my gleo, Can see nought but a wandering stranger in me.

They led him from the sight of the blue heaven And the green trees, into a low, dark cell, The windows shutting out the blessed sun With iron grating ; and for the first time He threw him on his bed, and could not hear His Isabel's \" Good night !\" But the next morn She was the earliest at the prison gate, SPECULATION.

Scott of Harden was his name ; Wide and far had spread his fame As one whose chief and sole delight Was plundering each English knight. It chanced one eve that after supper, When the liquor had mounted into his upper Storey, he look'd round on each You see, of course, I caU it a lunch 'cause it wasn't a proper meal \u2014 The stingiest master for that couldn't stop a meal. SUently out Went a scout, Prowling about ; The others were waiting, Their lazy work hating, Of his serving-men, and made -this speech: \"I've been thinking\u2014 I've been thinking of the days of An hour or more, in darkness and doubt, And just were beginning to grumble and pout, old, When we used to fight Morning, noon, and night ; And Scott ho was thinking of \"making a clearance,\" When the \" never forgotten \" put in an appearance \u2014 Now our blood is getting cold \u2014 All the English cattle stolen, And, what is worse, they're sold ; Worse still, I find the money's gone ; \u2014 So now a plan I've hit upon \" Sh ! \u2014 don't be afraid ; It's all right for the raid ; The lights are aU out, There's no one about ; It couldn't be better ; \u2014 I teU you, I've been To bring us in some gold. All over everywhere, and it's ' all serene.' \" 44 Then quickly follow me,\" said Scott, \" Every one of you, aU the lot, You know I'm a Scotchman, and I say it's right To plunder and rob every English knight ; But we've plunder'd them aU \u2014 their wealth is all gone, And who is there hero can 'squeeze blood from a And speedily we'U find out what Old Duggold does with the cattle he's got- stone ?' But be sure you do not Let your horses trot, My mind is made up ; \u2014 despite of the watchman, To-night we will go and plunder a Scotchman. Or some one might wake, and then this spot Would prove uncomfortably hot ; So mount we all, my merry men, Nor eat nor drink again till when We've made old Duggold's fences rattle, And eased him of his herds of cattle !\" Not that I fear old Duggold one jot, But ' Silence !' to-night is the word, I wot.1 Quietly now they onward sped ; For ever so long not a word was said ; With right good speed When Scott cried suddenly, \" Stop, my boys ! I'm inclined to think I hear a noise.\" They halted and listen'd, and loud and clear The sound came borne to each startled ear, Nearer coming, and coming more near, And every man then look'd to his gear, Each harness'd his steed, Each flung on his saddle and tighten'd his girth, And away they all gallop'd in noisy mirth : Now down a wild, romantic glen ; Now by a moist and oozy fen ; Now where the red stars hang low and quiver In the tumbUng waves of the noisy river ; Now through dark woods, where the boughs drop low, And the horsemen stoop as they onward go ; Now up a wild and rugged steep, With labouring breath the horses creep ; Along the brow of the hiU they fly ; Now down the side they go thundering by ; Mile after mile they swiftly slew, Till their rough wild beards were spangled with dew ; Mile after mile through the startled night, Till their horses' breasts with foam were white Till their horses' flanks were reeking and hot, Then the gallop gave way to a good round trot. And every man began to feel queer ; For weU they knew \u2014 Both Scott and his crew \u2014 That a storm, without doubt, was beginning to brew; Aud almost before they knew where they were \u2014 Not a minute to spare to utter a prayer \u2014 From over the brow of a hill to the right, A band of horsemen appear'd in sight. Down the valley they flew On to Scott and his crew \u2014 To every one of his men there were two ; And Scott he turn'd white, and his men they look'd blue; But fairplay is fairplay \u2014 so give them their due ; Witu main and with might They tried to show fight, \"Ride softly, my men,\" cried Scott at length \"Ride softly, and spare your horses' strength, For now we are near old Duggold's domain, So slacken your speed and tighten each rein,\" But felt very tired, being out all the night, So were very soon done, For it's really no fun To fight with such odds, namely, two against one. Old Duggold was there, In a deep, dark wood Those horsemen stood ; And to hear that man swear, 'Twas truly shocking, I'm bound to declare."], [331, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 311 Some os Scott's men were knock'd off their horses ; Some of them almost were knock'd into corses ; And some of the knaves, without saying good night, Clapp'd spurs to their chargers and then took to flight. Scott fought hard and long, surrounded by foes ; He crack'd one man's crown, and broke one man's And now we've a chance, I really must say, I think 'twould be wrong to throw it away. Just make Scott the offer, our daughter to wed, And if he refuses, then hang him instead.\" Duggold stroked his grizzled beard ; For awhile he cogitated, Then confess'd nose; He made several see stars, and told one to sheer off, And because he delay'd to, took part of his ear off; He unhorsed half a score, but so many fielded, At last in despair he suUenly yielded. The fight was over \u2014 the battle was won : And Scott confess'd that for once he was \"done \u2022\" Instead of catching what he came \" arter,\" He found to his chagrin that he'd \" caught a tartar ;\" Himself and half of his men were taken, WhUe the rest made off, and thus \"saved their bacon.\" \"Bring some thongs,\" cried old Duggold, \"and bind them Her plan was best \u2014 A good idea to get Meg mated. Then off he went 'like a shot,' To offer tho terms to neighbour Scott. \" Now, look here, Scott ! I know your name, As a borderer bold I've heard your fame ; But it's ' not the thing ' to rob a neighbour ; You fuUy deserve ten years' hard labour ; Or, your previous character being good, Say six years' penal servitude. You didn't rob me ! no, but you meant to ; I can safely swear 'twas your intent to. And truth bo told, Scott, when I took you It was my firm intent to book you ; Or if not understanding slang, you Must have plain terms \u2014 I meant to hang you.\" \"Oh, my!\" said Scott, all surely.\" \" You might excuse me,\" said Scott, \" I feel poorly, And if it's no trouble, and any ways handy, I wish you would give me a ' wee drop ' of brandy.\" \"Heed him not,\" cried old Duggold, \"bind him with the others j\" \" That's rather hot; And they, bound them as tight as the \" Davenport Brothers.\" You surely will behave more handsome ; A hundred pounds What with the fighting, pursuing and taking And four good hounds Of prisoners, by this time the grey dawn was breaking. They led Scott to the castle gate, I'll give you now by way of ransom ; Just let me go \" They march'd him through the door ; Old Duggold look'd hard and stern as fate, And stroked his beard and rubb'd his pate, Said Duggold, \" Oh, no !

We have a priest who you will lix For the trifling fee of twelve-and-six.\" Scott enter'd his gate He should go out aUve no more. In the courtyard now they stand, Scott in the centre of Duggold's band. Duggold had gone to ask his wife For a stout piece of cord At their father's caU, His daughters aU \u2014 One of them short, and two of them tall \u2014 Came to him from the castle wall. And a short piece of board, \" Now, neighbour Scott, To help Scott of Harden out of his life. Said he to his \"missis,\" Here is tho lot !

Lady T. To be sure, what you say is very reasonable ; and when the consciousness of my innocence Joseph S. Ah ! my dear madam, there is the great mis take; 'tis this very conscious innocence that is of the greatest prejudice to you. What is it makes you negligent of forms, and careless of the world's opinion ? \u2014 why, the consciousness of your own innocence. What makes you thoughtless in your conduct, and apt to run into a thou sand little imprudencies ? \u2014 why, the consciousness of your own innocence. What makes you impatient of Sir Peter's temper, and outrageous at his suspicions ? \u2014 why, the con sciousness of your innocence. Joseph S. I am surprised she has not sent, if she is pre vented from coming. Sir Peter certainly does not suspect me. Yet, I wish I may not lose the heiress, through the scrape 1 have drawn mysett into with the wife : however, Charles's imprudence and bad character are great points in my favour.

So, so ; then I perceive your prescription is, that I must sin in my own defence, aud part with my virtue to preserve my reputation. Joseph S. 0 madam, punctuality is a species of constancy very unfashionable in a lady of quality. Joseph S. Exactly so, upon my credit, ma'am. Lady T. Well, certainly this is the oddest doctrine, and the newest receipt for avoiding calumny ! [Places cliairs, and sits after Lady Teazle is seated. Lady T. Upon my word you ought to pity me. Do you know Sir Peter is grown so Ul-natured to me of late, and so jealous of Charles, too \u2014 that's the best of the story, isn't it ? Joseph S. An infallible one, believe me. Prudence, lik\u00bb experience, must be paid for. Lady T. Why, if my understanding were once con vinced Joseph S. I am glad my scandalous friends keep that up. Joseph S. 0, certainly, madam, your understanding should be convinced. Yes, yes ; heaven forbid I should persuade you to do anything yon thought wrong. No, no, I have too much honour to desire it. [Aside. Lady T. I am sure I wish he would let Maria marry him, and then perhaps he would be convinced ; don't you, Mr. Surface ? Lady T. Don't you think we may as well leave honour out of the argument ? [Rises. Joseph S. Indeed, I do not. [Aside.] \u2014 Oh certainly I do ; for then my dear Lady Teazle would also be convinced how wrong her suspicious were of my having any design on the silly girl. Joseph S. Ah ! the ill effects of your country education, I see, still remain with you. [Rises. Lady T. I doubt they do indeed ; and I will fairly own to you, that if I could be persuaded to do wrong, it would be by Sir Peter's iU usage, sooner than your honourable logic, after all. Lady T. Well, well, Tm inclined to believe you. But isn't it provoking to have the most Ul-natured things said of one ? \u2014 And there's my friend, Lady Sneerwell, has cir culated I don't know how many scandalous tales of me, and aU without any foundation too \u2014 that's what vexes me. Josephs. Then, by this hand, which he is unworthy of [Taking her hand. Enter Servant. Joseph S. Aye, madam, to be sure, that is the provoking circumstance \u2014 without foundation; yes, yes, there's the mortification, indeed; for when a scandalous story is beUeved against one, there certainly is no comfort like the consciousness of having deserved it.

Joseph S. But, my dear Lady Teazle, 'tis yotu own fault if you suffer it.

Yes, 'tis but too plain she has not the least regard for me ; but, what's worse, I have pretty good authority to suppose she has formed an attachment to another. Joseph S. Indeed ! You astonish me ! Sir P. Yes ; and, between ourselves, I think I've dis covered the person. Joseph S. How ! You alarm me exceedingly. Sir P. Ay, my dear friend, I knew you would sympa- Joseph S. Nor I, if I could help it. [Aside . Sir P. And now, my dear friend, if you please, we will thise with me ! talk over the situation of your hopes with Maria. Josephs. [Softly.] 0, no, Sir Peter; another time, if Joseph S. Yes ; believe me, Sir Peter, such a discovery would hurt me just as much as it would you. Sir P. I am convinced of it. Ah ! it is a happiness to have a friend whom we can trust even with one's family secrets. But have you no guess who I mean ? you please. Sir P. I am sensibly chagrined at the little progress you seem to make in her affections. Joseph S. I beg you will not mention it, sir. What are my disappointments when your happiness is iu debate ! [Softly.] 'Sdeath ! I shall be ruined every way. [Aside. Sir P. And though you are so averse to my acquainting Lady Teazle with your passion, I am sure she's not your enemy in the affair. Joseph S. I haven't the most distant idea. It can't be Sir Benjamin Backbite ? Sir P. Oh, no ! What say you to Charles ? Josephs. My brother! Impossiblo! Sir P. Oh, my dear friend, the goodness of your own heart misleads you. You judge of others by yourself. Joseph S. Certainly, Sir Peter, the heart that is con scious of its own integrity is ever slow to credit another's baseness. Joseph S. Pray, Sir Peter, now oblige me. I am reaUy too much affected by the subject we have been speaking of, to bestow a thought on my own concerns. The mau who is intrusted with his friend's distresses can never Sir P. True. But your brother has no sentiment ; you never hear him talk so. Joseph S. Yet, I can't but think Lady Teazle herself has too much principle. Enter S er vast. Well, sir ? Sir P. Ay j but what is principle against the flattery of a handsome, lively young fellow ? Serv. Your brother, sir, is speaking to a gentleman in the street, and says he knows you are within. Joseph S. That's very true. Joseph S. 'Sdeath, blockhead, I am not within \u2014 I'm out for the day. i?iV P. And then, you know, the difference of our ages, makes it very improbable that she should have any very great affection for me ; and if she were to be frail, and I were to make ft public, why the town would only laugh at me, the foottsh old bachelor, who had married a g_jL Sir P. Stay, hold \u2014 a thought has struck me. You shall be at home. Joseph S. Woll, well, let him up. [Exit Servant.] He'U interrupt Sir Peter, however. [Aside. Sir P. Now, my good friend, oblige me, I entreat you. Before Charles comes, let me conceal mysett somewhere ; then do you tax him on the point we have been talking, and his answer may satisfy me at once. Joseph S. That's true, to be sure \u2014 they would laugh. Sir P. Laugh ? Ay, and make ballads, and paragraphs, and the devil knows what, of me. Joseph S. No \u2014 you must never make it public. Sir P. But then again \u2014 that the nephew of my old friend, Sir OUver, should be the person to attempt such a wrong, hurts me more nearly. Joseph S. 0 fie ! Sir Peter, would you have me join in so mean a trick ? To trepan my brother, too ? Sir P. Nay, you tell me you are sure he is innocent ; if so, you do him the greatest service by giving him an op portunity to clear himself, and you will set my heart at rest. Come, you shaU not refuse me. [Going up.] Here behind this screen will be \u2014 Hey ! what the devil I there Joseph S. Ay, there's the point. When ingratitude barbs the dart of injury, the wound has double danger in it. Sir P. Ay\u2014 I that was, in a manner, left his guardian ;"], [335, "THE IMPERIAL SPEAKER. 315 seems to be one Ustener here already. I'll swear I saw a ' petticoat. Charles S. Why, I beUeve I should be obliged to Josephs. What? Joseph S. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Well, this is ridiculous enough. I'll tell you, Sir Peter, though I hold a man of intrigue to be a most despicable character, yet, you know, it does not follow that one is to be an absolute Joseph either! Hark'ee, 'tis a Uttle French milliner\u2014 a siUy rogue that plagues me\u2014 and having some character to lose, on your coming, sir, she ran behind the screen. Charles S. To borrow a little of your moraUty, that's aU. But, brother, do you know now that you surprise me exceedingly, by naming me with Lady Teazle ; for, 'faith, I always understood you were her favourite. Joseph S. 0, for shame, Charles ! This retort is foolish. Charles S. Nay, I swear I have seen you exchange such significant glances Sir P. Ah! Joseph! Joseph! did I ever think that you \u2014 But, egad, she has overheard all I have been saying of my wife. Joseph S. Nay, nay, sir, this is no jest. Charles S. Egad, I'm serious. Don't you remember one day when I called here Joseph S. 0, 'twill never go any farther, you may de nd upon it. Joseph S. Nay, pr'ythee, Charles Charles S. And found you together \u25a0 Joseph S. Zounds, sir ! I insist Sir P. No ! then, faith, let her hoar it out. Here's a closet will do as well. Charles S. And another time when your servant\u2014 Joseph S. Brother, brother, a word with you. Gad, I must stop him. [Aside. Charles S. Informed, I say, that Joseph S. Hush ! I beg your pardon, but Sir Peter has heard all we have been saying. I knew you would clear yourself, or I should not have consented. Joseph S. Well, go in there. Sir P. Sly rogue ! sly rogue ! [Going into tlie closet. Joseph S. A narrow escape, indeed ! and a curious situa- tion I'm in, to part man and wife in this manaer. Lady T. [Peeping.] Couldn't I steal off? Joseph S. Keep close, my angel ! Sir P. [Peeping out.] Joseph, tax him home. Charles S. How, Sir Peter! Where is he ? Joseph S. Back, my dear friend. Josephs. Softly, there! [Points to the closet. Charles S. O, 'fore heaven I'U have him out. Sir Peter, Lady T. Couldn't you lock Sir Peter in ? Joseph S. Be stUl, my life ! come forth ! [Trying to get to the closet. Joseph S. No, no \u2014 [Preventing him. Sir P. [Peqring.] You're sure the little milliner won't blab. Charles S. I say, Sir Peter, come into oourt \u2014 [Pulls in Sir Peter.] What ! my old guardian ! \u2014 What ! turn in quisitor, and take evidence incog ? 0 fie ! 0 fie ! Joseph S. In, in, my dear Sir Peter. 'Fore gad I wish I had a key to the door. Enter Charles Surface. Sir P. Give me your hand, Charles \u2014 I believe I have suspected you wrongfuUy ; but you musn't be angry with Joseph \u2014 -'twas my plan ! Charles S. HoUa ! brother, what has been the matter ? Your fellow would not let me up at first. What ! have you had a Jew or a wench with you ? Charles S. Indeed ! Joseph S. Neither, brother, I assure you. Sir P. But I acquit you. I promise you I don't think near so Ul of you as I did : what I have heard has given ue great satisfaction. Charles S. But what has made Sir Peter steal off ? I thought he had been with you. Joseph S. Ho was brother; but, hearing you were coming, he did not choose to stay. Charles S. Egad, then, 'twas lucky you didn't hear any \u00bb:ore \u2014 wasn't it, Joseph ? [Apart to Joseph. Charles S. What ! was tho old gentleman afraid I wanted to borrow money of him ? Sir P. Ah ! you would have retorted on him. Clmrles S. Ay, ay, that was a joke. Joseph S. No, sir ; but I am sorry to find, Charles, that you have lately given that worthy man grounds for great uneasiness. Sir P. Yes, yes, I know his honour too well. Charles S. But you might as well have suspected him as me in this, for all that \u2014 mightn't he, Joseph ? Charles S. Yes, they teU me that I do that to a great many worthy men \u2014 But how so, pray ? [Apart lo Joseph. Sir P. WeU, well, I believe you. Joseph S. Would they were both out of the room ! [Aside. Joseph S. To bo plain with you, brother, he thinks you are endeavouring to gain Lady Teazle's affections from him. Charles S. Who\u2014 I? 0 Lud, not I, upon my word! Ha, ha, ha, ha ! So the old fellow has found out that he has got a young wife, has he ? Joseph S. This is no subject to jest on, brother. He who can laugh Sir P. And, in future, perhaps, we may not be such strangers. Enter Servant. Serv. Lady Sneerwell is below, and says she wUl come up. Josephs. Lady SneerweU ! Gad's life! she must not come here. [Exit Servant.] Gentlemen, I beg pardon I must wait on you downstairs \u2014 here is a person come on particular business. Charles S. True, true, as you were going to say. Then, seriously, I never had the least idea of what you charge me with, upon my honour. Joseph S. WeU, it wiU give Sir Peter great satisfaction to hear this. lAhud- Charles S. To be sure, I once thought the lady seemed to have taken a fancy to me ; but, upon my soul, I never gave her the least encouragement : besides, you know my attachment to Maria. - Joseph S. But sure, brother, even if Lady Teazle had betrayed the fondest partiaUty for you Charles S. Why, look'ee, Joseph, I hope I shall never dettberately do a dishonourable action ; but if a pretty woman was purposely to throw herself in my way, and that pretty woman married to a man old enough to bo her father Charles S. Well, you can see him in another room. Sir Peter and I have not met a long time, and I have some thing to say to him. Joseph S. They must not be left together. [Aside.] Ill send Lady Sneerwell away, and return directly. Sir Peter, not a word of the French milUner. [Apart to Sir Peter, and goes out. Sir P. I ! not for the world ! [Apart to Joseph.] Ah ! Charles, if you associated more with your brother, one might indeed hope for your reformation. He is a man of sentiment. WeU, there is nothing in the world so noble as a man of sentiment.

Sir P. No, no \u2014 Come, come, you wrong him \u2014 No, no ! Joseph is no rake, but he is no saint either, in that re spect. I have a great mind to tell him \u2014 we should have such a laugh at Joseph. [Aside. Sir P. If you please, sir. Joseph S. The fact is, sir, that Lady Teazle, knowing my pretensions to your ward Maria \u2014 I say, sir, Lady Teazle, being apprehensive of the jealousy of your temper Charles S. Oh, hang him! He's a very anchorite, a young hermit. \u2014 and knowing my friendship to the family \u2014 she, sir, I say, \u2014 caUed here \u2014 in order that \u2014 I might explain these pretensions \u2014 but on your coming \u2014 being apprehensive \u2014 as I said \u2014 of your jealousy \u2014 she withdrew \u2014 and this, you may depend on it, is the whole truth of the matter. Sir P. A very clear account, upon my word ; and I dare swear the lady wiU vouch for every articlo of it. Sir P. Hark'ee, you must not abuse him: he may chance to hear of it again, I promise you. Charles S. Why, you won't teU him ? Sir P. No\u2014 but\u2014 this way. Egad, I'll tell him. [Aside.] Hark'ee \u2014 have you a mind to have a good laugh at Joseph ? Lady T. For not one word of it, Sir Peter ! Sir P. How ! don't you think it worth while to agreo Charles S. I should Uke it of all things. Sir P. Then, i'faith, we will \u2014 I'll be quit with him for discovering me. He had a girl with him when I called. [ Whispers. in the lie ? Lady T. There is not one syllable of truth in what that gentleman has told you. Charles S. What, Joseph ? you jest. Sir P. I believe you, upon my soul, ma'am ! Sir P. Hush ! \u2014 a little French milliner ; and the best of the jest is \u2014 she's in the room now. Joseph S. [Aside.] 'Sdeath, madam, will you betray me ? Lady T. Good Mr. Hypocrite, by your leave, I'U speak Charles S. The devil she is ! [Looking at closet. Sir P. Hush ! I'll tell you. [Points to screen. for myself. Sir P.

Charles S. 0, egad, we'll have a peep at the little nnl- a better story than you, without prompting. Lady T. Hear me, Sir Peter ! I came hither on no matter relating to your ward, and even ignorant of this gentleman's pretensions to her. But I came seduced by his insidious arguments, at least to listen to his pretended passion, if not to sacrifice your honour to his base ness. liner ! [Endeavouring to get towards the screen, Sir P. preventing. Sir P. Not for the world \u2014 Joseph wUl never forgive me Sir P. Now, I beUeve, the truth is coming indeed. Charles S. I'll stand by you Sir P. Odds, here he is ! Joseph S. The woman's mad ! Lady T. No, sir, she has recovered her senses, and your own arts have furnished her with the means. Sir Peter, I do not expect you to credit me ; but the tenderness you expressed for me, when I am sure you could not think I was a witness to it, has penetrated my heart, that had I left the place without the shame of this discovery, my future Use should have spoken the sincerity of my gra titude. As for that smooth-tongued hypocrite, who would have seduced the wife of his too credulous friend, while he affected honourable addresses to his ward, I behold him now in a Ught so truly despicable, that I shaft never again respect myself for having listened to him. [Joseph Surface enters just as Charles Surface throws down the screen. Charles S. Lady Teazle, by all that's wonderful ! Sir P. Lady Teazle, by all that's damnable ! Charles S. Sir Peter, this is one of the smartest French milliners I ever saw. Egad, you seem all to have been diverting yourselves here at hide and seek, and I don't see who is out of the secret. Shall I beg your ladyship to inform me ? Not a word ! Brother, will you be pleased to explain this matter? What ! is mortally dumb too ! Sir Peter, though I found you in the dark, perhaps you are not so now ! All mute !
