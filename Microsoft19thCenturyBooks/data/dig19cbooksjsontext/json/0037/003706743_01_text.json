It is a difficult task for a soldier, against whose name \" h. p.\" appears in the Army List, to cement on a literary mosaic such minutiae of his military career as may prove attractive to the eye of the general reader. To a certain degree the task is a sad one. The grim bugler with the scythe has sounded the \" Halt ! Lie down ! \" to many a good comrade, while accident has changed the tenor of the lives of manv \u00bb .j another. Who, for instance, would recognise in the honourable and gallant member for Slowcum-super-Mud, and the ardent upholder of the Anti-Gambling League's peculiar tenets, the gay young subaltern who used to take the odds to a thousand at Ascot and Goodwood? I wonder if the sour-visaged wife of my henpecked old friend in Blankshire knows that her husband was once the darling of all the beauties, married and single, of Simla. \" Rash Jack,\" as we used to call him, is now a director of at least five City companies, though he could never make up his betting book on Saturday night B"], [16, "Through a Field Glass. 2 without assistance.

But, as my impudent young nephew often tells me, I am beo-inning to get prosy, and so had best commence my story of war, love, and sport, before the critic throws aside my book in disgust, or the reader lends it to his worst enemy. At an early age I evinced a pugilistic disposition, for when a diminutive nursemaid told me to stand in the corner of the nursery I countermanded the order and made her stand in the corner, while I did a spell of sentry-go over her, till the unexpected en trance of my father led to the release of the tearful prisoner and my own immediate castigation. At the age of eleven I had a dis ference of opinion with the curate, who was supposed to teach me the mysteries of amo, amas, amat, and, as I conclusively proved to the reverend gentleman that I had a practical knowledge of football, I was sent to Eton, the curate more than hinting that he expected to hear of my expulsion before the completion of mv first term. I, however, remained there for some years,"], [17, "Early Days. 3 in fact until it was time to exchange the slavery of school for the comparative freedom of an army cram mer's. Having been educated at Eton, I was, of course, rather backward. This sounds like blasphemy doubt less, but in my day it used to be said that the boys \"couldn't write their own names, and couldn't make a false quantity \" \u2014 which is not such an exaggeration as it seems, and the last part of the sentence is strictly true. Things have greatly improved since then, no doubt; but it was thought advisable for me to stop with my crammer for at least two years, and I took a step then I never regretted. I joined the \" Artists \" R.V. I knew a good many men in the corps, which was one inducement, and I thought I might just as well learn something of infantry drill before going to Sand hurst, as it looked like a hundred to one chance against my passing into the cavalry. I have still got my old grey uniform, and if ever I have a son\u2014 but my pen is running away witli me. It was while we were at Aldershot for the autumn training that I came across my father's old regiment, thc \u2014 th Lancers, which, of course, I hoped some day to join, and made the accpiaintance of the redoubtable Muldooney, of whom I had often heard. I knew that I should probably come under his hands if I joined, so I stood him unlimited beer and picked his brains. He was a corporal then, but ere I met him again was lance-sergeant. His name was Cornelius, or as he said \" Cornaylius,\" Muldooney, and he came from Cork. He was a big, warm-hearted, and emotional scamp, who wore his forage cap over his right eyebrow at an angle that fired B 2"], [18, "Through a Field Glass. 4 the envy of every trooper in the squadron, leading the uninitiated to wonder if he had not secured it in position by ramming a lady's bonnet pin into his red-thatched headpiece. Muldooney possessed, as was to be expected, all the admiration of his race for a pretty face, a trim figure, and a neat ankle, and had sipped the sweets of every flower (some of them terribly soiled ones) that presented itself at Aldershot or the Curragh. One could hardly call Muldooney a strictly moral man, but strong, strait-laced virtue was never one of Tommy Atkins's vices (or shall we say attributes), and he was no worse than the rest. Muldooney seemed to prefer our canteen to that in the cavalry barracks, so when he strode in, and peeped out of one eye round the marquee, with the expression of a hungry robin on the trail of a fat worm, I made him welcome, and did all I knew to assuage his insa tiable thirst. \" Whom are you in love with now, Mu'clooney?\" Instead of laughing at my question he looked so grave as he took a suck at his clay before answering, that I was astonished. \" Mother av Hivvin, 'tis no laffin matter, Corp'ril,\" he said.

One evening about twenty av us, under White, who was acting- sergeant now, we being short of non coms., an' a young sub. fresh out from home, was sent forward to reconnoitre an' bring back any inflammation we cud. Our orders was not to get shot if we cud help it, but cut back into camp if we came across the bloom- ing many. \" We was creeping along spread out like a fan, dash ing most remarkable quick whenever we came into the open, an' was about a mile from camp, when all of a sudden there was maybe a dozen flashes straight ahead, where there was a low mud wall.

So I sez, ' By all the saints then I'll make you,' an' I hit him a ' sock- dologer ' on the sconce with my sword-guard that made him conclude to lie down ; then I picked him up an' chucked him over my pummel an' skipped for camp.

THE GOLDEN CALF. He was a very good-looking youngster, with curly golden hair, huge blue eyes, ten thousand a year, and a title. He was quite girlish in appearance, with pink and white cheeks, small hands and feet, and a faint diffidence in speech, which those who did not know him put down to shyness. When he joined our regiment thc duty- of introducing him to the other fellows fell upon me, who, having been six months in the regi ment, considered myself an old stager. We had been together at Eton and at Sandhurst, and, though I was only one year his senior in age, I had already passed my military matriculation, while Cecil Carruthers had all that kind of thing before him. His father and our colonel had been chums at school, and had had some pretty rough times together in '54, so it was only natural that Carruthers should join his late father's old regiment. His record at Eton was very good. He was in the eleven and the boat in his last term, and passed into Sandhurst, and out too, with plenty in hand. AVe had not met for a couple of years, and when he turned up at my quarters I was rather disgusted to find he had not aged a bit. \" Put that youngster into a turn-down collar and Eton jacket, and, by Gad, it would suit him!\" I said to myself. \"What will"], [27, "The Golden Calf. 13 ' Grandpa ' (the Colonel) say ? \" I presented him first of all to my chum Dennis O'Connor, the senior sub., a rough Irishman ; and Carruthers, who I thought would be overawed by Dennis's bronzed face and general brusquerie of manner, was not as much impressed as he should have been. When Dennis had left my quarters and gone off to see the Major, his well-covered ribs shaking with laughter, I asked Carruthers what he thought of him. He flushed a little at my direct question. \" Not much at present,\" he said gently ; \" but I dare say he'll improve on acquaintance.\" There was consternation at mess when my protege appeared, and the only man, except tho Colonel, who put himself out of the way to be civil to him was Forrester, the junior major. \" Looks bad for Carruthers,\" said Dennis to me as we adjourned to the billiard-room. \" If Forrester has designs on that youth's purse, God help him.\" A sentiment which I endorsed. \" Shall we give him the straight tip ? \" he added \" That youngster has got his head screwed on most preternaturally straight,\" I observed. \"I know him well. Let him find out things for himself.

Forrester was known, I fear, as a fortune hunter, and fished occasionally in very troubled waters. Carruthers had not been in the regiment a month before he was christened \" The Golden Calf,\" and when, as he was bound to do, he heard of his nick name, he never troubled his head about it, in fact he chuckled. He was soon on terms of intimacy with the Major, avid Dennis, who was really a splendid fellow at heart, determined to sound the note of warning he had decided upon some time before. Carruthers, he, and I were lounging in the billiard room after mess, when Dennis said, in that absurd tone which always conveys that there is more meant than meets the ear \u2014 \" How do you get on with the Major ? \" \" Oh, he's a good sort,\" replied Carruthers, darting a quick glance at him. \" I like him : he is the only man who was civil to me, except yourselves, when I joined, and he knows some of my people.\" \"Well, take care, Cherub\" (Cherub was his sub sidiary title), \" he's a queer chap.\" \" Oh, vou mean about being hard up, and so on?\" said Carruthers, flushing slightly. \" You don't mean to say he has been borrowing money from you ? \" said Dennis incautiously. The Calf paused before answering, and the pupils of his eyes grew like pin-points as he said \u2014 \" My dear fellow, if the Major had borrowed money from me ho would hardly want the whole regiment"], [30, "16 Through a Field Glass. taken into his confidence.\" This was one for Dennis, who was an old woman for gossip. \" I am sorry to seem ungrateful, as I am sure your curiosity is only meant for my good, but I can look after myself. Have a brandy and soda ? \" Dennis roared. \" Shake, Cherub,\" he said, and they shook. A year passed with nothing to mark it, except that we were moved to Blankton, which was only ten miles from Carruthers's place. The Calf was probably the most popular man in the regi ment, and had taken a grip of his duties in no time at all. Hc came bounding into mess one evening, after a few days' leave, looking so absurdly happy that the Colonel groaned aloud, and even Forrester looked politely disgusted. \" Of course the young ass is in love, and my best subaltern\" (complimentary to us!) \"will get married and cut the service,\" said Gran'pa to the Adjutant in a stage whisper. I am afraid Carruthers found the atmosphere rather chilling, and subsided into himself, looking rather puzzled, but when he came into the smoking-room after grand rounds he seemed glad to find O'Connor and myself in our usual corner. \"Congratulate me, you fellows,\" he said, with a boyish gush of laughter, \"she's accepted me, and I'm an engaged man ! What'll you take?\" O'Connor got up to ring the bell, and I busied myself with a fresh cigar which took a lot of lighting. \" I congratulate you,\" said Dennis as he resumed his seat. \" Who is she ? and when is it to be ? \""], [31, "The Golden Calf. 17 \" First of all we'll have a bottle,\" said the Calf as the mess waiter entered. \" Now fill up and drink to \u2014 Lady Violet Carey!\" \" Good Lord !\" said Dennis, and put down his glass.

You can't say a word against her !\" \" Sit down,\" said O'Connor, \" and don't get excited. First of all, she is old enough to be your mother.\" \" She's twenty- three.\" \" And you are ?.\" \" Twenty-three.\" \" Just so ; and you are awfully in love with each other and all that kind of thing, of course.\" The Calf blushed uncomfortably. \" Yes. I'm awfully spoony, of course. You fellows arc trying to pull my leg, aren't you?\" He laughed, but there was an odd little catcli in liis voice. \" Here, you explain things to the Cherub, Treherne,\" said Dennis, sitting down plump.

The Calf paused for a moment, and then his eye was caught by a locket hanging round his friend's neck. It was a plain gold locket, with the initials V. C. in brilliants. The boy gave a sort of choke, and then, pulling him self together, he threw the invitation card on the table and stole quietly out. In due course we all turned up at Lady- Carrnthers's ball, and rarely in my pretty exhaustive experience have 1 seen things better done. The floor was perfect, music as good as could be, and the spacious ball-room crammed with the prettiest girls in Kent. Lady Car ruthers was a sweet- voiced, fair-haired woman, exactly like her son in appearance and manner, even down to the little hesitating drawl, and we subs, metaphorically fell at her feet. Lady Violet was a tall, dark girl, who looked all her twenty-three years, and possessed the most perfect pro file I think I ever saw. She was pale, calm, and impassive; but there were slumbering fires in her dark eyes that suggested infinite possibilities of love and passion if called forth by the right man. One could see that the Calf worshipped her, but she never seemed to unbend, even to him. A little later I saw her dancing with Forrester, and I felt glad I was not the Calf.

I made him sit down again. \" He's not that kind,\" I remarked- \" If he is going to have an explanation with Forrester we have no right to interfere.\" A man's voice came from a neighbouring thicket, and it was familiar to both of us. \" Then, darling, I must say good-bye \u2014 a long good bye for all our lives.

As Lindsay has said, Beevor is a notorious flirt, but he generally hunts bis game, or big fortunes, which is about the same thing. In the present instance the quarry was a Miss Graham, a friend of Lady Violet's, wdio in addition to other advantages, such as beauty, possessed the solid benefits to be derived from a fortune of a hundred thousand pounds. Therefore Beevor lost no time in entering the contest for this prize in the matrimonial market, and looked like winning all over till y-our humble servant appeared upon the scene.\" \" Conceited little monkey,\" Dennis growled. \" Begging your pardon, Dennis, Beevor is not little, and he is far too handsome for a monkey,\" rejoined the"], [47, "A Hansom (?)

Hence both Forrester and Lady A^iolet were afraid that he would carry the citadel by storm and elope with the heiress, which would have been awkward for Ladv Ariolet, who had been acting as her chaperon.\" \" Then presumably she would not have been unwilling to elope,\" I suggested. \" Then, my dear Treherne, you should never presume about what you know nothing, namely, the feminine mind, since society has presumed that the experienced Beevor has been duped by an innocent debutante just out of the schoolroom, though I must say that Miss Innocence kept up the joke till the last moment, and did not even mention it to her bosom friend, Lady Violet, else I should have had nothing to do with it. Indeed, when Lady Violet spoke to her about the flirta tion she got angry, and, judging from what Forrester told me, there must have been a nice little skirmish between them. I may add that Forrester, with the virtue of a newly married man, was as angry with Beevor as his wife was with Miss Graham.\" \" So much for the prologue, which Forrester told me over a cigar at the Junior.

As for myself, I regarded Beevor and Lady Alolet as forbidden topics of conversation, though it was not long before I was able to discover that the former had not relinquished his feelings of revenge. \u00a9 O One morning, during the middle of October, when I was wondering how I should get through the day, the Calf came to me with the proud face of an inventor AA-ho has just found out a new way of killing time. \" I have just had a note from that horse-dealing farming fellow Whippet. He's got some gees he wants us to look at. I told him some two or three weeks ago to let me know if he had got anything that would suit me, so let's driA'e OA-er after lunch and inspect the animals.\" \"Very well; though my own stud is quite large enough both for my requirements and my purse.\" \" Then you will be able to give a candid opinion, and not condemn the pick of the lot because you want it for yourself.\" Accordingly at three o'clock Carruthers's smart dog cart dashed up to the door of Pelham Lodge, and at the same moment appeared in the doorway the tall form of Jim AVhippet, steeplechase jockey, farmer, and horse-dealer. \"Afternoon, my lord. Tom ! \" he called to a diminu tive individual in a sleeved Avaistcoat, who had made his appearance from the vicinity of the stables at the sound of Avheels, \" take his lordship's mare out, give her a drink of meal and water and some corn afterwards.\" Then Whippet led the way into a cosy sitting-room, from the windows of which we could see the paddocks,"], [55, "\" Vixen.\" 41"], [56, "Through a Field Glass. 42 over Which the owner had arranged a small steeplechase course. \"Now, Whippet,\" began the Calf, when he had finished a glass of genuine October, \"let's have a look at these prodigies of horseflesh. \" Some five or six horses Avere brought out for our inspection, anj-one of which would have been cheap at two hundred ; but the Calf kneAV the ways of horse-dealers. \" Come, AVhippet, bring out the pick of the stable, for I suppose you've got something in the background capable of winning the Grand National.\" \" I don't know about that, my lord, but I have got the best six-j-ear-old mare that ever entered these stables.

Here she is. A picture to look at, but a fiend for temper.\" I have never seen in my life such a perfectly-made hunter as this mare was, but even in the stable-yard she betrayed her vice by kicking and attempting to bite the la I who had charge of her. But the Calf only looked at her with admiration, and said \u2014 44 I think, Whippet, I'll throw a leg across her.\" \"As you like, my -lord, but remember, though she may be quiet enough now, she has the character of bein\"' unmanageable with hounds.\" \u00a9 \u00a9 The mare was saddled, and the Calf rode her towards the paddocks, where be took her over a few fences.

I didn't know her history till after sho Avas sent down here, or I wouldn't haA'e had her in the stable.\" Unfortunately there is no such stubborn pride as the pride of horsemanship. Remonstrance and persuasion Avere thrown away upon the Calf, and at the end of half an hour he Avas the possessor of the handsome dangerous brute, after certain preliminaries, whieh, briefly stated, were as folloAvs : \u2014 First: the price was considerably lower than I had expected. This removed all suspicion from AVhippet of \"tickling\" the Calf's pride, so as to cause him to give a big figure. Second: AVhippet Avas selling the mare on commission for a certain Jack Maylor, a horse-dealer at St. John's Wood, who had bought her at Tattersall's. Third : the aforesaid Jack Maylor w-as not renowned for his honesty, so Whippet had inquired about the past history of the mare. One of her former owners, a Avell known hard rider in Leicestershire, had considered her too vicious to ride, and had sold her for stud purposes. Her purchaser, for financial reasons, had been obliged to sell all his horses at Tattersall's, where, as she Avas not in foal, she was classed as a hunter. \" You've made a nice purchase,\" I remarked to the Calf as Ave drove back to barracks. \" You've bought an animal which one of the best horsemen in England,"], [59, "\" Vixen.\" 45 aa-Iio has ridden the winner of the Grand National, considers unsafe to ride.\" \" Which means that you consider me one of the AA-orst horsemen in England. Look here, Sobersides, I intend to ride that mare on the opening day. AVild horses shan't make me change my mind, so there's an end of it.\" I could say nothing more, and though Dennis's leave would be up before the opening day, I knew that where I had failed he would not be likely to succeed. So many sporting pens have been dipped in cheery ink to describe \" the first Monday in November\" that I must not weary my reader by tacking on another account to the already OA-erwhehning mass of hunting literature. Suffice it to say that we of the th Lancers had been more abstemious than usual over night, and on the eventful morning felt fit to ride for the honour of the regiment. The Brightemall pack at that time was popularly called \" The cut-em-down-and hang-em-up-to-dry \" Hounds, and the members boasted that \" The cream of tho cream in the shire of shires \" would have to ride all they knew to be able to keep in the first flight, so that even I, Avhom the regiment irreverently called \" Sobersides,\" felt my pulse beat unusually quick as I swung myself into the saddle. It Avas onlv four miles to the meet, but those four miles Avere sufficient to prove to me that the Calf and the chestnut mare, whom he had appropriately named \" Arixen,\" were not on the best of terms Avith each other. A few bucks at starting might be regarded"], [60, "46 Through a Field Glass. more as play than vice, but from the persistent way in which she laid her head down and bored at the bit, I saw that the Calf would have to ride with great \u00a9 judgment, o thei' wise the m a r o would be come quite unmanage able. Un fortunately, judgment w as what the Calf ( lacked on horseback ; he had a firm seat and light hands, but no head.

As I struggled to establish my plaee in the first flight I noticed the Calf, Avho always ignored gates, take Vixen OA-er tbe post and rails out of coA'ert into the open. After Avitnessing this performance, which was equally creditable to man and horse, I sat down to do and ride my best; and as I saw the sterns of the hindmost hounds disappear through the blackthorn at the end of the first field, I must confess that 1 forgot all about the existence of the Calf and A'ixen. Even now I can remember the panorama which spread itself out before me after I had negotiated the blackthorn.

I neither saw nor cared about what was on the further side, for Pegasus himself could not have cleared the obstacle, though Vixen was rushing at it with the speed of an express train. \" Throw yourself off, \" I shouted, but the Calf did not hear me. My head became dizzy as I watched the mad mare get nearer and nearer to the impossible leap. But the Calf's pluck did not desert him.

For a moment, whieh seemed an hour, it looked as if he had been successful.

I must make my story short so far as the Calf's accident Avas concerned. A sporting doctor, avIio Avas quickly on the scene, found his leg was broken and there A\\rere several severe contusions. As to Vixen, she had paid the penalty for her own vice. Her back was broken, and a friendly bullet ended her earthly career.

The day's racing started with a small hurdle race and a hunters' selling flat race. Then after an interval of forty-five minutes the seA-enteen competitors for the big raee of the day left the paddock and Avere soon under the starter's orders.

Sir Beavis was going strong, and the pen cillers Avould not lay more than five to two. The Calf for once in his life Avas riding with judgment, and I Avatched him with admiration as he steadied his mount for the dangerous drop fence, which he negotiated safely. Not so the others. A cry of \" they're down \" went up from the Ring, and it was evident there had been a break-neck spill. \"Which are they?\" was the question on everybody's lips, and in a few seconds the answer came, \" Pioneer, Mirth, and Railroad.\" I glanced at Lady Violet, who Avas as pale as death. \" I'll go down and see if he's hurt,\" I said reassur ingly, though my glasses had already told me that the accident Avas a nasty one, for Mirth had jumped on to the top of Pioneer, and both horses had rolled over the unfortunate Forrester.

He never seemed to recognise the fact that he Avas \"having his leg pulled,\" but sat there in an easy chair, his grey, sleepy eyes half closed, and lied imperturbably, unconsciously, Avithout hesitation, and Avithout haste, with a consistency that inspired respect and almost carried conviction.

Now immediately after an attempt being made to put his bridle over his ears, the horse threw out his heels and kicked the plaintiff's groom in the left eye. I should add, my dear Treherne, that the nasty brute might have kicked the groom in the right eye, but he had lost that optic while shooting wild ducks in Lincolnshire, which, as I pointed out to the jury, is a dangerous and unprofitable pursuit. Then the plaintiff, acting with superlative wisdom and deep fore thought, tried to put a collar on the horse ; but the animal, actuated by some incomprehensible motive, bit the plaintiff in the seat of his trousers, and his teeth, unfortunately for the comfort of the plaintiff, pene trated .through the cloth.

Norah spent the morning wandering restlessly up and down the garden Avith her baby, peeping over the trim box hedge which lined the road. She laughed at their reflection in the large pond at the foot of the garden, checkered Avith the sun-rays filtering through the interlacing boughs. \" Aren't Ave swells, baby ? \" she laughed, as the child stretched out its plump little arms towards the white lilies. \" All in white, with blue sashes, little one; won't papa be surprised at our finery ? \" The sound of hoofs made her turn, and Foster, her husband's groom, rode up to the hedge.

Norah felt the chill of fear seize her heart, but laughed it away, and seating herself on the marble balustrade surrounding the pond, first kissed the super scription and then opened her letter. It contained simply a cutting from a newspaper, wliich ran as follows : \u2014 \" A certain lord seems determined to provide society Avith plenty of gossip this season.

The tragic end of Lady Sturton, following so closely on Dennis's pathetic story, had given a sad turn to the bent of my mind, and I longed for something to happen to enliven my spirits.

But I had not the slightest idea what the result of our con versation would be. Within two days I had a note from Mrs. Lindsay. \" My dear Captain Treherne, \" I will introduce you to the happy hunting ground. Get leave for a week, and act as my cavalier to Talton Towers.

I Avas rather alarmed at my own temerity in going to Talton Towers professedly to look for a wife, but as I fondly imagined no one but charming Mrs. Lindsay Avas aware of my intention I felt less nervous than perhaps I might have done under other circumstances. I was told off to take a Aliss Agnew in to dinner, and as I had no doubt that this Avas the lady Airs. Lindsay had destined for me, I surveyed her Avith more than usual attention. She Avas tall, fair, with that pink and white skin that speaks of good health, and her hair Avas of a crinkly russet brown of the hue of autumn leaves almost.

Result, I got moody, ill-tempered, and snappish, \u2022while she seemed to get paler and thinner every day. Afr.s. Lindsay could give me very little help, and was annoyed with the poor girl. \" I Avill speak to her,\" she said, biting her lips. \" I would far rather you did not,\" I urged. \" There's something wrong somewhere.\" \" Surely she has never caused tongues to Avag ! \" \" She had a tremendous flirtation Avith Young, ofthe \u2014 th last season, but he is in India now.\" \" I have certainly never heard a word against her.\" \" I should think not indeed.\" A week later Mrs. Lindsay joined me on the terrace, and we took two or three turns up and down ; she was very agitated. \" Pack up and go,\" she said curtly. \" What has happened ? \" I asked. \" You must think no more of Alice Agnew.\" \" I must know first \" \" I tell you it is of no use thinking any more of her.\" \" I Avill go if you insist upon it, Mrs. Lindsay, but I will have an explanation Avith Alice first.\" \" Then God help you.\" For the first time in my life I was angry with the Major's wife.

I was staying for a few days with an old school chum named Randal Egerton at his shooting box in Meadowshire, when, to my surprise, I met Sturton at a dinner part}' at the house of Sir John Leslie, a Avell-known sporting baronet. He seemed perfectly oblivious of tho scandal which Avas attached to his name, and greeted me as an old acquaintance. He even had the audacity to ask after the Calf. \" I suppose Carruthers has quite settled down into married life. I saw that he spoke in the Gilded Chamber the other night.\" \u00a9 \"Yes,\" I replied curtly. \"Lady Sturton is not here, I perceive.\" \"No; I fancy she's at Monte Carlo,\" was the care less rejoinder. The dinner was excellent, the dry port perfect, and Sir John a good host, though his conversation chiefly consisted of stable slang. Before the ladies retired I saw that Egerton was in love Avith Lucy Leslie, Sir John's only child ; but, as he had said nothing to me, I could not judge how far matters had progressed."], [187, "Lost to the Turf. 167 Lord Sturton had come as the guest of a Air. Jervis, to whom I took a dislike at first sight. He was evidently not quite a gentleman, and resembled a prosperous horse-dealer struggling into society more than anything else I can think of; while, if he Avere strictly honest, he ought to have brought an action for libel against his countenance. After the ladies had left the dining-room, the forth coming hunt steeplechase was all that we men could talk about, and Sturton, who had a horse entered called \" The Don,\" remarked that Jervis was going to ride for him. \" I see, Sir John,\" he continued, \"that they make your horse and mine equal favourites. Now, I'll back ' The Don ' against ' Belle ' for a level thousand, pro vided ' Belle ' is ridden by some gentleman here.\" Besides Egerton, there were only two men present capable of riding in the race, and both of them had entered horses of their oavii. Sir John was a confirmed gambler, and looked with a mute appeal at Egerton, who nodded assent. So the bet was duly booked. A big bet certainly to be made over the mahogany ; but then I had heard that the mortgages on Sir John's \u00a9 \u00a9 estates proved that he Avas in the habit of making big bets and of losing them. Egerton was in a very bad temper as Ave drove home. He was a hard man to hounds, but his experience of steeplechasing was confined to \" point to point \" races, and he knew that he should have to submit to a severe course of training.

Unfortunate gambling, lavish hospitality, and extravagant living have brought him perilously near thc Bankruptcy Court.

Other men might possess as firm a seat and as light hands as he had, but few had such a Avonderful knowledge of the capabilities of a horse. Even when he had never seen his mount before the saddling bell rang, instinct seemed to tell him when to race and when to save his horse. \" How does Tipster ride ? \" a tyro on the turf once asked. \" AVith his head \" Avas the curt reply, and A-olumes could not ha\\-e said more. Besides being a first-rate jockey, he Avas a keen judge of a horse, and Egerton knew that Avhen he had seen \" Belle \" jump her fences he could give him the best advice as to how to ride her.

Egerton stuck hard to bis trainiiiLr, which he found \u00a9 <-_ 7 more pleasant than he had anticipated, for Miss Leslie took as keen an interest in the result of the race as he did himself, so that I often found myself de trop.

They had evidently finished their business, for I could distinctly hear the last words. \" Remember !

Blank has made him a higher bid, and he has accepted it.\" \" A case of ' the biter bit.' \" \" Exactly ; but I shouldn't say anything about it if I were you.\" The Meadowshire Hunt Steeplechases did not differ in any important essential from the ordinary class of country hunt meetings. There was the small stand with the ring in front, where the sporting farmers invested their sovereigns and half-sovereigns, while from the drags and carriages rano-ed along the rails \u00a9 \u00a9 O \u00a9 the male occupants would rush to make their bets, and then hurry back to their fair companions, aa-1io were doing their best to fill their glo\\'e-boxes. But this year the gathering AA'as unusually large. The story of Sturton's bet had extended beyond the county. It had been published in the sporting papers, and been dis cussed in clubland. So many gentlemen of the pencil and habitual racegoers had come down to Meadowshire, who in former years Avould not ha\\re gone five miles to attend the meeting. Both \"Belle\" and \"The Don\" looked in perfect condition in the paddock, and though there were thir teen starters, it seemed as if the race would resolve itself into a match between the two favourites. But now one of those events happened which only those experienced in the movements of the ring can under stand. \" Belle \" and \" The Don \" had both started equal favourites in the betting, but though it was"], [192, "Through a Field Glass. 172 apparent that the punters fancied \" The Don,\" yet the bookmakers Avere never tired of laying against him, and, instead of advancing, his price slowly but surely receded. At first thc odds were six to four against him, but he gradually went back till Mr. Blank's stentorian voice could be heard shouting, \"Here! Six to one against ' The Don.' Shall I put it down in thousands, my lord.\" Sturton said nothing, but his face showed signs of great uneasiness. There was a screw loose somewhere, and on this occasion he Avas evidently out of the swum. But the horses had gone to the post, and the cry went up \" They're off.\" For the first three fields there was no material difference in the order of running. ''Belle\" and \"The Don\" were held back, and the"], [193, "Lost to the Turf. 1 73 others Avere nearly level. But as they neared the fourth fence \u2014 a stiffish bull-finch \u2014 Ned Davis pulled in his mount till he was hardly a length in front of \" The Don,\" who was on the lest, while Egerton on \" Belle \" was on the right. The leaders negotiated the obstacle in safety, and that morbid portion of the crowd which is always on the look out for accidents began to feel disappointed. But the disappointment did not last long. Davis's horse refused, and swerved suddenly round to the left. Jervis had no time to stop. There Avas a crash, and then all that could be seen was a confused mass of two horses and one man rolling in the ditch on the taking-off side of the fence, for Davis, with a skill which would haA'e ensured him an engagement at a \u00a9 \u00a9 circus, had, as his horse swerved, neatly cut a voluntary and landed safely on the far side. \" Two down.\" \" The Don is down.\" \" Evens Belle.\" Jervis had fallen underneath his horse, and when Avith some difficulty he Avas extricated, it was discoA-ered that his collar-bone Avas broken. Meanwhile Davis. pretending to be much shaken, had limped back to the Aveighing-room vrith the assistance of a groom who happened to be close by. \" It's all over now bar shouting. Egerton wins in \u00a9 \u00a9 a canter,\" Tipster said to me. But Tipster Avas wrong. Certainly Egerton Avon the race, though not in a common canter. But the cross 7 O Avas so apparent that Ned DaA\"is was \" carpeted\" by the stewards and asked to give an explanation of his riding.

He accordingly stated"], [194, "Through a Field Glass. 174 that he had been bribed by Lord Sturton to cross \" Belle,\" and impudently added that he got flurried and crossed the wrong horse. He referred the stewards to his bankers to prove that Sturton had paid him two hundred pounds. A few days afterwards, with com mendable prudence, he transferred himself to the Anti podes, and doubtless became a prominent figure on the Australian turf. Nor did he go alone ; he was accom panied by Lady Sturton, who brought with her as much portable property as she could lay her hands upon. I may at once state that the matter was reported to the National Hunt Committee and to the Jockey Club, with the result that Lord Sturton Avas warned off the turf. My personal interest in the race terminated with a visit to Hunt and Roskell, for my chum won the race and a wife at the same time."], [195, "CHAPTER XVIII. CURTAIN. It may interest the reader to hear a few more words with regard to some of my old mess companions.
