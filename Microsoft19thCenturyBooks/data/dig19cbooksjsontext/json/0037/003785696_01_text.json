We 're at winter's age, my friend, And gray is now our hair. But in our hearts lives vet A summer warmth to spare. Yes, summer warmth to spare, my friend For many, many years. P. Hansen. Letter from Mr. Hans Tyssen, of New York, to the Amtmand, Oscar Nordal, Nordal, Nordby, Norway. Honoured Friend, Tour letters are not frequent, but when they do reach us they are welcome. The simplest thing you write to us about our fatherland is dear to us, and not the less"], [14, "2 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. so that you write in Norse. The sustained interest you have felt during thirty-five years for the friend of your youth has led to a desire to keep fresh in our minds the language of gamle Norge. This, too, has been tbe more easy from the number of Scandinavians coming to us as assistants and servants. , Many come with your recom mendation, and they are those that awaken an interest in myself and wife. We are glad to see them, and we are grateful to think that we have assisted so many to inde pendent and happy positions. This thought has been a comfort to us. They have, however, repaid us a hundred fold, for they have brought with them their kindly Norse natures. When one or the other has left us I have felt the same feeling as when I saw Norway for the last time from the ship's deck, now thirty-five years ago. I have for years longed to return to Norway, and die there; but my wife has become accustomed to her life and sur roundings here, and my only son, who is now twenty-five years old, has acquired a passion for travel, which, of course, time will cool. He has also many English acquaintances, who talk much of the way the English sports of fishing and shooting are conducted. Of late he has been interested in a book by an American called Prime, entitled I go a-Fishing. I have read the book and to a young fresh mind like his there is much in it to attract. He has his rooms full of English books on similar subjects, and, his mind being so occupied, it has"], [15, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 3 been impossible for me to get him to like the dry tech nical business at which I have so long slaved to make money. Although I cannot leave the business, my son can ; and I have advised him to visit Norway, and come back with a wife from his father's people, and then settle down, as he must do, as an American citizen. He can speak Norse, not very perfectly, but reads it with ease. My wife, who sees what I now write, says that I should state his name is Harild, as heretofore, in writing to you, I have always called him \"my son.\" He is named after his mother's father, a man we remember with respect and affection. Harild has never had any desire for haunting the bars of hotels or public places of amusement ; and, from having so many English acquaintances, he has been influenced by them, and we think his cast of thought more English than American. He has visited most places of interest in the States, and his mind is now turned towards Europe. My wife has suggested that, if you would receive him at your house for a few weeks, your advice and assistance would help him to see and know our fatherland as it should be seen and known. In this I fully concur. We could not allow you to bear the expense and trouble which we know your kindness would undertake too willingly without recognition ; therefore, if you will receive him as my wife suggests, I will send you a draft on the bank at Bergen. By a life of money getting and few expenses, I am now rich, and can make 1 *"], [16, "4 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. him a liberal allowance, and I hope you will let me have my own way, as you did when we were boys together. My wife greets you heartily, and so does your friend, Hans Ttssen. Amtmanden Nordal to Mr. Hans Tyssen, of New York. Esteemed Friend, Your letter has interested me, and, for my part, your son can come here when he pleases, and he shall experience all the kindness and assistance in my power. But if your letter has interested me, for the rest of my family the explosion of a shell could not have caused more excitement. My wife Amalie, whose life hitherto has been like a lake on a summer day, is now in a wave of excitement, and my three daughters, Emilie, Sophie, and Olava no less so. Their ages range from twenty to twenty-four, and hitherto very few or any suitors have appeared. For myself, I know of none, although my wife has suggested and suggested ; but I have thought it best to let this rest in God's hand, and for His will to shape their futures. For two days I could not get my wife to consider the matter calmly, or to let me send you our reply. I asked what objection could there be in serving an old friend of one's early days ? No, there was no objection ; but then \u2014 he might wish to marry one of the"], [17, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 5 girls. To this I replied that when there were three princesses the young prince always married the youngest, and that would be Olava. I was then told that I could not be expected to understand the subject, and that to joke about it made matters worse. The fluster in the hen-roost has subsided, but it has occurred to me that you may have forgotten that I have three daughters of marriageable ages. This might influence you, and I par ticularly point it out, as your letter states you wish your son to take a wife from his father's people. For my part, I do not see that my daughters are other than Norwegian ladies of their class, or that there is anything specially or dangerously attractive about them. They are very much like other young women. I should not suggest anything, or assist in any setting of caps ; as these matters, I think, had better be left to grow, or not to grow, as a wiser will than ours directs. Let your son come, by all means, if such be your wish ; but in one thing you will not have your own way, and that is that I do not agree to your offer to send money, when I can do you a small service. I do not want it, for one thing, and, for another, I will not have it. It is neither well nor necessary for you to press this point, and I hope you will give me the pleasure of doing anything I can for you without this. If your son comes, I advise his going to Liverpool, thence to Hull, and by steamer to Bergen, where I will"], [18, "6 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. meet him. I would rather have him here without his staying in England. My reason, perhaps, is not the wisest, but we have so many English in Norway who behave in an eccentric manner that I would rather he came direct across to us, if he is to come at all. You say he has English notions ; there are some which I hope he will not pick up ; and this is my reason for his not remaining in England. My wife greets you, and my daughters also ; and they all, in conclusion, decide to say they shall be glad to see your son Harild. Live well. Your friend, Oscar Nordal."], [19, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 7 CHAPTER II. Hil dig, norske By, Bergen aldrig ny ; Gammeldags og evig som din Holbergs Lune. Hail to thee, Norse town, Bergen never new ; Old-fashioned, yet eternal, like thy Holberg's humour. BJ0EN8TJEENE BJ0ENSON. There are few places more beautiful than Bergen, when approaching it from the North Sea, up the Fjord. The white houses with their red-tiled roofs appear diminutive ; and the contrast of the green Fjeld-grass and the gray primary rocks is strong, yet picturesque. A sense of purity is suggested both by the stillness of the Fjord and by the clear colours of Bergen and its surroundings. This feeling may be soon dissipated by the constant rain and bad drainage, on a nearer acquaintance ; but the view once seen, on approaching Bergen, seldom leaves the memory. Harild Tyssen was on the deck of the English steamer"], [20, "8 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. at 6 o'clock in the morning, as she anchored near the custom-house at Bergen. It was the latter end of May. The steamer was boarded by many persons, and amongst them by the Amtmand, Herr Oscar Nordal, to whom Harild Tyssen was soon pointed out. \" Welcome to gamle Norge,\" said the Amtmand ; \" I am Oscar Nordal, your father's friend.\" \"I am very glad to know you, Sir,\" said Tyssen, as they shook hands and regarded each other with curiosity. \" It is Hans Tyssen over again ; but a thinner man, with a strange and foreign look,\" said the Amtmand ; \" your eyes are like Hans Tyssen's, but he had not that yellow moustache, and his features were not so clear cut ; but it gladdens my heart to see you, and welcome to me is the son of my friend.\" \" Thank you a thousand times,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" you make me expect a good time.\" \"But we have no time to spare now,\" added the Amtmand ; \" the little Fjord steamer starts in less than an hour, and your baggage must be passed through tbe Customs and put on board.\" \" So your letter, that I got at Hull, informed me,\" said Tyssen, \" but the steward of the English steamer has undertaken to arrange all that. I travel with little luggage, and, if I want anything, I buy it wherever I am ; but we have now forty minutes to see Bergen, and can see it all in that time.\""], [21, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 9 \" That is American,\" said the Amtmand, \" but an old fellow of fifty-five, like me, would rather not be hurried off his legs ; besides, there is too much of interest in Bergen for even an American not to give it a whole day.\" \" But we could do it,\" urged Tyssen, \" by being smart.\" \" No,\" said the Amtmand, \" not even by being smart; and I do not wish to miss the steamer for Nordby. In this older world we are slow, and fail to see the advan tage of breathless haste, without severe necessity.\" \" But,\" said Tyssen, \" we have half an hour, and by being smart might see \" \" Our Custom-house people here are slow,\" interrupted the Amtmand, \" our boatmen are slow, and I cannot miss the Fjord steamer, which I know starts punctually ; but,\" he added, on seeing Harild Tyssen'js look of disappoint ment, \" if you wish to exhibit any smartness, you shall have many chances of being smart at Nordby.\" The little Fjord steamer started a very few minutes after they were on board, and the Amtmand, seeing that Tyssen now knew that there would not have been time for sight-seeing, said : \" If we had missed this steamer, we should have had either to remain a week in Bergen, or have taken a journey partly by Kariols and partly by boats, which would have occupied two days to reach Nordby. You"], [22, "10 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. must recollect my time is not my own, and that I have already been a week in Bergen waiting to meet vou.\" \"Then I consider,\" said Tyssen, slowly, \"that this country cannot be very thickly settled about here.\" \"No,\" said the Amtmand, smiling at this American view of Norway, \"the people from this district have, however, settled in great numbers in Iowa and Minnesota. There is a continual struggle with nature here ; the Norwegian farmer lives a hard life. He has no luxuriant corn crops from fields adjoining his farm-house, easy to cultivate and rich in yield. It is only here and there in Norway where tillage affords a subsistence, to say nothing of profit. It has often been urged upon me to encourage the introduction of English agricultural implements and machinery ; but it is only in comparatively few cases that it pays or answers. The grazing on the Fjelds is what suits the people best ; or, I should say, the Norwegian farmer has to look to his cows and sheep, goats and pigs, and their produce, rather than to the soil. In some valleys there are spots of good land, but these spots are too few. It is no wonder that America has had attrac tions in her broad lands for Scandinavians ; but they emigrate with regret, and even a prosperous man like your father still feels a love for his fatherland, and a longing to see bis old home under the Fjelds.\" \" That 's so,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" and it explains how"], [23, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 11 and why I am here ; he wishes me to see Norway, and his kindly nature and goodness have given me ample time and means.\" \" We say of such a man as Hans Tyssen, that he is good i Grunden (at bottom),\" said the Amtmand, \"and I read between the lines in his letters that he is the same Hans Tyssen who wished farewell to me now thirty-five years ago.\" \" That 's a fact,\" said Harild Tyssen in his American manner. \" I thought the rocky land was higher in Norway ; but we are passing through a lot of low rounded islands. Your mentioning my father makes me recollect that he always describes the scenery about Bergen as the finest in Norway.\" \" And quite right, too,\" said the Amtmand. \" We are passing the islands on the coast ; we shall soon get into grand scenery that will keep your eyes and mind occu pied, as it is new to you. You will see narrow defiles of water edged by precipices, and expanding, as we round a cliff, into lakes ; and then again a change of scene, of wood, and rock, and water, with here and there a farm stead. Suddenly you will see a pleasant country house and a little valley, or a rattling river with a waterfall into the Fjord. When the precipices admit of it, there is the distant yet clear prospect of the snow in the higher Fjelds, that bounds the view with a bold background of wild and gigantic beauty.\""], [24, "12 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" I consider what you say is a picture,\" said Harild Tyssen ; \" but there is such a word as breakfast.\" \" You can get little on board here,\" said the Amtmand, \" but in my provision-box we shall find something ; and as you look hungry, we can open it at once.\" The Amtmand opened the wooden box in which he had, however, a good supply, as he had expected the contingency. \" You see,\" he added, \" it is not often this steamer takes passengers, other than the Bander, and they always have their provisions with them. It is true, as the summer advances, many English and Americans travel on such a boat as this, but their preparations are made accordingly. If you wanted anything now, probably you could get but little except something to drink, and that not very drinkable. You will not arrive at Nordby until six this evening, possibly later ; but my place, Nordal, is close to the landing-pier, and where you will have what my house can afford, and a welcome from my wife and family.\" \" Thank you a thousand times, Herr Amtmand,\" said Harild Tyssen ; \" I am sure of a good time. But, do you know, I do not like your objecting to my father's sending you that draft on Bergen, which he mentioned in his letter ; he said to me, ' I guess I '11 pay him out,' and he 's a determined man.\" \" That may be,\" said the Amtmand, \" but he might let"], [25, "13 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. me do him a service, if it can be called so, and that as freely as he would do it for me.\" \" I shake hands with you, Herr Amtmand,\" said Harild Tyssen, \"I already believe you are clear grit.\" \" I do not understand English or American enough to know what clear grit is,\" said the Amtmand. \" We will not argue on that, Herr Amtmand,\" said Tyssen ; \" the meaning will come round to you, like the grand picture you drew just now has to me. I have seen much ; and Norway, as I see it now, has its hard features ; but it is rarely that one sees a softer beauty contrasting with a sterner character. It interests and charms.\" \"Well put,\" said the Amtmand, who began to see that his young guest was a keen observer. \" Where were you chiefly educated ? \" he asked. \" At many places : my father's object was that I should learn a deal, and I fear I have not followed his wishes entirely,\" replied Harild Tyssen. \" You see, he wanted me to learn all the professions and all the languages of Europe ; well, I have learnt a deal, but I like the practical study of natural history. I do not care for shooting for shooting's-sake, or fishing to kill fish, but I like to know all about them, and see where and how they Uve. It teaches the lesson of a Creator's will, and how wonderful are His ways, and how the lower life dovetails into the higher. It is a grand lesson.\""], [26, "14 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. This speech gave the worthy Amtmand so much to think over, that he smoked for a while in silence and said nothing. His young American friend differed from his expectation. \" Have you been shooting and fishing much in America ? \" asked the Amtmand at length. \" Yes,\" replied Harild Tyssen. \" I have shot buffalo and the American deer and antelope, and with a rifle I am there ; but I am no great count with a shot-gun. I have killed duck and prairie-hen, and a bear or two, and turkey in Texas ; but I do not like the men I have been brought in contact with in following game in America. In trout-fishing I have met many pleasant men, and I love the old-fashioned angler, Izaak Walton. In fact, I have the old fisher's book in my pocket. It is not the fishing that interests me so much as the quaintness with which it is invested by him.\" The Amtmand's barometer of opinion of his young American friend rose. It was clear there was no thought suggested by him that was not sincere and true. \" But your father's business in New York is that of a builder, and you are to follow him in it,\" said the Amtmand. \" Yes, it is true,\" replied Tyssen, \" and his wishes I will obey. The difficulty is that, instead of bringing me up as a builder, he has educated me so that I should be of more use as a naturalist ; but I am ready to do any-"], [27, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 15 thing that he wishes. His view is that, after a time, I may alter, and it is not impossible ; if I have to earn money as a builder, I will. Where my duty lies, my in clination shall follow. My father has given me time ; and it is not only wise, but kind.\" The Amtmand smoked in silence until the pier at Nordby was in sight. He pointed to it, and said : \" There is Nordby, and, on the right, Nordal.\" Harild Tyssen looked with interest. There was a little landing-place, a little town with houses built here and there, and a large villa-like residence, surrounded with trees, and having a railed garden in front. That was Nordal. The Amtmandinde and her eldest daughter, Froken Emilie, were on the pier, and were introduced to the young American. His manner was respectful, but stiff. The Amtmandinde was a blonde, fair, stout, and fifty ; her daughter, Froken Emilie, was a younger edition. If their nature was gushing at times, it was, as a rule, calm. Exceptional circumstances might ruffle, but they would never distort, except for a time, and that time was rare. The Amtmand's residence at Nordal was a long white painted house facing the railed garden, with four windows on each side of a higher middle building, to which there were steps. There was a front hall and an inner hall, and to this inner hall many doors led to reception-rooms on the left, and at the right were the Amtmand's busi-"], [28, "16 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. ness rooms. At the rear was a quadrangle, and to the left and right of it were the domestic offices and quarters. The whole gave an impression of practical usefulness, and if there was a rough simplicity, it was clear it suited the colder climate and the wants of its occupants. \" Welcome to Nordal,\" said the Amtmand, as he stood on his threshold and addressed Harild Tyssen. \" Thank you for the good time I expect,\" replied his guest. \" These are my two other daughters, Sophie and Olava,\" said the Amtmand, presenting two tall, fair, and clear complexioned ladies to Harild Tyssen. He bowed, and said : \" I hope our acquaintance may improve the fair im pression I entertain.\" \" Now, Amalie,\" said the Amtmand, \" we are hungry, tired, and longing for something better than the cold provisions and Baiersk beer and claret that my provision box was supplied with at Bergen. An American is accustomed to eat more than he can digest, so give us more than we can digest, and that now.\" \" Everything is ready,\" said the Amtmandinde. \" We saw the steamer coming up the Fjord, and all is ready as soon as you are.\" The dinner was simple and sufficient, and arranged so well by the Amtmand's wife and daughters, attending on him and his guest, that Harild Tyssen, whose experiences"], [29, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 17 of American life were so different, felt he was being treated like a god in a heathen temple. He sprang up repeatedly to assist, but what he would do was already done. There was nothing for him but to satisfy his hunger and be pleasant. \" Now,\" said the Amtmand, \" let us go out in the ante room, it is too cold yet for the verandah, and let us dis cuss your plans as we smoke and coffee is being served.\" \" And how did you leave your parents, Mr. Tyssen ? \" asked Fru Nordal. \" I have never seen your father, although I have heard so much about him.\" \" Thank you, Fru Nordal,\" replied Harild Tyssen, \" they are well ; my father always has his best time when he is much occupied. He interests himself especially in the Scandinavians who come into our house, and in his business his mind is much occupied as to how he can assist them to maintain themselves after they have been with us a short time. His experience is valuable to them.\" \"A good and kind thing to do,\" said Fru Nordal. \" And your mother ? \" \" Is the same,\" replied Tyssen. \" Their thoughts are ever one, and she suggests much to my father, often of use and smart.\" The three Frokener Nordal now came in, and Harild Tyssen rose from his chair and stood at some distance from it to give either of them an opportunity to take it, 2"], [30, "18 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. if they chose. They, however, sat at a little distance, behind their mother, joining in the conversation occa sionally. \" Now, what is your programme, Mr. Tyssen ? \" asked the Amtmand. \" My father's wish is that I should see Norway ; but first to stay with you a short time, to get your advice and to perfect myself a little more in the language,\" replied Harild Tyssen, with the business-like manner that always appeared habitual to him. \"Yes, but you said something about fishing, and so did your father in his letter to us,\" said the Amtmand. \" It is just the season for salmon here ; trout are a little later. The rivers in Norway are, as a rule, let to English men for terms of years.\" \" Yes, there were several on board the Hull steamer, with their rods and impedimenta ; and pleasant men, too,\" added Tyssen ; \" there was a man called Stirling, who said he fished a river near Nordby. I think the Vange Elv, he called it, and said he had done so for many years. He spoke Norsk in a broken way ; a man about thirty.\" \" Oh yes ! we all know Mr. Stirling,\" said Freken Olava Nordal. \" Such a funny man ! He o-enerally wears a check tweed suit, with trousers that come to a lump at the knee.\" \" And such boots, laced up with hooks and shod with"], [31, "19 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. iron !\" joined in Froken Sophie; \"and when he walks about our wooden houses everyone can hear his resonant tread.\" \"But the funniest thing of all is his hat,\" chimed in Fraken Emilie. \" It is decorated with pieces of cork and hooks and eyes, to which he attaches those feathered things, in the imitation of butterflies, that he uses for catching salmon.\" \" People laugh at him, when they see him in his absurd dress ; but he is not a bad fellow,\" said Fru Nordal. \" But he is like other English, very eccentric,\" said the Amtmand. \" He belongs to some climbing club in Lon don, and ascends the highest Fjelds, and dangerous ones, too. Last year he ascended an almost inaccessible peak, with Ole Nystad as guide. They went up from Nystad, where Ole lives. In the afternoon, about 4 o'clock, Nystad came rushing down the Fjeld, and said that Herr Stirling was on the highest peak, nearly at the top, but where he could neither go up nor come down, and that someone must go up the Fjeld with a rope to assist him. Sleeping at such a height would most likely end in death before morning. It was with difficulty that a strong active man called Jorgen was induced to ascend the Fjeld to Mr. Stirling's assistance. When Jm-gen came up, Mr. Stir ling was winding up his watch, as if he was going to bed, and the first thing he said was, ' There is a fine view from here, Jergen.' By fastening the rope to each other's 2 *"], [32, "20 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. waists, and by careful management, they got to a place of safety, after hours of danger. The first thing Mr. Stir ling did was to brush his clothes with his hand, that had naturally become soiled, and to scold Jergen for forgetting to bring up a clothes-brush.\" \" I consider an American,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" would have admired those high places chiefly from the bottom. I consider it would have been more smart.\" \" But, little Father,\" said Froken Emilie, \" was it not worse when he wanted to catch a salmon for Provst Simonsen, at the time his eldest daughter was married ? \" \" It was then foolhardy,\" said the Amtmand ; \" but then he was led away by the sport he so much likes. There is a defile near here where the water rushes through rocks in a narrow channel, thus causing a broken fall of water. The salmon ascend it with difficulty, but when they have succeeded they always rest for a while in the smooth water immediately above the fall. Mr. Stirling, fishing from a boat, had risen a salmon to a fly, but the salmon refused to take it. He then spun a minnow, in dangerous proximity to the rapid, and hooked the salmon, which tried to rush down the rapid, and this drew the boat into danger. If the boat had gone down the rapid it would have been dashed to pieces, and the two men rowing the boat and Mr. Stirling would have been drowned. He took his pipe slowly out of his pocket, filled and lit it as coolly as if in his easy-chair at his"], [33, "21 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. quarters. The men's hearts had failed them, but his coolness reassured them, and, by desperate efforts, they got the boat in safety. If Mr. Stirling had stood up in the boat, or interfered, it would have precipitated the crisis. The salmon was gaffed from the bank of the river, and the men were breathless with their exertions and fear. But Mr. Stirling simply said, ' My pipe is in the boat ; fetch it, Jacob.' ' Why,' said Jacob, ' we were thanking God that our lives were spared, and the first thing you think of is your pipe.' ' Quite right,' said Mr. Stirling ; ' but that is no reason why you should not fetch my pipe. I am putting on another minnow to try in the same place ; there is sure to be another there.' And so he did, and caught another salmon, undergoing about the same experiences as before.\" \" I consider that man not such a fool,\" said Tyssen, \"and that's a fact.\" \" I think,\" said the Amtmand, \" we will call and see him to-morrow. He fishes at night, sleeps in the day, about four o'clock has dinner, and is overhauling his tackle. He will, without doubt, not only give you leave to fish, but show you how to catch a salmon.\" \" Right,\" said Harild Tyssen ; \" and thank you very much.\""], [34, "22 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

When the Amtmand and his family were assembled in the room where coffee was served in the morning, Harild Tyssen came in looking fresh and well after a sound night's rest. The Amtmand was reading some papers, his wife was knitting, and one of bis daughters was attending to the coffee and serving it. The impression of the whole scene was that of comfort and home. \" I think, Herr Amtmand,\" said Harild Tyssen, \"that we concluded last night to visit the Englishman at Vange.\" \" We did,\" replied the Amtmand ; \" it is a four hours'"], [35, "23 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. drive in a Kariol, and I have ordered two to be ready after breakfast.\" \" But,\" said Tyssen, \" the Englishman told me that it would occupy a day to clear his baggage through the Customs' in Bergen. He has, he says, provisions on which the duty has to be assessed, and that the Custom house officers will take nearly a day to do it.\" \" Very possible,\" said the Amtmand. \" Yes, but that would be yesterday,\" said Tyssen, \" and to-day the Englishman will not have arrived at his station.\" \" He will get there by the time we shall,\" said the Amtmand, \" but we had better let him settle down for a day or two. He will also have ascertained by that time if the salmon are in the river. They may not have left the Fjord yet.\" \" Can we not make an excursion to Haugstad S\u00e6ter, little Father ? \" said Fraken Emilie ; \" the Amerikaner would like to see the snow on the Fjelds before it has disappeared.\" \" What is a S\u00e6ter ? \" asked Harild Tyssen. \"It is a summer dairy-farm,\" replied the Amtmand ; \"there is a hut situated on the grazing lands in the Fjelds, in which the people live and make cheese and butter. It will take you six hours to walk up, but you can return in four. You will see the Fjelds with the snow fast disappearing, and will have fine views of the"], [36, "24 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. higher Fjelds. A baggage-horse can be sent up with lunch, and by the time you arrive at the S\u00e6ter you will have acquired an appetite. The only thing you can obtain at the S\u00e6ter for which you would care is the milk ; but that is excellent.\" \" Thank you, Herr Amtmand,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" I should like such an excursion beyond everything. Is it too hard work for ladies to go so far? \" \" By no means,\" said Emilie ; \" I and my sisters will go, and our friend, Agathe Simonsen, who is engaged to be married to Kapellan Hansen, will also probably go. What do you say, little Father ? \" \" Order it as you will,\" said the Amtmand, \" only enjoy yourselves.\" \" Are there any bears in the district? \" asked Tyssen. \" The people at the S\u00e6ter will tell you if a bear has been heard of within many miles round,\" replied the Amtmand. \" A bear is occasionally heard of at this time of the year ; but it generally turns out to be a J\u00e6rv, that is, a wolverine. The whortleberry and other berries on the Fjeld are not yet ripe, and the bear would interfere now with the cattle on the Fjelds. After the berries are ripe he is not so troublesome, but this depends on his hunger and opportunity. If you do hear of a bear, I will sift the information you obtain, and, if worth while, can procure you experienced guides, without whose assistance it would be useless to go.\""], [37, "25 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Thank you, Herr Amtmand,\" said Tyssen ; \" my father would like a bear-skin from Norway.\" \"No doubt,\" said the Amtmand, \"but there is little chance of a bear in this district ; the Fjelds are difficult over which to follow a bear, but still the pursuit may interest you.\" The baggage-horse was despatched to the S\u00e6ter. Fraken Emilie Nordal had organized the expedition, and had taken care that there should be no lack of provisions. She and Harild Tyssen marched in front ; her sisters, Sophie and Olava, next ; and last came Kapellan Hansen and Fraken Agathe Simonsen. \"Now,\" said Fraken Emilie, before they started, \" Sophie and Olava, you must not look back at Kapellan Hansen and Agathe ; they are engaged people, who generally behave ridiculously, and do not like being watched.\" \" We will watch you narrowly instead,\" said Olava ; \" you have taken the Amerikaner all to yourself ; your designs are already obvious.\" \" The Amerikaner is quite safe with me,\" said Fraken Emilie, \" whilst he might be the subject of practical jokes with you.\" \" Thanks for the care shown,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" but I confess I like ladies' practical jokes. A lady is always too kind to hurt.\" \" We can walk two abreast now we are in the valley,\""], [38, "26 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. said Fraken Emilie, \" but soon we shall have to march in Indian file.\" \" Are there not superstitions attached to the S\u00e6ters ? \" asked Harild Tyssen. \" There are superstitions connected with every object in nature, in Norway,\" replied Fraken Emilie, \" that is to say, of the Fjords, Fjelds, rivers, and the like ; but you may have superstitions even in New York.\" \" Yes, we have ; but I consider,\" said Tyssen, \" that they are more in connection with dollars than anything else.\" \" We have here what we call Folketro, or the super stitions of the people,\" said Fraken Emilie. \" My father says that the lonely life the people have led for centuries in the S\u00e6ters is the cause of much of it, their minds being influenced by the striking natural changes that occur on the Fjelds.\" \"I have heard of the tradition of the Huldr,\" said Tyssen ; \" a sort of gnome.\" \" I scarcely know what a gnome is,\" said Fraken Emilie ; \" but the description of the Huldr in our tra ditions is clear and distinct. The Huldr of our Folketro is pictured as a tall fair woman, dressed in a yellow bodice and blue skirt, with her yellow hair loose over her shoulders. That happens when she acts the part of a siren to attract mortals. She is then seen sitting on a rock, sewing or knitting.\""], [39, "27 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" But there must be some tradition of the origin of the Huldr?\" said Tyssen. \" The belief is,\" replied Fraken Emilie, \" that some of the fallen angels, who had not sinned so grievously as the others, are allowed to inhabit the air, the earth, the sea, and under the earth ; and it is believed that the Huldr, the Underjordiske (underground people), and the Trolds, are these angels.\" \"You fascinate like the Huldr herself,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" when you tell me so much that interests; but can you mention a case of a mortal being attracted by her ? \" \" There are many stories of such,\" replied Fraken Emilie. \" There was once a woodcutter who, with two other men, built themselves a hut to sleep in near their work in the woods. One day he had cut down a heavier tree than usual, and rested awhile. Suddenly he was aware of a ball of thread at his feet, and, looking up, saw a woman sitting on a high rock sewing. She was so very beautiful that he could not turn away his eyes from her. ' Bring up my sewing thread,' she exclaimed. He did so, and stood looking at her a long time. At last he recommenced his work, and, looking up again, saw that she was gone. In the night the Huldr came and took him from between his comrades, where he had been sleeping in the hut ; and he was absent three days. A long time after, whilst he was splitting logs for a fence and had"], [40, "28 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. driven a wedge into a crack, his wife appeared with his dinner, bringing a can as bright as silver. She sat down on the log, and he saw that she had a cow's tail, which she was carefully hiding in the crack near the wedge. As may be supposed, he lost all appetite for his dinner ; but he sat down by his wife, and with his finger wrote the name of Jesus on the can, and pulled the wedge out of the log, so that it held the cow's tail fast. Instead of his wife, it was the Huldr. She sprang up and left the cow's tail in the log ; and the can, that had looked like silver, was nothing more than a piece of bark with some rotten moss in it. You will be more interested to hear these stories from the people at the S\u00e6ter than from me ; the difficulty is, they are so shy of speaking of such things.\" \" Nothing can be better than your relation of the story,\" said Harild Tyssen, lifting his hat. \" That may be ; but there is this difference,\" said Fraken Emilie, \" and that is, I do not believe in the existence of the Huldr, but the people do ; and a tradition heard from them has then an earnestness that only faith gives ; and, furthermore, there is the quaintness of the recital.\" \" Well put,\" said Tyssen. \"But what is the matter with your sisters ? They are very merry.\" \" Ha, ha, ha ! cold missionary ! \" said Fraken Olava. \" Hee, hee, hee ! \" laughed Fraken Sophie ; \" cold mis sionary ! \" \" What is it, Sophie ? \" asked her sister."], [41, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 29 \" It is Kapellan Hansen that is so funny. He has been telling Agathe Simonsen that he thinks of going out to the South Sea Islands as a missionary, where, instead of cold beef, the natives offer their friends cold missionary, after roasting one in an oven. He has, he says, read about it in an English paper, so it must be true ; and Agathe is so distressed that we are trying to laugh it away. You know Erik Begh's verse, Mr. Tyssen ? Min Mening er at salig Lund Har Ret til Punkt og Prikke Kan vi ej le, vort Galskab ud Bort gr\u00e6der vi denikke. That is, that the deceased Mr. Lund's opinion was accurate when he stated that if we could not laugh away foolishness we could not get rid of it by crying.\" \" I know he only does it to tease me,\" said Fraken Agathe, \" but it makes me feel so horrid. Ugh ! \" \" Now, little Agathe,\" said the Kapellan, \"I am not going out as a missionary. You know I am seeking a call.\" \" But if you cannot get a call,\" urged his betrothed, \" there is no knowing what horrid thing you may do.\" \" Well,\" said the Kapellan, \"I promise you they shall not bake me in an oven if I can help it, and if they do I will disagree with them.\" Fraken Agathe was visibly comforted, and they pro-"], [42, "30 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. ceeded on their way to the S\u00e6ter. The path through the valley was easy to ascend, but gradually it led by per- pendicular walls of rock, or on the edges of steep ravines, and the American felt the unusual exertion. His Norse friends went on easily in Indian file, talking and laugh- ing, as fresh and cool as possible, while Harild Tyssen was breathless and perspiring from every pore. When about 2,500 feet above sea-level had been reached, a plateau appeared, covered to a great extent with snow, then fast and daily disappearing. The smoke from the S\u00e6ter-hut, and the baggage-horse tethered near, was a sign of life and habitation. A tub of brightly-scoured wood, filled with milk, was offered by Berthe Haug stad, the occupant of the S\u00e6ter, and was particularly grateful to Harild Tyssen, whose thirst had become intense. The S\u00e6ter was a hut with two compartments : the first was about 16 feet by 20 feet. On the right there was a rough bar, and on the left a hearth-fire, with a large iron pot over it, for cheese-making; there was also a bench, a small table, two stools, and a few simple cups. The whole place was untidy, from the fact that so much work was done there. The second room was of the same area. Around were shelves, on which were placed tubs, all bright and clean, of different sizes, containing milk, cream, butter, and cheese, and, from its neatness and order, strongly contrasted with the untidiness of the outer"], [43, "31 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. room. The good or bad management of the milk pro ducts were shown at once by the inspection of this room, and the sustenance of many a Norse family is dependent materially thereon. However idyllic S\u00e6ter life may be, there is actually much hard work. Young women have early to acquire the practical knowledge of managing the cows, the sheep, the goats, and the dairy, and not only the dairy, but the cheese-making consequent thereon, in all its variety of sort and quality. The result of this life is, that a young woman acquires the practical knowledge necessary in a high degree, and develops under it ; but, of all other things, she exhibits a simplicity that sur prises and interests, yet never shocks. Their honest Norse natures are too clear and bright to suggest other than what is apparent. Berthe Jacobsdatter Haugstad, that is, Berthe the daughter of Jacob of Haugstad, was about twenty-two, and her appearance showed but little signs of the hard work which had become to her a habit ; her hair was plaited in two plaits, tied at the ends with red worsted. She was dressed in the usual blue wadmel dress, and wore what are called field-shoes, which were made of leather, like the foot of a mocassin. Berthe welcomed the Frekener Nordal and Simonsen, and the Herr Kapellan, to the S\u00e6ter; and to Harild Tyssen, who was the son of a man of her own class, she said :"], [44, "32 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"Welcome to Norway, Harild Tyssen.\" This pleased the American. It was a free nature speaking to a citizen of the United States. The lunch sent up by the Amtmand's foresight was simple, but sufficient. The spirits of all rose, and the Kapellan, getting on his legs and striking a cup with the back of a knife, to attract attention, said : \" I have risen to propose a Skaal (a health), to be drunk in our cracked mugs, filled to the brim with S\u00e6ter milk, to the Amerikaner, Herr Harild Tyssen, and to bid him a welcome to Norway and her S\u00e6ters. We have seen him suffering from heat as a consequence of unusual exertion, ascend the Fjelds, his manly breast inspired with their pure air and the free Constitution of the United States. He has looked into the deep blue of Berthe Haugstad's eyes, and seen a profundity of natural free dom that surpasses the laws an American Congress can suggest, or the mind of man contemplate. A Skaal for Herr Harild Tyssen ! \" The toast was drunk with much merriment. Harild rose, and said : \" Thank you a thousand times. Such a welcome is indeed pleasant. But I will say no more, as I long to hear more of the Huldrefolk. May I ask if either of the Frekener present will relate a story of the Huldrefolk, so that we may hope subsequently to hear another from Berthe Haugstad ? \""], [45, "33 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. With the kindly instinct of a Norse girl, Olava Tyssen at once realised the position, and began : \" There was once an old couple, well-to-do, in a farm in the valley, with a good S\u00e6ter in the Fjelds. They often went to the S\u00e6ter themselves, and had it furnished better than usual. They heard, however, that as soon as they left the S\u00e6ter the Huldrefolk occupied it, and that they had with them a young Huldr, who was very beautiful. The old couple had a son, who was in the cavalry, and he heard the story of the beautiful Huldr. So one day he put on his uniform, placed his pistols in their holsters, and rode up to the S\u00e6ter. When he arrived, he saw the S\u00e6ter was occupied by the Huldrefolk. He tethered his horse, took a pistol from its holster, and went softly to the window of the S\u00e6ter-hut and looked in. He saw a man and woman so unusually ugly, and so unaccountably old, that he thought he had never before seen such hideous objects. But there was a girl there, so extraordinary in her beauty, that he felt that life without her was not to be borne. All three had cow-tails. He could see they had only just arrived, as they had not had time to get their things in order. The girl was occupied in washing the room. The old woman was lighting the fire under the big kettle. The cavalry soldier stepped into the doorway, and fired his pistol over the girl's head. She fell down, and became at once as ugly as she had before been beautiful. Her nose grew to a foot's length. ' Now 3"], [46, "34 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. she is yours, cavalry soldier,' said the old man ; ' you can take her ; but I will wash her first.' As he washed her she grew less ugly, and her nose grew less, and her cow- tail was tied up ; but, notwithstanding this, she was ugly, and remained ugly. ' Now take her, my fine cavalry soldier,' said Hudr Huldremand ; ' put her up on your saddle, and ride home with her, and marry her ; when you celebrate your wedding, prepare the little room by the side of the large one in your father's house, for we will come, with our relations, to the wedding ; and when you have drunk the bride's health come to us imme- diately.' The cavalry soldier did as he was told. When they went to church to be married the bride asked one of the bridesmaids to stand behind her, so that no one might see when her cow-tail fell off, as this would happen on the priest putting his hand on her head. As ter the bride's health had been drunk, the cavalry soldier visited the little room, but could see no one in it, but there was such a quantity of gold and silver things left by the old Huldrefolk that he at once became a rich man. All went well for a long time, and every time a Gilde (festivity) was held the little room was prepared for the old Huldre- folk, who always left so much gold and silver that they did not know what to do with it. The Huldr, however, remained ugly, and the soldier grew tired of her, and often beat her. One day he wanted to shoe his horse, but, although he was a tolerable smith, he could not that"], [47, "35 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. day fit the shoes to the horse's hoofs. ' It is best I do it,' said his wife ; and she forthwith pinched the cold iron with her fingers, so that the shoes fitted exactly. ' You are strong with your fingers,' said the soldier. ' Yes,' said his wife, ' if I had used my strength against you when you beat me it would have been awkward for you.' The soldier never after beat his wife.\" \" Thank you, Fraken OlaVa,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" a well-told story. Do you know any, Berthe ? \" Berthe, who had become interested in her visitors, had thrown aside her shyness, and said : \" Yes, many. A long time ago, in the summer, when the cattle were being taken to the S\u00e6ter, they became so difficult to manage all at once that the S\u00e6ter people could not collect them. There was, however, a S\u00e6ter girl who had lately been betrothed, and she collected and con trolled the cattle in a way no one could understand. She lived in the S\u00e6ter by herself, with only a dog. One day the man to whom she was betrothed came to the S\u00e6ter and talked with her the whole day, and other people came that she seemed to know, bearing in silver dishes, and preparing for a wedding. A bride's crown was set upon her head, but the dog was restless, and ran away to where her betrothed lived, and howled and barked. At last the girl's betrothed took his rifle and went to the S\u00e6ter. As he approached he saw it surrounded with tethered horses. He looked in at the window, and be- 3 *"], [48, "36 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. hold ! all the place was full of Huldrefolk. He fired his rifle over their heads, and at once the door flew open, and balls of thread, small and large, came tumbling out. When he went into the S\u00e6ter, there sat his betrothed as bride, only wanting a ring on her finger to be ready to be married. The silver dishes were pieces of birch-bark, and were full of rotten moss, frog's spawn, and tadpoles. To prevent any further interference with his betrothed, the man married her the same day, and the gilt crown and bridal ornaments that she had on her are still pre served in the family.\" \" A picturesque tradition,\" said the Kapellan ; \" but can you tell us something of your own experience, Berthe ? \" \" Yes,\" replied Berthe, \" but it is not much. A cow had been killed by a bear, and the others were frightened, and gave much trouble and little milk. One day we lost one of the cows, and could not find her. So I went with the boy who was with me at the S\u00e6ter, and at last dis covered her in an old reindeer-trap. The difficulty and labour of getting the cow to the S\u00e6ter was so great that when near the S\u00e6ter I fell down, I was so tired. At last I got up, and went into the S\u00e6ter-hut. The fire was alight, and the cheese-kettle warming, and that, although I had been absent twenty-four hours. A Huldr sat by the fire, and said, ' Berthe, I have kept all in full drift since you have been away,' and she had. I was so tired that"], [49, "37 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. I fell on the bed, and when I awoke the Huldr was gone.\" \" It was clear her strength was overspent,\" said the Kapellan, \" and imagination did the rest.\" \"Are there any bears about here now ? \" asked Harild Tyssen. \" No,\" replied Berthe ; \" if there were, I should know it ; the cattle would be restless. There have been none here for the last two years.\" \" I think it is time,\" said Fraken Emilie, \" for us to thank Berthe, and return to Nordal.\" \" Thank you, Berthe,\" said Harild Tyssen, giving her a twenty Kroner piece. \" I have to account for the milk,\" said Berthe, \" and that is little more than a Krone, and I have no money at all to give change.\" \" Pay for the milk, Mr. Tyssen, as she says,\" said the Kapellan ; \" it will annoy her to receive more.\" When they returned to Nordal the Amtmand, who had seen them coming, had some freshly-made tea ready ; but Harild Tyssen was so fatigued that he went to his room, after asking permission to do so, and fell asleep at once."], [50, "38 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

Welhaven. \"And how is it, Herr Tyssen,\" asked the Amtmand the next morning, as Harild Tyssen appeared, feeling stiff from the climb up the S\u00e6ter the day before. \"I consider I was fatigued last night,\" replied Tyssen, in his American manner, \" and I am considerably stiff now, but I feel wonderfully well, and believe in the power of mountain air.\" \" Were you interested in what you saw and heard ? \" asked the Amtmand."], [51, "39 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Yes, considerably,\" replied Tyssen. \" I have been interested to find that yours is an older world here. The superstition about the Huldrefolk must have taken centuries to mature.\" \" It is difficult even to guess at the time of its origin,\" said the Amtmand. \" There are few superstitions with such picturesque imagery as that of the Huldrefolk. The tradition presents a life-like scene to the mind, and the colouring is vividly distinct.\" \" I think so, too,\" said Tyssen. \" Did you get Berthe Haugstad to sing the Huldrefolk's cattle-call? \" said the Amtmand, addressing his daughter Emilie. \" No, little Father,\" replied his daughter. \" Berthe occupied Herr Tyssen with such a long description of the methods of making different sorts of cheese, the manage ment of the cattle, and the stories of the Huldrefolk, that I forgot it.\" \" The cattle-call, which the Huldrefolk are said to use, and which many people have told me they have often heard,\" said the Amtmand, \" is called the Huldre Lok. The air is well known, and the names of the cows in the cattle-call are the same as the Bender use ; but little Olava can sing it.\" The Amtmand's daughter Olava at once went to the piano and sang the Huldre Lok. The air is as follows."], [52, "40 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

Emilie laughs ho, ho, ho ! and Sophie, hee, hee, hee!\" \" I observed that yesterday,\" said Tyssen ; \" but it is natural to each, and suits them.\""], [53, "41 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"The Huldre Lok, with its high notes,\" said the Amtmand, \" can be heard a long distance ; and this is the solution of its being attributed to the Huldrefolk; every S\u00e6ter girl knows it and sings it.\" \"But what are the plans for to-day?\" asked the Amtmandinde. \" There is a Fos half a Norse mile from here. Is Herr Tyssen too tired to walk there to-day ? \" \" Your Fraken daughters would be, Fru Nordal,\" replied Tyssen, \" and I do not care to go alone.\" \" Two of my daughters can accompany you, Herr Tyssen,\" said Fru Nordal ; \" it is Olava's week to manage the housekeeping.\" \" And as Herr Tyssen,\" added the Amtmand, \" had no dinner yesterday, he must have a good dinner to-day ; it does not suit an American to miss a square meal. The distance to the Fos is not quite four English miles, and the road is easy ; a Stolkj\u00e6rre (a cart with a seat in it) can get close up to the Fos.\" \" We are not in the least tired, Herr Tyssen,\" said Fraken Emilie, \" and should enjoy it very much.\" \" I will send a man with some lunch up to the Fos,\" said the Amtmand, \" and you can return by five o'clock, when we will have dinner.\" \" I think,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" that before I visit the Englishman to whom you promised me an introduc tion, I had better get into condition for active exercise. Life at New York, and the voyage over, do not fit a man"], [54, "42 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. for the Fjelds. The excursion Fru Nordal has so kindly suggested is the very thing.\" \" You are quite right, Herr Tyssen,\" said the Amt mand. \" The Englishman is as strong as a bull, and as active as a squirrel ; you want to be able to walk well before you can enjoy the sport he will doubtless have pleasure in showing you.\" The way to the Fos, or waterfall, afforded the same scenery of rough boulders, and birch and fir spreading up the sides of the Fjeld, the top of which was partly covered with snow. Emilie and Sophie Nordal chatted pleasantly with Harild Tyssen, giving him the local news, and a description of the people they were generally in contact with. They had begun to like the American's straightforward manner, even though it might be a little blunt. The perfect truthfulness of every word and act induced them to speak frankly to him ; and a friendship soon grew which time strengthened. At a considerable distance from the Fos its droning sound could be heard, growing louder as they approached. \" My father told me,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" our name of Tyssen is derived from the dashing sound of a water fall.\" (The word in Norse is pronounced as if written in English Tussen.) \" Yes, it is so,\" said Freken Emilie. \" There are many places called Tysse and Tyssen in Norway.\" As the Fos came in view with its thundering sound of"], [55, "43 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. many waters, Tyssen uttered an exclamation of surprise. The beauty of the waterfall struck him. Several feet of water fell over the edge of a precipice, which was escarped by the flow of the river. The water was as clear as crystal, and fell with a steady unbroken fall of about one hundred feet until near the bed of the river, when it fell on masses of sharp rocks, sending up clouds of diamond like spray into the sunlight. The waterfall was sur rounded by foliage, pine, birch, and fir, and a luxuriant growth of ferns filled every available ledge and crevice of the rocks. \" It is Nature not only in her strength, but also in her beauty,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" I have seen Niagara, and its vastness impresses, but this waterfall enchants and charms.\" \" We have heard many speak in the same strong praise of the Fos,\" said Fraken Sophie. \" Our larger waterfalls are the Vering Fos, which is said to be 900 feet, but is less. The Skj\u00e6ggedals Fos is about the same height ; but the Ejukan Fos is lower. These waterfalls are larger ; but this Fos, which we call the Rugen Fos, is the most beautiful.\" \" Our father says,\" added Freken Emilie, \" that the Bugen Fos is set in the middle of a pretty picture.\" \" No description can be more apt,\" said Tyssen. \" The Englishman, Herr Stirling,\" said Freken Sophie, \" has often sketched the Fos in water-colours, and you"], [56, "44 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. may have observed one of these sketches in my father's room at Nordal.\" \" I have read that the word Fos is in Scotland supposed to mean ' force,' \" said Tyssen, \" that is, natural force, and that these waterfalls are called Fors ; but my father told me that Fos, or Voss, meant ' water,' and that the Voss district in Norway is so called because its area contains so much water in lakes and rivers.\" \" It is what we think, also,\" said Freken Emilie ; \" my father has told us the same.\" \"Are there any salmon here? \" asked Tyssen. \" Yes, but not many,\" replied Freken Emilie. \"They cannot, of course, get up the Fos ; and below the Fos, to the sea, the river, for part of its course, dashes over masses of rock, or runs over shallow pebble-beds that are often dry. There are no deep pools to contain the salmon in the river. They swim up to the Fos when the water is high aud fall back to the Fjord when it is low. A few fish are left in the bed of the river, but these the Bonder leister, although attempts have been made to stop the practice.\" \" But could they not make a fish-pass by the Fos ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Several schemes have been suggested to my father,\" replied Fraken Emilie, \" but he has approved of none of them. There is the difficulty of blasting the masses of rock on each side of the Fos, and if the rock over which the"], [57, "45 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. water flows were blown up it would affect the water rights of the people above the Fos.\" \" You talk of these subjects like your father,\" remarked Tyssen. \" I may appear to do so,\" replied Freken Emilie. \" I am to a great extent his secretary, and open his letters in his absence and answer them ; and when he returns he directs me to reply as he judges best. I thus acquire a knowledge of what business is done in his Amt.\" \" What are the chief duties of an Amtmand ? \" in quired Tyssen. \" They are more ministerial than executive,\" replied Freken Emilie ; \" that is how my father expresses it. He is, in fact, a minister of the king, appointed in a district, acting as an Indenrigs \u2014 Minister or Home Secretary.\" \" What a wonderful likeness there is between you three sisters,\" said Harild Tyssen, after a pause. \" You are strikingly like each other in appearance, your manners are the same, and your thoughts are all in harmony with one another. If it were not that your voices differed there would be no difference.\" \" My father says this often occurs in Norse families,\" said Freken Sophie. \" His idea is that the long winters, when we are so much together, tend to such a result.\" \" Possibly,\" said Tyssen. \" There are the same influ ences at work casting you all in the same mould. I can but admire the subjects of such influence.\""], [58, "46 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"Now, Herr Tyssen, you are beginning to flatter,\" said Freken Emilie ; \" we know all men do, but we do not like it.\" \" No, we do not,\" said her sister, in a more decided tone. As they were returning to Nordal, Freken Olava came to meet them. \" My father desired me to tell you, Herr Tyssen,\" she said, \" that he expects Provst Simonsen, his daughter, and Kapellan Hansen to dinner.\" \" Thank you, Fraken Olava,\" said Tyssen. \" What sort of a man is the Provst ? \" \"He is generally liked,\" said Freken Emilie. \"The Bender esteem the way he speaks at marriages and the like. He uses the fewest and simplest words, straight to the point. His manner is kind, and it has a great effect on young people, consequently he is popular with the older.\" \" But he is chiefly respected,\" added Freken Sophie, \" for the care and trouble he takes with candidates for confirmation. We think much of the rite of confirmation in Norway.\" \" And so it should be in every country,\" said Tyssen. The dinner at the Amtmand's was well arranged and well managed. There was no strain or effort, but the Amtmand and his family by their naturally kind manners created content and pleasure. The Provst asked many questions about the churches"], [59, "47 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. in New York, the state of religious feeling there, and was interested in Harild Tyssen's answers. The Kapellan asked about the Scandinavians in America, and whether there was likely to be any opening in the Lutheran communities for a Norwegian priest. \" I can procure that information easily,\" said Tyssen, \u25a0\" by writing to my father ; and if you wish to take such a position his influence is so great with the Scandinavians in America that it is possible that he will be able to arrange it for you.\" \" Oh, goodness ! \" exclaimed Fraken Agathe Simonsen, \"' don't think of it, Karl.\" \" I prefer it to going out as a missionary and being roasted and then eaten cold,\" said the Kapellan. \" I think, Karl Hansen,\" said the Provst, \"that you can find work to do in your own country.\" \" And I am sure,\" added his daughter, \" that he only says those things to tease me.\" \" Of course he does, Agathe,\" said the Amtmand. \"Your republican institutions in America,\" said the Provst, addressing Harild Tyssen, \" appear to me to convey the idea of liberty without a greater reality than with us.\" \" You were born in chains,\" said Tyssen, \" and do not feel them. Every man is free in America. You are the subjects of one man, a monarch ; and every man born under a monarchy is more or less a slave.\""], [60, "48 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Wait a bit,\" said the Amtmand. \" Let us consider ; we are governed and taxed by ourselves, through our representatives, whom we choose ourselves by a low fran chise. Where is the difference between us and America, Herr Tyssen ? \" \" Your ministers of state are appointed by the King,\" replied Tyssen. \" Who does as Congress does : selects the men who are supported by the votes and opinion of the people,\" said the Amtmand. \" The King can, however, veto any measure tbe Stor thing passes,\" urged Tyssen ; \" and he has done so.\" \" Very rarely,\" added the Amtmand ; \" but at a third Parliament, the measure the King has vetoed is passed, if it be the will of the country that it should.\" \" You cannot say that you have parliamentary rule,\" said Tyssen, \" when the ministers of the King do not sit in the Storthing. No q uestion can be put to them by the representatives of the people. No act that they do can be challenged.\" \" The original idea was, in 1814,\" said the Amtmand, \" that the ministers of the King might influence the people's representatives if they sat with them ; but this question has not only been raised but fought out, and they will now sit in the Storthing. The measure was vetoed by the King ; but the Storthing impeached his ministers, tried, and fined them ; and the King had to fall in with"], [61, "49 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. what was inevitable. The last majority for the measure was 31 in 114 representatives. We are thus virtually a republic and enjoy [as much freedom as in the United States.\" \" The King might create a nobility,\" urged Tys- sen. \" That was disposed of in 1821,\" replied the Amt mand ; \" hereditary nobility was then abolished, and that in opposition to the royal veto.\" \" But your elections differ from ours ; they are influ enced by men in power,\" said Tyssen. \" Not in the least,\" replied the Amtmand. \" There is too strong a feeling of independence. The representatives are chiefly of the Bender or land-owning class, and they are selected, as a rule, solely from their being likely to be the most useful men in the country's interests. Party politics exist ; but a Norwegian is a Norwegian first and a politician after.\" \" You will find it difficult,\" said the Provst, \" to make out that a Norwegian is not as free as a citizen of your great Republic.\" \"It is a fact that I cannot,\" confessed Tyssen; \"I frankly admit I have learnt a lesson.\" \" Our political discussions, however,\" said the Provst, \u25a0\" do not interest the ladies, Herr Amtmand. Shall we rise and go into the other room ? \" The Provst rose from the dining-table, and with cere- 4"], [62, "50 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. monial politeness shook hands with Fru Nordal, saying, \" Tak for Mad,\" in the old Norwegian manner. His daughter Agathe brought him his pipe, and he sat down on the sofa in the sitting-room the Amtmand and his family usually occupied. Freken Olava handed a cigar box to Harild Tyssen that he might take a cigar, and afterwards to her father, and then served coffee. \" Sing, little Olava,\" said her father. She went to the piano and sang an old Norse song with tact and taste, her handsome face and youthful freshness making a charming picture. \" The broad and deep chests you three sisters possess,\" said the Provst, \" is what gives such a compass to your singing. I recollect Fru Nordal's voice at her daughter's age, and, although mellowed by time, it is still sweet and clear.\" \" Yes, we grow older,\" said the Amtmandinde, \" but our children make us young again.\" \" That 's what I like to hear,\" said the Provst. \" No one but a mother with the kindest instincts could say that and mean it. It indicates happiness and home.\" The Provst's words lingered in Harild Tyssen's ears."], [63, "51 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. CHAPTER V.

If I had written you at once I do not know that I should have written you any differently. The open kindliness of the Amtmand and his family was at once apparent. Everything about them is simple and true, and I like them more than any people I ever met before. The consideration they have for me, and the tact with which they show that consideration, charms. 4 *"], [64, "52 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. They appear to be constantly thinking of what will inte rest me as their guest. We have been to a S\u00e6ter, and every day we have visited some fresh place, and at dinner there has always been one or two persons invited to meet me whom I had not met before, and I have found that these persons were selected because they would not only interest but instruct. If the Amtmand is occupied, his daughter Emilie assists him ; then Fru Nordal and her other two daughters take charge of me, and I have indeed a good time. The Amtmand has written to an English man, called Stirling, to ask him to give me some fishing in the river he rents, aud he has replied that he will be glad to do so at any time.\" Harild Tyssen closed his letter with messages of strong affection to his mother and repeated thanks to his father for his invariable kindness. \" Well, Herr Tyssen,\" said the Amtmand one day, after Harild Tyssen had been staying there some time, \" the Englishman will be glad to see you, and I can accompany you to his station, and when you are tired of it you can return here. What do you say ? \" \"That I should be glad to go,\" replied Tyssen, promptly. \" I feel now capable of any active occupation, after the long walks and climbing in the Fjelds that your kindness has given me the opportunity of experiencing.\" \" We shall be four hours driving by Kariol to Vange,\" said the Amtmand. \" I shall stay the night at the Land-"], [65, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 53 handler's, and you can do so also if you do not wish to remain with the Englishman at his quarters.\" John Stirling, the Englishman in question, had been in Norway many years. He had built a house, that con tained a sitting-room and two bed-rooms, with a verandah in front, so contrived that his fishing-rods might be placed under shelter without being taken to pieces. He had also built a little hut about thirty yards distant from his log house, in which the simple cooking that suited his taste was done. A little mountain-stream, flowing down from the Fjeld over a precipice, enabled him to dam up its Fos pool about five feet deep with the freshest and brightest water. This was his washing-basin. \" Glad to see you and your friend ! \" shouted a cheery English voice, as the Amtmand halted his Kariol in the post-road about fifty yards from Stirling's log house. The Englishman came out of the half door at the end of the verandah. He was square-built, with a firm tread, and every motion indicated a life passed in active exer cise. His face was intellectual, and not much unlike the Amtmand's in its frank expression. \" Come in ; dinner is ready for you,\" he said. \"The Skydskarl can take your two Kariols to the station.\" The Amtmand introduced Harild Tyssen, whose hand winced under Stirling's grip, he himself being uncon scious of having done more than given the American's hand a friendly shake."], [66, "54 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Stirling's room was filled witb rods, gun-cases, and fishing-tackle, but all in order and ready for instant service. A table four feet square was laid for dinner. Everything was simple and plain, but best in quality. The Amtmand was loud in his praise of the salmon-cutlet fried in salad oil. \" It is a cut from a fish I got this morning,\" explained Stirling. \" It is one of the old fat schoolmasters that come up the river first. I caught him at three this morning. \" At three this morning ! \" exclaimed Tyssen, \" Yes,\" said Stirling. \" The river fishes best at night and early morning. I sleep generally from ten to four in the day, and this enables me to fish all night, subject, of course, to the weather. In wet weather the salmon will rise as well, if not better, in the day as at night. The fact is, the humour of the river changes. Often, with plenty of fish in it, they are hard to move ; the river gets sulky, and then it is best left alone ; and the longer the sulky fit lasts, the better the sport that follows.\" \" You interest me already in the sport,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" Possibly,\" added Stirling. \" Salmon-fishing has much to attract when understood ; and a man with your quick American instinct requires only a suggestion where others cannot learn a lesson.\" \" Good,\" said the Amtmand. \" You are a keen"], [67, "55 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. observer, Herr Stirling, and have judged Herr Tyssen correctly.\" \" I like a man with quick intelbgence,\" said John Stirling, in his frank, open manner; \"and I shall be glad to be of service in showing your friend any sport. It will be a pleasure to do so, but a greater pleasure to show that I am grateful to you, Herr Amtmand, for many a kindness.\" \"A thousand thanks,\" said the Amtmand. \"When did you get here ? \" \" A week since,\" replied Stirling. \" I was detained by the Customs at Bergen, and missed the Fjord steamer. When you next go to Bergen, Herr Amtmand, and see any of the Custom-house people, ask them how the Englishman's wine tasted, and they will not give a favourable reply.\" \" What is the story about it ? \" asked the Amt mand. \"When I arrived at Bergen,\" explained Stirling, \"I had with me a wine-cask, such as is used in some wine districts to carry wine on mules where carts cannot travel. The cask appeared full, and to assess the duty they said it was necessary to taste the wine in it. Three glasses were produced, also a gimlet and spigot, and the hard oak wood of the cask at length bored through ; but no wine followed. The gimlet was pushed in to its full length and turned sharply round, when lo ! there was a"], [68, "56 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. bit of the green of a cucumber's skin at the end of the gimlet. ' God preserve us ! ' they said ; ' what wine ! ' I then explained that the cask was full of vegetables. The disappointment in the honest faces of the Custom-house officials was great ; but they bore it like men, as a large stone jar remained, in which there was, without doubt, something good. They shook it and listened, and the gurgling sound told them that it was full of something. The cork was extracted, and the dark sherry-coloured liquid was tasted by the three officials present, each man emptying his glass at a pull. It was vinegar ; but neither man would undeceive his neighbour. They were accus tomed to white vinegar, and it never occurred to them that it was wine vinegar. ' Why did you not tell us what was in those things ? ' demanded the oldest official. ' Because you did not ask me,' I replied ; ' and I thought the way you proceeded was not quite in order, and that I had better not interfere when an irregularity was occurring.' \" \" Very amusing,\" said the Amtmand ; \" but, of course, the story spread ? \" \"Yes,\" replied Stirling, \"the question is repeatedly put, ' Hvorledes smager Engelskmandens Vin ? ' and, instead of a polite answer, a good deal of irritation is exhibited.\" \" You English are an odd people,\" said the Amtmand ; \" you are fond of teasing.\""], [69, "57 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Teasing has its uses sometimes, Herr Amtmand,\" said Stirling. \" Possibly,\" replied the Amtmand ; \" but it is not the kindest course to take as a rule. I, however, want to talk to you about my American friend, Herr Tyssen. He wants to see some salmon-fishing, but has no intention of trespassing on you more than a day or so. He has neither rods nor tackle, and it is scarcely worth his while to pro cure them, as his father's wish is that he should travel in Norway.\" \" He can stay with me as long as he pleases,\" said Stirling ; \" and as for fishing gear, I have enough and to spare, and we will try for a salmon this evening. As you, Herr Amtmand, might like to take one back to Nordal, Jacob Oppedal will have the boat ready at six o'clock.\" \" Thank you, Mr. Stirling,\" said the Amtmand, \" you will oblige me.\" \" And I beg to thank you very much,\" added Tyssen ; \" but may I see your salmon flies and tackle ? \" \" There they are,\" replied Stirling. \" These gaudy flies with silver bodies are what the salmon fancy just now, but their taste varies from causes which are difficult to describe or learn.\" \" They are very large flies,\" remarked Tyssen. \"Yes, they are,\" said Stirling ; \"but the river is large and the early fish are large also. We are obliged to use"], [70, "58 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. twenty-foot rods, and reels holding one hundred and fifty yards of line.\" \" What are the lines made of ? \" asked Tyssen. \"Those I use are made of cotton,\" replied Stirling. \" My lines are dressed so that they run easily through the rings of the rod and do not hold the water.\" \" Do you use a minnow for salmon ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Occasionally,\" replied Stirling. \" It may be, how ever, that I take an extreme view as a salmon-fisher, but I do not consider it so sports man- like as fishing with a \" How the salmon must appreciate such distinctions,\" said the Amtmand. \" I consider it is the view a gentleman would take,\" said Tyssen. \" I can understand it is more difficult to kill a salmon with a fly, and consequently more sport.\" At six o'clock John Stirling took down a salmon-rod from its place in the verandah ; he examined the casting line carefully and put on a fresh fly. \" I think,\" he said, \" we will only take one rod, as you will see how and where I fish, and to-morrow my own boatman, Jacob Oppedal, shall be at your disposal, and I will take another man and boat.\" The Amtmand declined to go in the boat, as he said he would prefer being on the bank watching them, and, moreover, he wanted to see the Landhandler at the station."], [71, "59 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Jacob Oppedal and his boat were waiting at the head pool of the river, and as Stirling and Tyssen stepped into the boat, he rowed it into a position for fishing the pool. The pool at its head was a strong rapid, but it grew less swift at the middle of the pool, although the stream was there strong, and obliged Jacob Oppedal to keep the boat at some distance from the water he knew Stirling would fish. This made long casting a necessity, and John Stirling made long slow casts, fishing appa rently in a lazy manner, but in reality making his fly fish a considerable quantity of water at every cast. \" I shall be unable to throw so long a Une,\" said Tyssen. \" Watch me,\" said John Stirling. \" You will see the fly and casting-line are drawn to the surface when I am about to make a fresh cast ; the rod is then thrown slowly back, but strongly, and is then thrown forward in a similar manner. The thing to recollect in such long casting is that the fly must have time to get well back, or it will not fall well on the water in making the cast : it cannot be done in a hurry.\" \"It appears easy enough,\" said Tyssen; \"but it is rare, I expect, to see a Une so beautifully thrown. I fancied I saw a salmon rise about a hundred yards below us.\" \" Yes, I saw him,\" said Stirling ; \" but it is best to fish down steadily, as there is more than one fish in the pool.\""], [72, "60 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. When John Stirling had his fly nearly down to the place where they had seen the salmon move, there was a flash in the water like a ball of silver, and a salmon showed its back above the surface as it took the fly. The reel ran out as the fish played hard, and John Stirling, sitting down in the boat, wound up and gave line as he saw necessary. \" He is going down, Jacob,\" he said ; \" we must gaff him in the next pool : let the boat go.\" The boat, when in the rapid succeeding the pool, shot down with great speed, and Harild Tyssen thought the salmon was lost. But Stirling had wound up his line short, holding the top of the rod over the salmon as it was swept down by the swift water, the current taking the boat at nearly the same pace. When in the next pool, Stirling gave the fish line, but the fight was over ; the boat was run ashore and the fish gaffed. \" What a splendid fish ! \" exclaimed Tyssen ; \" he is as bright as silver, and appears as fat as can be.\" \" He is an early fish,\" said Stirling, \" about twenty seven pounds, and is just what I wanted for the Amt mand.\" \" I saw you catch that fish,\" said the Amtmand, coming up ; \" but what interested me was the way your fly played in the water. It appeared to open and shut like a butter fly spreading and closing its wings. I could see it in the clear water from the rock above.\""], [73, "61 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Some salmon-fishers,\" said Stirling, \" say that the fly should not be worked in that way ; but, for my part, I have always found the fly so played more attractive. This fish, at any rate, has succumbed to that attraction ; and it happens to be a good fish for you to take, Herr Amtmand, to Nordal.\" \" Thank you,\" said the Amtmand ; \" my wife will be glad to know you recollect her.\" \" Cut some birch boughs, Jacob,\" said John Stirling; \" tie up the fish in them, and, as you go home, leave it at the Landhandler's. We have disturbed this pool,\" he added, to Harild Tyssen ; \" we will, therefore, go down to the next and you can try your hand at it there.\" The great length of the rod and want of practice em barrassed the American. However, under John Stirling's directions he gradually improved, but could not cast a sufficient length of line. \" Now,\" said Stirling, \" you are at a place where we frequently rise a salmon ; let me cast the line for you, then I will pass you the rod and you can work the fly round.\" As Harild Tyssen was following this suggestion there was a splash in the water, a great tug at the line, and a salmon jumped out of the water. \"He is gone,\" said Stirling ; \"you had your hand tight on the line, so it would not run. He has broken away"], [74, "62 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. with half the casting-line and the fly ; but that is soon remedied.\" \" I never felt so interested in any sport in my life,\" said Tyssen ; \" I lost my head when the salmon rose and did as you say. I fear, however, I am putting you to expense by losing your excellent flies and tackle.\" \" If you are here a day or two,\" said Stirling, \" you will lose plenty of tackle and smash a rod or two before you get into the way of it ; hut I have ample, and my friend's friend is welcome. I like the Amtmand and his family. His wife and daughters are excellent women. The eldest daughter Emilie has done so much official work for her father that at times she talks like a man of busi ness, and I like to hear her ; yet there is a soft delicacy of manner that is very charming.\" \" You are right,\" said Harild Tyssen ; \" I never met with people who have so attracted me.\" \" The likeness of the three sisters,\" added Stirling, \" is extraordinary. They have all the same cast of thought and manner, and the same eyes, that remind me of the flower we call in England ' love in a mist.' It is impos sible to think otherwise, when you see them, than that anything but the purest thoughts can flash through such eyes.\" \"They are like the polished corners of the temple,\" said Tyssen. \" It is Fru Nordal that has formed their characters. Everything that tends to worry or irritate"], [75, "63 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. appears banished from the home, and nothing interrupts the trust and love the Amtmand and his family have for each other. There is no mention of confidence, because there are no secrets. I think it is due to Fru Nordal that such a happy state of things exists. There is a sincerity about her that has a calming influence.\" \" Very true,\" said John Stirling. \" What strikes me is the simple, open manner she has of being always good and useful. But, as we are not likely to rise another fish to night, we had better go to land and try again at three o'clock to-morrow morning.\" \" Shall we miss seeing the Amtmand before he leaves ? \" asked Tyssen. \" No, certainly not,\" replied Stirling ; \" we shall return at eight, and he is to breakfast with us at nine.\""], [76, "64 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. CHAPTER VI. Bor jeg i den lave Dal Hvor en Elv l0ber let gjennem skovrige Sletter. I live in the low valley Where a river runs by wooded banks. J. N. Brun. The next day Harild Tyssen found it difficult to get up when called by the Englishman's boatman at two a.m. ; but a refreshing cup of tea had its influence. \"Your boat will start from the middle pool,\" said John Stirling, \" and my man, Jacob Oppedal, will go with you. He has rowed me on the river for years, and understands where the salmon are likely to rise as well as I do.\" \" Thanks, Mr. Stirling,\" said Tyssen. \" I fear I shall not do much beyond damaging your rod and tackle ; but I feel like a school-boy just home for the holidays, and shall enjoy the fishing immensely.\" \"I shall fish the upper waters,\" said Stirling; \"and,"], [77, "65 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. as there are plenty of fish in the river, it may be some time before I come down, as, if I catch any, it will delay me ; but if you want me, Jacob Oppedal can find me.\" Jacob Oppedal was impatient at the Amerikaner's inex perience in salmon-fishing, and repeatedly rowed close to the bank and lectured him severely. He held up John Stirling as a model, not only in fishing, but as a king amongst men, and was so earnest that Tyssen began to think that the opinions he had heard expressed by the Frakener Nordal about Stirling wanted correction. At length, as Tyssen could not cast a sufficient length of line to fish the middle pool, Jacob Oppedal made him trail the fly after the boat as it was rowed to and fro across the stream. Suddenly the reel whizzed and a salmon sprang out of the water. \" Han er ikke saa stor enda,\" said Jacob ; \" he is not so very big. But forsigtig, forsigtig ! be careful ! he is not gone yet.\" \" I wish I knew what he was going to do,\" exclaimed Tyssen, in great excitement. The fish did not sulk a moment, but kept running, and, afraid of losing the fish, Harild Tyssen kept too light a hand on it. \" Forsigtig ! forsigtig ! \" roared Jacob again and again, at every fresh rush of the salmon. \" Had we not better land? \" asked Tyssen. \"No, no!\" shouted Jacob; \"you will be hours 5"], [78, "66 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. playing a fish like that. Dad og Pine ! can't you hold the rod up ? \" Time went on, and there seemed no prospect of getting the fish in, when Jacob Oppedal caught sight of Stirling up the river ; and, although Jacob's shouts could not be heard for the sound of the river rushing over its rocky bed, his gesticulations were observed, and Stirling's boat shot down the river and landed him opposite Tyssen's boat. \" Is it a big fish, Jacob ? \" asked Stirling. \"No,\" replied Jacob ; \" twenty pounds, maybe. Men han er saa st\u00e6rk som Fanden selv \u2014 he is as strong as the old gentleman himself.\" \" Then come to land,\" said Stirling. As Harild Tyssen was in the act of stepping out of the boat, the salmon made a fresh rush, taking out much line. \" Nu gaar han sin Vei ! \" shrieked Jacob ; \" he is gone ! \" \"Do take the rod, Mr. Stirling,\" said Tyssen; \"I cannot manage him. He is not gone yet.\" \" If you watch me,\" said Stirling, taking the rod, \" you will kill your next fish in half the time.\" The great length of line Tyssen had allowed the fish to take out was slowly and steadily wound up and the fish drawn within reach of the Klip (gaff) in Jacob Oppedal's hand, and was quickly landed."], [79, "67 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" I guess him to be eighteen pounds,\" said Stirling ; \" but fish of that size often play hardest.\" \"He did play hard,\" said Tyssen; \"I should never have got him in.\" \"Yes, you would,\" said Stirling; \"but you want to learn how the strain of holding the fish should bear on the rod. It is very like dealing with a fresh horse with a hard mouth.\" \" I cannot say how much obliged I am, Mr. Stirling,\" said Tyssen, warmly. \" It is the finest sport in fishing I ever enjoyed.\" \" Then, if you are obliged to me,\" said Stirling, \"do for goodness' sake leave off calling me ' Mr. Stirling.' My name is John Stirling, of St. Boss, Cornwall.\" \" I will gladly,\" said Tyssen. \" Well, then, Tyssen,\" said John Stirling, \" I think we had better go in and prepare to meet the Amtmand at breakfast. We shall have time for a dip in the Fos pool.\" The Amtmand was much amused at Harild Tyssen's excited description of the morning's fishing. \" If I had only known what he was going to do,\" he said, \" I should not have cared ; but I never knew what to expect. He jumped out of the water without my having the least idea he was going to do it.\" \" You surely did not expect the salmon to tell you,\" said the Amtmand, laughing. 5 *"], [80, "68 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" No ; but I thought I ought myself to know what he was going to do,\" said Tyssen. \" All fish play differently,\" said Stirling, \" and you can do no more than be prepared for anything that may happen.\" \" Have you caught any fish yourself, Mr. Stirling ? \" asked the Amtmand. \" Yes, I am glad to say I have caught one,\" replied Stirling, \" as it will give me the opportunity of sending it to your old friend, Provst Simonsen, if you will take it in your Kariol. It is about the same size as the one we caught yesterday.\" \"A thousand thanks,\" said the Amtmand; \"this is indeed kind. But when will you come and see us ? \" \" Whenever I may,\" replied Stirling. \" When your friend Tyssen returns to Nordal, if you like.\" \" Come by all means,\" said the Amtmand, his kindly, intellectual face reflecting the sincerity of his invitation. After the Amtmand had left, Stirling proposed an adjournment to the verandah for a smoke before turning in for their mid-day sleep. \" You must have a difficulty in leasing the river from so many owners,\" remarked Tyssen. \" Yes, that is the case,\" replied Stirling. \" There are twenty-two owners, and so many disputes arise amongst them that I arrange that they shall depute one man to act for the rest, and I settle everything with him, de-"], [81, "69 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. clining to hear anything from the others. There is some trouble, but no difficulty. The people are good at the bottom.\" \" Are they as superstitious here as elsewhere ? \" asked Tyssen. \" In some cases, yes ; in some cases, no,\" replied Stirling. \" The present notion is that any faith in the Huldrefolk or Underjordiske should be decried. I have known cases where there was no doubt that the faith in what is supernatural was strong. I once observed a girl was lame, and I asked how she became so. The reply I received was that she had run away to escape punishment for some childish freak, and was in the woods three days. When found she was quite well, having eaten a quantity of whortleberries, but was very frightened. A few days after, a bad boil appeared in her leg. This was attributed to the Underjordiske, as how could she have gone lame from a boil ? Her mother asked if I could advise any thing. I examined the leg, and found that the cow doctor who had lanced the boil had cut a sinew.\" \"The attributing it to the Underjordiske might have arisen from the girl's fright at being in the woods alone,\" said Tyssen. \" She might have had fancies passing strange.\" \" Possibly,\" said Stirling ; \" and so might the cow doctor. I have repeatedly heard accidents and unusual illnesses ascribed to supernatural causes ; but, at the"], [82, "70 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. same time, I have often heard them laughed at. The actual presence of the devil is very generally believed in. There was an Englishman here with a black beard \u2014 an ugly-looking man. It was his practice to bathe in the river, and then put on a mackintosh and walk to his quarters. I was passing when he came up the river's bank one day, when I heard a woman shrieking, ' Nu kommer Fanden \u2014 the devil 's come ! ' Her state of terror was such that there was no doubt of her faith on the subject.\" \" To change the topic,\" said Tyssen, \" what trout fishing is there here ? \" \" In the river the trout do not appear to thrive,\" replied Stirling, \" and Jacob Oppedal's theory is that it arises from the coldness of the water in summer, the swiftness of the stream acting like a cold wind on the fish. The trout are subject to an ulceration of the sto mach, but I am not clear how it arises. I do not think it is cold alone that produces it. The trout that have this ulceration are at once known by their appearance, although I confess I cannot myself recognise it. They are then called ' spedalsk,' or leprous, and are considered not only unwholesome but poisonous. With regard to the river trout, when the salmon run the trout go up the smaller streams or to the lake.\" \" Is there any fishing in the lake ? \" asked Tyssen. \"You can get some good trout by spinning,\" replied"], [83, "71 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Stirling, \" but few only. In the smaller streams on the Fjelds a very large quantity of small trout may be caught with a fly. They are like the Scotch burn trout. A red palmer, with a bit of gold tinsel at the bend of the hook, is as good a fly as any.\" \" The Amtmand told me there were many char in the lake,\" said Tyssen. \" Is there any sport attached to them?\" \"The char in the lake are small,\" replied Stirling. \" They are generally caught by whiffing. A bit of fish skin or parchment, or a small earthworm, is put on a leaded hook, called a ' dorg.' This method succeeds. When I wish to have any char to eat as a change from salmon, I send a boy out in a boat, and he generally catches two dozen in an afternoon.\" \" Do you get any sea fish in the Fjord? \" \" The river pours such a mass of fresh water into the Fjord that few sea fish, except rock-cod, are caught in any quantity. I tried catching these cod with hand-lines, as we use for whiting on the English coast ; but the hauling up of a line of three hundred and fifty feet in length, which the depth of the Fjord necessitates, is very tiring. I therefore hit on the plan of setting a long line, with two hundred hooks on it, close to the rocks. A difficulty arose as to bait; but I met this by using a common earthworm. A little rock-cod would take this, thus baiting the hook for a larger rock-cod, and it has not"], [84, "72 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. been at all unusual for us to catch three rock-cod on a single hook thus baited. But if I might suggest,\" added Stirling, knocking out the ashes of his pipe, \" I think it is time for you to get a little sleep, after getting up so early. We dine at three, which gives time for dinner and getting ready for fishing in the evening.\" Harild Tyssen remained a week at Vange, and his natural quickness and fondness of the sport soon enabled him to fish fairly well. Jacob Oppedal's bitter reproaches when he lost a fish assisted in this. Jacob would say, \" Now, Stirling, he is en pen Mand (a pretty man) ; han er ikke dum (he is not stupid) ! \" making a great em phasis on the pronoun. The plain way of living adopted by John Stirling, and the hard exercise, made a great change in Harild Tyssen. His figure appeared to get more firmly-knit and his step quicker. His liking for John Stirling grew. The English man's accurate truth in everything he said, and his kind but manly character, won the American's esteem. He wondered less at Jacob Oppedal's worship of him, and his always calling him by his name simply \u2014 for to Jacob John Stirling was not a master, but an object of attach ment, the result of many years' intercourse. The days passed pleasantly at the fishing-station. At breakfast, as Harild Tyssen related his fishing experi ences of the night before, John Stirling would put in a suggestion or a hint, which showed how closely he had"], [85, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 73 studied the sport he loved. After dinner there was always time for a smoke in the verandah, and for that pleasant conversation which arises when two men who have seen much are thrown together. John Stirling liked the thoroughness and sincerity of the young American, and the earnestness with which he always acted. The first run of salmon up the river had taken place, and it would be a week or ten days before the next rum of fish. The weather had become cooler, and as a con sequence the river was lower, the Vange Elv being fed by the melting of the snows in the interior of Norway. This lowness of the river would also retard the second run of fish. \" Tyssen,\" said John Stirling, \" the river is sulky ; let us go and visit the Amtmand. It is useless fishing until the next run of fish.\" \" We shall have to give him some notice,\" said Tyssen. \" It is not necessary with the Nordals,\" said Stirling. \" They will make no difference for us, and if they have anyone with them, we can go to the hotel at Nordby. The Amtmand's daughters will like our coming unexpectedly ; their even life is dull.\" \" You appear to know more about the Nordals than they do about you, Stirling,\" said Tyssen, \" and I cannot understand it.\" \"lean,\" replied Stirling. \" They hear a lot of gossip"], [86, "74 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. from the people, and this fills their heads with nonsense, while I use my own head, and am a quick observer.\" \"You are right, Stirling,\" said Tyssen; \"what they told me about you was gossip.\" \" We will send Jacob Oppedal to order a couple of Kariols, and leave after dinner,\" said Stirling."], [87, "75 CHAPTER VII. Du gamla, du friska, du Pjall hoga Nord, Du tysta, du gladjerika skona. Jag helsar dig vaneste land uppa jord, Din sol, din himmel, dina angdar grona. Thou old, thou fresh, thou Fjeld high north, Thou silent, thou gladly rich in beauty, I hail thee, kindliest land on earth, Thy sun, thy heaven, thy green swards. Swedish Folk-Sokg. It was eight o'clock at Nordal. The Amtmand was sitting on a garden-seat, smoking his large porcelain pipe ; his wife was at his side, knitting ; his daughters were walk ing up and down on the garden-paths. The evening had that calm coolness that succeeds a warm day in Nor way. The distant Fjelds were shading to a violet tint, and the Fjord was like a mirror. There was a distant hum from the little town of Nordby, and the occasional cry of a sea-bird from the Fjord. \" There are two Kariols coming up the post-road, little Father,\" said Fraken Ernilie."], [88, "76 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" It is Harild Tyssen and the Englishman,\" said her father. \" The first run of salmon is over, and they have left for that reason, and have come to us. I have been expecting them for the last two days.\" \"Go and welcome them, Emilie,\" said Fru Nordal, \"and bring them to your father ; he has been much occupied to-day and is tired.\" \"It is pleasant to read a welcome in such a face as yours, Froken Emilie Nordal,\" said John Stirling, in Norse, as he stepped from his Kariol ; \" a drive of four hours is dull when one cannot converse with a companion in another Kariol, and thus it is that your bright look has a greater charm.\" \" You speak Norse better than you used to do, Herr Stirling,\" said Freken Emilie. \" My father has sent me to welcome you and Herr Tyssen, and to say we have ex pected you and are prepared and glad to see you both. My father is in the garden, tired out with work, and resting : please come.\" Stirling and Tyssen followed her, and were warmly received by the Amtmand, the Amtmandinde, and their daughters. \" I cannot say how kind Mr. Stirling has been to me, Herr Amtmand,\" said Tyssen. \" I have wasted his goods and destroyed his substance in the way of fishing-tackle, only to find a more ready and kinder invitation to use it.\" \" I have not the 4east doubt of that,\" said the Anit-"], [89, "77 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. mand ; \" I have heard for years too much of Mr. Stirling not to know what to expect from him, and I thank you, Mr. Stirling, for your goodness to the son of my old friend, and I am glad indeed to see you at Nordal. Stay with us as long as you like ; and if you go, come again. There is one thing that you will always find here, and that is a welcome.\" \" Thank you, thank you,\" said John Stirling ; \" it has been a pleasure to have Tyssen with me. He has inte rested me much, and a friendship has commenced which, I hope,\" added he, turning to Harild Tyssen, \" may last. What do you say, Tyssen? \" Harild Tyssen took John Stirling's extended hand, and said, \" Thanks, Stirling, a thousand times.\" \" Good,\" said the Amtmand, adding a Norwegian ex- pression. The Amtmand's daughters looked at Stirling and Tyssen with interest : each was a type of the land of his birth. The Englishman's frank open face, lit up by the earnestness of the moment, appealed to their sympathies ; while the American, reflecting the same thoughts, no less impressed them. For a moment no one spoke ; but the Amtmand, awakening to what was more material for the moment, exclaimed : \" Men Emilie, Aftensmad, Aftensmad (supper). They have been four hours coming from Vange, and, conse quently, require some refreshment.\""], [90, "78 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" It is ready, little Father,\" said his daughter. At supper the Amtmand drew out Harild Tyssen to relate his fishing experiences at Vange, and, in doing so, he mentioned Stirling in so favourable a light that it contrasted strongly with the gossiping stories the Nordals had heard of him. \" A lad,\" related Tyssen, \" came one day at breakfast time with a bowl of wild strawberries, and, as Stirling was bathing in the Fos pool, I offered the lad a krone, but he would not accept a cent. He pointed to a long white scar in his forehead, and said that he had fallen on a rock on the Fjeld and skinned his scalp so badly that the district doctor had no hopes of his life, but that Stirling, in ten days, by constant care and skilful bandaging, had cured the wound. Jacob Oppedal told me the lad was the only son of two old people who were in grief about him, and that their glad faces, when they saw the lad would recover, was beyond description.\" \"I wish you would not talk so much about me,\" said John Stirling ; \" surely you can find another topic ? \" \" Yes, but I will say this much,\" said Tyssen, \" Jacob Oppedal told me that for the ten days you were attending to the lad you did not wet a salmon-fly, as all your time was occupied in contriving fresh bandages to gra dually induce the scalp of the boy's head to return to its place ; and, as your fingers were not accustomed to the use of a needle and thread, it was only after repeated"], [91, "79 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. failures and hours of time that you made a bandage that would answer.\" \" I am sure that is enough, Tyssen,\" said John Stirling, with some impatience ; \" why, this occurred two years ago.\" \" It is quite true, every word of it,\" said the Amtmand. \" I know the people ; it is Ole Svendsen Berglien. They live a little way up the Fjeld from the Vange Elv: they have a S\u00e6ter on a steep Fjeld, where a fall is likely to happen to the most sure-footed.\" \" Yes, yes,\" said John Stirling, impatiently ; \" please say no more about it.\" \" It gives us great pleasure to hear this of you, Herr Stirling,\" said Fraken Emilie Nordal, with sincere ap proval in her blue eyes. \" Yes, but it is no isolated instance, Freken,\" said Tyssen ; \" when he is not present I can tell you more about him. He is getting vexed now, or I would go on.\" \"We understand you perfectly, Herr Tyssen,\" said Fru Nordal ; \" you want to inform us that Herr Stirling is different to what we led you to expect.\" \" That 's a fact,\" said Tyssen, in his quick American manner. \" Well, well,\" said the Amtmand ; \" I fear Mr. Stirling will think we are all getting too personal. But now, Amalie, what can we do to entertain these young people ? You are always ready to suggest.\""], [92, "80 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" The question is, what they would like themselves,\" said his wife, looking at her two visitors and daughters ; and, as there was no reply to her look of inquiry, she added, \" Herr Tyssen has seen the Fos, but it would be a pleasant excursion for them to Vaagso, the little lake on the Fjelds, and we could arrange a dance in the evening after their return.\" \" Bravo ! Mor (a contraction of Moder),\" said the Amtmand. \" Mr. Stirling can fish the B\u00e6k from the lake for trout. We will not expect him to catch enough for Aftensmad.\" \" I should so like to see Herr Stirling fish,\" said Fraken Emilie. \"What do you say, Mr. Stirling?\" asked the Amt mand. \" Dispose of me as you will,\" replied Stirling ; \" I will fall in with anything, and will fish the B\u00e6k and catch fish enough for Aftensmad.\" \" Do not depend on that, Amalie,\" said the Amtmand who was always afraid there would not be enough for his guests to eat. \" If it were salmon we were going to fish for,\" said John Stirling, \" I would not speak so confidently, but trout are not accustomed to seals.\" \" I do not see what that has to do with it,\" said Froken Emilie. \" The explanation is easy,\" said Stirling, smiling."], [93, "81 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" The bright eye of the seal can be seen a long way, and if you and your sisters were by the side of a salmon river, the fish would rush in terror to the Fjord, believing you to be seals, and fishing for the salmon would be hopeless. The trout in the B\u00e6k, however, have not that experience.\" \" Godt, G-odt,\" said the Amtmand ; \" Mr. Stirling knows how to pay a compliment.\" \" I fear he knows how to flatter,\" said his wife. \" But it is not true that our eyes would frighten the salmon, little Father?\" asked his daughter Olava. \" Of course it is not true, little Ven (friend),\" replied her father. A message was sent to the Provst, giving notice of the intended excursion, to enable the Provst's daughter Agathe to join it with Kapellan Hansen, should they wish to do so. As the evening advanced, Fru Nordal placed a Bible before the Amtmand, who read a chapter, and afterwards said the accustomed Aftenban, with a clear voice that lingered in John Stirling's recollection as an echo of truth and faith. The next day, when Stirling entered the Dagligstue, or sitting-room, there was the same sense of home and calm happiness as had impressed Harild Tyssen. Fru Nordal's kindly manner and her daughters' atten tion to their guests was a contrast to John Stirling's rough and ready manner of living at Vange. 0"], [94, "82 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"What excellent coffee, Fraken Emilie, and how clear! \" said John Stirling, who was accustomed to make his own as thick as pea-soup. \" I wish you would teach me how to make coffee.\" \"Nothing is more simple,\" replied Froken Emilie. \" The beans are roasted and ground at once, then put into a muslin bag and boiling water added.\" \" Yes, but there must be a deftness in your fingers,\" said Stirling, \" and an exquisite tenderness of manage ment that leads to such perfect coffee.\" \" He is laughing at you, Emilie,\" said Fru Nordal. \" If he does,\" said the Amtmand, \" I like to hear him ; he does it well.\" \" Now, Stirling,\" said Tyssen, \" the day is bright and clear, and the trout will be difficult to catch in the B\u00e6k.\" \" When the trout are not caught, then exclaim,\" said John Stirling, who had been looking out the finest casting line in his book, and putting on some little bright flies with gold tags. Froken Agathe Simonsen came in with Kapellan Han sen, and were introduced to John Stirling. \" Are you the missionary that is to be eaten cold ? \" said he. \" Oh ! no,\" said Froken Agathe ; \" he is not indeed.\" \"No,\" said the Kapellan; \" that destiny is objected to on Agathe's part, but I should prefer it to being stabbed with spears and thrown into the sea.\""], [95, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 83 \" Oh, no ! Karl dear ; you are not to be stabbed with spears and thrown into the sea ! \" exclaimed Fraken Agathe, with much earnestness. \" I think, Herr Amtmand,\" said Stirling, \" that there are other people in the world besides the English who are fond of teasing.\" \" Yes, yes,\" said the Amtmand ; \" but kj\u00e6reste Folk (engaged people), you know, always tease each other: it is the old story ; the quarrel of lovers is the renewal of love.\" The path up to Vaagsa, or Vaag lake, led by a succes sion of cascades, and was steep in the extreme. \" There is small chance of trout here, Stirling,\" said Tyssen, wiping the perspiration from his face. \" Wait until we get to the plateau above,\" said Stir ling. \"It is eighteen hundred feet above the Fjord; the B\u00e6k there runs for about a couple of English miles com paratively level, then the lake is reached. The B\u00e6k is on the plateau, and as large as an English trout stream, with occasional broads, in which the fish are abundant. These broads are sandy shoals and suit the trout, which here rise freely. Flies are in clouds, and afford at this time of the year the principal food of these small trout, and, no doubt, conduce to their being so numerous.\" \"You will let us see you fish, Herr Stirling ?\" asked Fraken Emilie Nordal. \" Certainly,\" replied Stirling, \" if you wish it ; but so 6 *"], [96, "84 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. many light-coloured dresses passing by the B\u00e6k will make the trout fear you are Huldrefolk, and will appear as terrible to them as your bright eyes would to the salmon. If you will go on to the Guldsten, where you are going to have lunch, in about a couple of hours' time I will join you.\" \" The fact is,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" Stirling does not believe in the presence of so many ladies when trout-fishing.\" \" \u00c6rlig talt (honestly said), I do not,\" said Stirling ; \" and, moreover, I want to catch some fish for the Amt mand.\" \"Men kun jeg? \" besought Fraken Emilie. \" Only you ? \" said John Stirling ; \" yes, if you will sit still on the bank and only move to put the fish into the basket as I throw them to you from the river.\" \" Som De befaler \" (as you will \u2014 but with the fuller meaning of perfect obedience). John Stirling put up his fly-rod and fished the first pool they reached, but the trout had seen something un usual on the bank and had sought concealment. The water was as clear as crystal, and, as John Stirling said, he might as well have cast his hat in as his flies. \" Stirling is right,\" said Harild Tyssen ; \" let us go on.\" The next pool was in a broad gorge, and John Stirling, placing Fraken Emilie Nordal behind some juniper-"], [97, "85 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. bushes, stepped into the water and fished the shallows, taking a small burn-trout at almost every cast. \" How many have we, Fraken Emilie ? \" asked Stirling, as he came to where she was sitting, fearing to move, with her hat off and her full growth of yellow hair making her look like a very Huldr to enslave the hearts of men. \" Twenty-seven,\" she replied. \"We will go to the next pool; we shall catch more there,\" said John Stirling, walking with his boots squelching out streams of water. \"Your feet are wet, Herr Stirling; is it well?\" she asked. \" I am accustomed to it,\" replied Stirling. \" When you are at lunch I shall retire and give my stockings a twist.\" When they joined the merry party at the outlet of the lake, Harild Tyssen asked : \" How many trout, Stirling ? \" \"About sixty very small ones,\" he replied. \"It is en tirely due to Fraken Nordal that I caught any : her con duct was excellent, and, moreover, she sat like a Huldr and bewitched the fish.\" \" I never saw anything like the way Herr Stirling fished,\" said Fraken Emilie. \" The light line fell so gracefully on the water, and at such a distance ! The little fish appeared charmed to the lure. It interested me more than I thought possible.\""], [98, "86 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Freshened by exercise, her face looked bright and animated. \" You look, Fraken Emilie, as if something very extra ordinary had occurred,\" said Kapellan Hansen. \" It is not very extraordinary to catch sixty little burn trout in two hours,\" said John Stirling, quickly, as he saw the Kapellan would suggest something by his remark. \" Oh, no,\" said the Kapellan ; \" not for an English man.\" Emilie Nordal stooped to pick a Fjeldblomst. \" We owe that fellow one,\" said Tyssen, in an under tone, to Stirling. The lake was pretty. Its banks were precipices of granitic rock, with here and there a birch or a fir strug gling for a foothold. The still water of the lake reflected the Fjelds like a mirror. A little trout now and then broke the stillness of the scene as it snapped at a fly on the surface of the lake. The occasional sound of a cattle- bell could be heard from a distant Fjeld. \" The scenery is fine,\" said Harild Tyssen ; \" but citi zens of the United States get hungry. Fraken Emilie, I am sulten, forf\u00e6rdelig sulten (awfully hungry).\" \" The lunch is at the Guldsten,\" she replied, pointing to a mass of rock partly covered with yellow moss. Ages ago it had rolled down from a mighty Fjeld above, the place of its detachment being clearly visible."], [99, "87 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Stirling,\" said Tyssen, drawing him aside, \" we owe the Kapellan one for making that suggestive remark of his ; now he is going to make a speech, and I do not hke speeches. Another thing I do not like is his always teasing that little F\u00e6stema (betrothed) of his ; now I will bet my bottom dollar he does not make that speech.\" \" You might as well try and stop a river,\" said Stir- ling. \" He has been very quiet all the way up the Fjeld, and while we have been loafing round the shores of the lake he has made up a lot to say about the British Constitution and the great Republic, but I conclude he will not make that speech.\" Harild Tyssen was particularly solicitous as to where the Kapellan should sit under the shadow of the Guldsten, assuring him that it was much better that he should sit and admire Fraken Agathe Simonsen sitting opposite to him than that he should always have her by his side. Being under the cover of the rock, the Kapellan took off his soft felt hat. \" For goodness sake, keep your hat on, Herr Kapellan ! \" exclaimed Tyssen ; \" some moss might drop on your head from the Guldsten and hurt it awfully.\" \" Oh yes, do, Karl, do,\" said Fraken Agathe ; \" and you might take cold sitting under a rock.\" The lunch proceeded with much merriment, and the time drew on when the Kapellan should appeal to \" mine"], [100, "88 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Darner og Herrer.\" Suddenly he jumped up, but not to make the accustomed knock on a glass with the back of a knife to attract attention. \" Why ! \" he exclaimed, \" it 's ants ! \" And the Herr Kapellan had to retire and inspect his clothing minutely. \"I concluded he would not make that speech,\" said Tyssen to Stirling, in an undertone. \"I observed the ants passing in files over the Guldsten and dropping on the bit of moss the Kapellan sat on. They fell on his felt hat instead ; possibly, also, he had the benefit of some that were in the moss.\" \" I fear our Norwegian friends will not approve,\" said John Stirling ; \" they are too kind-hearted to like practi cal jokes.\" The Kapellan, however, returned in good humour, and said, \" There may be irritation outside my skin, but there is none inside, Herr Tyssen.\" \"That 's a man,\" said Tyssen, in his American way; \" I was afraid of your sermon, but your text is excel lent.\""], [101, "89 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

He has been to me and described the life we might expect to lead in America, in case Karl got a call from there, and he said his father would assist.\" \" So he said before, but you did not like the idea,\" said the Amtmand. \" Yes ; but I wish you would tell Herr Tyssen,\" said Fraken Agathe, \" that we do not really think so unkindly as him as he might imagine after the ants.\" \" No one would suspect you of thinking unkindly of anyone very long, little Agathe,\" said the Amtmand. \" But will you waltz with Herr Tyssen, to show him you really are not angry ? \" \" Oh, yes, I will, or dance a polka with him,\" said Fraken Agathe, feeling she was making sacrifices for her Karl's sake, as a man who had assisted in getting him bitten by ants was not to be lightly forgiven or danced with. \" This is Fraken Thora Tobiesen, a daughter of a mer chant here at Nordby,\" said the Amtmand, introducing a handsome blonde to John Stirling, who, in his well fitting evening dress, appeared very different to his Norwegian friends than when in his fishing-suit. \" I shall be happy to dance the next or any dance with Fraken Thora Tobiesen,\" said John Stirling, bowing. \" You speak Norse well,\" said Fraken Tobiesen. \" If you can understand me it is enough,\" said"], [103, "91 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Stirling. \"But it is not difficult to understand that a lady's beauty appeals to the heart irrespective of language.\" \" He knows how to flatter,\" said Fru Nordal ; \" that we have already discovered.\" \" I like it,\" said Fraken Tobiesen, but adding, as she took John Stirling's arm, \" I hear you have been fishing to-day in the Fjeld with Emilie Nordal, and have doubt less flattered her all the time.\" \" No ; she flattered me,\" said Stirling. \" She told me my trout-flies fell on the water in a graceful manner.\" \" Emilie Nordal never says anything she does not mean,\" said Fraken Tobiesen. \" She is as old-fashioned as her father. I do not believe either of them ever says or does anything that might not appear in the news paper. Emilie acts as a Kontorist (clerk) to her father, sees people on business, and is so precise and methodical that when she is an old maid the dogs and cats she will then have will be kept in order.\" \" But she may marry,\" suggested Stirling. \" Then I pity the man,\" said Fraken Tobiesen. \" He will have to live by rule and measure. She is a machine.\" \" But I have heard of women who surrender their own views to their husband's wishes,\" said Stirling. \" Yes,\" said Fraken Tobiesen ; \" a woman will often"], [104, "92 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. give up everything to the man she cares for and marries. But Emilie Nordal has such an affection for order that she can care for nothing else.\" \" Yet,\" said Stirling, \" the impression I have of the Amtmand's house is that everything naturally fits.\" \"You English love system and order,\" said Fraken Tobiesen. \" My father says England is over- governed, and the English house-father likes being sat upon. Now, what irritates me in this house is that no one person or thing can be put out of order.\" \" But why should you wish to do so ? \" asked Stirling. \" It is the perfect peace and stillness that I hate,\" said she. \"It is like the calm of a Fjeld lake ; one longs to throw in a stone to make a change.\" \"But the Amtmand,\" said Stirling, \" is the perfection of common-sense ; his knowledge is varied and extensive, and his wife and daughters are very similar. Intercourse with them not only interests for the moment, but much is learnt.\" \" Ja, det gaar som det var smurt (it goes as if greased),\" said Fraken Tobiesen. \" But now, do not go and tell Emilie Nordal what I have said. She knows I am apt to get into trouble for my plain speaking. It will not surprise if you do tell her ; nothing ever does.\" \" If a lady be frank,\" said Stirling, \" it is a charm, and I should not repeat what a lady said.\" \"I see many Englishmen at my father's,\" said Fraken"], [105, "93 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Tobiesen. \" Some of them are so very correct in manners, and appear so Useless. Their want of knowing our lan guage may conduce to this. But I see Emilie Nordal looking at me, as much as to say, ' There is that out spoken girl again.' \" John Stirling remarked that the Amtmand's daughters did not dance. \" They will by-and-bye,\" said Fru Nordal ; \" there are so many more ladies here than gentlemen.\" John Stirling danced with other ladies whom the Amtmand or his wife introduced ; but when he thought the time had arrived when the Frokener Nordal would dance, he asked Fraken Emilie Nordal to dance the next waltz. \" Will you kindly dance with anyone who wants a partner ? \" she replied. But John Stirling, taking her hand, whirled her away into the ring of waltzing couples. \" You appeared interested in Thora Tobiesen, Herr Stirling,\" she remarked. \"Not to any great extent,\" said John Stirling. \" What a gentleman Stirling looks ! \" said Harild Tyssen to his partner, Fraken Olava. \" Yes ; but does not Emilie look nice ? We think light blue suits her. It contrasts with her light hair.\" \" She is handsome and dances well,\" said Tyssen ;"], [106, "94 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" but you are very like her, only a younger and smaller edition.\" \" My mother says all men flatter,\" said Fraken Olava. \" You must not expect us to repress all our feelings of admiration,\" said Tyssen. A few days passed very pleasantly, and Harild Tyssen declared with perfect conviction that they had had a good time. To this the Amtmand's personal friends in no small degree contributed. The hospitality of a Norseman is unstinted. One day, at breakfast, Jacob Oppedal was announced. He explained he had relations at Nordby, and had come to see them until Stirling should want him. He usually addressed Stirling in the third person, as if he was speaking to some other person about him. \" I know Stirling must want to be fishing,\" he said, \" and that he does not care much for the small trout on the Fjelds, so I have brought all the sea-gear, and can row a boat if Stirling wishes.\" \"Do you know where to fish in the Fjord, Jacob?\" asked Stirling. \" I can take him where he will get fish,\" said Jacob. \" But what about bait ? \" asked Stirling. \"There are plenty of mussels here,\" said the Amt mand. \" They are small, but the rock-cod take them well.\" \" And may we go f \" asked Fraken Sophie."], [107, "95 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" If Mr. Stirling has no objections ; but I want Emilie for an hour, and I think you will be in the way.\" \" By no means,\" exclaimed Tyssen ; \" anything to pro tect me from Jacob Oppedal's scolding when I make mistakes, and his everlasting praise of Stirling.\" \" I think they may go,\" said Fru Nordal. \" There is the large boat that would take them all.\" \" The Herr Amtmand's boat is painted a colour,\" put in Jacob Oppedal, \" and Stirling prefers the small common tarred boats. The Amtmand's boat is heavy.\" \" Get two boats, Jacob, and a man to row one of them,\" said Stirling. \" The two ladies and Herr Tyssen can go in one of them, and you can row me in the other.\" \" That is like Jacob Oppedal,\" exclaimed Tyssen, \" and like Stirling. One is always making objections, and the other likes fishing by himself.\" \" He allowed me to see him fish the other day,\" said Fraken Emilie. \" And I will take you to-day, and wait till the Herr Amtmand can spare you,\" said Stirling. \" The time will not be lost, as it will take more than an hour to bait the ' bolter,' or long line of two hundred hooks. With it we are certain to catch a few fish ; but I have not much faith this weather of getting many rock-cod in the middle of the day.\" The Fjord within a short distance from Nordby nar rowed between precipices of many hundred feet in height."], [108, "96 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Its windings were tortuous, and often, when in a lake-like expanse of water, there appeared no outlet. A part of the Fjord was called Eondefjord. Its form was circular. It looked like a black lake, from the heavy shadows of the steep cliffs surrounding it. At the outlet and iulet to Rondefjord there were narrow places in the Fjord where the water was shallower, and there was some stream. These places were the fishing- grounds. John Stirling started nearly two hours after the other boat, with Fraken Emilie and Jacob Oppedal. A little Norwegian fishing-boat is not comfortable for a lady to sit in; but John Stirling remedied that by cutting a small quantity of birch twigs, over which he placed his mackintosh. \" Will you sit right aft, Fraken ? \" said Stirling, as she stepped into the boat. \" Thank you, Herr Stirling,\" she said. \" I feel as if I were sitting in an easy-chair.\" \" Give me a paddle, Jacob,\" said Stirling, \" and pull. We shall get to Eondefjord in half the time the other boat took.\" \" Is there need of such haste, Herr Stirling ? \" asked Fraken Emilie, as the light boat shot along under the regular strokes of the two powerful men. \" I do not like going fishing and catching nothing, Fraken,\" said Stirling. \" The time is passing, and the little tide_there is in the Fjord is now at half-flood, and"], [109, "97 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. there is no time to lose. The fish only feed in a flowing tide.\" Jacob Oppedal advised fishing the lower end of the Rondefjord. The bolter, or long line, was put out, and Fraken Emilie Nordal supplied with a hand-line baited for rock-cod. \" When you feel a bite, haul up, Fraken,\" said Stirling. They shifted their place several times until Jacob Oppedal's fancy was satisfied that they were in the right spot. \" I think I felt a bite,\" said Fraken Emilie, with a look of such intense earnestness that John Stirling laughed. He hauled up the line, took off a little cod, rebaited, and handed her the line. \" The Fjord is deep,\" said John Stirling, \" but your eyes, Fraken, have a greater depth. I never saw such an earnest look.\" \"There ! \" she exclaimed, \" I am sure there is another.\" \" Yes,\" said Stirling, taking the line ; \" there is another such a look, and another such a little fish. We have a flower in England called ' love-in-a-mist ' ; your eyes resemble that flower. I remember seeing you years ago, and the same thought struck me then.\" Emilie Nordal turned away her head. A chord in her woman's heart was touched. Something in her that he liked had lived in his memory. 7"], [110, "98 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" When we return to Nordal I will make you a sketch of the flower,\" said Stirling. \" But I see the other boat coming down. They do not look as if they had caught much.\" \" How can you tell ? \" asked Fraken Emilie. \" They have shifted about and not fished at one place steadily,\" replied Stirling. \" Hail them, Jacob ; they would like to see the long line hauled.\" \" We have caught nothing, Stirling,\" said Harild Tyssen, as they came alongside. \" They do not bite well in the middle of the day,\" said Stirling. \" We have caught very few. We are going to haul the long line, and, as this will make the boat in a mess, I think Fraken Emilie had better step into your boat.\" \" Do let me stay, Herr Stirling. I wish it so much,\" she said. \" The boat will be dirty with the slime of the fish, and the jelly-fish in your Norwegian Fjords are the sharpest sea-nettles I have ever known. The stinging part is hauled up with the long line. They will not sting Jacob Oppedal through his mittens as he hauls the line, but if they stung you, you would feel it sharply. The hauling up of four hundred yards of line will also bring a lot of water with it into this little boat.\" \" Please let me stay,\" she said, looking at him ; and the blue eyes won."], [111, "99 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. John Stirling took off his coat and put it round her dress, and Jacob Oppedal hauled the long line at the bow of the boat as Stirling kept it steady with the paddles. Hook after hook came up with star-fish clenched like a hand on the bait ; there was an occasional cod, many dog fish, and a few skate. The line passed through a mass of jelly-fish, and the pendent lines of spawn were drawn up with the long line to the surface. As John Stirling was gaffing a heavy skate, Fraken Emilie touched with her finger a jelly-fish as it passed the boat. \" Don't touch it ! \" shouted Stirling ; but it was too late. \" Don't put it to your mouth,\" he added ; but he was again too late. Her lips and finger were badly stung. \" The long pink lines of the Vandmand (jelly-fish, lite rally, ' water-man ') looked so pretty,\" she said. \"Just like all women,\" said Jacob Oppedal ; \"always curious and meddling.\" \" It smarts frightfully,\" she said. \"There is nothing to be done but to bear it, Fraken,\" said John Stirling, in his practical way ; \" but keep this soft white handkerchief pressed gently to your mouth ; the intense smarting will not last long.\" \" You had better go home as quickly as you can,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" and try a little arnica and water; there is some in my room, Stirling.\" 7 *"], [112, "100 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. On their return, as John Stirling entered the sitting room with the arnica and water, he said, \" The sharp sting of the smarting is doubtless over.\" \" Yes, it is,\" said Fraken Emilie ; \" but I wish to try your remedy.\" \" Stakkels (poor) Emilie,\" said Fru Nordal ; \" but I must get some lint.\" \"Use this,\" said John Stirling, tearing up a linen handkerchief in his strong hands. \" But why tear it ? \" asked Fru Nordal. \" It makes it softer,\" replied Stirling. \" The initials on the handkerchief are ' F. S.,' \" observed Fraken Emilie. \" My sister Fanny's,\" said Stirling. \" She keeps house for me, and when I am away has a school friend with her for a companion.\" \" It is a pity to have torn up such a handkerchief,\" said Fru Nordal. \" What will your sister say ? \" asked Fraken Emilie. \" That I must give her a dozen new ones, which I will do with pleasure.\" At dinner that day, John Stirling, after thanking the Amtmand and Fru Nordal for their kind reception of him, said he wished to return to Vange the next day. They pressed him to stop ; but he was firm. \" Rather a sudden resolution, Stirling,\" said Tyssen. \" And you promised me a water-colour sketch, Herr"], [113, "101 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Stirling, that was to be executed here,\" said Fraken Emilie. \" I will send it,\" said Stirling. A few days after she received, not one sketch, but two, of the flower \" love-in-a-mist.\" Each had a different tint of blue. Under one sketch was written in Norse, \" I Skyggen (in the shade) \" ; under the other \" I Solskin (in sunlight).\" \"I cannot understand why he should have sent two sketches that differ so slightly,\" said Fru Nordal. \" It is also only a flower.\""], [114, "102 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

The most trivial things Stirling does are all chronicled up in Jacob's mind as if they were the records of a king. As an American, I"], [115, "103 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. do not like such adoration ; but Stirling is a man who inspires strong attachments.\" \" You are not telling us any circumstance about him Herr Tyssen,\" said Fraken Emilie. \" I hardly know where to begin,\" said Tyssen. \" I will mention something which I saw myself and at which I was rather alarmed. A man was cutting grass with one of the short scythes they use for the grass growing be tween the rocks on the Fjelds. The scythe was old, and the strip of steel that is welded into the backing of soft iron had got loose and thin. Somehow, in sharpening the scythe, he got a bit of this steel in his eye. He came to Stirling's place rampant with pain. At first we could do nothing with him ; he could not be kept quiet an instant. Stirling, however, directed the man's wife to bathe the eye with warm milk and water. During this operation Stirling was sharpening a thin knife of surgical steel. ' Tyssen,' he said, ' you must hold the man's head while I take that bit of stuff out of his eye. Now, my man,' said Stirling, ' that bit of steel is in the ball of your eye, and you will lose the sight of it unless you let me take it out ; all depends on your being quiet.' It ap peared ages to me before the man would let Stirling touch him ; but the firm tone of his voice at last had some effect. ' I must see it plainly first, and then I can take it out,' he said. He looked at the eye carefully, and then pressed the flat blade of the thin knife on the eye-"], [116, "104 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. ball ; its sharp edge was placed close to the bit of steel, and the roughness of the steel was caught by the sharp edge of the knife, and, with a turn of his hand as quick as thought, the bit of steel was out. Jacob Oppedal aud the Bonde's wife held his hands during the operation, and I never felt so relieved as when I could let go the man's head. The pain was gone, and, of course, he began to rub his eye, which Stirling told him not to do, as inflammation might set in.\" \" Herr Stirling must be a man to be relied on in time of difficulty and danger,\" said the Amtmandinde. \" Were not the people grateful, Herr Tyssen? \" asked Fraken Emilie. \" The Bonde's wife took out a greasy leather purse and asked what was to pay ? \" said Tyssen. \" But this ex cited Jacob Oppedal : he roared out, ' Han er ikke den Mand som vil ha' Betaling' (he is not the man that will have payment), and knocked the purse yards away.\" \" But what did Mr. Stirling do? \" asked the Amtmand. \" He gave the man's wife what I thought very necessary instructions about the treatment of her husband's eye,\" replied Tyssen ; \" and then he turned to me, and said, ' Shall we go fishing ? ' as if nothing had happened.\" \" Nor was it very much,\" said the Amtmand. \" You were not present,\" replied Tyssen : \" it was not as if he had only taken a bit of dust out of the Bonde's eye. I think, Herr Amtmand,\" he continued, \" that I"], [117, "105 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. will follow my father's wishes and go to the North of Norway, if you will kindly let me.\" \" I can give you introductions to the Embedsm\u00e6nd (literally, ' men in office ') in many of the northern towns ; but Tobiesen, the merchant here, can do better with his correspondents. They will be more practically useful to you, and it will be as well if he wrote them by post. If you call with a letter of introduction on our northern people they will receive you kindly ; but they are slow \u2014 it is best to give them a day or two's notice.\" \" Thank you very much,\" said Tyssen ; \" but can you suggest the course I should take ? \" \"There is little choice,\" said the Amtmand. \"You will have to go to Bergen, and there take the coasting steamer. You can stay at any place on the coast and take a subsequent steamer northward. It is not likely you will take many inland excursions, as there is a certain monotony about them. There is the same class of scenery, varied, it is true, but still of the same character.\" \" I will call and see Tobiesen,\" said Tyssen, \" and hear what he says.\" \" By all means,\" said the Amtmand; \"he might be able to suggest much that does not occur to me.\" Harild Tyssen called on Grosserer (merchant) Tobiesen and received much information, and an invitation to dinner, the same day. Fraken Thora Tobiesen received him, in her frank"], [118, "106 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. manner, and introduced him to her brother Karl Tobiesen, a young man about Tyssen's own age. Her outspoken manner contrasted strongly with the more reserved manner of the Frakener Nordal, and Tyssen liked it. It was more American. \" This brother of mine,\" she said, \" admires the Fra kener Nordal, but they are so like each other that he cannot attach himself to either ; he has hesitated and doubted, and is afraid of getting a Kurv (a basket, mean ing a refusal). I have advised him to propose to all three on the same day, and to hope that, at any rate, one may say Yes.\" \"My sister's tongue,\" said Karl Tobiesen, \"is always running. We should be only too glad if she were mar ried ; but everyone is afraid of her, as she is so snaksom (talkative) now, that she might in time become a scold.\" \" I like a lady who speaks frankly ; the American ladies speak out,\" said Tyssen. \" Kan v\u00e6re (may be),\" said Karl Tobiesen ; \" but we do not admire it, and, thank goodness, it seldom happens in Norway.\" When Harild Tyssen returned to the Amtmand's, Karl Tobiesen accompanied him and remained a short time, during which, it was clear, he was anxious to make him self agreeable to Fraken Emilie Nordal. \" He is in business with his father,\" said the Amtmand, after Karl Tobiesen left. \" His father is a man of prompt"], [119, "107 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. decision. No one has to wait a moment for an answer. Everything in the business is directed by his quick judg ment: the consequence is, that Karl Tobiesen, from having little to control, has acquired a habit of hesitation that will, no doubt, wear off in time.\" \"I found him very sensible and pleasant,\" said Tyssen. \" We like him very much better than we do his sister,\" said Fraken Emilie. \" Do you like him better than Mr. Stirling, Fraken ? \" asked Harild Tyssen, with a quick look. \" I have never thought on the subject,\" she replied. \" Of course not,\" said Tyssen ; \" ladies do not think of such matters, unless now and then.\" He saw he had better change the subject, and added, \" Herr Amtmand, Tobiesen told me that in Finmark and in Russian Fin land there is a good deal of heathen superstition still existing.\" \" To acquire a knowledge of the inner life of the Fins would be very difficult,\" said the Amtmand. \" It would necessitate living with them for years, and then little would be known. It would, perhaps, be better to be born a Fin. It is even now believed of them, that a Fin can throw himself into a trance and send his soul on an errand of mischief, or to inquire of the dead of the past or future. The Fins have always been suspected of witchcraft, and, for that reason, have been regarded as a separate people, in the same manner as we do the Tatars"], [120, "108 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. or gypsies. I think, however, this applies to a period subsequent to the introduction of Christianity. My reason for this view is, that in the old Sagas the more noble races are described as possessing attributes derived from their descent from Halvtrolde or Bergniser, thus pointing to Finnish legends. Also Harold Haarfager and Erik Blodaxe both married Finnepiger (Finnish women). The Fins are dark, brown-eyed, quick in thought, and rich in fancy : these qualities contrast with the blue eyed, light-haired and slower Norsemen. The sea Fins are occasionally well- grown people ; but the Finlapps are smaller and of weaker minds. Many of us attribute the rich imagery that exists in our Sagas to the admixture of Finnish blood, bringing with it a quicker fancy.\" \" Have you been brought in contact with the Fins, Herr Amtmand ? \" \" Rarely. I recollect, when younger, living for a time in Nordland on the coast. There were several families of Sjofinner, or sea Fins, also some Norse fishermen. The quicker wits of the Fins enabled them to catch fish when the Norsemen did not, and this was attributed to witch craft. The Fins had a separate burial-place in the church yard and separate pews in the church. This, of course, assisted in keeping the two races apart. The fishing had been bad, and the Norsemen complained that they saw the Fins catching fish when they could not. As a pre caution against Finnish witchcraft, they stole some earth"], [121, "109 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. from the graves of the Fins in the church-yard and rubbed their fishing-lines with it. This, they alleged, was attended with the danger that the dead would revenge themselves upon the thieves of the church-yard mould, either when they were at sea, or when they were asleep at midnight : as the dead would then come and beckon them to follow to the church-yard, and sink into the earth with them. For a time the fishing did improve, and this was stated to be due to the efficacy of the church-yard mould being rubbed on the fishing-lines. A Norse fishing-boat and crew were, however, lost in a storm, and this was ascribed to the vindictiveness of the Havmand or Drauge, at Finnish instigation. The position between the two races became strained ; but in later years the greater spread of education has lessened the chance of this recurring.\" \" What is a Havmand, or Drauge ? \" \" A Havmand is a man of the sea. Hav is our word for the sea, and figures in the legends, sometimes as a hand some mortal and sometimes the reverse. A Drauge is a vindictive sea-monster, as terrible to see as a basilisk ; and to it is attributed the power of taking several forms, but all hideous. A story about the Drauge will illustrate this tradition. There was once a Norseman called Elias, living with his wife Karen on a little Holm (rocky island) near the Lofoten Islands, and the man fished in the Lofoten fishing-grounds. One day, as he was ashore, walking along with a seal-harpoon, he suddenly came on"], [122, "110 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. a gigantic seal, which he harpooned in the back of the neck. The seal rose on its fin-like extremities and ap peared to Elias as high as a boat's mast, and looked at him with terrific hate, and, opening its mouth, showed such a set of teeth, that he lost his wits with fright. After a struggle, the seal fell into the sea, which was red dened with its blood, and, in the evening, the wooden handle of the harpoon drove ashore. Elias had bought a new boat, which he was so pleased with that he lay awake thinking about it. Suddenly, in the half-light in his hut, he saw a face glaring at him. It was the face of the seal that had so terrified him, but it was on the body of a giant. The mouth, with its horrifying teeth, grew larger and larger. Elias also imagined he saw the iron end of the harpoon in the Drauge's neck as it vanished. Some time after, as he was sailing out to the winter fishing, he heard a voice from a Skj\u00e6r (breaker) say, ' When you have another new boat, then beware, Elias.' It was a long time before he got another new boat ; and Elias's eldest son Bernt was then seventeen. He had bought the boat at a considerable distance from his home, and his wife and five children accompanied him, when he made the purchase, to assist in sailing the boat home, a distance of seventy English miles. The weather was stormy, and the sea ran very high. Shortly after he started, Elias saw a precisely similar boat sailing the same course. As it became dusk, the other boat came close to"], [123, "111 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Elias's boat, so near that they could have thrown a cheese-paring into it. A high sea then struck Elias's boat and washed it fore and aft, and, when the boat rose again, Karen exclaimed, ' Good God ! Elias ; that sea has taken Marthe and Nils (their two youngest children) with it.' The other boat came alongside, and Elias could see the crew were all corpses. Another sea broke like a Fos over Elias's boat, and, when the boat righted, Karen and another child were gone. The other boat now came closer and closer, and Elias could see a man of super natural size steering it, and that the iron end of a harpoon was sticking out of the back of his neck. With a mocking laugh, the Drauge shrieked at him, ' How does the new boat sail, Elias ? ' There was no time to reply : Elias's boat capsized, and he and Bernt and a younger son were holding on to the boat for their lives. Elias then told Bernt the story of the Drauge. In the morning Bernt was picked up as the only survivor.\" \" We have to thank the wild and weird coast for that story,\" said Tyssen; \"it is highly imaginative. It has grown out of the excitement danger brings.\" Before Harild Tyssen went to bed that night, he sent a letter to Stirling, and in it he wrote : \" It may or may not interest you, but it is possible that Karl Tobiesen, the son of the merchant at Nordby, may make a proposal to Emilie Nordal. I send this informa tion to you at the earliest practicable moment. In reply"], [124, "112 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. to a question I put, she replied that she liked him better than his sister. I have known you but a short time, but I have never met a man whom I would rather serve in any way or anything. I leave for Bergen in a day or so for the north coasting steamer.\" John Stirling's reply was short : \" Thank you very much. Come and see me on your way to Bergen and have a day's fishing.\""], [125, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 113 CHAPTER X.

Harild Tyssen observed the next day that there was something unusual in the air at Nordal. Grosserer Tobiesen had intimated that his son would call and propose to Fraken Emilie. John Stirling's conduct was a puzzle to Harild Tyssen. \" If,\" thought he, \" Stirling had any intentions in that direction, so straightforward a man would have made some sign. It must be that he is not sure of himself, and has gone away to think it over free from the influence of her presence. The way he looked at those blue eyes some- 8"], [126, "114 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. times, and the delicacy of his manner towards her, must mean something. He would not behave like that without beginning to like her.\" Harild Tyssen waited for a favourable opportunity of speaking to Emilie Nordal, and told her that he was going to call at Vange on his way to Bergen. He then spoke much of Stirling and of his true and manly character. \" You may rely on it, Fraken Emilie,\" he added, \" that if ever Stirling has any intentions of marrying, he will wait until he feels he can honestly say that he can give all his heart before he speaks a word.\" Before she could reply he was gone. \" Thank you a thousand times for your kindness to me, Herr Amtmand,\" said Harild Tyssen, as the Nordals stood by the Kariol in which he was about to leave. \" I have written my father again and again on the subject, and when the heart is full the pen floweth.\" \" Farvel, og en lykkelig Reise,\" said the Amtmand. \" Is there any message for Stirling ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Have you any, Fraken Emilie ? ;' She shook her head. \" It is a pity that people cannot make up their minds a little quicker,\" said Tyssen to himself. \" He will lose that jewel of a woman.\" John Stirling had asked him to arrive at Vange at three, in time for dinner. \"Your cheery welcome, Stirling,\" said Tyssen, \"is"], [127, "115 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. pleasant to hear ; but why need you grip a man's hand so confoundedly hard ? \" \" Did I ? \" said John Stirling. \" There is plenty of fish in the' river. Jacob Oppedal has packed a salmon for the Amtmand, to send by your Kariol when it returns to Nordby. The second boat is ready, and you can have either Jacob Oppedal or the other man to row you on the river.\" \" Thank you,\" said Tyssen ; \" but I prefer going with you in your boat and seeing you fish, and to take a cast now and then with your rod when you will let me.\" \" As you will,\" said John Stirling. \" Jacob Oppedal shall take my boat to the top pool.\" When smoking on the verandah of the little wood house after dinner, John Stirling said, \" You are going on to see the midnight sun and the places on the coast, are you not, Tyssen ? \" \" Yes ; but what I would rather see is the wild rein deer on the Fjelds, the Tiur (capercailzie) in the woods, the Fjeld and Dal Ryper, and other birds of North Europe in their native haunts.\" \" That will not fit in with a coasting tour,\" remarked Stirling ; \" and besides, it is a month too early. If you will come here when you return, you can go with me to the higher Fjelds and share my tent, and Jacob Oppedal can find quarters at the nearest S\u00e6ter.\" \"I shall be only too glad to do so,\" said Harild 8 *"], [128, "116 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Tyssen ; \" and I shall be very glad to bear all the expenses.\" \" We can share them, if you like,\" said Stirling ; but your bearing all the expenses would not be pleasant to me.\" \"The Amtmand told me something about the Fins that interested me,\" said Tyssen. \" Do you know any thing about them ? \" \" I have been amongst them,\" replied Stirling ; \" but from the difficulty of language my knowledge is from a Norse source. There are the sea-Fins who are fishermen, and the Fins and Lapps that depend chiefly on their reindeer for support. There is a notion that the Fins are very small people, but this is not the case ; and this applies also to many of the Lapps. The true Lapp is often depressed in manner and thought, but the Fins have a brighter nature. There is some admixture of the races, and the Finlapp is well grown.\" \" Do you know anything of their old heathen beliefs ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Their old religion,\" said Stirling, \" was a belief that natural elements and forces were under the control of different gods. There were gods in the heavens, and under the earth, and all nature was to them peopled with supernatural beings. The Kadnihak, for instance, were underground people, and are described as clothed in red Lapp dress, with loose hair reaching to the middle. They"], [129, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 117 were said to point their fingers and make faces at the Lapps from behind rocks and bushes. Hora-gales was the god of thunder, corresponding to the Scandinavian god Thor. Sarakka was the mother of all creation, to whom many offerings were made by women. The uni versal god was Jumala, the word being variously spelt and pronounced. Their story of the Deluge is that the world was an island floating on a mighty sea. This island was overturned by Jumala and all the people were drowned except a boy and a girl, quite young children. These Jumala carried to the top of a high Fjeld called Basse-varre, or the holy Fjeld. From these children are descended the present human race.\" \" Do you know anything of their religious cere monies ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Yes,\" replied Stirling. \" The Fjeld Lapps had offer ing-places on imposing Fjelds, the Skov (forest) Lapps in open places in the forests, or on islands on the lakes, or at waterfalls. The images of the gods were chiefly stone or wood blocks.\" \" The Amtmand told me that the Fins were supposed to be able to throw themselves into a trance,\" said Tyssen, \" and then send their souls on errands.\" \" Yes,\" said Stirling, \" that is their fetish men or rNoaider. When they lay in a trance the Devil was always supposed to be lying in wait to do them mischief ; but Starbo, the dog of Hora-gales the god of thunder,"], [130, "118 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. kept watch over the bodies of the Noaider. Each Noaide had Noaide-gazze, or attendant spirits, that informed him of everything and were his means of communication with the' gods. They were also at the service of the Noaide either for good or for evil. The Scandinavian god Thor had two ravens, called Hugin and Mugin, that flew about the world and informed the god of everything passing in the universe. There might be some connecting link in that. A Noaide, however, must have no bodily infirmity ; he must not even have lost a tooth.\" \" But none of this exists now ? \" said Tyssen. \" Historically speaking,\" said Stirling, \" until very recently ; a people so rich in fancy, living amongst such weird scenery, will long retain relics of heathenism, and they do.\" \" How did they make offerings ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Women could only offer to Sarakka, the mother of Creation,\" replied Stirling, \" and they offered to her a little of everything they ate or drank. They were not allowed to offer with the men or to see them do so ; and a story is told of a Noaide having killed his own sister because she crossed the path the men had gone to sacrifice a reindeer, and that after they had passed and not in front of them. He is said to have stabbed her to the heart with a knife, after giving her three days' respite. This is said to have been done with the approval even of the parents. The men's sacrifice was on great occasions"], [131, "119 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. a reindeer, which, like the Noaide, must be perfectly free from bodily defect. The reindeer dogs also were not allowed to be present, and a dog who escaped and fol lowed a sacrificial party was killed at once. The reindeer was led to the offering-place by a red band. A Noaide, of course, led it. He then stabbed it to the heart with one blow ; and this was an anxious moment, for if the deer was not killed at once the sacrifice was not accepted by the god. The rest of the men then drew their knives and skinned the deer. The Noaide carefully cut up the deer, taking care not to break a single bone ; if he did the sacrifice was not propitiatory. The nose, eyes, ears, heart, and lungs was the offering to the god, and the rest of the reindeer was thrown into a large kettle containing water. A large fire was made and the meat cooked. The Lapps sat round in two circles, and in devotional silence. When the meat was cooked the Noaide said, ' Jumala ! Bless the flesh of the reindeer and graciously accept our offering.' Then the Noaide and the rest of the men fell on their knees and crept to the kettle and took out some of the cooked meat of the deer, the Noaide saying, as he ate a portion, ' Dat l\u00e6 Jumala biergo (It is Jumala's flesh).' They then drank the broth, the Noaide saying, 'Dat l\u00e6 Jumala garre (This is to Jumala's health).' The reindeer-meat being all eaten, the Noaide collected the bones and placed them in a birch-bark trough called the Damen-garre, holding also the blood of the reindeer."], [132, "120 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. He then crept with it on his hands and knees to the sacrificial stone, and said, 'Gracious Jumala! accept our offering from my hand and help us.' This was the cere mony.\" \"It resembles in some respects that of the Indians,\" said Tyssen. \" What dwelling-places had they ? \" \" Earth huts in the winter, and tents of skins in the summer. The earth hut was round ; the walls were of turf. There were wooden supports to the roof, which was covered with birch-bark and turf. The floor of the hut was the earth beaten hard. In the middle was the fire-place, formed of large stones. Such huts were and are called Gammer. A Ganime was divided into four parts. Aran (the fire-place), which, as I have said, was in the middle. The space behind the fire-place was called Boassa, that is, the place of honour ; while the spaces on both sides of the fire-place were called Loaiddo, or the family's work and sleeping rooms. The fourth division was called Uske or the door-place. In the Boassa was kept the Gobdas, for which the Norse word is Runebom. It is a sort of sorcerer's drum. Another Lapp word for it is Sampo, as it is related that when the smith Ilmarinen went to Pohjola (Lapland) to pay his addresses to Louhi's daughter, then reputed to be the most beautiful woman in Lapland, Louhi insisted that the smith should make a Sampo or Runebom with a chequered and changing pattern ou the cover of the"], [133, "121 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. drum before he would give him his daughter. Louhi sings : \u2014 Hvis du kunde Sampo smede Gj0re Laaget rigtig broget, Vil jeg min Datter give Lanne med en Ma din Maie. If thou wilt make the Sampo Of proper chequered pattern, I will give my daughter, And reward with a maid thy trouble. The Runebom was consulted on important occasions by the Noaider, and their answers were of the same oracular type as have been given in other countries under the same conditions.\" \" I cannot understand how you can collect so much that interests,\" said Tyssen. \" Very easy to understand,\" said Stirling ; \" the mythic history of a people suggests much, their legends more, and a tradition once heard is seldom forgotten.\" \"You have told me much,\" said Tyssen; \"but you have not said a single word about the Amtmand or his family.\" \" I have not,\" said John Stirling, as if he had made up his mind not to do so. \" I think, Tyssen, we had better go fishing.\" \" De kommer jo sent (you are late),\" growled Jacob Oppedal, as they reached the top pool. He never liked"], [134, "122 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. John Stirling to be interested in anyone, and he disliked Harild Tyssen for that reason. The first pool was fished with no result, and Jacob Oppedal, as he let the boat drop down the rapid to the next pool, said that he had seen a large salmon rise \" ligeud fra Hammeren,\" or in a right line from an out standing rock on the river's bank. When nearly down to the place Jacob had indicated, the whiz of the reel told that the fish was hooked. \" Han er lang i Vandet,\" said Jacob Oppedal. His meaning being that as the fish showed a long silver side in the water it must be a big one. The bow of the boat was up-stream. Jacob Oppedal had kept it steady by slowly paddling as John Stirling fished. \" Get the boat round, Jacob,\" said Stirling ; \"and pull hard down the river : the salmon has run out over a hun- dred yards of line.\" The fish rushed through the pool in which it was hooked down the rapid to the next, and Stirling had some difficulty in keeping the line taut as Jacob Oppedal shot the boat down the rapid, and the fish paused for a moment to consider whether he should fight it out there or make a rush for the Fjord. \" He is well hooked, Jacob,\" said Stirling ; \" but he is going down still : let the boat go with the stream.\" The fish held its bright side against the current, and"], [135, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 123 went at such a pace down the river that the least check would have caused a break. When the next pool was reached Jacob Oppedal rowed the boat to laud. \"You have gone ashore too quick, Jacob,\" said Stir ling, sharply ; \" the fish has gone down with the stream and is not a bit played yet.\" There was no time to push the boat off again, as the fish was rushing at too great a pace down-stream to admit of a moment's delay. John Stirling stepped into the water and ran down the river, sometimes in the water and sometimes out, the salmon still running. At the end of a long deep pool it paused and turned a few yards up-stream. \"Get the gaff and stand there,\" said John Stirling, pointing to a good place from which to gaff the fish. Jacob, however, had lost his head : he hopped about from place to place, and exhibited such a desire to gaff the fish that it appeared to realise the position. \" Now, Jacob,\" said Stirling, \" you are like a flea on a red-hot frying-pan again. Don't be such a Torsk \" (cod fish, meaning a blockhead). Jacob became obedient, and gaffed the salmon. \" En pen Lax og stor er han,\" he said (a fine salmon, and big he is). \" Now, Jacob,\" said John Stirling, \" you took the boat to land without orders, and the consequence is that I have had some hard knocks.\" He unfastened his knicker-"], [136, "124 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. bockers at the knee and showed some severe bruises received from the rocks in the river. Jacob Oppedal looked as if he had been detected in a crime. \" It was a fine run,\" said Tyssen. \" There is always a big fish or two coming up with the smaller ones,\" said Stirling. \" But now, Jacob, wake up, please ; put the fish into the boat, and Herr Tyssen will try the next pool.\""], [137, "125 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. CHAPTER XL Aa Ole engang i Sinde fik At bejle til Fa'r Mikkel's Datter, Den skjonneste, som i Bygden gik ; Men om hun Godhed for hannem fatter. Now Ola once had it in his mind To court father Mikkel's daughter, The fairest that was in the town ; But it was a question whether she liked him. Emanuel Balling. Karl Tobiesen waited until the Fremmede or foreigners, as he termed them, had left Nordal. He then called and made his proposal. He had hoped to have seen Fraken Emilie first and to have spoken to her ; but, whether by accident or otherwise, he saw the Amtmand first. \" If my daughter wished to marry anyone,\" said the Amtmand, \" whom I thought it would not be desirable that she should marry, I should advise her against it. In your case, Karl, I have no objections, nor has my wife. Your father has kindly prepared us for what you have"], [138, "126 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. said, and the only thing for you to do is to speak to Emilie herself. If she says No, it is our No ; if she says Yes, it is our Yes. My view is that the happiest mar riages are those when there is attachment on both sides. If my daughter has any attachment for you she will say, Yes ; if not, No. You might suggest that we could advise and influence, but that would not create any attachment for you in her.\" \" But it may follow,\" urged Karl Tobiesen. \"It might, but it very seldom does,\" said the Amt mand. \" I do not pretend to say how sincere attachment ending in strong affection arises, but I am certain a parent cannot make it arise. My conviction is that it is in the hands of a higher power.\" \" But strong attachments sometimes turn out unfortu nately, Herr Amtmand,\" said Karl Tobiesen. \" Chiefly from the lower passions not being kept in check,\" replied the Amtmand ; \" but, be that as it may, if Emilie says No to-day, she may not another day ; and you may come here as often as you like in reason. Young men are apt to be unreasonable in such matters.\" \" Thank you, Herr Amtmand,\" said Karl ; \" you are always kind.\" Emilie Nordal was knitting by the window in the sitting-room, and rose on Karl Tobiesen entering the room. He saw at once that she saw the object of his visit. There was a slight look of fear in her face that"], [139, "127 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. did not augur well, but his honest Norse nature brought him straight to the point. \" I have come,\" he said, \" to ask you to be my wife, Fraken Emilie. I had hoped to have spoken to you before seeing your father; I have seen him, and he is most kind.\" \" Jeg kan ikke,\" she said, moving her head slowly, with an emphasis on the word han that made the negative decided. \" May I hope you will consider it ? \" urged Karl Tobie- sen. \" I was told to expect this, and I have considered it,\" she said. \"I thought of writing to you to spare your coming here ; but I thought you might consider it more becoming in me to wait until you came.\" \" Is there any other attachment, Fraken Emilie ? \" he asked. \" Is it a fair question, Herr Tobiesen ? \" she said. \" Might I hope that at a future time you might hear me ? \" he urged. \" I cannot say there is, and I cannot say there is not, another attachment,\" she replied, looking at him with the earnest look habitual to her. Karl Tobiesen then knew that her refusal was final. After he left, Emilie Nordal went straight to her father, and said, \" I feel I cannot care for him enough to be his wife, little Father.\""], [140, "128 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Then you are right to say No,\" said her father. \" Do not marry at all without a sincere attachment, Emilie ; if none comes, it is God ordering what is best for you.\" The Amtmand and his family lived their even life again. They heard repeatedly from Harild Tyssen. He wrote descriptive essays of the rapid progress he made in seeing everything ; his letters were addressed to the Amtmand, but they were read, like the newspaper, by everyone. \" He is hurrying from place to place,\" said the Amt mand, \" as if haste were all in all.\" \" But then he sees so much,\" said Fraken Olava. \" But not well,\" said the Amtmand. \" It appears to me he wants to get back as soon as possible to go on the high Fjelds with Mr. Stirling.\" \" I think it is American haste,\" said Fru Nordal, \" an affected desire to show that he is quick in his move ments.\" \" Yes, he is very quick,\" said Fraken Olava ; \" I do not think it is a bad quality.\" \" No, little Ven,\" said the Amtmand ; \" but I do not like hurry.\" \" If they go on the high Fjelds,\" said Fru Nordal, \"they will pass this. I think, Kj\u00e6re Mand, we might ask Herr Stirling to stay here a day or so on the way. He is always nice, and his never losing the opportunity of doing what is kind is what I like.\""], [141, "129 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Write him, Emilie,\" said the Amtmand. \" If you wish it, little Father\" ; and she wrote : \u2014 \" Dear Mr. Stirling, \" My father desires me to say that if you will come here on your way to the high Fjelds, he will be glad to see you. We expect Herr Tyssen, of course, but you may feel that you would not like to come without an invitation from my father. My mother desires me to say that we shall be all glad to see you. \" With kindly greeting, I remain, \" Yours, ' Emilie Nordal.

I fear I cannot now go on the high Fjelds with Herr Tyssen, as I cannot leave my sister. I will, however, bring her to Nordal, if I may, and we will return to Vange the third day.\" The Amtmand himself thereupon addressed a letter to John Stirling. \"Dear Mr. Stirling, \" We shall be glad to see your sister, and all the kindness we can show her will be a pleasure to us. We shall regard her with interest, as anything resem- 9"], [142, "130 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. bling Mr. Stirling in the shape of a lady will not only interest but charm. Bring her by all means, and let her stay with us while you are on the high Fjelds with Harild Tyssen. Thank you for yet another salmon, and believe me, \"Yours faithfully, \" Oscar Nordal.\" To this letter John Stirling replied that his sister would come, and that they both thanked him in anticipation. When Harild Tyssen arrived at Vange, after his hur ried run through the north of Norway, he was surprised to find a tall good-looking English lady following John Stirling from his little wood house as he came to meet him. \" My sister Fanny,\" said John Stirling. Harild Tyssen raised his hat, and bowed \" I am glad to see my friend's sister,\" he said. \" I have known your brother but a short time, yet sufficiently to be interested in anything belonging to him. So near an object as an only sister has a special charm.\" Fanny Stirling bowed. \"As my sister is here,\" said Stirling, \" I have had to change my mode of living, Tyssen ; you can have lunch now and dinner later. She has come from England and brought civilisation with her.\" \" You talk as if I could change anything you wished,"], [143, "131 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. John,\" said his sister. \" I not only do not wish to do so, but I could not if I did, you firm-willed man.\" \" Thanks, Fanny, sister mine,\" said John Stirling, taking her face in his strong hands, \" and bless you for your goodness always.\" \" But what will your American friend think if you behave like this, John ? \" asked his sister. \" He is a man we can trust, Fanny mine,\" said her brother ; \" he is a man that is good at bottom and kind at heart, and he will understand that my sister is very dear indeed to me. She came out here, Tyssen, from Cornwall, travelling to Hull by railway, and then by steamer to Bergen, by herself, and that at once on receipt of a letter from me to say that I wanted her very much. I met her at Bergen, and pleasant it was to see her. Thank you, Fanny mine,\" he added, holding out his hand to her. \" I hope he does not grip your hand, Miss Stirling, as he does mine,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" It is like put ting your hand into the mouth of a polar bear.\" \" I am accustomed to John,\" she said ; \" he does not know how strong he is, but a better brother there cannot be.\" \"Now, Tyssen,\" said Stirling, as they were at lunch, \" tell us about your travels to the North Pole.\" \" I went to Trondhjem,\" said Tyssen, \" and saw the \u2022cathedral, and I fancy one end of it must resemble a 9 *"], [144, "132 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. cathedral you have in England at Peterborough. An Englishman on board the steamer showed me a sketch that induced that conclusion. I also visited several Norse towns where the smell of fish was strong.\" \" What did you like best ? \" asked Fanny Stirling. \" The sunsets, succeeded so soon by the sunrise, as we went north,\" said Tyssen. \" One night never ap peared to me like another. There was each night some change of colour and effect. The scenery became mono tonous, as the Amtmand said it would ; and, to tell the truth, Miss Stirling, I was longing to get back to go on the high Fjelds with your brother.\" \" I have arranged it in this way,\" said John Stirling. \" My sister, in our absence, will stay at Nordal. Jacob Oppedal has left with the tent, camp-beds, and provi sions. He will take these things in a Stolkj\u00e6rre to Opheim, where he will hire two horses. Opheim is at the foot of the high Fjelds. He will be joined there by a J\u00e6ger, called Kristofer, whom I have engaged. They will load the tent and other things on the horses, and pitch the tent near a S\u00e6ter, twenty-two English miles from Opheim. We shall hire another horse at Nordby to take our personal luggage, and the Amtmand will lend us his saddle-bags.\" \" I shall enjoy it beyond everything,\" said Tyssen. \" We shall indeed have a good time.\" \" The men will be at the S\u00e6ter a few days before we"], [145, "133 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. are,\" said Stirling ; \" and will pick up information as to what game is about.\" \" Velkommen tilbage,\" said the Amtmand, as Stirling with his sister and Tyssen arrived at Nordal. \" Welcome back ; but we are more glad to see your sister. Let me assist her out of her Kariol,\" he added in English. John Stirling presented his sister to Fru Nordal. \" We want no introduction, Miss Stirling,\" said Fru Nordal ; \" my daughters are delighted. They have been longing to welcome you. Do you speak Norse ? \" \" No,\" said Fanny Stirling, \" I scarcely know a single word.\" \" We know very little English here, Miss Stirling,\" said Fraken Emilie ; \" my father speaks it best, but Herr Tyssen or your brother can interpret.\" \" Where there is such kindliness as you will experience here, Fanny,\" said her brother, \" you will find nothing a difficulty. Fraken Emilie,\" he added in Norse, \"my sister wishes to be placed in your charge.*\" \" Tak skal de have \" (an expression used when it is desired to slightly emphasise thanks), she said, \"and welcome back to Nordal, Herr Stirling.\" Fanny Stirling looked at her, and saw from her bright look that she was pleased to see him. The Amtmand took Fanny Stirling in to dinner and placed her by his side. Her brother sat near to interpret anything she wished to have explained."], [146, "134 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Karl Tobiesen was present. Notwithstanding his rejec tion, he had been a constant visitor at the Amtmand's. He contrived to sit by the side of Fraken Olava, and paid her great attention. Harild Tyssen, at the Amtmand's request, gave a sketch of his tour to the north of Norway, which his letters had anticipated. \" Well, Mr. Stirling,\" said the Amtmand, \" what about the high Fjelds ? \" John Stirling explained the arrangements he had made, and added, \" I should like to stay with you one clear day, as my sister wishes it. She fears she may commit some breach of manner or rule. Everything is strange to her here, and she is ignorant of your larfguage.\" \"As you will, Mr. Stirling,\" said the Amtmand; \" Emilie has arranged to do nothing else but take care of her.\" \" You may trust me, Herr Stirling,\" said Emilie Noidal. \"I know it,\" said Stirling, as he saw her earnest look. In the evening, Fanny Stirling, to the great pleasure of the Nordals, sang some English ballads. The three sisters also sang. \" They have grand voices,\" said Fanny Stirling to her brother; \" but the youngest has the most powerful. Their likeness to each other is striking : it is fortunate they do"], [147, "135 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. not dress alike. Emilie appears to have had, in some way, a different training from her sisters.\" \" She has for years,\" said Stirling, \" assisted her father as his secretary, and the society of such an intellectual man, with his clear common sense, would have had its effect on anyone, much more on a daughter who worships him.\" The Amtmand approached, puffing away at his long pipe. \" Herr Amtmand,\" said Fanny Stirling, \" I am longing, above all things, to hear a Saga.\" \" A Saga ! \" echoed the Amtmand. \" What has put such a fly as that into your pretty head ? \" he added, using a Norse phrase. \" Because I do not know what a Saga is, beyond that it interests,\" replied Fanny Stirling. \"A Saga,\" said the Amtmand, \" is often very long. It consists of recitals of legends, and, where the subject admits of it, of songs. A Saga often possesses an ima gery and pathos that is very striking, and to such a degree as to take fast hold on the imagination of Scandi navians. There is an episode in a Saga which will illus trate this, and Emilie can relate it best, if she knew sufficient English ; but if your brother will sit by you and help me when I get into difficulties, I will tell it you. The story concerns the loss of Thor's hammer, and is in the elder Edda.\""], [148, "136 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" What is an Edda ? \" \"It means an old woman, a grandmother. The god Thor awoke one morning and found that his hammer was missing. This was his chief weapon, and highly valued by the gods. The song begins as follows. Vred blev da Vingtor Der han vaagnede Og han sin Hammer Hos sig savnede. Skj\u00e6gget han rysted Rev han sit Haar ; L\u00e6nge Jordens San Ledte rundten om. Angry was tho god Thor, When he awoke And his hammer Was not by his side. His beard he shook ; The tall son of earth Searched everywhere. This language is in an older form than modern Norse, but it is taken from a yet older language. Loke, who is the Mercury of the gods, was sent to seek for the ham mer, but it could not be found in the heavens or on the earth. Loke then goes to Freja, the goddess of the Scan dinavians, and asks her to lend him her feather-dress, that he might fly in it to the land of the giants (Jat nerne), whom he suspects of having stolen the hammer."], [149, "137 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. The subject has Freja's warm sympathy, for she replies \u2014 Laane dig den vilde jeg Var den end of Salv ; Faa den skulde du Skjant den var of Guid. Lend it thee will I, Though it were of silver ; Thou shalt have it, Though it were of gold. Loke flies in the feather-dress to the land of the giants, and finds the chief of the giants, Trym, braid ing golden collars for his dogs and cutting his horse's mane. Loke tells his errand. Trym replies that he has hid the hammer in the earth eight Norse miles, or fifty-six English, deep, and that he will not restore it unless the goddess Freja will be his bride. Loke re turns, and reports the resplt of his journey. Freja was so enraged that the hall of the gods trembled at her passion, and good advice was dear. At last Hejm dal, the most far-seeing of the gods, advised that Thor should be dressed as a bride, and, accompanied by Loke, attired as a waiting-woman, should go to the land of the giants. Thor strongly objected ; but at length submitted to be dressed as a bride, with precious stones on his head, which was covered by a veil. The he-goats that drew Thor's chariot were harnessed, and the god of thunder"], [150, "138 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. and Loke left for the land of the giants. The wedding guests were assembled, and the feast brought in. Thor devoured an ox, eight salmon, and drank three barrels of mead. The giant Trym expressed his surprise at his bride's appetite. This Loke explained was due to the fatigue of the journey. The giant Trym attempted to peep under the bridal veil on Thor's head, but drew back at the fierce gaze of his bride. This Loke also attributed to the fatigue of the journey. Thor's hammer was at length brought in and laid in the lap of the supposed bride. This hammer was called Mjalner, or the Crusher ; and Thor first crushed the giant Trym with it, and then slew all the rest. The song ends with \u2014 Saa kom Odins San Atter til sin Hammer. Thus came Odin's son Again to his hammer.\" \" Thank you very much, Herr Amtmand,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" If you want to hear any more Norse legends or Sagas, Emilie can repeat many,\" said the Amtmand. \"They not only interest but influence the fancies of a people.\""], [151, "139 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

If you give the letter to the mes senger, he will put it in his Wadmel jacket pocket, and by the time it reaches me it will be reduced to pulp. Here is, therefore, a little waterproof case in which you can put the letter to prevent that. Write when you like ; and if you have little to say, write that little.\" John Stirling explained to Fraken Emilie what he had requested his sister to do, and he added, \" If you will write me, also, I shall be glad to hear from i\u00bb you. \" Is it your wish, Herr Stirling, that I should write ? \" she asked. \" Write and tell me about my sister, Fraken, and you cannot do me a kinder service,\" replied Stirling. \" Then I will do it gladly \u2014 Det vil gl\u00e6de mig,\" she said. The faith and trust in each other that existed between John Stirling and his sister was pleasant to see ; but when he took her face in his strong hands, as was his wont, and said \" Good-bye and bless you, Fanny mine,\" and his sister looked up to him like a loving child, it appealed to Emilie Nordal strongly. When John Stirling and Harild Tyssen had left for the high Fjelds, there remained for Fanny Stirling the great difficulty of language. There were several persons in Nordby who could speak English, and their assistance"], [153, "141 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. was called in. Emilie Nordal was untiring in her efforts to acquire a greater knowledge of English, and Fanny Stirling made a little progress in Norse. \" If you were to come and stay with me in England, Fraken Emilie,\" said Fanny Stirling, \"you would soon learn English. You might come home with us and remain the winter. The climate is mild, and frost and snow comparatively rare in Cornwall.\" \" Go back with you, Miss Stirling ! \" she exclaimed, with a look of surprise and pleasure. \" Yes,\" said Fanny Stirling, \" and then we could learn to talk to each other without being obliged to use the simplest sentences, and without the dictionary being always at hand. I daresay you might also learn to call me Fanny instead of Miss Stirling, and I wish you would do so now.\" \" That I cannot and could not do,\" said Emilie Nordal, with some emphasis. \" My father would let me go to England if you wished it,\" she added ; \" he could not resist any request of yours : for, although you have been here so short a time, he says you are so clear to read that he could trust you in anything ; that he well understands how your brother never opposes any wish of yours, and that he could not either.\" \" Yes, but John has his own way always, and yet his way is my way. He is strong in will and deed, as a man should be,\" said Fanny Stirling."], [154, "142 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"But would he like my going to England with you?\" asked Emilie Nordal. \" But I feel I cannot go, and that I must not go.\" \" We will discuss it with him when he returns from the Fjelds,\" said Fanny Stirling. The calm, home-like feeling that existed in the Amt mand's house was very pleasant, and Fanny Stirling liked it. The kindness with which she was treated was as thorough as it was thoughtful. The Nordals liked her. She was an English lady of a good type. She had tact, common-sense, and a bright manner. Her good looks and neat taste in dress would have won admiration any where. \" You are so nice, Miss Stirling,\" said the Amtmand, \" that we are all in love with you. When Emilie is in my room, and I see her biting her penholder in an abstracted way, I ask, ' What is the matter, little Ven ?

An Eventyr is a story of some adventure or extraordinary incident. They are written mostly in prose, beginning with the phrase ' En Gang ' or ' Once upon a time ' ; but some are in the Saga form of part recital and part song. As an example, there is the Eventyr of the daughter of King Valdemar and the son of King Alkor. King Valdemar had a stronghold on the shores of the Baltic, and his possessions consisted of a thousand ships with gilt masts and silken ropes, and accumulated plunder from the British coasts. When the sun shone on green leaves, and the cuckoo could be heard, he sailed to Britain, and re turned in the autumn with silver and gold, costly wine, and slaves. He, however, regarded his daughter Hilda as his greatest treasure. She had many suitors, but had"], [156, "144 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. secretly betrothed herself to Prince Rerik, the son of King Alkor of Russia, between whom and King Valdemar there existed the fiercest hate. When the latter departed on his expeditions to Britain, a hundred warriors remained behind to guard his daughter Hilda; and so close a watch was kept over her, that she was confined to her lady's bower and the tower above it. She, however, did not find the time long, as she danced with the hand maidens who attended her, or played her golden harp or sang, or embroidered silk with threads of gold. If she pricked her finger with her needle, she played with her little dog Issegrim. When the sun went down behind the green forest, she ascended the tower and watched the mermaids at play on the sandy shore. One evening she heard from the Linden trees a sound different to the wind blowing through their leaves. It was Prince Rerik with his harp.

Hilda's form in the air I see, When longing eyes I lift above, And deep below the pale blue sea, Reflected back, I see my love, For love strikes deep. Where art thou, Hilda ? hear the song Thus bursting from my waiting heart ; In childhood's years thou taught me song, As well as love, my own sweetheart, For love strikes deep.

He and 10"], [158, "146 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. his Vikinger held a carousal and drank ale and mead and wine. An ambassador from King Alkor appeared and demanded in proper form the hand of his daughter Hilda on behalf of Prince Rerik. King Valdemar, from the midst of his men, roared out a refusal in insulting terms, and the ambassador left in haste and fear for his own safety. Five months passed, during which Hilda wept much ; but the house-karls drank and sang. Again the sun shone on the clear wave as spring approached, and the cuckoo was heard calling merrily in the forest ; but King Valdemar was gloomy, as he feared the designs of King Alkor during his absence in plundering the coasts of Britain. He called together seven of the best men of his house-karls, and swore them to secrecy. He then directed them to make in the forest an underground chamber, to which he carried not only his treasures, but his daughter Hilda and three of her hand-maidens and her dog, little Issegrim. Wine and mead and provisions were placed in the chamber under ground. A supply of water was led from a neighbouring spring. When King Valdemar returned from the forest, his stronghold on the Baltic was already in the hands of his enemy King Alkor. Prince Rerik waded in blood to his belt seek ing for Hilda, but could not find her. King Valdemar was killed by a stone falling on him from his belea guered tower. The seven house-karls who knew where Hilda was were all slain. For five days Prince Rerik"], [159, "147 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. sought for Hilda ; and it was believed she had perished in the flames that had destroyed her father's strong hold. Rerik's grief was intense. His attendants bound him with ropes of silk to prevent suicide, and kept him so bound for six days, during which time he did not speak a single word. He then made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and during his absence his father, King Alkor, died of grief. After three years' absence, his father's ghost appeared to Rerik, and warned him that his king dom was in the hands of men who ruled badly, and told him to return at once. His father's ghost also promised him that he should meet with Hilda on the Hajenloft's Bro. [This is, literally, ' the bridge of the high loft,' but it would appear as if it were a balcony in the main hall of the palace.] King Rerik returned, and found that his subject, Count Hildebrand, had usurped his throne, and was about to marry a lady called Malfred. Cloaked as a pilgrim, King Rerik entered the hall of his palace, where Count Hildebrand was holding a carousal, and sat by the hearth. The warriors had drunk deeply of ale and mead and wine. Count Hildebrand placed a gold crown on his head, filled the drinking-horn, and called on the men present to swear fealty to him. The pilgrim threw off his cloak, and King Rerik was recog nised in bright armour. He stabbed Count Hildebrand to the heart with his dagger, and the warriors welcomed his return with shouts of joy. King Rerik, meeting 10 *"], [160, "148 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Malfred on the Hajenloft, supposed that, as Hilda was dead, his father's ghost indicated that he should marry her. MeanwhileHilda lived in the chamber under ground. Her three hand-maidens died of hunger, and she killed and ate her little dog Issegrim. There is an example here, in the Eventyr, of the imagery employed. The passing of time is described, as well as Hilda's distress of mind. De Uger henrinde, De Maaneder svinde, De Ulve tude, Det fryser saa haardt I Skoven derude ; Hvor est du K\u00e6r Fader ? Ak ! vidste du hvad jeg maa lide ?

That summer is as follows : \u2014 of the De Uger henrinde. De Maaneder svinde ; I granne Lunde, Hait galer G0jen ved Midsommer'a Stunde Hvor est du, min Rerik ? Ak I vidste du hvad jeg maa lide ? The weeks pass, The months vanish ;"], [161, "149 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. In the green groves The cuckoo calls at midsummer : Where art thou, my Rerik? Ah ! dost thou know what I suffer ? But relief was at hand. A hungry wolf, attracted by the smell of the dead bodies of the three hand-maidens, dug a hole into the chamber under ground ; but it was frightened at seeing Hilda, and fled to the forest. Hilda crept out of the hole made by the wolf, but nearly perished from hunger. The sound of a hunter's horn was welcome. The name of the hunter was Hagbart. After acquainting her with the death of her father and of King Alkor, he told her of her own supposed death, and of Rerik' s intended marriage with Malfred, to whom he (Hagbart) had been secretly married. Hilda swooned at this intelligence, and was carried to Rerik's Borg, or palace, and cared for by Hagbart's sisters. Malfred, who dreaded the discovery of her secret marriage to Hagbart, prevailed on Hilda to be dressed as bride in her place, and to be hidden in the bridal veil. At the marriage Hilda gave Rerik the ring he had given her when she had secretly betrothed herself to him under the Lindens. Supposing her to be Malfred, King Rerik returned the ring to her, and commanded her never to part with or lose it. Hilda thus realised that he yet loved her. After the wedding feast she went up to the Hajenloft, and King Rerik fol lowed and insisted on again seeing the ring and the"], [162, "150 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. removal of the bridal-veil. Hilda laughed joyfully, so that the king's hall rang again, and Rerik, to his intense surprise, recognised her. There are more incidents in this Eventyr,\" added the Amtmand, \" but I daresay you have had enough of it.\" \" By no means,\" said Fanny Stirling ; \" my interest in the story has been great.\""], [163, "151 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

The distance from Nordby to Opheim, the little sta tion at the foot of the high Fjelds, was twenty-eight English miles. The station consisted of a little inn with its out-buildings. A few houses belonging to Bandefolk were near. \" This is the station, Tyssen,\" said Stirling as they approached it. \" We have taken, as I told you we should, twelve hours to walk the twenty-eight miles from Nordby. It is never well to press a Norwegian, or a Norwegian pony, the first day ; and the two hours' rest we had half-way, and going at a moderate pace, enables us to come in at Opheim fresh and ready, after a night's rest, for a stiffer walk to-morrow. But here is Jacob Oppedal, whose orders were to stay by the tent until we came.\""], [164, "152 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" I conclude,\" said Tyssen, \" he has something to communicate, or he would not have disobeyed your orders.\" \" He does not obey orders at all times,\" said Stirling. \" Well, Jacob,\" he added in the Bonde dialect, \" what in the name of the Devil's grandmother brings you here?\" \" Stirling would like to hear,\" replied Jacob, talking as if he was addressing another person than Stirling, \"that there are no deer on the Fjelds at present, but there are some Fjeld Ryper between this and the S\u00e6ter ; and if he turns to the left at a place where I will show him, he may shoot many.\" \" I like orders being adhered to best, Jacob,\" said Stir ling. \"It cannot be far from the tent, and, if there are no deer, we might make a better day at the Ryper from the tent, with Kristofer and his dog with us, than just coming across them on the way up.\" Jacob Oppedal said nothing, but rubbed his teeth with a thin bit of birchwood fashioned like a broad toothpick. \" Now, Jacob,\" added Stirling, \" get into the station. We want fried eggs and meat cakes, or anything they have got, and we start at three to-morrow for the tent, rain or shine, and see the horse well fed to-night.\" The Landhandler at the station was interested in their expedition, and did his best to make their stay with him"], [165, "153 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. comfortable. He communicated much information about deer and bears ; but his news, when sifted, referred to years ago. \" We always have to work out our own experience, Tyssen,\" said John Stirling; \" the people wish to please us, and say what will please for the moment. We shall know more in a couple of days about the game on the Fjeld from our own observations than they can tell us with any correctness in a month.\" When Harild Tyssen went to his bed-room he returned immediately. \" Stirling,\" he said, \" I turned down my bed-clothes and I saw a lot of dark points that shifted their position. I think they are \" \"Yes, I know,\" said John Stirling, interrupting. \" They are Lopper ; but you must wait until you sleep in an old S\u00e6ter hut to ascertain how truly industrious they can be.\" \" But what shall I do ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Put on your mackintosh,\" replied John Stirling ; \" tie your trousers tight at the ankle, put a pair of socks on your hands and over your sleeve-wrists, tie your handkerchief round your neck, and then go to sleep. We start at three.\" The walk to the higher Fjelds was picturesque to a degree. There was a torrent of glacier-water as white as milk to the left of the path, and occasionally a pre-"], [166, "154 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY cipitous cliff, under which they passed or over which they mounted by a ladder-like path difficult for men and horses. In the clear air everything was distinct and well-defined. Rough stone steps, hewn out ages ago, often occurred, and up which the baggage pony had to clatter at some risk of a fall. Now and then a plateau was passed affording comparatively easy walking, while other plateaux were covered with gigantic boulders deposited by glacier action centuries since. \" When shall we reach the promised land of the Fjeld Ryper, Stirling ? \" asked Harild Tyssen. \" About mid-day,\" replied Stirling ; \" we shall most likely find them under a high precipice amongst the rocks at its foot, or where there are some dwarf willow bushes or dwarf birch. They may, however, have shifted since Jacob saw them ; and we have no dog. Setters and pointers are useless on these Fjelds. I like, myself, a terrier with an inquisitive turn of mind ; it can be carried when tired, and is easily kept supplied with food. Kris tofer has a sharp-nosed dog like a small smooth colley, but he has always to lead it with a cord, and even then he has a difficulty with it. He is generally informing it that he will cut its liver and intestines up in such small pieces that the lice will have to go down on their knees to eat them up.\" \" But we have left our gun-cases at Opheim, and are carrying our guns,\" said Tyssen ; \" if you had not"], [167, "155 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. expected to find the Fjeld Ryper you would not have done so.\" \" My reason was,\" said Stirling, \" that It relieves the baggage-pony of about twenty-five pounds weight ; but it is not unlikely that we shall meet with some Fjeld Ryper, and if we do they will make a welcome addition to our supplies ; and if they are so low down in the Fjeld we shall not disturb any deer on the [higher Fjelds.\" \" Some hours after, Jacob Oppedal halted, and pointed to such a precipice as Stirling had described. \" It is a likely-looking spot,\" said Stirling ; \" there are plenty of rocks and dwarf willows. Hobble the baggage pony, my man,\" he added, \" to the Skydskarl, and we shall want your help to beat.\" \" You would only let me take twenty cartridges from Opheim, Stirling,\" said Tyssen. \" You will not use all of them,\" said Stirling, \" as the climbing over the sharp-edged rocks will make it difficult for you to shoot. There are plenty of cartridges in the tent. Keep in line, with the two men between us ; do not take long shots, as a wounded bird is bad to get amongst the rocks. The men will probably shout and run forward as soon as they see a bird drop ; there is no preventing them, except by holding them ; but do not follow, as they will run like hares, putting up the birds out of shot.\""], [168, "156 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. As they beat through the dwarf willow-bushes a few Fjeld Ryper rose and a brace fell to John Stirling's quick shooting. Jacob Oppedal ran with a loud shout to pick up the birds, putting up several. \" Jacob,\" said John Stirling, \" you are as big a fool now as when gaffing a salmon ; keep two paces behind me.\" The Fjeld Ryper rose in a straggling manner, and Harild Tyssen missed repeatedly. \"You hold too long on your birds,\" said John Stirling; \" you should shoot as soon as they rise, for once on the wing they go like bullets.\" When the middle of the dwarf willow bushes was reached a quantity of Ryper rose, and John Stirling shot several as fast as he could load and fire. Jacob Oppedal, carried away by the excitement of the sport, was in the act of jumping forward with a shout, when John Stirling's hand was on his collar, and, as he still struggled, a trick of Cornish wrestling threw him heavily on his back. \" Du er dum som en Hest (stupid as a horse), Jacob,\" said Stirling; \"if you give so much trouble I will send you back to Vange.\" This threat, and the heavy fall, brought Jacob to his senses ; and the rest of the dwarf willows were beaten through quietly. \" We have eleven brace, Tyssen,\" said Stirling, as they unhobbled the baggage-pony."], [169, "157 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" How handsome the birds are in their summer plumage,\" remarked Tyssen ; \" the grey feathers are particularly beautiful.\" \" So Jacob Oppedal thinks ; he will keep all the softer feathers for putting inside the lining of his waist coat, his idea being that, as the Fjeld Rype can resist intense cold, that its feathers are warmer than those of other birds. Jacob's mind gets so full of excitement with anything like successful sport that he becomes un controllable ; if he could have been kept beating steadily through the willow-bushes we should have shot more birds. It is one of the very few points on which we disagree. I caught several salmon one morning, and Jacob lost his head. He rushed into the river up to his neck to gaff a salmon I had only just hooked casting from land.\" \" I never saw a man shoot so quickly or load so fast as you do, Stirling,\" said Tyssen. \" You must do it with the Fjeld Ryper, and kill them clean, or they are under the rocks in a moment. Also now, for miles, we should not find any more, and as for marking any of them down, I have seen some of the birds we have just risen fly out of sight above the sky line. I have marked one bird, however, at which I saw you fire a long shot and hit. It is under a large boulder about a mile distant on the Fjeld side ; a Fjeld Rype stands a great deal of long-shot shooting.\""], [170, "158 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Jacob Oppedal crawled under the boulder and the Rype rose. \" Shoot, Tyssen,\" said John Stirling. \" I cannot get my bead on the bird,\" said Tyssen, which immediately dropped to John Stirling's gun. \" I hope you will not mind my killing your bird, Tyssen,\" he said ; \" but it was wounded, and I did not shoot until it was nearly out of shot. Your drawing a bead on a Fjeld Rype is a process they will not wait for.\" \" I have been accustomed to shoot with a rifle,\" said Tyssen. \" You want to get into the way of shooting with both eyes open,\" said Stirling ; \" and to fire the instant your gun touches your shoulder. It is only a question of practice.\" The tent was pitched about three hundred yards from a S\u00e6ter hut, to be free from the cows when coming in to be milked. The cows become half-wild on the Fjelds, and are at times troublesome to strangers having a dog with them. Kristofer, the Jaeger, was at the tent. He was a thin man about fifty, with sharp features and a steel-blue eye. He had a sharp-nosed dog with him, black over the back but white underneath, and about half the size of a colley. \" What is the news about deer ? \" asked Stirling. \"There are none on the high Fjelds hereabout,\" replied Kristofer. \" The wind has been blowing from the"], [171, "159 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. northward, and they have gone up wind. There is no chance of deer until a shift of wind, and at present there is no sign of a change of weather.\" \" Get the fire lighted and the iron pot on,\" said John Stirling. The iron pot was about eighteen inches in diameter, and was supported by a tripod of iron rods. \" Kristofer,\" he added, \" strip ten of these Ryper, then wash them and cut each bird in four pieces and put them into the pot with water just enough to cover them. Jacob will unload the baggage -pony and put the things into the tent. Tyssen, we can go to the S\u00e6ter and get some milk, cheese, and Fladbred, as our dinner will not be ready for three hours.\" The S\u00e6ter was very similar to what has been before described. The people were kindly, but could give no information as to reindeer, and replied in dialect : R\u00e6n, han pleier at hoide sig paa de hagsta Fjella (the rein deer, he keeps himself on the highest Fjelds). When they returned to the tent John Stirling added to the slowly-cooking Ryper two tins of essence of beef, a tin of preserved vegetables, some pepper and salt, and a little more water. When at last dinner was pronounced ready, Jacob Oppedal placed the iron pot by the side of the tent camp-beds, and gave them each an ena melled iron soup-plate, a table-spoon, and some bread that had been supplied by Fru Nordal's kindness. \" My goodness, Stirling ! \" exclaimed Tyssen, \" how"], [172, "160 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. excellent ! What a pity it is that the Fjeld Rype is so small a bird.\" \" When we can get a bit of reindeer meat it will be a good addition,\" said Stirling ; \" but there is no sign of shooting a deer yet, until the weather changes, and when it does it may bring a spell of bad weather with rain and mist ; and storms up here are not zephyrs.\" \" What shall we do to-morrow ? \" asked Tyssen. \" About ten English miles to the south-east of this is a valley at a lower level. There is plenty of heather, and birch, and fir-woods. I think we might get some Dal Ryper there, and perhaps an Aarhane (blackcock).\" \" But ten miles and ten miles are twenty miles ; and shooting all day is too much, particularly when one has to pass places where the desire arises to hang on by one's eyelids, as hands and feet are not enough.\" \" We can go there to-morrow, sleep at the S\u00e6ter or on the Fjeld in our reindeer sleeping-bags, and return to the tent the day after,\" explained Stirling."], [173, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 161 CHAPTER XIV.

You will get some more milk at Lavdal S\u00e6ter, and here are some ship biscuits ; you can take as many as you like ; but if you take more than six, with your cartridges, you will find them a burden.\" \" How many cartridges shall we take ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Sixty, and a few with buckshot. It is for two days,\" replied Stirling. \"Kristofer will have to carry our reindeer sleeping-bags and some food for himself, and this will be as much as he can manage. We will leave Jacob Oppedal here, as we shall have trouble with him if we meet with any sport at all.\" Jacob Oppedal made every possible objection to re maining behind, and showed some temper. \" I understand,\" he said, \" what Stirling says, and I know he likes that Amerikaner.\" \" You are to stay here,\" said John Stirling \" Det vil jeg ikke (that I won't),\" said Jacob. Kristofer led the way with his dog Barfod. Several torrents from the glaciers were forded, and they passed through some defiles of wild and weird aspect. At length Kristofer halted and pointed to a S\u00e6ter hut on the side of a Fjeld. \" It is Lavdal S\u00e6ter,\" said Stirling. \" There is a man to the leeward of the S\u00e6ter, sitting down ; he is occupied with something.\""], [175, "163 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" It is Jacob Oppedal stripping some of the Ryper you shot yesterday,\" said Kristofer. \" There is a shorter path over the Fjeld, but meget brat og steil (very abrupt and steep.)\" \" Budeien (a term for the S\u00e6ter girl) has promised to look after Stirling's tent,\" said Jacob, in an explanatory way and speaking in the third person ; \" and the S\u00e6ter folk here will lend him an iron pot in which to cook his Mad (food).\" \" You were troublesome yesterday, Jacob, and you are going to be a nuisance to-day,\" said Stirling. \" I have such a desire at v\u00e6re med (literally, to be with you),\" explained Jacob, \" that I cannot resist it, Stirling.\" There was a considerable number of fir-trees at the foot of the Fjeld side that they were going to beat. Higher up the Fjeld birch, juniper, and heather grew with large quantities of Blaab\u00e6r (whortleberries). Here and there were small open places and wet spots. \" Lead that dog of yours with a long cord, Kristofer,\" said John Stirling. \" Once on scent, he will be off like a wolf, and we shall not see him a gain for a week. We shall beat the line on the Fjeld side, where the birch grows thin, Tyssen ; Kristofer will go between us ; keep about thirty yards from him, and in line with us. If either of the men run forward when the Dal Ryper rise, wait until they come back in line ; as we shall find several 11 *"], [176, "164 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. flocks of birds not far from each other, and the men will put up every bird out of shot by running on and shout ing. After that, we may beat ten miles of country and not see a feather.\" A considerable tract was beaten before any Ryper were found. The day opened fine and bright and they were higher up in the thinner cover on the Fjeld. At last there was the welcome sound of \" Ka-ak, kak-kek,\" and an old cock Dal Rype fell to Harild Tyssen's gun. \" Well shot, Tyssen ; but close up, as there are more near,\" said John Stirling. Several Ryper were now shot, and more would have been added to the bag if Jacob Oppedal could have been kept quiet. When a Rype rose he exclaimed in a mournful tone, \" He is flying away ! \" but when it fell to John Stirling's gun he clapped his hands, as if ap plauding in a circus, and shouted, \" Ja, j a, j a, ja!\" This did not tend to make the birds lie well. When they had beat the terrain, where they had found the Ryper, Stirling halted. \"It is no use our going on in this direction,\" he said ; \" we had better beat back to the S\u00e6ter, taking a line lower down, and try where the birch and fir mingle. We may get a blackcock, a grayhen, or a woodcock. We have also as many Dal Ryper as we and our people can consume.\""], [177, "165 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" They are a different bird in habits and flight to the Fjeld Rype, and larger,\" said Tyssen. \" And different when in the iron pot,\" added Stirling. \" The birds are now at their best, as the berries are abundant and ripe.\" As they were beating in line Jacob Oppedal was much excited at the sight of a grayhen. The bird rose, flew a short way, and repeatedly pitched close to. \" Don't shoot her, Tyssen,\" shouted Stirling. \" She has a little brood, or she would not keep rising and alighting so close to us. We shall find an old cock presently, and we will knock him over.\" \"What is that?\" asked Tyssen, as John Stirling fired quickly. \" It is a woodcock,\" he replied ; \" but Jacob Oppedal will not pick it up.\" A blackcock rose, and Harild Tyssen fired both his barrels at it without making any impression on it. \" They like it more forward,\" said John Stirling, shooting in his quick way and knocking the tough old cock over. \" This old fellow will want four hours of the iron pot ; he is as old as Methuselah.\" \" I cannot say, Stirling,\" said Harild Tyssen as they reached Lavdal S\u00e6ter, \" that I feel excessive regret that Jacob Oppedal disobeyed your orders this morning. Milk and a ship's biscuit are all very well, but a few Ryper"], [178, "166 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. with it is better. I wish, however, he had brought the spoons and plates, and had not entirely forgotten the pepper and salt.\" \" We can get a little of the rough salt they give the cattle at the S\u00e6ter,\" said Stirling. \" Jacob Oppedal's brains are small. One thought fills them.\" \" There must be few woodcock in Norway,\" said Tyssen ; \" as all the day we have only seen one.\" \" Barth, in his book on Norges Fuglevildt, or Game- Birds of Norway,\" said John Stirling, \" makes out an esti mate that there are 150,000 in Norway ; but this appears a very wide guess, as it is based on the acreage of the woods and forests in Norway.\" \" Is the Norse name Rugde, for woodcock, from ruge, to hatch ? \" asked Tyssen. \" That I cannot say,\" replied Stirling ; \" I have heard that it is so called from the way the ' r ' is pronounced in Norse, resembling the sound made by the bird ; but this, I think, must be wide of the mark. The only sounds I ever hear from woodcocks are two ; one like ' knort, knort,' followed by a sound like ' peest.' I only speak from my own observation ; but a certain Herr Hoffman von Thungen is quite certain that the cocks make the sound of ' knort, knort,' and the hens ' peest.' The names given to the woodcock are many. I have heard them called Blomfugle at Vange. Blom is what the Bander call the smaller varieties of ferns. At other"], [179, "167 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. places I have heard them called Myrsneppe, or moor snipe, Natterugde from its nocturnal habits, Holtsneppe or forest-snipe, Knorteknispe, after the sound they make, and in Finland the Lavskovskryte, or the leafy wood's jackass.\" \" There are plenty of woodcock in America,\" remarked Tyssen. \" The naturalists call your woodcock scolopax minor ; this,\" said Stirling, taking the woodcock he had shot out of his pocket, \" is scolopax rusticola. I was obliged to pick this bird up, as Jacob Oppedal would not touch it. He says it is a Troldfugl, and is a sign of bad luck, and especially liable to cause epilepsy. In the south of Nor way this notion has died out ; but only a few years since the Bander, who snared woodcock, cut their bills off before sending them to market, that they should look as respectable as other birds. A long nose is not considered beautiful in Scandinavia. I shall have to roast this wood cock on a stick ; for if we put it in the iron pot with the Ryper, Jacob Oppedal will not touch its contents and will regard that particular iron pot as unclean.\" \"Where are woodcock most plentiful in Norway?\" asked Tyssen. \"In the south and middle. They are also plentiful in the corresponding parts of Russia and Siberia ; but are seldom found higher than 64\u00b0 of latitude. The higher north, the fewer woodcock. They begin to get restless"], [180, "168 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. and shift towards the coast the latter end of August and September, and migrate chiefly to the shores of the Mediterranean. They are of solitary habits, and I have never, myself, seen more than two woodcocks in any one day in Norway, and that when beating favourable ground for them. They return to Norway in April, but the time varies according to the spring of the year being mild or the reverse. Barth has a whim that in some years the woodcock has two broods ; their eggs are certainly found early in May and late in July. There is a method of killing woodcock practised in Norway and Sweden, and that is by shooting them as they tr\u00e6k, or fly from place to place in the woods ; when so doing they often fly in small circles. The woodcock begins to tr\u00e6k at fifteen to twenty minutes after sundown, in still, clear weather. This plan is much to be condemned, as it is chiefly at the end of April or in May, during the nesting season, that it is practised. I have heard it defended by the assertion that only cock birds are so killed. The Ger mans appear to praise this manner of shooting, for I have read the following somewhere. Aus den Schnepfenstrich ein gliiekliger Schuss Das ist der Waldmann's schbnster Genuss. If it be a sportsman's greatest delight, it is a poor way of being happy \u2014 at any rate, for the woodcocks.\" \" Well,\" said Tyssen, \" I did think I knew all about"], [181, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 169 woodcock from your English books. Thank you for telling me so much that is fresh to me.\" \" The fact is, Tyssen, our knowledge is never complete in any subject,\" said John Stirling. \" It is the old analogy that knowledge is like the sand on the sea shore ; do what we will, we only collect a handful.\" The next day they returned to the tent, and from it made several excursions ; but heard of and saw no trace of reindeer. After being ten days absent from Nordal a messenger came with letters which excited in both Tyssen and Stirling a special interest. \" I have heard from my father in New York, Stirling,\" said Harild Tyssen ; \" he writes with warm gratitude to you for your kindness to me at Vange, six weeks ago. There is also a letter from the Amtmand, to ask if they can send up anything to us that we would like, and with many friendly greetings to you from himself and Fru Nordal. There is a letter, too, from one of the Nordal girls, who says your sister is perfectly well.\" John Stirling's letters were : \u2014 \" Dear Herr Stirling, \" Your sister is well, and as we daily understand her better we get to know how nice she really is. We think you resemble each other in many things. She is like you, quick to decide, and never hesitates, while there cannot be a kinder heart. My father says she is one of those women whose mere presence brings a wealth of"], [182, "170 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. happiness ; and I think so too, for our house has become so bright. The Provst says she is delightful, and Agathe Simonson regards her with fear lest she should attract Kapellan Hansen. Many of our acquaintances have called to see the English lady, and your sister has visited many families, all of whom speak kindly of her. So you will see she is among friends, and that you are not trusting her to me only, but to us all. We hope you are getting good sport in the Fjelds, and we all send our united greetings. \" Yours, \" Emilie Nordal.\" \" Mt dear John, \" You shall not be kept a moment in suspense ; she has given you all her heart long since. You can yourself read it between the lines of her letter. It is in Norse, and I asked her to tell me its substance. She demurred, as it was about myself, but she at last read it to me in English. She says you resemble me, conse quently she has you in her mind. But now comes proof positive. I thanked her for her kind expressions about me, and said, ' But what do you think about John ? ' She saw I knew her secret, and in an agony of fright and fear begged me not to disclose it to you. ' It will be as if I offered myself to him,' she said, and she sank to the ground in shame and fear ; and she cried so that"], [183, "171 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. I feared I should not be able to write you what you so much want to hear. At last I showed her your letter addressed to me in England, in which you spoke of her in such warm praise and said you intended to marry her if she would have you, and asked me to come to you in Norway. I may have been wrong, but I could not bear to see her in such distress. Her face grew so bright that it was like an angel's ; you have won her, dear John, and she is worth a kingdom. \" Now for the news : She refused a man called Karl Tobiesen, who has since proposed to Olava Nordal, and has been refused by her also. He has since been perse cuting me with attentions, but I have told the Amtmand of my engagement to Colonel Veryan, and that I am going to be married to him on his return from India. He is now in pursuit of Sophie Nordal. Nothing can exceed their thoughtful kindness to me, and I shall be rejoiced to show them all that we can be kind too. They are people I respect and love. Do not come here before the time you fixed upon before you left. God bless you, John. ' Fanny. \" P.S. \u2014 Send back some game, she would like you to do so.\" \" What does your sister say, Stirling? \" asked Tyssen. \" Send back some game,\" replied John Stirling."], [184, "172 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"I do not understand why such a message should excite such deep interest,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" She wishes it,\" said John Stirling ; but he did not say to whom the pronoun referred. \"Kristofer,\" he shouted, \" how many Ryper have we ? \" \" Halvandet Par (a brace and a half),\" replied Kris tofer. \" But we can get more by shooting up towards the higher Fjelds ; we have not been there yet, for fear of disturbing the deer.\" \" Call me at two, Jacob,\" said John Stirling ; \" tell the messenger he must wait until we come back with some game. He has got a horse, and can take all we are likely to shoot.\""], [185, "173 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. CHAPTER XV. Where lies her charm ? is it her voice, Clear as a silver bell, Or her grace of manner, winning more Than I can think or tell ? Where lies her charm ? is it her hair, Or eyes of wondrous blue, Or her hand's soft touch, imparting That she is tender too ? \"My goodness, Stirling,\" said Tyssen, the next day, as they left to go shooting, \" you are walking like an American trotter.\" \" I intend to shoot some Ryper to-day to send back to Nordal,\" said John Stirling. \" It is five English miles to the ground, and if we do not get the messenger off early he will stick at Opheim all night ; and I wish him to arrive as soon as possible at Nordal.\" When they reached the terrain they were going to beat, a few Fjeld Ryper rose. John Stirling behaved very differently to Harild Tyssen's previous experience. He"], [186, "174 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. strode through the dwarf willows and birch, and cut down every bird he fired at right and left. Hitherto he had not fired at a bird that Harild Tyssen had a chance of shooting ; but this morning John Stirling was no respecter of the courtesies of sport. Tyssen had scarcely a shot ; and more than once, when he did fire, the bird he had aimed at was already shot. Jacob Oppedal attempted his usual eccentricities, but was checked by a hard word and a still harder fist. \" Kristofer ! \" roared John Stirling, \" there are three birds down you have not picked up ; look alive, man, or I will twist your head off, and your dog's too.\" \" Why, Stirling,\" said Tyssen, \" what is the matter ? \" \"I told you I wanted to shoot some game to send back to Nordal, and I cannot get these two fools even to pick the birds up.\" \" You have shot at least a dozen,\" said Tyssen, \" cutting them down before they were a yard off the ground.\" \" What 's a dozen ? Have you got those birds, Kristo fer ! \" he roared out. \" Jo, det har jeg, (Yes, I have),\" said Kristofer, shaking in his shoes. \" Then come on, and do not be so infernally slow,\" shouted John Stirling, striding on at a great pace. There was no fear of Jacob Oppedal's running ahead now. \" Do put your gun in now and then, Tyssen,\" said John"], [187, "175 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Stirling, sharply. \" I see bird after bird going away, and you do not fire.\" \" Shoot ! \" said Tyssen. \" I have not time to breathe. You have always advised going slowly before to-day, but as soon as I can see a bird it is shot.\" \" What nonsense, Tyssen. I have seen at least three birds go away that you might have shot at. Drive on, Kristofer ! \" he yelled. And on went John Stirling, through the scrub and over rocks, shooting with a quickness and certainty un usual even for him. When they got to the end of the terrain that held the Ryper, he halted. \" How many, Kristofer ? \" he asked. \" Forty-two,\" said Kristofer, counting them out on a rock ; \" but this noise will disturb the deer, and they will smell the powder for a week.\" \" Let us go back to the tent,\" said John Stirling. \"I have important letters to write to send by the messenger.\" And he walked back at a great pace. John Stirling's letters were : \u2014 \" Bless you, Fanny mine, and thank you. You can tell her she is very dear to me, but that I would rather come and say so than write it.\" To Emilie Nordal he wrote, in Norse : \u2014 \" Thank you a thousand times. I will come and speak what my heart has longed to say. Thank you, thank you.\""], [188, "176 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. When the messenger arrived at Nordal, he delivered the Ryper, counting them out on the door-steps. \" But is there no letter ? \" asked the Amtmand. \"No; but there is a little case for Herr Stirling's sister.\" Fanny Stirling gave the man ten Kroner, snatched the case out of the man's hand, and, followed by Emilie, went up to the bedroom they occupied in common. \" It is like John,\" said Fanny Stirling, as she read his note. \" A word from him means more than long letters from other men. Has he written you more, Emilie ? \" \" A few words, but beautifully chosen,\" she replied ; \" they mean a life of happiness to me. I like him so ! I like him so ! \" \" He will be here soon,\" said Fanny Stirling ; \" and if you say Yes, say it without reserve.\" \" I will give him my life,\" she said, earnestly. A week after, Kristofer appeared at Nordal with a note from Harild Tyssen to the Amtmand, who saw at once that something unusual had happened. \" Kom med det (out with it),\" said the Amtmand, sharply. \" Herr Stirling has had a bad fall on the Fjeld and is badly hurt,\" replied Kristofer. The Amtmand tore open the cover in which Harild Tyssen had wrapped his note. It was short, and said that Stirling had had a fall on a glacier on the Fjelds ; that he"], [189, "177 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. had lain where he fell some hours before they found him ; and that the long time occupied in fetching a camp-bed from the tent and carrying him down from the Fjelds had caused so much pain and exhaustion that it was not possible to say how it would go with him. A doctor should be sent at once. Fanny Stirling turned pale for a moment, and there was a look of bitter anxiety in her face. \" I shall go to my brother, Herr Amtmand, at once,\" she said. \"But, little Ven,\" said the Amtmand, \"it is twenty eight miles to Opheim, and twenty-two more to the S\u00e6ter, and over the roughest mountain-paths.\" \" I shall go, whatever the distance is,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" But, mit Barn (my child), what use can you be to your brother ? \" urged the Amtmand. \" Nurse him and watch by him night and day,\" she said. \" There are great discomforts to a lady at a S\u00e6ter or in a tent,\" he said. \" I should go, Herr Amtmand, if I knew it were to certain death,\" said Fanny Stirling, in a tone of quiet resolution. Fru Nordal went to her, and kissed her on the cheek. \"You shall go, Fanny,\" she said, \" and Emilie shall go with you. We could not allow you to be on the Fjelds 12"], [190, "178 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. without a female friend, and, also, you are ignorant of our language.\" The Amtmand sent for horses, or rather ponies, on one of which was loaded bedding and provisions. Fanny Stirling and Emily Nordal each rode a pony, and Kristofer led the one with the baggage. Before they left, Fanny Stirling brought the Amtmand fifty pounds in English money. \" There will be the doctor to be paid and the expenses of the horses,\" she explained. \" I will take care of the fifty pounds until you return, little Fanny,\" said the Amtmand ; \" do not trouble your pretty head about such things now.\" They stopped the night at Opheim, although Fanny Stirling would have gone on. They left early the next day, and when on a high ridge of the Fjeld, Kristofer stopped. \" L\u00e6gen, nu kommer han ! \" he said. \" He sees the doctor coming back,\" said Emilie. \" It is a good sign that he returns so quickly.\" The doctor got off his horse, and bowed low to the ladies. In reply to their eager questions, he said, \" There is nothing to fear, Fraken Emilie, unless inflammation sets in. He is badly bruised all over, but I cannot see there is other injury. It will be a fortnight at least before he can leave the S\u00e6ter. He is in a camp-bed by the fire in the S\u00e6ter-hut, and Herr Tyssen and Jacob"], [191, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 179 Oppedal are with him. As both arms are sprained, he appears to have rolled down an incline on a glacier, and he can do nothing for himself. This very likely happened when he first lost his foothold, as he would naturally in falling throw his arms out to protect his head.\" \"Is there anything in particular to be attended to, Herr Nilson ? \" asked Emilie Nordal. \" What he wants is attention, rest, and quiet,\" replied the doctor. \" Thank you very much, Herr Nilson. We expected the very worst,\" said Emilie Nordal. \" Ask him what his fee is, Emilie,\" said Fanny Stir ling. \" It is quite four days' journey from Nordby and back, and then he has had to hire horses.\" \"Sixty Kroner,\" replied the doctor; \" but Herr Tyssen has given me a hundred.\" \" Miss Stirling desires me to say she is very much obliged to you for your attention to her brother, Herr Nilson,\" said Emilie Nordal. \" Now my heart is light,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" I heard you crying last night, and your face is not bright now.\" \" The doctor says he is badly hurt, and inflammation may set in,\" said Emilie Nordal. \" A strong man like John will soon recover from a few bruises. I have seen him twice brought home on a hurdle after bad accidents with the horses he breeds at St. Boss, 12 *"], [192, "180 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. and after a few days I have seen him riding another colt.\" Kristofer pointed out the S\u00e6ter-hut and the tent. \" Herr Tyssen,\" he said, \" has paid the S\u00e6ter- folk to take their cattle elsewhere, and has had the place cleaned outside and in, and the tent shifted close to the S\u00e6ter hut.\" They had been observed from the S\u00e6ter, and Harild Tyssen met them. \" You will find your brother, Miss Stirling, a good deal knocked about,\" he said ; \" but he is doing well.\" \" Thank you, Herr Tyssen, for your attention to him,\" she said. \" I shall never forget it.\" Fanny Stirling stepped into the S\u00e6ter, and her brother at once recognised her quick footfall. \"Dear John,\" she said, as she kissed his pale face, \" I have come to nurse you.\" \" Bless you, Fanny mine,\" he said ; \" but who is with you. \" She has come, John,\" whispered Fanny ; \" I told her to wait outside until I had seen you. Tell Jacob Oppedal to go out.\" Jacob Oppedal had been sitting for hours by John Stirling, holding a cup of milk in case he should want to drink, and watching the least sign of his eyes or mouth. \" Go outside a little while, Jacob,\" said Stirling. But Jacob Oppedal would not until the doctor's direc-"], [193, "181 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. tions had been explained, so that he could feel sure that attention to them would not for a moment be relaxed. Harild Tyssen was giving Emilie Nordal an account of John Stirling's accident, when Fanny Stirling beckoned to her. She was very pale. \" She is not well, Mr. Tyssen,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" Will you wait outside and keep Jacob Oppedal from coming in? Come, Emilie ; John can scarcely move hand or foot, but he is the same John to you and me.\" \" I hope you feel better, Herr Stirling,\" began Emilie Nordal. \" Yes, thank you,\" he replied. \" What nonsense for two people who understand each other to talk in that way,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" Why, John, she was crying about you all last night. I was awake from anxiety, and heard her. Take off your hat, Emilie, and sit down by him. I will go outside and talk to Mr. Tyssen.\" \" She has made my asking you to be my wife a form, Emilie,\" said John Stirling. \" Please bring your sweet face nearer to me, and say Yes.\" \" You have known that I should say Yes,\" she said, hiding her face behind his pillow. \" Kneel down by the camp-bed and put your face closer yet, and say, Yes, John.\" \" Yes, John,\" she replied ; \" I will give my life to you."], [194, "182 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" It is so sweet to hear you say so,\" he said ; \" you are a golden thing with a voice of silver, and I have loved you with all my heart a long, long time, but doubted if you cared for me.\" \"There is no doubt, John,\" she replied; \"but can I do anything for you ? \" \" Yes, I am thirsty,\" said John. \" Will you have some milk, or water, or some wine ? \" she asked. \" No,\" he said ; \" I thirst to kiss you.\" As she bent her face to his, Fanny Stirling entered. \"I shall put my seal to the contract too, John,\" she said, as she kissed Emilie. \" We are sisters now, and one in our love for John. But there must be no more talking now, John.\" Notwithstanding his entreaties, she insisted on Emilie Nordal's leaving him. When out of her brother's hear ing, she said, \" You can see him again this evening, but you must return to Nordal to-morrow with Jacob Oppedal and the horses. Mr. Tyssen will want Kristofer to go with him when he shoots.\" \" I dare not leave without my father's instructions,\" said Emilie Nordal. \" He would say it was wrong to leave you without a female friend or servant on these Fjelds, or to leave the man I have promised to marry in such suffering. He would say ' A word from you would comfort him.' \""], [195, "183 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" You are a Norwegian woman and I am English,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" I believe you would sacrifice every thing for those you love.\" \" My love would be poor indeed if I would not,\" replied Emilie Nordal. \" It is for those she loves a woman lives.\" \" You are the truest woman, Emilie,\" said Fanny Stir ling, kissing her with affection. \" I will tell John what you have said, and it will make him happy to hear it ; but he must be left now with Jacob Oppedal to watch him while we have something to eat, and I will watch by him at night.\" \" I shall write my father and ask him to come here,\" said Emilie Nordal ; \" he often takes long rides over the Fjelds.\" \" And what shall you write your father ? \" asked Fanny. \"Everything,\" she replied. \" I shall say that I feel it will be my happiness to give my life to John. This would be answering the first question he would ask me before he puts it. I shall tell him also that I know John has a strong attachment for me. My father's view is that there should be a sincere attachment on both sides.\" \" And so there should be, you true-hearted woman,\" said Fanny Stirling, caressing her, and thinking of a certain soldier in India."], [196, "184 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

The table in the S\u00e6ter hut had been made therein, and could not be got out of the doorway ; but two stools could, and his camp-bed with a waterproof sheet on it was spread with the provisions they had brought with them from Nordal ; and the iron pot, with some boiled reindeer-meat"], [197, "185 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. and Ryper, was on the tent-floor, if the grass turf of the Fjeld could be called so. \" Stirling,\" explained Harild Tyssen, \"would not allow a single article to be sent to the Fjelds that was not necessary. There are consequently two tablespoons, two iron soup-plates, the salt is in its original jar, and the pepper in its native tin. For knives we use our T\u00e6lle knive, but I have an ivory -handled one that I bought in Trondhjem that you can share between you ; and for tumblers and tea-cups we use the cups of our pocket flasks. Last but not least, is that iron pot, for which I have acquired the sincerest affection.\" \" But we have spoons and knives and forks sent up from Nordal,\" said Fraken Emilie ; \" they are wrapped up in two serviettes. There are also plates and tumblers in the right-hand saddle-bag.\" \" What a godsend ! \" exclaimed Harild Tyssen, with mock fervour. \" I had cut our only clean towel in half to produce two serviettes, and even that was unnecessary. We have plenty of milk, in the wooden tub, that they bring in from a S\u00e6ter fourteen English miles' distant. They will take this away empty to-morrow and replace it with another full of milk. Water we have in empty bottles fresh from a spring that the S\u00e6ter people indi cated to us before they left.\" \" We shall not starve on these barren Fjelds, Mr. Tyssen,\" said Fanny Stirling; \"but as I want to relieve"], [198, "186 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Jacob Oppedal from watching bv John, will you kindly let me have anything I may have at once.' \" Allow me to assist you with my advice and experi ence,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" First, you sit on this stool on which I have put a blanket, so that your feet can rest on it, and then you take your table-spoon, and ladle out of the iron pot a plate of soup. V\u00e6rsgo (a con traction of V\u00e6r saa god, ' be so good '),\" he added, as he handed her a plate of soup, and afterwards another to Fraken Emilie. \" It is excellent,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" Indeed it is,\" said Fraken Emilie. \" Kristofer,\" he shouted, \" turn out the saddle-bags and be ready with the plates, knives, and forks by the time the soup is finished ; but get the tumblers first.\" \" Claret, Miss Stirling, with a little water ? Now, having the appreciable advantage of a fork and a clean plate, here is some reindeer venison and some Ryper. Utrum horum mavis accipe, but my advice is, try both. I shot the deer the day Stirling met with his accident.\" \" But you are eating nothing, Herr Tyssen,\" said Fraken Emilie. \" I shall have my dinner later with a friend I have made,\" said Tyssen ; \" his name is Barfod ; and then Kristofer and Jacob will have a chance of getting some thing, and Barfod will also be in attendance. There is some good S\u00e6ter cheese, a pot of marmalade, some of the"], [199, "187 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Nordal bread and butter, and a bunch of the finest raisins.\" \" Please tell us about John's accident, Mr. Tyssen, as you are eating nothing now,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" The weather for ten days after our coming here,\" replied Tyssen, \" was steady. The wind then shifted to the west-north-west and west, and dodged round to the southward, and we had heavy rain, gales of wind, and occasional snow. We had repeatedly to take shelter in the S\u00e6ter hut, and it was getting to be very dull. At last the wind moderated, and it became warmer, with a soft rain. When the weather was at all clear, Kristofer made expeditions to the higher Fjelds, and one day came in with the news of some reindeer having passed a high point on the glacier north of this. He had seen the track of the deer in the snow, but he was uncertain which of the valleys the deer had entered. He brought in a bit of wild ranunculus, which he called Renblommen. Stirling said it was the Ranunculus glacialis : a reindeer had bitten it, and the bite was fresh. It was then three in the afternoon : we had just begun dinner. Stirling and I smoked a pipe and turned in early, and left the tent at one the next morning. As the wind was southerly, we took a wide course to the westward. It is necessary to explain this, as it will make what follows clearer to you. We then reached a third Dal or valley, and went in a northerly direction to the glacier, which we reached about"], [200, "188 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. nine in the morning. We then halted, ate some food we had brought with us, and discussed our future move ments. Stirling had a strong opinion that the reindeer had gone down the more easterly valley, and insisted that I should go down it with Kristofer and his dog Barfod. He and Jacob Oppedal went down the other valley. Vegetation almost entirely ceases on the higher Fjelds ; and the scene is nothing but barren rocks where the snow does not cover them, and deep ravines caused by the rushing down of the snow-rivers. The walking is rough in the extreme, climbing would better express it ; and it was over such a terrain we had subsequently to carry Stirling. We had left him about two hours, when Kris tofer stopped and lay down. I at once did the same. ' Look at Barfod,' he said. The dog held his nose in the air, and evidently winded something. I held the dog whilst Kristofer took my binocular and looked carefully in every direction. At last I saw he had caught sight of the deer. ' There are seven deer,' he said, ' and one buck ; he is on a rock with his nose up to the south wind.' We then stalked, and I shot the buck. The skin, horns, and haunches we took with us, and buried the rest. We crossed over the Fjeld to find Stirling. We expected he would go more quickly than we did from his great activity, also we had been delayed, stalking and cutting up the deer. We were, therefore, not surprised to see nothing of him ; but Kristofer was uneasy. He could"], [201, "189 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. see from the ridge of the high Fjeld on which we were down the valley for many miles, and he examined with the binocular every hole and corner. At length we made out Jacob Oppedal going hither and thither in a purpose less manner. ' Stirling has met with an accident,' said Kristofer, when Jacob Oppedal came up to us : he was in a breathless state of excitement. Stirling had told him to go to a height on the Fjeld and look out for deer When he came back Stirling was gone. ' He has fallen through the snow at the lower end of the glacier,' said Kristofer ; aud, after a long search, there we found him. He had slipped on a snow incline, rolled to the bottom, and fallen through a bridge of snow. The hard rocks underneath severely bruised and the icy-cold water from the glacier chilled him. We took off his wet clothes and put our dry clothes on him ; and Kristofer gave him some Aquavit he had with him. Jacob Oppedal's grief was indescribable. It was some time before I could get him to understand that he and Kristofer must fetch a camp bed from the tent, and, if possible, bring another man with them to carry Stirling down to the S\u00e6ter. They brought the camp-bed and the woman at the S\u00e6ter, and she was most useful ; but several hours elapsed, during which I did my best to keep Stirling warm. He was scarcely conscious. Our difficult journey down the Fjeld can be more imagined than described. Stirling's rifle was found at a great height above where we found him. His"], [202, "190 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. life was probably saved by the resistance of the snow bridge, through which he fell, checking Jhis fall. When we came to the S\u00e6ter, I had the kettle, in which they make the cheese, filled with water, so as to give him a warm bath.\" \" Thank you, Mr. Tyssen,\" said Fanny Stirling, with much warmth ; \" I shall never forget your care and thoughtfulness to John. You must come and see us at St. Boss.\" \" Your brother, Miss Stirling,\" said Tyssen, \" was deli rious after he reached the S\u00e6ter. He had something, he said, to say at Nordal. This appeared to distress him.\" \" I do not think that will distress him very much,\" said Fanny Stirling ; \" but we must go now, Mr. Tyssen. Emilie has a letter to write to her father, which she can do in the inner room of the S\u00e6ter hut where she is going to sleep. Jacob Oppedal has to take the horses back, and he will also take her letter. He starts for Opheim to night, and goes to Nordal to-morrow. I shall watch all night by John, and we cannot see you any more to-day. Thank you very much.\" When they entered the S\u00e6ter hut, Fanny Stirling asked Emilie Nordal to interpret what she wished to say to Jacob Oppedal. \" There is a hundred Kroner note for your solicitude for my brother,\" she said. \" You will have to go to"], [203, "191 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Nordal as quick as possible with the horses and take a letter to the Amtmand.\" \" Dad og Pine,\" said Jacob, \" I would go to Nord Kap for Stirling's sister. A hundred Kroner from her! no; not a Skilling (an old coin of small value).\" \"Do come here, Fanny,\" said Stirling from his camp bed. \" Where is she ? \" \" She is here, John, but she wishes to write to Nor dal,\" replied his sister, bending her face to his. \" After she has written she will feel more at ease, and we will both of us come and sit by you.\" \" Thank you, Fanny mine,\" he said. Emilie Nordal's letter to her father was in almost the same and in as few words as she had mentioned to Fanny Stirling that she should write. She also asked him to come to the Fjelds, if he possibly could, and arrange how John Stirling could be conveyed down to Opheim, whence the journey to Nordal would be comparatively easy. \" Here we are, John,\" said his sister ; \" but we shall leave you if you talk too much. Sit by his pillow, Emilie, and stop him if he does. Tell him about Mr. Tyssen paying the doctor and clearing out the S\u00e6ter hut for him, and his thoughtful kindness after his accident.\" \" Tell me, sweetheart,\" he said. She told him in Norse at some length."], [204, "192 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Her voice is like a silver bell, Fanny,\" he said. \"That is too long a speech, John,\" said his sister; \" and, moreover, it should have been addressed to her.\" \" But you do not know how sweet it is to hear her, Fanny,\" he said. \" That also,\" said his sister, \" should have been said to her ; and, moreover, it is a longer speech.\" \" She is so far off, Fanny,\" he said. \" Why, you unreasonable man, she is sitting at your pillow, and I am at tbe foot of your camp-bed.\" \" May I ask him how he feels now ? \" whispered Emilie Nordal. \" I can hear by the tone of his voice that he is no better,\" said Fanny, in a low voice ; \" he is suffering acute pain yet. I see it by the drawn look of his mouth, and the weariness of his eyes, which only brighten when you speak.\" \" Do you think he could sleep ?\" she asked. \" He will get into a dozy state as the constant pain wearies him,\" replied Fanny Stirling. \"I think you had best say Good-night to him. Speak a kind word and go.\" \" Good-night ! John,\" said Emilie, bending over him and kissing him on the forehead. \" I will not leave you while you are suffering so much.\" \" Thank you, sweetheart,\" said John Stirling, faintly. Fanny Stirling had gone through a course of training as hospital nurse, as every woman who intends to be a"], [205, "193 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. soldier's wife should. She took off his bandages and ap plied fresh lint where the skin had been abraded or cut. She recollected her brother had a little medicine-case, and that he always had a little laudanum in it. This case would be in the tent. She opened the door of the inner room of the S\u00e6ter hut and called softly to Emilie. \" I am watching, too,\" she said ; \" to be ready at any moment.\" Fanny Stirling explained what she wanted to do, and told her meanwhile to keep the door a little open to hear if her brother should ask for anything. \" Fanny,\" said Stirling, from his camp-bed. \" What is it, John ? \" asked Emilie, coming close to him. \" Fanny has gone to fetch the medicine-case, to give you a sleeping draught.\" \" Say something to me, sweetheart,\" said John. \" Do let me do something for you to-morrow, or any time,\" she said. \" It will be such a pleasure for me to do anything for you.\" \" Bless you, sweetheart,\" he said. 13"], [206, "194 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. CHAPTER XVII. Say, why is her voice so thrilling ? From whence its magic spell ? I listen, and listen, and love Beyond what I can tell. Jaded with her long watch by her brother's camp-bed, Fanny Stirling went out of the S\u00e6ter hut at three the next morning, to breathe the fresh air of the Fjelds. Harild Tyssen was sitting by the side of the iron pot, which he had described as having become so dear to him. \" You are paying early attention to the object of your affections, Mr. Tyssen,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" How is Stirling ? \" he asked. \"He is asleep, and has slept for four hours,\" she replied. \" Stirling has a great notion about reindeer-broth. He says that the deer feed on a moss which is nearly all starch, and that reindeer venison is the most nitrogenous of all foods. I am, therefore, brewing the broth. Kristofer"], [207, "195 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. lit the fire, but if left to himself he is apt to fall asleep ; and the fire should be kept up, so as to boil the venison slowly, so Stirling says. This is my first cooking experience, and I follow his instructions.\" \"It is quite right,\" said Fanny Stirling; \"and it is kind and good of you, Mr. Tyssen. You must come and see us in England, that we may show you that we can be kind also. I must go back to John now. Thank you very much.\" \" She is like Stirling, only she is a woman,\" said Harild Tyssen to himself. \" That officer in India is a lucky fellow. She has not slept a wink, and that after her fatiguing journey up the Fjelds ; and she has gone now to watch by her brother for hours more.\" John Stirling woke up, after six hours' sleep, much better. The stiffness was less rigid, his eyes had lost much of the weary look that so much pain had pro duced. \" I am better, Fanny mine,\" he said. \" Can you give me a cup of tea ? \" \"How are your arms, John ? \" she asked as she gave him some tea in the cup of his pocket-flask. He could lift them, but could not hold the drinking-cup which she put to his lips. \" Last night your arms smelt of some thing I did not know. What was it, Jobn ? \" \" Jacob Oppedal said a charm over some Br\u00e6ndevin and rubbed it into my arms,\" he replied. \" He warmed 13 *"], [208, "196 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. it by the fire, and as it evaporated from the skin it had a cooling effect, and my arms do not feel so stiff now.\" The door of the inner room of the S\u00e6ter hut gently opened. \"May I come in, Fanny?\" asked Emilie Nordal; \"I heard your voices, and I want to know how he is so much.\" \" Come in, by all means,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" John is better, and the danger of inflammation is passed.\" \" I am so thankful,\" she said earnestly, with a bright look. \" Are you not going to speak to me ? \" asked John Stirling. \" I will not only speak to you, but do anything for you, John,\" she said. \" She has been up and waiting the whole night through, John, in hopes that she might do anything for you. She needs rest,\" said Fanny Stirling ; \" tell her to lie down and go to sleep.\" \" Do, please, sweetheart mine,\" said John. \" And go with her, Fanny, and sleep too. I shall be more at ease if you do.\" In the evening of that day Harild Tyssen was invited into the S\u00e6ter hut to see Stirling. \"He will not feel so well towards night,\" said Fanny Stirling, \" so do not stay long, Mr. Tyssen.\" \" How many Ryper to-day, Tyssen ? \" asked Stirling."], [209, "197 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Only five ; but we have plenty of reindeer meat yet, and I was only out a short time,\" replied Tyssen. \" Tell us about Jacob Oppedal charming you, John,\" said his sister. \" He warmed some Br\u00e6ndevin by the fire,\" he replied, \" and with many crossings and gesticulations repeated a rough rhyme over it ; but in so low a tone that I could not hear what it was. He then rubbed the Br\u00e6n devin on the swollen places on my arms.\" \" I know the first verse of the formula,\" said Emilie ; \" it is : \u2014 Jeg red mig en Gang gjennem et Led Saa fik min sorte Fole Vred Saa satte jeg Kj0d mod Kjad og Blod mod Blod Saa blev min sorte Fole god. One time did I ride through a gate, And my black foal got a sprain, So I put flesh against flesh, and blood against blood, So my black foal came well again. We do not say of this that it is to charm, but to signe, or bless, in the sense of exorcising. It is usually practised by old women, who are called Signekj\u00e6rringer. It is, however, only particular families who are said to have any power of healing by this process. It is possible that Jacob Oppedal belongs to such a family.\" \" Gypsies have similar practices in England,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" Are there any in Norway ? \" \"Yes,\" replied Emilie Nordal; \"we call them Tater-"], [210, "198 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. folk. They also pretend, by pouring molten lead into water in some hocus-pocus fashion, to foretell events, or cure sickness, or find out how cattle are bewitched. They chant a formula, some of which I can repeat : \u2014 Jeg maner i Veir, og jeg maner i Vind, Jeg maner den ud, og jeg maner den ind Jeg maner i Syd, og jeg maner i 0st, Jeg maner i Nord, og jeg maner i Vest ; Jeg maner i Jord, og jeg maner i Vand, Jeg maner i Bjerg, og jeg maner i Sand. This is what we call a ' Tatervise og gypsy chant,' and it means that they exorcise in weather and wind, out or in, in the south or in the east, in the north or in the west, in the earth or in the water, in the rock or the sand. There is, of course, much more extemporised to suit the occasion. The shape the lead takes when it cools in the water is supposed to indicate the desired answer. But no answer can be given until arvet Solv, that is some silver coin or article that has been inherited, has been placed in the gypsy's hand.\" \" How well she has got to speak English,\" said John Stirling ; \" it is so nice to hear her.\" \" Now, John,\" said his sister, \" if you do not keep quiet I shall send her and Mr. Tyssen away.\" \" The dragon that guards her treasure keeps careful watch,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" Do let her tell us a story in Norse, Fanny,\" said John Stirling, like a child begging for a fairy-story."], [211, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 199 \"Do please, Fraken Nordal,\" said Tyssen. \"I will act as Tolk to Miss Stirling.\" \" There are so many,\" said Emilie Nordal. \" There is the story of the Kulbr\u00e6nderen, or charcoal-burner.\" \" Anything will do, Emilie,\" said Fanny Stirling, \" so long as we keep him interested and quiet.\" \" There was once,\" related Emilie, \" a charcoal-burner ; and he died leaving a son who was also a charcoal- burner. After his father died the son married, but was so lazy and good-for-nothing that scarcely anyone would employ him as charcoal-burner. One day he went with a load of charcoal to sell in a town, and at the time there happened to be a meeting of the priests of the district. The charcoal-burner was struck with the respect everyone paid them. 'I should like to be a priest,' said the charcoal-burner to a by-stander. ' You are black enough to be one,' said the man ; ' and I will tell you how you can become a priest very easily. A priest has just died, and his widow is selling his things by auction. You can buy the priest's gown and ruff and put them on, and then you will be a priest as good as some of them.' The charcoal-burner followed the advice given him, and also got tipsy and spent all the money he had received for the charcoal, and when he arrived home he had not a farthing in his pocket, but he had the priest's gown and ruff. ' We shall live bravely now that I am a priest,' he said to his wife. ' Yes,' she"], [212, "200 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. replied ; ' I know that strong ale is often followed by big words.' One day he saw many priests going to the King's house, so he put on his gown and ruff and went too. The King told the assembled priests that he had lost his signet-ring, and had called them together to advise him as to; its recovery. If any one of them assisted him in this who was not yet called to be priest, he should have a call. H he were already a priest, he should be a Provst. If Provst, a Bishop. ' I am the wise priest and true prophet,' said the charcoal-burner, possibly a little drunk. ' Then,' said the King, ' find the ring.' ' It is not every year that the salmon lays its eggs in the tops of the fir-trees,' said the charcoal-burner ; ' I must have time and plenty of paper to make my calcu lations upon, for what is done in the dark is difficult to bring to light.' They soon found that the priest whom nobody knew could do more than say his Fader vor, (Lord's prayer), for he used up masses of paper with writing that looked like fish-hooks and crowsfeet ; but time went on, and the King said he must find the ring in three days, or lose his life. Now it so happened that the three house-karls who had charge of the charcoal burner had stolen the ring. When one of them came to bring the charcoal-burner his supper at the close of the first of the three days, he said, with a sigh, 'That is the first.' The house-karl was frightened, and told the other two. The same thing happened on the second and"], [213, "201 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. third days. The three house-karls came and fell on their knees and besought the supposed priest not to betray them. ' Bring the ring,' he said, ' and some thick porridge.' He then told them to give it to the King's boar, who speedily swallowed the porridge and the ring. ' No human being has the ring,' said the charcoal-burner ; ' it is the King's boar.' The boar was slaughtered and the ring found. The King was pleased. He directed that the strange priest should have a call \u2014 that is, be appointed to a parish, and other gifts. The new priest's first duty was to read his letter of call to his congrega tion ; but naturally he should first have breakfast. He made a mistake, and instead of dipping a piece of flad brad into the milk he dipped the parchment letter, and as it was tough to chew he gave it to his dog, who at once swallowed it. When he came to church the congrega tion expected to hear the royal letter read ; but the char coal-burner went at once into the pulpit and said: 'What you should have heard, my friends, is gone to the dogs ; and with this my discourse is ended. Come again next Sunday, and you shall hear more.' The congregation thought he might improve with time. The next Sunday he rebuked an old woman for sitting in a dark corner and not coming out into the lighter part of the church, and added : ' Now, my friends, you should consider how you come to church ; some of you come from the north, and some from the south, and it is the same when you"], [214, "202 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. leave the church ; and who knows what will become of us all ? Now, I have a hole in my pocket ; but do any of you possess a rag that will stop that hole ? ' Some thought this sermon good, but a complaint was made to the Provst, who told the congregation that the new priest had spoken in parables, and that he meant by the hole in his pocket that he wanted more gifts from them. A complaint, however, was made to the Bishop, and the charcoal-burner thought his career as priest would be short. So he went and cut part of the pulpit through, so that it would fall easily ; and when he had to preach before the Bishop, he shouted, ' If there be any here that have done wrong, brethren, leave this church ; for I tell you, to-day such a fall shall occur in this church as none of you ever saw the like.' With this he struck the pulpit with his fist, and down it came. Everyone rushed out of the church, as if the last day was come. The Bishop assured the congregation that they could not have a better man, as he was not only a priest but a prophet ; and they had to submit to his administra tion. The King, at this time, was anxious to hear if tbe Queen was going to have a prince or a princess. The Bishop, recollecting the wonderful priest, advised his being consulted. The King, however, determined to try his power of prophecy. He therefore put something into a silver tankard, with a cover to it, and asked the charcoal-burner what was in it. He now thought it was"], [215, "203 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. best to throw himself on the King's mercy; and he ex claimed, ' I am a miserable Krabbe (a small shore-crab),' when lo ! this was the very thing the King had put in the tankard. He was then brought into the presence of the Queen, and the charcoal-burner was indeed perplexed. ' You should not,' he said, ' make a stall for the calf before it is born, or name the child before it sees the light. When the Queen comes before me I think it is a prince ; when she goes away I think it is a princess.' The Queen had twins, a prince and a princess. Thus the charcoal-burner was more lucky than he deserved to be.\" \" Well told,\" said Harild Tyssen ; \" and thank you, Fraken Nordal.\" \" I did not hear the story,\" said John Stirling. \" I only heard the silver ripple of her voice.\" \"You are getting better, John,\" said his sister. \"I saw you understood every word. Good-night, Mr. Tyssen, I must put him to bed now.\""], [216, "204 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. CHAPTER XVIII.

Jacob Oppedal had been expected to return to the S\u00e6ter on the fifth day, and a look-out had been kept down the Fjeld. About mid-day Kristofer reported that he saw two men and three horses coming up from the direction of Opheim, and shortly after he announced : \u2014 \" Nu kommer han Amtmanden og Jacob med.\" \" I will go and meet my father, Fanny,\" said Emilie Nordal ; \" but do not let Herr Tyssen follow me.\" \" Mr. Tyssen,\" said Fanny Stirling, as she saw him about to leave, \" Emilie wishes to speak to her father,"], [217, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 205 and we will tell him that you did not go to meet him in consequence. We shall have to arrange to receive him, and he will have to sleep in the tent, if he does not return to Opheim to-night.\" \" Well, little Ven,\" said the Amtmand to his daughter, \" how is the man you have promised to marry without consulting your father ? You are looking as bright and happy as if you had my consent and blessing.\" \" Thank you a thousand times for coming here, little Father,\" she exclaimed. \" I have so longed to tell you that I knew he was going to speak to me. His sister told me so, and he sent a few lines to me. But he might not have spoken ; and then his accident happened, and I thought he would die ; and I had the strongest wish to see him, if but for a moment.\" \"You were attached to him, Emilie,\" said the Amt mand ; \" and it was not the sudden impulse of seeing him lying ill and helpless ? \" \"No, no, little Father,\" she replied ; \"he has been dear to me a long time. He is so good.\" \" What an earnest little face,\" said the Amtmand , touching her cheek with his hand. \"Your mother is delighted at your prospects of happiness, and so am I.\" \" Thank you, thank you, little Father. You will recol lect his leaving Nordal for Vange, suddenly. He then wrote his sister that he intended to ask me to be his wife, and told her to come to him. She has shown me"], [218, "206 . AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. the letter. He has himself told me that he did not like to speak to me until he felt that he could give me all his heart.\" \" Good,\" said her father ; \" but all this time you have not told me how he is.\" \" He is now sitting in his camp-bed, which makes into a sort of easy-chair. He can stand and walk a little. His arms were badly sprained and he has a difficulty in using his hands ; but every day he grows better.\" \" Welcome to the Fjelds, Herr Amtmand,\" said Fanny Stirling, coming a short distance from the S\u00e6ter hut. \" It is the kindest thing you could do to me and my brother, and to say that I am glad to see you appears an idle phrase.\" \" You look as fresh as a rose, Fanny,\" said the Amt mand. \" The Fjeld air has made you brighter, if such were possible. Harild Tyssen, you look the picture of health ; and now I am longing to see Mr. Stirling.\" The Amtmand grasped John Stirling's hand warmly. \" I am glad to see Stirling wince,\" said Tyssen, \" when anyone shakes hands with him. I have felt his grip several times. His hands are painful yet, Herr Amt mand.\" \" I am glad indeed to see you, Herr Amtmand ; and thank you for taking so long a journey,\" said John Stir ling. \" I fear you will think I have not acted with con sideration for you.\""], [219, "207 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Fanny Stirling drew Harild Tyssen out of the S\u00e6ter hut. \" Will you kindly see Jacob Oppedal unpacks the things sent from Nordal,\" she said, \" and arrange about the dinner.\" \" I have told my father everything, John,\" said Emilie. \" And as I have been told everything,\" said the Amt mand, \" we will say no more until you come to Nordal, except that my wife and I know no one we like so much as Mr. Stirling.\" The Amtmand then gave the friendly messages he had been charged to deliver from Nordal ; and then Fanny Stirling returned. \" We have dinner ready for you in the tent, Herr Amtmand,\" she said. \" John has his dinner here, and I will attend to him, if you and Emilie will go to dinner.\" \" Now my Father is here,\" said Emilie, \" do let me wait on John, Fanny. It will be such a pleasure to me.\" \" Let her, by all means,\" said the Amtmand. \" She should show the man she has promised to marry that she is ready to devote herself to him.\" \" It is so nice to have you to take care of, John,\" she said, as she brought him his simple dinner ; \" and to have you all to myself for a while. My father has spoken so kindly that my heart is full.\""], [220, "208 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Bless you, Blue-eyes,\" said John Stirling, as he some times called her. \"You say my voice is like silver, John,\" she said; \" but every kind word you utter is dearer than gold to me.\" In the tent the Amtmand was very cheerful. He chatted about his journey, about Nordal, and pulled out of his pocket a letter for Harild Tyssen. \" It is from Olava,\" he said ; \" she told me she had written you all the news, and wants you to send back a letter by me.\" Harild Tyssen put the letter into his pocket. \" Why do you not read it ? \" asked the Amtmand. \" Because it will keep until after we have had dinner,\" replied Harild Tyssen. \" You have some other news to tell Mr. Tyssen,\" said Fanny Stirling ; \" your daughter did not wish us to say anything to him until she had seen you.\" \" What is it ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Emilie is forlovet (betrothed),\" said the Amtmand. \" To whom ? \" asked Tyssen. \" To John, of course,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" To John, of course ! \" echoed Tyssen, jumping up in his astonishment. \"Why, I have been with him day and night, and, except the first day I saw him, he never would speak of Nordal. I was certain he liked Emilie, as his manner was always so respectfully kind to her."], [221, "209 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. I told her he was worth waiting for, but I thought it had all gone off.\" \"We could not tell you, Mr. Tyssen,\" said Fanny Stirling, \" against Emilie's wish. She desired to tell her father and receive his sanction first; and as to my brother's not talking about the woman he was going to marry, I think he was right.\" \" Quite right, Miss Stirling,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" I can also keep a secret, and do precisely the same thing.\" \" You have not opened Olava's letter yet, Mr. Tyssen,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" I have not,\" said Tyssen ; \" but I know it will contain venligste Hilsener (literally, friendliest greetings) to Miss Stirling and her brother, an affectionate message to her sister, and will probably refer to the weather.\" \" When do you expect your brother will be able to leave for Nordal ? \" asked the Amtmand. \" At any time,\" said Fanny Stirling ; \" he is strikingly better every day. The pure air up here, and the simple way of living, assists his recovery.\" \" I must return to attend to any business that may arise,\" said the Amtmand. \" We will go and talk to Mr. Stirling about his leaving the S\u00e6ter. I think the sooner he is at Nordal the better for him.\" Emilie Nordal was sitting on a low milking-stool belonging to the S\u00e6ter, looking up at John Stirling, with 14"], [222, "210 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. one of his hands in hers. As her father entered, she did did not rise or draw away her hands. \" You must get him to Nordal and nurse him there little Ven,\" said the Amtmand to his daughter. \" If I might make a suggestion,\" said Fanny Stirling, \" I think John can ride as far as he is able, and the tent be taken on one of the other horses and pitched when he feels he can go no farther. Jacob Oppedal can stay by him, and the rest of us walk on to Opheim, after we have seen him cared for.\" \" Good,\" said the Amtmand ; \" what does Mr. Stirling say ? \" \" That I will go as Fanny says,\" said John Stirling. \" But the walk to Opheim for you, Herr Amtmand \u2014 \u2014 \" \" Is all down the Fjeld and easy for us all,\" interrupted the Amtmand. \" We shall leave a good deal of our belongings behind us,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" Leave them in the S\u00e6ter and fetch them at your leisure,\" said the Amtmand; \"you will not lose as much as a pinch of salt.\" \" That I am sure of,\" said Stirling. \" But now, Mr. Stirling,\" said the Amtmand, \" I have heard Harild Tyssen's version of your accident. What do you recollect about it ? \" \" I slipped on the snow,\" said John Stirling, \" as I was spying out for deer. I felt a stunning blow, and recollect"], [223, "211 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. nothing more until Tyssen was bathing me with hot water here in the S\u00e6ter. I then felt excessive pain and weak ness. The few days that elapsed before the doctor came were the worst ; but Tyssen and Jacob Oppedal kept bathing my bruises, and feeding me with reindeer broth and milk, with a kindness and attention I shall never forget.\" \" Nor I,\" said an earnest voice from Emilie Nordal. \" My view is,\" said the Amtmand, \" that there is good in whatever happens. Mr. Stirling's accident has strengthened the courage and affection of his sister, as well as the attachment that was growing up between him and Emilie. Everything should teach us that God is good.\" \" Det er min Tro (it is my faith),\" said his daughter, kissing John Stirling's hand. \"It has given me a lesson of patience, Herr Amtmand,\" said Stirling, \" which has been hard to bear even under very happy circumstances.\" \" Such a trial will do you no harm,\" said the Amtmand, \" and it will be a pleasant memory in the future.\" \" When we were on the high Fjelds after reindeer,\" said Harild Tyssen, \" there was very little for the deer to feed on of any kind. This must make the support of large herds of deer very difficult for the Lapps farther north.\" \" It is a hard life,\" said the Amtmand ; \" but the 14 *"], [224, "212 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. greatest difficulty is when the deer are driven from one feeding- ground to another to find food for them. The reindeer moss once bitten off by the deer takes a long time to grow again, and tracts have to be found where there is sufficient moss. The autumn is an anxious time, as, if snow does not fall before hard frost, the reindeer cannot get at the moss through the ice that forms on it. If snow has fallen, the deer will get at it with their shovellers, as their lower antlers are called, or scrape the snow away with their forefeet. The Lapps, in driving their deer from one feeding- ground to another, often lose their way in snow-storms. They then have no other resource than to wait under the shelter of a precipice with their deer until the weather moderates. They find their way by landmarks they have learnt from childhood, or by the stars. Storms are frequent, and besides the difficulty of migrating then, they bring with them much hardship. To us the life of the Lapp appears picturesque, but in reality it is a hard one, and possibly is the cause of the depression to which as a rule they appear to be subject.\" \" The winter nights must be exceedingly cold,\" said Tyssen, \" if they are beautiful.\" \" The Lapp is then in his earth hut,\" said the Amt mand. \" The nights that are clear are very beautiful, and the Nordlys, as we call the aurora borealis, is very impressive at times in Lapland. The Finns believe that"], [225, "213 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. the tongues of flame in the aurora are the souls of the dead pursuing the Underjordiske or underground people. They say the latter can sometimes be seen flying with their reindeer before the tongues of flame. The deer of the underground people are known by their horns being of burnished gold. It is very probable that, seen against the sky-line in the snow, any reindeer's horns would look bright under the aurora, that is at times.\" \" Very likely,\" said Tyssen ; \" but the Tatar folk, or gypsies, who wander about so poor a land as Norway must have a hard time of it.\" \" There are not so many of them,\" said the Amtmand ; \" and, as education spreads, their chances of practising on the credulity of the people lessen, and they have to adopt other pursuits. They used, however, to reap a good harvest from the Bander in old silver, clothes, and pro visions, by pretending to cure cattle. They use a language of their own, which is a mixture of Swedish, Norse, and Rommani. They have chiefly recruited the number of men sentenced to penal servitude, or, as we call it, ' Slaveri,' for robbery and violence. In Norway nothing is thought so mean as theft, and the consequence is that where credulity does not fear, honesty despises.\" \"I think I must interrupt, Herr Amtmand,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" If a start is to be made to-morrow for Opheim, it should be early.\" \" We will go and finish our pipes in the tent,\" said the"], [226, "214 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Amtmand. \" It is well Mr. Stirling should not sit up too long. I am anxious about the journey.\" \" We can make the attempt,\" said Fanny Stirling ; \" and there is one thing you may be sure of, and that is there is no want of courage in John.\" \" Nor his sister,\" added the Amtmand."], [227, "215 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

Fru Nordal had arranged a bed-room in the ground floor of the Amtmand's house for John Stirling. \" Hvorledes har De det ? \" said Harild Tyssen, as he entered the room the day after their arrival at Nordal. \" I am all the better for the journey down the Fjelds,\" replied Stirling. \" It is impossible not to feel better when one is surrounded with everything that kindness can dictate or thoughtfulness suggest ; even my sister is outdone by Fru Nordal's careful consideration.\" \"Not much, I think,\" said Tyssen. \"I have, however, a communication to make which may or may not surprise you. Can you guess what it is ? \""], [228, "216 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Not in the least, nor can I imagine,\" replied Stirling. \"Then I will tell you,\" said Tyssen. \"The fact is that the Amtmand is going to hold a grand Forlovelse's Fest over you and Emilie. Now there is one matter that will increase the grandeur of the occasion, and that is that I am engaged to Olava. You see I was bound to fall in love with the youngest princess, and I really have. I was afraid the Amtmand would think me too precipitate, so said nothing. He does not like American quickness. The older world he lives in is slow. You may recollect I warned you that there was a hawk hovering about the dovecote, not at all particular as to which bird he should strike at. I, therefore, secured my bird by a simple explanation of the position.\" \" Have you spoken to the Amtmand ? \" asked Stirling. \" No,\" replied Tyssen, \" because I was accepted on condition that I really cared for her at the end of my stay in Europe. She said I had not had time to know my own mind.\" \" That she must have learnt from her father,\" said Stirling ; \" his view is that attachments arise uncon sciously, and grow slowly.\" \" May be,\" said Tyssen ; \" but I suddenly grew con scious that she should be my wife the first time I heard her sing. It was not only her fine voice, but her simple and kindly manner that made me like her so very much.\""], [229, "217 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" They are very like,\" said John Stirling, thinking of Olava's sister. \" Another reason why I have said nothing,\" said Tyssen, \" is that I at once wrote my father, and on our return here his reply was awaiting me. His letter is most kind. He writes that it is what he longed to hear. He sends five hundred dollars from himself and five hundred dollars from my mother to buy a betrothal gift for Olava. She has, of course, seen the letter, and what do you think she says on the subject ? \" \"A brooch, perhaps,\" said Stirling. \" Not a bit of it,\" said Tyssen. \" She simply said that I should keep the money and buy silver plate, or any necessary articles for our housekeeping.\" \" That is Fru Nordal's influence on her daughters,\" said Stirling. \" Your course now is to show the Amt mand your father's letter ; it will save you an expla nation.\" \" Yes, but Olava will not let me,\" replied Tyssen. \" She says I may not yet know my own mind.\" \" Perhaps,\" said Stirling, \" she is not sure that she likes you well enough to be your wife.\" \" People in Europe appear to me to be so long in making up their minds,\" said Tyssen. \" They appear to think a man i3 born to wait and to be kept waiting. You actually allowed Karl Tobiesen to propose to Emilie when you wanted to marry her yourself. You never"], [230, "218 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. even sent a line or said a word, but waited ; now I should have telegraphed.\" \" It is not well for a man to offer his hand unless he is sure he gives his heart too,\" said Stirling. \" Yes, but I am sure,\" said Tyssen, impatiently. \" Then,\" said Stirling, \" tell the Amtmand the whole story as you have related it to me, and do not wait. You are actually waiting when you should not wait.\" \" But, Olava ? \" said Tyssen. \" Will forgive you,\" interrupted Stirling, \" and I am glad our connection is to be so close, Tyssen \" ; but Harild Tyssen had already left to see the Amtmand. Constant and numerous inquiries were made at Nordal for John Stirling. Many excellent and unfailing reme dies were suggested for bruises and sprains. Many recipes for his food were sent, and many a well-meant present. \" They are kind, John,\" said Fanny Stirling ; \" but they forget you are nearly recovered from the effects of your accident.\" \"Write a short note to each of them in English, Fanny mine, and thank them,\" said her brother. There was a knock at the door, and the Amtmand entered. \" I would not allow you to be disturbed this morning,\" he said. \" You might, however, like to join us at dinner by and by. How do you find him, Fanny ? \""], [231, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 219 \" He is nearly well. The journey down the Fjelds has removed some of the stiffness of which he complained, and, in fact, he now requires moderate exercise.\" \" Thank you, Herr Amtmand,\" added John Stirling. \" I am quite well, but I feel a stiffness in my limbs which will soon wear off.\" \" Harild Tyssen has followed your advice, and been to me,\" said the Amtmand. \"I have referred him to Olava herself. Did you know of his having any attach ment for her, Fanny ? \" \" No, but I thought it possible. Is it a matter of which you approve, Herr Amtmand?\" she said in quiringly. \" I only approve of marriage,\" said the Amtmand, \"when there is sincere attachment on both sides. With your brother and Emilie there was no doubt. I advised Sophie to refuse Karl Tobiesen, because he has within a short period proposed, not only to her two sisters, but to you, and could not possibly have a sincere attachment for her. It might grow to be such, but it cannot exist now.\" \"You are right, Herr Amtmand,\" said John Stirling. \" There would be fewer marriages if everyone had to wait for that,\" said Fanny Stirling ; \" but there is some one who has been anxiously looking for you, John ; and you must go and see her.\" The Amtmand went to his room. John Stirling and"], [232, "220 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. his sister met Emilie in the corridor leading to the Dagligstue, or sitting-room. \" I do so hope you are better,\" she said earnestly. \" Why what is the matter with those blue eyes ? \" said John Stirling, taking her face into his hands and looking into her eyes. \" She got it into her head that fever might result from the effects of the journey down the Fjelds, and has been crying about you, John, all night,\" said his sister. \" Bless you, sweetheart,\" said John Stirling, with his cheery voice. \" I am all right, and love you with all my heart.\" \" I am so thankful you are better, John,\" she said. \" Her eyes are bright enough now,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" Come, Blue-eyes,\" he said, \" let us go to your mother and thank her for her care and kindness.\" \" Det gl\u00e6der os at se Dem saa rask, Herr Stirling,\" said Fru Nordal. \" We are glad to see you so well. You had such a pale, tired look when you arrived here that we have all felt anxious about you.\" \" Thank you very much, Fru Nordal,\" said John Stirling, \" for the trouble you have taken about me ; your thoughtful care I shall never forget.\" \" But it is such a pleasure to us to do anything for you, John,\" said Emilie."], [233, "221 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Indeed, it is,\" added Fru Nordal. Harild Tyssen and Olava now entered the room, the latter blushing and bashful. John Stirling saw at once, even if Tyssen had not spoken, that the matter was settled. \" She has accepted me at last, Fru Nordal,\" he said. \" The argument was that I had not been worshipping her long enough. I exhausted the American language in disputing the point. I then adopted other measures which, if they did not convince, were successful.\" \" My husband told me what to expect,\" said Fru Nordal. \" He approves, if Olava does, and so do I. Our dearest wish is the happiness of our children.\" \"We are to be married to-morrow week,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" To-morrow week ! \" was the general exclamation. \" Indeed, I will not,\" said Olava, firmly. \" You must let my husband settle that,\" said Fru Nordal. \" He is certain to advise what is best for you, Olava, and for you, Herr Tyssen.\" \"In this world,\" said Tyssen, impatiently, \"it is always wait, wait, wait, and to make a man wait when he wants to be married is a tyranny begotten of effete monarchical despotism.\" He said this with such serious earnestness that everyone laughed. He then left the room and sought the Amtmand in his Arbeid's Kammer, or office, and argued the point with him."], [234, "222 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" I am aware,\" he said, \" you have your father's and mother's assent, and that there is no reason for delay ing the marriage on that score ; but we do not think it well for a woman to fix the day of her marriage on the very day she has for once and all said Yes. We do not think it becoming.\" \" But she was engaged to me some time ago,\" urged Tyssen. \" Yes, conditionally,\" said the Amtmand. \" If she had done so definitely she would have told me. Let us think over the great event, and you may rely on my con sideration for yourself. I suppose they told you they should leave it to me ? \" \" They did,\" replied Tyssen. \" Then let the matter drop for to-day at least,\" said the Amtmand. \" We have not even held a Forlovelse's Fest. Occupy your time in preparing a speech for that occasion.\" \" Speech ! \" exclaimed Tyssen, \" I could make it now. You are so slow in Europe.\" \" We do not live to be always in a hurry,\" said the Amtmand ; and Harild Tyssen had to retreat without, as he afterwards stated to John Stirling, having scored a single peg. \" Another glass of Bordeaux, Harild Tyssen,\" said the Amtmand at dinner that day ; \" it will make you feel less in a hurry and enable you to bear the slowness of Europe.\""], [235, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 223 \"I think it is a mistake to lack smartness,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" And I think Herr Tyssen makes a mistake when he touches my foot under the table, believing it to be Olava's,\" said Fraken Sophie. \" You have no business to put your foot where I might naturally expect your sister's to be,\" said Harild Tyssen, with some asperity. \" Why, love distracts him,\" said the Amtmand, laugh ing. \" You had better be soothed, Harild, by the influence of tobacco.\" \"My accident,\" said John Stirling, as they began to smoke, \" has prevented Tyssen from seeing the caper cailzie in its native haunts.\" \" There are none very near here,\" said the Amtmand. \" Our name for them is Tiur, that is, for the male birds ; we call the hen Rai. The best time to observe them is at the commencement of the breeding season, when the cocks fight for the possession of the hens. An old cock crows just before daybreak, and the others answer in defiance. The stronger birds drive away the younger and weaker. The birds are so occupied in these contests that they can then be easily approached and shot. The law allows the cocks to be shot up to the fifteenth of May, but not the hens. There is, however, some talk of altering the law in this respect. The Tiur or male capercailzie, frequents the highest and thickest fir trees ;"], [236, "224 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. and it is necessary to be out before daybreak and listen near. The call of the male bird has three notes. The first is ' Pellep, pellep, pellep, pellep ' ; this is fol lowed by a chuckling sound like ' Kleekop ' ; this is succeeded by a sound like the sharpening of a knife on an uneven grinding-stone. This continues for some seconds, and during this time the Tiur shuts its eyes. As soon as the ' Kleekop ' is heard, and the ' Sk\u00e6ringen ' or grinding-stone note commences, the birds can be approached until it ceases, when he is very wary. As he, however, continues to call, he is easily shot, generally with a small-bore rifle, which makes little noise in com parison to a shot-gun.\" \"But this would be in the spring of the year,\" said Tyssen. \" Certainly,\" said the Amtmand. \" There is a valley near where you were on the high Fjelds, and in that valley are some capercailzie.\" \" Such a bird must have many natural enemies,\" said Tyssen. \"The worst enemy it has is fortunately scarce,\" said John Stirling, \" and it has so valuable a fur that it is becoming very scarce. It is the Gaupe or lynx. Kristofer has often described to me his expeditions on the snow after lynx. It is easy to track them on fresh snow, and, if the track is new, the lynx is soon found and shot, as it cannot travel fast on soft snow. There is another enemy"], [237, "225 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY which does much mischief to the capercailzie. It is the stoat, or, as it is called in Norway, the Raskatte, from Ras, ' a heap of stones.' The stoat has a strong appetite for the eggs of the capercailzie, and does infinite mischief by destroying them. The nest is built on the ground, and generally contains eight or ten eggs. There is another bird which you might like to see, Tyssen,\" added John Stirling, \" and that is the Hjerpe, or hazel hen. It is often attracted by a pipe or whistle, made for the purpose, and then shot. The call of the Hjerpe is ' Tee, hee, tee, tee, tee, tee.' It is easily imitated by a little practice with the call-pipe.\" \" The Hjerpe makes as much noise when it rises as the Tiur, or male capercailzie,\" said the Amtmand. \" The legend is that at one time the Hjerpe was the largest bird in the forest, and had then, as now, white flesh, while the capercailzie, the black-cock, and Ryper, had dark flesh. The Hjerpe was so proud of its position, as the largest bird of the forest, that it wounded the vanity of the other birds before mentioned. They collected together and overpowered the Hjerpe. Each of them tore a piece of the white flesh of the Hjerpe out of its body and ate it. The Hjerpe thus became so small as it now is ; while each of its enemies received an addi tion to its own flesh in a bit of the white flesh of the Hjerpe, which is found close to the breast-bone of the other birds. The only relic the Hjerpe possesses 15"], [238, "226 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. of its former greatness is the noise it makes when it rises.\" \" A quaint legend,\" said John Stirling, \" but there is one thing that Tyssen would rather listen to.\" \" There is nothing I like more than to hear your old world stories,\" said Harild Tyssen, with emphasis. \" Exceot, possibly, Olava's singing,\" said John Stirling."], [239, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 227 CHAPTER XX.

Fanny would like to make her a present, and I have discussed it with her, but we are at a loss what to get.\" \" I am not at a loss,\" said Tyssen ; \" I will bring a jeweller with me with a selection of things, and as they like furs, a man in that line also. They can return in the steamer to Bergen.\" \" Good,\" said Stirling ; \" and thank you very much.\" The Forlovelses Fest was practically a dinner party, and a great gathering. The Amtmand insisted on the betrothing words being said with joined hands and the exchange of rings after the old Norse custom. The Provst delivered a short and good discourse, and Kapellan Hansen another, but rather too long, with an effort at the end to be funny. Speeches were made more or less enthusiastic on so prolific a subject, and a great many healths were drunk.

Now to-day, for instance, with so many guests, no single person has been neglected. All goes like oiled machinery.\" \" I think,\" said John Stirling, \" that it is the result of simple and real kindliness. There is no effort, but a thoughtfulness and care that neglects nothing.\" \"You had the same opinion before,\" said Fraken Tobiesen. \"And that opinion is strengthened,\" said Stirling. \" I daresay you recollect all that I said to you, and think very hardly of me now.\" \" By no means. You said what you thought ; but if you did, it was not necessarily correct.\" \" I admit it,\" she said. \" The Nordals are kind and true, and what I said about Emilie was unfair.\" \" We will ask you to come and see us in England,\" said John Stirling, pleased with her frank admission. \" Sophie Nordal will probably be with us, and you could return with her.\" \" Thank you, Herr Stirling,\" she said ; \" you are kind, and there is nothing I should like better.\" The little steamer that Tyssen had hired met with an"], [242, "230 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. accident to her machinery on the return journey, and he arrived at Nordal only just in time to go through the betrothal ceremony. His non-appearance bad caused much anxiety. \" Surely this is not American quickness, Harild Tyssen,\" said the Amtmand. \" In Europe a man is generally in time on such occasions as this.\" \" The steamer's engines were being driven too fast, and they broke down,\" said Tyssen. \" There comes in American quickness again,\" said the Amtmand ; \" but you have brought two Bergensers with you. One is a jeweller, and the other a furrier in the Strandgade.\" \" Yes,\" said Tyssen. \" They have brought some few things for your daughters to select from as presents on their betrothal, from Stirling and me.\" \"The production of them now,\" said the Amtmand, \" while all our guests are here, will not be opportune. You had better wait until the morning.\" \" I think so too,\" said Harild Tyssen, turning to Olava, who had her arm in his. \" I have Stirling's ring. There is very little stiffness left in his limbs now, by the way he is waltzing with Emilie. I ought to have given him the ring before, but I was so absorbed in the ceremony we have gone through that I forgot it.\" \" May I see it, Harild ? \" asked Olava."], [243, "231 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Tyssen opened the pretty little case he had had made for the ring in Bergen. : \" What splendid diamonds ! \" she exclaimed ; \" how bright they look ! \" \" They are not near so bright as your eyes, Olava ; and, besides, you are a jewel above price,\" said Tyssen ; \" but put the ring on your middle finger. Do you like it?\" \" Yes, much,\" she replied. \" Then I will give you one exactly like it, and glad I shall be to give you anything you really like.\" \" Thank you, Harild,\" she said, giving him her hand to express her thanks in her Norse manner. Harild Tyssen handed the ring to John Stirling, who nodded his thanks. \" I have a present for you, Blue-eyes,\" he said ; and he explained how the ring had come into his possession. \"I promised then,\" he added, \" that the ring should always be kept in my family, and I can think of no more fitting present on my betrothal.\" \" It is beautiful, John ; and to give it me, as you do, is kind indeed.

Our guests expect you to be at his side this evening.\" \" Fanny,\" said the Amtmand, as Stirling's sister ap proached, \" you have been most useful. Thank you, little friend. You have charmed the old people and fascinated the young, and have spared my wife and Sophie much trouble in entertaining our guests. Your kindness in singing some English ballads has interested us all. It is sweet to hear a voice that has been so carefully educated. It is what my daughters lack.\" \" They have fine voices, Herr Amtmand,\" said Fanny, \" especially Olava.\" \" There is much to be done in the direction of im proving the voice by careful training,\" said the Amtmand;"], [245, "233 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" but it is not easy to teach and impossible to do it here.\" The next day Harild Tyssen was informed that the jeweller, the furrier, and the little steamer were alike impatient to return to Bergen. The skipper of the steamer marched up in his sea-boots to Harild Tyssen's room and awoke him. He had received his orders from the owners and must obey them. Harild Tyssen went to John Stirling's room. \" Write a note about it to your sister,\" he said. \" The skipper will not wait, although I have offered him twenty dollars.\" \" I thought a man in Europe was bound to wait,\" said Stirling, as he wrote the note. \" Yes, but this fellow won't. I have got the Kammer jomfru waiting to deliver your note to Miss Stirling; and the two Bergensers are placing their things ready for inspection.\" John Stirling dressed, and inspected with interest the articles shown him. \" What would you like, Fanny mine ? \" he said, as his sister entered. \" They have asked me to select for them, John,\" she said ; \" they are afraid of choosing anything too expen sive, and which the Amtmand and his wife would strongly disapprove of.\" \" What would you like yourself, Fanny ? \" he asked."], [246, "234 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" I should like a sea-otter cape, and should advise that you gave the same to each of the three sisters. Also, I would buy a sealskin jacket for Fru Nordal.\" \" Right, Miss Stirling,\" said Harild Tyssen ; \" but there should be sea-otter skin cuffs to match the capes, and we will share the cost between us, Stirling, and that will do for the furrier. And now, Miss Stirling,\" he added, \"you must help us with the jeweller.\" \" There is a very pretty pearl necklace ; there are some diamond stars and buttons, and some very pretty brooches and bracelets, of Norwegian work,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" The prices are, as far as I can judge, rather less than in England.\" \" But you do not select anything, Miss Stirling,\" said Harild Tyssen. \" If expense be no object,\" she said, \" I say the pearl necklace, one of the diamond stars, and four of the diamond buttons. They will look well at night on a black velvet ribbon.\" \"Right, Miss Stirling,\" said Tyssen; \"but I think that Olava will also like one of these brooches of Norse design for ordinary wear.\" \" Select one for yourself, one for Sophie, and a couple for Emilie,\" said John Stirling. \"And a couple for Olava,\" added Tyssen. \"I have paid into the Bergen Bank more money thin sufficient to cover the cost of our joint purchases, and referred these"], [247, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 235 gentlemen to the bank, and you can settle with me when you please, Stirling.

It was accepted with warm thanks. \" What tact she has, Stirling,\" said Tyssen, sotto voce. \" What a mess we should have made of it. She has not said half a dozen words, but they all fit the occasion.\" \" I fear, Harild Tyssen, you have spent more money than your father will approve of,\" said the Amtmand. \" It is more than I like Olava to accept.\" \" You have not seen my father for thirty years, Herr Amtmand,\" said Tyssen. \" If I had acted differently he would call me a ' mean cuss,' and mean it.\" \" Well, please not take any more steps in that direc tion,\" said the Amtmand, \"until he knows what you have done and we have his reply.

On search being made, he was found in a corner with Olava, very descriptive of America. \" I had forgotten \" he said. \" No doubt of it,\" said Stirling, interrupting. Jacob Oppedal was waiting for them as their Kariols drove up at Vange. He highly approved of John Stir ling's choice of a wife. He said to everyone, \" Hun er en begavet Pige \" (literally, \"a gifted girl \"), adding after an invariable pause, \" med Forstand og (with gumption, too).\" His anxious care of John Stirling was at this time great. He regarded him as being love-sick, and passing through a fever. Although Harild Tyssen was going through the same crisis, Jacob had no sympathy for him. \" The Amerikaner puts flies in Stirling's head,\" he explained. \" Are you going fishing, Stirling ? \" asked Tyssen. \" The season is over,\" replied Stirling ; \" the salmon and trout are gravid. We can have some pleasant walks on the lower Fjelds, and shoot a few Dalryper and an occasional blackcock. Kristofer will be here with his dog Barfod.

At Nordal, Fanny Stirling's common-sense way of talking of the future amused the Amtmand and gave the Amtmandinde satisfaction.

You might tell her, Olava, as a great secret, that she might be married shortly. She may like to make some preparations for the possibility.\" \" She has everything ready,\" said Olava, \" and has had for years. A call may come at any time, and the Kapellan would then marry and go to where his duty directs.\" \" Is there anyone else that wants to be married ? \" asked Fanny Stirling, laughing, and looking at Sophie Nordal. \" No, I do not,\" she said, quickly. \" I cannot accept a man who proposes right and left, as if he were firing at a flock of Ryper. I know what you mean, Fanny ; but I shall wait until the man I like likes me.\""], [257, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 245 \" Will you allow Emilie and me to go to Bergen, Herr Amtmand?\" asked Fanny Stirling. \" We want to make a few purchases.\" \" The Fjord steamer only leaves here once a week,\" said the Amtmand, \" and this would necessitate your remaining in Bergen several days. I cannot go with you, as I have my duties to attend to here. I will write to some friends of mine that will receive you, and this will put you to no expense.\" \" That is just what I should not like,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" I prefer going to an hotel and being perfectly free from kind attentions. I will promise to take care of Emilie.\" \" But what will your brother say to the cost ? \" asked the Amtmand. \" I know John's wishes,\" she replied, \" and I never ask him, because we always unconsciously think the same ; we have lived together so long. He will desire me to do what I see is necessary.\" \"Mor,\" said the Amtmand to his wife, \" we must let this wise little head have its way.\" \" Fanny is our guest,\" said Fru Nordal, \" and can do as she pleases ; but you should not allow her to purchase Emilie's outfit.\" \"It is best that there be no outfit,\" said Fanny Stir ling. \" Emilie will feel more at ease if she has every thing like an English lady of her position, and so will"], [258, "246 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Olava. There is nothing in this direction that I should get. I should like, Herr Amtmand,\" she added, \" if you would suggest some Norse books that we might take to England. I wish to learn Norse more perfectly, and the opportunity will arise for doing so during the winter.\" \" You will find a good bookseller in the Strandgade,\" said the Amtmand ; \" but buy Bjornstjerne Bjarnson's books. He is our novellist, dramatist, and poet. His Synn0ve Solbakken is a pretty pastoral story, and popular. He is a very robust Liberal in politics \u2014 too robust for all of us to follow. His dramas have not been so successful as his novels.\" \"What has he written as a poet?\" asked Fanny Stirling. \" Many things. You can get a collection of his smaller poems in Bergen. He has written many songs, which everybody knows and sings. Some have humour, but there is no fun, while some are fantastic. There is the ballad of ' Ingerid Slet of Silljeland.' The name indi cates a dull person. She inherited a little cap of yellow wool from her mother. This she placed in her clothes chest, to wait until she was married, and to it she made decennial visits ; but at last, when all hope of marriage faded away, she determined to wear the cap ; but, on going to her clothes-chest, she found that, from age, there was not a thread of it left. There is no positive fun in the ballad, but it has been well received in"], [259, "247 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. Norway. The following, called ' Sin*|and Death,' is a specimen of his fantastic style : \u2014 \" Sin and Death, as sisters two Two, two, Sat together at break of day, ' Marry, sister, that I may dwell, Dwell, dwell, In thy house,' said Death, ' alway.' \" So Sin married ; but Death mocked, Mocked, mocked : Fiend-like, danced on the wedding-day, And at night bore the bridegroom, dead, Dead, dead, In a winding-sheet away. \" Sin awoke alone, and wept, Wept, wept ; But Death sat by at break of day. ' Him thou loved,' said Death, ' I love well Well, well. He is dead, and mine for aye.'\" \" There is a poetic weirdness about it that I like,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" There is a little chanson relating to the tiffs that arise between lovers,\" said the Amtmand. \" It illus trates the old story of Amantium ir\u0153 integratio est : \u2014 \" How cross he sits against the wall ! Merry, she dances with one and all ; With one she laughs, A second chaffs. His heart is near to burst in two. Nobody knew. Nobody knew."], [260, "248 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" He will not say, Good-night, good-night. She goes away, her heart not light. She weeps all day, All night, alway. Her hopes of love are small and few. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. \" With him time drags so slow, so slow ; He comes to see how it may go. Her love is sure ; His love is pure ; Their thoughts of love are fresh and new. Nobody knew. Nobody knew.\" \"A very pretty little chanson,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" And if John would not say good-night to you, Emilie, and was unkind, what would you do ? \" \" He cannot be unkind,\" replied Emilie \" There is also an authoress that might interest you,\" said the Amtmand, \" and that is Magdalene Thoresen. There is a good deal of imagery and pathos in her books, and some pretty things, too. In her Solen i Siljedalen is a specimen of the improvisation occasionally yet found in Norway. You will see there is much repetition and fancy, but little depth, in the following, called ' The Lovers ' : \u2014 \" They wandered through the grassy dells, And sunbeams kissed the fairy bells, The fairy bells. How soft, how sweet the blue hare-bell ! What grace the hop-bine has to tell !

A bird is singing on a tree ; He cheers his mate with song so free. A full-blown rose the maiden grows ; The youth has wed his full-blown rose, His full-blown rose.\" \" A good improvisation,\" said Fanny Stirling. \" There is nothing in it, but it is full of song.\" \" There are a great many other authors,\" said the Amtmand. \" But Emilie is acquainted with the litera ture of Norway, and can suggest many books to you, which, when you can read, you will find fresh and new.\""], [262, "250 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY.

Danish Rendering of a Russian Song. \" Kristofer reports that there is a good Ryper terrain about twenty-four English miles to the south of this,\" said John Stirling, one day after dinner at Vange. \" We have had little sport close to this, and, if it were not for the varying scenery on these lower Fjelds, we should have found it monotonous. A walk on the Fjelds always interests. No one day is like another. There is not only the change of prospect, but also its shifting light and colour.\" \"It is passing strange to me, Stirling,\" said Tyssen, \" that you should have your head full of scenery and landscapes, when it might be supposed you had the"], [263, "251 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. subject of Emilie Nordal to think about \u2014 say occasion ally.\" \" I do think of her very often,\" said Stirling. \" But I was early taught to attend to the matter before me, and I have acquired the habit, when out shooting, of ob serving everything closely, and not allowing my mind to wander from keeping a watch for what might suggest something. It. is necessary when shooting on the Fjelds, where game is spread over such an extent of country.\" \" That accounts for an experienced J\u00e6ger like Kristofer being always ready to beat any line of country you think fit to try,\" said Tyssen. \" He knows you are a good finder.\" \"When we left Nordal, Emilie told me her father would like some Dalryper,\" said Stirling. \" It is now Monday. The path to the terrain that Kristofer men tions is rough, and it will take us all Tuesday to walk there. The nights are getting dark, and we cannot travel over the Fjelds at night.\" \" But where shall we sleep ? \" asked Tyssen. \" It is too cold to sleep on the Fjelds now.\" \" There is the choice of two S\u00e6ters. Jacob Oppedal is, as usual, related to the people in some distant way, and can arrange about our sleeping in either, with leave to shoot. It is possible the people may have left the S\u00e6ters for the season ; but we shall pass by a Gaard (farm-house). The owner is the proprietor of the S\u00e6ters,"], [264, "252 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. and Jacob Oppedal will settle everything after the usual two hours' palaver, which is inevitable.\" The next day, at daybreak, John Stirling, Tyssen, Kristofer, and Jacob Oppedal crossed the Vange Elv, and ascended the steep Fjeld on the other side, taking a southerly course, and walking slowly, as they knew the hard walk that was before them. They climbed up three Fjeld ranges, descended their respective valleys, and on reaching the last Dal, Jacob Oppedal pointed out the Gaard they were bound for. Kristofer' s experienced sight observed a cow or two tethered close to the Gaard. \" Kreaturene (literally, the creatures, meaning the cattle) are at home. They have left the S\u00e6ters,\" he said. \" Then we can get some milk and Fladbrod,\" said Stirling, \" while the palaver is going on. We will get Kristofer to attend to that.\" As they approached the Gaard, Jacob Oppedal recog nised the Gaardmand, and began a discursive conversa tion. The snow- fall last winter and the weather during the spring and summer were discussed. Their respective ages and the ages of their families severally were minutely inquired into and ascertained. The state of each other's health and that of their relatives went through the same process, and many general topics were started at random."], [265, "253 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY, At length Jacob Oppedal, with many digressions of a protracted character, led the way to the astounding fact that the Engl\u00e6nder was going to marry one of the Amtmand's daughters and the Amerikaner another. This news took time to be understood. After a while Jacob Oppedal incidentally mentioned that the Eng l\u00e6nder wished to shoot a few Ryper for the Amtmand, and wanted the S\u00e6ter huts to sleep in, and some milk to be sent there. The Gaardmand was at once interested in Stirling and Tyssen, and was ready to assist them in any way ; but first they must come in and see a bride who was getting ready to be married on the following Thursday. \" It is one of his men that is going to be married,\" explained Jacob Oppedal. \" He says that he is an ugly fellow, and that the bride is not good-looking.\" \" We had better go in and see the bride,\" said John Stirling, \" and make her a present.\" The bride, although it was then Tuesday, was having her hair combed out by two intended bridesmaids. It is the custom for a bride of the Bonde class to wear her hair loose at the wedding, and some difficulties appeared to arise, which need not be too closely entered into. \" What does the Amerikaner think of the bride ? \" asked the Gaardmand, with a friendly slap on Harild Tyssen's back, and which would certainly have killed a"], [266, "254 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. fly. Er hun ikke saa styg som Fanden (is she not as ugly as the Evil One) ? \" \" No,\" said Tyssen, decidedly. \" But what does the Amerikaner think ? \" asked the Gaardmand, with another mighty slap. \" That she is more ugly,\" said Tyssen. This was a joke with which the Gaardmand had the deepest sympathy. He rushed to the bride and repeated it. It was an act of politeness to her that she should be the first to hear what was said of her. A great con sumption of 01 (beer) was at once directed, that everyone near might appreciate. Without 01 it is difficult some times to enjoy a joke, possibly because both are usually small. John Stirling, however, cut this short, as well as a descriptive essay on the part of Jacob Oppedal on the subject of the Frakener Nordal, and pressed on to the nearest S\u00e6ter, which they found untenanted \u2014 except by the fleas. The ground they beat the next day was a succession of ravines. The sides afforded shelter to the dwarf birch and heather, thus forming a cover for the Dalryper. Kristofer led his dog Barfod, at the end of a long string, up a ravine, with Jacob Oppedal beating the cover on the side of the declivity. Stirling and Tyssen walked on the opposite sides of the ravine. \" Go at a moderate pace,\" said Stirling, \" and do not"], [267, "255 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. speak. It is not like shooting Fjeld Ryper. If Jacob Oppedal shouts, stop. The birds will not lie as they do earlier in the season, and we must go as quietly as possible.\" The birds were wild, and there was much difficulty in getting within shot ; and as those that went away flew over others, the latter also rose, and out of shot. At last John Stirling, by quick shooting, got a brace, and Jacob Oppedal began to clap his hands and shout. Kristofer hit him with a well-directed stone, and John Stirling made him walk a few paces behind him, giving him everything he possibly could to carry. \" The birds are all going into a thin birch wood a mile or so away,\" said Stirling. \" We will try the next ravine, and come round by a mile the other side of the wood ; by that time they may lie better ; the wind will be then in our favour.\" When they had beat through the next ravine, John Stirling called a halt. \" We have only five birds,\" he said ; \" and they are so wild that I think we had best beat towards each other. The easiest shooting is firing at a bird when rising from the ground, and I think, Tyssen, you had better beat the birch wood, and I will go with Jacob Oppedal, keeping opposite and going towards you. If you put up any birds they may come within range of my gun ; and if you have Jacob Oppedal with you, he may shout and put up every"], [268, "256 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. bird like a lot of sky-rockets. When you begin to beat, put your handkerchief on the muzzle of your gun ; I shall see it, and will answer in the same way.\" As they commenced to beat, Harild Tyssen was heard firing at the birds that rose in front of him, and as they passed John Stirling, he shot several, and would have shot more if Jacob Oppedal could have been kept quiet. \" I think we shall get a good many brace,\" said John Stirling, as Tyssen and Kristofer came up. \" We have ten or eleven brace, and the birds will lie better in the afternoon. Jacob Oppedal,\" he added, \" you must take the Ryper and our things from the S\u00e6ter hut we slept in last night to the other S\u00e6ter, which is about eleven English miles distant. Light the fire and get all ready. We shall go slowly to the S\u00e6ter.\" Jacob Oppedal obeyed, undertaking what was really hard work with pleasure. \" There he goes,\" said John Stirling, \" with a heavy load of Ryper, and more weight to carry from the S\u00e6ter, going a dozen miles as if it were only a dozen yards.\" \" Are we likely to find any more Dalryper here ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Not for a few miles,\" replied Stirling. \" The birds here are packing, and, until we get into another lot, we shall not see a feather. Each of us had better keep fifty yards from Kristofer and his dog, and let them go between us, and close up if we find any birds.\""], [269, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 257 After nearly two hours' walking, Kristofer halted and gave a low whistle. Barfod was straining at the cord by which he was held. John Stirling beckoned to Harild Tyssen. An old cock Ryper rose, and afterwards a few younger birds, all affording easy shots. \" Et Kuld (a covey),\" said Kristofer. \" They have not begun to pack yet.\" When they reached the second S\u00e6ter, Jacob Oppedal was at the door, peering at the weather; and as they approached he said, \" Stirling will not shoot any Ryper to-morrow. There will be rain and much wind.\" \" We have nineteen brace,\" said Stirling, \" and if we use a few, there will be enough left for the Amtmand, and some for him to send to his friend Provst Simonsen. Jacob Oppedal is right about the weather. The wind will begin to rise in the night, and to-morrow it will blow a gale. It will moderate in the afternoon, when we can walk to the Gaard and sleep there, and the next day reach Vange.\" \"And the next day Nordal?\" added Tyssen. \"You had, of course, forgotten that.\" \" I have not forgotten it,\" said Stirling ; \" but even a photograph fades when it is too frequently exposed to the light.\" They had not been forgotten at Nordal. On the Saturday, when they were expected, a rarely-used old 17"], [270, "258 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. telescope had been brought to bear on a point of the road from Vange where a Kariol could be seen passing, a considerable distance from Nordal. \" Your brother said he would be here at two o'clock,\" said the Amtmand. \" Then he will be here at two o'clock,\" said Fanny Stirling, \" that is, if he does not meet with an acci dent.\" \"Oh goodness, Fanny!\" said Emilie Nordal, \"don't talk of accidents.\" \" Why, Emilie, you are as pale as can be,\" said Fanny. \" You must not let John see such a face as that. Come out in the garden and walk up and down on the path with me. The time will pass more quickly than when we sit waiting here. He said he would be here at two o'clock, and I am sure he will be.\" And at two John Stirling came. There was the brightest of faces to meet him, and Harild Tyssen had the same experience. Jacob Oppedal, who was with a third Kariol, looked on with intense satisfaction. \" Et smukt Par (a fine couple), Herr Amtmand,\" he said, taking his hat off and putting it under his arm, which was his way of showing his greatest respect. \" So they have brought you, Jacob,\" said the Amt mand. \" There are many Ryper for the Herr Amtmand, and Stirling did not wish me to walk to Nordal,\" he ex-"], [271, "259 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. plained. \" Stirling wished me to remain at Vange ; but I said I should walk to Nordby, so Stirling ordered three Kariols, one for the Amerikaner, one for himself, and one for me. Smukt as ham var det (it was nice of him).\" \" Tell me something, Blue-eyes,\" said John Stirling, after kind welcomes had been uttered by the Amtmand and his family. \" I am so glad to see you that I can say nothing, John,\" said Emilie Nordal, \" except that Fanny has been so good to me.\" \" We are going to Christiania next week,\" said John Stirling. \" Is there anything I can get for you ? \" \" To Christiania ! \" she exclaimed. \" That is a long distance. Is it really necessary to go so far ? \" \" Tyssen, who is accustomed to long distances in America, thinks it a very short journey. His father wishes him to see Christiania.\" \" But need you go, John ? \" she said, imploringly. \" Well, Fanny mine,\" said John Stirling to his sister, as she joined them, \" so you ran away that I might have a chance of speaking a word with Emilie first. What have you to say about her ? \" \" That she is everything you can wish, John,\" she replied. \" She has taught me that when a woman marries she should give her will as well as her heart, and that it is best for her to do so.\" 17 *"], [272, "260 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" Det er min Tro,\" said Emilie. \" And good faith on which to build a happy future,\" said Fanny Stirling, kissing her. \" And a good thing it is to read such a faith in such blue eyes,\" said John Stirling, \" only I doubt it in prac tice. There are so many ways for a lady's will to manifest itself and attain its object.\" \" Your sister has arranged everything,\" said the Amt mand, that day at dinner. \" Even Kapellan Hansen is to be married, if good news comes from America. The bridesmaids are all to be Bondekl\u00e6dt (in national dress), and there is nothing left unconsidered and unprovided for, and for this you have to thank your sister's wise little head.\" \" And Fru Nordal,\" added Fanny Stirling. \" I am sure of it, and thank you very much, Fru Nordal,\" said John Stirling. \" We cannot understand, Mr. Stirling,\" said the Amt mand, \" why you should go to Christiania now. Why not call there on the way to England, and go by way of Copenhagen and Hamborg? \" \"But, Herr Amtmand,\" said Tyssen, \" I do not possess a wedding garment.\" \" Which, if necessary,\" added the Amtmand, \" can be procured nearer here.\" \" Don't go, John,\" said an appealing voice near him \" It is so far from me.\""], [273, "261 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY \" I thought your will was to give way to mine,\" said John Stirling to his blue-eyed betrothed. \" Your beau tiful theories are empty phrases. I shall tell Fanny that you are not to be trusted.\" John's intention was only to banter ; but her nature was too delicate to bear it without pain. She rose quickly from the dining-table and went out. He saw his mistake and followed her. \" Is there anything the matter? \" asked Fru Nordal. \" There is a conflict of wills about Christiania,\" ex plained Fanny Stirling. \"We should not, I think, even say that we do not wish Mr. Stirling to go to Christiania,\" said Fru Nordal. \" My husband might suggest something different ; but Emilie is in the wrong to say she does not wish it.\" John Stirling returned with Emilie Nordal, whose face was bright and blushing, and as they took their seats at the table he said, \" I have had, of course, to give way, and that unconditionally.\" \"And so have I,\" added Tyssen. \" I see I shall hold the reins, and shall be told where to drive.\" \" My experience,\" said the Amtmand, laughing, \" is that my wife suggests, and her suggestions I have had to follow.\" \" With the result that everything has gone well with you, Oscar, and our happiness has been great,\" said Fru Nordal."], [274, "262 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"It is the same tyrrany,\" said Harild Tyssen; \"an outcome of a system of monarchies and despots.\" He said this so earnestly that there was a general laugh. \" Indeed, I will give my will to you, John,\" said an earnest voice in his ear ; \" but I could not bear that you should be so far away, and I feared you might meet with an accident.

Harild Tyssen and his wife arrived at St. Boss just before Christmas. They had been staying in London and Paris. He had a great wish to see John Stirling in his own house ; but he had pictured in his mind a different place than what John Stirling's house really was. \" I am so glad that I did not see a photograph or a sketch of your house, Stirling, before I came here,\" said Tyssen. \" The old stone house, standing in a green lawn, surrounded by a thick wall, gives an impression"], [276, "264 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. of strength enough to resist time. It would stand a i, siege. \" It has,\" said Stirling. \" The well-cut stone gables, with the balls of stone at the top of the gables, give an effect of simplicity and neatness that I like. The ivy, I see, has the same con stant attention as the green lawn. I like the place more than I thought possible. A man cannot live here without being subject to its influence. I have heard much of the impressions created by your English homes, but I now understand the subject. It is not personal influence, but the thoughts that arise from a surrounding that has become classic and historical. Your sister's courage and devotion to you, when you nearly died from that fall on the Fjelds in Norway, was born here. As an American, there is nothing strikes me so strongly as the old home steads of an English family.\" \" We are an old country compared with the States,\" said Stirling. \" I think the society of your intellectual classes,\" said Tyssen, \" is good ; but it does not attract or appeal to the heart like the crystal \u00c6rlighed (literally, honesty) of the Amtmand and his family. There nothing jars; all is simply true. In the English families that I have visited there is always a reserve. I cannot say there is a reason for it, but it exists. With the Amtmand and his family the life and thoughts of all were apparent.\""], [277, "265 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" I thought,\" said Stirling, \" that you had an under standing with Olava that was not cleared up until some time after.\" \" True,\" replied Tyssen ; \" but it was on the under standing that it should not be kept secret, if there was anything in it. I was serious in my intentions from the first. Olava's view was that she wanted time to consider, and she said I had not taken time to consider ; and she was right. She had unconsciously learnt this from her father. He had taught them all that, if love comes, to let it stay. I think even John Stirling took time to con sider.\" \" To be sure of myself,\" said Stirling. \"Just so,\" said Tyssen; \"the same thing. It does not, however, affect what I say, that the transparency of life in the Amtmand's family is the best phase society can exhibit.\" \" You have observed much and thought more,\" said Stirling. \"It is what I came to Europe to do,\" said Tyssen. \" The Amtmand has taught me much without my realising it until I came to England. He has shown me that, instead of trying to win good opinions, it is best to be simple and true, and that then they will be deserved and won.\" \" That lies very much on the surface,\" observed Stir- ling."], [278, "266 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"When an invention is clever,\" said Tyssen, \"it is easily understood. Many discoveries have lain on the surface until picked up by men of more direct minds than others. As the Amtmand says, it is best to be ligefrem, or direct, in every relation of life. In your English society this appears to exist, but in the Amt mand's family it is a reality that is seen.\" \" Let us go in to lunch,\" said John Stirling. \" We have been walking round the house since your arrival, and my wife and Fanny will be glad to see you.\" \" And how does Mrs. John Stirling like England ? \" asked Tyssen, as they joined the ladies at lunch. \" I cannot do otherwise than like England, when I see it with John and Fanny,\" she replied ; \" and as for this dear old house, I love it.\" \" Olava has suffered from Hjemve (home-sickness), and that notwithstanding our rapid movements and sight seeing,\" said Tyssen. \" I cannot say that I have not,\" said Emilie Stirling ; \" but John is good to me. Fanny takes me for walks on the cliffs, where I see the great ocean and its constant changes. I feel that life has changed for me, and that my happiness is great.\" \" I envy the quiet you have here, Emilie,\" said Olava. \" We have been rushing to and fro.

It is a certain find.\" \" I should like to see an English fox-hunt beyond everything,\" exclaimed Tyssen. \" Then we will go, by all means,\" said John Stirling. \" I have not been out for the season.\" \" Is there any danger, John ? \" asked his wife. \" You shall go, too, and see for yourself, wifey mine,\" he said, kissing her. \" You must not be so timid and look so suddenly pale and anxious.\" \" You must recollect, John,\" said his sister, \" that she has heard of your having met with bad accidents with those colts of yours, as well as seen you when badly hurt.\" \" All old stories,\" he said. \"But now, Tyssen, if you would like a walk before dinner, come into my room, and I will find you a pair of boots adapted to a Cornish farm for this time of the year.

A stable-boy appeared."], [280, "268 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"Let Shot out and come with us,\" he said. An old spaniel bundled out of the kennel, and the stable-boy caught the game-bag that was thrown to him. \" We shall find some pheasants and a few rabbits in the hedge-rows, and in the lower meadows a few snipe,\" said Stirling, \" and you will see the farm.\" \" I have never seen a pheasant, except in the game shops,\" said Tyssen. \" Then you soon will, maister,\" put in the stable-boy. \"I seed dree rin into thicky cornder,\" pointing to a hedge corner. \" What does he mean by ' thicky ' ? \" asked Tyssen. \" Is it thicket ? \" \" He is a Devonshire lad,\" replied Stirling, \" and in Devonian ' thicky ' means simply ' that.'

Blaze away ! \" he added ; and Harild Tyssen had shot his first pheasant and missed another. \" Why did you not shoot ? \" he asked. \" The birds that went away were hens,\" replied Stir ling ; \" but you can shoot either cocks or hens, or anything except a fox.\" Harild Tyssen was interested in the farm. He inquired minutely into the management of the land, the sheep cattle, and horses."], [281, "AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. 269 \" What a pleasant life it is ! \" he said. \" It induces the best of health ; there is no worry, and it keeps the heart kindly.\" \" You had better buy an estate in England, and farm sufficient of it to occupy you ; to make it pay is another matter,\" said Stirling. \" I have a duty to the best of parents,\" said Tyssen. \" They would not like me to live far from them.\" John Stirling drove them all in his wagonette to the meet of the fox-hounds. His own and his sister's horse had been sent on with a quiet old horse for Harild Tyssen. \" Jerry,\" said John Stirling to his man-servant, who was with the horses, \" if they find a fox in the brake, he will go down wind to Shilson Woods. Drive the ladies to the top of the hill above, and let them see as much of the run as you can. You will see how the fox is heading.\" \" A very handsome importation, John,\" said Sir Henry Lezant, the master of the fox-hounds, as he rode up. \" We are very glad to see you, and are all longing to make Mrs. Stirling's acquaintance.\" John Stirling introduced his party to those he knew, and had to suffer the usual banter. \"I suppose we shall see no more straight riding, John,\" said Sir Henry, as John Stirling was putting his sister on her horse. \" Your sister, however, can give you"], [282, "270 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. a lead.

They called some time since at St. Boss; and, instead of making a formal call, come to lunch. Your American friend will like to see the kennels.\" \"He will very much, and thank you, Sir Henry,\" replied Stirling. Emilie Stirling had not seen her husband before in his hunting-dress, and John Stirling was a man who looked well in pink. The hounds and hunting party were a novelty to the two Norse ladies, and they were much interested. Their attractive appearance had delayed drawing the brake, and the old huntsman became impatient. Those very near him could hear him blessing, after his fashion, a \" parcel of wimmen.\" \" Trot down the western end, John,\" said Sir Henry. \" You know what to do. Let him get well away before you give a sound.\" Presently all were in motion. Harild Tyssen was about to follow John Stirling, but was called back. \" You can follow your friend shortly, Mr. Tyssen,\" said Sir Henry. \" Kindly wait here for a moment. You may prevent the fox breaking cover, or make him slip back again. It is difficult to dislodge him from these stiff brakes.\""], [283, "271 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. After a short time a hound gave a note. \" That 's Monarch,\" said Sir Henry. \" The fox is in the brake.\" The rest of the hounds took up the scent, and, after a good deal of dodging in the stiff furze on the part of the fox, a cheery voice was heard from the western end of the brake. \" If you stand up in the carriage, Ma'am,\" said Jerry, touching his hat to his mistress, \" you will see the hounds come out of the brake and settle down after the fox. That was master's ' Gone away ! ' that you heard. It means that the fox has got away and made a bolt of it. You can see the hounds all close together \u2014 a blanket would cover them \u2014 and going fast. Master is on the dark bay, taking the first fence. He rides well, does master. He is riding now to let Miss Fanny get up to him. I never did see a prettier find, or the hounds so well laid on. It will be a short run, but sharp.\" \" Can you see Mr. Tyssen ? \" asked Mr. Tyssen's wife, who understood little of Jerry's explanatory de scription. \" Yes, Ma'am,\" replied Jerry ; \" he has tumbled off at the first fence, but he ain't hurt. The ground's soft there. Somebody has caught his horse, and he is getting up again. I expected he interfered with the old horse's mouth at the fence, and made him straddle it.\" \" What ought he to have done ? \" she asked."], [284, "272 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \"Why, you see, Ma'am, the old horse knew his busi ness, and should have been let take the fence in his own way. Mr. Tyssen ain't hurt ; he is going on well now. I see master is hanging back to speak to him. He nurses the bay by it.\" \" What do you mean by ' nursing the bay ' ? \" asked Mrs. Stirling. \" It 's stiff going there, Ma'am, and he is easing his horse.\" \" Do you understand, Olava ? \" \" Not in the least,\" she replied. \" By your leave, Ma'am,\" said Jerry, \" we will drive to Shilson Wood. I see Sir Henry thinks the fox bas gone that way, by the direction he is riding.\" Jerry drove at a fast trot through lanes and bye places, with which he was well acquainted. At times they heard the hounds, when Jerry pulled up and listened. \" They have turned away from Shilson Wood, Ma'am,\" said Jerry. \" I expect a sheep-dog or something has headed him. They are coming up the valley. I knew the fox would not stand long ; he was too hard-pressed at the beginning of the run. Master always says that it is the first three minutes as does it.\" \" I do not understand a word you say, Jerry,\" said his mistress. \" Do you know where Mr. Stirling is ? \" \" Master is not far off,\" replied Jerry. \" They have"], [285, "273 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. killed the fox. I heard a ' who-hoop ! ' then.\" Aud Jerry drove on, listening intently. Shortly after John Stirling rode up. \" We have killed our fox, and Sir Henry has given Fanny the brush,\" he said. \" Is Harild hurt ? \" asked Olava. \" Not the least. He is in a great state of excitement and delight. He has just said that there is nothing he loves so much as \" Here John Stirling made a pause, and added, \" fox-hunting.\" \" Then I shall not let him go fox-hunting,\" said Olava, with determination. \" What a mess you are in, John,\" said his wife. \" You are covered with mud from head to foot.\" \"They always gets like that, Ma'am,\" said Jerry, putting his oar in. \" The ground 's mighty soft this weather. Mr. Tyssen's coat was black this morning; now it 's mucks.\" Harild Tyssen and Fanny Stirling now rode up to the wagonette, her handsome face looking the brighter for the sharp run. \" Are you hurt, Harild ? \" asked his wife \" No ; I only fell off once, and then Stirling told me to let my horse go as he liked, and I never rode so clever a horse. I will give you a thousand dollars for him, Stirling.\" \" Nonsense ! \" said John Stirling. \" It is an old horse, 18"], [286, "274 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. and not worth the expense of taking to the States ; but if you wish to have it, I will give it to you.\" \" You are not to go hunting any more,\" said Mrs. Harild Tyssen, emphatically ; \" and you are not to get too fond of anything. It is not right of you, Mr. Stirling, to encourage him to be so.\" \" What do you say, wifey mine ? \" asked John Stir- ling. \" That fox-hunting is not a subject for jealousy.\""], [287, "275 CHAPTER XXIV. Jeg er saa ung, og Livet r\u00e6kker Mig hver en Blomst, jeg peger paa. Og ydmygt for min Fod sig l\u00e6gger, Hvad nys jeg stolt og opreist saa. I am so young, and every flower Beyond my grasp life reaches me. What late I thought too high, too far, Low at my feet beseeches me. H. P. Holst. Harild Tyssen was to leave for New York in February. \" Well, Stirling,\" he said one day, when they had adjourned to John Stirling's own room for a smoke, \" there is one thing I must confess, and that is, I like your English country life. I have heard much about it from Englishmen in New York, but its reality exceeds what I had imagined. The men we meet at cover- side or at a shooting party are reserved at first ; but they thaw after a while, and I like some of them very much.\" \" It is not absolutely necessary, then, to be born in the United States ? \" asked Stirling. \" You mean that I think those who are born under"], [288, "276 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. monarchies are down-trodden slaves, bound hand and foot, and can develop nothing,\" replied Tyssen. \" Yes ; but practically you are republican, only with a good deal of what is useless connected with your schemes of govern ment, both in England and Norway. There is a want of directness, which I cannot deny has its good side ; but, as far as I can see, your real tyrant is taxation ; it is too heavy. But then it is your own doing. In New York the heavy cost of living is a burden. There is great expenditure \u2014 possibly the right word to use is extrava gance. In England many of your systems are worn out, and you pay heavily in taxation, because, somehow, you cannot manage to upset them. The worst thing I see is, that your burdens do not lessen, they increase, while minute legislation oppresses every class ; and, strange to say, you vote for the very men who make a mess of governing you. There is much said in your representa tive assembly, and it is clear that, as a rule, the intention is good ; but what does it result in but more taxation and meddling laws ? \" \" It is difficult to deny,\" said Stirling. \" With regard to trade and commerce \u2014 what have the men who govern you done? Nothing but throttle it. How have they treated the silver question ? There is said to be 750 millions of silver money in the world \u2014 a guess, I should say ; but, whatever the sum may be, it is large, and necessary for carrying on the world's com-"], [289, "277 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. merce. Your wise men refuse to recognise its value or use. To many of us Americans the wisdom of this is not apparent. Your trade is declining from this cause, because the result is an enormous loss. It is said that Bismarck's financial policy of demonetising silver in Ger many cost that country 80 odd millions. Your loss is greater and conspicuous. Possibly your financial theo rists are too clever, and there is no room for common sense.\" \" It requires a special education to deal with such a subject,\" said John Stirling. \" The idea is that Mr. Gladstone's views on the subject are sound, and poli ticians on both sides of the House are content to leave this matter to his judgment.\" \" I cannot see that any man's judgment is sound, if it leads to national loss,\" replied Tyssen. \" What is a rupee worth in England now ? The exchange is quoted at Is. 6d. and a fraction, instead of at 2s., and, theorise as you will, you are suffering the loss. It is beyond argument because it 's fact.\" \"You are a bimetallist,\" said Stirling. \" Possibly ; but if silver is money, and wanted as such, is the idea a delusion ? Your own silver coinage is a set of tokens, yet it circulates as money, and twenty shillings is the change for a sovereign, but your silver tokens are worth much less. In simple words, your wise men make you take a silver money standard at home, but a low one"], [290, "278 AN AMERICAN IN, NORWAY. abroad. Your producer at home pays in a gold standard to make up his productions ; he then sends to India, where your great trade lies, and is paid in a depreciating currency. Who suffers this loss but the Englishman ? I have an idea that money is useful, then why not support so good a servant ? Has not silver served as money for ages ? \" \" Yes ; and you put it cleverly,\" said Stirling ; \" but it is a subject men of my class do not understand.\" \" It does not come in your way or within your lines of thought ; but it ought with the men you send to Parlia ment,\" said Tyssen. \" Is there anything else in our institutions, as you call them, that we make a mistake in ? \" asked Stirling. \" Yes, in your system for the relief of the poor ; and this is a subject which comes nearer home,\" said Tyssen. \" When I was with you at your local assembly at the workhouse, I saw you not only had a number of children educated in the workhouse, but they resided there \u2014 of all places in the world, the worst for them, if you do not wish them, as adults, to fall back on the workhouse. If the same system exists in every union, as you call your local assembly, throughout England, all I can say is, that it is a mistake, and a bad mistake. You do, in fact, rear a pauper class, and the British rate-payer, whose wisdom does not appear to be excessive, thus picks a stick for his own back.\""], [291, "279 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" It is so,\" said Stirling ; \" but what would you do ? \" \" Not be so foolish,\" said Tyssen. \" If the remedy cost you something at first, it would pay in the end ; but what a benefit it would be to the class in question ! \" \"I admit what you say, every word,\" said Stirling. \" But what can I do ? \" \" Knowing so little about England, I cannot answer that,\" replied Tyssen. \" It only appears to me that it is difficult in England for common-sense to find a hearing.\" \" Is there more ? \" asked Stirling. \" Yes ; your educational system for the poorer class goes beyond the original idea of your Parliament, when it passed what you call Forster's Act. You actually educate that class better than the class that \u2014 numeri cally, if not in value, pays the cost. I have observed that there is some effort to adjust this, but it is feeble.\" \" There is a strong feeling on the subject,\" said Stir ling ; \" but it has had little opportunity of expression.\" \"Just so,\" said Tyssen. \"You English people bear and bear, and the still small voice of common-sense cannot be heard for long speeches and obstruction.\" \" Well,\" said Stirling, \" you have attacked the British Constitution, as you term it, and forcibly, too. But, to change the subject, let me ask, when do you propose visiting this misgoverned country again? \" \" Next year, and to go to Norway,\" replied Tyssen, \" But you must come and see us in New York.\""], [292, "280 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. \" I cannot this spring,\" said Stirling, \" as Fanny will be married as soon as her soldier comes home from India. But come I will, and my wife, too.\" About a month after this conversation, John Stirling received the following letter from Harild Tyssen : \u2014 \" We arrived in New York some days since, but I have delayed my letter until I could write fully about Olava. My father and mother were glad to see me after so long an absence, but their delight in Olava completely fills their minds. She is in a fair way to have her head turned with so much that is new to her. I have received the sharpest reproofs my father ever inflicted on me for not attending to my wife, and my good mother has repeat edly said that my wife ought to have greater consideration from me. My father's pride is to introduce her to his friends as ' my son's wife,' and then he adjusts his spec tacles and observes with delight the admiration exhibited for a very handsome woman. He subjected me to a cross examination as to what I had given Olava, and, as she was present, she expected that I should be severely repri manded for buying the pearl necklace and getting a diamond ring made in London like the one you gave Emilie. She took the ring off her finger, and said she would fetch the necklace, and that she feared I had been imprudent ; possibly he might sell both articles, and she had no doubt I should be more careful in future. ' He does not deserve you, my dear child,' said my father ;"], [293, "281 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. ' he is a shabby fellow.' My mother chimed in to the same tune. Olava was in great distress, for both my father and mother looked at me as if I had committed a grave offence. I could not help laughing, which made matters worse, and Olava looked pained and vexed. During the day several packages of jewellery of con siderable value, that had been selected by my mother, arrived. ' There, my child,' said my father, ' we wish to make up for Harild's stingy ways to you.' I tried to explain that Olava did not like my giving her presents of value. ' Nonsense ! ' said my father ; ' the fact is, you do not know how to behave to your wife. A handsome woman should have good jewellery.' ' We will do what we can, my child, to make him behave well to you,' added my mother. They both speak Norse to Olava, and are never tired of hearing of Nordal. My father's pleasure in listening to her is so evident in his honest and kindly face, that Olava has learnt that it is in this way that she can return their goodness to her. \"Olava has told them much about you, and if you come here your reception will be most cordial. She has told them of my intention of sending your good sister a present on her marriage, and my father, carried away by Olava's warm praise of her, exclaimed, ' For God's sake, Harild, don't be mean in such a matter ! ' I shall con sequently consult him, and the result will probably be worthy of your sister's acceptance. Olava will write her 19"], [294, "282 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. sister, and you will see the letter, as there is no half confidences with the Nordals. \" I send you a thousand thanks for a thousand kind nesses, and miss you more than I can say. My father's and mother's message is to beg that you will come to see them before they die, and the pleasure of your coming here will be to me great. \" Yours always, \" Harild Tyssen.\" A short time after, John Stirling received a letter from the Amtmand, of which what follows is an extract : \u2014 \" The letters we receive from America and England gladden us. My old friend, Hans Tyssen, is good towards Olava. That she was my daughter was enough to insure that ; but he writes that she has brought happiness to him and his wife in their declining years. He says it is so sweet to hear her speak Norse, and of me, and that the pleasure of hearing her sing the old Norse songs is great. Her manner, he writes, towards him and his wife is that of duty and consideration, and that every kindness they show her is repaid by the delight they have in her. This is well to hear, and it will gladden you, as it does us. \" Emilie's letters make us long to see her in her happi ness. They contain ripples of gossip and description, but they have one note, and that is, how good you are to her."], [295, "283 AN AMERICAN IN NORWAY. We look forward to see you in May, and are grateful beyond expression to that higher will that has formed our children's destinies. \" Kapellan Hansen and Fru Hansen have written to me that they are well. The latter's anxiety now is, that the length of the Kapellan's sermons weary his American congregation. Possibly time and experience will correct this.\""], [296, "LONDON : PRINTED BY W. H.
