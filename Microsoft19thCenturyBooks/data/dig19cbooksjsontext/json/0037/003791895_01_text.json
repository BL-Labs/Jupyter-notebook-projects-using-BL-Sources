From the west the dappled down of the soft clouds floated by o'er the blue of the glowing day, from the west fresh-gathered, and blown by its breath till they melted away in the haze of the eastern sky : and below and afar she could spy many-scattered over the deep the ships in their lazily heaving pride, with sail full-spread and glistening side, drifting on like swans asleep ; and nearer she marked the cormorant glide, and the seagull hover and skim,"], [16, "PRELUDE X the shoal, days and the dance of the breezes that dimpled as if it were daintily crimped in a bowl by a finger rubbed on the rim.

To one already destitute of other near relatives it is more than hard. To a son at the age of twenty it is perilous. He has outgrown adaptability to a stranger's guidance, but not the need for supplement to his own. To Lawrence Westerton his mother had been no more than the bright angel of his father's recollec tions. He was their only child. His father had married late in life; yet Lawrence was in his second year at Cambridge and entered at Lincoln's Inn for the Bar when he was left to stand alone. So had he stood some five or six years before you make his acquaintance. Mr. Clement Westerton had been a solicitor, of the firm of Westerton, Marshlands, & Newbody, if A"], [20, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 2 you care to know, though it is not important ; and had, by the time he died, accumulated sufficient to leave Lawrence a capital representing some eigh teen or nineteen hundred a year \u2014 which is a suffi ciently dangerous sum too \u2014 and prospects from the kindness of the firm, to whom he was commended, if he showed himself decently capable. Lawrence had been called some two or three years back, and had displayed the requisite capacity over the few briefs entrusted to him so far ; though indeed he was not particularly well fitted for the profession his father had chosen for him, being of a somewhat too contemplative and withal unaccom modating disposition. He had entered upon it, after finishing his time at Cambridge and taking an unob trusive degree, more out of regard for the old man's dying wishes than any great liking for it himself or expectation of more than very moderate success. He had loved his father with the love of mother less sons. His father had brought him up at home, lived with him, taught him and sympathised with him, and, above all, allowed himself to be sympa thised with by him, through every part of their daily life (outside the office in Lincoln's Inn Fields, of course), over every little incident in it and hobby grown out of it, till Lawrence and he had grown mutually dependent to an extent unfortunate for both, particularly the son. His unusual bringing up and the continual com panionship of one so much older had naturally made him very different from those he met on being plunged into Cambridge, and formed in him views"], [21, "THE RAW MATERIAL 3 and habits with which they could not coincide, and at the same time a demand for sympathy of a sort they were unprepared to grant. The result had been that after making some attempts to gain their friendship by the only method he knew \u2014 namely, by pouring out his deepest sentiments on every sub ject under the sun, in the outspoken and confident manner to which he had been accustomed at home, attempts received with a want of intelligence and inability to blink the humorous easily misconstrued into want of sympathy by one who had never known what it was to be misunderstood or to feel ridiculous \u2014 Lawrence had relapsed into the opposite extreme of self-reserve upon most subjects, certainly all those dear to him ; and after his first term had been very cautious about admitting any one com pletely into his confidence. Then his father died, and he was left to self sufficiency. The generality of men found him good fellow enough, easy to get on with up to a point ; and his physical powers and striking success at most games he took up, coupled with his unconventionality,won their respect at all events. He was one of the men with many acquaintances, but few friends : still, a few. He never dreamed of complaining, or even at tributing the inevitable result of his home-training to any want of care on his father's part ; nor, on the other hand, did he put himself out to remedy it. The difference was as obvious to himself as to any one, but he looked upon it with a kind of grimly"], [22, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 4 loyal satisfaction : its advantages probably counter balanced its disadvantages, or, if they did not, he meant to imagine that they did \u2014 he was younger in some things, and older in others, than Qther men \u2014 there was a barrier between them, slight enough maybe, but he saw no cause for removing it him self or deferring to the opinions and prejudices of others, when his father had ordained matters thus. He was content to have them so, and take things as they came. In this he was not loyal to selfishness ; but he had not then learnt that even the prejudices of others cannot be disregarded with impunity. And his consequent isolation reacted upon its causes and sank him a little deeper in his own peculiar grooves; while the self-reliance, not found wanting on his father's death, developed into a needless defiance of others, which he grew over-ready to display for the mere gratification of feeling his own strength, and indulging in that spirit of antagonism to which most young men with any force of character succumb, more or less, at one time or another. As a boy he had been old for his years ; as a man he was over-boyish. The death of his father and other circumstances had arrested his development for a time. He resented new ideas. His knowledge of the world, and of women's society particularly, was extremely limited, though he had made up for that to a great extent by read ing everything he could lay hands upon. But, after all, there is no substitute for actual experience (as has indeed been obvious to many), and the very"], [23, "THE RAW MATERIAL 5 wideness and indiscriminate nature of his reading had rendered his views on most subjects formless and indefinite as yet. The poets, old and new, for their beauty and passion, rather than their teaching, formed his chiefest delight ; and his unabashed dis play of that same had caused as much amusement among his acquaintances in early Cambridge days as might have been expected. It amused him, too, to look back upon, though he hardly knew why. In fact, I have already said he was something of a dreamer \u2014 he would have said thinker, of course \u2014 and the indefinite nature of his thinking was especi ally apparent in his religion. He was not a religious man, not wholly irreligious either ; but his antipathy to all form and convention had driven him into that formless religion which is practically an indolent sort of agnosticism, common to many young men, delight in youth and health and beauty, with a resolve to get as much into his own life as possible, and with a wild thankfulness to some great unapproachable power for it all ; while content to let the revelation of that power come to him as might or might not be, but with no actual seeking after it of himself. \" Six hours in sleep ; in law's grave study six ; Four hours to prayer ; the rest on nature fix.\" So wrote Sir Edward Coke, or rather so some body rendered Sir Edward Coke's quotation. Then came another and wrote : \" Seven hours to law, to soothing slumber seven, Ten to the world allot, and all to heaven.\""], [24, "6 LAWRENCE WESTERTON An amendment Lawrence cordially approved (spite of the extra hour's law) without hesitating to con sider whether, as he was not a Sir William Jones, it might not be better to adopt the method which at all events was the more likely to prevent none being given to God at all. His father and he had been used to take long country rambles together, with knapsacks on their backs and sketch-books in their pockets ; and Lawrence looked back upon those expeditions as the most sacred part of his life. Since his father's death he had continued them alone, for no one could be admitted to his father's place there, cer tainly. They gave him intense enjoyment, for he could dream the whole day long, with the face of Nature alternately frowning and smiling upon him, but always inspiring him with the sense of some new majesty or beauty ; while it was never frivolous, as the face of his brother-men (those he knew) seemed over-prone to be. His religion was wrapped up in them, and they were his services. Now I said or implied that Lawrence was possessed of physical powers, and I suppose I ought to pull him to pieces in the usual way. He was about medium height, and of no very handsome or striking appearance, though the set of his head on a pair of wonderful shoulders was cer tainly worth looking at. He had a remarkably good constitution, and that combination of strength and activity which denies a man a first place in putting the weight or running a hundred yards, and yet fits him for general purposes better than the"], [25, "THE RAW MATERIAL 7 singular ability to do either. He was a good all round man, and looked it. His eyes were deep-set and dark grey, and had a habit of neglecting to focus you. His brown hair was curly, his r.ose enough the reverse to escape cavil, or a dissertation of more than six chapters (though I am not confident) from the pen of the student of Slawkenbergius, supposing him alive and interested. His mouth, visible out of deference to his pro fession, was smallish, and \u2014 well you could not call it weak now \u2014 it was naturally weak, but the last few years had tightened it, and lined the corners of it. If you could have seen it my attempts at describing his character would have been unneces sary. Those lines told a very great deal. His one particular beauty, from a feminine point of view, was the dimple in his chin ; and his chin itself was prominent, and saved the firmness of his mouth from appearing mere obstinacy. His general expression was of a self possession that had been cultivated, and was perhaps inclined to overdo itself in its endeavours not to be upset. His reserve, however, was suddenly thrown off sometimes in a most unexpected manner. He had come to the conclusion to keep his better side to himself, but out of regard for truth and a desire not to seem better than he was, together with a reckless contempt for the opinions of most people, he never hesitated at revealing the other side of his character : which resulted in his being"], [26, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 8 generally considered morally worse than he was, considerably. As was natural to a young man of unsettled opinions, left to stand alone suddenly in the world, with seemingly boundless health and capacity for enjoyment \u2014 money too not a little \u2014 its pleasures had proved exceedingly attractive ; and his Cambridge life had been disfigured by two or three infatuations, which he as yet hardly knew whether he regretted or not, but which he was at the time certainly too proud to attempt concealing. His reading saved him from becoming a sensualist, as it did afterwards from becoming a cynic, for it had awakened in him an intense chivalry for all women (inter alia) ; his inexperience, however, at the outset had allowed him to give his devotion to unworthy objects, youth and ardour of sentiment had allowed him to take what they offered, what many of the men he admired had taken, and more condoned the taking of. His books had taught him of the sacredness of woman's mission and its possibilities for him ; but he was content to wait for that, for a time at least, not recognising the fact that revelation in regard to most things comes to him who fits himself to receive it. And till then these women he knew \u2014 well, they were pleasant enough accessories to his life, accessories rather apt to become necessaries ; but that he forgot. His acquaintances who found him good company for themselves, were, however, rather chary of introducing to their families a man whose openness"], [27, "THE RAW MATERIAL 9 upon the very subjects most men display a certain amount of reticence about, appeared to them to proceed either from ignorance of the usual restraints regarding them, or mere bravado. They were inclined to think the latter. But in either case he was undesirable from a social point of view ; they were unwilling to trust him ; they could not under stand him. And all the evidence they had was damaging. So it came about that there was no admission for Lawrence into good society, through them at least ; a result he took in his philosophic way, slightly contemptuous, when he realised its cause, that men who were privately no better than he, or maybe worse, should regard him as less trust worthy for not being something of the hypocrite also. So he lived his own life at Cambridge, and in process of time was called to the Bar, and devoted himself to the law-books with the loyal energy his father's memory inspired. It was wearisome enough to be sure, and after a time his solitariness began to tell upon him ; and after a little longer time the shadow of a dread to creep over him, though he loathed himself for it, a dread that his father's memory would never, as he had imagined, be sufficient to make his life's work acceptable to him, or bind him worthily to it. He had read about duty for duty's sake being its own reward, and that sort of thing, till he was sick of it; and found also that he could work well enough if he chose."], [28, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 10 He worked accordingly as well as he could, for duty's sake. The satisfaction derivable, however, he considered uncommonly disproportionate ; and as his heart went out of it the temptations around him began to take firmer hold upon him. There was nothing to keep him to it but a memory. And he realised the peril of income. A purposelessness seemed to be settling down upon his life, and he had no notion as to what he wanted to better it. He would have a spell of self-reproach, then another of steady grinding, then of discontent, and so round and on again ; the pur poselessness by recurrence becoming more impressed upon him as time went on. He was having a very bad fit of it one morning in May (after a fortnight's uninterrupted study and worry over a certain abstract of title, which he had at length advised upon to his own satisfaction) as he sat in his chambers, that indefinite quantity signifying equally a fraction of an attic and a whole ground floor, with the clerk, of whom he enjoyed one undivided fifth, reading the newspaper the other side the wall. He wanted a holiday, he said to himself, as I am afraid he had got into the habit of saying rather oftener than a medical adviser would have thought justifiable. That was settled at once, with a fine disregard of the boundaries of the law sittings ; for Whitsuntide was not due for another week or so. The thing to do with these fits was to just ignore them, put them down to liver, &c, and make a bolt."], [29, "THE RAW MATERIAL 11 Query : Where to go ? He spread out a map of England, covered as to the home counties with fine red lines, representing the tracks of former rambles ; and contemplated it attentively. The home counties for once did not seem attractive. His eye travelled westwards ; he had been read ing Kingsley's life lately, and he thought of the West and Kingsley's tears. Why not go westward ? Have a complete change ? He had never been farther west than Oxford, for his father's business had kept them within easy reach of town, and the old roads were the dearest after his loss. Westward and Kingsley recalled, amongst other places, Holne and Dartmoor, and Dartmoor recalled Arthur Trepinnock \u2014 Arthur Trepinnock, who had been one of his few friends at Cambridge, and was dead. He was a year younger than Lawrence ; of the dare-devil sort, perhaps from too much hunting over the granite boulders of his home ; and they had been mutually attracted by similarity of dis position. For Arthur had all Lawrence's reckless independence \u2014 though without the accompanying qualifications \u2014 and a trifle more too. Lawrence, by virtue of the authority derived from his being twelve months older, and the mag nificent experience a whole year at Cambridge had given him \u2014 him of all men \u2014 had undertaken to guide this wild spirit in accordance with all the"], [30, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 12 precedents gatherable from authors old and new ; with the result that he had been trusted, then laughed at, then sworn at and trusted again, as the queerest of all advisers ever heard of, and his advice followed or not, as the case might be, according to circumstances and Arthur's temper at the time. Arthur had all the passions of the ordinary human being, with money enough to stimulate them, and little control \u2014 none to speak of except Lawrence's, at what that was worth \u2014 passions for horses and all the poor beasts have brought with them, for wine or its modern substitutes, and the rest. And the last had killed him. Lawrence felt partly responsible, owing to the position he had taken and had only abandoned when Arthur was sent down, and so passed out of his reach. But he might as well have tried to show Jack Mytton the way he should go ; which was a comfort of a sombre kind when realised. After that Arthur went abroad, and rapidly and unutter ably to the bad altogether ; and after six months of it had finished his career with a Colt at Monte Carlo, the finale being attended with the usual amount of mystery, which is no mystery after all ; except for the reasons which render Delilah, or the origin of evil, for ever unaccountable. Arthur had lost his mother early, like Lawrence, which might account for much ; but his father was still alive. Lawrence's thoughts passed on now to the remembrance of the hearty middle-aged gentle man whom he had once seen at Cambridge before this catastrophe, and who had taken a fancy to him"], [31, "THE RAW MATERIAL 13 as he did to all who interested themselves in his scamp of a son, making him promise, then and there, to go and see what Dartmoor and the fishing was like some day. He had never fulfilled that promise yet, though he had always wished to see his friend's home; for he had hardly liked to run the risk of renewing the man's sorrow for his son by awakening the memories his presence would suggest. But he must have got over it by this time \u2014 it was all long enough ago now, Lawrence thought. And he did not intend to ask for hospitality or intrude in any way ; but he could not go without a word to the Squire either. He wrote a letter accordingly to Robert Trepin nock, Esq., J. P., and another one, with less difficulty, to the inn the guide-book recommended him to put up at, and went out to post them himself, for want of occupation. After that he studied the guide-book for a time ; settling down again to more law-books was out of the question. A restlessness had seized him. He considered whether he should not go back to his lodgings and begin looking his things together : but that would not fill up two whole days. Besides David was there to see after them. Should he go to the tackle-maker's and buy some flies ? No, he would go and call on Violet Vane. Under all the circumstances I may as well intro duce Violet Vane to you at once ; an introduction for which I apologise. But she is a necessary part of my story, and if you are in doubt as to the"], [32, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 14 desirability of going any further, I would, with deference, recall to your notice the name on the title-page, for reassurance. Violet Vane was very beautiful \u2014 there could be no doubt at all as to that \u2014 with the beauty of hothouse flowers, and the artificiality of culture and climate they suggest ; gracefully moulded, and delicately tinted, and as wondrously fashioned altogether, from the crown of her curl-covered head down to the arch of her dainty foot as \u2014 such women are : God help them, and us. When her brown eyes had met Lawrence's six months ago, at an indiscriminate gathering, they had burnt into him in a moment and lighted a flame which had continued to fire him steadily ever since. Did Lawrence love her ? He would have said so. But Pelleas thought he loved Ettarre for a time. Well, you have pitied Pelleas, as who has not ? You need not pity Lawrence, or I should not have been writing this. And your scorn of him on this lady's account I must ignore ; for no human being can hope to escape scorn altogether, or perhaps is worthy to do so. Besides, he is my hero. I must leave him to take his chance with you without further argument. Did Violet Vane love Lawrence ? That is a far more difficult question, demanding insight into character and a large heart. I do not know whether she was capable of loving any one ; but she was capable of a good many things. She could reverence Lawrence for the reverence he displayed"], [33, "THE RAW MATERIAL 15 towards her, and appreciate his motives for it ; which is not a little either. Like the rest, she had not understood him at all at first, this man with a courteousness on his lips that his eyes did not belie, who treated her with an attention and chivalrous consideration her experi ence of mankind in general had so far rendered her incredulous about, at least for herself. But then Lawrence had read a great deal and seen little of the world comparatively ; which has its own advan tages in some respects too : in rendering contempt for any sort of woman impossible, for instance, and brutality, even of the \"refined\" order, detestable. He was not rich enough to make his admiration acceptable merely .on that account. To do her justice, Violet considered him, nevertheless, well worth the keeping, by all the arts she was mistress of. Nor were they few ; for she was by no means unaccomplished, ill-educated, and had quite enough tact and wit into the bargain to render her attractive and fascinating in more ways than one. No better than she should be ? Who is ? Or as good ? Unfortunately, nets are none the less nets for being of the finest and most delicate ; they are all adapted for catching, and the material depends upon the game to be caught, and on that alone which was one of the things she understood very well indeed. When Lawrence came to see her that afternoon she saw he looked tired and wanted attention and"], [34, "16 LAWRENCE WESTERTON comforting. So she gave him the daintiest of hands, which he straightway kissed, a stool at her feet to sit upon, the fold of her skirt across his knee to indicate her good favour, a cigarette to aid conversation or silence alternatively ; and ordered in coffee as something to look forward too. She appreciated the demands of romance. Then she waited for the general atmosphere to tell upon him and make him expand. Lawrence grew contented, and expanded accord ingly into the compliments her beauty and kindness excited, which set her smiling with graciousness and condescension ; then into general conversation and good humour, which she stimulated after the pretty method she could always rely upon for effect, until the charmingest coffee set imaginable was brought in, to give her something to pretend to busy herself over and make her look more beautiful than ever. Lawrence sipped his coffee and flowed on into all sorts of topics for an hour or more. At length he confessed that he was going to leave London and consequently the pleasure of her society for a time, &c. &c. ; upon which she grew inquisitive to learn what could be taking him away in May, and whither he was going ; and when he told her, wished him joy of the mists and bleak ness and his own society in so pointed a manner that of course he could not help asking her to come and pay him a visit there ; a request she, also of course, had to refuse at first, to turn it into a prayer ; and at last consented graciously to accede"], [35, "THE RAW MATERIAL \u25a07 to it perhaps, for a day. For she saw that he wanted to be alone, or guessed as much from her knowledge of his peculiarities ; and was too wise to give admirers the chance of tiring of her com pany. But she gave him a rose to keep until their next meeting, and kissed it for him first for supplement ary comfort ; and so sent him away, in the con dition the dietetics recommend as the best in which to have done dinner ; that is, with a desire that there should have been just a trifle more of it. The next day but one brought Lawrence his letters ; one from the inn to say that the best chamber was preparing, an unexpected compliment too early qualified by the remark that there would be no other visitors staying there ; the other from Mr. Trepinnock, of the hearty kind Lawrence had expected : why had he never been before ? The moor was at its best : of course he might fish the whole river length : \"you must give us an evening, and tell us all you remember about the poor dear lad.\" Who were \"us?\" thought Lawrence, till he read on to \" Doris will be so delighted to see one who appreciated her brother as you did ; \" and then he remembered Arthur's some times talking of a \"little sister,\" an expression conveying about as much information, as to size and age, as \"old boy\" does in a young man's mouth. And so it came about that Lawrence went down to Dartmoor, where you will find him in the next B"], [36, "18 LAWRENCE WESTERTON chapter, with Violet behind and Arthur's \"little sister\" before. Perhaps that is rather too explicit a statement. But this is not a story of surprises. I would have the general drift of it evident from the first."], [37, "CHAPTER II DORIS TREPINNOCK COMES ACROSS A VIPER If you have never visited Dartmoor, by all means make a resolution to do so some day or other ; and then \u2014 do not abandon it. By which recommendation I would imply that Dartmoor is considerably worth seeing ; yes, and worth hearing, and smelling, and tasting too ; but, above all, breathing. And I am not building hotels there, either, and hope it will be long before any one does. Bleak and desolate, and cotton-grassy, and boul- dery, and misty, and monotonous, and generally forbidding it may look at first sight, and cold it is at times ; but there is no real desolation for you except that of the ' divine despair ' after all ; and if you dislike the feeling you must make but a poor shift for it every autumn anywhere, except, I will allow, in Brighton, or similar places, where they make you cheerful by main force, after a fashion. Moreover you can always go and contemplate the convict establishment ; which seems to have been placed there by the happiest of inspirations (only inspiration had nothing to do with it) to"], [38, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 20 supply material for the comparison of sewers with mountain brooks, and a variety of other considera tions besides of a somewhat similar character. The guide-books' \"desolation \" and \" sternness \" will have undergone something like a transformation by the time you turn away. And then I can wish you no better luck than to have a keen north wind to walk home in, to tingle and be thankful. But Lawrence's impressions were never doubtful. After the first few miles of up-hill drive, when the moor began to open out before him, and the air to tell upon him, he felt that it was the very place of all others he had been inwardly longing to find all his life, and reflected on his own stupidity in not having taken measures to do so before. His eyes wandered from the quaint craggy tors across the long slopes, from the summits of which they break, down to the oak woods below, just bursting into their bright spring yellow, with the streams foaming along under their branches among the tall shoots of the bracken ; then up again to the tors and the clouds above, which seemed to be chasing each other and flinging their shadows before them over the boulder-strewn grass in a wild anxiety not to be left behind by the south-westerly gale, that had been blowing all day and bringing the water down, the driver said, as it had not come down since Easter. It was all just splendid, he thought, and wished the hardy-looking little man anywhere else but in the trap beside him, so that he could have stood up and shouted himself hoarse out of pure delight. A shower or two came along to drench them on"], [39, "DORIS TREPINNOCK COMES ACROSS A VIPER 21 the way; but Lawrence liked that too. For driving up into Dartmoor is not all driving either, in the ordinary sense of the term, and he wanted cooling. The driver seemed to think nothing of them, so why should he ? Then he listened to wonderful accounts of the fabulous dozens of trout to be caught after such a rain, and grew boyishly absorbed in the man's tales of the otters and otter-traps (alas !) and the ill-feeling engendered by the latter \u2014 of the occasional salmon \u2014 of the bogs and lost cattle, and the hunting men from town, who possessed such a fearful facility for getting engulfed \u2014 how he, the driver, and most of the male population for any number of miles round had spent a day and a half rescuing one poor horse this very spring \u2014 and how, when they did get it out at last, it had been ungrate ful enough to consider Mr. Trepinnock's kennels the most suitable place for itself after all \u2014 then of the shooting in winter-time \u2014 how a certain Mr. John Gortinglass, of local celebrity, had killed n couple of snipe in one morning to his own gun, and two winters ago had even shot a wild-goose up there by the bog below Oxtor \u2014 which same wild-goose had been subsequently stuffed at considerable expense, and now stood in the hall of the Three Foxes and a glass case, resplendent \u2014 how the duck came over in countless swarms, and the woodcock down in Squire Ogle's preserves might not be numbered for multitude, any more than mites in a cheese, &c, &c. ; all related with ever-increasing volubility and a mastery over circumstantial detail that excited Lawrence's professional admiration \u2014 until the Three"], [40, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 22 Foxes suddenly broke upon their view at the bottom of a sharp descent, and horse and man pulled up together directly afterwards. Despite the pictorial absurdity of three wolfish looking monsters, represented with remarkable vividness of colour and symmetry of design, together with such exaggeration of tail and white tuft there on as had at once precluded the necessity for deference to nature in any other respect, which hung over the door, the inn looked pretty enough, nestling among the oaks, with a larch or two and a clump of firs to protect them up above, and a two spanned ivy-clad bridge crossing the river before it. Lawrence was delighted with it outside and in ; and when he had eaten his dinner, and appreciated it in a manner that at once put him upon good terms with Mrs. Baker, the landlady, and had stood for a while afterwards leaning against the bridge, watch ing the stream bustling along below and the sun setting with the promise of a glorious morrow after the storm, he began to find a new flavour in his pipe and to think that life would certainly be worth living on Dartmoor, for a time at all events. He congratulated himself on recognising the necessity for a holiday, and hitting upon a spot that seemed so perfectly adapted for his thorough enjoyment of it ; and then, as there was nothing much else to be done, he went to bed, resolving to do great things in the fishing way next day. The sun did not belie his promise. The next day was all that could be desired from most points of view, though not exactly from an angler's : there"], [41, "DORIS TREPINNOCK COMES ACROSS A VIPER 23 was hardly a cloud. But the wind was blowing fresh, and the water had fined down to that thin portery colour so dear to the angler's heart ; so there was not much to complain of. Lawrence got through his breakfast, swearing, as Londoners will swear (they still have a good deal of sense), that Devonshire cream is worth going 200 miles, if not more, to eat ; and then set off, intending to walk up the river till it took a turn which would give him the wind over his left shoulder, fishing up stream ; that being the best possible direction, he held, for it to blow from to take a line well out. And after he had walked on through a meadow or two, and so out on to the open moor, he could restrain himself no longer \u2014 the sense of space and freedom and the gracious grandeur of earth trans ported him \u2014 but burst into singing those noble words set to as noble music : \" Praised be the fathomless universe, for life and joy and for objects and knowledge marvellous \" : and sang them again and again, for he could think of none else to sing so entirely in harmony with his own state of mind and the beauty of all around him. Ecstasy may seem ridiculous to the prosaic, but gratitude for youth and health and pure air would be very inade quately expressed without it. The thrush would not have burst a blood-vessel, singing, if it had pos sessed enough intelligence to be prosaic. It had to sing, and Lawrence felt much in the same way. The trout were rising, and the blue uprights were dancing as if they had not a moment to lose, as perhaps they had not, and Lawrence set to"], [42, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 24 work. After half a dozen throws he got his hand in, and hooked his first fish in the swirl behind a stone. Oh ! that first fish of one's angling holiday ! Whatever its size, is there another like it ? It was no bigger than the average Dartmoor trout \u2014 they are not enormous \u2014 but it was quickly followed by more, as he went on up stream, through marsh and grass and occasional heather, the river now sliding down over the gravel in long stretches, calm and business-like, now pouring through the rocks and boulders in whirling rapids and foaming torrents with a clamour that made his ears throb and tingle to hear, and here and there dancing out among the slippery moss-grown stones into a hundred eddying pools, where the trout lay and sucked down the flies by the score, and never could have enough ; \u2014 until by two o'clock he had landed close upon three dozen. A bend in the river then brought him to a stand still, for the wind, though soft enough by this time, came right down it ; and another thing that made him pause was the knowledge that he was beginning to feel most fearfully hot and hungry, and had brought nothing with him but a large flask of whisky. He had come up three miles or more from the inn, and could not think of wasting time by going back there for lunch. Besides, there lay the trout in his basket, and the notion that occurred to him of trying his hand at cooking them rather took his fancy. There was plenty of refuse brought down by the flood, which might very well do for a fire. He"], [43, "DORIS TREPINNOCK COMES ACROSS A VIPER 25 collected a bundle and piled it up under a granite wall that came down to the river close by. But it was still too wet, and seemed to want some arrange ment to hold it up in the middle and keep the draught going. It would not burn up, though he blew at it until the specks danced in his eyes. He began to get savage and hungrier still. Some peat stacks a couple of hundred yards or more across the river caught his eye as he looked about for something better ; so he waded through and brought back as much of the driest as he could carry, and propped it round a piece of bent iron that had fallen out of some broken fencing on the wall ; and at last, after wasting half his matches and losing the remains of his temper, succeeded in setting a furious blaze going. Then came the unpleasant process of removing the trouts' \" innards\" ; but he had grown too ravenous to be squeamish, or to consider the mouthfuls of half-charred and half-raw fish that came off the sticks he toasted them on anything but the most satisfactorily cooked eating he had ever tasted. His bad temper subsided under the influence of his primitive meal and the subsequent whisky and pipe, and, after sitting for a while in a state of pacific contemplation, he was just beginning to think of making a fresh start, although the sun was most fearfully hot and the wind had gone down altogether, when his ear suddenly caught the sound, the unmistakable sound, of a rod swishing about up above him. His temper rose again, and he sat still under the"], [44, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 26 wall, waiting. \" Some cursed idiot fishing down,\" he muttered to himself, \"spoiling the water for my afternoon.\" The swishing sound came steadily nearer, and at last Lawrence popped his head up over the wall with a scowl, and saw the \" cursed idiot\" ; and his scowl went out like the flame of a candle in the experiment with the jar of carbonic acid gas ; for the \"cursed idiot\" was the most beautiful being he had ever seen in his life. Lawrence gaped with astonishment. There, fifteen or twenty yards up stream, stood a girl with light reddish hair, and a face like the heaven above him for light and beauty, glowing with the health of the moor and the Devonshire sun. She held a rod in her hand, and her great eyes were fixed upon the middle of the pool, where a fish had just risen ; and as he gazed she threw her line out in the neatest and most business-like way just over the place, and her body swayed slightly and steadied itself as she did so too grace fully for words to describe. But what attracted his attention particularly was the fact that, in open defiance of all the laws and regulations of the conservators for the districts of Somerset and Devon, she had caught up her plain blue serge skirt round her waist, and was wading, actually wading, almost up to her knees and the limit allowed by a short striped petticoat, in the water, five yards or so from the bank, with her shoes and stockings dangling round her neck. Lawrence continued to gape, as she drew back"], [45, "DORIS TREPINNOCK COMES ACROSS A VIPER 27 her line and moved a step or two downwards for another throw ; when the smell of his fire must have attracted her attention, or the intuitive feeling of being watched prompted her to see whence, for she suddenly looked up and spied him and his astonishment. With a natural confusion she hesitated a moment, and then stepped out as if to cross the pool. But the rising water soon told her that she must either get thoroughly wet, or lift up her skirt still higher ; neither of which alternatives seemed an entirely acceptable way out of the difficulty. She hesitated again, while a little frown gathered on her brow at herself for her confusion, or at him for causing it. There were three other courses open to her. First to come on straight down and pass him in the water. But water up to our knees and with a gravelly bottom is difficult to move in, even under ordinary circumstances. So that did not commend itself. Secondly, she might go back the way she had come, a retreat involving loss of dignity. Thirdly, she might walk straight out of the water to the bank nearest her, get over the wall, and pass Lawrence by land. And as this was obviously the best of the three she turned to adopt it, and Law rence forgot all his manners and continued to gaze with undisguised admiration in the rudest possible way. She reached the bank and stepped up into the grass, and, as was pardonably natural perhaps, Lawrence's eyes travelled down to her ankles, which were certainly worth looking at too ; but his"], [46, "28 LAWRENCE WESTERTON expression of admiration changed suddenly to one of horror, for she had not taken two steps forward before he saw a little thick dark line take a half coil round her foot, give a savage dab with one end of itself, uncoil and disappear. With a startled cry she sprang aside, tripped and tumbled on to the grass. Lawrence was on his feet the same instant. All sorts of surgical notions flashed through his brain, as he felt in his pocket for a knife, or matches, or something. Better than all these just before his eyes sat his lucky bit of bent iron fencing, red-hot, with the great pile of peat still glowing fiercely round it. He caught it up with his handkerchief in one hand, vaulted the wall by the other, and dashed towards her. \" Can you bear pain ? \" he cried. She lifted her head defiantly with a flash of scorn at his question, or anger at him for her new mishap, and stretched out her right foot, with the tiny marks of the viper's fangs just on the side of the instep. He knelt down beside her. \" You'd better hang on to something tight,\" he said. But as there was nothing but himself to hang on to the advice was disregarded. Now Lawrence was totally ignorant of the prac tice of surgery in general, or \" actual \" cautery in particular, but he held her foot firmly grasped in one hand and a red-hot iron in the other, while no time was to be lost in combining them if the"], [47, "DORIS TREPINNOCK COMES ACROSS A VIPER 29 operation was to be effective ; so he pressed the iron on to the tiny wounds, and watched the result for a moment. \" I should think that ought to do,\" he said, and looked up to her face ; and gaped with astonish ment again. She had not uttered a cry, but sat there, rather pale, with her lips drawn tightly across her teeth and her eyebrows puckered together, while her eyes were wide open and fixed upon him with an expression so like fierceness that it almost took his breath away. \" I hope I haven't hurt you too much,\" he stam mered in dismay. \" Something had to be done at once, and I'm sorry if I was wrong.\" And he looked down at the wound he had made, feeling tolerably sheepish as the inadequacy or inappro priateness of his apology struck him. \" Will you have some whisky ? \" he added, after a moment. \" Perhaps I had better,\" she said, in a tone that startled him again, for it had not a quaver in it. He took a little water from the river, and filled up the cup of his flask with whisky in proportions which would have won the approval of Mynheer Vandunck, and she swallowed it all without winking. Her coolness began to be embarrassing. He watched her bind up her foot in her handkerchief, afraid to intrude any further assistance, and feeling rather unnecessary than otherwise. Rescue loses all its splendour when the rescued takes matters too calmly. Lawrence thought he had perhaps been somewhat precipitate, as he stood with the"], [48, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 30 whisky in one hand and the cup in the other, wonder ing in an awe-struck kind of way what on earth he had better do next. Then she began to put her stockings on with so perfect a disregard of his presence or confidence in his good manners that he hardly knew whether to feel crushed into nothingness or swollen with pride in consequence ; anyhow, he left off watching instantly. But when it came to her shoes, and she had put the left one on, she paused, and looking up at him as he stood in assumed obliviousness of everything but a most uninteresting peat-stack the other side of the river, said, with just a shade of doubt and perplexity in her voice : \" I can't put it on. And if I could, I don't think I could walk ; \" and paused again. Lawrence turned to find her taking a critical survey of no less a person than himself: which did not tend to lessen his awkwardness. How much might he offer without offending her ? She evidently expected an offer of some sort. He tried to pull himself together, and put the cup on to the bottom of the whisky flask, to gain time, as a preliminary ; when she came to his relief. \" You must carry me,\" she said, quite simply ; \" and you look as if you could. The road runs along the top of the hill here, and our groom was to meet me with the dog-cart. Or perhaps you had better go up first and see if he is about, and bring him down to help you.\" The last part of her speech was just a little too much for Lawrence's pride to stand. It stung him"], [49, "DORIS TREPINNOCK COMES ACROSS A VIPER 31 into self-possession at once. Besides, he was not going to leave her to faint or do anything of that sort with no one by. He put her other shoe into his pocket, and laid her rod and basket beside his own. \" I can send them to you some time,\" he said, \" if you don't live far from here ; they're awkward to carry.\" \" Not far,\" she answered. \" I am Doris Trepin nock.\" He had guessed as much. \" And my name's Westerton,\" he replied ; and noticed a look of recog nition and something like satisfaction come into her face ; which made him confident enough to proffer more whisky. \" You can't drink too much after snake-bites, I've read,\" he said. So she drank again, and then stood up, and had to catch at him quickly to prevent her self falling. And at that small weakness her forti tude yielded at last. With a little gulp she gave in and burst into tears. Lawrence took her up, one arm round her shoulders and the other under her knees, as gently as he could. But he could not have spoken a word if he had tried. A girl in tears was beyond his powers of comfort in that sort of way altogether. Perhaps what he did was the very best thing to do after all, for the feeling of a man's arms raising her and the sense of protection that brought was comfort worth all the words in the world. Off he set through the bog that bordered the stream straight towards the hill, and then up"], [50, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 32 through the grass, tripping and stumbling over the stones which his burden prevented him seeing, with never a thought of anything but getting to the top as fast as he could. But carrying nine stone even of incarnate beauty, and that in distress too, up a hundred feet rising one in three, through grass and gorse and heather mixed up with loose granite of various sizes but unvarying sharpness, with a broiling sun beating down all the while and never a breath of wind to temper it, is no light job for any man. And so Lawrence found. After the first two minutes of it he began to have serious misgivings. Then she fainted right off, whether from the effect of viper's bite or the wound he had made, or the heat, or the whisky, or general collapse. That had its advan tages, however, for he could shift her position into one rather better adapted for transport \u2014 of a mechanical kind. He rested for a spell, panting and perspiring, and then took to it again with his teeth set hard and every muscle taut for the strain. Those hundred feet seemed thousands ; and if ever he thanked heaven for his strength he did so when at last he caught sight of the wall, which bounded the road, just above him, and reeled up to it gasp ing. He was fairly done, and had to put her down at the foot of it before he could get on to the top to see if the groom was in sight. There, sure enough, some two hundred yards along the road, sat a man in a gay little dog-cart, with his back turned towards him, lazily flicking the flies off his horse, as if there were no vipers or"], [51, "DORIS TREPINNOCK COMES ACROSS A VIPER 33 Doris Trepinnocks or Lawrence Westertons in the world. Lawrence roused his damaged forces to make known that there was still something left of the last worth considering, and his shouts brought the man round and dashing towards him at a pace which threatened to shake every screw out of the little dog-cart in no time. By the time he had come up Lawrence had lifted Doris up on to the wall with a last effort, and then fallen over after her himself somehow ; and lay where he had fallen, thoroughly ex hausted. \" Good God ! sir,\" cried the man turning as white as his collar as he recognised his mistress and flung himself out of the cart. \" What be 'e after, sir ? Whatever's happened to her ? \" \" Viper,\" gasped Lawrence, \" down by th' river \u2014 't's all right \u2014 brought her up \u2014 she'll be round \u2014 minute \u2014 I hope.\" \" Where, sir, where ? \" asked the other, meaning the bite. Lawrence pointed to her foot, and he bent to look, his face such a picture of alarm and dismay that Lawrence felt at once that his assistance was not worth taking into account, and that he must still keep his own senses about him. \" 'Twon't kill her, will it ? \" he said, angrily ; \" besides I've caut'rised it.\" \" Noa, 't won't kill her ; but they be main bad tu sometimes, they vipers. I've known \" \"What the devil's your knowledge got to do with it now ? \" broke in Lawrence. \" Get her up c"], [52, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 34 into that cart, for God's sake, and drive her straight home. I'm done.\" But the man was so scared, and clumsy and awkward in consequence, that Lawrence had to help him after all. Between them they succeeded in hoisting her into the cart in a heap. Lawrence slipped the flask into her lap. \" Keep her going at that when she comes to,\" he said ; \" and perhaps you'd better take a drop yourself, you quaking idiot, or you'll be forgetting the road home or driving her into a ditch.\" Lawrence was past considering other people's feelings. Insult seemed to do the man good. And, moreover, Doris now showed premonitory symptoms of recovery by opening her eyes and gazing listlessly about her ; which did more. He propped her up against the seat as comfortably as possible, gathered up his reins, and with a look at Lawrence, in which fright was so absurdly blended with determination not to be overcome by it, that Lawrence could have laughed outright if he had not been so tired and angry, drove off along the road. Lawrence watched them out of sight, sighed once or twice for relief \u2014 and yet not altogether for that reason \u2014 mopped himself, clambered over the wall, and stumbled back down to the river. \" By Heaven, if I find that viper ! \" he muttered. But he never did that : indeed he never looked for it."], [53, "CHAPTER III COMPARISONS Down, down the way he had come. It had been a pull and no mistake. Lawrence wondered how he had ever done it, and turned quite giddy and sick for a moment or two. He was wet through with perspiration, and aching all over. His knees felt as if the muscles had been clean torn off them, and must double up beneath him at every step, and his arms as if the sockets had been loosened for life : as for his shins and ankles, they were as raw as if he had been playing against a northern foot ball team with no pads on, for weeks. And all to get a girl up a bit of a hill ! Well, he would do the same again, any day of the week, and count the pride of having done it reward enough too. No man can exercise his manhood after that sort without realising something more than he felt before of what that manhood comprehends. Pain and perspiration were never profitless yet ; a truism he had not fully appreciated until now. And he felt particularly grateful to Providence for putting it before him in such an unmistakeable"], [54, "36 LAWRENCE WESTERTON manner. True, he had been the primary cause of Doris' mishap. But that did not hinder his feeling a natural self-satisfaction in having risen to the occa sion and done his undeniable best in dealing with an accident he could not have prevented. He would have liked to have been quite certain that he had been quick enough, and that no evil conse quences would follow from the bite. As to the wound he had made, present inconvenience would be the only result of that \u2014 at least, so he hoped. She looked healthy enough to have stood cauter ising in half a dozen places without any danger worth considering. He had never seen a girl look so splendidly healthy. Her fainting was only natural under the circumstances \u2014 shock and reaction after bearing herself so bravely, quite natural. She would be all right in a day or two, so he argued to himself; but for all that he could not help feeling considerably more anxiety about her than reason seemed to justify. So he argued the matter all over again, with an imprecation or two on his deficiency in medical knowledge, but with much the same result. His fire had almost died out by the time he reached the river, but he kicked the remains of the peat together and sat down by it to rest and medi tate; which was foolish, considering the state he was in. But he did not consider. He kept on thinking about Doris and her accident instead. He pictured her to himself as he had first seen her, fishing in the pool just above him, then in her distress on the grass, and then as she lay fainting in his arms"], [55, "COMPARISONS 37 during that fearful pause on the hillside ; and her image seemed to grow more beautiful every minute. It had been a strange introduction to his dead friend's sister. She reminded him of Arthur not a little, as he recalled her features one by one, her tall, straight figure and the independent set of her little head, and above all that expression of fierce determination which had taken him so aback. Arthur's face had always taken that expression whenever anything had stirred him out of the common. Only he used to fall to swearing vigorously directly afterwards, which marred the awe-inspiring effect of it. She could not be more than two or three and twenty he calculated, for she was younger than Arthur, he knew; by some years he supposed. Yet it seemed marvellous that a mere girl could have shown such self-possession and fortitude as she had done. He felt the better pleased that his help should have been necessary after all ; and his admiration was but enhanced by the fact that he had felt rather afraid of her. Altogether she had made a most wonderful impression upon him, such an impression that he gave up any idea of going on fishing for that day \u2014 plea, fatigue \u2014 and thought a pipe might assist at arriving at a just estimate of it. He fumbled in his pocket ; and his hand brought out her shoe, which he had quite forgotten to put into the cart. What a little shoe it looked ! He examined it carefully all over, inside and out, and put its sole against his own for comparison's sake. It was a wide-welted shoe, with little groups"], [56, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 38 of hob-nails underneath, and an air of fitness for its particular purpose of scrambling along a river bank, and general disregard for anything else, that made it prettier than any high-heeled conventional decorativeness could possibly have done : character istic of herself, he thought as he twirled it about and held it up in various positions, studying its lines as if he was inspecting a model yacht. There were her rod and fishing-basket, too. He should have to send or take them all up to her. Delightful ! He opened her basket and counted the fish she had caught \u2014 four and a half dozen, goodish ones. He smiled as he thought of his own catch, and tried a throw or two with her rod. It was a handy little rod, yet not so very much lighter than his own, and far from resembling the things like governess-cart whips they sell in the shops. There was something novel and very attractive about these to him almost Amazonian possessions. Diana as an ideal type of womanhood had excited in him that mingled reverence and regret which one cannot but feel for any noble conception of ancient times that has lost its spell and power. He would never have dreamed of her possibility in the nine teenth century; having formed an opinion, which he could hardly have justified to himself, founded as it was on a few trifling experiences in his Cam bridge days, that those who aped her characteristic devotion to sport were necessarily the last to resemble her in other respects. Yet here had stood a Diana of the nineteenth century, weapons"], [57, "COMPARISONS 39 and all, to scatter his prejudices and disbelief at a glance, and set him reconstructing his ideas by the light that gave him. No one embraces pes simism for choice, even to be considered a man of the world. To have any delusions which tend to a lower estimate of womankind dispelled is rather a cause for gratification for the most cynical. Not that Lawrence thought much about his delusions or prejudices ; he only recognised the fact that he was all the more impressed by reason of his previous incredulity ; and his admiration was the more sincere and intense for being involuntary. He wondered what sort of maiden this might be who could combine nobility of character with an interest in fishing. They were not necessarily incompatible of course ; but the combination was a new experi ence to him, like the moor itself, and, he could not but admit at once, quite as healthy and delightful. For that nobility of character was hers was utterly unquestionable. He had seen something beyond mere beauty and fearlessness in her face, and recognised it as instinctively as every man does, perhaps the more easily for never having met it closely in actual life before ; though the heroines of his favourite novels and the ladies of the poets \u2014 above all, \" Maud \" \u2014 had often suggested it to him in a dimly idealised manner : the ennobling power of truth and purity. His knowledge of women was so small, and the women he knew were hardly of a sort to affect him with any sense of distance and dignity \u2014 as she had done. The women he knew were soft, dainty things, only fit"], [58, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 40 to be kept in glass cases at an even temperature, with nothing to do but look at their hands and hope the sun would never shine except when they had put their gloves on and their heads under a parasol ; pitiable in their vaporous serenity, and more pitiable still in their passionate gusts of anger. The women he knew ! He took the pipe out of his mouth and his eyes settled into a stony stare at the vision that floated before them, with a strange and horrible suggestiveness of gas-lamps in the sunshine, the vision of Violet Vane. Violet Vane was as unlike to Doris Trepinnock as the sickly scented air of the room he had sat in a few days ago to the south-west wind breathing over the moor before him ; and he knew which was to be desired, and why, as by a sudden revelation, at once and for ever. How could he have been so blind, so careless ? How could he have been content with such a shadow of reality as his relation with Violet Vane now seemed to him ? How could he have taken plea sure in beauty such as hers, or yielded himself to her influence, knowing, as he had known all along \u2014 yes, he had known it \u2014 that there was something higher and nobler to be found if he but chose to turn himself about to look for it ? After a while a smile stole across his face, rather a grim smile, at the thought of Violet Vane wading down a river, being bitten by a viper, and cauterised immediately afterwards. But he checked the con tempt that rose in company. It involved too much contempt for himself, and he was unaccustomed to"], [59, "COMP A RISONS 41 the feeling of that. He sat on smoking stolidly, thinking. These last thoughts had taken half the pleasure out of his day, and cast a shadow between him and the wild beauty of the scene before him. He almost felt as if something or somebody had risen to estrange him from it, and question his right to be there. He shook himself savagely. He suddenly realised that he had grown horribly cold, that he was shivering with cold, although the sun was still high in the west ; and as he got up at length the stiffness in his legs and arms made him gasp and stagger with pain. How long had he been sitting there ? Yet even the pain brought with it a sensation of wholesomeness and relief. It was evidence of his service to Doris Trepinnock. It made her real again. He went to the place where she had fallen. There lay his broken piece of bent iron fencing, cold enough now, like himself. He took it up absently; and before he realised what he was doing he suddenly kissed it on the place where it had seared her, and kissed it again. He looked round guiltily. There was no one there to mock him ; but to his fancy the moor and the river seemed to murmur reproach, as at a profanation. He paused for a moment, wondering what had become of all his light-heartedness of the morning, then hurriedly gathered the rest of his"], [60, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 42 treasures together, and set off down the valley, homewards, as quickly as he could. The trout were rising again fast, but he never heeded them ; and the peace of the long summer evening was slowly settling over all. But that only served to deepen his sense of incongruity ; for as he went the figure of Violet Vane danced before him all the way. The innkeeper stood on the bridge as he came up, leisurely smoking a long clay pipe, and occa sionally expectorating into the river below with as great care and calculation as if he had been throw ing a fly. He turned on hearing Lawrence. \"Fish sport pretty well to-day, sir?\" he inquired patronisingly. \"Thanks,\" said Lawrence indifferently, and passed him. He was in no mood for angling commonplaces. Joe \u2014 that was the only half of Mr. Baker's name the surrounding population ever troubled them selves about \u2014 looked after him as he entered the inn. Something in Lawrence's appearance attracted his attention besides the double allowance of rod and basket. He left off smoking, and stepped round briskly to the kitchen by the back way. \" Mary, my dear,\" he said to his wife, \" some trim's gone wrong with the gen'leman. You'd better be seein' to him a bit.\" Which was Joe's way of doing things, being himself of too consider able a habit of mind and body to exercise either, save in the occasional display of a latent capacity for charioteering. So Mary found opportunitj* for straying into the"], [61, "COMPARISONS 43 parlour, where Lawrence had plumped himself down and sat crouching by the fire. \" Can I do anything for you, sir ? \" she asked. \" Polly's takin' some hot water up to your room.\" \" No,\" said Lawrence ; \" but let me have some dinner as soon as possible. Is there anybody about who could take the rod and basket outside up to Mr. Trepinnock's, with my compliments, and ask how Miss Trepinnock is ? \" He had, for some reason or other, changed his mind as to taking them up himself. \" There's one of the men on the farm, sir,\" she answered, \" will be going up that way directly, back to his home. But he won't be comin' back to-night.\" \" Never mind,\" said Lawrence, \" tell him I'll be much obliged if he'll take them up.\" \" Very well, sir, \" said Mrs. Baker ; and wondered what could have happened to give her guest pos session of Miss Trepinnock's belongings, and set him inquiring after her. Lawrence did not vouch safe explanations, so there was nothing left but to leave him and see after his dinner. But when it came he seemed to have no appetite for it, and the little maid Polly was quite frightened at his looks. She ventured to ask him diffidently if he felt ill. \" No,\" he said so sharply, and her fright increased so visibly thereat, that he almost smiled in spite of himself, and blamed himself for his boorishness at the same time. \" Do I look it ? \" \" Yes, you do, a little bit, sir,\" she answered"], [62, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 44 timidly. \" Perhaps you found it rather cold towards sundown up on the moor.\" \" Yes, I did,\" said Lawrence, \" but I'm all right, thank you.\" \" Perhaps you will let us bring you something hot, sir, when you go to bed ? \" Her simple kindness quite touched him. \" Thank you very much indeed ; so you may.\" So he went to bed in half an hour, and after swallowing the very hottest and strongest glass of the far-famed Plymouth gin, &c. Mistress Mary could concoct, and tossing for awhile, fell into a deep calm sleep, which lasted for a good ten hours. That and the gin probably saved him from a bad chill, and when he awoke next morning he could only look back upon his walk home down the river as upon some nasty nightmare that had passed with the night. Beyond the pain round his shoulders, and the sores on his legs, and general stiffness all over, he was little the worse for yesterday's experiences. It was another glorious day, and as he leant over the bridge waiting for breakfast, the sun and air swept away the last remnants of his gloom. He must have overdone himself, he thought, and then sat about until he got chilled. That was the common sense view of the matter. He could almost afford to laugh at the morbid depression that had over taken him afterwards. He fell to wondering how Doris was this morning, and calculating when he should see her again. He regretted having sent her things up last night, now. Still, without that"], [63, "COMPARISONS 45 excuse for going, inquries would be only polite after what had occurred, and he had Mr. Trepinnock's invitation to call upon them, besides. But he should not like to go too soon, and felt curiously anxious about the proper interval to allow. Per haps he had better go in the afternoon. He would put off deciding until after lunch, and wait. Nor had he very long to wait ; for as he sat at breakfast in the parlour he heard a bark or two and a scurry of dogs rushing out to examine and defy some intruder. But the loud deep voice that wel comed them changed their tone to one of joyous yelping. The intruder was evidently an old friend. Lawrence got up and caught a glimpse through the window of a large broad-shouldered man, with a wide-brimmed hat on the back of his head, clad in an old grey shooting-coat with the pockets bulging out all round him, corduroy breeches and leather gaiters, terminating below in a pair of heavy boots, whose scrunching proclaimed whole regi ments of nails underneath. Then followed a rap at the front door, which brought Polly flying from the back settlements. The deep voice gave her a cheery \"good morning,\" and asked if Mr. Westerton was up and about. Her answer was too low and timid for Lawrence to hear, but the drift of it was evident, for she knocked at his door and opened it. There stood the big man with his hat off, beaming all over his clean-shaven weather-worn face ; and Lawrence recognised him at once : Mr. Trepinnock."], [64, "CHAPTER IV THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME \" Sorry to disturb your breakfast, Westerton,\" said the Squire, hesitating a minute in the doorway. \" If I may, I'll just come in and take a seat while you finish.\" And he stretched forth a great brown hand and shook Lawrence's heartily. \" I was coming by this way and thought I might as well drop in.\" \" Very kind of you indeed, Mr. Trepinnock,\" said Lawrence ; \" please come in and sit down. I'm afraid I'm rather late.\" The Squire had evi dently been up some time, and an apology seemed necessary. He turned round the biggest armchair, and Mr. Trepinnock sat down solidly ; while a couple of wire-haired terriers, that had followed him in and already made a superficial examination of Lawrence's legs, instantly jumped on to their master's knees and fought for possession. \" Down, then, down with 'e, ye little brutes,\" said Mr. Trepinnock, and threw them off ; whereupon they subsided under the furniture. \"You're looking pretty well,\" he said deliber ately, after a short survey of Lawrence over his"], [65, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 47 locked hands ; \" grown quite professional since I saw you last. You won't think me too personal though,\" he added good-humouredly. But his remark had so little of the patronising in it that Lawrence would have been easily offended if he had done so. Besides, Lawrence was thinking of anything but his looks or profession or their corre spondence. He was wondering how soon he could ask Mr. Trepinnock how Doris was without appear ing over-anxious to know, and was also a bit con cerned to see in what light Mr. Trepinnock regarded the episode with the iron bar. But he was soon set at ease. The Squire seemed to divine his thoughts partly, for his eyes twinkled and his lips parted into a droll quiet smile as he said : \"You've just murdered my poor little daughter. But don't let that take your appetite away though,\" he went on. \" If you've no objection, I'll light a pipe while you go on.\" And he fumbled in his bulgy pockets, and after a prolonged search and the discovery of all sorts of treasures, includ ing an old fly-book, several twists of string, two ferret-muzzles, and a dozen or more loose cartridges (\" rooks last Saturday,\" he remarked in explanation), brought out an enormous briar-root pipe, black with age, and with half the bowl knocked away on one side \u2014 the cause of which disfigurement he pro ceeded to demonstrate by banging it against the toe of his boot to rap the remains of the last pipe ful into the fender \u2014 and proceeded to refill it out of a velvet-covered pouch daintily worked over with"], [66, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 48 gold silk. Lawrence looked at the pouch as he handed the Squire some matches, and guessed at once who had added the gold silk. \" Lovely mornin',\" remarked Mr. Trepinnock pre sently, after lighting his pipe and settling himself back in his chair, whence he regarded Lawrence with a look of decided approval. \" Tell me what took you to branding my little girl like one of these here ponies.\" And his eyes twinkled again, though whether on account of the smoke or amusement was not altogether apparent. \" I'm most awfully sorry if I've hurt her badly,\" blurted out Lawrence. \" I happened to have something hot handy ; you see I'd been cooking some of the trout I'd caught, as I hadn't any lunch with me. I hadn't time to think much, but a burn seemed preferable to poisoning.\" \" So it is, so it is,\" said Mr. Trepinnock ; \" and if it will case your mind I can tell you that she'd no bad effects from the bite. But the burn will keep her lyin' up some days,\" he added mis chievously, \" and I don't know which is the worst. We don't think very much of vipers' bites down here, specially in May. Why I've often had three or four hounds bitten in one day, otter-hunting. They just come to my heels and swell up a bit, and look sleepy-like. But they're all right in a day or two. Rather an awkward place to be bitten in, though. Serves her right for breaking the bye-laws, of course \" ; and he chuckled. \" But I daresay you did the best thing after all, and I'm certain sure you meant to, anyway ;"], [67, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 49 and thank you very much for lookin' after her sa kindly.\" \" But that's not what I came for,\" he went on. \" Yes it was though \u2014 partly, I mean ; I shouldn't have said that, should I ? I was going down to Farmer Buckle's below here to look at a pair of ponies, and so I came in to see if you'd come down with me ; that is, s'posin' you've nothing partic'lar on hand. We can walk back by the hills home to lunch, and then you can see the lady herself. She'll be around somewhere, I expect, and '11 thank you better than I can.\" He took a long pull at his pipe. \" I shall be delighted,\" said Lawrence in as con ventional a tone as he could command. He looked under the table to see what the terriers were about. The scuffle that had been gradually increasing there was most convenient. Mr. Trepinnock went on puffing. The terriers were squabbling over a cutlet-bone Lawrence had given them a minute or two before. One had it in his mouth and was rapidly describ ing semicircles backwards and forwards, growling, while the other made little darts at the end of each semicircle over the shoulders of the first, and always just missed the cutlet-bone ; but that did not prevent his growling too ; it merely made it intermittent. \"Drop it then,\" said the Squire, the only effect of which was to send the possessor of the cutlet bone under the sofa, which was a little further from him than the table, and bring the other to D"], [68, "50 LAWRENCE WESTERTON his knee. Lawrence comforted it with a piece of bacon. \" Worrits they are to be sure,\" said the Squire ; \" I hope you don't mind dogs. The place is alive with 'em here. I don't know what I don't pay in licences.\" \"You should see that little chap under the sofa there when he's got business on,\" he con tinued, in a tone that at once accounted for the multitude and consequent expense. \" You put him in after an otter. One of 'em's bound to come out pretty quick, and it isn't Grips as comes first, I can tell you.\" \" What do you call this ? \" asked Lawrence, taking the shaggy little head between his hands as it rose in expectation of more bacon. \" Oh ! he's Grabs,\" replied the Squire. \" He'll do in time. He's only a puppy yet, you see, but he's as plucky as \" He paused for com parison, nothing he could think of for the moment affording any idea of Grabs' courage. \" As your daughter,\" suggested Lawrence, boldly. \" Yes, that'll do,\" said the Squire. \" I'll lay she didn't scream or go into hysterics, or that sort of thing over that business yesterday.\" \"No indeed,\" said Lawrence. \"I was more scared than she was, ever so much.\" \" I dessay,\" said the Squire ; \" not reflectin' on you, though. But she's grown up too like a boy to do that kind of thing. I'm rather proud of her perhaps ; but she's all I've got left to be proud of, you see.\" And a little"], [69, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 51 shadow came across his face; but it passed in an instant. \"They keep very good cider here,\" he said ; \" I think I'll take a glass.\" \" Won't you have some breakfast ? \" asked Lawrence, suddenly bethinking himself of the demands of hospitality. \" No, I thank you,\" replied Mr. Trepinnock. \"We're not over-fashionable in our meal-times down here. Lunch quarter to one, dinner six all the year round, 'cept huntin' days of course, when we get it when we can.\" And he rang the bell for his rider. Polly appeared, received his order, vanished, and reappeared like the best machinery for rapidity and effectiveness ; only, she had the advantage over machinery of being able to smile all the time. Mr. Trepinnock thanked her, nodded towards Lawrence, took a long sip and resettled himself in his chair. \" So you've come down here to fish,\" he said. \" And what did you catch yesterday ? \" \" Three dozen, about.\" \" Three dozen ! \" said the Squire. \" Why you ought to have got six at least a day like that. The water's not too clear this morning.\" \" I shut up after lunch,\" said Lawrence over hastily. The Squire seemed to ponder a moment. \"Ah, well !\" he said. \" It's no good overdoing it the first day. I've got sick of it myself some times. But there's plenty of fish to be caught, as I dessay you saw, spite of the clap-nets and poachers from Plymouth ; though nothing like there used to"], [70, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 52 be times I can remember. But I hope you'll have better days than that before you go back. I sup pose you'll be stayin' some little time.\" \" Well, the courts don't sit again for more than a fortnight,\" said Lawrence ; and devoutly hoped, for his reputation's sake, that the Squire would not ask for the exact date. \" S'pose you don't find the Bar take up too much of your time at present ? \" inquired Mr. Trepinnock. \" At least, one hears it's not much of a profession at the start.\" \" No,\" laughed Lawrence. \" But I'm lucky enough to be independent of that ; yet I've a few friends too. You see my father's old firm send me some work ; they've been rather good to me.\" \" Marshlands & Newbody ? \" suggested the Squire. \" Yes,\" said Lawrence. \" You know them ? \" \" I've met old Marshlands often,\" said the Squire, \" down shooting at Mr. Ogle's here. Not much of a shot, but he used to make me roar with laughing at his yarns. He happened to mention your father once, and spoke very well of you, when I told him I'd met you at Cambridge.\" And he took to the cider again. \" But that seems a while ago now, doesn't it?\" he went on, \" and I've been expecting you'd turn up here and give us a visit some day ever since ; though of course there was no reason why you should after the boy died.\" Lawrence fingered the crumbs of the tablecloth. \" I hardly liked to come after that,\" he said."], [71, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 53 \" Why not, lad, why not ? \" said the Squire, growing paternal at the memory of his loss. \" Why, I'd have been only too glad to see you any time. It's not so many people we see down here, especially friends. And I'm glad of it too,\" he added inconsistently, and finished the cider. \" Well, I see you've about done your breakfast. So, still supposin' you don't want to be off fishin' again, I'll be glad of your company. But don't let me hurry you though.\" He remembered that even he did not care about starting off directly after meals \u2014 at least not nowadays. \" Oh ! I'm ready to be off at once,\" said Law- rence. So they got up to go, Grips and Grabs scuttling out before them with that never-failing delight at a change of scene peculiar to dogs, and set off down the road. \"Rather different from London \u2014 eh ?\" said the Squire with a general nod at the moor. \" Have to walk here to get anywhere.\" \" Just suit me,\" said Lawrence. \" My father and I used to do a lot of tramping and sketching round about London, and my legs aren't afraid.\" \" Ah ! \" said Mr. Trepinnock, \" heaps of artist fellers come out here. You'll find something worth drawing I should think ; rather wild perhaps \u2014 at least so they say.\" \" All the better. As I drove over the other day I saw plenty I should like to try my hand at before I go back.\" The road led on for more than a couple of miles"], [72, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 54 between two walls of granite blocks ; and as there was nothing particularly requiring attention in its immediate vicinity, beside the river below, the con versation flagged for a spell, then after an eddy or two round the weather and agricultural prospects, took a course along the doings of Mr. Gortinglass and other local sportsmen, and the Squire's own otter hounds (though the last formed the main channel) ; until they came to a little valley, which brought down a tributary to the river on their right, and turned off up a lane that led to Mr. Buckle's whitewashed farm. But Mr. Buckle was away fairing, and the ponies consequently for some inscrutable reason invisible ; so the woman who seemed the only creature in the lonesome little place, except a draggled chicken or two, assured them. Mr. Trepinnock wished her good-day, and with a muttered imprecation compre hending the ponies his own person and that of Mr. Buckle led Lawrence round to the back of the farm and up the hill behind. It was hot walking, but the Squire never paused an instant, whether from irritation or the desire to test Lawrence's legs, until they got to the top and found themselves on part of the ridge along which wound the sheep-track that did duty for a path. But he did stop there for Lawrence to take a look round, and himself enjoy the effect of such a panorama as lay before them upon a stranger. Far as eye could see for the summer haze lay mile upon mile of cotton grass and heather, vibrat ing with the heat, with here and there a greener"], [73, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 55 patch that marked a swamp, round which the cattle were gathered, lazily browsing ; range after range of billowy slope sweeping up from the broad expanse of table-land to break the sky-line with the tors that crested their flattened summits ; northwards towards Chagford and Moreton-Hampstead and the Merripits, eastwards to the glimmer of the sea beyond Teignmouth and Torquay, southward to the heights between Holne and Princetown, and west ward to Darthead and the hidden Cranmere, with the line of tors leading up to it. \" That's what I call a view,\" said the Squire presently, and commenced to point out the different places, and reel off a catalogue of the names of the tors and the rivers in their courses below \u2014 \" only you can't see 'em, of course,\" he needlessly ex plained \u2014 faster than Lawrence could possibly have followed, even if he had been attending. But Lawrence was too overpowered with the actual immensity of the space spread out before him, and too absorbed in the contemplation of its solemn growing grandeur to care two straws what the names given to little bits of it by human beings might be. The Squire watched him for a while with the delight every showman feels when his show is properly appreciated. He had an opportunity, too, of taking stock of Lawrence's general appearance, which afforded him a good deal of satisfaction. He wondered how London had managed to produce such arms and shoulders, and why Lawrence did not stoop after the manner he considered characteristic"], [74, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 56 of Londoners. The young man's air of quiet power excited his open-hearted admiration ; and he could not help wishing he had been there to see him carry Doris up that hill, doubting whether he could have done it himself, even when he was Lawrence's age. At last he said : \" We'd better be getting on a bit, or we shall be late. It's a good step on home : \" loud enough to bring Lawrence out of his ab straction. \" I've never seen anything so lonesome and grand before,\" the latter remarked with conviction as he turned towards the Squire ; and his eyes showed plainly that he meant what he said. It certainly was a good step. Upon the ridge itself there was hardly a breath, and whenever they came to a dip the hot vapour that rose through the long grass from the peat sodden by the recent rains was almost overpowering, and kept the Squire's handkerchief in continual request. Even Grips and Grabs lost all interest in their surroundings and paddled along behind with their tongues out. Lawrence was borne up by his enthusiasm for the scenery and the Squire's steady flow of geniality, which the heat seemed unable to stifle for a moment, and not least by the anticipation of meeting Doris. Still, he was thankful when at length they came to a road and turned along it for a little distance until they arrived at the lodge-gates. An avenue of stunted Scotch firs led on down the hill to Barrowdown House, which was the name of his home, Mr. Trepinnock explained, as he paused for a"], [75, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 57 while and mopped the perspiration off his red face for the hundredth time. \" Not much of an avenue,\" he remarked, opening the gate for Lawrence. \" I can't get anything like a tree to grow, up as high as this.\" But lower down, within the shelter of the hill, the firs grew taller and straighter, spreading away from the road on either side, and larches and the silver birch began to mingle with them, with a clump of laurel and rhododendron here and there ; and lower still grew the oaks and beeches, to form a dense wood, through which the drive took to twisting zigzag fashion as the fall of the slope increased. Presently Lawrence caught a glimpse through the trees of a large, whitewashed, roomy-looking house; and the next curve brought them out on to a stretch of lawn with flower-beds cut out of the edges of it, round which the drive swept on up to the porch. The house looked plain but homely enough, with its slated roof, and square-cut windows, and patches of ivy reaching half-way up the walls. On the right, overlooking the woods below, was a little terrace, with the drawing-room windows opening out upon it ; and on the terrace were two ladies, one reclining on a sofa \u2014 that must be Miss Trepin nock, thought Lawrence \u2014 and the other seated beside her, with her back towards them, on a low wicker-chair. Grips and Grabs dashed off across the lawn, and a collie raised himself from beside the sofa and danced out towards them, feather-tailed ; while"], [76, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 58 the lady rose from her chair and came down the terrace steps. \" That's our housekeeper,\" explained Mr. Trepin nock ; \" best soul in the world. Been with us five and-twenty years. She's quite one of the family.\" \" Mornin' again, Mrs. Salter,\" he cried as he drew near. See, I've brought our new surgeon up to lunch.\" Lawrence stepped up and shook hands with her. \" But you'll set lunch going as soon as you can,\" he continued, \"for I'm mortal hungry.\" \" It's waiting for you,\" said Mrs. Salter, in a sweet low voice. Lawrence thought her quite beautiful. The expression of kindness and orderliness on her time-worn face was good to see. They mounted the steps, and the Squire caught Doris in his arms and kissed her. \" And how's my poor little girl ? \" he asked. \" I've brought Mr. Westerton up to lunch, to see for himself that you're still alive. He was terrible cut up at what he'd done, and seemed to think you ought to be in bed, with the blinds down, drinking up all the awful stuff that old idiot down to Egges ford ever brewed in his life.\" Lawrence thought he must have concealed his anxiety very badly after all. \" Oh ! I'm getting along beautifully,\" she said, \" thank you ; only I sha'n't be able to walk for a few days ; at least, so Mrs. Salter says, though I believe she's quite wrong. And how do you do Mr. Westerton ? \" she said, looking at him without a"], [77, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 59 trace of confusion, and holding out her hand. \" I'm afraid I gave you no end of trouble yesterday; and I couldn't thank you for it either, for I never came to myself properly till I got home.\" \" Comes o' drinkin' neat whisky in the heat of the day,\" said the Squire ; and Doris smiled with as much superciliousness as she could command, which was very little indeed. \"I'm so very sorry I hurt you so,\" stammered Lawrence, abashed. \" I'm afraid I was very reck less. And it was all my fault, too, for being there.\" \" That could hardly be helped,\" she replied. \" How were you to know that I was coming along, wading too ? \" And just a flicker of a smile crossed her face. \" If he had known of course he would have fished the other branch of the river,\" thought the Squire. \" I hope it doesn't hurt you much now,\" Law rence said. \" Oh dear, no ! It's wrapped up in cotton wool and all sorts of things, till I feel like a gouty old gentle man; but it doesn't hurt a bit. Only, I hate having to lie up on a day like this and being forbidden to move for fear of starting inflammation and horrible things.\" Further inquiries were interrupted by the reappear ance of Mrs. Salter in company with the butler, to announce lunch. \" Now, then, John,\" said the Squire, \"you collar that end.\" He himself took up the sofa by the head, and together they carried Doris through the"], [78, "60 LAWRENCE WESTERTON drawing-room across the hall into the dining-room, in spite of her expostulations that she could do quite well with an arm. Lawrence and Mrs. Salter followed. It was easy to see in what direction Mr. Trepinnock's tastes and pursuits lay. Lawrence had time to notice that the hall was crowded with sticks and whips and antlers and masks and brushes and glass cases of stuffed fish, birds, and beasts, squirrels and otters predominating, and a heap of other things, enough to start a museum ; and the dining-room, which looked out upon the lawn, was decorated largely after a similar fashion ; only it had the additions of several sporting prints, a few engravings after Landseer, and a family portrait or two. It was simply furnished with a tremendous oak sideboard, a bookcase that occupied the whole of the end opposite the windows, a table that could have seated half a dozen a-side without undue squeezing, and leather-covered chairs that could comfortably have carried two a-piece \u2014 everything on a large scale, after the old fashion. The Squire took one end of the table and Doris sat up on her sofa at the other, while Mrs. Salter and Lawrence affected a partial adornment of the sides, with a wilderness of tablecloth extended before them, whose square measure, in feet, must have been pretty near the hundred. At least so Lawrence roughly estimated, though he had no inclination to observe his surroundings in general very closely with such an object as Doris before him. For the first time he was able to take a good,"], [79, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 61 quiet look at her ; and she certainly was very beau tiful as she sat with the bookcase behind her and the light full upon her face. Her complexion was as clear and transparent as health and sun could make it, of a tint like that of very pale burnt sienna; as unlike to the fearful red of the unhappy Londoner after a fortnight's summer holiday as a sunrise is to a cheap lithograph representing the same. Her mouth was not full red, but of the soft pink of heather bells, and the lines of it curved into a calm true bow more sug gestive of our forefathers' self-yews than that com plicated affair of Cupid's ; rounded chin ; the short straight nose characteristic of Devonshire beauty, cut clearly and daintily enough to show the move ment of her breath. But her eyes Lawrence felt entranced with, so clear and bright and steady were they, the arch of surprise outward curving in the parabola of the eyebrows. Her forehead was high, and would have looked higher but for the bronzed waves that fell over it closely, emphasising the angularity of her temples in their sweep backwards towards the knot, Greek fashioned \u2014 rather untidily maybe. She wore a full grey-blue cotton dress bound round the waist quite simply with a band of dark ribbon ; and the silver buckle that fastened it was the only ornament about her, except one magni ficent sapphire ring upon the forefinger of her right hand. The Squire was too busy carving and eating to say much, so the conversation fell to the other"], [80, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 62 three, naturally turning upon first impressions of Dartmoor. So entirely favourable were Lawrence's, Mrs. Salter visibly glowed satisfaction. And then to have the junket, prepared in accordance with principles long experience had qualified her for carrying into practice as well as any woman in Devon, appreciated so ! Doris laughed to see the glow, at the discomfort of her own position, necessi tating an elbow on the table all the time, at her father's very occasional small jokes, at the inter mittent squabbles of Grips and Grabs for posses sion of the best place on the tail end of the sofa. The atmosphere of homeliness and merriment was exhilarating. Lawrence had never breathed the like. He became more than conversational, forgetting the reticence and self-reserve with which he had enveloped himself for the last few years as if they had never been. He broke into anecdotes, accounts of his London brieflessness and loneli ness, self-mocking, and unbosomed himself to an extent he had never dreamed of doing since his father's death ; and all because the sun was shining upon him from the bottom end of the table as no sun had shone upon him before. Mrs. Salter's amusement and delight at his, to her, novel and entertaining ways of looking at things, sought support in side glances at Doris every now and again. She thought she could detect very decided signs of similar admiration there, and immediately fell to speculating, as is the habit of middle-aged women under such circum stances."], [81, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 63 There was an element of uncertainty in the speculation she could very well have dispensed with ; for though she had known Doris from child hood, she had never been able from the standpoint of her own middle-class opinions \u2014 and they were as inelastic as middle-class opinions, however honest, usually are \u2014 to appreciate the motives that actuated the girl, or consequently predict with any confidence the line of conduct she would pursue, even upon the most ordinary occasions. Under standing was at fault. Gradually, however, she had arrived at the somewhat unsatisfactory con clusion \u2014 unsatisfactory because she had a deep grown affection for the Squire's daughter, as well as a very settled faith in her own convictions \u2014 that the presumption was usually against Doris behaving as she, Mrs. Salter, would expect any other young woman to act. It never occurred to her to scrutinise her own standard of womanliness by the light of Doris' behaviour, instead of attempting to reconcile the latter with it continually. If she had done so, she would have found it very capable of expansion, and she might in time have been enabled to substitute some better method of prophecy for that which only dealt with negatives. Doris was so self-confident, or rather so wilful, so fond of sport and the out-door life of which Mrs. Salter did not approve when carried to ex tremes (Mrs. Salter's extremes were very accessible), and so contemptuous of the usual accomplishments proper to women ; the chief of which Mrs. Salter"], [82, "64 LAWRENCE WESTERTON held to be needlework of every description, and after that perhaps the making of pastry. Not that she was entirely wrong either; only her views lacked breadth and adaptability. Still she loved Doris very dearly, and could reverence her motives when she did stitch, for then it was upon frocks and cloaks and baby linen for the poor folk round ; but could never account for her unnatural dislike for the actual work, though she would work by the day together over them, or her absolute refusal to contribute to the adornment of the house with antimacassars, or scrap-stuck screens, or coverings for footstools and everything else, in need of covering or not. The place was littered with the elaborate productions of a good portion of Mrs. Salter's own life. Meanwhile Doris had gone her own way, riding and fishing, and reading the strangest of books in her spare moments, and wandering over the moor summer and winter, till she seemed to know every inch of it, and every living creature upon it, and could even tell the time to a day or two when those on the way thither might be expected ; nursing, and teaching, and scolding, and persuading, and conse quently behaving in a way that Mrs. Salter fre quently took upon herself to remind both her and the Squire was most unusual in young ladies of her age and position ; as perhaps it was. But the Squire would smile, and except upon those occasions he never irritated her, as he in variably replied : \" You must let the girl grow up as she will, Mrs. Salter. She can't be forced.\""], [83, "THE SQUIRE AND HIS HOME 65 And Doris usually kissed her. That was all the result her words ever produced from either. The climax of her active opposition had been reached four or five years back ; since when she had retired upon mild expostulation : cause, the open rejection of her counsel by Doris. It had happened on this wise. One day, riding over the moor alone, as was her habit, Doris had espied one of the worst of the loafers of the neighbourhood, a notorious poacher, who had so far managed to escape conviction and had grown audacious in consequence, actually setting night-lines in broad daylight along the bank of her father's water ; and with a reckless disregard of consequences and never a thought as to what she could do with him when she got there, had ridden down upon him and charged him to his face. The fellow had turned upon her with curses and insults, mingled with references to her brother's character true enough to sting her to the quick, and in a gust of passion she had slashed him across the face with her riding-whip and all the strength of lissome eighteen. Smarting and furious with pain the man had seized her bridle and snatched the whip from her hand as she raised it for repetition, and then had suddenly dropped the rein, and turning as pale as he had been crimson before, muttered sul lenly : \" God strike me dead, miss, if I hurt a hair of yer sunny 'ead ; \" and smashed her whip across his knee, as if to put it out of his power. She had ridden home and poured out the story to Mrs. Salter, who was for invoking the penal codes of E"], [84, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 66 the inhabited globe \u2014 item, the establishment of Princetown as the nearest embodiment \u2014 to punish the man who would not submit to any correction her young mistress thought fit to impose, and coun selled communication to the Squire immediately as the nearest road towards effectual vengeance. But Doris had insisted on his never knowing, and had, in defiance of all Mrs. Salter could urge against such a want of dignity, gone down to the man's cottage next morning and apologised to him with her glove off. She had done more ; for relying upon her father's fondness for herself and his admiration for most of Charles Kingsley's sayings she had pre vailed upon him, as a means of reforming the man and at the same time protecting his own interests in the best way possible, to turn the poacher into an under-water-keeper. George Hutchins had accordingly been white washed and started in that office ; and the increase of fish, remarked upon by others as well as Doris, had seemed to justify the selection. All of which provided humiliation for Mrs. Salter. Inwardly she had recognised that youthful impetuosity had chosen the better part, even regarded from a merely utili tarian point of view. Nevertheless the rejection of her counsel had been a slight upon herself not to be forgotten, a reflection moreover. And if one's advice be put aside, however gently, it affords one little enough gratification to know that it was looked upon as well-meaning."], [85, "CHAPTER V THE PLEASANTNESS OF SUNSHINE After lunch Doris was taken out on to the terrace again, and Mrs. Salter discreetly retired. Mr. Trepinnock brought out a chair and the pipe, and under cover of the Western Morning News dropped quietly and comfortably off to sleep ; leaving Law rence to bask in the sunshine of Doris' presence and to find that conversation, carried on in low tones on the sleeper's account, became exceedingly easy and interesting beneath its influence. She had that power peculiar to good women, outcome of practical exercise of true sympathy, of being able to listen and inspire confidence. She asked him all sorts of questions with such an un affected air of interest and withal that quiet assumption of right, which is at once the proof and prerogative of pure unselfishness, that Lawrence went babbling on about his past life and experiences without pausing an instant for reflection. Even if he had reflected he need only have looked into her eyes to have started off again reassured. As it"], [86, "68 LAWRENCE WESTERTON was he felt intuitively that he could trust her and thought nothing at all about it. She tried to induce him to talk about her brother and their friendship at Cambridge when she noticed that he seemed to avoid that subject. But it was rather a difficult one to handle. Lawrence did not know how far her eyes had been opened to her brother's real character, and the nature of the various disasters that had culminated in his death. She might regard him as one of the unfortunate, the misunderstood, and unappreciated of the world. If so he was not going to take upon himself to undeceive her. At the same time he was too honest to corroborate that view to the extent she would expect or adopt the panegyrical style, even to his dead friend's sister ; and he felt that she would not be satisfied with mere commonplace accounts of their doings and difficulties together. But she appeared to divine the cause of his hesitation, after he had made one or two attempts and stumbled into reminiscences of the most ordi nary description ; and said : \" That isn't a bit what I want to hear, Mr. Westerton. I know quite well my brother was very far from being all he ought to have been, and don't want you to praise him. But you were his friend. He used to tell us so much about you that we have always regarded you as ours too. He always looked up to you so, and said you were the only man he knew he could trust. I want you to tell me why he trusted you and why you stuck to him as you did.\""], [87, "THE PLEASANTNESS OF SUNSHINE 69 \" But I didn't,\" said Lawrence inconsequently, \" I'm ashamed to say. When he left Cambridge I lost sight of him altogether. It's no use excusing myself by saying I couldn't leave Cambridge then. I gave it up. You see I'd begun to distrust myself. Guide anybody else ! Honestly I thought it better for both to stop trying. Played out. But if I'd known, as I might have known if I hadn't quarrelled with him at last, I might possibly have \u2014 have been prouder of myself to-day.\" \"You are rather unjust to yourself, aren't you ? \" she said. \" It was no fault of yours that he went his own way ; he had a will of his own. We have,\" she added proudly. \" But tell me how your friendship grew. You will not pain me. We have got be yond that now, though you have never been near us to say a word for him ; and no one else was likely to do so.\" Here was a staggerer. It had never occurred to Lawrence that it could be in his power to lighten any one's sorrow. This expected of him here! Never given, thought of. He reddened. \" I am sorry,\" she said. \" What have I said ? How could we expect it? I did not mean to reproach you. Come, as much as you can remember, tell me.\" And Lawrence did ; so far as he dared. All the history of their quarrels and reconciliations, adven tures and mishaps together came out gradually, in a jumbled and inconsecutive form certainly. That was to be expected and she was not inclined to find fault with it. And as he went on he forgot"], [88, "70 LAWRENCE WESTERTON everything but the strange fascination which the out cast friend of college days, with his reckless contempt for life and limb and the laws of God and man, had exercised over himself, and the fact that he was relating the story of it to one who had already begun to fascinate him in a widely different manner. Fervour grew eloquent. The story was no defence, but it was human as the reality had been, perhaps rather more human than Lawrence would have cared to make it at unenthusiastic moments. And through it all shone the glow of that staunch affection which disdained to excuse or explain where a tacit concurrence might possibly justify his friend's failings by apparent identification with his own, or at all events put him also upon his defence. That was not lost upon Doris. A man is a fool or a very true friend who will risk the rest of his character in a woman's eyes for the sake of loyalty such as that. Nor did she think him a fool. But of his last great quarrel with Arthur he could hardly bring himself to speak. Mutual recriminations and Arthur had gone down and he had never seen his face nor heard from him directly again. Self- accusation afterwards and finally self-condemnation when he had heard of Arthur's suicide. Lawrence did not spare himself. His voice rose and he forgot the sleeper. And all the while she sat with her eyes upon the distance of the woods below, solemnly twirling the sapphire ring ; while the breeze stirred the"], [89, "THE PLEASANTNESS OF SUNSHINE 71 fringes of her hair into a halo gilded by the sun. \" Ah ! \" she said as he paused at length, \" I was too young then or I might have saved him.\" Lawrence thought no saint from heaven was better fitted to have done so, and turned away his eyes in reverence to where the Squire sat. He was very much surprised to see that he had woken up and had evidently been listening attentively. His handkerchief was hanging rather suspiciously out of his pocket and his face was drawn and rather hard ; but its sternness melted at once as his eyes met Lawrence's, and half its sadness vanished. He got up and laid his hand on Lawrence's shoulder ; then, suddenly changing his intention as to what he was about to say, asked him whether he cared about seeing the kennels. \"There's nothing much else to show you,\" he said. \" Blame the little beggar, he's got my handkerchief.\" Grabs had profited by the opportunity and was now engaged tearing at the handkerchief at the other end of the terrace. The chase and recapture brought the Squire back beaming all over again, with Grabs dancing round him for another chance. \" Oh Grabs, you dear little beast ! \" cried Doris, \" come up and be kissed.\" Grabs hesitated be tween these conflicting temptations, but finally jumped up on to Doris, with the stump of his tail working like a pendulum with the weight off. The realisation of the promise was imminent when Grips, hitherto lying quietly at the sofa's foot, as age befitted, started up, all jealousy, to prevent it."], [90, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 72 There was a scuffle over Doris as she lay, and the collie rose from the flags to see what it was about. But Doris did not seem to mind being trampled upon in the least. She got an arm round each at the first pause and bent them down to her sides. Jealousy subsided at that equal distribution of her favour ; while collie was too sensible to be hurt by the seeming neglect of himself, but licked her hand and lay down again. \" You'll spoil those little brutes if you fuss over them like that,\" said the Squire. \" But come on, Westerton. You won't mind being left alone a bit, dearie,\" he added to Doris. \" Mrs. Salter will bring out tea soon, and you shall give us some when we come back. You take tea ? \" to Law rence. Lawrence did take tea. It would have been difficult to find anything he did not take if Doris was to officiate. He could drink tea with any curate in the land. \" Ah well ! so I do sometimes,\" said the Squire, and with a smile at his daughter he caught Law rence's arm and led him back up the avenue for a bit, and then down the hill to the buildings set apart for his own particular hobby. Lawrence thought otter hounds very much like most other hounds. He did not say so, however, but endeavoured to be as appreciative as was con sistent with his ignorance, and listened with the greatest attention while the Squire discoursed upon the pedigrees and prowess of the pack in general and its most prominent members in particular,"], [91, "THE PLEASANTNESS OF SUNSHINE 73 their various claims to distinction being supported by frequent reference to the best of last summer's runs, until he began to think that otter hunting must be very grand sport indeed ; as no doubt it is. Then there were a couple of setters and a re triever to be admired and made friends of, and the stables to be inspected ; with the pair of carriage horses, a hack or two, and Doris' hunter as special objects of remark, standing therein in the state of sleepy enjoyment of monotony and patient expecta tion horses affect when at home. \" No, given up riding myself,\" replied the Squire to inquiry as to whether he did not keep a hunter for himself, \" and I wish the girlie would. It isn't safe in this country. I've seen some awful smashes. You see it's these walls and boulders. It's all good enough going except for them and the bogs ; but the bogs you get to know or your mount does. But when you get on to one of these slopes amongst the granite that's strewn all over the place, and your horse is about done, and you've caught a glint in front of what the hounds '11 be on to directly, you have to take your chance. It's not many as can pull up then, and if you do come down there always seems to be more granite than grass, and it's all over in a snap then. It's difficult to find a hurdle too sometimes. I've lost my nerve I suppose. It's not worth it. But the young ones know best, of course,\" he added with a sigh, and they strolled back to the terrace. Mrs. Salter had reappeared and a little tea-table"], [92, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 74 had been brought out. Round it were grouped, awake and expectant, Grips, Grabs, and Collie. Doris presided and poured out the Squire some very weak tea. The others had to wait until it was stronger. \" And how much will you remember ? \" she said suddenly to Lawrence. \" Of what ? \" he asked, taken aback. \"Of Oliver's and Albert's and Marie's and Osborne's and all the rest of their doings of course,\" she replied. \" I am sure father's been boring you horribly with those hounds and their histories. You see you're a visitor and had to suffer. \" Too bad,\" chuckled the Squire. \" Westerton wasn't a bit bored. Were you, Westerton ? \" Lawrence disclaimed. \" I was introduced to several of them personally,\" he said. \"Their names struck me as rather familiar and odd ; but I've no experience with hounds, so didn't like to ask questions ; and your father didn't explain.\" \" No, I don't suppose he did,\" she said laughing \" He's rather sore upon that point. I don't think he likes the names I've given them. He's run out of names himself long ago you see, so I've called them after the Reading biscuits ; for that's better than having warriors and conquerors and coun sellors and all that unoriginal sort of thing eternally. They're known all round as the Huntley and Palmers', and father doesn't think it at all dignified. But I expect you have been bored all the same. You'll have to make up for it, father,\" she continued mischievously, \" and ask him to come to our picnic"], [93, "THE PLEASANTNESS OF SUNSHINE 75 on Monday. He'd like that much better. You see, Mr. Westerton, we are going to have a beautiful picnic up on Crocodile Tor over there \u2014 you can just see the place from here \u2014 not an ordinary sort of picnic. Father and Mrs. Salter, and three of the school-children, who have just got over the measles and haven't had any fun at all lately, are coming with me. And Mr. Wren, he's our parson, is coming too. It'll be grand, that is if you've had measles. I always choose Crocodile Tor because there's no water within a quarter of a mile, all down hill, and it's part of the fun of a picnic bring ing it up. And then we light a fire on the top ; and of course you're rather handy at making fires and carrying things up hill.\" And she smiled as demurely as her merriment would permit. \" You'd be quite an acquisition.\" Lawrence allowed that he had had measles, so that there was nothing to prevent his attending ; though if he had not he would cheerfully have run the risk involved ; and also allowed that nothing gave him greater pleasure than carrying things up hill on occasion. And she smiled again. \" After tea,\" she went on, \" the children roll down hill ; that's another advantage of Crocodile Tor ; and you superintend them and prevent their hurting themselves. They get awfully messed. The whole school did it last year. I never laughed so much in my life ; though I had to make up for it afterwards, for they spoilt their clothes, and Mrs. Salter and I had quite a fortnight's heavy dressmaking before their mothers would look at us"], [94, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 76 again. They tried to make father roll down too, but he got cross and came home alone and swore horribly \u2014 didn't you ? \u2014 that you wouldn't go pic nicking with me again. But he's going Monday, aren't you, father ? \" \" I suppose so \"\u2022 \u2014 with resignation ; \" but it's too bad of you to drag Mr. Westerton into it.\" \" Not at all,\" said Lawrence ; \" I'll roll down with pleasure if they like.\" Mrs. Salter made an addition to the speculation notes. Young men are not usually over-ready to court apoplexy for the sake of other people's children.\" \" Of course we give them jam,\" said Doris. \" If you come you'll have to help spread it for them.\" Lawrence, never having beheld the association of jam and school-children, hesitated not. He reck lessly consented to do that also. \" But you'll like Mr. Wren.\" \" That he will,\" added the Squire. \" He's as upright a young fellow and as hard a worker and as kind and self-sacrificing a soul as it's been my lot to meet. D'ye know, Westerton, he nearly got killed one night last winter. He set off in a snowstorm to see a dying woman over the other side the ridge and lost his way. He's not a native you see. Of course he ought to have taken some one with him, or not have tried to go at all. He had to lie up under a wall, and would have spent the night there too and perished with cold, if his housekeeper had not run up here an hour or two after he'd gone and told Doris she was afraid he'd got lost in the snow."], [95, "THE PLEASANTNESS OF SUNSHINE 77 I was away myself at the time, or Doris should never have gone out that night. But she went after him with Tom Westaway \u2014 he's my hunts man \u2014 and the stable boys and some of the dogs and lanterns and brandy and things, and found him after a time. They'd some trouble bringing him round ; and all he thought of when he did come to was the woman, who, as it happened, died that night. He said he'd never forgive himself for being such a duffer (that's not exactly his language, but the meaning of it p'raps) as to lose his way trying short cuts instead of sticking to the road. I don't believe he's got over it yet. He had to have two fingers amputated, but he thought nothing of that, but only what he considered was his failing in his duty.\" \" Most men don't look on getting frost-bitten and risking their lives doing it, failing in it,\" put in Lawrence. \" I'd like to see the man who could.\" \" He's not much to see,\" said Doris, \" except for his eyes. But there's not a man or woman for miles who wouldn't do the same for him now, though he's only been with us a little over four years. You should have heard his sermon a Sunday or two afterwards.\" \" Yes,\" broke in the Squire. \" You see he's one who thinks it isn't any credit much to do your duty in a blind, slap-dash sort of fashion, with no regard for danger and risks, but just trusting to luck and good intentions to pull you through ; which most men con sider enough.

He talked a lot of being guilty of breach of solemn trusts com mitted to him, and that sort of thing, till I should have thought him a confounded idiot if I hadn't known the man; and ended by asking our forgiveness for what I think he called his blind pride and folly. He'd taken as his text that about the blind leading the blind. It's not many who live up to their standard when it's a deal lower than his.\" \" He comes out with the otter hounds now and then, and would ride with the foxhounds too, if he could afford a horse ; but he's too proud to take a loan, though we should all be too glad. You shall see him for yourself though, if you really mean to sacrifice yourself on Monday.\" As Lawrence resolutely maintained his willing ness so to do it was arranged that he should meet the Squire at Mrs. Lamb's, minute directions being given him as to her whereabouts, to collect the children and escort them to Crocodile Tor, where the rest would join them. After that he began to think it was about time he went away, though he would have been per fectly content to sit there drinking tea and looking at Doris indefinitely. There was the prospect of Monday however. Doris was confident her foot would be quite well enough by then ; so he shook hands with them all, and the thrill of her firm clasp at parting lasted him all the way up the avenue. As he walked back to the inn he pondered over"], [97, "THE PLEASANTNESS OF SUNSHINE 79 all his conversation with her. At the time he had felt no surprise at her wish to know more about her brother, it seemed so natural ; but he was doubtful now whether he should have told her all he had. Under her inspiration of confidence he had felt no question as to her right to know. She puzzled him with her changes of mood from grave to gay, nor did he understand his reception by her father and herself, their unconcealed satis faction at meeting Arthur's friend, and their trust and gratitude \u2014 for what ? Nothing he had done was proportionate desert. Many people would have looked upon him with something like suspicion after all that had passed. They had looked upon him and treated him as an old friend. Such entirely open cordiality had acted like a charm upon his self-contained distrustful habit of mind. For Doris herself he had conceived a feeling akin to veneration. Her imperiousness and beauty and goodness, and above all her friendly almost sisterly condescension to himself, had completely overcome him."], [98, "CHAPTER VI. A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC Next day he fished up the same water as before, with only moderate success, for no rain had fallen since his arrival ; but he took his sketch-book with him and devoted the afternoon to drawing the scene where he had met her first, with the wall and the hill behind it and the river to the right. He tried to enliven it with the figure of herself fishing in the pool, but the attempt was so strikingly inadequate that he rubbed her out again. It was a most uninteresting looking little picture to any one but himself; for there was no special beauty in the lines of the hills or the curve of the river, and he was not artist enough to invest it with any out of his own head. It wanted colour for any effect at all. Still in spite of defects in composition and hard and stony appearance it should be framed and hung up in his rooms when he got back to town, as an aid to memory of first days on Dartmoor. Then Sunday came, and he went to the little church some two miles off in hopes of seeing her. But she had not come. Renewed anxiety about"], [99, "A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC 81 her foot. The Squire was there, however, and he saw the great Mr. Wren ; and acknowledged his claims to respect as soon as he heard his earnest delivery of the opening prayers. The sermon, too, stirred him unusually. The subject was taken from that never-failing source of inspiration : \"But the greatest of these is charity.\" Mr. Wren was a small and rather coarse-featured man ; but his eyes redeemed the unattractiveness of his face, and his language could not fail to be impressive in its homely straightforward intensity. Lawrence was in a re ceptive mood and, hearing, seemed to gain a clearer insight into the nature of unselfishness and in some sort, though he was unwilling to admit to what extent, an answer to his own constant self inquiry as to the causes of the dissatisfaction arising from the purposelessness of his life ; an answer which had often suggested itself to him before, but which he had never set himself to examine atten tively or test in a practical way. There is no difficulty in recognising the value of unselfishness ; it was the preacher's skill in dealing with its exer cise and application to the exigences of every-day life that aroused his attention now. Mr. Trepinnock greeted him after service. Doris was taking care of herself to-day that she might be perfectly well to-morrow, he explained ; the wound was almost healed. \" D'ye like our parson ? \" he asked. \" I don't wonder at your good opinion of him if he always preaches like that,\" said Lawrence. \" I'm glad you liked him,\" said the Squire ; r"], [100, "82 LAWRENCE WESTERTON \" but for all that his preaching isn't his best point, not by a long way ; though I must say he can give us a sermon too sometimes. Maybe his style's over-simple, but we're simple folk down here, and I daresay it wouldn't come out quite right up London way.\" \" They might adopt it with advantage rather oftener up there all the same. But they're too busy with their dogmas and natural science and reconciliations of their own belief and opinions with difficult facts and explanations and all, just to show how tolerant the clergy can be when they condescend, to think it worth while showing us how to get over the difficulties about Dives and Lazarus, and what to do when the cholera comes and so on, let alone how to treat your neighbours when all's moderately straight going, like that chap did this morning.\" Lawrence was as unjust as people with new im pressions are apt to be. His experience too of pulpit oratory in London was of a most limited description. He neglected to allow for that. \" Ah ! Wren steers clear of scientific questions,\" said the Squire. \" If he did go into 'em we shouldn't understand him or care about it either, so perhaps it's as well. But what he's always crying out against is what he calls religiousness as opposed to religion. You know there's a good deal of dissent down here and people are rather divided. Well, I hope he'll be able to come to-morrow.\" And with a good-humoured reminder as to the place and hour of meeting the Squire nodded"], [101, "A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC 83 Lawrence \" good morning,\" and lest him to wander slowly back to the inn, and dream away the after noon by the river. Thought for much, thanks for much already, not altogether of the substance of dreams. He had come forth from the fog and smoke to breathe air, and was already conscious of change wrought in himself. And these people, whom he had been thrown among for practically the first time in his life, had in these few days begun to exercise an influence over him that he could only acknowledge without endeavouring to explain. He sat wonder ing vaguely whither it might lead, the words of the morning's sermon recurring to his mind with fresh force and growing meaning. This coarse-looking fiery-eyed little parson \u2014 had he found his inspiration amongst the solitudes of the granite waste, and his power to live and teach ? Did he love Doris ? It would be strange indeed if he did not. Love Doris ! Everything seemed to connect itself with the thought of love for Doris. Love for Doris \u2014 had he fallen in love with Doris himself that he should ascribe the force of each and every to her ? He hardly knew. He could worship from a distance, but the parson with all his coarse looks was the fitter to love her ; he knew that. Would it be possible to become fit to love her, for him ? He bowed his head upon his knees and thought. He, with his life before him and his confidence in himself and his strength of will, was he to"], [102, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 84 acknowledge that this man, shut out from a larger sphere of life by his humble duties in an out-of the-way wilderness, might yet be worthier than he, Lawrence Westerton, could ever become. As he thought there slowly unfolded itself before him an ambition, a resolution that, come what might, let the parson love her as well he might, let Doris love the parson as well she might, no man on earth should deny Lawrence Westerton the right of making himself worthy to love her too. He lifted his head and gazed into the sky with that involuntary action which will ever call Heaven to witness such determinations while the world lasts. Purpose found ! Here at last indubitably. To that purpose he would dedicate all his powers, body and soul. Difficulties ? Many. Unconquerable ? Foremost would be that of extricating himself from his entanglement with Violet Vane. What was this shuddered suspicion that this might be very difficult ? Nothing more was necessary than to quietly drop her. Common sense told him that such a course would be more than defensible. His passion for her had been of the earth, very earthy. He knew that now well enough ; any delusions he might have defended about it a week ago were scattered and gone. He was free to abandon it if he but chose. This he repeated out loud. There were no promises, no sentimental con siderations to bind him, however degrading it might"], [103, "A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC 85 be to know that liberty was owing to their absence. Loyalty was not involved except where love was involved also, and the thought of love in connection with Violet Vane was shame and humiliation. The thought itself was a treason \u2014 to whom ? to what ? He hated it. His infatuation had probably unfitted him for higher things. True ? Yet, if true, this it could never do, it could not deny him the right of attempting to grasp them or bind him to the lower for ever. That but concerned himself, himself alone. Violet Vane henceforth nothing to him. He could put her outside his calculations for any claim she had upon him. No, the difficulties would be with himself \u2014 again that shuddered suspicion \u2014 and they, yes, they seemed little enough \u2014 here\u2014 with this new-risen sun to light the way and the enthu siasm of this newly found Purpose to spur him on. He could almost have wished them greater. Shud der and suspicion ! \u2014 Purpose is mine. Oh Lawrence ! Conquerable ? Despicable also are these same difficulties ? Monday came and with it the glory of the sun once more. Fishing was out of the question, so he gave his morning to making an elaborate facsimile of the inn as seen from the other side of the stream. Decision of yesterday had already given unusual power of taking pains. When he had finished it, he knew that the drawing was the best of its kind he had ever made. It was firm and true and clear from"], [104, "86 LAWRENCE WESTERTON hesitation as his own mind. Mrs. Baker volubly \" had never seen the like ;\" and even Joe, who conde scended to personally superintend finishing touches for want of other active occupation, allowed that \" there was summat about it as quite took his fancy,\" though perhaps it might not compare very favourably with the photograph of the place that hung in the parlour, \" if you was to put 'em side by side.\" Lawrence received this criticism with all humility appropriate, and, having tested its justice in Joe's presence and the way suggested, extorted what slight further commendation Joe considered such a deference to his discernment demanded. Then he ate his lunch and donned a tidier pair of knickerbockers, a spotless shirt, and a Norfolk jacket ; he felt anxious about his personal appearance for honestly the first time in his life. If it did come to rolling down hill a Norfolk jacket was the very thing. He was resolved to do his best to ensure the success of Doris' entertainment ; and as a necessary pre liminary set off in the highest spirits a good three quarters of an hour too soon, and had to sit on a gate, kicking his legs to the accompaniment of horrible misgivings as to whether he had mistaken the rendezvous after all. But the Squire came at last, and the business of collecting the convalescents over they set out for Crocodile Tor with an initial solemnity speedily dispelled by the Squire's production of a bottle of brandy-balls and the enlivening influence they in fused into the surrounding atmosphere."], [105, "A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC 87 Half an hour's climb and sucking brought them to the Tor, where they sat down to rest and wait for Doris and further provision. \" Parson coming ? \" asked Lawrence. \" Oh, yes,\" replied the Squire. \" He's up lunch ing to Barrowdown. I left him there to help bring up the things. He's younger than I am I told him.\" Presently behold ! a procession consisting of Doris on a pony with hamper behind her and Mrs. Salter and the vicar toiling along beside it. She waved her hand and the children rushed down towards her screaming. A sting of envy of the vicar shot into Lawrence's heart, to be disdained into nothingness as soon as felt. Mrs. Salter and the parson were quite breathless by the time they arrived at the top, for it was a stiff climb, and in addition to carrying a kettle in one hand and a bag in the other the parson was further embarrassed by one of the girls pulling her self up by his coat-tails, while the boy devoted his energies to lashing him over the legs with Doris' riding-whip. But his expression of good-tempered amusement was a sight to see. \" First of the week day sermons,\" thought Lawrence ; \" I can profit.\" Advancing he would have offered her aid to dis mount, and said : \" I hope you have quite got over your accident, Miss Trepinnock.\" \" Just see,\" she cried, and slipped off the pony before he could reach her. \" I'm glad you've not failed us,\" she added, giving him a hand. \" I'm not to walk about much, that's all. So I shall sit"], [106, "88 LAWRENCE WESTERTON down on the rocks here and tell you all what to do. Now babies, babies, leave off worriting Mr. Wren for just one little moment, and let me introduce Mr. Westerton to him.\" \" Pleased to meet you, sir,\" said Lawrence open handed. Mr. Wren gave him a vigorous grasp. Eyes met and challenged by instinct, and the parson's recognised the defeat in store for him looming through that questioning glance given. But his smile never left his face for an instant. He had known the man must come one day, and had often pictured him endued with all the gifts denied to himself, even as this man seemed to be. He had hoped indeed that it might not be, but he was not taken unprepared. The Squire had hobbled the pony, and Mrs. Salter and the children were engaged arranging, scattering the contents of the hamper round among the boulders, and lighting a fire in a sheltered nook with the aid of a large bundle of sticks and a news paper she had thoughtfully provided. \"Now, gentlemen,\" said Doris, taking up the kettle, \" you see the brook below there,\" indicating it with her pretty forefinger ; \" which of you will volunteer ? \" They looked at each other ; neither would take the advantage. Doris enjoyed their hesitation for a moment, and then said, with her eyes dancing : \" Then if you are both so lazy, you shall both go down, and when you get to the bottom you can fill the kettle and then toss up which shall have"], [107, "A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC 89 the pleasure of carrying it up again for us.\" And she gave the kettle to Lawrence and the lid to Mr. Wren. It was too ridiculous ; but there was no help for it. They broke into a laugh in unison. Doris' appreciation of the difficulty, her adroitness was charming. They were at ease at once. Two men cannot walk a quarter of a mile with a kettle and its lid so parted between them with constraint other than that of fellowship. Lawrence began : \" Thundering good sermon of 3-ours yesterday, Mr. Wren. I don't assume in saying so. Made me sit up. We do get abominably selfish.\" \" Assume ! \" replied the parson. \" A stranger's praise is always worth having, especially to one who's tucked away into a corner of the world as I am. It encourages one to think one isn't standing still and letting things slide ahead. I ought to own I like to see a stranger come into my church some times, for then I can gauge myself a bit by him. I can tell more by chance visitors than I can by my parishioners. That's natural, of course. It takes their lives to tell me if my preaching is on the right lines ; but strangers are necessarily critics, and I can't help observing them pretty carefully \u2014 to see if they get bored. That's natural too.\" \" I'm sure I went with no intention of criticising,\" said Lawrence, as was indeed perfectly true. \"Or approving either?\" laughed the little man. \" You couldn't help doing the one, but you have done the other too ; and as I say I am not above"], [108, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 90 appreciating it. You are staying at the Three Foxes Miss Trepinnock tells me.

I'll look out for a chat.\" \" Thanks,\" said the parson. \" It's so very few people I have the chance of meeting here that I can't afford to let opportunities slide, even at the risk of intruding myself. Is this your first visit to Dartmoor ? \" \" Yes,\" said Lawrence, smiling at the pump action. \" And what do you think of it ? I suppose you've come to fish. Most visitors do.\" \" Yes, I came to fish. And as to my opinions of it, in spite of your lack of society I should consider a man could be very well content to spend a good slice of his life here. But then we Londoners think much the same of any place when we get away for a change, so my opinion's not worth very much after all.\" \" Oh ! Londoners are not peculiar as to that,\" said the parson. \" And a man may certainly be very content to live here. Besides, what society lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality ; though for those that can't afford to keep a trap the walking gets rather wearisome. But you have"], [109, "A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC 91 chosen the best time of the year to see the place.\" \"It's rather ridiculous walking down to fetch up water for a school treat this way,\" he went on presently. \" I think I've done it regularly twice a month in summer every year since I've been here. You should have got me off for once.\" \" Why didn't you speak up and tell me so ? Miss Trepinnock would have let you off. The school must get rather tired of picnics.\" \" But not of Miss Trepinnock you see,\" said the parson. \"Ah!\" thought Lawrence, \"sensible Dartmoor children.\" \" Kettle-bearer in ordinary ! You ought to value your office, Mr. Wren,\" he said. \" If I didn't I should not hold it for long I can tell you. Miss Trepinnock is not the lady to scatter favours where they're not valued. And somehow people round here generally do what she wants them to without being asked more than twice at the most.\" Glance at Lawrence. This small burst of confidence might inspire the other to afford him some notion of his own impressions. Law rence's gaze was over the distant hill, inscrutable. Fortunately they just then arrived at the stream. Lawrence filled the kettle, and Mr. Wren solemnly adjusted the lid. \" I conclude,\" said the former, \" that we have no choice but to obey the lady in every particular.\" \" Of course,\" said Mr. Wren and produced a halfpenny."], [110, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 92 Lawrence lost the toss to his infinite chagrin, so Mr. Wren took the kettle and they began the climb back. Omen this ? Lawrence knew himself heavily handicapped at starting without having luck against him. Childish fancy ! What had luck to do with the Purpose ? Good or bad it could not affect that. \" Thank you ever so much,\" cried Doris, when they arrived at the top. \" We have got a tremen dous fire ready for it, so don't waste a minute. Father is giving the children a ride on Joker. They'll be back directly, and you can help me cut bread and butter till they come.\" Lawrence did his best ; but even the cutting of bread and butter comes not by observation, and he gave too much attention to watching Doris' hands over the operation to be very successful himself. \" Mr. Westerton,\" said Doris, as she noticed his failure, \" you should look at what you are doing. You will have to eat all that yourself. It's not fit for the children.\" Lawrence looked at the jagged bits of bread and his inequitable distribution of butter over the same. \" Never saw such butter ; it won't spread a bit,\" he said, \" or else this knife's too springy. I was looking to see how on earth you managed to do it. When I put the butter on it just sinks in and stays there. The bread's too horribly new.

I think I'd better help Mrs. Salter with that fire.\" Mrs. Salter certainly needed assistance, for she"], [111, "A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC 93 had risen to boiling pitch herself far in advance of the water, and it required all Lawrence's efforts to arouse the remnants of the fuel into sufficient com bustion to extract even a gentle hum from the kettle. Mrs. Salter popped in an extra spoonful of tea to cover defects and filled up the pot, for the children had returned in a state of ravenous expectation. They sat down in a ring round Doris and began on the bread and butter. After that came jam, and then cake and buns, till Lawrence wondered where ever in those small bodies they found place to stow it all, and Mr. Trepinnock expressed an open belief in the possibility of the destruction of matter, accentuating the same with divers blessings on his own soul and theirs. When nothing but butterless bread remained Mr. Wren stood up and the children repeated grace after him. Then Doris read them one of Grimm's fairy tales, so that their digestive organs might not be utterly confounded. But they could not endure it for long, and as soon as the dwarf had been successfully overcome and the giant retransformed, and the marriage of the princess with the prince, to whose courage and devotion all was due, seemed but a question of a few paragraphs, they begged that the rest might be taken as read, and that they might be allowed to enjoy the great treat of the day, videlicet, to roll down the hill to wash the stickiness off fingers and faces in the brook below. Permission accorded, subject to conditions as to consideration for themselves and their clothes entirely disregarded after the first five minutes, the"], [112, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 94 performance proceeded under the personal super intendence of the Squire, Lawrence, and Mr. Wren. But though they got rid of the stickiness in the stream or by the way down to it, their appearance was not unexceptionable when they reached the top again breathless and wholly delighted ; and Doris with a rueful look lamented the task before her and Mrs. Salter in the immediate future, and then kissed them all round to quiet their consciences ; while the Squire's reproachful expression of \" Didn't I tell you so ? \" changed rapidly to one of proud and defiant approval as he sat down on a stone and fumbled for his pipe. \" You must sit down now a bit, children,\" said Doris, \" and,\" she added, turning towards Law rence, \" Mr. Westerton shall do something to amuse you. What can you do, Mr. Westerton ? \" Lawrence and every idea were forthwith poles asunder. He hesitated, trying to look as if merely considering which of the many entertaining per formances within his powers was the most appro priate for the occasion. Suddenly he remembered a bygone dexterity in causing the disappearance of coins up sleeves. \" I could do a conjuring trick or two perhaps,\" he said, \" of the frightfully amateur sort, if that would do.\" \" That would do splendidly,\" said Doris. So Lawrence with much ceremony hid a shilling in the remains of one of the loaves and produced a shilling immediately afterwards from Mr. Wren's coat sleeve, to the children's gratifying surprise."], [113, "A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC 95 The method was singularly obvious, but they were too simple to attribute success to a plurality of shillings about Lawrence, and the little boy, de sirous of credit for sagacity, albeit unsupported by observation, boldly exclaimed : \" Aye, but didn't 'e see un tak' it out first.\" This was of the nature of unintentional compliment, considering the present position of the original shilling. \" Curious,\" said Lawrence. \" Sharp boy \u2014 credit to your county. Watch it go back again.\" And with an incantation or two he jerked his hand towards the loaf, and shilling number two up his sleeve. \" Look and see.\" This second marvel surpassed the first, and youthful perspicacity was quite at a loss. \" Capital, capital,\" cried Doris, clapping her hands. \" Please do another.\" Then Lawrence performed a more or less clumsy vanishing trick with the loaf and the Squire's hat and pocket handerchief (\" lucky there aren't rabbits handy,\" he thought), and tied up the last in com plicated knots and undid them with a breath, until the children thought him even more wonderful than the peripatetic magician they had once seen at a neighbouring fair, and greedily demanded more. But Lawrence's repertory was limited. His only other show was the turning of cart wheels. He volunteered with a chuckle and thought of Bond Street. \" Can you ? \" said Doris. \" Oh 1 do try.\" Lawrence swallowed his dignity and turned three in succession, which was a creditable performance"], [114, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 96 considering his want of practice. After that nothing would satisfy the children but that Mr. Wren should attempt the same feat. But though he was willing enough to try he could only manage an awkward side somersault, ending with his back on the grass and his face very red. His failure, however, did not disconcert him. Their hilarity grew boisterous. \" I tell you what we'll do,\" he said. \" We'll play hide-and-seek among the rocks here, and Westerton and I shall be handicapped by only being allowed the use of one leg. Squire, you must play too ; we'll give you the other in.\" The Squire most reluctantly consented and Doris having been made \" home \" the fun began. To be sure the Squire fell an easy and it must be con fessed a not unwilling prey to the first that pursued him, and Mr. Wren and Lawrence got most alarm ingly hot in their endeavours to out-hop each other, the parson's energy making up for his shortness of leg ; but the children's delight knew no bounds and they charged into Doris and fell screaming beside her until the wonder was that nobody was hurt, and the whole village below did not turn out to see what such a racket, presided over by a justice of the peace, as the Squire plaintively reminded them was the fact, could possibly mean. After half an hour of it Doris called time, to Lawrence's intense relief; and having partially calmed the children's excitement by allowing them to assist in packing up the hamper, she stood them around her and sang the evening hymn to their breathless and jerky accompaniment. That closed"], [115, "A PURPOSE AND A PICNIC 97 the entertainment. Mrs. Salter took charge of the children, and set off with them down one side of the hill; and the rest, having mounted Doris on her pony and divided the baggage amongst them, started down the other. Mr. Trepinnock had some parochial matters on his mind, and drew Mr. Wren off into conversation about them, much to the parson's disappointment. He looked back wistfully at the others, accepted the inevitable, and then turned his attention cheerfully to all the Squire had to say. So Lawrence had the walk back with Doris all to himself."], [116, "CHAPTER VII PUZZLES She looked satisfied Lawrence thought, and felt he might safely consider his own efforts to contribute to the children's entertainment as part of the cause. It was assuredly little enough to have done, but just for that very reason failure would have been igno minious : and he could not afford to let slip the most insignificant chance of gaining her good opinion. In fact Doris was more than satisfied. She had been half mischievously half seriously testing him all the afternoon, and the result had exceeded ex pectation. He had consented without a shadow of protest to do things that most Tmen would have considered it beneath their dignity to do, or at all events would have done with that silent remon strance and demand for recognition of a conde scension which at once courts refusal ; and had accommodated himself to the situation and fallen in with her wishes without displaying the least anxietj* to escape looking ridiculous in her eyes or any one else's : consequently he had not looked unwholesomely ridiculous for a moment."], [117, "PUZZLES 99 After all physical strength becomes us like nothing else, save courage and truth, and no true woman will ever be able to regard it with unconcern. Looking down upon him from her perch on the pony, she could mark the breadth of his shoulders and the straightness of his back, and was thinking altogether that he seemed moulded after the fashion of a man, if ever man she had looked upon was. His undisguised admiration for herself \u2014 she had seen it plainly from that first stare of his at her over the wall by the river the other day \u2014 she had taken as her due, for Doris had a looking-glass of her own and used it too ; but she was above feeling more than passing gratification at homage which called for none of her own in return, and if his had moved her it was because she was conscious of a claim in him upon something more than her mere acceptance ; a claim she had acknowledged to her self for the last few days, and was very ready to examine. \" You are fond of children ? \" she remarked presently. \" I am sure I don't know,\" replied Lawrence. \" I never met any in this sort of way before this afternoon.\" \" Have you no children to entertain in London ? \" she asked. Lawrence took fright at the suggestion. Of course there were children in London ; but they were very dirty, and objectionable in other ways besides ; they constituted a daily annoyance to him in his walk westward through the purlieus of Clare Market. The notion of entertaining them"], [118, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 100 had certainly never occurred to him.

What had he said to pro voke it ? \" Some people's time is worth very little,\" he said quietly. \"And one of the saddest of things, don't you think ? \" she continued, disregarding him, \" that those who give most are usually the very ones who have to devote the greater part of their lives to earning their living and so are debarred from the pleasure of giving more.\" \"You speak as if it were an evil to have to earn one's living.\" \" Do I ? No, not that,\" she said. \"On the contrary, one ought to regard this as just another reason for considering it a blessing, since those who have to work for their living do most good comparatively with the time they have to spare.

Because you have no actual necessity for it for your own wants ? Because it is too much trouble to find out what it is worth since your own immediate interests are not in the way of being affected by your method of spending it ?

I must bow to your condemnation as readily of course ; but it would have been more formally just perhaps to have waited until my defence had given you rather better grounds for doing so.\" She was silent ; disappointed impetuosity had said too much.

A girl's rebuke must be taken pleasantly. \"And a good thing too.\" She relented at once. \" Perhaps I was too personal,\" she said ; \" but it is maddening to hear people talk as if time was something to be simply ' passed.' Why don't you and such as you, Mr. Westerton, give the lie to the creed that allows of no energy undirected by hope of money-making ? \" And she looked as if it was maddening indeed. \" But, Miss Trepinnock, surely you confuse money-making with earning one's living, even though you allow that it is those who earn their living who do most good comparatively. The money-makers would seem not to be so contempt ible after all.\" \" Perhaps I do confuse them,\" she said ; \" but there are few men nowadays who could define exactly what they regard as earning their living and what as mere money-making. You have too many questions to answer first about honourable ambition and such like.\" \" Would you have us less ambitious then ? \" he asked. \" Do you connect ambition only with money-making and condemn that therefore too ? Isn't it rather the case that ambition is connected with earning one's living alone sometimes ? Why I too am ambitious, and yet I don't feel any particu lar desire to make my pile. I connect my ambition"], [122, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 104 with earning my living, even though my living seems given me for nothing. And it is a fact with me as with many others, that just because the earning of our living is not dependent upon actual money-making, on the marketable value of the work we turn out \u2014 just because for that reason we have a greater latitude of choice of work before us \u2014 that we find it more difficult to choose than those who are obliged to give their attention to work which is marketable, so to speak, in the first place.

What I have noticed is the fact that those who are readiest to help their brothers are those who work hard all day to earn their own living, and that those are most selfish, ambitious \u2014 call it what you like \u2014 who have no need to be so. And if you were quite honest, Mr. Westerton, you would admit that the ambition you"], [123, "PUZZLES 105 talk of is very frequently but a pretext for indulg ence in more of the pleasures of the world than are necessary for its advancement.\" \"Miss Trepinnock,\" he said, looking up into her face, voice toned by impulse to sudden entreaty, \" I am quite honest when I declare that, if I could find out the work which should hold out some prospect of satisfying a desire I have to do something with \u2014 well I don't much mind if you do think me stuck- up \u2014 with my intellect, something useful with my life, and useful in ways beyond the scope of simple charity as we understand it nowadays ; if I could reconcile my notions as to the necessity for the proper amount of selfishness, which those who ought to know call wholesome in the individual, with a lurking belief as to the necessity for absolute unselfishness as taught by religion, and come at the work which should be consistent with both, I would sacrifice the social pleasures you speak of gladly enough ; for I have none worth calling such. I know that I am idle, and that my excuse is but that which was pleaded by those who stood in the market-place all day, although the centuries have made some considerable difference in its plausibility since then. And when I read that the man is blessed who has found his work, let him ask no other blessedness, I can very well understand it, and its contrary perhaps better still.

And the poets and novelists talk of love.\" He paused and looked up at her defiantly. For the life of her she could not help reddening slightly. But she did not drop her eyes. She returned as defiantly :"], [131, "PUZZLES 113 \" Well, love ! And they mean it. Has London no woman whose love could inspire you ? \" He thought of the London women he knew.

Men are over-ready to look to women for help. After all why not go to the East End and become one of those conceited indi viduals you spoke of ? You would be able to make a comparison or two that might prove useful, if you did nothing else.\" He made no answer ; and suddenly was aware of the lodge gates a little way off in front of them. The Squire was there waiting for them, but Mr. Wren had gone home. When should he see her again, he thought? He hesitated, then plucked up courage; let her put what construction on it she liked. \" Miss Trepinnock,\" he said, \" you and your father have been very hospitable and kind to me. Might I ask you both to come to lunch with me at the Three Foxes one day ? \" His request seemed to have a connexion with their last few remarks not to be misunderstood. In his expectant face was a question too. But she was not going to commit herself, so she answered indirectly. \" Father,\" she cried, as they came nearer, \" Mr. Westerton wants to return your hospitality by asking us both to lunch one day.\" n"], [132, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 114 But the Squire never thought a second. \" Thank you, Westerton,\" he said. \" Of course we shall both be delighted. What day shall we come ? \" \" Will you name your own day ? \" The Squire considered a moment. \" Will Thurs day suit ? \" he said. Thursday would suit, but Wednesday would have suited better, and Tuesday better still. \"Thursday will do admirably,\" said Lawrence. \" And you shall keep your own hours, half-past twelve.\" \" Right,\" said the Squire, and shook his hand. \"Till Thursday then,\" said Doris. \"And thank you very much indeed, Mr. Westerton, for your help to-day.\""], [133, "CHAPTER VIII FATHER AND DAUGHTER \" Well, girlie,\" said the Squire, moderating his pace to suit the pony's. \"Joker must be getting on in life.

She laughed out merrily. \" You dear old dad, perhaps you are not so very wrong either.\" \" Well I'm bothered,\" said Mr. Treppinock, recognising his suggestion for a hit by miss of his aim ; which usually confounds for the moment. \"What a shame to tease you so, father!

I'll shake hands with him next time I see him for that.\" \"No, no; better than that,\" she cried. \"Just the very reverse.\" \"Bless me,\" said Mr. Trepinnock ; \" and yet he didn't look as if he'd been in disgrace up by the gate there. You couldn't have been in very good form, girlie.\" \" Oh yes ! I was I think. But people I go for to teach don't always get into disgrace.\" And she drew herself up in mock solemnity. \" Oh-h-h ! \" said the Squire, overcome by corresponding surprise. \" I wish I was Mr. Westerton.\" Up went her little head. \" How mean of you, father, just when I've said I was sorry for teasing you.\" \" You shouldn't have teased me first with your allegories and things ; so now we're all square again \u2014 eh, girlie ? \" \" No, you haven't said you were sorry too yet.\" He patted the foot in the stirrup beside him. \" So you like Mr. Westerton ; well, well, so do I, perhaps.\" \" I have not said so,\" she said. \" No you haven't said so,\" he replied. \" You mean that because I haven't quarrelled with him I must like him ? \" she said with a pout. \" No, I think you like me just a little ; and yet you'd quarrel with me all day long if I'd let you ; so that's nothing to go by.\""], [135, "FATHER AND DAUGHTER 117 \" You haven't anything else to go by.\" He looked up smiling into her merry face. \" Of course not ; not even Joker. But I think you like him all the same.\" \" Well, of course I'll do my best to like him just because you say you do, father. Spite of the difficulties.\" \" I'm easily pleased I know, being a plain old humdrum kind of party, or I shouldn't be so fond of my little daughter maybe. But she's got all sorts of ideas whirling round under that tousled mop up there that want considering before her mind can make itself up.\" \" Certainly she thinks Mr. Westerton im provable.\" Mr. Trepinnock's daughter was very dear to him. Her face and form, her sweetness and tenderness, the force of character that found daily expression, now playfully wilful, now serious, a hundred little graces of manner in her consideration for all about her, and above all her devoted love for himself, all were perpetual reminders to him of the pretty romantic country maiden he had wooed so many years ago now, away by the borders of Exmoor, and had lost so early in his married life. She was the centre of all his affections and the idol of his home, his one consolation in the sorrow that had overtaken him at the death of his boy. Perhaps from the very nobleness of his own soul he had confided too much to that spirit of loyalty which he had never known the want of himself, and had"], [136, "118 LAWRENCE WESTERTON dealt with his son rather in accordance with the dictates of his heart than his judgment, never doubting but that his own flesh and blood would ultimately be won over by such generosity, even after evidence had begun to point to the possibility of a contrary result. He had never acknowledged the necessity for adopting a different system of training for boy and girl, or thought that the one could be advantageously hammered into shape when he was perfectly well aware that such treatment was only capable of hopelessly marring and harden ing all feminine pliancy and beauty of character. He had made a sad mistake with the former, but his method with the latter had met with all the success such a method cannot fail to bring about with a girl naturally healthy and noble. And his heart was comforted whenever he looked into her sweet pure eyes. Latterly, however, he had been growing some what anxious for her future and had been exercising his paternal solicitude in devising schemes for providing for it after the manner he felt such a girl's suture should be provided for. The payment of his son's debts had left him burdened to an extent which precluded him from taking up the position in society that was open to him if he had not been confined by money considerations to a retired life in his country home. Not that he was sorry for that for his own sake ; but the girl was growing up, had grown up; and although he had never dared to contemplate the loneliness of his home without her that did not prevent him from taking all the"], [137, "FATHER AND DAUGHTER 119 steps his unselfishness prompted him to take to enable her to choose a home for herself. She had had offers he knew from one or two of the neigh bouring fox-hunting bachelors ; but she had refused them, and the Squire had acquiesced at once; though he would have been glad to see her settle in the neighbourhood with a man after his heart. But he felt he could trust her implicitly, and if such men did not come up to her ideal he must look about for some of a different stamp ; perhaps comparison would bring her round to see their acceptability. When therefore he had received Lawrence's letter he had been grateful for the chance of enabling her to do so. He had taken a great fancy to Lawrence at their first meeting years ago ; he had been struck by his appearance and a certain dauntlessness about his expression, implying a courage and independence he had fancied was inseparable from a country life. And now that he had seen him again he had been confirmed in that favourable opinion. Besides, the knowledge that he had been his son's friend and had striven to help him, however unsuccessfully, weighed with him more than he would have been ready to confess and served to turn towards the young man the current of that fatherly interest which had lost its natural outlet. If Doris could see something to like, to admire, where he had liked and admired he should not be dissatisfied, to say the least of it ; and though he half suspected that Lawrence might also have been capable of some of the follies of youth, the lengths to which his own son had gone rendered"], [138, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 120 similar aberrations more pardonable now, in com parison. If it came to that what young man could he be certain of? For those he liked best as a class were perhaps more than all inclined to regard life with too little seriousness. Lawrence looked as if he had passed beyond the period when life seems something to be simply enjoyed. There was a thoughtfulness in his eyes. Marshlands more over had spoken highly of him. Yes, the Squire certainly liked him ; but he did not wish that to weigh with Doris for a moment. He merely wished to give her the benefit of the experience necessary for a proper estimate of men as they were ; and again he would rely upon her own judgment, know ing that it was never likely to be influenced by considerations of outward appearance or novelty of manner or conversation alone. Still it was early days to be planning and think ing over what might come of the introduction. Moreover he had yet to make certain himself. He felt he should like to see what Mrs. Salter's impres sions as a woman, upon whose good faith at all events and love for his daughter he could rely, might be. Perhaps they could be of service to him. So he suddenly startled that good lady after dinner, when Doris had left the room, by asking her straight out what she thought of Lawrence. Now Mrs. Salter had been quite overcome by Lawrence's behaviour at the picnic. True, it was easy for her to see that the entertainment of the children had not been his sole object ; but a man who could condescend to further what she conceived"], [139, "FATHER AND DAUGHTER 121 to be his object by such means was, she thought, very commendable and a very proper young man to cultivate altogether. There was a boyish eager ness too about him, very different from what she would have expected in a gentleman from London; who ought to have been, according to her, con temptuously amused if he wanted to display proper breeding. She liked him for its absence ; and could not have said why, breeding being always preferable to the simplicity of eagerness. Experience had rendered her diplomatic how- ever. \"I hardly know,\" she said. \"What do you, sir?\" She called Mr. Trepinnock \" sir \" out of habit, or because there was nothing else to call him. \" I think he's a good-looking manly fellow enough,\" said the Squire. \" I liked him from the first moment I clapped eyes on him at Cambridge, or I shouldn't have introduced him here.\" Mrs. Salter saw her way at once. \" I should think he might be reckless,\" she said. \" He looks so and I have no grounds for knowing what his principles are.\" To cast a doubt upon the Squire's discernment was to rouse him to defend it. She had looked at Lawrence and looked at Doris and seen consequently more than the Squire had. Lawrence seemed very preferable to the young men about who thought of nothing but riding and fishing and shooting, always excepting poor Mr. Wren. And for some reason or other Mrs. Salter had always looked with dissatisfaction upon the intimacy between Doris and him. She knew that he was a"], [140, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 122 very good man, but the possibility of Doris some day marrying him was distasteful, unaccountably. \" And how do you propose to find out what his principles are ? \" demanded the Squire. \" I only know that he did his best for my boy.\" \" Heaven preserve all young men from his worst,\" thought Mrs. Salter, though she said nothing. \"As for looking reckless, every self-respecting man looks reckless, though I should say indepen dent was the right word. I like a man who can look me in the face without flinching ; for if he does that I take it he can't be small or mean, and if he don't drink or gamble, or talk as if his father's religion was beneath him, he's got the foundations of a gentleman to build from ; and I don't know what more you'd expect.\" \" And what evidence have you that he neither drinks nor gambles ? \" thought Mrs. Salter, and said nothing again. \" See how our little parson struck up with him too. I'll back him to see through a chap,\" the Squire added in support. \" Yes,\" said Mrs. Salter, \" he can hop.\" \" I consider him an acquisition in the dull old place,\" said Mr. Trepinnock. This was of the nature of a tribute to the social demands of her, Mrs. Salter, and as such entirely acceptable. She knew the place was never dull to either Doris or her father. \"Yes, he is very pleasant and agreeable,\" she said. \" Well, I asked for your opinion, Mrs. Salter, but I can't say I consider you much the poorer. Never"], [141, "FATHER AND DAUGHTER 123 mind, let's go into the drawing-room.\" Mr. Trepin nock was in a huff. There they found Doris seated on the floor, sur rounded by a selection of open books. And she had been so absorbed in her examination of some of them that she had not noticed that Grabs had awakened from a snooze on the hearthrug, and sniffing the delicately delicious savour of whole-calf and morocco in the air, had come cautiously forward and begun doing full justice to the opportunity, after the manner of puppies with growing teeth to consider. \" Hullo ! \" cried the Squire, \" and what's my maid after now ? \" \" Only looking for a quotation I am sure I have read, and thought I knew where to find,\" she answered, flushing at their sudden interruption. \" Well, Grabs seems to have been doing his level best to help you. Here's a sight.\" And he picked up the hapless volume preferred of Grabs. \"Oh, Grabs!\" cried Doris all dismay; but Grabs' conscience was not there to be stirred, having already carried him well out of hearing. \" Oh, how horribly careless of me ! My precious books ! I should never have thought I could be so careless of a book ! \" \" I think,\" said her father, \"your particular sage would forgive you if he could be here to see your distress.\" \" As the binder would forgive Grabs his peculiar way of showing appreciation. He had some of a sort. That's about the value of mine.\""], [142, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 124 \" I'll dock his licence till he's paid for the re binding,\" said the Squire. She took the book; and turning over the leaves to estimate damages, suddenly stopped, and looking up at her father with dancing eyes cried : \" No you mustn't, for Grabs has just found me what I wanted. His ways of helping are rather expensive, but I'll forgive him now.\" \"That's right,\" said her father thoughtfully. \" Then you can pack them all away and come and beat me as usual at backgammon now.\" They carried her treasures back to the little glass-doored bookcase which the Squire had brought her all the way from Paris, and then sat down for an hour to draw the strings that bound their hearts together a little tighter over the old-fashioned game. Mr. Trepinnock had Darwin's luck, but Doris' triumph was not very difficult to submit to, for him. To night he suffered worse defeat than ever, and made as many blots as could only have been excusable in an opponent with a preference for the pleasure of watching her fingers gleefully take them up, and set them in a pile on the division, over that of making a table or winning the game. He got good humouredly impatient at last and retired to his study for a pipe before turning in, leaving her to take her damaged book upstairs with her and spend an hour in her own room pondering over Lawrence's reference to it and his difficulty in applying its teaching to his case. Then she went to bed with it tucked under her pillow, to dream all night that Lawrence was"], [143, "FATHER AND DAUGHTER 125 carrying her up a hill that seemed endless, while the stones made him stumble and tremble for fear of falling. Up and up she was borne helpless, and looking forward she saw a deep broad trench dug in the side of the hill ; but he went straight towards it never heeding, as if he could not see. She looked up into his eyes ; she knew that he was blind. She tried to cry out in warning, but she herself was dumb. And then he came to it, and with a horrible scream fell forward over the edge with herself in his arms. Crash, she awoke shuddering \u2014 to see the \"case ment grown \" more than \" a glimmering square,\" for the summer sun had risen. She got up \u2014 oh ! the blessed relief of awakening \u2014 and opened it to cool herself and breathe the \" woodbine spices wafted abroad \" from around it ; and then, after watching the rabbits, real sweet live rabbits, play ing over the grass among the dew down by the wood for a while, concluded like a wise little soul that she must have eaten a deal too much bun at the children's picnic yesterday afternoon. So she leaned down and picked a piece of the honeysuckle, and went back to bed to sniff it and read about Abbot Samson until the foolish horror of her dream had passed away and she felt she could safely go to sleep again."], [144, "CHAPTER IX PUZZLES AGAIN The next two days were blanks to Lawrence. He spent the morning and evening in trying to fish and the rest of the day in sketching ; and all the while he kept thinking of Doris and what she had said to him. Sometimes he half repented that he had con fided so much to her about the dreamy aimlessness of his life with its idleness and self-conscious struggles with self-consciousness, and grew quite ashamed of himself. And then again he felt glad that he had done so, glad that he had made no attempt to conceal his real self or be other than perfectly honest before her. Besides, he could not have helped himself. There are some people before whom concealment is impossible. If she would condescend to sympathise with him as he was she might be \u2014 what might she not be to him ? But if she would not he knew at least that there would be no hope of gaining her sympathy by hypocrisy. It had been so over and over again with him in his Cambridge days : men had failed and he had been driven back upon himself to mutter and grow"], [145, "PUZZLES AGAIN 127 weary. But she \u2014 she had not as yet shown a sign of the uneasiness which had always greeted his confidences before ; much less had she looked back at him with that slightly amused contempt which had so often exasperated him and driven him to think that perfect open-heartedness between man and man was impossible. Then he recalled her blush when he had dared to mention the word love before her. Could it be possible that a woman like that might love him ? Surely it would be enough for him if he could find one single human creature willing to listen and un derstand and perhaps help a little. That she could love him was incredible, or if credible then fearful, a thing to be trembled at, like the vision of the Holy Grail to those who were not fit to look thereon. On the Wednesday evening Mr. Wren appeared as he had promised. He found Lawrence moodily pacing the bridge : it was his favourite place when the day was over, for the little inn parlour was somewhat stuffy. There is always an interest in looking over a bridge \u2014 a sense of elevation \u2014 a possibility of things to be seen. Lawrence shook his hand warmly, and though as usual he would much have preferred having the evening to himself he was really very glad to see the little man. \" Come in and sit down,\" he said. \" No, thanks,\" said the parson, \" I'd prefer staying out here a bit, if it's all the same to you. It's jolly to sit here a night like this and listen to the river.\""], [146, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 128 \" Do you smoke ? \" asked Lawrence. Mr. Wren nodded. \" Well, let me go in and get you a cigar. I've some I rather fancy.\" \" Thanks, very much,\" said Mr. Wren. A good cigar did not come in his way every day of the year. So Lawrence fetched his cigar case and the parson lit up and soon found that he was not going to be disappointed. After a brief spell of enjoy ment he said : \" That was rather a novel sort of picnic we had the other day, wasn't it ? \" \" Yes,\" replied Lawrence, \" and a very good sort too.\" \" I don't know what the children about here would do without Miss Trepinnock,\" said the other. \"They simply worship her. She is always de vising some scheme or other to please them and keep them out of idleness and mischief.\" \" She must be a great help in your parish,\" said Lawrence rather dryly. He resented discussion of Doris, and knew he had no right to do so. \" Indeed she is, and so is Mr. Trepinnock too. Of course life here is very monotonous ; you'd call it dull to a degree.\" (\" No, I shouldn't,\" thought Lawrence.) \" But everything that can be done to arouse the people and keep them interested and amused too the Trepinnocks do. One of Miss Trepinnock's plans is to teach the children natural history and show them from the first what a won derful place this Dartmoor is.

The ordinary country boy is absolutely ignorant for instance about the ways of insects. He hardly ever feels any interest in noting the habits of any beast that is not worth to him the trouble of catching and killing. And as to beauty of scenery or interest in trees or plants or stones they are as blind and deaf as they were in the Middle Ages. Some time ago the Squire started a small museum here. We have now got quite a collection of stuffed things and curiosities. The boys are wonderfully keen about it. But you know the Trepinnocks. You can easily judge for yourself that the people round are not exactly creditors.\" \" Personally I know very little of the Trepin nocks,\" said Lawrence. \" I never saw Miss Tre pinnock until a few days ago. Her brother was a great friend of mine in Cambridge times. Did you know him ?\" \"No,\" said Wren. \"I think I saw him once, but he died abroad very shortly after I came here. It was a sad story. He lies buried in my church yard, as perhaps you know. His father went out to Monte Carlo to bring him back.\" They were silent. Presently Lawrence asked : \" Did it upset them very much ?\" \" I hardly know. I had not been here long enough to note any great change in them. They 1"], [148, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 130 had been very anxious about him for some time before it happened. The disgrace of it all was naturally very hard for a man like Mr. Trepinnock to bear. But never for a moment has it interfered with their good work here. The people round used to tell me that it changed Miss Trepinnock a good deal. Before she used to be very full of fun they said. But I think she is very full of fun still. With such a father and sister the son must have been right at bottom.\" \" Of course he was,\" grunted loyalty. \" What a stupendous thing,\" said the parson, \" that power of women ; and how they misuse it!\" \" Coventry Patmore ?\" suggested Lawrence. \" Yes, I was thinking of those lines. It would almost seem as if it was only evil women who ever do adequately grasp a notion of their power. To think of the power of that one woman over him !

I am no naturalist myself, but I believe it holds true in nature generally that all poisonous harmful things should produce an instinctive fear and disgust. We seem to have lost the right use of our instincts. But what makes me wild is to hear men abusing their instincts when they've degraded them. When a man does wake up to see his degradation, what does he do ? He just sets to work to find fault with his animal passions for being there instead of himself for misusing them : calls 'em a snare of the devil and abuses the Maker's laws.

Still we've got our teetotallers and other sorts of rabid abolitionists, decrying use and abuse together, still amongst us. They're very much alike. ' I've misused,' says one, ' and am consequently degraded ; use is therefore degrading.' Blind absurdity. But one sees one terrible fact looming through their talk : just this, that abuse blinds them against seeing the possibilities of right use. Abuse has rendered them incapable of right use or even appreciating its Tightness.\" \" It would almost seem so,\" said Lawrence. \" It's the inevitable consequence,\" said the parson. \"Just think; given a rake and repentance, what sort of feelings is he likely to have on his wedding day ? Think of the memories behind him, all the keener the deeper his repentance ! What is it pos sible for him to think ? He can't forget.

Just as inevitable that he should never be able to regard that as holy which he has known to be vile. He has put it out of his power to do otherwise. He cannot forget.\" \" You allow no healing virtue to the purity of his wife ? \" said Lawrence. The parson's talk began to grow uncomfortably appropriate. \" That would lead him to perfect his repentance. But he could never realise what he might have realised. Unless he could forget. And he could not forget. Still who can fathom that power of good women ? But the more perfect his repentance the keener and more bitter must be the sense of what he has missed. And many do not even wake up to that fully. There is for them a grossness left, of their own creation ; and that grossness they put down to the Maker's laws, and deform their very repentance.\" \" I prefer to believe the woman's power rather greater,\" said Lawrence. \" That is comfortable,\" said the parson. \" That is probably why I believe it,\" said Law rence, \" I suppose.\" \"Are you one of the cynics then?\" asked Wren. \" I hope net, but I'm sure I don't know.

No one ever seems to me to have reconciled the two halves of that verse. One sees the inevitableness of the first part clearly enough, and one can realise it keenly enough too ; but then comes the saving clause, which gives one a sort of hope. It may be all unreasonable for a fellow like me to say he believes it. I don't believe it really in the face of all I see going on round me ; but I want to, and think it's beautiful and all that. How do you explain it ? \" \"Well, I should begin,\" said the parson, \"by quoting that other one about entering heaven maimed or having one eye.\" \" Do you really believe in an imperfect heaven, then ? \" asked Lawrence. \" I believe the maimed can enter heaven.\" \"Although he can never forget. What's his heaven like if he can't forget ? \" \"Not what it might have been here.\" \" But I'm talking of hereafter. You say he can never forget.

That, according to you, necessitates a reinstatement. But how can he be reinstated if he is not made whole again ; if he is not made whole again how can he enter your heaven hereafter ? How can he be made whole again unless he is enabled to forget ? The difficulty to me in the text is just this (I'm not irreverent, at least I don't mean to be) : as .

One does confide in a comparative stranger occasionally most unexpectedly and fully. Perhaps it was his talk with Doris that had aroused him again. He longed to hurl his grievances at somebody's head. \" And when one's got the optimist tap on every one takes you for a blind enthusiast, pessimist for soured cynic. \" Then if one takes the trouble to examine things one finds it mere waste of time ; one doesn't get at 'em ; and if you go on without examining you just feel that you're attending to everything else but the one important thing.

And one sees that the men with the brains have mostly modified the divinity out of Christianity till it's quite uncertain how much there is left to believe in it except beauty and morality as approved by one's own inner sense, which accordingly gives it all the authority it has over one ; even where they have not denied it altogether. If I assume I ought to be a Christian because I'm born in a Christian country, I assume that other religions are quite as true ; and I might as well assume everything else about it without any more worry and bother.\" \" But you'd hardly expect me to admit want of brains in English bishops,\" said the parson. \" People are inclined to read one side only.\" \" And upon my word I believe it's the best way too,\" said Lawrence bitterly. \" Every one has something different to say and it all leads to"], [155, "PUZZLES AGAIN 137 confusion.

He fairly stared at the parson. But as he stared he saw that the question was nothing like so inconsequent as it sounded.

The parson's talk haunted him, Doris' talk haunted him, above all his own memories haunted him and struggled together in confusion. The parson was right : a man cannot forget. Dartmoor seemed as little likely to give him rest as the turmoil of town. Yet Dartmoor promised to give him, had already given him, a hope he had never known before. Here was a girl-woman accepting life as she found it, as a thing to be devoted to work and love, charity for all. And here was a man toil worn but enthusiastic, who had found reconciliation for all differences in that one truth that death and all that leads to death was to be struggled against for ever, that life, \" more life and fuller,\" was the crown, and all that led to life, that made a man fitter to live, was to be fought for and grasped at as each best might ; with the inevitable corollary that well-directed work was the weapon. And here too a day or two ago he had formed for himself a"], [160, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 142 resolution that he would become worthy to love Doris. That meant he must become worthy to live. All tended to the same conclusion : he must work. Stagnation and death lay in idleness. He must work. But the answer to the terrible question was no nearer, the question in what way he was to work. There was life-giving work to be done, and death dealing work or mere mischief to be done ; how was he to know them and choose ? When he came to think of it, it seemed that he had acknowledged all the conclusions Dartmoor had impressed upon him ; he had acknowledged them in an indefinite and ill-considered manner all his life. And yet he had not acted upon them. Were they now to have no more effect upon him than before ? Was he to sink back again into the passive stupor from which he was struggling to arise ? Never. But that question was to be answered, and answered soon, if he meant to shake it off. Oh, for some definite answer ! Oh, for some one to lead him and guide him, some one on whose judgment he could utterly rely, and throw the doubts and per plexities, in which his own poor brain involved him at every step, to the four winds and be free \u2014 free truly, by laying down the false liberty he had tried to come at and found to be the worse slavery of all \u2014 for ever ! How often had he tortured himself! How often had he examined himself, hoping to find guid ance from within instead of from without ; even after he had tacitly acknowledged the necessity of"], [161, "DIRECTION FOR THE PURPOSE 143 guidance from without by adopting this profession of his, going to the Bar, out of love for his father ! How often had he questioned and worried and striven to know whether that was the right thing to have done after all ! Natural capacities surely merited some consideration, perhaps more than \" some.\" At times he had thought he ought to have become an artist. Yet was there enough talent latent within him to justify the gift of his whole life to art ? If not, what then ? For the great critic had said that ' colour ' demanded no less than his whole life. And sometimes in sheer desperation he had begun to devise schemes for starting a small manufactory, on new principles as to share of profits and such like, turning this cum bersome capital into present realisation of dreams, dreams, dreams ; through them dancing in derision, the bogey of political economy, miscalled so or not, to entangle him and lead him astray and involve him in ever worse perplexity. Where was the good of trying to be anything or do anything or think anything in this scrambling, carping, finger pointing age ? And still he had sat on in his chambers in Lin coln's Inn out of what he imagined to be loyalty, a loyalty in reality fast degenerating into apathetic heartless fatalism. Work ! work ! work ! How was he to work ? With the soul gone out of him, and even the in terest of idle speculation dying down in him, like the fire that has burnt up all the fuel it feeds on ; with a heart all cooling to dust and ashes and"], [162, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 144 desolation. Like a bellows folly and sin had blown upon it to make the fire burn faster. And the books ! What guidance or comfort lay in the books ! That great essay on work to which he had alluded before Doris, what answer did that give him ? What remedy did that supply ? What was he to do ? The answer out of it was : \" At pre sent nothing ; you have forgotten God.\" How was he to find God ? Again the answer : \" I can give you no answer as to that ; I am no Morrison with his pills : laborare est orare.\" Work, work, yes work would arouse him to learn of God again and worship Him. But to know God was the necessary preliminary to right work. And so on in an end less circle : work, and you will know God : but you can do nothing until you know God : therefore you cannot work : therefore you cannot hope to know God. That was an answer ! Comfort ! Perhaps after all it was true that he might learn to know God by force of his own misery and wretch edness. To that supposition came the assurance : no man is truly religious until he feels no want of religion, or healthy until he knows not of his health ! Yes, he was very unhealthy, very irre ligious, and consequently horribly unhappy; and he saw no way out of it at all : unless, unless this air of the moor, this child of light and the moor would breathe upon him and inspire him, and teach him the very first rudiments of the science of life. Oh ! Doris, poor child ! What have you before you ? Even what you said to yourself : \" Just"], [163, "DIRECTION FOR THE PURPOSE 145 another man to be thrown away and wasted, all for want of a guide.\" Will you come down to him and help him ? Take this for your comfort that no man is utterly worthless who can love such as you truly. Next morning he arose early and went for a long walk, so that the wind might blow through him, and the sun beat down upon him, and the physical exercise generally make him fitter to meet the Squire and his daughter by lunch time. And, as was hardly to be wondered at considering his state of mind, he lost his way on the moor, and only just returned in time to receive them ; for they were punctuality itself. Doris' foot seemed perfectly well again. With a pretty feminine regard for her appearance she had dressed herself up in plain white, with a broad band of dark blue silk round her waist for a sash and a broad-brimmed curly straw hat set on the back of her head like a glory. Lawrence thought she looked more beautiful than ever ; but then he had not seen her for two whole days. The Squire seemed normally genial and hearty. Lawrence assisted them out of the little red dog cart, and escorted them into the inn parlour with all the delight in the world. \"I'm afraid you've been having bad weather for fishing, Mr. Westerton,\" said Doris. \" We haven't had any rain for a week.\" \" And doesn't look like as if we were ever going to have any more,\" added the Squire. \" I suppose you have been out drawing some of the things you said K"], [164, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 146 you meant to the other day, or you must have got precious dull \u2014 eh ? \" \"Yes,\" said Lawrence ; \"you shall see some of the splendid results after lunch if you like.\" \" May I take off my hat ?\" asked Doris. Oh, Doris ! mischievous Doris ! why do you ask that ? Lawrence naturally assented, outwardly conven tionally, inwardly how unconventionally. So she took off her hat in front of the glass, and then fell to examining the quaint ornaments on the mantelpiece, and all the small impedimenta which a man brings away with him from home, and leaves scattered about his sojourning places in the untidiest fashion. Her remarks thereon were charming. Then her curiosity extended to other parts of the room, and she looked at Lawrence's fishing-rod lying along the wall on the picture nails, and then at his books here and there ; and at last her eye caught sight of a certain piece of bent iron fencing standing up in a corner with his sticks and umbrella. He had come back too late to tidy up, and had forgotten all about it. She looked away directly pretending she had not seen and caught Lawrence's eye pretending that he had not seen her pretence, and her inquisitiveness stopped straightway and she sat down in the arm chair, hardly knowing whether to laugh or not. Fortunately lunch arrived at that moment in the shape of a stringy roast chicken and a tinned tongue, accompanied by a dish of green vegetables that in stantly filled the room with that repellent hot steam peculiar to boarding-houses on Sundays. Lawrence looked and sniffed and laughed outright."], [165, "DIRECTION FOR THE PURPOSE 147 \" I'm afraid it's not very appetising,\" he said. \" I never ordered cabbage ; I mean I forgot to forbid it.\" \" Never mind,\" said the Squire, \" I dare say I can manage some.\" Lawrence set to work to combat the chicken at one end, and the Squire cut the tongue in quarter inch slabs at the other. Doris sat between and helped them both and herself too to the unforbidden. After that Lawrence felt happier. The Squire certainly had a wonderful appetite, and there was not much left when they had had enough ; for he ate the two legs, and Doris one wing and Lawrence the other. The breast, what there was of it, went into shreds and became lost in the general wreck ; which is the usual fate of the breasts of Dartmoor chickens. They have no in dividuality. After that came some pale stewed pears, suggestive of tins and America, and Mrs. Baker's best attempt at a jelly, of a syrupy con sistency ; and then a Stilton cheese, which was evidently kept for State occasions. Lawrence had not seen it before, and the memory of the greens immediately faded into insignificance beside its awful pungency. After the Squire had helped himself it had to be taken away to its own peculiar treasure house again. Lawrence almost wished he had not asked them. The food had hitherto seemed excel lent ; he could not imagine why it appeared so common and unsuitable now. \" I think it will be pleasanter outside,\" he said when the Squire at last declared himself \" done"], [166, "148 LA WRENCE WESTERTON beautifully;\" and as that was sufficiently obvious he caught up two chairs and carried them to the shadow that overhung one end of the bridge. Then he brought out some cigars for the Squire, and the sketches for them both to look at. Strangely enough he never thought of smoking himself. The sketches comprised two of a panoramic character, one of the spot on the river where he had met Doris, another rocky bit of river, a view of Crocodile Tor, and the facsimile of the inn. They were not particularly beautiful, being all outline, suggesting traces from photographs ; but they were very finely and faithfully done. Law rence's style was pencil outlines with a gradated wash or two of monochrome, and he had not had time to do much finishing. The Squire, however, recognised all the places at once and declared them first-rate ; and Doris, though she could not understand why Lawrence should care about such minute work, appreciated their honesty and precision, and especially the almost filigree-like fineness of the lines. Presently the little maid came out to them with some coffee. \" If you please, Mister Trepinnock,\" she said, \" Farmer Buckle came by as you were lunching, and hearing you were here said as if you were to be so good as to drive down this afternoon after them ponies of his he would be in and very glad to let you see 'em.\""], [167, "DIRECTION FOR THE PURPOSE 149 \" I daresay he would,\" was the Squire's first com mentary. \" Perhaps I will later.\" Then an idea seemed to occur to him, and he called th2 maid back. \" Ask Joe,\" he said, \" to put the pony into the cart in ten minutes ; \" and then added, turning to Lawrence : \" Excuse me, Westerton, but Buckle's is hardly on the way home. If you don't mind I'll just drive down now and pick Doris up on the way back.\" This was an entirely acceptable solution of the difficulty. \" Half an hour or more with Doris alone ! \" thought Lawrence. The Squire's trap was brought round within a quarter of an hour (which was good, for Joe), and Mr. Trepinnock, in spite of his outspoken declaration that he felt ready to drop off to sleep every minute, was off down the road. Lawrence returned to the bridge and sat down on the road with his back against the wall a little apart from Doris. She was looking through the drawings again. She liked the river scenes best she said, and began studying his first one attentively. \" I suppose that's meant for me,\" she said un affectedly, referring to the partially obliterated figure standing in the water. \" You should have left it in.\" \" So I would have done,\" he answered, \" if it had been the least bit like you. But I never can draw people or manage the folds of drapery, or trees, or anything of that sort. The only things I can attempt to draw are rocks and mountains and buildings, things that are comparatively unchanging and have sharply defined edges to them. Things"], [168, "150 LAWRENCE WESTERTON that do not keep a definite set shape for two minutes together are impossible to me, and end in doubt and feebleness ; I get mad and tear them up. I have set myself ever so many times to draw a single flower, but the thing grows and bends and changes even while I draw it, and the proportions get wrong directly. I'm rather put to it in consequence to find anything I can draw. There aren't man}* trees on the moor here and the lines of the hills are hard and comprehensible. I have got on a little better. Things generally do look a bit clearer here. I have found a definition or two.\" \" And what makes you so intent on defini tions ?\" \" Because one likes having something firm and fast to start from ; something that won't look dif ferent when you've turned to look at something else for two seconds. One can't think or do any thing else without definitions, and yet definitions are the hardest things in the world to come by. And when one does find one, one can never be certain of its being correct. Then, if it isn't, down come all your theories with a run, and off you go again with another.\" \" Why ? \" \" Oh, I don't know why,\" he said almost savagely ; \" because one is cursed with an uncom fortable distracting blob of grey and white matter one pays oneself the compliment of calling brains, I suppose.\" \" I believe that way of testing definitions is a very old logical way,\" she said, \" taking them"], [169, "DIRECTION FOR THE PURPOSE 151 for granted, so to speak, and then if they lead to a clearly false conclusion rejecting them and taking others.\" \" Yes, and one may spend one's life doing it.\" \"And never hit upon a single right one even then.\" \" Aye, but,\" he laughed, \" where would all the speculation be if you never hit upon a wrong one?\" \" But after all it is a trite saying that specula tion only shows us how much we cannot know but only guess at, and that the philosophers have never succeeded in doing more than ask pertinent ques tions. But now, Mr. Westerton, I have read through that book you quoted from the other day, and I really cannot see how you managed to escape find ing your answer to the question you mentioned.\" \" I am dense, I think I explained. It seems to teach one that one has got to arrive at a certain state of mind before one can do much else and that one don't stand much chance of getting into that particular state of mind for some time.

Of course it means that one ought to stir one's conscience round and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 see what happens then.\" \" Well to me it says something besides that \u2014 I may be easily satisfied ; I daresay I am.

Any young man thinks he can be self sufficient if he likes, and find things out for him self; but God knows I am tired of it enough by this time ; and now I can't set to work to mix with other people just to get out of myself, and carry about a conventional grin like any clothes horse among them.

Why not mix with them for their sakes, not your own ?\" \" At least I am not quite so vain,\" he replied, \" as to think that I, who cannot help myself in the smallest real vital matter that comes before me, could be of the slightest service to any one else, except maybe as something like the old Court fool, with his bitter-sweet and payment of kicks and mockery, for them to amuse themselves with.\" \"What are you saying?\" she cried. \"You think you could do no good, be of no use in the world. Why I am vainer, if you call it so, than that.

All the doubts and difficulties which had forced themselves upon his attention during the last few days so violently, bringing with them a horrible dread that through this very shirking and parrying, which he inwardly admitted, and efforts to escape them instead of manfully standing up to face them, in a way he inwardly admitted also was the only right way, he had precluded himself from taking advantage of a blessing even now almost within his reach, and must appear wanting before her, in whose sight, if in no one else's, he so longed to look like a man \u2014 all his pent-up feelings of vexation and remorse found vent in a sudden and uncontrollable burst of bitterness. He flushed to the roots of his hair. \" If you think that, Miss Trepinnock,\" he said, \" my wonder is that you can consider it worth while to sit here and talk to one who must seem so entirely worthless and contemptible.\" He could have torn his tongue out directly after wards. He would have done anything rather than have spoken so. He looked up, sullen and shame faced, and saw that her eyes were wide open with wonder and pain. She dropped them a moment afterwards, and said coldly : \" I am impertinent in fact, Mr. Westerton. But you should not have let me imagine that I was at liberty to take an interest in you.

She was beginning to see, to recognise what his sudden outburst signified ; a mind strug gling after something it was on the verge of despair about finding, and paradoxically defying the very help it would be only too glad to take, goaded against friend and foe alike. She was determined to make the most of it. She plucked a broad blade of grass beside her"], [174, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 156 and began leisurely tearing it into strips length wise. \"We must all take an interest of some sort in each other,\" she said calmly, \" unfortunately.

That is enough. They will teach you more than you will ever learn by sitting down to think. Those London children, who have nothing of all this,\" and she waved her hand towards the moor, \" give them a little of it. Take them into the country. And do not do it by cheque,\" and her upper lip drew up contemptuously. \" Give them something besides your money. Take them yourself.\" He did not answer at once. She noticed his long bony fingers grown white with the force of his clenching. \" Thank you, Miss Trepinnock,\" he said at last in a quiet, solemn voice. \" That thing I will do.\" His eyes passed slowly from the road up to her own. There was a steady, almost stony earnestness in them. Oh ! Doris, Doris, it is all over, all fixed and set out before you now. You have chosen. You can see you have chosen. You have set yourself to be the guide to this wanderer. Are you wise ? \" Mr. Westerton,\" she said presently, \" when the time comes it will be very different from what you think now.

Those words from that time forward became his motto, written on his heart, sacred. From his lips they never passed but upon one other occasion. He felt even now that he had entered upon a new phase, a new country ; that this solemn oath marked a change effected in him, bore witness to an altera tion in his life. He was longing to thank her more, yet afraid to do so. He felt her to be above the need of thanks ; that his only possible thanks would require time, long time, to show. As for taking advantage of the interest she had acknowledged she took in himself that was quite out of the question after what she had said. To have told her that it was for her own sweet sake he had given that pro mise would have been utterly mean and con temptible. What he had asked for she had given in spite of his unmannerly boorishness. How could he dare to ask for more now ? He sat silent, longing to thank her. And she was thinking very solemnly to herself over what she had said and what the saying of it implied. Not that she would have unsaid it for the world. But she recognised that it involved nothing less than herself. If he could do this thoroughly, if he could do this, if he could conquer his indolence and selfishness, there was something behind, something high and great ! She saw that"], [178, "LA WRENCE WESTERTON 160 he would do it, she had read it in his eyes, in the clenching of his hands, and \u2014 she loved him. May I quote from Kingsley ? He says : \" It is an old jest \u2014 the fair devotee trying to convert the young rake. Men of the world laugh heartily at it ; and so does the devil, no doubt. If any readers wish to be fellow-jesters with that personage they may ; but as sure as old Saxon woman-worship remains for ever a blessed and healing law of life, the devotee may yet convert the rake \u2014 and perhaps herself into the bargain ! \" Doris, however, was not a devotee, nor, as far as I know, in need of conversion, and Lawrence was not, as far as I know also, a rake ; so the quotation is not very appropriate after all ; still per haps applicable, since the greater includes the less. And how far woman's pity for strength thrown away, quickened by the consciousness of her own power to raise it if she but will, can go towards the making of a woman's love is a question about which \u2014 there is not much difference of opinion really. At last she said : \" In my opinion triumphs of intellect, whether reckoned by results of actual thinking or by results we call honour, satisfaction of ambition, least of all accumulation of money, are just a means to enable a man to do the great thing, nothing more really ; though it sounds a platitude to say so. We do not admit so many platitudes in these times. It is surprising how little has been done by it except where that was the first object ; or perhaps not so surprising.\""], [179, "DIRECTION FOR THE PURPOSE 161 \" And what is the great thing ? \" asked Law- rence. \" There, I have told you quite enough,\" she said. \" Take those children out into the country.\" The wheels of the dog-cart returning with the Squire put an end to Lawrence's inquiries, for the time at all events. They both got up to meet him. \" What are they like ? \" asked Doris brightly. \" Well they aren't a pair to begin with,\" said the Squire ; \" and as that makes 'em perfectly useless at once there's no need to say I wouldn't give as much for both of 'em together as old Buckle asks for either ; so that's all about it.

Mr. Wren received him with the greatest satisfaction and conducted him to what did duty for a village green, beside which the village public-house stood. The Totleigh men had already begun to arrive in various gigs and carts ; and a ragged old tent had been erected for the accommodation of the aged rustic who had volunteered to act as scorer. There was the usual sprinkling of semi-interested villagers about with a member of the county constabulary to refer to if occasion required, and consequently everything in readiness that was absolutely essential. Mr. Wren's team, however, was one short ; but that disadvantage was speedily rectified by one of the representatives of Totleigh volunteering to take four innings instead of the normal quantity, and to field out for both"], [182, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 164 sides indiscriminately the rest of the time. He was an ardent cricketer. Mr. Wren won the toss ; and he and Joe Baker were the first to stand up against the bowling, which was Totleigh's particular pride and glory. Mr. Wren was certainly not fitted naturally for membership of the Marylebone Club, and the loss of the two fingers of his left hand handicapped him rather unfairly besides. He made a most tremendous pull for three off the first ball, was clean bowled by the second, and came back to the tent in despair. Village cricket matches are so much alike that I do not propose to enter upon any very elaborate account of the present one. The Squire's under-gardener succeeded Mr. Wren, in a state of extreme nervousness; and he and mine host of the \" Three Foxes \" poked about for a good quarter of an hour, to allow of Joe's recovering his wind after the fearful exertion the parson's first pull had necessitated, and the score slowly rose to 7 ', when the under-gardener was run out, or rather ran himself out. He made a small cut to the off and called loudly to Joe to turn it into a run. Owing however to Joe's uncertainty as to his ability to cross in time and his final abandonment of the idea when the other was well out of his ground, the run was not only never added but the gardener himself subtracted, to his immense dis satisfaction. Then Lawrence came in, and taking his cue from Joe steadied himself for an over or two, for the bowling was certainly not wholly"], [183, "A LETTER AND A CHECK 165 despicable. But he soon found himself at home, and by lunch-time had knocked up 25 to the land lord's seven singles. Mr. Wren began to think that matters were im proving as he cut up the cold boiled beef at one end of the long table of the little public-house at which both elevens were seated ; an opinion in which Joe, who had taken the post of honour beside him, was so good as to coincide. He had seen two wickets fall since he had gone in, so felt more than justified in his remarks ; and even ventured to allude to Lawrence's performance in a patronisingly com placent manner that amused Lawrence more than it did two of the Squire's grooms, who sat opposite, and irritated the under-gardener beyond endurance. But Joe was not to be silenced, and on hearing certain objectionable whispers as to his conduct of the morning passing between the said grooms and under-gardener, entered upon a long and irrelevant defence of the same, with occasional appeals to the good sense of the company and Lawrence in par ticular for support, till Mr. Wren had to interfere to prevent the discussion growing quite acrimonious. When they turned out again Lawrence was delighted to see that Doris had come down to look on, accompanied by Mrs. Salter, Grips and Grabs, Collie and the two setters ; and had time to ex change a word or two with them, and to note that Doris looked very merry and Mrs. Salter very vigilant, before he went in again with the good wishes of both to back him, and the happy con sciousness of interested spectators of his prowess"], [184, "166 LAWRENCE WESTERTON to quicken it. It is very good to hit before a woman. The self-important Joe Baker was bowled first ball ; an accident concerning which he immediately set to work to assign reasons to the whole field, till they openly derided him. He was succeeded by the groom Lawrence had met under circum stances already related. He seemed to have some rather better notions of the game than his prede cessors. Moreover the bowling had not been improved by lunch, so that after making a small hit or two the man grew confident, and made a very decent partner. Lawrence and he scored about evenly till at length the first hundred was announced (not by telegraph), and the onlooking villagers grew enthusiastic. Then he retired with conscious pride and 40 runs to his credit, leaving Lawrence to hit about the Totleigh pride and glory in a way that was very mortifying to the same, while the other groom and then the villagers, who formed the tail end of the home team, came and stood at the other wicket and went away in turn discomfited and crestfallen. Lawrence slashed away to make as much of the time as he could, and was just feeling sure of carrying out his bat when heartless fate came in the shape of a lob which took his middle stump quite cleanly out of the ground. He had made 91, and the village received him with an ovation in which the representative of the county constabulary took a very prominent part, as there seemed nothing else on hand for him to do ;"], [185, "A LETTER AND A CHECK 167 and the Squire, who had come down by this time, slapped him on the back and openly declared that Joe Baker himself could not have done the like even in his best days ; a declaration which Joe received in silence, but with as much inward re servation as was to be expected. When the tumult had subsided Lawrence went and lay down on the grass by Doris and Mrs. Salter, praying and hoping that the last wicket might hold out for at least ten minutes. But it only held out two, the innings closing for 157, and he was haled out to field, to his great disgust, leaving Mrs. Salter's vigilance to exercise itself at long range. Wren began bowling at one end, very fast and very wide, with every energy thrown into every ball ; and after a bit Lawrence took the other with slow twisters and had the satisfaction of getting five wickets and applause from the Squire's party for every one of them. Alas ! Lawrence. Was a follow-on, of all things, to be desired under the circumstances ? You forget that most of the afternoon will be gone, and some one with it, by the time you get to the end of that. As indeed happened. Between Totleigh's two innings, how ever, the Squire came and asked both him and Mr. Wren up to Barrowdown to dinner on the following evening. There was considerable con solation in that. Totleigh's second innings lasted till close upon seven o'clock ; they had only made 45 in their first. But in the second they pulled up a bit,"], [186, "168 LAWRENCE WESTERTON perhaps in consequence of Doris' departure in the middle ; for after that Lawrence grew savage and adopted the parson's style instead of his own ; the result of which was close upon 20 byes in half an-hour. However they were all dismissed at last for 79, and the home team declared victorious, after some intricate calculations on the part of the aged rustic, by an innings and 33. Mr. Wren was delighted ; and the Totleigh men were moder ately good-humoured considering. For after all with Lawrence's 91 subtracted \u2014 and they felt that they might exclude his share in their defeat in forming general comparisons, besides making some allowance for his bowling \u2014 they had not been ignominiously beaten. So they all drank his health and then departed as they came ; and Lawrence, after declining Mr. Wren's invitation to stay to supper at the vicarage, walked up with Joe Baker to the \" Three Foxes,\" and had to listen to a long account of that worthy's remarkable past cricketing experiences all the way. He did not go into his sitting-room when he got back, but hearing that dinner was ready for him went straight up to his bedroom to change. When at last he came down, tired and hungry, he found not only his dinner ready but also a letter, bearing the Plymouth postmark, lying beside it on the table. It was a very ordinary-looking letter, directed in a rather stiff feminine hand-writing, with nothing about it seemingly to make Lawrence stare as he did.

He never moved ; he did not swear again ; he did not tear it up or kick the furniture ; he simply grew rigid, and stared at the tinted paper as if it was a warrant for his execution. The little maid Polly came in presently with the pudding, and found him standing there on the hearthrug, his dinner untouched. \"When did this come ?\" he asked, pointing to the envelope. \" Twelve o'clock, sir.\" \" When does the post go out ? \" \"It's gone, sir; at five o'clock.\" \" Can I send a telegram from here ? \" \" It's no use before the morning now, sir.\" \" Can I get to Plymouth to-night ? \" \" No, sir ; not by train, I think.

There was no train possible. \" How far is it to Plymouth by road ? \" he asked her. \" I don't quite know,\" she replied. \" Do you think I could get to Plymouth by road to-night ? I must get to Plymouth to-night.\" The girl fairly stared. \" I'll ask Mrs. Baker,\" she said, and went out again. So that \" infernal \" cricket match had prevented his getting his letter in time to write or telegraph,"], [189, "A LETTER AND A CHECK 171 and unless he could prevent it Violet would come \u2014 here ! Polly came back with Mrs. Baker confounded. It was just possible to reach Plymouth before morning, she said ; that was if Joe could get the pony trap up to the Cross Roads in time to catch the carrier's cart that passed through at nine. If he could do that Lawrence might reach Ply* mouth by three or four next morning ; but he was never going to spend his night on the road, and go without his dinner, &c. &c. \"Ask Joe to put the pony in at once,\" said Lawrence ; \" I'll try it.\" Then he looked out in Bradshaw to see which way Violet would come. If he missed the carrier's cart he might yet be able to meet her in the morn ing and send her back from the station on some pretext or other. Alas ! there were three or even four routes by which she might come. She might come round by train south of the moor up to Ashford, he found ; but from his letter it seemed rather as if she was going back from there and coming by some other route ; or round by the west of it and drive from Tavistock, or even Okehampton ; or as seemed most probable she might come up to Princetown and drive from there. It would be a long drive, though not so long as two of the others ; and it was the straightest way after all.

They got off at last, but Joe was quite hopeless from the first. Indeed they never reached the Cross Roads till 9.30, with the pony all in a lather, and Joe con sequently supremely indignant at the folly of the expedition altogether. Lawrence kept his temper, and bade Joe go home alone : he himself would walk back. He wanted to think. Baffled, and badly. He would do what he could to prevent Violet's coming, but if he missed her in the morning there was no help for it. Not that he thought so much of any danger to himself in her coming ; it would be quite possible with luck to prevent any one he cared about from knowing who she was, or even that she had been there at all. But the notion of her forcing her presence into the place that was so holy to him was unutterably horrible. It was that that made him so wildly anxious to prevent her coming, a real seeling of dread for the defilement which his own folly and forgetfulness had rendered possible and was likely to bring upon it. What a fool he was not to have written to Violet and paved the way for explanations as to his intentions before ! What a fool ever to give her permission to follow him about like this ! What a fool to have forgotten even that he had done so ! How sickening it was ! What a fool \u2014 what a more than fool ! Suppose he did miss her in the morning, what would be the best thing to do ?

And now the realisa tion of the utter vileness of his connection with Violet Vane came upon him in all its force, and he felt as if he was going mad.

He'll get over it in time, like the rest of 'em.\" All the same she was very mortified to think that the said sentimental simplicity should have rendered him impassible towards all the attractions of toilette and the rest which she had been at the pains to render as captivating as possible for his especial delight, and that the beauty he had bent before and adored should have grown nothing to him in so short a time. Her power was slighted. \" And when is it to be ? \" she asked. \"When is what to be ? \" \" Why your marriage, of course,\" she replied, in a tone of amused contempt. \" I am not going to be married.\" \u00ab Oh ! \u2014 ? \u2014 ! \" Lawrence fairly gasped at all the suggestion conveyed by that single \" oh ! \" \" What do you mean ? \" he said fiercely. \" How dare \" He stopped short. Had he not given her the right to make such an insinuation, any insinua tion ? Then he went on in desperation, turning to the first thing he could think of : \" Come tell me something more about Archie.\" \" Why should you ask about Archie,\" she replied, \" when you do not choose to let me into any of"], [202, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 184 your own little secrets ? Haven't I told you enough ? Still, I will if you like, for I do not allow my acquaintances to interfere with my friendship for old friends,\" she said pointedly, \"even when they fail to respect my feelings.\" \" Think of mine also then, please, and respect them.\" \" So I did,\" she said ; \" I began to take quite a friendly interest in this new flame of yours.\" He clenched his hands behind his back, and walked on in silence, counting the wheel tracks on the road before him. How could he speak of these things to this woman, how could he explain ? It was horrible. Yet all the chivalry within him told him that as a woman she had a right to explanation. That made it the more horrible. He had given her the right ; what a right ! They came to a cross road and went a little way along it. \"We'd better be turning back again now,\" he said presently. Chance ! was it chance that had brought him on to the road leading from the village to Barrowdown ? \" Perhaps this is her,\" she said as they turned, and pointed forward. He looked up and saw a lady riding towards them. Even at that distance he recognised her, and if ever fear fell upon Lawrence Westerton it fell upon him then as he did so. He was not without presence of mind, but this encounter would be one in which presence of mind was not of the slightest service. If it had been"], [203, "A MEETING 185 the devil riding down upon him he could have played the man perchance, but as it was an angel of light he could only long to flee away and hide himself ; and flight was impossible. \" Why it is her,'' cried Violet, as she looked and saw his face. \"I am going to see one lion or lioness after all.\" Lawrence could have murdered her for that short speech. He set his teeth and waited ; and Violet waited too, fully prepared to enjoy herself at his discomfiture. On came Doris, riding up from the school. She recognised Lawrence and waved her whip at him. He hoped that at least she might have passed with out stopping to speak. But she reined in her pony as she drew near, and he raised his head with the hopeless still defiant glare of a beast at bay. But he never listed his hat, he could not. For a moment all sorts of dastardly notions surged up in his brain, of pretending that Violet was a relative or something of that sort. Infamy ! He forced them down and strung himself to endure as best he might. Doris stopped opposite them and said good-day in a hesitating voice, rather scared at the strange absence of greeting. He answered never a word. She looked at him, and then at Violet, and then hard back at Lawrence ; and as she looked she blushed crimson. The veriest simpleton might have read his secret in the hunted, agonised expression of his glaring eyes. She lifted the pony's head with a jerk and set off at a smart trot down the road. When she reached"], [204, "186 LAWRENCE WESTERTON the corner, however, that hid her from their sight, she lashed him into a gallop and never paused until she reached Barrowdown. Lawrence's eyes followed her to the turn, all his hope of Heaven flying with her. He heard the pony break into a gallop, and understood. And then he looked at Violet, and even she sobered when she saw his face. \" Good seat, not ugly either ; but no manners,\" she said, still striving to be flippant. \" Silence ! \" His voice was tight and dry and piercing as a parrot's. \" Come home.\" As they walked back Violet began to think that his discomfiture had not been quite so amusing as she had anticipated and grew rather frightened. His head was bent down and his back rounded, and his usual air of jaunty nonchalance clean gone. His lips were perfectly bloodless and his face all pinched and drawn. As she looked at him she thought him almost ugly and deformed. He recalled pictures of the wandering Jew. When they arrived at the inn he went straight to the stables, roused up the flyman, helped him to put the horse in ; then went upstairs, brought down all Violet's belongings and packed them into the fly, and finally came into the sitting-room, whither she had fled, with her dust cloak in his hands. In the same parrot-like voice he said : \" Are you ready ? \" She thought he would have flung the cloak in her face. Instead of that he held it up as if to put it round her."], [205, "A MEETING 187 \" Your pardon, Miss Vane,\" he said quite gently. \" You must go at once ; and in going I would have you understand that it must be for good and all.\" The action was so unexpected and the change in his voice so sudden that she hardly realised the meaning of the words. She turned her back to the cloak and whispered over her shoulder as he folded it around her : \" My God, Lawrence ! But I am sorry for you.\" \" Sorry, sorry,\" he repeated quaveringly. \" Poor child, why should you be sorry, at least for this ? Her name is Miss Trepinnock.\" What an effort! \" You ought to know. Good-bye ; and God help you.\" >\u2022 He assisted her into the fly, just waited till she drove off, then came back into the parlour, sat down and buried his face in his hands. It was all over then. His resolutions had been vain. His gropings towards the dawn had been baffled and turned aside. The darkness had settled down upon his life once for all, never again to be lightened, and the cool breath of Heaven had fainted away before the pursuing desert-blast of his own misdeeds. There was nothing left but to flee, flee away at once and hide himself. Remorse cannot be anything but selfish at first. He got up with a groan and rang the bell. Mrs. Baker answered it herself. Mrs. Baker's eyes seemed indignant. \" I am sorry to have to cut my stay short,\" he said in a husky voice, \" but I am obliged to return to London to-morrow.\""], [206, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 188 Mrs. Baker broke out into a torrent of regrets. He held up his hand to stop her. \" Will you please see that my things are all packed ?\" he said. When she had gone, he sat down again and thought. The scarlet of Doris' face, there was no misreading- that. Yet how had she guessed so quickly ? Violet was not vulgarly though rather extravagantly dressed, and did not carry her character written upon her face so clearly that the eyes of a pure girl should have recognised it at once. But she had not blushed when she looked at Violet. It was his own face that had betrayed him ; and no wonder, he thought, as he realised his agony when he met her eyes. And now he must never meet those eyes again ; it would be an insult to her to think of doing so. There was no help for it : he must go. Self began to admit of other considerations. The Squire's invitation, what of that ? He was to have gone up to dinner with them to-night. He could write, of course, and excuse himself in some conventional way, and bid them good-bye with a lie ; of regret for the unforeseen ! Despic able ! Yet he took up his writing things and sat down to the table to try and frame some sort of apologetic excuse. She would see and overlook that lie ; by comparison. Would she ? Was he to offer no explanation, make no real apology, but leave her to think the very worst of him ? Leave her to think that he"], [207, "A MEETING 189 was so base as to have lived a continued insult before her, and had fled simply because he had been found out. He could not do it. Should he write to her own self ? That seemed feasible until he began to try to do it. ' Dear Miss Trepinnock ' was impossible. Perhaps he might be able to address her in the third person. He made three attempts, and gave it up in despair. He got up and paced the room for a while. Then he sat down, carefully lit a pipe, and tried to be calm and collect his scattered senses. He must use all his powers to deal rightly with this question. The other considerations began to submerge self. He must go, certainly ; but also he began to see that he must do something before he went. If he went without a word all she would be able to think would be this \u2014 that he had come into her presence, talked to her, even asked for her sym pathy and help, with an earnestness and desire to look well in her eyes, which must now seem to have been nothing but hypocrisy, mockery, and outrage, with no intention whatever of abandoning the indolence and folly and vice of his old life, even while he pretended he was longing to do so, or of allowing her purity and goodness to affect him in the slightest degree : and then when his infamy was by chance bared before her, had left her to realise how vile a man could be without showing a trace of contrition or remorse."], [208, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 190 Flight without a word might show he was ashamed, that he was conscious of guilt. But it is the meanest kind of shame that can find expression in nought else. Yet he could not write, and to see her was to add to the insult. He thought and thought. His pipe went out. Yes, to see her would be an insult; but if he saw her he might be able to prove that the rest of his conduct had not been an insult, that he had not been a hypocrite, that his earnestness had been real and no shallow pretence, that her goodness had affected him so deeply as to change his whole man ner of life. Surely, if he could persuade her of all this, he could make amends to some extent ; and if she would believe him she might pardon him just for daring to approach her once again for this purpose alone. Yet what would she think of him when she saw him come ? What mattered it what she thought of him now. He must throw himself out of the question and do what was right and just towards her. And it was not right to leave her to feel that such an infamous outrage as she must think he had offered her was possible for any man on earth. It was the choice of two wrongs that seemed laid before him, and he chose the less. He would go up and ask her to allow him to make some explanation. If she refused he would be no worse off; he could be no worse off than he was."], [209, "A MEETING 191 Still, still, the more he pondered the more un settled he grew again. Nothing that he could do would really wipe away the stain upon him. Why seek to make it ever so little lighter ? The speak ing of such matters before her was appalling to think of. But the wrong to her \u2014 it must be wrong, vilely wrong, to weaken her faith in her own power for good, and give her the bitterness of feeling that it was just worth nothing at all to cope with any real human evil ; that it inspired so little reverence in him that he could even introduce his degradation within the very borders of her home. Anything but that. She would surely see why he came, not for mercy \u2014 mercy, the idea ! \u2014 but to make it plain to her that her purity was not this absolute nothing, that her goodness had not been thrown away. Came a devil and asked : would she not know all this without his explaining it ? Would she in her nobleness be likely to think he had gone simply because his baseness had been discovered ? Surely she would look deeper than that and appreciate his motives. Was it not right simply to efface himself from her memory as swiftly and completely as possible ? No, no. He must prevent the very possibility of her thinking herself so contemptuously disregarded, so deeply wronged as that. It was mere cowardice after all to shirk the only mitigation that was possible for him. If he went without a word he would admit every thing her judgment warranted her in believing"], [210, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 192 against him. There was a certain nobility in that to be sure, of a self-conscious theatrical kind. But the true nobility, if any was to be found, seemed to him to lie not in confessing \" I am vile : think your worst of me,\" but in this, \" I am vile, but by the mercy of Heaven and your true self I know how vile too well to allow a single human creature, least of all your true self, to think me viler,\" a confession implying more real appreciation of the evilness of evil than any mock-heroic self-abandonment in the world. That is your power. Yes, he would go up and tell her this, this only, and go, It would be far more difficult to face her with such an explanation than to run away. Any man can run away when he is afraid, if he still have legs to carry him. But to stay and meet her was hard ; how hard Lawrence began to see as soon as he had fully made up his mind to do so. But that only confirmed him in his resolve. Just because it was the more difficult thing to do the more determinedly did he set himself to do it. He went up wearily to his bedroom, and assisted Polly to pack up his clothes. By the time they had finished it was getting late, and if he meant to go up to the Squire's he must dress. \" I am sorry you have to go away so soon, sir,\" said Polly simply.

He had had no breakfast that morning ; in fact, he had not had a decent meal since lunch at the cricket match the day before, and the strain he had undergone since, together with his almost sleepless night, had weakened him terribly. And yet, worn-out as he was, he had still the severest ordeal to pass through. When he came to the lodge gates he felt as if for very want of strength he must put off his attempt at explanation till to-morrow, and turn back again. To-morrow he would be fitter to make it. With a curse upon his cowardice he opened the gate,slammed it after him, and walked on down the avenue. Would she be alone ? He must see her alone for one moment. If she were not alone his task would be doubly difficult, a thousandfold more difficult. Yet if she were alone \u2014 how he dreaded to meet her ! And the Squire, what of him ? He had not thought what he should do when he met him : he had only thought of Doris."], [213, "EXPLANATION 195 Blessed, dreaded vision ! When he came to the lawn he saw her standing, alone, leaning with her elbows upon the stone balustrade at the edge of the terrace, looking down towards the woods below. He strode across the grass and wished he had kept to the drive ; for the grass deadened the sound of his coming feet. He seemed to be taking her unawares. But when he reached the steps she heard him, and turned with a start. He uncovered his head, and forced himself up them, and then raising his eyes he looked her straight in the face. So will the felon look on his judge between verdict of guilty and sentence. It is not audacity. She did not blush nor turn pale. She did not move a step forward or backward. He had expected to have at least some contempt, some abhorrence, to bear. But no, her face was calm, almost ex pressionless, as she returned his gaze with eyes steadfast as stars on winter nights. \" Miss Trepinnock,\" he said with all the firmness he could muster, \" I have come, I have thought it right to come, to make an explanation.\" For a moment a gleam as of hope shot into her face, but it fled as quickly as it came before his own look of hopelessness. \"Will you give me an opportunity of making it ?\" he added. For very shame his eyes were lowered to the flags. \"To my father? \" \" Primarily it concerns yourself/' he said."], [214, "196 LAWRENCE WESTERTON \" Anything you may bid me say to your father I will say \u2014 afterwards.\" \" Mr. Westerton, you presume \" I presume nothing, Miss Trepinnock. I ask it as one human creature may ask his fellow-creature. To-morrow I am going away by the first train to London. If you refuse to give me an opportunity of making it before then, I must go away at once : I am ready.\" \" And you could come here ! ' \" I have come here.\" \" Mr. Westerton, I recognise in myself no right to demand any explanation from you : I recognise no right in you to ask me to hear one.\" He looked at her feet ; he paused : he looked up into her face, and paused again ; and as he looked a sullen despair grew upon him. He turned slowly round and moved away along the terrace, praying to Almighty God just for sufficient strength to carry him out of her sight. He had barely reached the terrace steps, how ever, when the drawing-room window opened and the Squire stepped out. \"Ah! Westerton,\" he exclaimed, \"I thought I heard voices. Glad to see you. Wren's not come up yet. Why, don't you mean to stay dinner ? \" Lawrence stopped. \"I have come \u2014 \u2014 \" he began. \" Mr. Westerton came up here first,\" broke in Doris tremulously catching her father's arm ; \" and now he's going round to the front door to be ad mitted properly.\" Her eyes blazed direction. Lawrence turned a searching glance upon her."], [215, "EXPLANATION 197 He understood. Her father did not know, was not to know, anything that had happened. He was grateful for that. She wished him to stay there fore just long enough to save appearances. What she wished he would do. \" Yes,\" he said, with a sickly caricature of a smile ; \" it was hardly correct to come in through the drawing-room windows, was it ? \" His feeble joke nearly turned him sick. The Squire eyed him curiously. \" By George, Westerton,\" he said, \"you look as if you'd had a sunstroke.\" Again Lawrence smiled the same sickly smile. \" The sun has been hot to-day,\" he stammered ; \" perhaps that's it.\" \" Well, come and take your coat off, man,\" cried the Squire. \" I've got it,\" he thought. \" Poor chap ! He's had his look in, has he ? Well, I'm sorry. He's a good sort. I am darned sorry. What a thing it is to have a daughter with a mind of her own ! \" Mr. Wren was just entering the porch as they walked round, so the Squire's attention was dis tracted for a moment, and Lawrence had time to collect himself, and think what he should do. He would stay for dinner, allow a decent interval after wards, and then be off, he thought ; though how he was ever to get through it he could not imagine. When dinner was announced a notion occurred to the Squire. \" I'll pay her out,\" he chuckled to himself, \" for refusing the best offer she's had.\" \" Mr. Wren,\" he said, \" will you take in Mrs."], [216, "198 LAWRENCE WESTERTON Salter; Mr. Westerton \u2014 my daughter. I'll lead the way.\" Perhaps it was fortunate that he did so, or his idea might have been considerably upset. For Lawrence never so much as offered his arm to the Squire's daughter. He let her pass in front of him, with his eyes fixed on the carpet. And all through dinner he never looked at her once. The Squire's arrangement partially defeated its own object ; for as he took one end, and Doris the other, it followed that Mr. Wren, who sat next Mrs. Salter, was necessarily much nearer Doris than was Lawrence, who had the other side of the big table all to himself. He did his utmost to make conversation across it to Mrs. Salter, who had noticed his looks at once, and attributed them to much the same cause as the Squire had; and she aided his efforts to the best of her ability, feeling compassionate and kindly disposed towards him. The Squire, too, as if to show his daughter the state of his own mind \u2014 it might lead her to recon sider her refusal \u2014 made much of him, and related all his pet anecdotes in his best style. No one, however, except perhaps Mr. Wren, and even he was not long in forming conclusions as to the cause of Doris' constraint, was much astonished when Lawrence explained that circumstances de manded his immediate return to London, or thought of inquiring further : and their considerate reticence, proceeding as it obviously did from sympathy with him in what they imagined was his dismissal, made Lawrence wish himself fathoms deep below the"], [217, "EXPLANATION 199 table. It was simply agonising to sit there in Doris' presence playing the part of the rejected lover, and hiding his degradation from them by a pretence that must seem disgusting to her, even though she had herself brought it upon him. He noticed that she ate next to nothing ; as for him self he was ravenously hungry, and ate everything that came in his way. He felt that he must have writhed on his chair if he did not keep himself occupied. But his glass of sherry remained un tasted before him ; he was afraid of that. Dessert came at last, and she almost immediately rose and went out with Mrs. Salter. The Squire adopted an easier attitude, and looking at Lawrence with a twinkle in his eye said : \" Well, if you're going I suppose there's no more to be said, except that I'm very sorry indeed. We're going to Scotland probably in the autumn, and if we do we shall be passing through London a few days before the Twelfth. You must come and give us a look up when we do. We shall stay at Tadbrooke's a day or two. You know it, I daresay. I'll write and let you know. I suppose a Law List address will find you.\" Dare he grasp at the Squire's kindly offer ? No, a thousand times no. \" I shall most likely be out of town then,\" he said. \" But it is very good of you, Mr. Trepinnock.\" \" Takes it hardly,\" thought the Squire, and turned to Mr. Wren, thinking it best to let Law rence alone ; and they fell to discussing a project of the Squire's concerning the repairs of the village"], [218, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 200 schoolhouse. Lawrence listened in a kind of dreamy way, as if he was so far removed from the possibility of sympathy with anything relating to Dartmoor now that their talk could not even interest him into endeavouring to catch what they said. And all the while he felt as Judas must have felt as he sat at meat with Him he had betrayed. \" Do you play whist ? \" said the Squire suddenly, and before Lawrence could object went on : \" Let's go into the drawing-room. Mrs. Salter will make a fourth.\" A sudden revulsion came upon him. Why not ? It would distract his attention, employ his faculties, obviate the necessity for conversation and yet fill up the time until he might go without exciting more remark. Mrs. Salter was sitting in the drawing-room alone. Doris had gone out into the garden, she explained ; had not felt well after her afternoon's ride, would no doubt come in presently. So they settled themselves round the card-table, the Squire and Mrs. Salter against Lawrence and Mr. Wren, married v. single the Squire would have it ; no, widowed, he corrected himself. With a determination that surprised himself even Lawrence forced his attention upon those red and black pips that were so utterly insignificant to him, wrested the odd trick from the grasp of Mrs. Salter's overwhelming trumps, brought out her honours on the top of the Squire's, led thirteenth cards in the last few rounds, and altogether confused and amazed that good lady to such an extent that she took to"], [219, "EXPLANATION 201 using her trumps the second time round out of pure anxiety to make them score somehow, capped her partner's best cards and eventually her own mistakes by revoking, and wrought the Squire up to that pitch of aggravation which it seems to be whist's peculiar privilege to excite and excuse. After winning two rubbers Lawrence got up. \" I am sorry to have to go so early, Mr. Tre pinnock,\" he said, \"but I have to be up first thing in the morning, and think I had better be off now.\" He could not bring himself to thank the Squire for his kindness and hospitality ; it was almost more than he could do to take his hand. Good Mrs. Salter pitied him from the bottom of her heart. So Doris was about to let him go with out even bidding him good-bye. \" I'll go out into the garden and see where Doris is,\" she exclaimed. \" Do,\" chimed the Squire. Lawrence gave her an appealing look, but of course she misconstrued it, and went out by the window on to the terrace. \" If you're off,\" said Mr. Wren, \" perhaps Mr. Trepinnock will excuse my going to, and let me walk down with you.\" \" Oh, don't let me disturb you all,\" said Law rence, inwardly imprecating the good-natured little parson. \" Hadn't you better stay and keep Mr. Trepinnock company ? \" Mr. Wren laughed at his own stupidity. \" Of course he hopes to see her in the garden,\" thought he. \" Well, perhaps I had better,\" he said ; \"Mr."], [220, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 202 Trepinnock, will you let me stay after that, and beat me at draughts in return ?\" \" Of course,\" said the Squire. So they helped Lawrence on with his coat, and the Squire having reminded him again to look out for their passage through town in August, they wished him one more good-bye, saw him out of the front door, and returned to the drawing-room. Lawrence strode round by the drive, thanking Providence that he was free at last. But he was not free, for as he drew near the end of the lawn he saw two figures standing upon the grass. They were Mrs. Salter's and that of no other than Doris herself. A wild hope sprang up into his heart. Poor Doris ! It had been a terrible evening for her. She had learnt to love him. In spite of his indolence and selfishness she had believed in his earnestness, his desire to grope his way out of the darkness and difficulty of his lonely life ; she could not wholly disbelieve it now. In the careless defiance of his eyes, which had now and then grown so strangely meek when she looked into them, she had seen, or thought she had seen, a power and strength for self-sacrifice underlying his seemingly self-centred self-seeking inquiries and perplexities that she had longed to call into play ; and she felt even now that she had not been mis taken. She had resolved in pure maidenly pride of power to enlist him in her service, use that strength and bend it to follow the dictates of her own sovereign will ; and as was to be expected had"], [221, "EXPLANATION 203 grown to love him all the more for her resolve. She knew the value of her own true self ; and though she loved him because she could not help loving him, she was also determined that her love should be nothing if it could not guide and inspire him. And of her power to guide and inspire she had never doubted for a moment. Poor little fool ! Poor mistaken little fool ! Whether she was mistaken will appear. Whether you can believe that women with such ideas can never hope to be otherwise than mistaken is for you to decide for yourself. But now all she had given, all she hoped to give, had been met with contempt, with an affront too gross to endure. Behold ! the one she had chosen to honour, the one she had picked out as her knight for the tournament, her \" potential hero,\" was but an ordinary \" man of the world \" after all, a common paltry pleasure-seeker, with the crime against womanhood branded upon his brow for life, as she had seen it this afternoon. Her pride was turned to mortification and her love overwhelmed with loathing and abhorrence. She could not have believed she could be so deceived ; her nature revolted at the idea. She still could not believe that her choice was altogether wrong, that it was possible for her love to have gone out to a man who was wholly vile. It was against nature, incredible. But her disappointment, her disillusion, had come upon her so suddenly and mightily that she had had no time to battle with it"], [222, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 204 before it overwhelmed her ; and for the present all was bitterness and horror. Hers was not a nature to change suddenly, and she knew it ; she knew that she could not love again as she had loved this man ; she knew that it was her fate to love him still ; but all the life-giving, life-sustaining innocence was gone out of it, and she hated him the more because she could not hate him enough. Never, never should her love turn to infatuation ; and since he could never be clean in her eyes again she would pluck her heart out rather than acknow ledge that it could beat a single stroke the quicker for his coming or going. She would not even honour him with her contempt. Indifference was all such as he should merit at her hands, should it cost her her life. When he came and found her on the terrace she had played the part she had set herself better than she could have expected, but it was as much as she could do to prevent herself calling the servants to take him and cast him out of her father's gates. His presence was a pestilence. And yet she could admire his courage for coming. Then she had sat through dinner and directed him to remain out of consideration for her father, forced upon him a role which he had borne like a man, and been unjust to him out of mere dread of granting him a leniency, the granting of which seemed dishonour to her self-respect. She had shown herself afraid of him \u2014 she had allowed herself to be unjust because she was afraid of him, she \u2014 who had sworn to be indifferent."], [223, "EXPLANATION 205 Indifference implies justice ; and fear is unjust all the world over. There was no dishonour in being just to him, and her fear was not that he might discover her love, marred and shattered as she felt it to be into a mere wreck of all it had been, but lest she should betray herself into showing that abhorrence which would imply that she still con sidered him worthy of her scorn. Mrs. Salter had found her pacing the grass quite calm and collected, and when she asked whether she was not coming in just to bid Lawrence good-bye received the amazing answer : \" I am waiting for him here.\" Mrs. Salter's sense of propriety was duly shocked. \" Not alone ! Here ! Doris ! \" \" Alone ; here ; Doris intends to meet Mr. Westerton.\" \" But my dear girl,\" exclaimed Mrs. Salter ; \" surely your father \" \" Oh, Mrs. Salter,\" cried Doris ; \"if you think it necessary to ask my father, I freely give you per mission to do so. But as you love both him and me I do beg you not to.\" \" My dear Doris, what does it all mean ? \" \"I cannot tell you, Mrs. Salter. I wish to meet him alone. If you are afraid you may stand in the porch when he comes, only out of hearing.\" Mrs. Salter knew Doris' temper too well to question her any further. She was overcome with wonder. This surely was not a lover's quarrel ; and yet what could Doris mean by staying out here"], [224, "206 LAWRENCE WESTERTON unless she intended to encourage Lawrence, or unless there was something seriously wrong ? \u2014 In which case she ought not to remain a moment longer. Mrs. Salter's one love affair had been conducted on such strict lines of decorum that she would as soon have thought of marrying a bankrupt as of allowing the moon to have anything to do with the preliminaries. When Lawrence came out therefore he found the two standing, as I have said, on the edge of the grass, Mrs. Salter still imploring Doris to come away ; but as he approached she gave in at last and shrank back towards the house. He did not dare, however, to pause or seem conscious of their presence until Doris called to him : \" Mr. Westerton, I refused to hear an explana tion you came to make. I have reconsidered my determination. If you still wish to make it you may do so.\" He shivered at the icy tones of her voice.

And no power on earth shall prevent me.\" There was no torrent, no rush of passion. He stated it calmly in the low voice of solemn deter mination, as a mere matter of fact. If he had done otherwise, if he had said it on his knees she would have left him then and there. But this passionless declaration called for no resentment ; his very daring to make it, and in such a manner, disarmed her. She remained simply because he had not grovelled to her. \" This fortnight,\" he went on, \" has been a revelation to me.

But my old life was not to be so easily shaken off as I expected ; in my careless ness I had given it leave to follow me here, before I met you. And I became so wrapt up in my new thoughts and purposes that I even forgot that. That \u2014 that woman did not come here because I was callous as to whether she came or not. You cannot believe any man could have intended it. She came \u2014 she came \u2014 because I had forgotten every thing. My life here has not been so great an out rage against you as you must have thought to-day. Believe me, my sole reason in declaring this is to prevent you, if I can, from thinking your power for good a whit less than you can have imagined it to be. I have told you my life is changed \u2014 there's no object in repeating it. \" It is part of your lot since the world is vile and you are alive that you should come across its lepers.

It is almost unnecessary to say this. \" And if I was wrong after all in trying to win your love I can never hope to undo that wrong, but only give you the assurance that it has changed me utterly.

Then in a whisper : \" Pardon. I talk of pardon \u2014 talk \u2014 talk. I did not come to talk of pardon. I am not that sort of cur. A viper bit you the other day.

In spite of the disgust and loathing which had taken possession of her, she could not help being affected by his quiet dignity and open avowal. No anguish, no passion of remorse, could have touched her as that had done. He was con temptible no longer ; and she quivered a little as he ended. \"Yes,\" he added almost immediately, fearing lest the tumult within him should after all break out into words. \" I think that is all I have to say. Do you wish me to repeat it, Doris Trepinnock, to your father ? \" \" No, sir,\" she answered, \" there is no need for that.

He turned and sped up the avenue."], [229, "CHAPTER XIV THE PURPOSE GLORIFIED Up the avenue, through the gates, over the road, and away across the moor, right up to Crocodile Tor : he never paused for an instant, with the tempest of his passions roaring and surging within his heart and threatening to burst it asunder with every step. He had restrained them manfully until now ; he could do so no longer ; and when he reached the Tor they broke out into an uncontrol lable paroxysm of fury, and with a fearful cry he flung himself down on his face and clutched and tore at the long coarse grass till his fingers bled. For one hideous moment the thought of suicide burnt into his brain like a lightning flash, and was gone. All the devil-defiance of his soul rose to shriek out \"No.\" Then he lay and panted, overwhelmed with a horrible despair. \" May God forgive you for the wrong you have done, here and elsewhere.\""], [230, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 212 Here !

Oh ! grant that, grant that, Almighty ! He lay upon the grass and writhed with his despair. He, with the knowledge that he was not fit to live, was yet forbidden to die : must refuse to die. He, with this cankerof remorse fixed, clutching on his heart, incurable, ineradicable, unbearable, was yet to bear it, was beginning to bear it ! He, who had been unable to live rightly while he was still free, was yet to live, and know that it was consuming his strength and weakening his energies day by day ! He, who had had no object to live for, was now to feel that when he struggled upward to grasp and reach at one his past would rise, and put a barrier as impassable as Dives' gulf between him and it ! What hope has the man who has never paid the price of his daily bread to pay it in future ? With what hope can he set about paying that, and not only that, but the long account of debts behind ? And this vision of the beauty of love and good ness, what had it profited him ? Had it proved to him the vanity, already proven, of youth and folly and vice and thoughtlessness and thought fulness alike ? And if it had, where lay the advantage in knowing that his life was vanity, if the conviction did nought but send him back to prove it all over to himself again alone \u2014 alone, ever and ever alone ; alone now and always ?

And yet \" hope is denied to no one under any circum stances,\" \" is justified by the condition of our being.\" To put it aside the suicide he had refused. But what hope ? What sort of hope was possible for him ? Had not his better nature risen, even while he spoke to her, and told him plainly ?

Yes truly, but for all that he had not calculated his strength to perform what he had sworn, and his life might still belie his words and bring upon him the last infamy of all. Again the voice : Is it nothing to hope to be worthy, not indeed to love her, but to have loved her ? Is there no man who can work for no reward in the future, no man noble enough to work only because it is right to work ? Cannot you be"], [233, "THE PURPOSE GLORIFIED 215 one ?

Not as he had seen it first, not as he had seen it glowing when she bowed to help him, but wear ing ever the same calm indifference with which it had turned to hear him just now, was that face to come and haunt him, and in the midst of self denial, labour, and weariness rise to tell him : it is all useless, unavailing ? How could he hope to endure that ? And even if those features could return in all their former happy beauty, and smile upon him as they had smiled before this day, and he were to set them in heaven for his guiding star, he must set them behind and not before him, and direct his course by looking backward, never forward, and watch them growing gradually paler and paler the further he went, dimmer and dimmer the faster he fled away. Was not that despair ? He drew himself up against a lichened block of granite, and throwing his arms about it pressed his cheek against its cold surface and tried to reconcile himself to that dreary thought. And gradually a great calm settled upon him. This lichen that his fingers were rubbing away.

Was it content to have fulfilled its purpose and now be effaced thus ? Was it possible to have defeated its purpose, God's purpose, for him ? Was it possible for him to have defeated any of God's purposes ? To think not was fatalism. And yet to think that he could have defeated the Maker's purpose with even this little patch of lichen was appalling. He stared up at the moon. The moon was dead, they said, turned to stone. The earth would die and turn to stone too, and with it all the life that had fulfilled the Maker's laws. But he who had broken them was alone immortal, so they said. Did God mock himself ? Or was it true that after all man's immortality was given that he might through ages of purifying fire grow to conform to those laws like the rest ? Then death were surely his too. He wondered critically whether he were growing crazy or light-headed that such absurdities should crowd into his brain. What did it matter to him ? The lichen would grow again and never care, the earth and the moon would fulfil their destiny and never care, whether he lived to be a hundred or died to-night. He was infinitesimal, and yet his wretchedness was immense. The earth would never care. Why should he"], [235, "THE PURPOSE GLORIFIED 217 care that he had defiled the earth ? The earth was incapable of defilement. Could he defile this block of granite ? His own soul and others he could defile, yet how so ? Only through that portion of the earth that went to make his own frame and theirs; which could not be defiled. What contradictions were involved in every thought to-night ! He looked around and down across the long slope towards the Squire's home. It could not be true that he was to leave all this to-morrow. Sup pose he were to go, not back to London, but to some other place like this, wipe out this last fortnight and begin another holiday : get up now as from reading a story that did not belong to this life but had enthralled him into forgetfulness of realities for a time, and walk abroad now that he had read it through, Lawrence Westerton himself once more seeking relaxation from the law-books. As well try to realise in imagination summer in winter or satiety in hunger ! Lawrence Westerton himself again ! It could not be ; Heaven forbid that it should ever be ! Not his own : anything but that ! He had been his own long enough to know the worthlessness of the possession to himself. What it might be worth to others was to be seen. She had said it must be worth something, and that pure spirit in her which had taught her to say so was infallibly wise.

Ah God ! that was all he wanted. Would He whose laws he had outraged, Whom he had inquired after by methods applicable for construction ! rather than comprehending, because He was incomprehensible, unknowable, would He who had given the light to the world, to Whom men had prayed, because they were His sons and He their Father, through centuries of Pater nosters, would He bow down to hear him and help him in spite of doubt, disbelief, and refusal even to pray ? How could he pray ? How could he grasp at the forms before he had the spirit \u2014 he who had mocked God all his life long ? If He could value repentance, He could value a repentance that took the form of deeds as well as that which drove the Prodigal on to his father's neck with tears and made him heedless of the better part of the resolution formed when still in the far country. He was still a man ; how could he crawl and cringe and pray for forgiveness, while his re pentance was no more than the conviction of misery? If that God, her God, looked for humiliation, here was humiliation enough ; if for repentance, surely the repentance of a life, and not a few hours of sorrow and presumptuous words. If He was ready to help the repentant, must it not be because they repented, not because they mouthed to Him"], [237, "THE PURPOSE GLORIFIED 219 upon their knees ; because they set about helping themselves ? He could not pray without faith. The Prodigal knew he had a father. But he \u2014 he could not groan out the Church's formulae with an \"if\" before every one of them. If he were to put faith in aught it must be a faith in Justice before all else. If his repentance was honest Justice would recognise it, and if not a prayer that it might yet be recognised seemed too craven a cry for pity for a man to make. Not his own ! She had given him something to do, something that if he lived he knew a human being could do. If he did that the next duty would seem clearer too perchance Be that as it might be, there was that something to do at once. He would set about doing it without a day's delay ; and the rest, he would leave to \u2014 whom it might concern to see after it ; if God \u2014 God then, of justice, of truth, of Doris and Mr. Wren ; and if himself \u2014 himself with a revelation vouchsafed to him that would keep him in the right way for some time to come at the least. Disbelief cannot suddenly turn to belief by the mere acknowledgment of the want of belief; nor while a man believes not is he logically justified in acting as if he did, even though commanded ; for a command implies authority, and though it may be expedient to obey while he doubts the authority, his obedience is given to expediency, not the authority. Is true repentance impossible without steadfast faith ?"], [238, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 220 If it be so Lawrence was in a bad way, for he only acknowledged the God of omnipotence, and strange to say, of inattention and disregard also. And now that he had grown conscious of the in adequacy of that belief to support him through a real trial there was no comfort in imagining how much better he could have borne it if he had believed differently. He did not believe differently, and must go through with it as he was. He could not even say \" Help Thou my unbelief,\" as no one can who considers what it means. Belief is absolute. As he was he felt that he must work out his repentance and no otherwise, assuming nothing that he had not assumed, believing nothing until he had real ground for believing ; and again, leave the rest to whom it might concern. But this he did believe firmly \u2014 that Doris was \"incorruptibly good and instinctively, infalliblywise,\" and believing that, whatever else was wrong, this was right, to do what she had bidden him to do. If there was any path open for him to tread it must be the path in treading which he had no doubt that he was treading rightly. Little enough hope had he of attaining any further knowledge of things divine if he rejected the first certainty that came in his way, forsooth because some had denied that any divinity was contained there. The retort was obvious : because you disbelieve this, am I com pelled to disbelieve it ? If so, your belief in what ever you believe must be also shaken, howsoever slightly. \" Who knows the ways of the world, how"], [239, "THE PURPOSE GLORIFIED 221 God will bring them about ? Our planet is one, the suns are many, the world is wide : \" wide enough for you and me also ; let me be. Perhaps in time I too may gain some knowledge of the divine revelation. You have sprung to the fountainhead at once. I must down to the sea to follow it up from thence. And this divinity was intangible to corruption. Incorruptible, she could be grieved, offended ; she could pardon the offence against herself even as he had said, because he was beneath hatred \u2014 like the viper. So Lawrence crouched, clasping the granite, and pondering over all that had been, and planning out what was now to be, far into the night ; while the restfulness of Nature sleeping around him under the silent moon, and the peace that comes of submission and lofty resolve wrought upon his soul, and slowly wrapt him o'er with a calm contentment he would have deemed as impossible for himself a few hours ago as the attainment of Doris herself. He had played and lost, and in losing won a blessing in disguise, a blessing like that of Adam's curse. His Purpose was set before him \u2014 glorified. And what of Doris \u2014 Doris palpitating with the knowledge that she could neither be contemptuous nor indifferent ; Doris burning with a sense of wrong and outrage done to her ; Doris humiliated with that bitter humiliation which only noble women can pass through without degradation, and no woman at all without knowing what it is to tremble \u2014 \u25a0"], [240, "222 LAWRENCE WESTERTON the humiliation of having loved a fallen man ; Doris shaken and quivering and left behind to feel her first maiden's love turned to pollution by this world's vices as her love for her brother had been ; Doris left to count the cost and purge her life as she could \u2014 what of her ? That she stood in maidenly majesty till he had passed up the avenue out of her sight, as she thought for ever, goes without saying ; that she silently went up to her own little niche in the world overlooking the moonlit woods, and there bent in maidenly shame to pour out her heart afterwards, that goes without saying too. And what more can you want ? There I will leave her for the present ; and where better ? She will not fail in doing whatever she considers it right to do. But as for Lawrence he rose at last to go forth into the world again, to play the man and do his duty, with her image in his heart and fresh defiance in his eye ; and as a preliminary walked down to the inn and slept the sleep of utter exhaustion on the cut angle of a haystack, for the inn itself had long since been closed for the night."], [241, "CHAPTER XV INITIATION Of the dark stern legends that have come down to us out of the gloom of the Middle Ages surely the legend of Tannhauser is one of the most appalling. As it stood in the original version it became unendurable. But it was right for all that, the conclusion consistently inevitable. Absolution was refused, moral suicide was the result. There could be no other. Why then does our later version tell us that Tannhauser did not return to Venus, but in spite of the Pope's fearful denunciation and the Church's wrath and rejection, in spite of himself, came back to find forgiveness risen to meet him from the bier of a pure maiden ? We feel that there must be something wrong about the older version ; the revisers would not admit it must be true. And the only ground for the new termination seems to be this, that Tann hauser did not wholly despair. And he did not despair, because we recognise that a Pope's refusal could not be final, we attribute to Tannhauser a doubt as to its necessary consequence. And surely"], [242, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 224 we are right too. We deny the Pope's power, not the consequence of a final refusal.

Yet now in this nineteenth century comes the old story back again, and men arise with the de lusion in their hearts this time and not in their heads, and tell us that the later version is an optimistic fabrication, and point to modern instances of Venus' power, and write books too of a realistic order, labelled \" true to life,\" to prove their doctrine of despair. \" See here,\" say they, \" Venus of the highway (or as the case may be) and the man ! \" We tell you, after this matter of fact manner all our own, that Venus must conquer and the man be slain, or worse than slain ; not indeed because he cannot be forgiven, oh no ! \u2014 forgiveness is too profitable for Papa to be so foolish as our honest old friend of the story, who at his worst does not appear to have been over-anxious about his pocket (he might have made a very good thing out of Tannhauser), and moreover did his best by deputy to set things straight afterwards \u2014 but because he cannot repent, which comes to the same thing, be cause Venus is more powerful than \u2014 well, because his repentance would not be ' true to life,' because indeed it is possible for a man to destroy his free will.\" Never.

And Lawrence did not despair, in the full sense of the word. True he had given up all hope of attaining Doris now, the Doris of flesh and blood ; but there was a Doris to be attained for all that, the Doris of his own heart, whose praise he had set himself to work and hope for. Naturally his resolution of the night before did not seem altogether so soul-sufficing when he awoke next morning cold and stiff on the haystack, but it remained quite as fixed and settled. There was no alternative, and after his years of aimless existence it was comfortable beyond measure to know that for the present his road was certain and defined, entirely indisputable. After a few gasps at the recollection of what he had gone through his courage returned, and with it his resignation ; and he lay for a while listening to the thrushes in the little larch plantation up above, and watching the mist lift over the moor which had grown so dear to him, and which he was now to leave in a few hours. Soberly, unflinchingly he thought over all he had determined and solemnly renewed his determination, and then stirred by a sudden impulse \u2014 so incon sistent are we \u2014 he knelt where he had lain and thanked the Almighty for life and hope, and dedi cated himself afresh to the service of Doris in the light of the sun. And then he jumped down off the haystack and p"], [244, "226 LAWRENCE WESTERTON walked round to the inn-door to knock until Polly came with scared face to let him in. It was out of pure sentiment, no doubt. But sentiment does force its claims upon us sometimes in the doing of quite trivial matters, in an undeni able manner. He took out a change of clothes and went down and bathed himself in one of the pools of the ice-cold river. And the act seemed to strengthen him by its significance. After that there was nothing more to be done but eat some breakfast, bid good-bye to the Bakers and Polly, and then drive away down from the heights into which he had entered a fortnight ago with such thoughtless unconcern. Not a tree, not a bend of road or torrent escaped his notice as he drove. His eyes took them all in to treasure. And long after the train had carried him from Totnes and well on the way towards Exeter, he kept his face pressed against the left-hand window, watching the hills grow dim and blue with the distance. It was hardly strange that his eyes grew rather moister than ordinary \u2014 with the strain of doing so. At Bristol he bought all the morning papers and fell to studying them attentively. They seemed satisfactory, and he carefully made pencil marks round certain paragraphs in the advertisement sheets and elsewhere. After that he went to sleep, and slept until he reached Paddington. He had not had much sleep in the last few days, and nature was kind enough to refuse him permission to brood any more at present over all that might have been. When he arrived at his lodgings his father's"], [245, "INITIATION 227 old servant David did not at all approve of his looks. \" Well I must say, Master Lawrence,\" he re marked as he hovered over his master's evening meal, \" that your holiday don't seem to have done you very much good, sir.\" \" None of that,\" said Lawrence. \" It has done me a deal more good than I can realise at present. But David, old man, there's a busy time coming for you, and in quite a new line too.\" He strove to be cheerful. \" What's that, Master Lawrence ? \" \" All in good time David. And if you turn your back on me,\" he added smiling, \" I'll never forgive you, David ; there.\" David smiled too, the smile of the loyal old fashioned retainer that he was. \"You always was a puzzle, Master Lawrence.\" \" To start with,\" said Lawrence, \"you must go out to-morrow morning early and bring me in all the morning papers. And now stick some paper and ink and things on the table, and go and unpack my traps. I'm dog tired.\" When David had departed he spread out the newspapers he had purchased on his journey and began writing letters. There must be no delay. Every appeal for help towards giving London chil dren the benefit of change of air and a day in the country he answered, not indeed simply offering pecuniary assistance \u2014 he had been bidden to do more than that \u2014 but offering, in as humble a manner as his inexperience necessitated, his personal"], [246, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 228 assistance also. It was the season of the year when such appeals begin to multiply, and there were six altogether. Next morning he again examined all the papers. But there was nothing fresh. This was rather disappointing. Six, however, were enough to begin upon, perhaps more than enough if he meant doing justice to them all. So as there was nothing more to be done in that direction at present he went down to Lincoln's Inn. It was Whitsun-week and the place was comparatively deserted. No work had come for him in his absence, but for that he was rather thankful, feeling as he did. He sat down in his chair and looked around him at the things, the books and furniture with which the last few years of his life had been so closely associated. The room now appeared to him like a tattered old garment, which he had endeavoured to take off and lay aside, only to be ordered to pick it up and put it on again at once, and work in it in spite of all its sordid meanness. Baddeley and Ward's guide to South Devon lay on the table where he had left it when he went away. He took it up and unfolded the maps before him, and by their aid reconstructed in his mind pictures of all the places he had visited. There was Crocodile Tor and the river and the inn, there the roads he had walked along, and there some dots that represented Barrowdown. He could not bear to look any longer ; he folded the maps up quickly and closed the book."], [247, "INITIATION 229 He looked around again. In this den, with the dusty brown Chancery and Queen's Bench Reports glooming down upon him, powerless to relieve one single pang, was he, Lawrence Westerton, to live and slave and daily learn afresh what it was to suffer. Already he began to realise the true bitterness of his life in the future. The first anguish of his loss was past. Tenfold harder to bear would be this perpetual everyday want of sympathy, this dreary monotony of external vulgar commonplace, absolute. Ah ! it had been easy to resolve to do great things in that holy sanctuary of Dartmoor, but the carrying out of them was to be here, or about here. He had never yet felt so utterly lonely and forsaken as he did this morning in this dingy little room. He felt more than lonely, he felt afraid, afraid of himself, afraid that he should not be able to endure or perform in spite of all his resolutions. The struggle was beginning, and for the moment he staggered. He sat bolt upright in his chair. What, Lawrence Westerton to be overthrown at the first grapple ! However, it was as well to know that Lawrence Westerton was not quite strong enough to conquer by mere passive resistance. Sit still in a chair and brood ! No victory was ever yet won by brooding over the possibility of defeat. He shook himself and thought again.

Was ever \" noting up \" done in such a frame of mind before ? For the benefit of the incompre hending I might as well explain that is almost purely mechanical work, the driest of the dry, requiring a good supply of patience and involving a fair amount of physical activity as well as material dust. But it was just the sort of job he wanted, a job which prevented his mind from wandering unpleasantly, but which did not suffer in execution from an occa sional pause to recall the face of her who was in future to sanctify the common labour of that monthly task ; as she sanctified everything that became asso ciated with the thought of her in his mind. And never afterwards did he look for the advent of the new numbers of those same reports otherwise than joyfully ; though formerly they had represented to him nothing but so much fresh and disagreeable matter to be added to an already over-grown accumulation requiring legal digestion. Now they were to be a monthly reminder of the worth of Doris' advice."], [249, "1NITIA TION 231 When he had finished he wandered back through the streets westward, marvelling at their inability to arouse the least interest in him. There was the same turmoil, the same never-ending succession of shopfuls of millinery, the same savage yell at every corner from the ragged newspaper boy, the same hurrying and jostling \u2014 and he was as indifferent to it all as his own God. He reached the Park and sat down on a chair to think once more. And even as he sat down came the voice within him again and said, \"Don't think. Have you not had one lesson already to-day ? \" Yet thinking seemed to him the only means by which he could hope to keep the memory of Doris ever present before him. He had indeed recog nised the danger for him in thinking much, if he was to face his future without quailing ; but unless he thought the memory of Doris would fade too fast. Was he to give up even that bitter pleasure? It would be the same in the end, the same in the end. He clenched his hands, tortured. If he thought of her and his loss the thought would unman him, if he did not think of her there would be nothing to bind him to his work. The same in the end. \" Don't think.\" But at least while he could work without think ing it were better to obey her. And if he could not continue to work so \u2014 it were better to obey her still. Never a moment of peace, never a moment in which to pause in his labour for fear his labour might be the worse for that pause ! Truly he"], [250, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 232 had set himself a difficult task, an almost impossible task. \" Don't think !\" \" So help me Heaven, then I won't even think of you. But twice a day, Doris, must I glance upward \u2014 and backward, just to see that I am steering straight ! \" He arose immediately, and walked rapidly back to his rooms. Three or four replies to his offers had already arrived, thankful kindly replies, all from clergymen, all inviting him to call with a view to making arrangements ; not a suspicion of anything but unmixed gratitude in any one of them. He took a cab and drove to the address given in the one that seemed the most business-like. It was a grey-headed middle-aged man that looked up from a pile of correspondence and what were evidently lengthy accounts to greet him, as he was ushered into a small dark room not a mile from the Angel of Islington. Lean and careworn and somewhat shabbily dressed was the Rev. Hartley Phillips, aged before his time, the burden of his responsibility plainly shown in the stoop of his shoulders and the furrows round his mouth and eyes. But as he rose he thrust his chin forward, out of habit come of life-loDg determination to look things in the face in spite of cause for stooping, and glanced at Lawrence with an expression in his hawk-like eyes of mingled surprise and curiosity over the unexpected nature of his visitor's appearance. Lawrence produced the reply he had received,"], [251, "INITIATION 233 and explained curtly that he was the person to whom it had been addressed ; and again announced that if the Rev. Hartley Phillips was minded to make use of the assistance offered it was at his service and only required directing. Mr. Phillips was certainly so minded. He pro ceeded to give Lawrence some account of the struggle in the midst of which he lived and the difficulty of providing the means for healthy en joyment in a neighbourhood where the means of life demanded exclusive consideration. Lawrence listened patiently. Mr. Phillips eyed him. Would Lawrence provide vehicles for a day at Epping Forest \u2014 if he was ready to begin at once \u2014 next Wednesday ? He himself would provide the children, there was no lack. Lawrence was ready, but must ask for personal assistance, as he had no notion how to manage such an expedition. Yes, personal assistance would be forthcoming. That was always ready ; it was only money that was wanting. Lawrence took down names and addresses of contractors for the supply of brakes and omnibuses \u2014 he would go and see after them at once \u2014 informa tion as to the keepers of \" retreats \" at the Forest likewise, and the hour and place of meeting, number of children and other sundries. \" You must understand,\" he said at last, surveying his note-book, \" that I'm quite new to this business, but I mean to come along myself. I've put everything down I can think of. I seem to have got all I want.\""], [252, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 234 \"I think so,\" said Mr. Phillips, \"except my best thanks for your \" \" That is all then,\" repeated Lawrence without looking up. Mr. Phillips' curiosity did not abate. He was not the one to resent Lawrence's bluntness and obvious disinclination to have his project regarded from any but a purely business point of view ; but he could not help wondering what it might be that had driven this young man of the world of the west out into the world of the north-east after this manner : with such a seemingly total want of the usual enthusiasm of the newly philanthropical too. He shook his hand and let him go ; and Law rence spent the rest of the day in contractors' offices, writing orders, and mapping out the busi ness. His other visits he put off till next day, and went to bed early so that he might be up betimes ; too early, for sleep refused the summons. He lay and tried to force his brain to think of nothing but Mr. Phillips and the expedition. He counted children getting into an omnibus for ap propriate variation of the sheep and the gap in the hedge method. He went through intricate calcula tions as to the number of expeditions at various given costs that could be supported by his income in a year. Then he derided himself for imagining that sleeplessness caused by such trouble as his could be overcome by such paltry childish processes. Then he raged at himself for magnifying his troubles by such comparisons."], [253, "INITIATION 235 Then he got up, lit a candle and read the evening paper without understanding a word. There was moonlight and a face. Suppose every night were to be like this. Opiates ? Brandy ? No he pre ferred whisky. He must really be getting sleepy to permit of such notions. Calculation as to how sleepy he must be, gauged thus, woke him up again fully. What was she doing to-night ? Was she asleep ? What effect upon her life ? He seized the paper and began on the advertisements : \" On May 31st, the wife of William Hodges, of Park Villa, Ealing Common, of a son.\" There was joy then in the house of William Hodges of Ealing. \" Lost a diamond earring, &c.\" And these things were of interest to some people, and absolutely none to him ; as he was absolutely none to them. What would little Hodges be when he grew up ? They would probably call him William after his father. And he would never know that his birth came to the notice of a perfect stranger, to be wondered at in the silence of the night. How many other perfect strangers had noticed Hodges' birth ? How sickening these attempts at escape and oblivion were ! He blew out the candle and lay back to simply wait. And the face in the moonlight came before him cold and immovable as the granite of Crocodile Tor. But after a time he slept."], [254, "CHAPTER XVI ANOTHER PICNIC He woke with a heavy heart, and set out early on his round of calls. After more or less difficulty he succeeded in discovering all his correspondents but one, learnt as much as he could about their various schemes with regard to the object in view, read any number of leaflets which they presented to him with statements as to past work and accounts concerning the same, listened to them patiently, absorbed information necessary and unnecessary, made arrangements for participating in and subsidis ing expeditions of all sorts at early dates, became a life-governor of an institution for providing fort nights of sea air to convalescent children and a home for deformed ditto in the course of the morning, and altogether set about \" interesting himself in the cause of charity \" so far as related to the young to a perfectly bewildering extent. His pocket-book grew full of dates, addresses, and memoranda, and his head of wonder that he could have remained so deaf and blind and callous all his life. Amongst other things of smaller importance, or"], [255, "ANOTHER PICNIC 237 perhaps not so small, his idea of the size of London developed considerably. Cab expenses assisted towards the development. The only unpleasant part of the business was to him the boundless and astonished gratitude with which his proposals were everywhere received. It did not give him any satisfaction ; on the contrary it made him very uncomfortable as he reflected upon his past indifference, and the motives that were inspiring him now. No thanks were due to himself, but to her whose commands he was obeying. And yet he had to sit and listen and play the good Samaritan, all the time feeling uncommonly like a hypocrite. He had thoughts at one time of pre tending mere agency, that he was the conduit-pipe of anonymous benevolence. But the personal part he would have to undertake forbade that. Besides it was silly and untrue. He could comfortably have knocked down one old vicar, who ventured to call him \" my son \" and alluded, rather too unctuously for forbearance, to certain \" treasures in Heaven.\" Lawrence did not want treasures in Heaven, much less did he want to be thought to be wanting them. He wanted treasures on earth very badly, or at least the satis faction of knowing he had done what he could to attain them, even if unattainable. But the poor vicar was so old and so overcome by Lawrence's offers, and his very quotations, whether in conse quence or not, became so extremely inapposite, that Lawrence forgave him his gratitude, swallowed his own indignation, and even subscribed towards"], [256, "238 LAWRENCE WESTERTON the gas expenses attendant upon a course of penny readings, which seemed a particular pet project, so that the penance of another outburst of thanks and scripture might be inflicted ; as it was im mediately. Then he went home and thought over his day's work, and grew gloomily indignant at his inability to blind himself to its comic side. The comicality, if there was any, arose from his own incongruity, and after all that was something too lamentable to be ridiculous. In a fidgety state of unrest he drew a picture of a gentleman in a frock-coat, with a lady's sleeve tucked round his top-hat, and a Latin motto inscribed on his waistcoat, offering a cup, labelled \" cold water,\" to a couple of extremely ragged children. He gazed at it for a long time with a cynical smile, occasionally adding an extra touch to improve the picturesqueness of the children's rags and the metallic lustre of the gentleman's top hat. To complete it he encircled the gentleman's head with a set of rays like the spokes of a wheel to represent appropriate halo. Where did the fun come in ? Why should a frock-coat in connection with ragged children and the typical act of charity appear so absurd, or a lady's favour in his hat or her motto upon his heart nought but matter for cari cature ? He thought of Don Quixote, crumpled up his drawing and left off smiling, cynically or otherwise."], [257, "ANOTHER PICNIC 239 Don Quixote does not make us smile nowadays, at least not for long. Altogether he felt uncommonly miserable and dejected. He had thought that the start would have had an enlivening influence upon him at all events ; and all it had done was to arouse this sense of self-mockery, which was but a mean sort of dis loyalty. He had hoped that the consciousness of being at work would have been able to carry him through the inevitable pauses, when he must rest, if not cheerfully at least not too discontentedly ; and he might just as well have sat in a chair all day brood ing, for all the effect his work had produced upon him. It was truly encouraging to think that between lying down and going to sleep there would always be an interval, and that interval torture ; \" deuced encouraging,\" he muttered aloud. He took up the whisky decanter on his sideboard and proceeded to scornfully justify to himself the abuse of its contents, after the manner of cynical \" common sense.\" Then he felt that the reality of fear of it would have been preferable to this imaginative contempt. All seemed to provide source for contempt, and chiefly his own contemptible self. On the day before his expedition with Mr. Hartley Phillips' children he took David into his confidence. Poor old David had grown very puzzled at the change in his master. Of its nature. he began to have some idea on hearing Lawrence's"], [258, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 240 announcement, and at once volunteered to accom pany him so eagerly that Lawrence could not have refused, even if he had wished. Fortunately the Wednesday of initial experience was beautifully fine. He and David drove to Mr. Phillips' house early, and found that gentleman prepared to accompany them himself. Twenty girls under the supervision of the school mistress and twenty- five boys were waiting at the schoolrooms near, and the brakes Lawrence had ordered were there in readiness too, with the idlers of the neighbourhood lounging round them or leaning up against the street railings to watch the start. The approach of Mr. Phillips was greeted with a general outburst. Lawrence had not heard such an uproar since the days when he ran along the tow-path by the Cam in the May Races, and was consumed with envy and wonder at the way in which the vicar issued his directions and kept his head and his temper in spite of it all. David was consigned to the care of the girls and their schoolmistress, and after a few struggles for places and some shoving and malice and reproof the first brake-load set off shrieking in the best of spirits. The boys were rather more difficult to arrange. They all wanted to sit on the seats beside and behind the driver, and the places Mr. Phillips assigned to them seemed invariably to be the very ones they were least attracted towards. The activity with which they impressed this fact upon"], [259, "ANOTHER PICNIC 241 his notice made the packing a laborious process and delayed the start a good quarter of an hour. It was only by threatening to leave those behind who did not settle down in two minutes that Mr. Phillips at last succeeded in freeing the wheels and inducing sufficient tranquillity into the interior to admit of departure without catastrophe. By this time Lawrence had begun to realise something of what Doris' prediction had meant. Not that he felt ridiculous now so much as inade quate. There was nothing for him to do at present, and yet he felt that he ought to be doing something towards keeping the boys soberly amused and in terested, and was wholly incapable of doing it. He was quite ready to put up with the noise, he had known that was unavoidable ; and he had also known that the general atmosphere that environs unwashed humanity in the mass and hot weather was likely to be distinctly unpleasant, at first at all events, and had prepared himself for that also. But it all had to be endured, and the enduring of it engrossed his attention to the exclusion of any thing else : he grew dazed and hot and distracted, and more envious of Mr. Phillips' quite disregard of these petty annoyances than ever. And then when they reached the half-way house, and stopped to rest and water the horses, the boys insisted on jumping down to spend their coppers on ginger-beer and nuts and oranges and pepper mint, and a horrible compound wrapped in paper yclept or rather spelt \" hokey-pokey,\" which ap peared to \" comprehend of itself\" the concentrated Q"], [260, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 242 objectionabilities of all the sweetstuff that was ever invented ; and brought everything back with them into the brake, the floor of which was quickly plas tered with layers of nutshells and orange-peel and paper of all descriptions and degrees of uncleanness. And some began to eat the lunch they had brought, heedless of the fact that tea was not to be had till half-past four. There was a man there too with a barrowful of scent squirts, and he did a roaring trade ; for the London juvenile never misses an opportunity of indulging in horse-pla}*, and the brake-load of girls was there sucking different sorts of things and waiting to have their faces squirted, and to shriek and slap promiscuously, where possible, in return, in accordance with approved practice on such occasions. Where all the coppers came from was a mystery to Lawrence, for the children were ragged enough in spite of their Sunday finery. Mr. Phillips ex plained ; which set Lawrence pondering over false pride as exemplified in the preference for sending children out treating in ragged stockings rather than without the means of vying with their fellows in the consumption of the \" beastlinesses off these barrows.\" In twenty minutes they were off again, and soon afterwards reached the outskirts of the forest. The noise had gradually moderated, and Lawrence was consequently beginning to recover the use of his faculties. The sight of the oaks too, in spite of the dust, was refreshing ; and by the time they reached"], [261, "ANOTHER PICNIC 243 the particular \" retreat \" recommended to his patron age he felt ready for the real burden and heat of the day: which was to amuse the children now that he had brought them out. Not that they required to be amused. They seemed perfectly content to spend their remaining coppers at the fairing stalls, and then run about and gape and quarrel : but this was not at all in accordance with Lawrence's theories concerning enjoyment ; and with praiseworthy inten tions he set to work to give them lessons in that most unteachable of sciences, the science of how to play. He lost his temper of course in the first five minutes, being human ; he recovered it and lost it again and again in the next three-quarters of an hour, and then he began to think that there might be something wrong about his method ; as indeed he would have known earlier if he had taken the trouble to consider a few things besides his theories. And all the while he was so engrossed that he never noticed how carefully Mr. Phillips was ob serving him, carefully and withal sorrowfully and admiringly. He tried another tack : these children, who, as he expressed it with regardless emphasis to them and Mr. Phillips and Epping Forest in general, could do nothing but \" rot and play the goat,\" surely they could understand the delights of swings and donkey-rides. Yes, but their money was all gone. Without a thought as to the possible im propriety of such a direct encouragement of prodigal habits he chartered a set of swings and half a dozen donkeys, and instructed the attendants to"], [262, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 244 administer ten-minute \"goes\" to the children in order until they gave out. After seeing them started he retired with David and the vicar to a secluded part of the \" retreat \" to recover and refresh himself. Mr. Phillips had brought with him a set of stumps, a couple of bats, and a cricket-ball, \" for them to amuse themselves with,\" he explained. And Lawrence now understood what he meant. But he was not going to allow himself to be beaten without an effort. \" If you will get a dozen out of the way,\" he said, \" the others shall play cricket and nothing but it as long as my voice holds out.\" \" You'll have your work cut out for you then,\" said Mr. Phillips ; \" never mind ; I'm sure I hope you'll succeed. We mostly find it easier to let them enjoy themselves their own way.\" \" I don't believe they do enjoy themselves,\" said Lawrence, theories still predominant ; \" they don't know how.\" Whether the boys whom he took in hand enjoyed themselves that afternoon he never found out, but at all events, they did no more \"rotting.\" He divided them into sides and bowled lobs to them perseveringly for two hours ; towards the end of which they began to have some vague notion of the first principles of single wicket, and a very distinct impression that Lawrence meant to have his own way and was not to be trifled with. Some of them sulked, and some of them disobeyed and defied him at first; for the London arab sets a most"], [263, "ANOTHER PICNIC 245 unwarrantable value upon the sanctity of his own dirty little person ; and all of them were ludicrously afraid of the cricket-ball itself, which did not tend to render Lawrence's task the easier ; but by threats and contempt (though the effect of this was con siderably less than he expected) and a wholesale disregard of their claims to personal inviolability he forced them gradually to attend to nothing but the game and to keep their assigned positions in the field. When Mr. Phillips returned at last from a walk with the rest he had reason for complimenting Lawrence on his success. His own experience as well as Lawrence's panting and perspiring condition told him plainly of difficulties overcome. Determina tion even in small matters commands admiration. Mr. Phillips began to feel a more than ordinary interest in his new acquaintance. He could put a value upon him. \" I'm sure I congratulate you,\" he said ; \" but I'm afraid you're rather done, aren't you ? \" \"Yes,\" said Lawrence, \"I've been standing here bowling and cursing till I'm ready to drop. I reckon I've sickened these chaps of cricket for the term of their natural lives. So I might just as well have let it alone for all the good I've done 'em. There are one or two though who might do some thing with it if they could get regular practice. But as I suppose they can't get that it seems absurd to have kept them here all afternoon, just to be able to say I've done what I said I would.\" \" It's just about the best thing you could have"], [264, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 246 done for them all the same,\" replied the vicar. \" It does them good to obey somebody, even \" \"I tell you what,\" broke in Lawrence. \"Why shouldn't I take 'em in hand regularly ? Once a week they could get away, I suppose, if I stood expenses.\" \"Certainly,\" said the vicar. \u2022- But it would be a business affair,\" went on Lawrence, \" and you'd have to make them under stand that if they came they'd have to stick to work just as they've done this afternoon. I won't take 'em out to fool.\" \" But it would mean a great deal of expense and bother, and take up a great deal of your time too.\" Lawrence looked at him squarely and laughed. \"Well, you \u2014 you won't mind my saying so, but that's my affair.\" I'll think over it and work it all out and see what I can do.\" Mr. Phillips laughed too at Lawrence's \" im penetrability.\" \" I think we shall find our tea ready by this time,\" he said. Tea was read}*, in a large bare room in the \"retreat,\" and the children introduced set to with a will. David found himself in his element at last now that ithere was some serving to be done. He had been sadly at a loss most of the day. He was too old to romp and too inexperienced in the ways of these little girls, who seemed at the same time so very foolish and so old for their years, to know how to amuse them at all. But he had appro priated to himself one who had a fearful cough and seemed disinclined or unable to join the rest, and"], [265, "ANOTHER PICNIC 247 having bought her several cheap and gorgeous aniline-dye-coloured penny toys had sat under a tree and nursed her through the afternoon, telling her the most wonderful Welsh myths, which she could not in the least appreciate, until she fell asleep in his arms. After tea the children were marshalled and counted and packed into the brakes again, with rather more difficulty than at first, for there was nothing but their sense of gratitude to appeal to now that the day's treat was over ; and with much hurrahing and waving of handkerchiefs the procession set off homewards. But the clamour did not last so long as before, for they were getting tired and sleepy. Lawrence was tired and sleepy too, and glad to be able to sit and doze even in the crowded brake. And as he sat half dreaming his eyes grew wist ful with the memory of the return from that other picnic not so very long ago, though it seemed months, and in spite of his efforts to force it away the face of Doris came again and again looked down upon him ; as he thought wistfully too. He was quite thankful when, nearing home, the children woke up again and recommenced their distracting screaming. Mr. Phillips parted from him at the schoolrooms. \" Don't think them ungrateful,\" he said mean ingly, as he shook Lawrence's hand. \" I did not tell them to whom they are indebted for this outing.\" \" You do not know you see,\" Lawrence re plied in warm appreciation of the vicar's tact and"], [266, "248 LAWRENCE WESTERTON intelligence. \" I will write about that cricket busi ness in a day or two. It's very good of you to have come and shown me how. Good night.\" From the East to the West ! Lawrence felt as if he ought to undergo some sort of quarantine or disinfecting process before he was fit to pass west of Euston. And yet people spent their lives in that sort of atmosphere and begrimed themselves every day. He should get used to it in time of course. It was rather despicable to allow himself to be affected by it. After all if that were the only sort of dirt upon him he would be less unfit for Doris' presence than he was, incomparably less. So his first attempt was over. And the profit \u2014 where was the profit ? Did it lie in bodily weariness ? Perhaps \u2014 more than perhaps ; there seemed no other profit for him. He was uncon scious of seeling that it had done more than weary him. Disloyalty and selfishness again ! What was it in him that always put self first in his thoughts ? Those poor thoughtless pale-faced children with their unchildish looks and language, had it profited them ? They seemed to have no appreciation for the country for itself. Epping Forest was a bigger place to run about in than the filth-strewn alleys and courts, bigger but not sweeter to them. How he pitied them because they could not understand ; nay more, because, if they could understand, under standing would but bring discontent. How he pitied them ! Yet surely it were better that they should grow"], [267, "ANOTHER PICNIC 249 discontented ; discontent might lead, if multiplied, to the checking of London's growth in the long run. Who were they who knew and had thought it all out? These could not understand because they had seen so little ; but those who lived their lives in pure air among the fields, did they understand the more ? Did they love the country because it was good ? Very few. It was but human blindness after all \u2014 every where ; and who could open their eyes ? He was very tired. Had she fully considered this before she made him promise, or was her thought for the effect upon himself, some wonderful effect to be wrought by months or years of this sort of thing ? Partly it must have been, though he was ashamed to think that now. Yet where was his faith in her wisdom if he could think that it was for himself and not for them ? How could he doubt that it was good for them to be taken out when she had told him to take them out ? He had done them good. No, she had done them good, and through him ! Was there no profit in being her minister of good ? He was very tired. Tired out ! Thank Heaven \u2014 and her for that !"], [268, "CHAPTER XVII SETTLING TO IT I do not propose to notice Lawrence's doings during the next month or so more than very briefly, for the treats and expeditions to which he gave on an average two days a week did not vary much in character. He went out with schools of all sorts, bands of hope, and children from various \" homes,\" and sometimes with simple waggon-loads of the waifs and strays collected for him from the slums and gutters : and the arrangements connected with these outings took up much of his time besides. Then as his operations became known, there arose necessity for examination and selection, and dealing with depredators. Among the clergy and lay workers of the east he did not become very popular personally. They could appreciate his help, but the helper was a taciturn puzzle \u2014 self-willed too, obstinately independent. One man alone seemed to understand him thoroughly, and to him Lawrence gave more than to any other. This was Mr. Phillips. There was an absence of inquisitiveness over what did not"], [269, "SETTLING TO IT 251 concern him, a respect for Lawrence's motives, what ever they might be, about the vicar, and a silent straightforward readiness to make the best and think the best of everything and everyone and leave others to do the same, that won Lawrence's reverence and gratitude, and made his work in that particular parish more pleasant than anywhere else. When a man, however naturally selfish, does set himself to work he feels a disagreeable sense of rebuff if his fellow labourers refuse to ignore the self he is endeavouring to forget ; and when he lays his hand to any particular rope all he asks is liberty to pull as well as he may. Mr. Phillips asked no questions, he took Lawrence as he found him and let him pull ; and Lawrence pulled the better for being allowed to pull in silence, as every man does. The mutual good fellowship inseparable from common labour and unspoken trust grew up between them. But among the children Lawrence did make many friends. They rather feared him at first until he learned to smile upon them ; and even then their fear changed to awe rather than affection for the man who had power (and exercised it too) to countermand a whole expedition when he found out that some of them had obtained leave to go by lying, and who, it became known, had bearded Old Tom (so called after his indispensable) in his dismantled attic den, and had seated himself there every day for a fortnight, in spite of said Tom's sodden threats of ' having the law of him ' and variously violent endeavours to realise an Englishman's"], [270, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 252 rights in his own besotted person, while the miser able children there ate up the meal brought them in a brief-bag. Lawrence went his own way without concerning himself with consequences or approved methods, and was a doubtfully acceptable person to district visitors. Perhaps he gave more indiscriminate monetary assistance than he should have done ; but no one ventured to tell him so directly, and hints were quite thrown away upon him. The children of course fully appreciated his seemingly unlimited command over swings and donkeys on treat days, and to a certain degree the equity with which these delights were administered, though they never rightly understood why he always refused to buy them the \" beastly muck \" they were so fond of, or why his language which as a rule resembled that of their school-teachers or such of the quality as they knew, should sometimes suddenly liken itself to that of their fathers and mothers, and in the presence of the cloth too. I am afraid that part of his popularity, with the boys at all events, was due to this not unfrequent dis regard of the feelings of their pastors and masters, and that he sometimes took a small delight in scan dalising those of the \" preachey-preachey \" denom ination by such means. The cricket club which he organised was his greatest success. Every Saturday afternoon he took about a dozen of Mr. Phillips' boys by train to Chingford (there are places about there where you may find a decentish pitch, though do not tell the"], [271, "SETTLING TO IT 253 golf-professional that I have said so) and bowled to them. After the first once or twice he found out that a few were disposed to treat the matter from the point of view desired, weeded out loafers and substituted others ; and though these afternoons tired him more than whole days of ordinary treats he was not long in coming to the conclusion that his labour was not likely to be altogether spent in vain. The London street boy is very sharp and can read character as well as, if not better than, many grown men ; he knows his master when he sees him and also where his own interest lies. To do these boys justice they grew to value Lawrence for his own sake as well as for the regular cricket he provided, and regarded being taken out by him as an honour not to be treated too lightly. They never indeed came to look upon the game with the country boy's business-like seriousness, but they learnt to respect it enough for practical purposes, and improved as time went on and Lawrence's personal influence increased. As for Lawrence himself the effect of this new sort of work upon him was inevitable. It was long before he began to take any real pleasure in it for its own sake ; but it certainly interested him, and above all it kept him very busy. And gradually as the consciousness dawned upon him that all he did was powerless to grant him any direct and imme diate self-satisfaction he grew reconciled to regard ing the satisfaction he seemed to afford to others as a source of secondary gratification to himself not to be despised."], [272, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 254 Poor old David was utterly confounded. That his master had undergone some process of conver sion was evident from the \" way he went on now,\" from the disappearance of all Violet Vane's photo graphs from his rooms, from the visits of sundry clergymen, and particularly from the frequency of these personally conducted and necessarily un pleasant country excursions, as well as from his change of looks and a certain sullen steadfastness of resolve which had already driven all the levity out of his face. David puzzled his mind for an explanation of it all. Lawrence did not appear to go to church oftener or, rather, less unfrequently than before, he did not put on any of the outward visible signs of sudden piety, nor even abandon any portion of his vocabulary; nor did any fresh photographs appear in place of those removed. He noticed however, that above Lawrence's bedstead there had been hung up a broken piece of bent iron fencing, and that this same piece of iron fencing never required dusting. For some reason or other this became connected in his mind with the penance Lawrence was obviously undergoing. Its disreputable looks seemed to suggest the sackcloth and ashes he had read about, and the thing itself to typify the daily cross his master must have at last realised as his earthly portion. He offered to take it round to the smith's to have it bent straight and brightened up, hoping that his request might bring about some explanation ; but Lawrence only stared at him for a minute and then told him that on no account was"], [273, "SETTLING TO IT 255 it to be moved or meddled with, and he was left to theorise afresh discomfited. Of course one of his theories was that Lawrence had fallen in love during that Dartmoor holiday ; but that did not wholly commend itself to him, for amongst Lawrence's letters he never found any in feminine handwriting ; though he scrutinised all the envelopes carefully before delivery ; and that his young master could have been rejected never entered the proud old man's head. There was nothing for him but to wait and watch, and he did both anxiously. Lawrence frequently allowed him to accompany the country excursions; but from them David learned nothing much beside what he knew already, that his master was changed, and, as time went on, that the change seemed likely to be permanent ; which on the whole tended to make the faithful old servant anything but happy ; for the abiding gloom it had produced did not seem to him a healthy condition of mind for any young man, however earnest and charitable he might become. So Lawrence worked on perseveringly with a submission to the inevitable more or less patient, and sometimes even began to fancy himself moder ately content. But there were times when in spite of himself and all his resolutions his thoughts would wander back to Dartmoor, and as he sat at Lincoln's Inn poring over dreary law papers or in his rooms of an evening he would suddenly start up to find that he had been brooding and dreaming and brooding, and with an oath he would throw"], [274, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 256 aside his work and rush madly out into the Park, to tear up and down until he had recovered his courage and stifled despair anew for a while. Sometimes the fit would drive him eastwards, or he would dash up to Mr. Phillips and ask for any thing to do in order to escape from himself, to take a tired teacher's place in the school for a couple of hours, or do any of the vicar's business or correspondence, or even go round with messages. And Mr. Phillips without showing a trace of sur prise would set him on to something at once, and make him feel that life was worth living again if only to have hit upon such a friend. There were times too when in utter weariness of body and mind the temptation would come upon him to return to his old haunts and renew his acquaintance with the so-called pleasures of life in London, which he had despised even before he had learned to loathe them, to lay aside all this Quixotic labour and cease to worry himself for the sake of a dream of the past. But this was hardly so much a temptation as a picture his remorse happened to paint at the time of a just possible alternative. He never considered it seriously. It was just possible, so was to be guarded against, that was all. He was not mad, only depressed, depressed with a weight that was every week growing more tolerable, depressed because he could not see whither the road he trod was leading him, nor at present bring himself to walk there calmly and cheerfully, with nothing for encouragement but the mile-stones of the months to look forward to. And"], [275, "SETTLING TO IT 257 again and again he grumbled and growled because he could not go on working continually like a machine until the spring broke or the fuel gave out, but must pause to rest \u2014 and think. One Sunday he went down to the sea to visit the Home for Convalescents by way of a change, and spent the day with some of the children on the beach. He learned somewhat down there of the value of sea air and decent food and such like, and came back with a dozen schemes in his head. His experience of London child-life had been short enough by that time, but it enabled him to form rough estimates. Now .\u00a31900 a year is a very decent competence and will go a long way, even if spent on charity, for ten shillings will keep a child in the country for a fortnight ; but it would have been wholly inadequate to provide all the sea air that Lawrence longed to turn it into as he came back to town that Sunday evening. Here was a wa}* to spend money on wholly unmixed good. I should not like to say how much of his .\u00a31900 Lawrence resolved should henceforth be devoted to this object, for the first enthusiasm he had known for a long time came upon him and made him feel reckless ; but the result of that visit was that a very fair portion of his income did become transformed into sea air every year, and that he never regretted the transformation of one single penny. Think of the children first : that had been her advice, and of its wisdom he was gaining know ledge fast. r"], [276, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 258 These little stunted, sallow-faced, cunning-eyed children gave him quite enough to think about. He had never been fond of children ; a defect of character often pondered over with regret ; but he had scorned to affect that \u00e6sthetic admiration for a simplicity that failed to move him and the baby wisdom that he could not appreciate, which many assume in order to be counted among the great hearted and philosophic. But these children were neither simple nor (by consequence) wise, and drew him on to love them by force of their want of conformity to all poetic or philosophic standards. Contrariness may be mistaken for honesty, but as a matter of fact Lawrence was all the more attracted because he felt he might approach them without wonder and praise, as over beings nearer heaven than earth, or critical delight, as over some exquisite art treasure ; but simply with pity. Pity for ugliness of mind or body comes easier than worship for beauty or innocence ; perhaps because it necessitates activity. And we do take more pleasure in exerting ourselves to help than in growing wise by contemplation after all. Precociously worldly and often precociously wicked they perplexed Lawrence dreadfully. He strove to understand. The cause seemed as much as anything incapacity for love. And though that was accountable, there was nothing to appeal to to bind them to any desired course of behaviour but the prospect of material benefit or the fear of punishment, hateful though he felt punishment to"], [277, "SETTLING TO IT 259 be ; if only for the reason that they exercised their wits so continually to evade it. They did not love much because they had never been loved much and the struggle for life had come upon them so early. They exercised their wits to escape punishment because (here lay a clue) they found they could escape it so, at least in part. He thought over this. He did not see how he could excite their love very well, he did not understand that ; but he felt that he could do much towards rendering any punishment threatened unavoidable ; and that he proceeded to do in an apparently utterly merciless manner. He pitted his ingenuity against theirs, with the advantage on his side, necessarily, with trouble. Any small victory gained by them was immediately followed by retaliation on his part out of all proportion. He never admitted a subsequent qualification on his own part of any announcement, nor allowed compassion to weaken authority for a moment in their eyes. They should be made to know that cajolery, excuses, or even self-interested apologies were powerless to affect the least im portant decision ; he sternly resolved that, and strove to be just, but at all events absolutely in exorable. Half the difficulties their friends and teachers experienced seemed to him to arise from the pity which discounted their reputation for firm ness and introduced uncertainty. They gave com mands and were disobeyed only because the children had learnt (he considered) to count the accompanying threats as unmeaning, because they"], [278, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 260 knew that the carrying of them out cost more trouble than did forgiveness, because the frequent display of mistaken lenity had gradually convinced them that extenuating circumstances might be safely relied on to mitigate the severity of any sentence, even when its very justice could not be derisively questioned. He would have none of that. All his punishments came without warning ; if justice was questioned or attempt at evasion followed, they took novel and alarming forms. He had derived useful hints from the law books, as for instance that the certainty of slight punishment is more effective than the severest threats which are uncertain, or, in his case, only capable of being carried out by the help of the policeman round the corner. His method was not unsuccessful. It was open and intelligible without calculation, and the quick witted little folk were not long in forming conclu sions about the man who did what he said he would, if only just for that reason ; who was never exasperated into sudden outbursts of unexpected severity ; who detected falsehood and deceit appa rently so easily (they never knew what pains he took to do so) ; and who would never overlook the least attempt to impose upon him. It all gave him an infinitude of trouble at first, but it saved him much afterwards ; and it certainly saved them trouble too, which was what he most desired, the trouble of devising useless lies and excuses. And by-and-bye, as they found that in spite of all his sternness he could romp with them with"], [279, "SETTLING TO IT 261 entire abandonment of dignity and disregard for his clothes, they came to welcome him amongst them with a curious mixture of awe and delight. Mr. Phillips heard with bewilderment that Lawrence had been observed helping to turn skipping ropes some evenings, and that the quantity of marbles in the neighbourhood was largely due not to gift but to the triumph of native dexterity over theoretical science in the open gutters. He kept what he heard to himself however. Lawrence was not afraid of looking ridiculous here, and partly because he was unconscious of the sort of enthusiasm which invites people to proclaim their defiance of the world's mockery upon all possible occasions, he never hesitated to act as if he were possessed with it, out of his own queer perversity. So he worked and theorised and played and laughed at himself and loathed himself for laugh ing and struggled to live the life he had set before him and learned more than he had ever learned of the lives of others in the process and fretted and fumed at his fate at intervals and smiled and thanked Heaven knows whom for it at other intervals for about two months."], [280, "CHAPTER XVIII OF SELF-DENIAL, POWER, AND FAITH It was the first week in August, and the moor lay scorched into colourlessness beneath the summer sun. The streams were barely trickling in their narrowed beds ; the trout lay in hiding under the stones and waited for the rain ; the birch leaves rustled like bits of dry paper up above them and waited for the rain ; and the birds sat silent, heed less of the drowsy hum of the insects ; for they were waiting for the rain too. Along the glaring road that led up from the village Mr. Wren was walking towards Barrowdown, with his eyes fixed on the hot powdered granite, thinking \u2014 thinking of Doris. He had received a letter that morning which had set him thinking very hard indeed. He had thought about Doris a great deal lately, but this letter had brought him to a crisis in his life; and he was going forth to try his fortune, after his own fashion. He had learned to love her so deeply in a quiet undemonstrative way, and was beginning to feel that she knew it."], [281, "OF SELF-DENIAL, POWER, AND FAITH 263 That she loved him as a friend and a brother he never doubted, but lately the hope had been re kindled in his heart that she might be able to love him more fully than that ; and he had deter mined to find out now for certain \u2014 after his own fashion. No one who watched her so carefully as he did could fail to see that Lawrence Westerton's visit had cast a shadow upon her life. All her gaiety had departed with him. He had evidently caused her a great sorrow, which she had patiently set herself to bear, and was bearing with all the strength and sweetness of her soul. So much the parson had read, and something of the rest he could guess at pretty easily. If Lawrence could cause her sorrow she must have loved him. She never mentioned him ; there was something between them. What was that something? Could it be overlooked ? Was it permanent ? Had it divided them altogether ? He was seeking an answer to these questions to-day, and indirectly through that answer the answer to the prayer of his own life also, that he himself might be permitted to comfort her. He had been sorely tempted. Since the morning he had wrestled, through the hot school hours he had wrestled ; and won. And now he was going to her as to an execu tioner with the warrant for his own execution in his pocket. He felt that it was so. It was that letter ; a letter like other letters he received two or three times a year from the man with whom he had"], [282, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 264 laboured as curate before he came to Dartmoor, full of talk of comfort and work and advice and news as between old friends and fellow-workers : and that man's name was Hartley Phillips. The Trepinnocks were going to Scotland in a few days now, and before they went he had resolved to speak to her. For a month past he had resolved to speak to her, and had only put off the time in order to allow her sorrow to fade away, if that might be, before he did so. But they would be away for more than two months, and he could not put it off till they came back. For the last week he had been considering how he should speak, and now this letter had come and made his way all too sadly clear. Yes in spite of temptation to \" mind his own business \" it was quite clear. He had nearly brought himself to speak yester day when he saw her in the village ; the smile she had given him had brought the words stumbling to his lips ; and yet he had felt somehow that it were better to pause and wait, and he was glad he had done so now ; she might have just possibly given him a hope that would have made his duty to-day more difficult to do. When he came within sight of Barrowdown he sat down on a stone by the road-side, and took out his letter to read once more before he met her. In it was this paragraph : \u2014 \" I have had a blessing given me this spring beyond anything I could have hoped for. It has come in the shape of a young barrister, Lawrence Westerton by name. He is evidently a boy with a"], [283, "OF SELF-DENIAL, POWER, AND FAITH 265 story, but that story I have not tried to discover. I don't think I could learn much of it from him if I did. He is a very silent, reserved, almost morose, person, and came to me last Whitsuntide, in answer to an advertisement, asking me to allow him to work amongst the children here. He works like a horse and in the most extraordinary way. He has organised a cricket club for me with tremendous success, and is continually taking some of my smaller charges out into the country. He helps me in the schools too and in a hundred ways about the streets and homes in my parish, and his clear head and common sense are of the greatest assistance. He never demands any recognition, which is, I ought to confess to my shame, an unusual source of easiness to me. You know how hard gratitude is to express adequately. I really don't know what I should do without him now ; and how he finds time for it all I'm sure I don't know, for I am not the only one he helps as the Ragged School Union and our old friend Tom Bowen could tell you amongst others. He has not a scrap of false pride though he seems to be tolerably high up in the world and very well off, judging by what he spends here at least. Altogether he is a puzzle. I never knew a young man with such a set stern sadness on his face ; the hardness in his eyes is sometimes quite pitiful to see. I think you would get on well with him, for I know your old objection to those who will talk. I allow him to go his own way, for the very good reason that he will not be told, and thank God for him every day of my life. He can smile"], [284, "266 LAWRENCE WESTERTON at times though, at least so the children say.\" Then on to other matters. He read it through. He was going to show it to Doris. There was no need to show it to Doris. That had been his temptation. She probably knew all about it. Why show it ? Would there not be even an impertinence in intruding himself by show ing it ? But she might not know of it, and there seemed to him a connection betwen Lawrence's present conduct and Doris' sadness which he might not ignore. And on her knowledge there also seemed to him to depend certain matters concern ing himself. The letter might do away with the necessity for speaking about his own love after all. It were best to show it her. He would know for certain then. But it had been a sore temptation \u2014 just to omit to do this little thing, which after all might be so very unnecessary. And as he sat thinking he never saw that Doris herself was coming up the hill behind him, for his eyes were fixed on Barrowdown. Her greeting startled him and he crumpled up the letter and thrust it into his breast pocket. \" I saw you on ahead as I left Mrs. French's and have chased you all the way from the village,\" she cried with a smile as he rose ; \" how fast you walk ! \" \" I was coming to see you, Miss Trepinnock,\" he said, \" for I have something to show you.\" It was as well to tell her at once before the temptation came upon him again, the stronger for her presence. \" And what is that ? \" she asked. She saw from his air that something was amiss."], [285, "OF SELF-DENIAL, POWER, AND FAITH 267 \" Only a letter I received this morning from my old friend Phillips,\" he replied. \" You have heard me speak of him often. I was his pupil and then his curate before he went to London. He has a living in some part near Islington and is pretty busy, but he still finds time to write to me occa sionally.\" \" And what is it about ? \" she asked, mystified. \" Read it,\" he said, taking out his crumpled letter, \" this paragraph.\" She took it, and as she read he watched her face as anxiously as the shipwrecked sailor might watch the sail in the offing. But there was nothing to induce hope or fear. She read it through quite calmly. She was flushed with walking, so there was no change of colour. But when she had finished she folded the letter up and looked into the distance, then into his face. \" Give it to me,\" she said, \" if there is nothing in it that I may not read.\" \" Nothing,\" he said, \" please keep it.\" \" Mr. Wren,\" she went on, \" I should like to, for I want to think over it.\" \" Then you have heard nothing of this before, Miss Trepinnock ? \" \" No. How should I ? \" He had thought that was possible, probable. He turned his eyes to the dust, and said : \" I felt I ought to show it to you at once. Don't think me intrusive. I couldn't help thinking so.\" She looked at him searchingly. \" Mr. Wren, I do not know how to thank you.\""], [286, "268 LA WRENCE WESTERTON They were silent a space, and he shuffled the dust into a ridge with his foot. And then he looked up suddenly and met her eyes full. She stretched out a hand to him, all discernment gratitude and deprecation. Amidst the whirl of thoughts excited by the letter she could fix upon this of pity first for the man who had brought it. How could gratitude implore him to say nothing now ? \" Thank you for a real friend and a great-hearted gentleman.\" He touched her hand and set off back along the road without a word. He could not trust himself to stay a moment. Then she did know that he loved her ; there was no other reason for her saying that or looking so. And now he was mad with him self for not having been able to hide his secret. She watched him for a little while ; she was near running after him to stop him and try to thank him again. But she had nothing to say to comfort him, and more words might bring the confession to his lips which was better left unsaid, for his own true sake. She had been dreading for some time past that it might come ; she had seen the unuttered onging in his face. But she could not love him ; all her love had been given elsewhere. Cast away or dishonoured, it had been given, and she had no more to give. Better to let him trudge back nobly through the dust than call him to her only to tell him what he had been man enough to understand without a word and endure without a murmur. But the tears came into her eyes as she watched him. True heart !"], [287, "OF SELF-DENIAL, POWER, AND FAITH 269 Then she turned and paced slowly down through the hot bent grass to the river's side, reading the letter over again as she went, and trying to realise calmly what its message meant for her, although indeed her heart had told her directly. She came to the water's edge and looked down into the cool still pool beneath ; its peace seemed to imbue her own soul with a triumph of quiet holy joy. It had come ; she had felt that it would come some day by some means. After the first horror of disillusion, disenchantment, had passed, and she had had time to ponder soberly over the character of the man as it had been revealed to her, she had slowly grown convinced of that which she had recognised intuitively at first, that her love had not gone out to one entirely unworthy and degraded. She had waited for the proof, and it had come. Sadly, sternly, he had set himself to work \u2014 he was working among the children \u2014 helping in the schools \u2014 in a hundred ways \u2014 he was spending his money there \u2014 he was doing good \u2014 he was trying to make his life useful \u2014 there and in other places also \u2014 because, because, because he had promised her that he would \u2014 all with never a smile except for the children (how she treasured that !), with never a word to a soul, with never a gleam of hope. He was trying to live down his shame. Ah ! could he ever do it ? And harder still to answer : could she ever stoop down to help him, now ? No, a thousand times no, her womanly pride had answered as often as that question had arisen"], [288, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 270 to torment her ; but her womanly instinct had answered yes, a thousand times yes. Was the barrier of his past to sunder them always ? Though she could never love him as she had loved him, yet she had loved him. Was she to refuse to give him the help of her love, such as it might be ? He, who had outraged womanhood and her through womanhood, he could be forgiven in Heaven, he had been forgiven. And she on earth, was she to refuse to acknowledge that he could be forgiven, because she shrank from the conclusion that acknowledgment must bring home to her \u2014 purification ? Her love, such as it was, were turned to nobler use if it could be brought to sanc tify and perfect his repentance than if its strength were spent in vain endeavour to compass its own destruction. And that such endeavour would be vain she had realised by this time with ever fresh humiliation. She had struggled, how she had struggled ! to loathe him, and learnt but to pity him instead. He had told her that night that he loved her. With his sin but newly cast aside, with the agony of his shame upon his face he had come to tell her that he loved her. Not because he wished to find the possibility of a hope, not to excuse himself or plead for forgiveness, not even because he would have her know that he was ready to take the con sequences of his own acts without a cry for mercy, and at least try to lessen her contempt. No, simply for her own sake, that, so far as he could by any"], [289, "OF SELF-DENIAL, POWER, AND FAITH 271 means, he might prove to her that her power for good was no fantastical imagination of the romantic and sentimental, but a great and holy fact ; a fact which his life should be set to prove afresh day by day, a fact which his life \u2014 she hid her face in her hands \u2014 was proving. That confession of love, coming as it did when the feeling of her own degradation in having loved him was almost more than she could bear, dis claiming as it did any intention of insulting her afresh, had caused her no fear at the time. But since then she had trembled more over the know ledge that he loved her than anything else. It seemed to claim her, bind her to dishonour, more firmly than the love she had given him herself. And yet this man might be capable of a love which it were no dishonour to take and purify. Even then he had shown her that he could under stand something of what it meant, and since \u2014 nay she was sure of it now. The rest she could teach him, if she would. And she \u2014 the woman to whom it had been given to lift him out of the dust \u2014 who was she to refuse to stretch forth her hand again to help him stand upright ? The mockery of the pessimists rang in her ears : help him stand upright ! Rather fall together with him : and she thought of women who had given their love and their lives and had failed. Yes, but always came the saving clause, they had the power until they doubted it. And she did not doubt her power, only her liberty to exercise"], [290, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 272 it. Because her love had turned to pity ? The answer lay there, only the revolting nature of his sin had blinded her to it, and the human horror of contamination had been too overpowering to be endured, at first. Since she did not doubt her power, how could she refuse to exercise it ? She took her hands from her face and looked at the sapphire ring on her fore-finger, pondering over its meaning. Her brother had given it to her the week in which he went abroad, and she knew nothing. He had had it made for her. It was not an ordinary ring, for it was set all round with sapphires of equal sizes, bedded in the gold, and as nearly touching each other as possible. She had opened her eyes at its magnificence when he showed it her ; and her astonishment had been still further increased by what he said \u2014 she could remember his words now quite well and the solemnity of his looks, which so frightened her, as he spoke: \"Doris, I'm off. God knows when I shall see you again. This is for you always to wear, here,\" and he put it on the fore-finger of her right hand. \" I'm worse than a fool, but I know one thing and this is to keep that in your mind ; and remember, if any man gives it the lie, don't believe him, though he was the biggest fool of a philosopher the world ever gaped at ; for the sake of dad and yourself and all you love best in the world don't believe him. See, it's set all round with sapphires or whatever they call 'em, it don't matter so long as they're blue ; and it means;\" and"], [291, "OF SELF-DENIAL, POWER, AND FAITH 273 here he stooped and kissed her finger as he pinched it, \" that there's power in this little finger to do what it will with one chap's life at least for this world and the next, and that I've set it to point through the blue. Never take it off \u2014 promise me.\" So amazed she promised : and when Mrs. Salter came in and saw it and made some remark that brought the blood to Doris' face about its not being at all the thing a young girl ought to wear he had flared up and abused her for a meddling old idiot and gone out in a passion. Since that day Doris had never taken it off; and when her brother died had wept over it often, and wondered whether after all he had spoken truly, since she had been powerless to save his life. But she did not wonder now. How could she go on wearing it and believing unless she stooped to help Lawrence ? Help him or else take it off and cast it to the bottom of this dark pool, and cease to believe in her power for ever ; her power, which had already shown itself to be somewhat. How clear and calm the pool was beneath her, how deep ! Clear and calm as her decision. Where her love had been given, there, such as it was, should it rest. Please God, pity should overcome her abhorrence of the thought of ever yielding herself to him. All her effort should be put forth to save him, guide him ; and time should prove whether honour for labour done and love purified might not blot out remembrance of love dishonoured and defiled. s"], [292, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 274 She herself would have to make the first move. That he could be so base as to come to her, to think of coming to her, she did not believe ; she had reason to trust his word now. She must go to him. Why shudder at the thought ? Shudder ing was over. In a few days she would be passing through London. Too soon, too soon. He should have more than two months' work to show her. If she thought it possible that he could not work for more than two months she would not dream of going to him at all. As she came back ? That would make five months since he left, or nearly. Three months more ! Time the healer might do much in three months ; Time the destroyer too. As she valued herself so would he value her. She could not go before then. It was neither vanity nor wish to try him that held her back, but pride and faith. She stooped down kneeling on the brink and looked at her sunny face reflected in the pool close beneath ; lower still she stooped and kissed her own lips in the water; and drank. She stood upright, straight and strong, thankful and believing ; and walked back home, in her hand the letter crushed against the sapphires of the ring."], [293, "CHAPTER XIX AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE Mr. Wren walked back through the dust to the vicarage. Loyal to the backbone he took his un spoken rejection without a sigh of complaint. His only thought was how best he could serve her ; and since it was not at all agreeable to his dis position to remain inactive he took upon himself, what many wiser men than he have done before him, the dangerous task of interfering with other people's business. His first effort in that line had been so distinctly successful. Foolish no doubt, but pardonable under the circumstances ; the con sciousness of having done our duty disposes us sometimes to see if we cannot do a wee bit more. He went round by the Bakers' to ascertain Law rence's address ; he decided to write to him. He was genuinely glad to hear of the help Lawrence had given his old friend, anxious that he should know it as well as anxious to do any thing in his power towards effecting reconciliation between him and Doris ; and to make it evident that she was acquainted with the circumstances seemed"], [294, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 276 to him the natural and best thing to do. They evidently had no direct communication with each other. Why should he not act as go-between ? So he wrote to Lawrence explaining how he had heard from Mr. Phillips \u2014 how fortunate it was that Lawrence had been directed to his old master of all men \u2014 how he was confident that it would be for the benefit of them both and more besides \u2014 and wound up by saying that he had shown the letter to Doris and that she seemed very glad too. He mentioned incidentally that she and her father would be pass ing through London in a few days, when no doubt he would be seeing them. He remembered Lawrence saying that he should be away then and thought it kind to tell him this in case he might wish to stay to see them and did not know the exact date. And that letter did more towards the unmaking of Lawrence Westerton than could possibly have been expected. It brought him a hope which no one had a right to give him except Doris herself. This arose by misconstruction. He read more than mere friendliness in Wren's letter ; he read a purpose. He was unaware how much Wren knew. Doris herself might have prompted him to write. Naturally she would not write herself. He could not regard it as altogether uninspired. \" No doubt he would be seeing them.\" That meant that Doris had mentioned seeing him to Mr. Wren. It never occurred to him that if Wren was ignorant of the whole circumstances that was a very natural expres sion to use,"], [295, "AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE 277 The bad effect of this letter was obvious from the first, for he could do absolutely nothing for two whole days after receiving it but think about it; and then he plunged back into his work with a wild joy that was hardly justified by Wren's remarks, unguarded though they were, and took hope for certainty, as all of us are apt to do on occasion. He neglected to consider whether Doris' gladness might not have another meaning besides the one he understood by it, or that even if it meant nought else that she might possibly hesitate before ad mitting as much. It was very natural. He had never counted upon the possibility of such a hope, and when the possibility was suddenly presented to him he took it for more than probability at once. Now he had been working very well for nothing, or, to put it plainer, for the sake of an ideal ; and it would have been far better for him if he had been permitted to go on doing so. He had given up looking for any present reward at once and for ever and was fast growing reconciled to doing without it. And here it was dangled before his eyes again ! His life was immediately thrown into a confusion of anxiety and anticipation and thankfulness and awe. His mental equilibrium was all upset. He was blinded and stunned. Doris ! Doris ! Relenting, forgiving. An un speakable dread came upon him and made him tremble as the certainty of his loss had never done. If he could have doubted whether it was right for him to accept her forgiveness when she offered it,"], [296, "278 LAWRENCE WESTERTON together with all that such a forgiveness implied, he might have been able to consider the position more calmly and deliberately. But he could not refuse it ; as well might the sinner refuse the for giveness of God. Humbly reverently and grate fully he must accept it, though his gratitude could never be fully expressed nor his humility and reverence be sufficient. He had asked for nothing by word or deed. Anything she offered would be offered of her own free will. And his faith in her was altogether too great to allow him to imagine for a moment that she could offer him anything it were dishonour for him to accept at her hands. Dishonour would lie rather in a refusal which implied such a doubt. But he shuddered for dread of his joy all the same. He spent a week in a perfect fever of longing ; but as the days went by and no news arrived a chill fear came and gripped at his heart and a horrible doubt that he had misconstrued Wren's letter after all. Of course she would be glad to hear of his work. Her cold charity could include him as well as others. She was too womanly to hate him and not feel thankful that he had forsaken his old life. Did it mean that after all, and only that ; and had Wren no authority for his suggestion of a possible meeting in London ? The twelfth of August came and passed and the thirteenth and the fourteenth and the fifteenth too before the full realisation of his agonising mis take burst upon him ; and then he knew what he had done. He had thrown away his peace of mind"], [297, "AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE 279 in exchange for a hope as groundless as the folly of man could have permitted. And now there was nothing for it but to reconcile himself afresh to the dull hopeless drudgery of the last two months. Small wonder that he felt that his punishment was more than he should be able to endure for very much longer. Oh ! it was hard, so very hard \u2014 and just. And the worst of it was that he could not bring himself to regard his labour as entirely hopeless now. He could not rid himself of the idea that somewhere in the dim suture there might even yet be a possibility ; and that was just sufficient to make and keep him utterly wretched. He had been taken at a disadvantage. She knew now that he had kept his promise. That gave him hope ; the unreasonableness of the hope, his clinging to it made him despise himself; and yet he clung. It was as unmanly as it was unwise to allow himself to be influenced by any considerations but those which had held him to his work so well hitherto ; but Mr. Wren's letter had meant something, it must have meant something, more than a mild congratu lation. The spell was broken, a cloud of speculations rose up and dimmed his ideal, and his peace of mind was gone. Surely mere expectationless mo notony had been better. Then he met Violet Vane. It was the beginning of September and he was sitting one evening near the boat-houses by the side of the Serpentine, pondering over what he should do when the winter came and the country excursions"], [298, "280 LA WRENCE WESTERTON grew impossible. He had grown to value them now. They were facts. He knew he was carrying out her particular wish while engaged upon them. Those two early in August, how he had enjoyed them, in anticipation of her coming ! How sur prised the children had seemed at his unusual spirits those days, how touchingly sympathetic some of them had been a day or two afterwards ! Poor mites, they too had seen that in his face which they could pity and ask to be allowed to understand. And how gruff he had been ! But very soon all that would have to be aban doned. What was to be done instead ? David 'had besought him to take a holiday and a bit of a rest for a time ; but though he had had an invitation to go shooting he had refused it, and hung on in town. Which shows how unreasonable people can be even under the influence of the greatest ideas. He ought to have seen that he was over doing the thing. Violet had been discreet, as discretion goes. She had informed herself of his return to town after that Whitsuntide holiday, and having done that had left him to himself all this while. She had bided her time. Precipitation would have but caused explosions. But she had no intention of letting him slip from her hands altogether if she could help it, without an effort to stay him. She flattered herself that she meant to have a \"look in\" yet. She had been sorry for him at the time of their parting, but afterwards she had deeply re sented his treatment and forsaking. She was piqued,"], [299, "AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE 281 she was violently jealous, and after all she had a kind of affection for him. If she meddled too early, however she knew that her chances of recovering him would be seriously impaired. He would get over the folly b}f time alone. She made her calcu lations accordingly and waited an opportunity ; and the opportunity came now and thus. He was sitting by the Serpentine, as already stated, drawing semicircles in the pathway with his stick ; and it happened that she had chartered a victoria and was driving through the park on that very day at that very hour on her way to the great emporium of the north-west, to do some economical and comprehensive shopping. She caught sight of him sitting there in an obvious state of dejected abstraction, and thought over the chance offered her. She had been wondering how best to approach him for some weeks. Here was the very chance. She considered the pros and cons rapidly as she drove past him, decided that the pros had it, and pulled up a little way further on ; danced out and was at his side before he had looked up. He had got into a habit of not looking up just lately, since that terrible disappointment ; which told a story of sense of humiliation and loss of self-respect, which the Reverend Hartley Phillips had read for one. \" Lawrence, Lawrence, you here ! \" she cried gaily, \" well, I never ! What has become of you all this while ? Now, now, don't swear. You do look ill and miserable. O Lawrence, can't I do something for you ? \""], [300, "282 LAWRENCE WESTERTON Her tone of pity\u2014 her pity ! \u2014 checked the oath directly. There was nothing for it but to be decently courteous. He rose to his feet and took off his hat. He disregarded the hand she held out to him however. \" I am afraid not,\" he said quietly. \" Lawrence, Lawrence, my dear good boy.\" Her voice was soft with entreaty as well as com passion. \" Isn't this farce about over ? \" \"Just about,\" he answered grimly; \"that is, never.\" \" Don't look like that, Lawrence. You do seem so miserable. And whatever are you doing in town this time of year ? Do you mean to say you are sticking here, wasting all the summer, just for the sake of ? \" \" I am sticking here, because \" he said, blankly. \" Well, I am sticking here.\" \" I wish I had known,\" she answered ; \" I have only just come up to town for a day or two.

I meant it. I mean it. And I'm only allowing you to stay here talking because, well \u2014 I'm not going to have a theatrical fuss. You're a woman.

I have got such an idea into my head, and I am going to stick to it in just that sort of way. That's settled once for all, and no power on earth shall move me.

They are not the only ones there, nor the first.\" She winced, but began to take them off. And as she did so he glanced curiously, uneasily into her face. Of what order was her attachment ? Had he misjudged it ? Was it above jewels after all ? He held his breath. \" See here,\" she cried, \" what would you do if I threw them down here ? \" He gave a laugh, with a gasp in it. \" They would immediately take a rather longer journey,\" he said sardonically, and pointed to the Serpentine. \" Do what you like with them, but I should advise you to put them on again and not be ridiculous. They are rather valuable. Better sell 'em.\" She wavered. The temptation to defy him was almost irresistible. But the feminine love of diamonds prevailed, and she put them into her pocket. She little dreamt what hung on the sacri fice of those few rings. She was looking at them and not the fear in his eyes. If she had seen it she might not have understood its full meaning, nor the relief at their retention. \" Yes,\" she said, \"and they had another value once. You talk of a different dress. Well, we shall see. I will keep them until I put on a different dress as you say, but it will hardly be to ask your pity. You shall beg, you shall beg for mine. We shall see. And now pick up that glove.\" He picked it up at once and handed it to her. \" I suppose that was meant for a challenge,\""], [304, "286 LAWRENCE WESTERTON he said ; \" but I hardly picked it up for that reason.\" \" Then do so now.\" And she flung it down again. \"You have made a mistake, Miss Vane. It will lie there till doom'sday for me.\" \" There let it lie then. Coward ! \" She rose and walked over towards her carriage without another word. She heard a hasty step behind her. She turned and saw his clenched fists. A recollection of Dartmoor flashed across her brain. She stopped. \" Well,\" she said coldly, without a tremor. \" Miss Vane, you are right, I am a coward ; but not for refusing to pick up that glove. I am a coward for not daring to read what I saw in your face just now ; for insulting you by misreading ; for telling you to put those rings on again.

I will make you another. There's only one real reparation that a man can make \" \u2014 his voice died away to a whisper \u2014 \" Will you marry me ? For, by God, I believe you have loved me.\" For the first time in her life Miss Violet Vane's tongue refused to utter a word. \" Yes,\" he went on, in a rapid low tone, earnest ness struggling for mastery over cynical despera tion, \" marry me.

I'll give you a week to think seriously over it, and you can write me a note. And don't think I shan't be strong enough to keep the spirit as well as the letter. I'll do all I can to honour you.

That's sickening. I make you this offer in sober earnestness, and will stand by it.\" Give Violet all the credit due to her now ; she was not found wanting. Remember that in her favour. She did not attach very much value to his offer for itself. Still it was an offer and a chance not likely to be met with again. But she saw what it had and would cost him, and, as he said, she had a heart of a sort ; and that heart told her to refuse him ; brains too to show her exactly the way to do so. She burst out laughing. She had never been so touched in her life before and was ready to cry, and instead she heroically burst out laugh ing. It was a good piece of acting ; she did not overdo it either. And as soon as she felt she could speak without betraying herself she cried :"], [306, "LA WRENCE WESTERTON 288 \" Bravo ! Go to church and be good and live happy ever after. Suit me beautifully, wouldn't it ? I always did think you the biggest fool I ever knew. Take that for your answer.\" \" God forgive you,\" was all he could say, and considering that she had just done a thing requiring as little forgiveness as anything she ever did his remark was somewhat unjustified. \" But I'll not take that for your answer until you've had more time to think.\" She had another inspiration. She assumed an air of apparent seriousness. \" Never mind, Lawrence, old boy, I appreciate your motives, and shall always respect you for this ; but really \" \u2014 here she gave a little sigh \u2014 \" it's not quite good enough for the likes of me. I might as well go into a convent at once or the hallelujah business. Thank you from the bottom of the heart you say I've got though for your splendid offer.\" Here followed a mock curtsey. Lawrence glowered down upon her. \"You will write to me all the same,\" he said. \" Certainly, sir,\" with another mock curtsey. He helped her into her carriage. She gave him a theatrical bow of forced contempt and amuse ment, then settled herself and stared straight be fore her as she drove away. She felt satisfied with herself, and her satisfac tion increased the importance of the sacrifice she had just made. Strange, she could spare him this and afterwards come to wish him the worse evil because she had spared him."], [307, "AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE 289 But Lawrence sat down on the seat and took to his semicircles again, until he had formed quite a deep trench. Then he scraped her glove into it with the end of his stick and the dust on to the top of the glove, and smoothed it all over again. \"That's a pitiful thing to do too,\" he soliloquised as he contemplated the result. \"And to think that six months ago I'd have kept the thing in a drawer among my pocket-handkerchiefs, and that now I'm going to leave it there for the satis faction of keeping my word to myself. Good Lord ! \" Wonder whether this is all slap-y our-ch est heroism or the veriest out-and-out humbug. Be lieve I only did it to get rid of this idiotic notion of hope I've got at bottom, and settle down to something, anything for certainty. \" She'll refuse ; I can see she'll refuse, and in spite of her acting I can guess why. Lawrence, old man, you're sunk pretty low when a \u2014 when Miss Violet Vane can refuse you out of pure com passion. Poor woman, I'm deuced sorry for her. I can keep an eye on her and give her a hand maybe some day. God help her ! She's got some thing to go through first.

And they saved him. He had formed a plan for the winter now. He had hired a largish room and had fitted it up with some long tables, and laid in a stock of games and a few dozen books he had bought second-hand from the book-stalls ; and was going to open it two or three times a week in the evenings as soon as November came. The children's delight in antici pation was reward enough already. All through September and far on into October he had stuck to his post. His rejection by Violet had been an escape, but an escape very mortifying. Common sense had demanded no such sacrifice as lay in his offer."], [310, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 292 Still he had made it out of a sudden wild longing to do more than common sense demanded, to make more than the reparation the world would approve; and it had been refused. It seemed as if the power of expiation were denied him. He was too morti fied and cast down to be thankful. His appearance had altered considerably for the worse. He had acquired an unkempt look, as if his clothes did not fit him. He had never been particularly handsome ; he was very far from look ing so now. There was an unhealthy hue about his sinking cheeks, and the lines were multiplying and deepening round his mouth and eyes. His whole face wore an abiding expression of restless sense of failure and yet dogged resistance, which made it very hard, almost cruel. He could not get over that disappointment ; and though the hope of ever even seeing Doris again was fast fading into unreality, he was unable to regard his fate with anything like his former resignation, or rest content with an ideal which could be dimmed and rendered inefficient so easily. He worked on now in a dull apathetic way, look ing neither forward nor backward, only because he felt that if he did not do so he might as well cut his throat at once. The work was there and he would not be beaten. He could take a little com fort too from the mere \" going on \" with its \" glory \" and \" wages.\" But he had ceased to read, almost to think, and was rapidly becoming the automaton he had longed to be at first. True there was always that dull aching in his heart, but even that was"], [311, "FALLEN AT LAST 293 grown like the pain of the castaway sailor, who is said to lose the definite consciousness of it after a while. There was nothing to long for, nothing to win, but the smile of these children. And, as it happened, that was sufficient, perhaps more than sufficient. David's entreaties that he should go away had grown quite piteous ; but they were still disregarded, as were also the suggestions of Mr. Phillips to the same effect. The worthy vicar so far forgot himself as to call him a fool one day, but was disarmed by Lawrence's immediate agreement as to that at all events. There was his assigned post he considered, and there he meant to remain. He never felt exactly ill, so that all attempts at advice or persuasion were unheeded ; and there he remained out of sheer grim obstinacy. No, it was something better than obstinacy. But as it was vacation time he yielded so far as to betake himself for long walks on odd afternoons, down along the river by Hampton Court, and through Bushey Park and elsewhere, for exercise's sake. But it was more out of consideration for poor old David's paternal anxiety that made him do so, for he looked upon them as a great waste of time. And afterwards he had good reason to repent of having conceded that much ; for it was one of those walks which led up to his final dis comfiture. But of that presently. Now all this time Miss Violet Vane had continued to exist, and consequently to feel, and"], [312, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 294 consequently to try to find expression for her feelings. For a week or more after her rejection of him she had continued satisfied with herself; then she began to repent, and longed to avail herself of his offer. But pride stood in the way. He had pitied her too. What was such pity but slight upon her character ? She resented having her atten tion called to certain matters in such a way. It interfered with her enjoyment of the present. And deep down she was conscious of defects in herself, ineradicable. She hated to think of her beauty and charm as insufficient : it was gall and wormwood to her. She began to hate the man who set their insufficiency before her. She began to wish for revenge. Then she longed to have him back again on any terms. As a preliminary to effective action it was neces sary to find out exactly how matters stood between him and \" this Trepinnock girl.\" She recognised the presence of barriers between them, but they must be rendered immovable. How to do so ? She thought of writing to the people at that \" heaven-forsaken little pub.\" on Dartmoor with a view to discovery ; but that plan was roundabout and otherwise objectionable, so did not commend itself. Only through Lawrence and possibly the papers \u2014 these Trepinnocks vvere evidently big people down in their own parts, and their names would be in the papers \u2014 could she hear about them. She went to the trouble of ordering a Devonshire Chronicle once a week to be sent her"], [313, "FALLEN AT LAST 295 and never looked at it after the first time or two. The most satisfactory way was through Lawrence. She was not hopeful however. When therefore she returned from Eastbourne she wrote to him, apologising for calling him an ass, and suggesting the possibility of future mutual esteem and friendliness on the footing of past explanations and his avowed intentions towards her. It was best to begin by hinting at cool regard as their future relationship, and in so doing to put forward a claim she calculated his chivalry would not deny. She neglected to take into account the conditions he had imposed. In answer to this letter she received a formal chill acknowledgment of the apology. That stung her out of womanly self-control. She wrote to him again, but this time she enclosed a milliner's bill for certain dresses which she identified to him by reference to his particular approval of them at the time of purchase. Her claim should be made slightly clearer. She reminded him of the con ditions under which they were purchased. She spoke of common sense and matter of fact by way of apparent apology for doing so. Although this letter disgusted Lawrence intensely, his very disgust was a comfort. It eased him to find her mercenary under the circumstances. It made the extent of her claim very much clearer, however humiliating the perception of its exact limits. In a few days she received a receipted bill direct from the dressmakers. She sent it on to Lawrence,"], [314, "296 LAWRENCE WESTERTON saying that it did not concern her. She hoped that by doing so she might exasperate him into per sonal encounter. Worrying him would necessarily do so in time, she anticipated. But as it did not seem to do so, she sought to bring this about more directly. She called upon him, and was gruffly denied information or admit tance by David. Then she wrote again, alleging insult. To this she received a somewhat lengthy reply, deliberately and formally given. If David had been rude he wished to apologise, but Miss Vane must please to understand that Lawrence was not dis posed to see her at his rooms, and that she would be refused admittance. This simply to save her the trouble of useless calling. But if she chose to do so, information would always be ready for her as to Lawrence's whereabouts if she desired to see him on business matters. He was confident that after what had passed she would not court repetition of refusal by referring to any others. Lawrence had weighed this letter carefully. It seemed to him that he could not hide from her with any self-respect. If she meant to make a nuisance of herself he must put up with it. The only possible line of conduct for him was that of dignified consideration. Firmness and perfect openness was the best weapon. The result was a question of time only. She could not injure him in any way. Morally he was proof against her, and the world mattered nothing to him.

And Violet began to recognise the futility of her efforts and raged accordingly. Her hatred grew, and with it her longing for revenge. Revenge, however, seemed impossible. She could only strike him through the girl, and her knowledge of the barriers remained as indefinite as ever. What could she do ? Imagine therefore her state of interested per plexity on seeing one morning towards the end of October an announcement in the Morning Post that Mr. and Miss Trepinnock had arrived at Tad brooke's for a few days on their way from Scotland to Devonshire. She instantly attached a meaning to this. She began to think and plan. But beyond a wild notion of the advisability for her own purposes of being \"awake and around\" generally at this junc ture she could decide upon nothing much. But she went and \" called for information \" at Lawrence's rooms in the morning. David told her he was at Lincoln's Inn, in a stiff and pompous manner. In the afternoon he was going for a walk in Richmond Park. She went to address given at Lincoln's Inn. She had just missed him. He had had an early lunch and gone. Richmond Park ? She was going for a drive with some friends that afternoon. She would ask them to drive down there too. It was a chance just possible."], [316, "298 LAWRENCE WESTERTON It was a fine Saturday afternoon. The cricket excursions had had to be abandoned by this time to Lawrence's great regret. He took the train to Wimbledon, and walked up the hill and across the common over to the park. He turned in at the Robin Hood gate, and up across the withered sodden grass. The bracken was all mottled and tangled and bent, and the oaks turned rusty brown, while the chestnut leaves had already fallen, dried and crumpled. Winter was hard at hand, and the sun seemed to glory in the ruin around and anxious to show it up in its most glaring colours. Law rence looked and did not bless David for sending him out into this vision of death and decay. It worked upon him so that he longed to throw himself down and call for the Deliverer too. Oh those autumn days ! They have been sung of once as they will never be again. Sad and strange and sweet and wild \u2014 the feeling they inspire how undefinable, inexpressible it is ! And yet how marvellously and beautifully that song has expressed it all ! Only to one or two in our lives can we ever show that we also have understood it and wept for it ; and then how inarticulately ! With a glance or a tone we can show it, just once or twice, and then it is shrouded away into the depths of our hearts again, lest we cease to be men. Lawrence had no one to whom to glance or utter the whisper of comprehension ; but he sat down by the ponds and repeated the words to himself, and the tears rose into his eyes. The tears have risen into your eyes if you have felt those same words."], [317, "FALLEN AT LAST 299 Then he cursed David again and began throwing pebbles into the pond. There was something humanly wanton in throwing pebbles into the pond that distracted him comfortably. The comfort did not endure. He got up and walked on. He avoided going to the crest of the hill \u2014 the sight of the Thames valley in this golden glow would be rather more than he could bear in his present mood \u2014 and kept to the path until he came to the gate in front of the \" Star and Garter.\" And there he leant back against the railings and watched the carriages. The fine afternoon had brought a good many out in spite of the lateness of the season. He noticed that some of the people stared curiously at him. Well, he knew he was looking ill ; David told him that often enough. They might stare and welcome ; it did not matter to him. Nothing did now. An old gentleman passed him on a tricycle, and coming to the gate put his brake on hard. For a moment he seemed to be hesitating whether he should get off or go on valiantly down the slope amongst the carriages. He was evidently an inexperienced rider, and his comic distrust of himself and final decision to extricate himself from the machine in spite of his inability to stop it first engaged Lawrence's attention, and diverted him so much that he failed to notice a party of three strolling along behind him over the grass towards the gate. But his ear caught the following words, and he turned with a start :"], [318, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 300 \" It is \u2014 no it isn't \u2014 yes, by George ! it is Lawrence Westerton. Well, I'm dashed if I should have known you, old man.\" Lawrence faced and looked through the speaker. \" Hullo, Bossington,\" he said indifferently. Archie Bossington of the Cambridge days, Archie Bossington of subsequent rivalry in admiration of Violet Vane and general Bohemian experience in common ; an acquaintance altogether dropped latterly. Beside him stood two ladies, one un known to Lawrence, the other Violet Vane, con gratulating herself on the fortune of war, wildly debating how to turn it to the best advantage, outwardly composed and smiling, as if slightly amused. \" Great Scott, man ! \" continued Archie, \" come and have a drink. You look as if you wanted a tall one if ever man did.\" And he caught hold of Lawrence's arm. \"Thanks, no,\" said Lawrence stiffening. Archie let go his arm and stared. Then he caught hold of it again. \" Don't tell me ; just you come along. It'll be coroner's inquests and shutters and things.\" \" You forget,\" put in Violet, scornfully considerate, \" that Mr. Westerton has no vices.\" She raised her head, and drew up a lip, and glanced along her nose. \" Oh ! \" laughed Archie, \" never mind. We've enough left for that. Come and have a drink for old times' sake. Why it's \u2014 Lord knows how long \u2014 since I saw you. You're never around now.

Anyway let me introduce you to Miss Fotheringay.\" The other lady swept an appropriate curtsey, with a reflection of Violet's scorn in it. Lawrence was intensely annoyed. Violet might have spared him and herself this. To simply bolt suggested prudery with an umbrella, hermits with skirts up. He was not going to play the part of any sort of superior saint before these people. Indifference came handiest. The encounter was disagreeable, unavoidable ; but to go through with the consequences might teach Violet a useful lesson. \" Right you are,1' he said, \" if you're so deuced keen. Only don't hang on to my arm as if I was an escaped convict. Do you think I'm going to trouble myself to run ?\" with a glance of cool defiance at Violet. Violet tittered, and they walked down to the hotel. Archie ordered fruit and champagne, and pro ceeded to make himself vastly entertaining. \" Well,\" he said after a while, turning to Lawrence, \" and where the dickens have you been hiding away all this while ? Continent or what ? It might be hard labour from your looks.\" \" Don't ask awkward questions,\" Violet broke in. \" Lawrence has been very seriously engaged lately \u2014 in the matrimonial line \u2014 and all that, don't you know.\" \" Miss Vane is naturally somewhat amused,\""], [320, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 302 said Lawrence imperturbably. He declined to be irritated into even avoiding the subject. \"How are things progressing?\" asked Violet. She wished to measure the effect of the arrival of the Trepinnocks in town. As Lawrence did not answer, she turned to the others and remarked : \" The girl won't have him, you know. It's all most romantic and sensational. Of course he's rather mortified. Doesn't he look it ? \" \" Cause and effect,\" acquiesced Lawrence. \" Miss Vane's discernment is never at fault.\" His coolness was insufferable. \" But he's dreadfully set upon marrying and settling down. He's been reading high-flown lite rature, you see, and has begun to consider himself a very holy young man. Why,\" she hesitated at her own brutality, then spurned it, and went on with a laugh, \" he came to me for pity, asked me to have compassion upon him, as she wouldn't.\" It was a heartlessly cruel way of putting it, but Lawrence never even winced. \" And Miss Vane,\" he added quietly, \" was too good-natured to entertain the proposal.\" Why does it only madden some people to bear witness to their possession of a heart ? Nothing he could have said could have irritated her half so much, implying as it did, too, a confession on her own part of lack of moral requisites. \" Some men,\" she said, \" have a way of flinging things at your head which makes you bound to refuse them. I really have no need of anybody's second-hand affections. Besides, it wouldn't have"], [321, "FALLEN AT LAST 303 been fair to take advantage of him then. He didn't seem quite \u2014 quite \u25a0\" She pointed at the cham pagne bottle. \" All things considered, I think I kept my temper pretty well.\" Lawrence gazed at her deliberately. He said nothing in correction. \" So don't give him more than two glasses, Archie,\" went on wanton flippancy, \" or he'll be proposing to Phyllis in a minute.\" And she burst into a little low peal of laughter. Lawrence took up the paper lying on the next table. It was the Morning Post. A notion came into her head that took her breath away. \" Perhaps it's as well to hide your face, Law rence,\" she cried. \" But you don't want to see that ; you saw it this morning, didn't you ? \" \" I don't happen to have seen this morning's paper yet,\" he said. Her breath came back. Did he know it from other sources ? She must find out. She would take it for granted that he did not. Anyhow her course was clear ; but his ignorance would make things so much easier. \" Come, Vi,\" said Archie, grown rather uncom fortable, \" shut up and behave yourself. He's not going to quarrel, you see ; and I'm not particularly set on watching people at that game, if he was. Make it up, and ask him to come to the theatre with us to-night, prettily. I'll stand supper after \u2014 there. So kiss and be friends, do.\" \" I'm sorry, Bossington,\" said Lawrence lower ing the paper, \"but you'll understand me when I say I can't come.\""], [322, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 304 \" Oh, nonsense,\" said Violet. That paper must come out of his hands somehow, and immediately. She tipped her chair, and peered round the edge. Then suddenly she snatched it out of his grasp, as if in mischief, and said sweetly : \" Now Lawrence, don't be absurd or bear malice. See I'm awful sorry. I never mean half what I say, and the other half's usually untrue. What more can you want ? It's only my poor notion of fun. Don't take it seriously. Come now.\" \"That's a good little girl,\" added Archie. \" We'll leave you to make it up. Phyllis, come out through the window and look at the view for a bit. But of course, old chap,\" he added to Lawrence, \" if you won't come to-night you won't. You know your own business best. I'll not press you.\" Miss Fotheringay and he departed on to the balcony, and Violet had rather more than thirty seconds in which to make up her mind as to what to do now. By fair means or foul she would keep Lawrence near her while these Trepinnocks were about. It was her only way. Her attempts at mortifying him had rendered nobody ridiculous but herself; he did not care a jot. That made her wilder than ever, and more than ever determined to take vengeance if she could. This Trepinnock girl in town ! He should not see her if she could prevent it. She would stay at his side, cost what it might, until her beauty had wrought upon him, and exert every power of fascination she possessed until he bowed again, and then \u2014 she would throw him aside with a laugh \u2014 or"], [323, "FALLEN AT LAST 305 perhaps forgive him ; all in the most theatrical manner possible, only her jealousy and malice were none the less real and earnest for that. This girl should learn that Violet Vane was a rather more formidable obstacle than even she imagined. It was unfortunate for Lawrence that he had not read the paper. \" I'm afraid I was very unkind, Lawrence,\" she began. \" Do please forgive me, really.\" And she held out a dainty hand beseechingly, with the most consummate affectation of real sorrow imaginable. \" Of course, Miss Vane,\" replied Lawrence at once. \"It really doesn't matter to me.\" \" Oh 1 Don't say it like that,\" she implored, with her hand on his sleeve ; and she bent down to look up into his face with eyebrows raised as if in the greatest concern. \" You know, Lawrence, you can easily see that it only means I'm awfully hurt at your refusal to be anything to me any more. But you cannot help being something to me.\" She withdrew her hand from his arm and rested her chin upon it. She dropped her eyes after a moment and began to twirl one of the glasses on the table. \"And just because I will not marry you,\" she continued with eyes still downcast ; \" because I value your happiness too much for that I am to be nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 you are determined that I shall be nothing.\" She listed her eyes again slowly and gazed steadily into his. \"Is it so?

I know, I know,\" she said with a sigh. \"We must give in when that comes.\" Her hand went up to her eyes, then down again to the cham pagne glass as if she would restrain emotion by making it revolve as rapidly as possible. She looked away to the wall and panted. And having forced the tears into her eyes she turned to him again piteously and seemed about to entreat. Her lips moved, but the words were inaudible. Lawrence watched her in mingled disgust and compassion. \"Miss Vane,\" he said presently, \"that will do. As you say we can all recognise the inevitable when it comes. And I have told you before that it is impossible for me to continue our acquaint ance.\" \" Of course,\" she murmured, \" of course. I shall learn to bear it in time. But oh ! Lawrence, in spite of it all you know you have loved me a little.\" And the recollection brought the tears into her wonderful eyes with hardly any effort at all. \" That is a subject better dropped,\" he said. \" I must bear with that,\" she continued in a little choking voice. \" But do say that you love me just a little still, ever so little, although you love this girl too.

He could hardly restrain his contempt. \" You forget yourself,\" he said hurriedly. \" No, I do not,\" and she raised her head with a sweep ; \" but we women have been driven to say worse things than that. Then you have nothing but scorn left for me \u2014 you will not come ? \" \" No.\" \" And why ? \" Desperation refused to take refusal. \" I have told you that you know the reason.\" \" You have told me what you would have me think is the reason.\" Her eyes grew fierce. \" But it is not the reason, not all the reason, not half the reason. Do you think I am blind ? Do you think I can't see what you affect to conceal under all this apparent indifference, that you are afraid of me ? Yes, afraid. You, who set up to be inspired with this great high passion, and all that is noble and good, you are afraid to stay by me an hour lest Violet Vane should jeopardise it all and prove to you what you know so well already, that you are only a paltry liar in spite of your hypocritical pro testations of love, or whatever it is, for this little brown-faced puritan darling of yours.\" Her eyes were ablaze. She saw a deep flush overspread his face as he rose from the chair, but she misconstrued it. \" So I have moved you at last, have I ? I have seen through you and fathomed you and found you out. Take this from me, Lawrence Westerton"], [326, "308 LA WRENCE WESTERTON Galahad, I am desperate, and desperate women don't care for consequences.

I will come between you and your little white saint and poison your life, and hers too. Your unconcern is just superficial, no more ; I know it, I know it. And because of it I know that I can make you as much mine as ever you were, for my beauty can make you afraid. Now. I will use it ; tell her that from me.\" It was fortunate that they had the room to them selves, for in her fury she quite forgot to govern her voice. As for her threat he was not afraid of that, though she seemed determined to cause trouble in the future. It had raised a devil within him, how ever; he lost his self-control at last. He took up the challenge, the challenge all his chivalry had prompted him to refuse before. His indifference now should be no longer passively but actively demonstrated. He would show her that her beauty was as incapable of moving him as her threats of frightening him. He would shame her in her own eyes. Alas ! Lawrence. The devil was strong. He forgot her womanhood in the rush of the pent-up passion let loose at last, his own manhood, all \u2014 and he fell.

I will come to the theatre with you all to-night and to supper afterwards.\" It is easy to condemn him. He condemned himself bitterly in half an hour, but at the moment anger, and anger noble at bottom, blinded him. She saw she had gained her point. The con sciousness of that small triumph and the value of it quieted her passion at once. She raised her eye brows scornfully. She sneered : \" I hope you will prove better company, if you do, than you have been this afternoon. Come, this is all high-falutin absurdity. Take me out on to the balcony.\" There they found Miss Fotheringay and Archie watching the sun. \" Mr. Westerton's thought better of his refusal. He will come to-night,\" said Violet. Archie looked perplexed. Miss Fotheringay laughed outright. \" Give him a lift back, Archie,\" Violet added. \" He's going to try to make himself pleasant.\" \"Certainly,\" said Archie. \"Serious, Westerton?\" \" Yes,\" said Lawrence. \" And as you are going to give us supper you must dine with me \u2014 just a mouthful \u2014 quietly at ' The Balaclava.' \" Violet gave him a stately bow as if acknowledging"], [328, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 310 an attempt to conciliate her forgiveness. Archie assented, more perplexed than ever. There was a look on Lawrence's face he could not under stand. As they drove back together Lawrence grew thoughtful. He was beginning to recognise his meanness. They dropped him not far from his lodgings and he went in to dress. Could he draw back now ? All sorts of sophis tical arguments crowded into his brain bidding him go through with it. The lesson to Violet \u2014 the probable effect of this open display of careless indifference upon her future conduct \u2014 was it not better to prove to her by any means that she had no hold at all upon him now ? Would it not be better for her to know this at once and for all ? How could it affect himself? If he did not go now would not Violet have some grounds for believing him afraid of her really ? Would she not in con sequence become more troublesome ? Yes, but it was so mean. He had been betrayed by anger, irritated into determining upon doing a mean thing. Still he would not draw back for mere tenderness over his own conscience. It would save her trouble in the long run. His own moral degradation was comparatively unimportant. What happened to him was of no consequence. He knew he was un susceptible to Violet's fascinations. Nothing else mattered. Oh, Lawrence ! He resolved to go. David was most surprised by demand for dress clothes. They were buried. There had been no"], [329, "FALLEN AT LAST 311 requirement for so long. He ventured to ask what this unusual dissipation might be. \"Theatre for once in a way,\" Lawrence ex plained. \" I've been allowing myself to get too dull.\" There was apology in the explanation. \"Some stuff and nonsense at the Lyric.\" He laughed. David was puzzled. He remarked on his glad ness at his master's idea. Lawrence grunted, dressed and departed. He had not been gone a quarter of an hour, when David heard an alarming peal at the bell. He went down and found a broad-shouldered sun tanned gentleman in a black coat and white waistcoat, the tightness of which seemed at once to account for his apoplectic appearance, asking the housemaid whether Mr. Lawrence Westerton was in. David explained that he was not. \" Confound,\" gasped the apoplectic gentleman. \" Thought I should have found him at this time of day.\" A card-case burst from his waistcoat pocket. \" Tell him Mr. Trepinnock called and would be glad to see him to-morrow if he'll look in at Tadbrooke's in the evening or any time.\" And the card case struggled back as if it had been the thirteenth passenger getting into an omnibus. \"And,\" said Mr. Trepinnock, as if a brilliant thought had struck him, \" I suppose you couldn't tell me where he's gone to.\" \"The Lyric Theatre I think he said, sir,\" replied David. David's memory was usually more defective than he cared to admit. Pity that he"], [330, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 312 remembered this. But then Lawrence's expedition was so remarkable. \" Oh ! \" said Mr. Trepinnock. \" Ah ! \" said Mr. Trepinnock, and went out into the damp and darkness with a muffled \" thank you.\" He turned up Bond Street. Another brilliant thought struck him as he passed Satchell's Library. \" Why shouldn't girlie have a treat ? Dessay she'd like to meet him there.\" He went in and asked for two stalls. But there were no stalls to be had, only a box, the clerk informed him. Mr. Trepinnock hummed and ha'ed for a few seconds. A box was more private certainly for meeting friends in. \" May as well go the whole hog while I am about it.\" And he bought the box, and returned to Tadbrooke's with the title thereto, and a face beaming like a port light through the gloom."], [331, "CH APTER XX I ANOTHER MEETING Violet had prepared herself for conquest as well as she knew how ; which is saying a good deal.

She was magnificent, with a magnificence just subdued enough to escape vulgar assertiveness. There was no palpable impropriety in the display. That lay only in its suggestiveness. Her face was aglow.

His faith in himself was not for a moment shaken. His one revelation had been too overwhelmingly convincing to admit of doubt as to that. But he discovered one immediate source of discomfort. He realised that he could pity her no longer. He had not time to think what that meant, but it disturbed him. He could not pity her ; she aroused a feeling of antagonism now instead. Perhaps if there had been a sign of waning beauty, a trace of decay, of weakness, he might have been moved, dangerously affected towards her. But she was all too splendid, too grandly confident and condescending. He criticised, ad mired, and opposed her, satisfied of his own com plete indifference, rather contemptuous of his own pride in it than otherwise. He sat beside her at dinner. He listened to her conversation and marked the smiles and graces with which it was adorned, with ears and eyes bent upon artistic appreciation. He was studiously but coldly civil. She raged inwardly in conse quence. Outwardly she remained gracious and condescending. Confidence opposed to confidence. The opposition began to entertain her after a while.

I don't control the girl's actions. How could I bring her here ? Didn't you know she was in town then ? I saw the announcement in the paper.\" He glared. She had seen and not told him.

It never occurred to her, in her limited experience, that his apparent flippancy was sustained by the mere force of will which has enabled men to affect nonchalance on the scaffold. Such self-control would have been incomprehensible to her even if she had guessed it. It was only when Archie hinted at last that supper was over that his brow grew heavy again. But it cleared directly. His efforts had been spent in vain. The old evil had claimed him for its own. All that was left was to bow to the inevitable, bow and take the cup, wormwood though he knew it to be, drain it to the bottom, dash it down, and obliterate himself.

Full in his face it blew as they drove out straight into it, full in his face and the haggard mockery there. In his heart a hell of shame and sin and despair turned to wantonness, in his lungs the breath of Heaven from out the west, pure from the great sea, purer still for having blown over Dart moor. And there grew in the soul of Lawrence Wes terton a great wild passionate longing for freedom, to rise up even now, tear aside the web woven round his numbed enfeebled senses, to be a man, come life or death.

Evil had not won after all. When they reached her door he caught the paling with his hand and stood on the lowest step. She undid the latch and turned round for him to follow, but his hand gripped the paling a little tighter and he remained silent a moment. Then he lifted his head. A thrill of admiration, for she knew not what, passed through her to see him. \"Now God judge between us,\" he said, \"but I cannot, will not come in. I have wronged you and deceived you and tempted you into tempting as no one on earth should be capable of wronging and deceiving and tempting a woman. Call me a coward, think me a coward or what you will. I am not coward enough for this. Here I leave you. I will not move another step. Look into my eyes if you doubt my meaning.\" She looked into his eyes and saw unalterable passion of resolve. With a burst of fury she cursed him and slammed the door in his face. And that is all I have to say about Violet Vane. Yet I regret to leave her thus, in her fury. She was one of many, not so black as some paint them ; very human after all. I think, however, that in the coming years Lawrence will meet her again, to some effect.

Then he moved away and walked slowly back to his rooms. What a victory \u2014 this victory he had planned ! And as he neared them a lonely wandering woman met him as she walked profitlessly, com panionlessly, homewards. She stopped in his way and accosted him. He stopped too. \" Why make a hell for ourselves here ? \" he said. \" Is there not enough to come ? \" It was his gentle tone rather than the strangeness of the words that made her shrink away from him as if his face bore the affliction of the loathsome disease.

The cause of Doris' sudden alarm was a mystery to Mr. Trepinnock. His first idea was that the theatre was on fire, but a rapid glance round dis pelled that ; his next that she had been taken suddenly ill. Anyhow the sooner he got her home the better. He never saw Lawrence. He took her out at once and put her into a cab, and then tenderly inquired what was amiss. \" Please don't ask me, father,\" she murmured. \" I am all right again now. I am not ill at all, and I will tell you as soon as I am fit to think.\" Her hand stole into his. \" Now, don't ask me ; you won't, father, will you ? \" Mr. Trepinnock grunted acquiescence, and held her little hand in his own until they reached \" Tadbrooke's.\" And this was the meeting she had looked forward to and counted upon for nearly three months ! For ever since that day by the river's side, when she had come to the conclusion that where her love had been given there her duty lay also, she had grown ever more and more convinced that this"], [346, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 328 man's life had been committed into her hands to save and guide, ever more and more determined to keep him hers, ever more and more certain that he would prove himself worthy of her help and guid ance, even as he had already proved himself. He was her destiny. She willed it. Through the days in northern homes, among the hills and forests, whenever she had been alone, her thoughts had turned southwards, and she had pic tured the man working away in the breathless city, working and toiling to be worthy to have loved her as he had said, silent and comfortless, hopeless. And again she had pictured herself condescending to him, giving him at last the hope which should exalt him, make living blessed. Her love had gradually compacted in her soul a great holy faith in herself, in him, in the power of good to conquer and purify. When at last her father had turned homewards she had prayed for a day or two's pause in town that she might find him and see him and show him, how she knew not, that she valued his toil and could overlook past folly for its sake. It involved showing Mr. Trepinnock much. But he had foreborne to question her. He thought she had repented of that imagined rejection of Law rence. She seemed to want to see him to thank him for something. Perhaps her waywardness had led her into a mistake at Whitsuntide, which she would clear up. By all means they would see Lawrence. So she loved him after all. He liked that."], [347, "THE HAND TO THE FALLEN 329 To-day, therefore, she and her father had been to Mr. Phillips to find him \u2014 Mr. Wren's letter was with her always ; it supplied direction now \u2014 and had not found him indeed, but heard and known what it had made her heart beat fast with joy and pride and gratitude to hear. Mr. Trepinnock liked what he heard too. Then her father had sought for him at the address Mr. Phillips gave, and had returned with the theatre tickets and taken her to meet him. And five minutes at the theatre had undone all and given her a shock which would have mortally hurt a less high-minded girl. But her great faith saved her. There was an inconsistency between what she had heard and what she saw, an inconsistency which his look of terror had rendered the more horrible but partially explained, and which that faith had recognised at once. Even if there were no explanation, that could not alter her destiny now. Even if there were no explanation of this, yet it was for her he had worked, and through his work gained a claim upon her. How was that to be acknowledged ? Was it to be ignored ? Did it not cry for mercy for him, though he never came to crave mercy for him self? And he could not come himself. Yet if he came not himself what could she dare to do ? How could she face this destiny ? By the sacred ring on her finger, by Arthur's, her own brother's fate, what could she do ? But there must be explanation. She would not believe there was none."], [348, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 330 She went straight up to her room in the hotel and fell on her knees to pray for guidance. Here was evil risen up again to fight ; no indifference was possible any more. God help her to fight it in the right way and keep her stainless the while ; that was all she prayed for. She never doubted as to where her duty lay now. She was not one to flee for fear of contamination. She was ready to pass through the breath of it. Purity gave her no right to hold aloof from the battle. It was armour, not a warrant against the obligation to fight. Grief! not a moment allowed for that. Her whole strength, undoubting, undaunted, must go forth into the field. That it might be guided aright to do all that a woman might dare her only prayer. Her path grew clear. She rose from her knees. As she was she wrote him a letter, and sent it by the messenger to his address that night. It was this letter which Lawrence found on his table. The writing told him it was not a bill. For a moment he thought upon the incongruity of opening a bill to-night. This was how it ran : \u2014 \" Sir, \u2014 My father and I called on Mr. Hartley Phillips to-day to enquire for you, and heard what it gave me more pleasure to hear than I can now admit.

The thought of that supreme horror, even now that he had escaped the actuality, was more than flesh could bear. The perspiration trickled down his face and on to the letter trembling in his hand. By the favour of Heaven the south-west wind had blown that night, by the favour of Heaven he had not been tempted past enduring, by the favour of Heaven he was still just fit to creep at her order to her feet. He stooped to kiss the letter. As he stooped the strung chord snapped. He reeled and fell heavily forwards against the table. It caught his arms, and there he remained with his knees bent under him, and his cheek crushed against the crumpled blotted paper, huddled into a senseless heap.

But he was too feeble to do more than prop him against his own knees. And the fear came into his heart and the tears to his eyes as he chafed his master's numbed and icy hands. Poor old man, who had a greater sight than he ? He read the letter lying there all through. He could not understand it, but it seemed kind. It must be kind, for as soon as Lawrence regained consciousness his eyes wandered round wildly and his hands clutched it up. \" David, David,\" and he awoke fully. \" David, what is it ? \" The old man's self-possession came back.

David,\" he held up the letter, \" this is reprieve.\" He guided himself to the window by the furni ture and leaned out. It was nearly seven and the October sun was just rising through the broken clouds. \" Pure ! Even here,\" he murmured. Then he dropped into a chair by the window, and to gratify David drank a little coffee. But it almost made him sick. Nothing David could say could induce him to go to bed. He consented to have a rug or two thrown over him as he sat, that was all. David hovered about uncertain what to do, half inclined to send for a doctor at once. \" Now, David,\" Lawrence said at last, \" don't stand there, man. I'm all right now. Leave me alone, for God's sake ; leave me alone, I want to think.\" The old man's eyes grew moist with re proach. Lawrence stretched out a hand to him. \" Dear old David, I'm a damned ungrateful beggar.

He read it and pondered over the meaning of every word."], [353, "THE HAND TO THE FALLEN 335 So they had been to see Mr. Phillips yesterday, and if he had not gone for that walk in Richmond Park he would have met them ! And if they had not gone to see Mr. Phillips ! Would her faith have been strong enough to resist the conclusion forced upon her at the Theatre ? Oh, if she had learnt nothing beforehand ! And the lie she spoke of! The lie his despair had so nearly given to the words he had uttered at their last meeting ! And because he had kept his word as to the one thing she could refuse to believe but that he had kept it in all \u2014 until his own lips condemned him. Wondrous, noble, power of belies of woman ! And because he had kept his word as to that one thing he had given her this strange right she could claim in spite of every appearance against him. Right ! Right ! He dared hardly think of it. Explanation too. How could he ever explain in words fit for her to hear ? Must he care for nothing, so that she might understand? He racked his tired brain. He could not tell. Nothing should be hidden from her. That was settled. When the time came she should know the whole story. Best leave the words to shape themselves then. He fell to pondering over this maidenly power which could dare to deal with such matters, and for him ; and knew not whether to be proud or overcome with humiliation that in her seemingly lay all the strength, and in himself none. What this meeting might bring to him or what conditions she might impose upon him to enforce"], [354, "336 LAWRENCE WESTERTON the right she could condescend to claim over his life he had no strength left to consider.

All that was possible for him was to acknowledge and obey, trusting that from her might proceed together with command a strength to render his obedience of some avail. At last and with a mighty force the conviction had stormed in upon him that as his own wisdom had been mere folly and weariness, so now his own strength had proved feebleness and vanity, and that but for her Lawrence Westerton had sunk into the darkness of the deep, never to rise again. Hour after hour he sat by the window and pon dered and wondered in a dull dreamy way, every now and then struggling ineffectually to realise the fulness of the fact that this was part of a real life and no delusive imagination of a sick wandering brain. And as the afternoon drew on a nervous dread stole upon him for the meeting which would settle once for all the meaning of his life, stole upon him and mixed itself into his dreams with the creeping chill of November mists, until he could bear it no longer, but started up and paced the room backwards and forwards, shivering with cold and fear.

Was she so strong and powerful as to render his acceptance of her help and guidance permissible for him ? For"], [355, "THE HAND TO THE FALLEN 337 it involved nothing less than herself. Till now his faith had been too overwhelming to admit of serious doubts. It was all the religion he had now. Was it false or true ? Was it even reasonable ? She was but a woman after all, and, since woman, sus ceptible to pollution, and by him. Would his acceptance be the most humbly noble act of his life or the most arrogantly base ? His faith could answer alone. If he could believe her strong enough to raise him he might take all ; if not \u2014 oh ! the crowning infamy of the ruin to come after. Even as his weary head throbbed and struggled to form the right, the true, and unselfish conclusion that faith rose again to dispel the doubt, to remind him of what it had done for him these five months past, to encourage him, to call for recognition despite himself, until he almost felt as if the devil had taken it for a weapon to use for his final defeat. Would his acceptance make him hers, or by it would she but become his so that he might know the perfect reali sation of true pure beauty of soul but to spoil and taint and destroy it ? Faith ! But brain, intellect besides, what was left of them ! Which to trust ? If he refused the risk, what then ? He could yet serve her, live for her every day of his life. And again faith clamoured : what risk ? Was not the very acknowledgment of a risk such a con fession as would lead to yet graver doubts hereafter?

When he had wound it the winding struck him as involuntarily symbolical. Why had he not let it run down, cease to work, be nothing but a frame of discarded ma chinery, useless lumber ? Why not ?

A boy was sent to lead him upstairs, and Lawrence pulled himself up by the banisters. But when they reached the landing he was panting as if he had run a mile, and a loath some feeling of sickness seized him again as they knocked at the door. He squeezed up her letter in his hand, paused for another supplication, and went in. Oh ! the strange relief to find that she was not alone. There beside her sat a little dumpy middle aged man with a teacup in his hand, and a face all bristles and benevolence. She bowed slightly to Lawrence without rising, and pointed to a seat. He almost fell into it.

The situation was evidently more than he felt equal to single handed. \" Why, bless me, it's past four already. I hope I shan't miss seeing your father,\" turning to Doris with a look of entreaty for help to keep up something like a conversation sufficient to cover a retreat without confessed disaster. Was he going to wait until the Squire came in ? Lawrence almost hoped that he was and at the same time consigned him to the bottommost pit. \" My father will not be in, I'm afraid, before five,\" said Doris. \"Well perhaps I'll look in to-morrow. No; may I ask you to tell him I shall be at the club till seven ? And if he can manage to look me up there that'll be the best.\" He ascended from his chair with an awkwardness he could not conceal, shook hands with Doris, gave Lawrence a stiff"], [359, "REVELATION 341 square bow with an inflexion of warning in it, and was gone. Doris rose and stood by the mantelpiece. She was very pale, but she stood there calmly as she had stood that night on the grass. Lawrence rose too. She began in a voice low, but clear and firm. \" Mr. Westerton, you have kept that promise you gave me months ago.\" \" Faithfully,\" he added quietly, and his eyes travelled over the pattern of the carpet till they rested at her feet. Then as she remained silent he ventured to raise them and found her own fixed upon him in serene expectation. The passion broke forth : \" Oh ! Doris, Doris,\" he cried and stretched out his hands with an involuntary movement towards her. With a flash of anger she drew back and caught at her dress. Nature was too strong. \" How dare you, sir ? Sit down. You are not fit to touch me.\" He cowered down on to his chair. His lips writhed over his teeth. \" I know it, I know it,\" in a fierce monotone. \" And you know that I know it or you would not have ordered me here.

Suddenly she threw her arms round him and dragged him down into a chair. She knelt beside him. \" O father, how much must I tell you ? \" \" Childie, just as much or just as little as you like. I'll be satisfied with anything.\" \"Then, I love him, father. Is that enough?\" The Squire kissed her head. \" Enough for the present,\" he said."], [367, "CHAPTER XXIV LOOKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS. May come again. Lawrence sat on a seat in the park with a letter in his hand: and looked backward and forward. He had come out early to sit in the sun for an hour before breakfast and his day's work. Out of the cloudless blue, untainted at this hour, the May sun beamed down upon the gladness of Spring bursting green and vivid through London grime, down upon the chestnuts that hurry to dress and the elms and the tardy planes, upon the grass in its humbler joy and the paths newly spread with cockle-shells for the delight of baby treasure-seekers. Cleaner and gladder for May the park glowed back up to the morning ; the whispering boughs sighed its praises ; the sparrows and starlings chir ruped and chanted them. And Lawrence too was glad, triumphantly glad ; but very solemn in his gladness. He looked glad and tired, as men look when they are happy over the work that they have done. He had toiled through the six months past unrestingly. It was not vanity that said he had accomplished"], [368, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 350 somewhat, nor arrogance that told him he might claim the guerdon now, but the spirit of life singing praises. To-morrow he would be on Dartmoor. He wanted an hour's calm thought over that in the early morning. Out here in the park he would be able to think better, more definitely, of the meaning of work and reward, and of purity. And lo ! he could only sit here and glow in gratitude for sun and fresh air, taking all meanings, all ex pectations, for granted ; sit and glow upon his letter. \" Let him ask no other blessedness : \" the old proverb, how often it had come back to him through those six months ! With what a difference ! He had asked for the blessedness of work, and it had been given by a hand that made its blessedness doubly divine. Worthy of that blessedness he had striven to become and to be content, asking nothing more. What was this contrariness of Dispensation that had forthwith disclosed to him the truth of that other proverb in its bounty : \" unto him that hath : \" a proverb whose truth he had formerly but recog nised in its bereaving : \" unto him that hath not ? \" What was there in active struggle to work and be content that could so command all other blessings ? He could almost question the justice of this great bounty in the midst of his gladness and gratitude. He wished to be more than glad and grateful, to comprehend. But the endeavour to be more but set a jumbled picture of these last six months before him, and he sat wondering."], [369, "LOOKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS 351 He recalled the first shock of his joy, his in ability for days afterwards to do aught but sit wondering there, struggling feebly and vainly to feel it real, his very own, dreaming yet sensible of dreaming ; as is said of men who wake from the unconsciousness of some body-shattering blow and loss of blood but to know that they are at peace and wish to sleep again. Days of gazing through an open window set toward the west, days of kneeling and silence with clenched hands, days of wild native worship, grown misty, almost unbeliev able now that time had brought the fuller light of sober reason ; yet days of ecstacy in weakness sacred for ever. He recalled a journey north-westward, the song of the jolting train, the freshness of sea-breezes, the walks with a stick and then without a stick ; he recalled the waking from half consciousness, the mountain height where he had stood alone the first day of winter, and suddenly become man again, man breathing hard with climbing and physical comfort, healthy and strong, ready for work, rein vigorated with the keen pure air that blew o'er the heights looking down upon the vale of Ogwen and David's home in slaty Bethesda. It was at David's suggestion that he had chosen Wales and climbing. How he had blessed the dear old man for his fatherly care and guidance in the feebleness of that fortnight of recovery among the quarry men ! And the descent from Carnedd Llewellyn ! Strid ing back down, down among men, back to serve and"], [370, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 352 worship and love in their midst this sweet girl saviour, who had claimed his life for herself. That evening David had greeted his return almost with tears: \" Yourself you're lookin', Master Lawrence, and thank God,\" and he had murmured an amen which had choked him. A day or two for assurance of strength, then back to the fog that could never be fog again, and the winter that had no chill. The evening-classes, the club-room, and endless bagatelle with the boys, the arithmetic and writing lessons, beyond which he never ventured, in the schools, Mr. Phillips' silent gratitude, the steadily growing knowledge of a value, the knowledge of the pressure, the struggle, and the heroisms of poverty, the greeting of child friends, their confidences over child troubles, their strangely expressed affection, their wild delight over those Christmas dinners and Christmas entertainments, the holly, the smell of countless oranges, the hot odour of pudding and cake, the sound of crackers ; all came back to him, sitting there in the park. At Christmas too he had mustered up courage to send a token, and had received one in exchange. All the letters of thanks he had won he had sent on to her with a disclaimer of his own title to them. In return he had received a little silver ring with the word fide engraved upon the inside. Then on again through the new year, through the dawdling months that were still all too short for effect, that were nevertheless not without effect ; through weariness and happiness in weariness,"], [371, "LOOKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS 353 regretting but that flesh could only bear so much a day ; the guiding vision always before him, certain, never a moment hidden ; not behind but before him. These six months ! O Doris! There was a light in his face, the light of a faith confirmed, of a good realised in fulfilment of purpose, of understanding, of wonder and worship, of joy deep-rooted, come of knowledge and experience, set firm and fast, unfading. His very attitude as he sat on the seat with his legs crossed and one arm flung along its back was expressive of confidence as of old, but now of a quieter graver order, no mere self-assertion. He looked large and the stronger for discipline. To-morrow on Dartmoor ! Every now and again he repeated that to himself and read the four words that made the letter in his hand. Next Sunday was Whitsunday. A few days ago he had spent the morning in framing the request to her, the request for permission to come at last. Yesterday he had got his answer in the four words : \"I am expecting you.\" At last. He had not a shadow of doubt. He might ask for all now. He was going to ask for all. And he knew that whatever he asked would be granted him. He knew the true humility from its counterfeit, and the promptings of each, the difference between penitence and remorse, between noble and ignoble shame. Had he not had a year's learning how to love ? A year's learning, was a year enough? Enough"], [372, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 354 for a beginning ; and there was the rest of his life to be spent in learning and nothing but learning. O Doris ! He thought of the power of women and their price ; of their exaction, and man's inability to refuse the last farthing demanded ; of the nobility of payment, the necessity for payment of the last farthing demanded ; of the immensity of his own debt, of his purpose to pay to the last farthing ; of that strange release in \" owing and yet owing not, but still paying, at once indebted and discharged.\" For all his thoughts were blurred by joy in the debt. It was magnificent to be loved ; to have been loved, to have been waited for, to be honoured and trusted in spite of fall. To be beginning to feel he might some day earn a fraction of the price, it was exaltation. To be dependent, to be guided, to have found the complement, it was perfection. O Doris ! \" I love you, by God, I believe I love you in the way you ought to be loved ; though never enough.\" He caught up a handful of shells ; he clenched them into shivers, and threw the dust into the air with a laugh. \"And you are as fragile as one of the slightest of those, but to crush you so I am as impotent as the Atlantic roller. \" You are firm and strong as the rocks that force it into the haven channel, into the mould of the tiniest rift of their own granite fissures ; you are tender and soft as the yielding sand, one with them, in its beds below."], [373, "LOOKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS 355 \" You are heavy as the ounce at the end of the sage's lever-beam, light as the poised plumage of the never-tiring albatross ; as little as that straw to a drowning man, as great as the ark with its three hundred cubits ; and no ocean mail's hawser can hold like a single thread of your wafted hair, no battering ram stir the gate that falls at the tick of your little finger's nail. \"You lead, you point, you lighten the way ; you are will, and revelation ; and breath of sunrise, and peace of sunset, and glow of noon. You are water for cleansing and wine for enthusiasm. You are wise with the nineteen centuries, though you know no language but this English and cannot multiply by thirteen in your head ; the head that can count every trouble within a day's walk of your home, and how far beyond God knows. \" You are gaoler and queen, to chain and rule. But your fetters are the freedom of man and your sceptre his salvation. \" And I love you the more because you are all this so easily that you enable me to believe there must be thousands and thousands not a whit less than you. \"Love \u2014 to bid me picture life without you now would be to bid the artist, as he worships the grandest, truest, picture in the world, to scrape the canvas of it into blankness and tatters and nothing with a knife. Love \u2014 and that were nothing to this. \" All this is to be mine. And I sit here sane to know it.\""], [374, "CHAPTER XXV REWARD The people at the \" Three Foxes \" were exuberant in their welcome. They had the air of persons awaiting the unfolding of secrets. Their eyes twinkled with intelligence and ill-concealed curi osity as they gave him a note, left for him that \" very afternoon by Miss Doris herself ; \" who \" seemed in wonderful good spirits,\" they hastened to add. \" To-morrow at three by the pool where the wall comes down to the river and a bar is missing from the fence.\" Lawrence blushed like a school-boy as he read, beneath their sympathetic scrutiny. Then to satisfy their expectations (and himself) he kissed the letter before them boldly. Mrs. Baker smoothed her apron smiling. \" Don't see no fishing-rod this time, sir,\" said Joe as if he had assisted at the unlading of Lawrence's luggage. He wished to set Lawrence at ease by making conversation and at the same time displaying his own sagacity. Then to make"], [375, "REWARD 357 the same unmistakable he added : \" Come on a different errand this year, sir?\" Mrs. Baker's femi nine tact thereupon recommended bustle. There was bustle accordingly. He stood on the bridge that evening just as he did last year. He leant on the same stones and breathed the same air and felt the same sense of peace. Had a year passed over the moor ? It lay silent, majestic, unchanged, unchangeable as ever. His own change grew too great for reckoning by contrast. Changed but not estranged, nay very close. Welcome was breathed in the scent of these pines ; he belonged to this heather-clad earth. It seemed ready to embrace him. Here was home. He spread out his hands around towards the hills, blessing them for their peaceful constancy and the stream for its ceaseless cool monotone of praise. And the beauty of the morning came like nature's sanction to his love with smiles and kisses from the south in sun and showers. He went out early up to the pool and waited. He lay on his back in the heather and fed his eyes on the dappled blue. He turned on his side and fed them on the painted earth. He watched the trout jump and the whirl of insects and the scattered sheep beyond. He lay prone and fingered the knotty roots of the growth in the sand. He rose and walked a quarter of a mile up stream, and came back to lie down again. He sat up and tried to draw \u2014 faces nothing but faces, and tore the paper"], [376, "358 LAWRENCE WESTERTON across. He ate a lump of cake from his pocket and tried to feel ordinary ; but that was a worse failure still. He planned speeches to her, the oratorical, the passionate, the simple matter of fact ; but all were equally and hopelessly inadequate. He gave that up too. He went on simply waiting without attempting to cheat time. He looked at his watch fifty times or more before it was twelve o'clock. Three more hours to wait ! No not three more minutes. What a deal you have yet to learn, Lawrence ! Are you the only one likely to come too early ? Your back is turned toward the hill. You are not aware of a dancing patch of white, the figure of Doris descending \u2014 three hours too soon, to sit and wait too. She too has brought out her lunch so that she may sit and wait for you ; and now she will not have the plea sure of waiting. He heard the rustle of her print through the heather from afar. But some music fetters like frost. She was within ten yards of him by the time he was on his feet, with the blood thrumming in his head and a face like a dazzled dreamer's in waking. With a broken \" Oh ! \" he started towards her, but she put up the palm of her hand to his mouth for greeting and silence, and motioned him down to the heather. She sat before him and looked at him for a while sedately ; and the crimson was all in his own face."], [377, "REWARD 359 Then suddenly she rose to her knees ; she put up her hands against his cheeks, and kissed him on the forehead. \" Now tell it me all,\" she said, and sank back from him with a sigh of content. He began at the middle, muffled almost inaudible, then at the end, and in the future; and then because nothing was independent of order of date except his everlasting love he had to begin all over again right from the beginning. But mere chronology was impossible. He gasped for the help of questions, and they came readily. He told her of friendships with children ; of friendships, more difficult, with mothers and fathers ; of the school and his club and the cricket lately restarted; of the winter evenings and games; of the law books and newspaper reports ; of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ; of public houses; of drunkards and worse than drunkards; of press cuttings stuck in a book, record of misery ; of meanness and cruelty and evasion; of ejectment and resistance; of tenements; of broken flower-pots and draggled clothes ; of rain and snow and slush and fog and darkness ; of poor man's law, so much as he knew; of the difficulty of merciful application and the cry against every endeavour to improve without largesse ; of patience and pity and confusion ; of anger; of pawn-shops and degradation and light heartedness and living from hand to mouth ; of pro fusion in prosperity ; of extravagance ; of the worry ing along through good and bad ; of disease and endurance ; of delight over so little ; of delight in"], [378, "360 LAWRENCE WESTERTON pictures, in flowers, in organ tunes, in any slightest alleviation, unthinking, uncalculating. \" It is all a desperate muddle,\" he said at last, growing apologetic for his own incoherence. \"One never seems to get a real broad grasp of the facts. I have a bewildering habit of seeing two sides to everything or rather fifty different sides, and not a single one clearly. 'Pon my word I sometimes think it would be much better never to see more than one. And you can't move a step without treading on someone's precious toes, or damaging someone's glorious rights and liberties and inter ests, or relieving somebody of plain and obvious duties, that they're only too glad to shuffle out of, even if they've ever recognised them ; which isn't often the case. And what the dickens charity does consist in I'm sure I don't know. I'm not sure that looking after other people's children is real charity. And when one goes beyond the children it's ten times worse.\" She was smiling gravely. \" Just take one instance,\" he said. \" Perhaps you have heard of the dinners at the docks that some good folk have started, honest cheap dinners for an honest sum. Well that seemed to me a real downright good thing until some thinking fiend called attention to the fact that it was not true charity after all or some such stuff, because its ultimate effect would be to lower the price at which a man could work and by consequence his wages eventually.\" \" But even if his wages were lowered he would"], [379, "REWARD 361 get a good dinner cheaply instead of a doubtful one for more perhaps,\" she put in. \" I heard two stable-men discussing money the other day,\" he said. \" One said quite seriously that nothing on earth that cannot be had for money is worth having. If you deny it you're only re garded as a sentimental idiot a century or two after your time. Every one says the same, or rather doesn't say it so much as acts upon it, from the political economists downwards \u2014 or upwards. To be a political economist before all things it is necessary to be a pessimist. That's so. If you're a pessimist you're a hard-brained go-ahead, and ' get on in life ' ; if you're an optimist you're a colloquial equivalent for fulsome fool, and don't. It's averagely sickening. But I haven't gone into the questions. I've done very little interfering. I have tried to learn, and I've just stuck to the children and only interested myself in them in a practical way. That was following your directions. They were quite clear, clear as your cloudless eyes.\" He pulled up with a jerk. The truth of that comparison required a moment's fixed confirmation. \" They were not my directions,\" she said. \"They are a little older than I am.\" \"But now,\" he said, \"beyond the children. What is beyond the children ? How to set about it ? What to appeal to ? How to keep them from thinking only of money in the midst of this struggle for life, which forces their attention on that and nothing else, and apparently means to go on forcing"], [380, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 362 it. I have bought influence, to put it in the ver nacular ; these people are beginning to look to me for something more than money. And I have nothing else to give them. I have tried to make them want to live in the country by making them dissatisfied with town \u2014 rather equivocal advice, of an unac ceptable kind. Then I have tried to impress upon them the fact, which they look upon as one of those pulpit fancies so blessed to hear and so im possible to practise, that hostility is not the neces sary or only possible relation between employer and employed, nor pecuniary advantage the one thing to be gained. They ask me if I am a lawyer and snigger out the vulgar jokes about sharks, &c. Of course I quarrel with them, which doesn't advance matters. Still my endeavours may stir them a trifle in time. I have striven to be just \u2014 and faithful. But, good Lord, how I wish one could see a bit oneself. Political economy doesn't seem to recognise mere giving as anything but ridiculously and contemptibly unscientific.\" \" But for all that,\" she said, \" we aren't and never shall be machines to be worked by calcula tion of cogs and levers. We are not a mathematical puzzle to be fitted together by brains. There's need for brains enough but for a good deal more beside. And giving is disparaged nowadays, because I suppose the only giving we can attribute to the rich is that of giving recklessly, to save themselves trouble. But there is giving to be done and will be until they screw a ' not ' into that gentle com mand : ' Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and"], [381, "REWARD 363 visit the children and fatherless in their affliction.' We can't be all great economists or Chancellors of Exchequers. We must be content with simpler rules if we're not to waste time as well as every thing else.\" \" O Doris, you are so certain. Nothing is certain, nobody is certain but you.\" He clutched the edge of her skirt. \" Teach me, Doris ; teach me everything.\" \" But I am just a girl. What makes you so sure I am right ? \" \" Doris, suppose a blind man lost his way and fell into a ditch at the cross-roads, and suppose the littlest child came and pulled him out. And suppose that littlest child not only pulled him out but put its hands to his eyes and took his blindness suddenly away. And then suppose the child pointed along one of those cross-roads. Can you suppose for a moment the man would pause to speculate on the littleness of the child and its pos sible ignorance of the country ? If all the sophistry of the world came along and scoffed at the child and the man together I do not think the man would do more than spit upon it, and turn along that road pointed out. I am just that man.\" \" But what happens to the child ? \" \" Doris, will you come along the road with him ? \" His face was white, not with doubt, but passion. She stretched out her right hand towards him. He took it on the flat of both his own. He gazed upon it resting there."], [382, "LAWRENCE WESTERTON 364 \" What a miracle ! \" he said. \" Even now, looking away from your eyes for one moment, I hardly dare.\" \"You may dare.' So he dared. \" I wish I was the greatest poet that ever lived, Shakespeare with his 15,000 words, to use them all to show you how utterly happy I am.\" \" There is more than words written in your face, Lawrence, for me to read.\" A silence. Presently she said : \" For just one moment long ago I thought of throwing that ring away. It was my brother gave it me. It has a meaning ; can you guess it ? \" He twirled the sapphires round her finger. \" It is blue all round,\" he answered. \" Your riddle is not hard to guess, nor the answer hard to believe, for me. Your forefinger \u2014 index.\" Another silence. At last he asked : \"And you, Doris, what have you done all winter ? Have you fished or hunted much ? \" \" What have I done all winter ? Very little. I have \u2014 oh ! don't ask me. Yes, I have fished a little but I have not hunted. That would not have been fair.\" He looked puzzled a moment, then he said : \" Fair, fair, Doris ! you thought of the risk for my sake. You make me very humble.\" \"No, proud, Lawrence; you should be proud.\" He stuttered and stammered out the inevitable"], [383, "REWARD 365 question: \"Doris, what made you ever think of loving me ? \" There came that old glance of fierceness into her eyes : \" Because you could trust me even while you hurt me.\" \"Who could help trusting you, Doris? You never seem to distrust yourself.\" \"And then, you know,\" she added, \"you carried me up Merridown.\" The blush came at last and crinisoned her face. She looked over her shoulder up the hill behind. \" It is getting late,\" she said. \" The sun of my day is but just risen. I am ready to go afield, so you will buckle the armour.\" \"No, I will button the fustian.\" \" It is the same thing.\" \" That is for you to prove.\" He was on his feet before her to help her rise. He did not see the swell of her stretched neck, nor the ball of her upturned chin, nor even the slant of her eyelids. He saw but the bunched lips that rose towards him. And seeing them Lawrence Westerton forgot. But after all the name of my story is a misnomer, for the making of Lawrence Westerton has only just begun. Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & Co.
