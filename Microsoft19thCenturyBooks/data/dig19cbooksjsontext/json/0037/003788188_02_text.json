Yet you are so suited ! there will be fortune, and no earthly objection.\" \" One strong one,\" returned Ellen, \" which is, that I have a harder heart than you think ! It is not with girlish folly and affectation I speak, but with a far more serious and earnest meaning, when I disclaim any idea of matrimony at present : I assure you, my heart is as hard in that way as the nether mill stone.\" \"You have been plagued and worried enough, Ellen, to account for your present feelings ; neverthe less,, though I give you credit for sincerity, you must allow me the pleasure of hope; so I shall go on building my little castle very happily and innocently.\" \" I think I have seen enough ; that my own ex perience of marriage is rather a preserver against my having any visions of that kind,\" continued Ellen, gravely. \" In our family it has hitherto been"], [11, "THE ABBEY. 3 a bitter cup in the draining, and I must get you now to tell me everything. You would not last time, but I feel now that I am old and reasonable enough to hear all you can tell me.\" \" Well, my dear, I will think about it ! It is a painful task, for it partly affects the living, as well as the dead.\" \" My father ! But, Worthy, you well know how I guessed it long ago. I am unlike poor Bessie ; I always had a keen eye for all the faults of others. I know he never loved my mother. Yet, do you know, I could have loved him ! Yes, I am sure I should have loved my father \u2014 but for that woman. It is my nature to love those most of whom I have a little dash of fear, and there was always something attractive in my father's handsome person and proud reserved bearing : \u2014 a mystery in the dim silent study from which we were excluded \u2014 an awe in his strictly polite and finished manners, and his sometimes evident pride in his children. He loved Bessie best, but I knew \u2014 I felt he was proud of me. I have often felt his eye fixed on me, and heard him sigh ; and once or twice, when he was thrown off his guard, he has betrayed emotion of no common kind even when angry and irritated against me.\" \" I dare say !

There is no time ; for see ! here we are. There is nothing very pleasant in some of the recollections of my youth. I have seen strange things : I have individually passed many quiet happy years since that time, though my friends are gone ; but here is old Jeffrey himself,\" and Mrs. Wentworth was evidently glad to turn from the subject. The Abbey, i. e., the original building, stood on the crest of a thickly wooded hill, commanding a view of the sea and the long straggling village of Ashbv Cross, with endless moors stretching out far in the distance, their grey tints contrasting well with the rich woods, the fields, and the extensive pleasure grounds. A stream ran below this hill, famous for its trout, and well known to many an angler, who loved to follow its windings round the picturesque woods by day, and return at night to the clean little Abbey inn, which stood at the end of the village, and listen to all the legends of the place ; of which the landlord had enough and to spare. The more modern building, usually called the Abbey House, stood more in the valley, facing the wooded hill and the grey ruins. Part of it had been pulled down by the Roundheads, and rebuilt, after the lapse of many years, in a dif ferent style ; but Mrs. Wentworth could tell of the thick walls with chambers in them, so mysterious and"], [13, "5 THE ABBEY. awful to her as a girl, where fugitive royalists were said to have been secreted by Bertha, the good lady of the Raymond family. The house had been burnt down since then ; and as Mrs. Wentworth drove up the' once stately avenue, they both exclaimed at the dreary look of the shattered blackened walls and heaps of brick and mortar, while roses threw out great thorny branches across the paths, as if to guard it like the enchanted palace of fairy tales. All was ruin and confusion \u2014 except the once mossy lawn, which had been freshly ploughed by Farmer Lewis. The ladies alighted and went to the flight of broad stone steps, which still remained, from whence there w-as a beautiful view. Broken ginger-beer bottles and corks, and a heap of cinders near a large flat stone, spoke of last summer's picnics. It was indeed a favourite resort to strangers. Ellen sickened as she saw this, and turned away hastily. A rude hedge of roses, now broken down in some places, separated them from what had been a flower garden. Ellen went there, and was followed by her companion. \" Yes,\" she said, \" this was their garden. Their private sitting room led out by a flight of steps to this, and it used to be quite shut out from the front. Hours and hours have I passed here gardening, and singing, or reading under that large tree.\" Mrs. Wentworth said she seldom came here now \u2014 it was too melancholy; and after getting her rose plants was evidently glad to hurry away."], [14, "6 UPS AND DOWNS. Not so Ellen. She would like to have spent hours in roving about, and dreaming over the past. It grated harshly on her pride to feel how much the fortunes of her family had sunk. A Raymond married to an apothecary, in a dismal country town I her father under the dominion of a low bred woman ! herself without a home, and as poor as she was proud. But the more she looked at the desolate wreck of her mother's home, or the time-honoured ruins which stood out so boldly against the soft light of the sky ; the higher she raised herself, dreams of what she would do, passed rapidly before her. Her brother was dead: had never survived his babyhood; but why should not a woman do something to reclaim the tarnished honour of the family ? Where there was a will, there was always a way ; and so on. \" Ellen, my love,\" said Mrs. Wentworth, that evenin_\\ _-atherin_- together her delicate knitting, which so well showed off the taper and graceful fingers. \" Our visit to the poor old place has not inspirited us, I think : or perhaps you are tired with your walk this morning ? \" \" No.\" Ellen said she was not tired \u2014 only dull, and perhaps a little miserable. Yes, \" miserable ; * it was no use denying or hiding it. At Blair, at least, she need not wear a mask. It was such a comfort to be true. \" But I should hope that the very being at Blair"], [15, "THE ABBEY. 7 may enable the true face to be a happy one. It would be hard indeed if Poole troubles reached you here. Come shake it off, Ellen ; forget it all, my love.\" \"Forget! Ah, so I thought I should; but, Worthy, it is not easy.\" \" Poor soul ! But now you are well out of it, Ellen. If your father will marry that woman \u2014 well, it can't be helped.\" \" I was not thinking of that. But it isn't pleasant to have such bitter, bitter things said and believed of one. They say such dreadful, such cruel things of me. You know, Worthy, that it was while I was staying at Mrs. Ullathorne's that Bessie's engage ment and marriage took place, all in a great hurry. How I hated it ! But I could not prevent it ; and my opposition was attributed by Mrs. Hay to my jealousy and envy of Bessie's good fortune \u2014 that I did not like her to be married first.\" Ellen's lips curled with proud disdain as she said this. \" Bessie cried, and was wretched. When I found how fond she was of John, I determined to say no more. I have borne a good deal : but never mind, if she is but happy. No wonder, if hi all this 'row' I was glad to turn to poor Alick's pleasant face, and talk and laugh with him. I must confess also, there was some little pleasure in braving his mother. It was enough to harden me, or any one, to have such looks, such eyes, cast on me, and to hear"], [16, "8 UPS AND DOWNS. such dreadful stories. It is a wonder I have any love left for poor Bess, they have tried so hard to set her against me.\" \" Do you believe her to be happy ? \" asked Mrs, Wentworth. \" Indeed, I can't say : I fear much that her eyes are opening. She must feel the selfishness and the coarseness of his character. He should have had a regular spirit \u2014 a determined woman, like his own sister. Bess is too meek and gentle; and I must say her slow, dawdling ways are enough to provoke a man, at times. But she is so devoted, and so good. It is hateful to see him flirting with every girl he sees, and leaving her to pine and faint at all the home trials alone. He is losing his practice, and is, I believe, in some difficulty. The worst time was when he found that the expected fortune from Mrs. Ullathorne had dwindled into a mourning brooch and 10?. a year. Mrs. Hay had no authority, no right, to proclaim Bessie as her godmother's heiress ; but I am very sure the marriage was made up by her on the strength of it. Mrs. Ullathorne was a severe tempered, narrow-minded, old woman. She used to cross-examine me about John and Bessie. I always, of course, spoke of Bessie as I thought and felt, but when she would take no evasion, and asked me plump if I liked John, what could I say ? I hesi tated, and tried my best ; but though I expressed a hope that marriage would improve him, and tried to"], [17, "THE ABBEY. 9 bring out his good points (oh, it was hard work, the digging for them I assure you!) she would nail me to the direct question, \" Did I think highly of him ? \" I said ' No ; ' and there it ended. But they choose to lay her will, to my \u2014 my \u2014 management. Yes,\" she added, speaking rapidly, and with glow- ing cheeks, \" I am accused, Worthy, of flattering her, trying to ingratiate myself, and speaking ill of my sister, because \u2014 because \u2014 oh, it makes me so angry! \u2014 because I was to marry Mr. Vaughan, they said. He was a distant relative of Mrs. Ullathorne's, and staying with her while I was there. He had just come in for some money, and changed his name, and it was to him the old lady left every- thing.\" 'S' \"Vaughan! Vaughan! do you know him? Edward Vaughan ? \" exclaimed Mrs. Wentworth, with ani mated eagerness, in every look and gesture. \" Yes ; I knew him then, and \u2014 and I had met him once before, under another name, under curious cir cumstances, which rather served to bring us together ; and he is peculiar in his manner to ladies.

Mrs. Wentworth watched the ashes fall ; and the servant came in to take away the tea and coffee cups. When this was done, and Ellen drew her chair to the table and took out her work, Mrs. Wentworth said, \" Aud what did you think of"], [18, "10 UPS AND DOWNS, Edward Vaughan, Ellen ? How is it I never knew of your acquaintance with him ? \" EUen coloured a little. \" You don't know quite everything about me, perhaps. How did I like him ? Well enough : he is pleasant and entertaining ; but his name is not too pleasantly associated in my mind. Just fancy the report ! Fancy such a thing being said, and being partly \u2014 that is, having just a slight foundation of truth in it. I don't know how to explain it; but you see we were much thrown together in that house for some weeks, and as you know him, you must be aware that his manner can be just a little particular, and that sort of thing. I shoidd suppose him a general admirer of womankind.\" \" You are mistaken there ! Where he likes and admires, I grant he lets his manner express very much, all he feels ; but Vaughan is quite fastidious in his taste. How very singular it is that you and he should have met, and I not to know it ! \" \" I only hope we may never meet again ! I wished to explain it all to papa, but he ordered me not to utter another word ; and added that when I asked his consent to the marriage, I should hear his ophiion of the whole proceeding ! \" \" Very strange ! \" muttered Mrs. Wentworth. \" Yes ! strange enough. But I never will stoop to tuideceive or explain again. If they can and will believe such things, they may. Why should I care? I will not,\" Ellen said, with quivering lips."], [19, "THE ABBEY. 11 \" I see no reason why you and Mr. Vaughan should not meet again ; on the contrary, I hope to see him here very soon : and is it possible you don't know he has taken Thorn House, six miles from this?

I know no one person equal to Edward Vaughan. I esteem and like him. Indeed, Lena, you must get over this absurd prejudice.\" \" I don't dislike him \u2014 there is no prejudice. I simply wish not to be thrown near him agam, owing to all that has been said.\" \"There is everything to recommend him. Family, fortune, ability, and a most thoroughly agreeable manner,\" remarked Mrs. Wentworth, resuming her knitting with a somewhat clouded face. \" Won't you give me a song, Worthy ? Do now ! And let us forget all disagreable things,\" and Ellen drew out the harp, placed a light and some music, and then playfully and coaxingly drew her friend towards it. The rest of the evening was passed in the delight of seeing and hearing Mrs. Wentworth. Nor was the promised history of the Abbey even remembered."], [20, "12 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER II. TO LONDON. Blair Hall was not long allowed to remain as quiet as Ellen found it for the first few days after her arrival. Morning visitors soon poured in to greet Mrs. Wentworth's return, and there was a succes sion of dinner parties, besides people staying in the house. Among the latter was a distant cousin of Mrs. Wentworth, a Miss Clare. Ellen had never seen her before, and at first was struck favourably by her lively and amusing manner. She was not prett}*, but had an agreeable countenance, though she was very near-sighted and wore spectacles. She was one of a large family, and had been accustomed to great thrift and management in domestic affairs, for her father was Vicar of a large parish and had but a straitened income. Four boys were launched in colonial life, and one son and five unmarried daucditers remained at home. Mrs. Wentworth, accustomed all her life to love and flatter}-, had never hked Mr. Clare's blunt and downright manner, and alto gether contrived to be as distant as she well could."], [21, "TO LONDON. 13 Mr. Clare was an independent character, and was quite as willing as herself to confine their inter course to occasional formal letters; but his wife could not consent to this. She considered a relation so rich as Mrs. Wentworth to be worth courting in every possible way. Many a honeyed word and affectionate inquiry did she contrive to in sinuate, unknown to her husband \u2014 many a pretty specimen of needlework, in the shape of mats, rugs, and screens, were sent with warm messages to Blah- Hall, when her daughters were mere children. As they grew up they were invited one by one for a month's visit. But except in the case of this one, Arabella, that desired and welcome invitation had never been repeated. The day after Miss Clare's arrival, it was Sunday ; Ellen retired to her room in order to read with the under-housemaid, the young girl whose attendance on herself she had petitioned for, and in whom she took some interest, which induced her to set herself the duty of trying to impress her with some higher principles then generally pervaded the servants' hall. In the midst of the reading, Miss Clara's head ancl spectacles appeared. \" Oh, I beg pardon ; didn't know you were en gaged ; only to ask you to take a stroll,\" and she retreated. \" How extremely good of you, Miss Raymond,\" she remarked, when an hour after Ellen joined her"], [22, "14 UPS AND DOWNS. in the verandah, and they walked up and down enjoying the fresh air. \" You 're fond of teaclung, I dare say.

I should fear, however, your post can't be very agreeable ? I daresay you find the servants resent any delegated authority \u2014 any interference \u2014 I couldn't undertake the situation myself on any account.\" \" What situation ? \" asked Ellen, looking at her in surprise. \" What do you suppose?\" \" ' Situation ' is perhaps not the right term exactly. But don't be afraid of me \u2014 I know my cousin so well, so very well ; and dearly, devotedly as I love her, one can't be positively blind to her little foibles. And I can quite conceive that you have much to bear, for she is exigeante, and things have been terribly neglected.\" \" I really don't understand you. If you allude to my reading to Nanny, I assure you, it is quite a private agreement between herself and myself \u2014 quite a voluntary act. Certainly I thought it right to ask Mrs. Wentworth's leave before \" \" I understand ! How enthusiastic you are, to be sure !

A little accustomed to exclusive devotion and that kind of thing ; but who would not offer it to such a shrine ? My dear father does not, I know, approve of quite so much dissipation, and we have thought her now and then just a little inclined to be selfish and forgetful of others. But one must remember all the temptations, and not judge too severely. Tell me now, does she \u2014 I hope and trust she does \u2014 but does she behave liberally to you \u2014 you who do so much for her?\" \"Really, Miss Clare, you strangely misunderstand things.

Do you know that Mrs. Wentworth was my mother's most intimate and earliest friend, and that she is my friend, and that as such I am here as her guest, and her guest only?\" \" Indeed ! \u2014 Oh, yes, of course ; only I did fancy I heard her say that this was your home. But I beg your pardon ; pray, forgive my stupid blunder- ing.\" Ellen tried to swallow down her he, which this"], [24, "16 UPS AND DOWNS. conversation had roused, and they spoke of other things till the dressing-bell summoned them in. A day or two after this, Ellen was hurt and surprised at seeing that something had visibly annoyed her friend. On going to her dressing room, Ellen felt at once, from the coldness of her manner, that Mrs. Wentworth was offended. \"Pray, don't trouble yourself to do that,\" Mrs. Wentworth said, as Ellen arranged her bouquet \u2014 her usual task. \" My maid can do it. Pray, don't take that trouble ! \" \" Trouble ! Oh, Worthy, and you know what a delight it is to me ! See, I thought you would wear your black velvet to-day, and I have chosen these lovely geraniums and roses. Indeed, I shall not give up my post to any one ! \" \"As you please; but assuredly I never asked the favour.\" Ellen looked at her, and saw there was something wrong. After putting up and undoing the flowers many times, unsuccessful in her annoyance, she said, \" If I only knew what has hurt you ! I am sure I have done something. Tell me what, please ! \" And she laid her hand gently on Mrs. Wentworth's arm. \" Ellen ! \" she said, after a pause, and with some agitation, \"have I ever asked you to do anything unbecoming or inconsistent with your being my guest and my friend's child ? Tell me frankly now :"], [25, "TO LONDON. 17 why should you so scornfully assert your indepen dence, and speak so disdainfully of being asked to do any httle thing for me ?

Oh, Worthy \u2014 you know I could not have spoken so ! You are only trying me ; I am sure you wouldn't believe anyone against your own heart's conviction. But \u2014 who has said so ?

Was it, could it be your cousin ? \" After some time Mrs. Wentworth confessed that it was Arabella wdio had spoken of Ellen's indig nant denial of being under any obligation whatever to Mrs. Wentworth, but on the contrary she had asserted all tlie obligation was on the other side ! The misunderstanding was soon made up between them, owing to Ellen's fearless frankness. But, henceforth, the lady in the golden spectacles was sedulously avoided by her, and some of the old Poole looks were revived for Miss Clare's benefit. Miss Clare took no offence, apparently. The only allusion she ever made to the cause of Ellen's annoy ance, was in remarking carelessly one day, that Mrs. Wentworth was rather absent and apt to hear a thing imperfectly, and go off with a wrong impres \u25a0 sion. By dint of making herself useful, amusing dull VOL. II. c"], [26, "18 UPS AND DOWNS. visitors, running of messages, and making divers pretty and really clever models in cardboard, taking a part in a glee, winch no one else knew, and other highly convenient acts, she succeeded in recovering her lost ground with Mrs. Wentworth ; wdio praised her as a \"good soul,\" a \"clever body,\" and one who gave herself no airs. The lady's maid liked and con- fided in her, relating all the causes for offence she had against Ellen, who usurped her rightful place in so many ways, and had the bad taste to prefer the help of an ignorant girl to her own condescending attend- ee o \u00a9 ance! Miss Clare managed to prolong her visit, much to Ellen's sorrow ; for each day made it clearer that the two could not pull together. Seeing Miss Clare's exaggerated caresses and adoration of Mrs. Went- worth, had the effect of keeping Ellen distant and cold to her friend : the sight of the spectacles acted very much as a refrigerator in company, and made her conscious of scrutiny not particularly partial. She took refuge in her own resources, paid \" Goody \" many visits, and whenever the weather allowed, she took long rambles to the old Abbey grounds, and sketched it in every point of view, dreaming some cxirious dreams meanwhile over her drawings. One day Mrs. Wentworth looked over her shoulder, as she put the last strokes to a picture. \" Why, that is really beautiful, Lena ! We shall have you quite an amateur artist, by and bv. Is"], [27, "19 TO LONDON. this your portfolio ? \" And she drew out, one after another, Ellen's collection. There were hasty sketches of her father, a more finished and very good likeness of Bessie, and an unfinished drawing, and several rough outlines of Hetty and Ruth, fancy portraits of all kinds and faces done from memory, of which one of old Goody Fleet was very striking. Mrs. Wentworth insisted on passing them round for general inspection, and a Major Kelly, himself no mean draughtsman, was loud in his praise, as well as judicious in his criticism. \"You have the gift decidedly, Miss Raymond. Good teaching and hard practice will do wonders.\" \" Ellen must have a master. What do you say to our taking a run to town ? I must or I ought to be there on business, hateful word ! We shall come hi for the season in its full bloom, and see the exhibi tions, and while I am wearied to death with lawyers, you may have lessons. What do you say, Lena ? \" \" Delightful ! Just what I have always specially desired,\" exclaimed Ellen, joyously. \"Ah, yes I Such an advantage, and get really good masters ! \" sighed Miss Clare. \" But we could never have that benefit. We all taught ourselves.\" \" You have taught yourself to some purpose,'\" observed the gallant Major. \"Your models are first rate. Do you draw? I should suppose you must and do so.\" \" A little, in a very humble w*ay. I have quite a c 2"], [28, "20 UPS AND DOWNS. passion for 'Art, but hi a country town one has so few advantages.\" Poor Arabella's sighs and regrets and amiable congratulations on Ellen's good fortune did not procure her an invitation to make one of the party to London. She left, having offended Watkins mightily by fishing for and obtaining a certain handsome silk, wliich Mrs. Wentworth considered unbecoming to herself, and which had been long silently appro priated by her maid. A cameo broach, with Mrs. Wentworth's face cut in it, Arabella assured her cousin would henceforth be her favourite ornament ; while to Ellen, who also had one, she observed that tlie setting was very trumpery and unworthy of the giver. Three days after, Ellen found herself rolling along in luxurious fashion, drawn by four good horses, her friend by her side and \" all to herself,\" as she smilingly said, every mile bringing her nearer the great city. The notion of seeing London for the first time must always be exciting, at least where tlie mind is sufficiently open to comprehend its wonder and its deep sources of interest, to feel the beauty and the poetry of the grand \" Idea.\" The concen tration of all that is high and great and noble, side by side with all that is most vile and most wretched \u2014 the pivot on which business and pleasure turn \u2014 the heart, in fact, of our country. Ellen's expectations were raised to their utmost"], [29, "TO LONDON. 21 pitch. To see London had been a very old desire, but to see it in this way, with her chosen friend and with all the smoothness which wealth can brino- \u2014 was better than even her fancy had ever pictured as possible. Her spirits were like those of a child. She laughed and chattered gaily, and every incident, even to a lame horse at one stage, served to please and amuse her. As they drew near the city, however, she became silent and even pale. Not one remark did she utter as they drove through the streets : Mrs. Wentworth thought her tired, and being herself a poor traveller was quite content to leave the silence unbroken. It was some years since Mrs. Wentworth had visited London regularly, and when she went abroad she sold her town house. It never suited her health to be there long. So now they were to stay at a fashionable hotel. There was no sleep for Ellen that first night. The dull, continuous rumble of carriages made her realize the fact that she was actually in London ! She felt restless and impatient to be out in the streets, at one moment, while at another, she rather dreaded the idea. Deep down, folded closely up, and resolutely put out of her own sight as it were, lay a feeling, which perhaps had something to do with the anxious flutter of expecta tion she experienced, Often the thought asked admittance, but it was sternly put back. \" I shall see some beautiful paintings to-morrow ;"], [30, "22 UPS AND DOWNS. I shall hear an opera ; I shall look on the real West minster Abbey. All the splendid shops, too ! How I should like to go with some one who knew all about it and enjoyed it, to the old law courts and gardens, and see those places that Charles Lamb loved. I know one who but nonsense, ridicu lous! If he does happen to be here, it is most unlikely that we should meet ; impossible, in fact : iu this big wilderness of houses ancl streets, there is no chance of such a thing.\" '6' Yet in spite of this assurance, her heart beat quickly many times in the course of the morning at the sight of a tall man. A man's hat had more interest for her than all the celebrated buildings to which her attention was drawn by Mrs. Wentworth. \" Why, Lena, who would have supposed that you, with all your romance and wish to see the great city, should positively be so taken up with the crowds of foot passengers, that I have to jog your attention and draw you up from common-place prose to beauty!\" \" Is it common-place prose ? at least, is it nothing beyond, when one thinks that each individual of that busy crowd has his own separate history, his life struggle, his joy, and his disappointment? How I should like a fairy-glass to read the history of some of them.

But who do you see ? Have you lit on an acquaintance ? \" \" No,\" Ellen sighed, and she leant back, deter mined not to be so very foolish. By dint of strong effort, she kept her mind fixed on all the \" sights,\" and was really dazzled and delighted by a visit to one of the great shops. Then they visited the Royal Academy, and when she got over the first distraction caused by the crowd and the dust and heat, EUen forgot all and every thing before the pictures. There were several very striking ones. Her whole heart and soul were stirred at one of the Virgin and Child going to Egypt ; the golden sunset light on the Virgin's face, the purple hills, and the. severe simplicity of the party travelling steadfastly along, struck her deeply. It awakened all her old wild dreams of exceding in the art of drawing. Why should she not one day be able to produce such a picture? It would be worth any amount of labour and study, and she had more leisure time than she knew how to employ. Why should she not cultivate the gift God had given her, and carry it out to its furthest capability, instead of being content to draw \"prettily,\" and have a \" o-ood notion of taking a likeness?\" \" That is a beautiful thing ; but there are others more worthy of your study,\" remarked a low and familiar voice close behind her. She suppressed a"], [32, "24 UPS AND DOWNS. start, and blushed, as she tried to turn round, but found herself wedged in by other spectators. \" I have been here since eleven, two hours and more. I little thought I should meet you. I saw your friend ; I recognised Mrs. Wentworth just now in the other room, and then I knew, or I thought it likely, you must be here.\" \" I quite forgot her,\" said Ellen, hurriedly ; \" I forgot all about her; where is she?\" \" With some acquaintance, at the other end of the room,\" said Granville Mortimer. \" One is sure to get divided from one's companions here, and not unfrequently to lose sight of one another altogether. But there is no enjoyment of pictures Avithout perfect freedom to look where, and as long as one likes. When did you come ? \" \" Only yesterday ; it was a sudden move. I never was in London before.\" \" Do you like it \u2014 like living here, I mean?\" She had w*orked round now, and was standing face to face. \" It does very well. After all, places are pretty much alike to me, I believe.\" He looked at her fixedly for a moment, while she was watching Mrs. Wentworth, and feeling some dread at what would be the meeting between her and Granville. \" Have you heard from Bessie lately?\" he asked, \" Yes ; not long ago. Poor Bessie ! she was"], [33, "TO LONDON. 25 in trouble, I saw, though she did not actually say so.\" Granville looked very grave: \"I fear she is,\" he said. \" But will you allow me to show you the picture which, after four visits to this place, I fix on? It is very near your friend,\" he added, seeing her hesitate. He helped her through the crowd, and after some skilful management he made a place for her to look at the picture. He was pointing out its beauties, when Mrs. Wentworth touched her arm, whispering, \u2014 \" Who is it ? \" and directly after said aloud. \" I fear we must be going, Ellen : we will come here again ; but to-day, you know, I have an engagement.\" Ellen looked sorry, and she felt uncertain and shy about introducing Mr. Mortimer to Mrs. Wentworth. The lady to whom Mrs. Wentworth had been speak ing observed this, and said that she should not leave for another hour. If Mrs. Wentworth's young friend liked she should be happy to take her in charge, and she would drive her home. \" It is a pity not to give a look at the principal pictures,\" remarked Granville ; \" and a second visit will still be very advisable. If I may be allowed, I shall be only too glad to escort Miss Raymond : I have a little Poole news to tell her.\" He addressed himself to Mrs. Wentworth, who put on a look of surprise which she knew well how to assume. She knew who he was, but she found it convenient not to"], [34, "26 UPS AND DOWNS. seem to do so. Ellen had seldom felt more awkward ; but she did not show it. She had a certain power of veiling her feelings ; and hardly ever suffered it to appear, even if she did feel ill at ease. \"Let me introduce Mr. Granville Mortimer to you,\" she said to Mrs. Wentworth, with a look, which plainly bespoke her forbearance and kind ne ss. The lady bowed gracefully, and the gentleman much more cordially than Ellen expected. It was with a feeling of intense relief \u2014 even joy, that she heard Granville, in his best manner, commence a conversation with Mrs. Wentworth about some pictures in Italy. It surprised her. She could not understand his evident desire to be agreeable to one of whom he had said such bitter things. Whatever was the reason, however \u2014 whatever had past and whatever was to come \u2014 this present moment had its own pleasure, and Ellen was not one to reject it. Her mother was not mistaken when she believed her to have strength ; for to be hopeful in spite of re peated disappointments, is to be strong, in some sense. It was this elasticity of mind which kept her still young, fresh, and ardent, after so much trouble, and whicli gave an indescribable charm to her character. Glad to forget troubles and fears, and possessed with the power of keen enjoyment, she willingly and entirely threw herself mto the spirit of the hour,"], [35, "TO LONDON. 27 and without forethought of evil, accepted what she could not account for ; and soon, in the happiness of finding her two friends bent on being agreeable and gracious to each other, she forgot to wonder at it. Mrs. Wentworth lingered, in spite of her previous engagement. Mr. Granville Mortimer led her to his favourite pictures, and they compared impressions and recollections of Rome and Florence; she, now and then, appealing to Ellen so as to make her one of the party. But he seemed to devote himself exclu sively to Mrs. Wentworth, and neither looked nor spoke to Ellen. The truth was he had not the ease and grace of manner which this charming woman of the world had to a great degree. For some reason he desired to please Mrs. Wentworth, and he was sincerely occupied and eager about the paintings : he always went straight to the point, whatever it might be. Ellen smiled quietly, so well knowdng his way ; but she did not mind the apparent neglect : every word, every glance, was a secret triumph. To see him evidently fascinated by one he had professed to judge so hardly, and to see her unbend and yield to his quiet, earnest enthusiasm, actually deeming it worth whde to please him \u2014 a Mortimer ! Ellen smiled again. \" I really must go ! I am very sorry ; but must is a hard word ! Since you wish to remain Ellen, and Mr. Mortimer offers to take you in charge but, what amuses you ? \" she added, suddenly, catching"], [36, "28 UPS AND DOWNS. the expression of fun and pleasure which Ellen could not conceal. \" Thank you ! Yes \u2014 oh, was I smiling ? Must you go, Worthy, really ? \" stammered Ellen. \" Yes ; \" Mrs. Wentworth repeated she must, and taking Granville's arm, she went to her carriage. Ellen followed, but returned with him to visit an other room \u2014 the one full of portraits and miniatures. \" Do you like London ? \" she asked, presently. \" Why do you smile ? \" she added, quickly, catching an amused expression. \"I beg your pardon,\" he said, \"but you asked, and I answered, that question just now.\" Ellen coloured up, half annoyed, but he went on \u2014 \" At present I am tired of it, and long for a country ramble, and probably I shall run down to my friend Damer.\" He paused, looking as if he wished for some remark, but as she did not speak, he said, presently \u2014 -. \" Do you know, I am lodging with a friend of yours.\" \" Mine ? Who can it be ? \" \" Mrs. Humphrey, your pupil's aunt. I often hear your praises sung, I assure you.\" \" That must be good, even for its novelty ! It must at least be a change after Poole,\" answered Ellen, with lurking fun in her eye. \" So you are in the same house with Lily ! Can you tell me if she is going on well ? \" \" That I cannot. I hardly ever see her. I wish often she waited on me, instead of her smooth and"], [37, "TO LONDON. 29 pompous aunt. I believe she has some occupation. I think I heard, she spent the greater part of the day out.\" \" Yes. She teaches some children. She is a daily governess ? \" \" Indeed ! Is she sufficiently educated for that ? \" \" WeU, Lily has good abilities and is fond of improving herself. She is proud too ; and, poor girl, altogether too refined for her station, I fear. Ah ! I see by your face you think that is my doing \u2014 my fault.\" \" Your doing, yes ; but why need it be a fault ? But it must be a sad life of drudgery that teaching small children. And, perhaps, as you say, it is not for her ease or peace to be above those with whom she mixes, unless she has the right kind of mind to be truly and really above all littleness.\" \" I don't know,\" Ellen said, doubtingly. \" Lily is pretty, and I should say, she is more sweet and lovely than high or great. Sometimes I feel anxious for her.\" \" You are really fond of her? She is, according to her aunt, devoted to you. Well,\" he added, looking at her, \"it will be a new interest to me. I have stupidly overlooked it hitherto. But it is just possible I may be of some use to her, by way of lending her books, or helping her to get on with that aunt.\" \" Thank you ! But you alarm me by the way"], [38, "30 UPS AND DOWNS. you say ' that aunt.' What is she ? She wrote very kindly about Lily's coming to her, and in a sensible way ; in fact, the style of her letters made me fancy her rather above the common.\" \" Depend on it, she hired a scribe then,\" he said, laughing. \"No; Mrs. Humphrey is strong in the matter of clean windows and well broiled mutton chops ; but there is nothing above the common in her, unless it be her extreme egotism and self com placency, her broad and hard vulgarity. You have not seen her.\" \" Not yet. But she is anxious to make my acquaintance, and she is to bring Lily to-morrow evening. I am so sorry she is what you say. I know how very bad it will be for Lily : bad in every way. Her pride and fastidiousness will serve to keep her out of scrapes, in the common meaning of the term ; but it will so try her, make her supercilious and conceited, I fear, and drive her perhaps to dangers. I wish she had never left Poole ; and yet \" She stopped, with a sudden recollection of the wish which had not long ago been so strong, to get the girl away from there by any means. Her brother- in -law's countenance, and his objection able, coarse, and familiar manner of speaking of Lily were vividly recalled. Granvdle observed her look of annoyance and gravity, and attributed it to anxiety for Lily's present position. He again pro mised to make a point of cultivating her acquaintance,"], [39, "TO LONDON. 31 and giving her at least that not always acceptable help, good advice. He smiled a little, looking amused. \"I suppose you think the pupil may follow the teacher in that matter,\" Ellen said, colouring up, but smiling too. He offered his arm, as they turned to find their way towards the door. After a moment's silence he said, in a low voice, \" I know I was rude, impetuous, perhaps unpardonably officious, when I urged my advice so on you. I had no right to do so : I presumed too much on our old, easy intimacy.\" \" You did not \u2014 you do not know enough to be a judge,\" she answered, in a gentle, pleading tone, very different from her manner at times. \" Advice, however good in the abstract, is useless, unless it is founded on a knowledge of the chcumstances. You think you know a great deal \u2014 everything about me, because we were \u2014 once \u2014 because \" she went on more rapidly, \" we knew each other as boy and girl, and because your brother is my sister's husband and your aunt my father's friend. But you don't know. Truth is sometimes hard to get at. No ; you know nothing about it.\" \" And may I not know ? or am I to be a mere stranger? I hear, and I see, and on that I judge and form conclusions ; but, Ellen \" \" Don't let us begin about it,\" she said, quickly, and with a faltering voice. \"It is such intense"], [40, "32 UPS AND DOWNS. relief to throw it off. Do let us meet this once without words and misunderstanding \u2014 if we can,\" she added, rather sadly. \" Like any mere acquaintance, talking of general things, and eschewing any approach to confidence,\" he answered, coldly, and in a vexed tone. \" Will you walk, or is it too far ? \" he asked, when they reached the entrance. \" Walk, unless you are in any hurry.\" \" My work can wait. I have a few holidays, and can afford another hour.\" Soon he talked again of pictures, going back, to those he had picked out in the Exhibition ; but his manner had resumed the dry and somewhat stiff tone she disliked in him, and her pleasure was gone. She was almost glad when they reached the hotel. He insisted on seeing her up-stairs, and they found Mrs. Wentworth returned, and reclining after her fatigues. She graciously pressed Granville to stav and join their dinner. He doubted a little, and looked towards Ellen, but her face was turned awav. Then he remembered letters which must be written, but said if he might be allowed, he would \"look in\" after work, in the course of the evening, and bring a sketch he had spoken of. \" I didn't think a Mortimer could be so toler able,\" said Mrs. Wentworth, yawning. \" Havn't I ' done the polite' to your connection now ?

But rest, my dear, pray ; you look so tired \u2014 actually you are stiffened by being with him. Those good, clever, awful bodies, how I do tire of them ! It is overwhelming !

D VOL. II."], [42, "34 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER III. \"ARE WE RIVALS?\" Me. Vaughan came for dinner, and Ellen's first feeling of annoyance and awkwardness in meeting him, vanished before the pleasant, sparkhng con versation he kept up with her friend. It was not possible \u2014 at least, for one so keen in her appreciation of all that is brilliant, and pleasant, and well bred \u2014 to dwell on any trouble. She aUowed herself to be carried on with the stream, and soon found herself doing battle with him, as before at Mrs. UUathorne's, and trying to prove her opinion right against Mr. Vaughan's notions. He was all animation, and evidently enjoyed provoking her to argue, drawing her out in a skilful masterly manner. Time had dealt gently with Edward Vaughan ; the added experience and knowledge of years gave a finish and completeness which amply compensated for the loss of youth's bloom. His manners, always tinctured with a chivalrous courtesy and gentle ness and full of vivacity, had now also the confidence and authority which comes with riper age. The"], [43, "\"ARE WE RIVALS?\" 35 beaut}* of his face did not rest with features or colouring : it was the play, the ever-varying expres sion, and the gesture and attitude, which earned him the title of a handsome man. The few hnes and silvery hairs which were there no one thought of, and though he was apt to com plain, with a winning smile, of sundry rheumatic pains, and enlarged sometimes on the subject of remedies, no one could for a moment associate him with the \" gouty, elderly gentleman,\" he playfully asserted himself to be ; even his habit of taking snuff, for which Mrs. Wentworth rallied and scolded him, was passed over in admiration of the manner in whicli he tapped his gold box, and the genuine, bright enjoyment he owned in it. His reception of EUen was exactly one to win her. There was abundance of warmth in the hearty shake of the hand, and just a touch of deeper and more tender sentiment in the look he bent on her, whde his words and voice were those of an old friend, privileged by his greater age to meet her more than half way, qualifying that empressment which might otherwise have been just a little too much. With Mrs. Wentworth he was different : playfully, and yet with a peculiar way of his own, which gave the impression of a very tender heart, he paid her homage, making no secret of his admiration, and by his consummate tact and good breeding, stopping short of what might have been in less skilful hands, objectionable. They had not d 2"], [44, "36 UPS AND DOWNS. met for some time, and there was much to say on both sides ; while EUen was only too content to look, to listen, and admire, and secretly wish that there were more really pleasant people in the world. Mr. Vaughan did not leave the ladies long after dinner. He drew his seat near Ellen and, lowering his voice, made inquiries after her sister and father, neither of whom he had ever seen. \" If you have any secret confidences to make, good people, now is your time,\" said Mrs. Went worth, as she covered her face with her handker chief and professed her intention to rest her ej-es and head. \" You asked for my niece,\" remarked Mr. Vaughan, directly, in a somewhat louder voice, still addressing EUen, \" she is just going to be married : I hope you will see her, for she is in town, making purchases. What a relief to me, just conceive ! to have this charge taken off my hands.\" \" Married ! How old one is getting. Fancy little Letty married ! \" \" Yes, indeed. But I am not sorry to give up my office. At my time of hfe to be dragged about to balls and archery meetings &c. is rather terrible.\" \" I should think you will miss her.\" \" Yes ; perhaps so. What do you say, what do you advise, Miss Raymond? Shall I venture, or is it too late ? Must I be condemned to the life of"], [45, "\" ARE WE RIVALS ? \" 37 a bachelor, and give up all hopes of getting a wife to nurse my rheumatism ? \" \" Hear him,\" said Mrs. Wentworth, sleepily : \"Edward, one would suppose you were really an old man. How very absurd you are, really. Hark ! I hear steps. Ellen, dear, do ring for lights; it will shock your model man to come in and find us all in the dark. London air makes me very dull and sleepy.\" Before EUen could do as she was bidden, Mr. Mortimer was announced, and Mrs. Wentworth unwillingly roused herself to introduce her two guests. She then invited Granville to a seat by her, which he took in silence. EUen was not able to observe how he got on with Mrs. Wentworth, for her attention was claimed by Mr. Vaughan, who inquired if that was one of the family into which her sister had married. And EUen detected a shade of coldness in his manner, Avhen she said, \" Yes.\" To Ellen's surprise, Mrs. Wentworth chose to exert her powers and devote her almost exclusive attention on Granville. Was it that tlie habit of commanding admiration w-as so strong in her that even one she professed to despise and dislike, must be won over ; or was she really influenced by that simple earnestness which Ellen thought so very strikino-? However it was, the conversation did not become general, and EUen gave up the hope"], [46, "38 UPS AND DOWNS. of being able to say another word about Lily Day. She could not help being half amused at the question ing and surprised glances which Mr. Vaughan con stantly threw towards the sofa. Ellen thought he was more than half jealous of Mrs. Wentworth's attentions ; and in his questions, \" What is he ? What is he going to do ? \" there was a slight touch of depreciation, if not contempt. \" One of your Poole beaux ? Aye, indeed ! A sort of family genius. I understand ; bepraised and idolized by mamma and sisters, and the hero of a country town.\" \" No such thing, I assure you. He is the last man to be a ' hero,' as you so sarcastically call it.\" Ellen's annoyance was plainly shown. Mr. Vaughan laughed and looked keenly at her. \" WeU, we won't quarrel. No doubt he is some thing too good for my appreciation. One of the new lights, I can tell, bythe very set of his whiskers. But there is undoubted power in his brow. I am a bit of a phrenogolist, and I see your friend \u2014 for he evidently is your friend, Miss Raymond \u2014 has brains.\" Then he began admiring Mrs. Wentworth, repeating anecdotes of her conquests, years ago, when he first met her and \" fell up to his chin in love.\" Ellen's pleased and unflagging attention warmed him in his subject. There was a little move, and Mrs. Wentworth was looking for a newspaper, to show Granville somethin a-"], [47, "\"ARE WE RIVALS?\" 39 she referred to. Mr. Vaughan, with ready gallantry rose to search. Granville made a feint at looking under a pde of books, and then drew near to EUen. \" On my return home, I found a letter from my eldest sister. Have you heard anything from Poole?\" \" No, nothing. You have heard bad news, I see. What is it?\" \" What perhaps I shoidd be wiser not to repeat. It is about John. I fear his affairs are getting into a bad state. I can't make it out : he started so weU, and with such a good practice. By the way, is that the Mr. Vaughan? \" '\u2022' Yes. He was called Manners,\" and Ellen, greatly to her annoyance, felt herself blushing. \u2022\u2022' Do you like hhn ? \" he asked, turning over the leaves of a book somewhat nervously, and not raising his eyes. \" Yes, very much \u2014 as a companion : he is so very pleasant\" \" You saw much of him, I think, at Mrs. Ulla thorne's?\" \" A good deal.

I believe he has been in Paris with his niece, and now he says she is going to be married.\" The newspaper was found, atid Mrs. Wentworth pointed out what she had spoken of. Mr. Vaughan entered into the subject, and EUen bent over a book, and thought of the Poole news. She was roused hy Granville's bidding her good-night. She held out her hand. \" Shall I see you again ? \" he asked. \" Oh, if you are here so long as that, I shall certainly call. What shall I say to Lily?\" \" I shall see her to-morrow,\" EUen said ; \" her aunt is to bring her.\" He was gone \u2014 Mrs. Wentworth rubbed her hands and smiled. \" Noav, I have done my duty. Confess, Lena, I Avas A-ery agreeable; I surely melted some of the ice. But, oh, the misery, the gene of having such a creature on hand. Such a constant strain as it is ; my A-ery neck aches, I do assure you. So lofty, and heroic, and downright.

EUen was to devote one hour daily to a drawing lesson, and the rest Avas to be given up to sight-seeing and hearing.

At which tlie aunt reprimanded her for bad manners, and assured Miss Raymond, that he was just a Aery excellent and religious young gentle man, so regular, and so industrious, and so civil spoken. Only she feared he worked OAer hard, and didn't get fresh air enough. As to being afraid of him, it was just ridiculous nonsense in Lily. For e\\Ter since he came to the house, no one had ever heard a bad or a rough Avord out of his lips.

There were a good many meetings on theAA-hole; and Ellen found herself hi a circle which, being new to her, was amusing : she was not sorry to hear that after the wedding, and when Mr. Vaughan's new house was ready, a visit from the neAvly married couple was fixed on ; and that Mrs. WentAVorth engaged the whole party to visit Blah. \" The Captain is quite a man of the world: in fact, one of my sort,\" said Mrs. Wentworth, \" and he is to bring his friend and cousin Colonel Sharpe: rather ' fast' and so on, between ourselves, and I should say a dangerous person to be quite so near a A*ery young Avife.

And considering his ofttimes sharp and irritable speeches, and his almost kicking them away, like troublesome puppies, it was Avonderful Iioav very little afraid they were of him. When in the mood for it, his brilliant smile and his humorous manner Avon them. In fact, among his patients, many a mother had inwardly blessed him for so charming the little sufferers, that with a tear in the eye there was often a smile on the lip. He passed off a painful necessity with a joke, and even sometimes sang a merry song to beguile their thoughts from lancet or knife. If the child was pretty, he would caress it, and he owned many a little \" sweetheart,\" and \" wife\" among the circle, Avho forgot the bitter potion which would follow, and gave him warm and loving welcome. But this evening there was no joke, no smile for Lisa ; and she stood slightly apart, gazing and wondering, half longing to go up to him, and yet withheld by some-"], [57, "OLIVE BRANCHES. 49 thing in his attitude. He leant on his elbow, slowly and absently pushing up his hair, on Avhich the set ting sun cast one of its last beams, making it shine like burnished gold. Yet it Avas not so carefully arranged as usual. John Mortimer Avas generally particular in the extreme, and faultlessly neat and clean, from his hair or his hat to his boots. Noav he bore the marks of a long day's toil, and his well-fitting boots and tight Avere bespattered Avith mud, his shirt cuff's looked less bright, smooth, and white than usual. But in his face there was the greatest change : a shadow Avas oA-er it. He sat A-ery still, gazing, as it J seemed, out of AvindoAV, till it became a stare. Then he suddenly moA-ed and received the cup of tea his Avife held toAvards him, SAvalloAved it hastily, hot though it Avas, and then for the first time his eye fell on his child. She had moA*ed a very little nearer to him. He held out a piece of his toast, but she said, \" No, thank you,\" shyly. \" Why, Avhat's the matter, that you refuse anything eatable ? You astonish me, Miss Mortimer.\" She came close to him, and while he pushed his cup to Bessie to be replenished, he lifted her on his knee. She began to count his buttons, a favourite play of hers. He mo\\-ed here and there, and held out his hand at her bidding ; but the froAvn deepened and he gave a loud sigh, which was, indeed, partly a groan, and Avhich Avas softly but deeply echoed by his Avife.

John had finished his tea and left his toast untouched ; he was still grave and pre-occupied. \" There has been a letter from Granville,\" Bessie gently remarked, after a time. \" He appears to Avork hard and is needing a little change.

On the floor lay some sacks and a heap of apples. The paper Avas mouldy, and hung in tatters. The once pure white marble chimney-piece was chipped and stained. There were stiU a feAV rusty nails in the Avail, showing where pictures had once hung. Mrs. Wentworth looked round in an excited, wdd way, very unusual to her, and then half fretfully, half in sorrow, scolded EUen for being so long. \" It was enough to give any one bad dreams and bring on a nervous attack, to be left so long alone in such a horrible place : so like, yet so unlike \u2014 everything unaltered, but left to decay and ruin.

Mrs. Wentworth suffered from one of her severe headaches, and did not appear at dinner, so Mr. Vaughan reluctantly took leave, much to EUen's rehef. He had, however, been very kind and help ful ; more reliable than she had expected he would be in such a case. She felt quite at her ease with him, for he assumed a protecting, friendly manner, which made her forget Mrs. Wentworth's wishes and Poole gossip. \" Leave me, my love, to Watkins.

She rambled about in some favourite fields, from which the sea could be seen, and the distant fishing boats or collier brigs. The hanging woods of the Abbey, in their first spring leaf, looked exquisitely tender and soft, as the Avhite fog rolled beneatli, following the curve of the Abbey stream, and graduaUy rising, spread abroad in the vivid sun rays. Ellen's heart beat with pride and regret, as she looked, and remembered Avhat her family had been, and to what it was now reduced. Again she thought, \" If I AA-as only a man ! \" And again croAvded in many half-shaped, excited thoughts and dreams; all of Avhich ended in her making a very hurried break fast, on learning that Mrs. Wentworth Avas not aAvake yet, and not to be disturbed tdl she rang : and then setting about her drawing with unusual eagerness,"], [89, "MRS.

The other seemed to be from Lily, but the Avriting Avas rather changed. She hastily opened this last. It was from Lily, written from bed. She had been very ill : indeed, even dangerously ; oAving to a severe chill from sitting in Avet clothes. She had lost her engagement, in consequence ; and her aunt was vexed, and now the danger Avas over, showed some annoyance, and scolded her for being a fine lady, and said she ought to learn a trade or go into service. Poor girl ! she Avrote in depressed spirits, and asked Ellen's advice. Mr. Mortimer had been kind in VOL. II. 0"], [90, "82 UPS AND DOWNS. lending her books, she said, but tdl just now, she had been too ill to read. Colonel Raymond's letter was a formal and pom pous announcement of his approaching marriage with Mrs. Hay. He proceeded to inform his daughter that he intended to let North House, and they were going at once to Germany, where some mineral waters had been advised for Mrs. Hay. Should Ellen desire to leave her present quarters, she might join them ; providing she intended giving the duty of a daughter to her new mother, who was ready to bestow the fondest affection on them all. Arrangements had been made for Hetty and Ruth to remain with Mrs. Harding. Alick had joined his regiment, and would, the Colonel hoped, see the necessity for greater manliness and steadiness for the future : at all events he would not be suf fered to wear out his poor mother as he had done. When Mrs. Wentworth came down, looking pale and invalidish, Ellen gave her her father's letter, saying in something of a broken voice, in spite of her efforts to seem indifferent, \" Of course, one knew that it would be sooner or later ; and no doubt my absence has expedited the matter. I join them in Germany ! No ! I Avould sooner be a governess \u2014 serve apprentice to a dress-maker. . . . .\" \"Fortunately, neither will be necessary,\" said Mrs. Wentworth, after hastily reading the letter. \" This is your home, as you know.

Besides, (I hardly know why I was led on to waste words on him,) but I entered on the subject and stated my reasons freely and frankly ; causing him to open those blue eyes of his wide. I alluded to a thing or two, and asked if he could consider that a good home for you; and \" \" And \u2014 well ? \" said Ellen, eagerly, as her friend paused. \" WeU ! he had not much to answer, only some stuff about a child's place and so on ; and giving me a gentle side rap at the time, warning me not to spoil you.

While Ellen felt in her inmost heart that no one was ever half so sweet or so beautiful as her friend, how could any one dare to judge her harshly ! She wished that Granville Mortimer knew her better. What a triumph it would be to make him confess that he was wrong : to see him wholly charmed, as everyone else was who came within her influence. \" And whose writing may this be ? \" asked Mrs. Wentworth, turning over Lily's letter, whde Ellen was wrapt in these thoughts. \" Oh, this is the pet pupd.

Then, as if to prove this no singular case, she rapidly covered the table with outlines ; some in pen and ink, others in colours, others in chalks: some the merest outlines, others more finished. Among many others, there was a spirited, but some what caricatured likeness of Miss Arabella Clare; at which, Mrs. Wentworth laughed in delight, and declared she must have it framed.

The sun threw long shadows across the mossy lawn, and catching the crystal drops from the lamp which swung from the ceiling, turned them into rainbow jewels. Then it fell on the soft buff satin coverings, and, leaving a line of light on the rich carpet, touched a group of alabaster statuettes, bringing out their beauty. It was a scene for an artist to enjoy ! this handsome room, so fitly and luxuriously arranged, with its deep recesses and sweeping drapery. Ellen looked up from her flowers, at Mrs. Wentworth standing in the soft shade by her harp, twisting up a stray string, in her almost queenly robe of dark maroon velvet, relieved by a shawl of the finest lace, which only half hid white and round arms such as few at any age could boast of \u2014 and adding grace to her always soft outline. There was never any study in Mrs. Wentworth's attitudes. At first sight people were impressed with her simplicity and thorough want of all affectation. Yet \u2014 and she knew it \u2014 whichever way she stood, or moved, or reclined, it might have been a study for a painter. As it was, EUen longed for a pencil : if she could but \"jot down \" a few lines,"], [107, "A DRIVE AND A DRAWING-ROOM LECTURE. 99 just to remember the pose \u2014 the harp \u2014 the lady \u2014 the back ground of curtains and the mellow, subdued light \u2014 one bracelet and the tips of the fingers and the edge of the harp being just caught by the gleam \u2014 it was a picture ! \" How beautiful ! \" she could not help whispering : and, were the truth known, the words were echoed by the two gentlemen who at that moment were ushered in. But their eyes were caught by another part of the picture ; EUen herself \u2014 in her no-coloured silk dress, hanging in deep and rich folds, with no trimming to break the fall, and nothing to disturb the neutral tint but her bright hair and the two choice roses in her girdle \u2014 was too attractive an object to be overlooked. Mr. Vaughan paused for an instant ; not imme diately seeing the lady of the house in the shadow. He thought he had never before known how beauti ful EUen was. While the other gentleman, a Mr. Staunton, son and heir to a wealthy invahd squire in the adjoining parish, told his sisters the next morn ing, \" That at last he knew what auburn hair was ! He had heard of it always, and had been deluded into believing that his three sisters had it, consider ing it a deuced ugly colour too ; but now he had been introduced to the real article.\" \" Where had he seen it ? \" they asked : \" for certainly Mrs. Wentworth's hair was not auburn, unless she had had it newly dyed lately.

Rather odd for Dr. and Mrs. Edgehill to go there so much. It was not a place ladies much frequented.

At these remarks, intended to annihilate auburn hair and Blair Hall, Mr. Staunton had twirled his moustache and crossed his legs vigorously ; and after a prolonged whistle, he had remarked, that Countess or Duchess, he didn't care. \u2014 Blair was out-and-out the pleasantest house to dine at in the whole county. There was a first rate cook and cellar; to say nothing of two such lovely and charming women as were not to be met elsewhere \u2014 and who were delightful enough to rouse plenty of envy and Ul nature. He advised his sisters to take care at the approaching race ball, for if they had believed themselves belles with auburn hair, they would find it not quite so easy to maintain the reputation now. He would'nt mind making a bet, he knew who would be the belle, &c. But this is a digression \u2014 and only excusable as a means of accounting for the prolonged gaze which Mr. Staunton bestowed on Miss Raymond's hair. It struck him so much that, though usually talkative, he did not open his lips till another entrance caused"], [109, "A DRIVE AND A DRAWING-ROOM LECTURE. 101 a move, and Ellen coming out of the light to greet Dr. and Mrs. Edgehill, he ventured to remark to Mr. Vaughan, \" What splendid hair ! \" \" Very peculiar. Like some old Italian pictures,\" was the answer. Dr. Edgehill was still a fine man, looking every inch a church dignitary. With high marked features, and a well toned sonorous voice, which at once proclaimed ignorance of and contempt for such a complaint as a weak throat, his fine silvered hair and rather bald head wrere the only marks that time had made. His figure was as upright and firm, and his eye as keen and bright, as when Mrs. Wentworth's father had presented the living of Blair to him. And his wife did him credit; though years had told rather more on her charms. But at the first glance, one could see she had been pretty; and there was a certain beauty now in the graceful manner she bore her years and their effects, and her quiet, thoroughly well chosen dress. Her eye brightened, and there was a warm pressure of the hand, when Ellen came up to her : while Mrs. Wentworth was well pleased to turn from them, and speak to the Rector. \" Which colour do you favour, Miss Raymond ? \" asked Mr. Staunton, coming round to her side. Ellen did not understand at first. \" Mr. Staunton alludes to the election ; do you not?\" said Mrs. Edgehill ; \" and, of course, it is blue,\" she added, laying her hand on Ellen's arm playfully."], [110, "102 UPS AND DOWNS. \"I hope not, Mrs. Edgehill. Purple would become Miss Raymond weU.\" \" Not so well as blue.

I feel sure you cannot be a Tory.\" Ellen only laughed. \" She is, of course, what her friends have been before her. The Raymonds are always Tories,\" said Mrs. Edgehill, with a little dignity. \" That wouldn't influence me, I believe \u2014 at least, not alone. I am naturally perverse, and go by contraries.\" \" I knew it \u2014 I said so ! \" said Mr. Staunton. Then he lowered his voice : \" It was a shame of Vaughan not to stand. You know, of course, he had a requisi tion ? and he is just the man.\" \"Why did he refuse?\" \" He didn't like the trouble. He is such a lazy fellow ; \u2014 such a man for the dolce far niente.\" Ellen's lips curled, but she checked the words which were ready. Sir Frederic and Lady de Lisle were now an nounced, and in the move which ensued, the little trinket-laden bride took Ellen's seat on the couch by Mrs. Edgehill, and Ellen went towards a window"], [111, "A DRIVE AND A DRAWING-ROOM LECTURE. 103 to take a last look at this first summer evening. Mr. Staunton followed, and they kept up an animated brisk conversation about sundry things. They went down to dinner together; but the round table and the size of the party made all conversation general then. Mrs. Wentworth's cook, who had been bribed by extra high pay to bury his talents in the country, for he said he liked spending the season in London every year, had condescended \"to do his best;\" con sequently, three, at least, of the party, in their fuU appreciation of his skill, showed theh satisfaction by being doubly agreeable. Sir Frederic's first stiff ness thawed, and his countenance became animated ; Dr. EdgehiU expressed his approval in a manner full of benevolent authority, to his niece, the little Lady Frederic, which brought upon him a few of her troubles concerning cooks, &c. ; and while, per haps, the worst dinner would not have quenched the play and brilliancy of Mr. Vaughan's manner when in pleasant company, he did not scruple to own that he liked a well appointed table and delicate cookery. The conversation was brisk, but Mrs. Wentworth would not allow it to Unger on any one subject so as to bring up hot argument or become heavy and prosing. With wonderful tact she shifted the scenes, catching at a word here and there, which, as it were, led into bye lanes and picturesque regions, instead of plodding on the beaten high road. When the ladies retired to the drawhig-room,"], [112, "104 UPS AND DOWNS. Mrs. Wentworth, after one or two rather forced civil speeches to Mrs. Edgehill, who in her turn was, EUen thought, just a little grave and cold, carried off Lady Frederic de Lisle to look at a certain set of cameos and an improved kind of dressing table, which in her new furnishing her house she urged on the young matron's attention. EUen was never sorry to have Mrs. EdgehiU all to herself, and she did not fail to say so ; adding a remark that there were fewer visits between the Rectory and Blair than there used to be or should be. Mrs. EdgehiU sighed and looked graver, and then remarked on the great improvement in her room. \" How much new furniture and a little new arrangement changes a room ! It is perfect now.\" \" Yes ; it is completely refurnished ; and don't you see they have taken in the httle ante-room which forms that delicious deep recess ?

Her face expressed a great deal ; but what, Mrs. Edgehill could not quite understand. She almost thought there was some degree of scorn in the curl of the lip. \"How tremendously hard working some of the young clergy are,\" remarked Mr. Vaughan. \" Yes ; my idea of a curate is a lean, poor-looking creature, \u2014 rushing here and there, breathless, with his"], [119, "A DRIVE AND A DRAWING-ROOM LECTURE.

And over this \u2014 her one cherished and idolized dream, shadows already stole in. It had been thought and said that, when once at Blair, Ellen would entirely fall into Mrs. Wentworth's lead and teaching: that, loving and admiring her as she did, she would be blind to all faults, and follow her in everything. But already there was a consciousness that certain words and opinions almost shocked her. The tone of conversation this very evening had troubled her much. When beyond the reach of opposition from those she did not like, her own natural and acquired principles came out stronger; and since there was no one there to provoke her into opposition, she often lamented certain things, and now and then went so far as to doubt whether it was not her duty to protest, and try to lead her friend. This was not the first time she had felt a presentiment that her life at Blair would not always be smooth \u2014 that she should be called upon to displease one she loved so wildly, or give up what she believed to be right. She had always admired Dr. Edgehill, and liked his gentlemanly, paternal manner. But to night she wished he was more earnest \u2014 less yield ing. She believed that he might, if he would, gain great influence with Mrs. Wentworth. She liked him, and had long known him. If he would but speak out the truth in love.

And even if Ellen set herself the task, always to keep it in view, and to allow no possible opportunities to pass, what could she, so much younger \u2014 so faulty too, ever hope to achieve? Then she remembered that however great, or however little the amount might be, she was bound to do all she could. Perhaps in time, her own practice and loving words might tell a little. Involuntarily her head was raised, and her eyes became deeper and brighter, as her position rose clearly before her. To such a disposition, the sense of responsibility quickened all her energy and courage. She mused long upon it, and before she lay her head on the pUlow, she said to herself, \" So after all, it will not be an easy, luxurious life, worshipping and loving ! Difficulty, and pain, and disappointment stare me in the face. In coming here I have but changed my trials: \u2014 am I ready ? \" This last thought suggested many others, and Ellen awoke tlie next day with a keener sense of her own short-comings, a higher reverence for her sister Bessie's ruhng principle, and with far more earnest, if less bright ideas of life, than she had felt for a very long time."], [123, "115 CHAPTER IX. RECOGNITION. Blair was a gay house. Mrs. Wentworth kept up an almost constant succession of visitors, and she also accepted every invitation, attended the archety and cricket meetings, patronised concerts and balls, and was more than ever courted and admired by all, \u2014 but a few. EUen enjoyed it very much; but she could not shut her eyes to her friend's faults.

For a fortnight after meeting him and Granville Mortimer on the common, she had been some what restless and expectant ; but no visitor or even card appeared; and at last she heard from Mr. V aughan that he was gone. Ellen was disappointed ; after what had passed in London, she had, more than slifi quite knew till it was decided, hoped he would venture on a visit to Blair. Mrs. Wentworth said that it was not her place to call first on Mrs. Damer. They had lately come to the neighbourhood, it was true : but so had she. They were there when she returned from Italy ; and when some one suggested that it was Mrs. Went worth's place, as being the greater person, to call on the vicar's wife, she answered \" that the vicar's lady was an Honourable,\" and there the matter rested. Ellen hoped she might some day be so fortunate as to meet the Damers at a dinner party ; but July was here, and she was still disappointed.

But, my dear, don't you upset the peace of my house in your laudable desire to do good.

What is the use of worrying yourseU about it? And I assure you, Watkins is quite jealous already.

Now, my dear, cheer up ! I '11 enquire, and if Anne really has not time for leisure on a Sunday, she shall have help. There now ! After lunch we will go to Mrs. Legard with the fruit: a work of charity, to please you. And you understand that we are to go to Thorn HUl on Friday?\" When the hour arrived, Mrs. Wentworth found herself unable to drive, being detained by a large party of visitors \u2014 people she wished to see. So Ellen drove herself, and determined to make the most of her independence, by dismissing the pony carriage, and having a chat with Mrs. Legard. The Oaks was only a pleasant walk from Blair, but Ellen did not often take it. She was aware, with out spoken words, that her friend was never pleased to find her seeking any other. She showed no petty jealousy or rivalry when gentlemen paid Ellen the"], [128, "120 UPS AND DOWNS. attention due to her youth and beauty. Perhaps she felt too sure of her own powers to fear another, even one so much younger. At all events she was pleased at all the admiration and notice bestowed on Ellen, and encouraged it; but any approach to intimacy with a lady, brought a shadow on her face : and Ellen hardly understood whether it most vexed her or gave pleasure, as showing that her own love and devotion was a need \u2014 a jealously guarded treasure in Mrs. Wentworth's estimation. Even Miss Moore's most innocent, matter-of-fact letters always brought a touch of annoyance to Mrs. Wentworth's voice, till EUen let her read them; and then the smile returned, as she remarked \u2014 \" I am curious to see her. She must be a dry little \u2014 I am sure she is small \u2014 body. Very amusing, I dare say ; and, but that she has not the conceit, she is not unlike the Mortimer style, as I remember them.\" But this Ellen would not allow. This was not Ellen's first visit to the suffering Mrs. Legard. She had been several times there, and each visit strengthened the wish to go again. It was altogether a new experience to EUen. She had almost as great a horror at suffering, deformity, or disease as Mrs. Wentworth. And Mrs. Legard was quite blind, besides suffering acutely from some dreadful complaint, which must, sooner or later, destroy life. She was quite a cripple, and had not even free use of her hands. Ellen looked on her"], [129, "RECOGNITION. 121 with awe and wonder; but she could not echo Mrs. Wentworth's remark after their first interview : \" I would do anything I could in the way of sending her delicacies, but really I can't stand seehig her often. It is too shocking ! \u2014 too dreadful ! I can't get it out of my head and sight. It unfits me for life ; it would soon make me insane ! \" To Ellen it opened the door for new ideas and thoughts. The very spectacle of such suffering in one so apparently good and gentle, raised a new train of feelings. Her own worries and trials sank* in comparison, till she almost believed she must have invented or exaggerated them. What was it that kept up Mrs. Legard, not only to a meek and quiet submission, but raised and elevated her, so that she had large and lively sympathy for all, a great and most unbounded charity, and a store of brave and fervent hope, which it seemed out of the power of anything to touch ? It made her think of Bessie, and compare the two. She confessed that with all her love for her sister, and her full persuasion that Bessie was better than herself, more amiable, more patient, and more loving, \u2014 there lurked at the bottom a feeling that it was partly owing to Bessie's weaker character : that if she felt and thought as Ellen did, she would be different. Half uncon sciously, there had been a seeling that Bessie was in some way inferior; although under pressure of trial, she would have been glad to lay hold of"], [130, "122 UPS AND DOWNS. Bessie's support, and felt that Bessie's very meek ness had given her strength, which she herself lacked. Now, in Mrs. Legard, there was all the sub mission, and all the meek faith and gentleness, with a naturally high-toned, energetic, superior mind. Ellen at once felt herself inferior to her in all things ; and little sentences, \u2014 chance words dropped by Mrs. Legard, took root in EUen's mind, and returned again and again with startling power. There was a great mixture of feehng \u2014 a great struggle, in fact \u2014 in Ellen's mind at this season. Enjoying her present life to the full, there were moments of mtense depression. Not the miserable, worried, defiant state she often was in at Poole, but a sad realizing of that truth, which sooner or later all must learn, \u2014 that aU is vanity \u2014 that her most cherished idol was, after all, wood and stone ! Then came a tormenting anxiety for the being she so dearly loved and so fervently admired. Each sign of fault or weakness which she learnt to see in Mrs. Wentworth, pained her inmost heart. It made her aU the more eager to uphold and defend her to others. Far from loving her less, the feeling was increased tenfold. She almost looked on her as her child, with a mother's pity and love. The more she saw wrong, the more did she in her heart devote herself to her service ; feeling that chivalrous love, which, in proportion as the world neglected,"], [131, "RECOGNITION. 123 would do battle for her, and shield her from the consequences of her own sins. When she was saddest, and felt keenly that things were not right, she also felt most drawn towards this new friend; for such she began to consider Mrs. Legard. And although the very knowing her served to open her eyes to Mrs. Wentworth's faults, she was impelled to go on. She dared not consider whither it would lead : on she must go ! There was a new call for ever sounding in her heart, and a hand beckoning her on. On ! Where ? \u2014 Ellen did not know ! but life seemed different; and surrounded, as she was, by all she had once most desired and valued \u2014 all that money, and taste, and refinement could give; with admiring eyes and gentle words of flattery for her wherever she was, instead of sneers and cold looks \u2014 in all these gay and glittering scenes, strange and solemn thoughts were in her heart. Could even GranvUle Mortimer have read the writing there, he might have been content: at least so far that there was no longer any undue blindness to Mrs. Wentworth's faults; but he did not \u2014 human hearts are but seldom fairly and really open to each other. It had been agreed that Mrs. Wentworth and Ellen should be at Thorn HiU a day or two before Mr. Vaughan's other guests. He received them with the beaming, merry welcome of a schoolboy ; and apologised for having settled without their"], [132, "124 UPS AND DOWNS. leave to take them into Colminster, on the very first evening, to attend a concert, which he had been persuaded to patronise, and which bid fair to be very tolerable he hoped. Ellen was in high spirits, enjoying the \" fun of the thing,\" as she said; and as they rolled swiftly over the seven miles of road, in Mr. Vaughan's light carriage with four horses, she made a comparison or two in her own mind between this concert and the last she had attended at Poole. They found the room well filled, and that many of the country famihes were present. Seats had been reserved for the Thorn Hill party ; and thither Mr. Vaughan somewhat proudly conveyed Ellen, leaving Mrs. Wentworth to the care of Sir Frederic de Lisle. As he heard the low buzz of evident admiration bestowed on his charge, he glanced up at her bright and pleasant countenance. Then he grew grave, and more silent; and in his voice, when he did speak, there was a tone of suppressed feeling, almost of sadness. Ellen thought he disliked the crowd, and she rallied him playfully on the music he had brought them to hear, when the concert was opened by a long and dull performance on the piano forte. This was followed by a Signora \u2014 something, whose occasional false notes and unfortunate appear ance, brought many a quizzing remark and joke from Mrs. Wentworth. \" Who comes next ? Oh ! Signor Arturelli.\""], [133, "RECOGNITION. 125 \" I understand he is a wonderful singer when \u2014 he chooses \u2014 but that he won't sing to empty benches,\" remarked Sir Frederic. \" It is dreadful being placed here in front facing the people, isn't it Lena? for one dares not laugh : and really, if it is all like what we have had, it is difficult to keep grave ! But, hush, here he is ! \u2014 why ! \u2014 surely I have seen him somewhere! I am sure I have seen him !\" repeated Mrs. Wentworth, with energy. \" Arturelli ! \u2014 I don't know the name ! \u2014 Yet An ill-looking fellow, isn't he, Ellen? Where have I seen that eye ? \" she added, turning to her. \" My dear ! what is the matter ? Are you ill ? She is going to faint, I do believe, Edward !\" \"No,\" said Ellen, with a great effort, and the color now flushing back which had for a moment faded ; \" No ! I never faint. Don't mind \u2014 it is nothing.\" \" It must be the gas. The room is hot,\" Mrs. Wentworth said, giving her a scent bottle. Mean while Mr. Vaughan passed over to Ellen's side and whispered, \" Try to compose yourself. Does she know anything?\" \" No, nothing.\" \"If you can manage to wait till this song is over, I can easily get you out then, and call the carriage !\" She did not answer, but kept her eyes fixed on her bouquet. He remained by her side quietly, not appearing to watch her, but really observing her narrowly."], [134, "126 UPS AND DOWNS. The song was encored. It was very beautiful ! Mrs. Wentworth, being satisfied with Ellen's repUes and her calm, though pale look, gave utterance to her delight at the singing and the extreme and unusual beauty of the man's voice. Mr. Vaughan answered her, and managed completely to screen Ellen and allow her to be silent. She could not but be grate ful for his skill and tact, and even more for the peculiar gentle kindness, betrayed in his voice and manner as much as in what he said. Again he asked if she wished to go. \" No ! I can stay,\" was the low answer. \" I think it is wiser to do so if you can,\" he replied; \" your moving might cause remarks.\" Twice more the Signor sang, and each time every voice was hushed and every eye fixed in intense attention. And Ellen shuddered as the tones of that well remembered voice rang in her ears ! It carried her back to her school-days, and then to Hetty and Ruth. She was intensely glad when all was over. It seemed like some frightful dream, when she found herself agian in the carriage, refreshed by the cool night air. She had to rally herself, and to remember that after all there was nothing very surprising in meeting him at a concert \u2014 But why had he changed his name? Yet, it was so utterly improbable that he had observed her in that crowd, that it was folly to dwell on it. She might never meet him again, or even"], [135, "RECOGNITION. 127 hear of him ; though the sight of that scowl renewed the impression it had left on her mind when she last saw him. She exerted all her courage to enter into the remarks and light talk which followed their return home. But Mrs. Wentworth insisted on her going to bed, saying that the crowded room and the gas had affected her."], [136, "128 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER X. ELECTIONEERING. Me. Vaughan's bride-niece and her husband, with his friend Colonel Sharpe, duly arrived, bringing with them something of a flutter and stir \u2014 and a great quantity of luggage, the inconvenience of which formed the subject for the first half hour's conversation. The young wife pouting, and lan guidly appealing to the ladies, if it was possible to come for a month's visit without just a box or two ? and that men were so tiresome ! \u2014 \" They expected one to be always well dressed, and so forth \u2014 and yet \u2014 how were dresses to be conveyed, if not in trunks?\" \u2014 and a great deal more \u2014 at wdiich her uncle smiled brightly, and pitied married men : declaring that the true philosophy of life was to travel with one small hand-bag ! The husband said he was beginning to understand some of the troubles matrimonial, and told anecdotes of his battles with German and French postillions about the said lug gage ; adding \u2014 however, that the worst part of the whole was certainly that very disagreeable"], [137, "ELECTIONEERING. 129 necessity, a \"lady's maid.\" Meanwhile Colonel Sharpe smiled sardonically behind his huge sandy moustaches, and gave sundry under, but keen, glances towards Ellen ; who, on her part, was settling him in her own mind, to be an extremely ill favoured, unpleasant-looking man, and wondered how \" Worthy \" could smile so prettily and graciously on him. Colonel Sharpe was one of those men who do well to cultivate a large crop of hair. It allows some room for doubt whether it is \" the whiskers or the beard that give him such a ferocious almost ruffianly look,\" one certainly beyond the power of hair to disfigure \u2014 a look from which children instinctively turn; not only plain in feature, but utterly repul sive in expression. Yet fashion, and a certain assumption of self-confidence, made him sought after, and young ladies coloured up with the honour he conferred by talking to them, and asking them to dance. None but the party in the house sat down to dinner on the first day. Mrs. Wentworth considered this a mistake : she thought no one thing such a bore, as a half and half family party. She would most certainly have brought some one or two pleasant people, just to break through the stiffness of the \" settling in.\" But Mr. Vaughan had his own notions, and though he had but little opportunity of en couraging the feeling in his solitary life, he indulged vol. h. K"], [138, "130 UPS AND DOWNS. in a strong fancy for all home and household ties. His orphan niece constituted all his \"family.\" He was heart-glad to see her now, and he wished for no stranger to meddle with tins first welcome to her as a married woman. He placed her at the top of his table, and while exerting himself to be agreeable to Mrs. Wentworth, his glances at Mrs. NevUe were frequent, and full of affectionate anxiety and gratified pride. Ellen liked to watch him, and rather wondered that there was not more warmth in her old schoolfellow's reception of her uncle's marks of love. When the ladies retired, after a slight attempt on Ellen's side to keep up conversation, they were all three inclined to rest, and be silent and dull. Ellen found a review which interested her, while the other two ladies seemed A-ery like dosing, buried each in a lounging chair. But soon, quick and heavy steps and a buzz of voices roused them, the door flew open with a sudden spring, and Mr. Vaughan, unmindful of his guests, entered first, with an eager and excited expression. He had a large paper in his hand : the other gentlemen were also full of something important. \"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Wentworth, sleepily. \" You all look as if some great thing had come to pass.\" Mr. Vaughan smiled. \"Not very great \u2014 yet. important : at least to me. It is a requisition for"], [139, "ELECTIONEERING. 131 me to stand for Colminster. What do you say to it?\" There was a waking up immediately. \" Oh, uncle ! charming !\u2014 What colour will you have? AnM.P. ! . How delightful ! \" \" The very thing for you.\" \" Excellent.\" \" Of course you wdl accept,\" was heard on all sides. \" What becomes of my quiet life ? \" he sighed with comic horror. \" No ! can't stand it. Told them before, it was out of the question. Consider the bore of an election ! \" There was presently a great deal of talking, each one giving excellent reasons why Mr. Vaughan was exactly cut out for a member. The Colonel was laying down the law, and also telling Mrs. Went worth how it came to pass he had not himself entered Parliament During this buzz, Mr. Vaughan got quietly round by Ellen. \" What do you say ? \" he half whispered. \" I ! how can you doubt ! \" \u2014 she spoke eagerly \u2014 \" What a field men have ! Scope for energy, ability, and usefulness.\" \" But all have not energy or ability : I have not courage, I fear, for the necessary work and labour ; and I shouldn't wish to be a mere cipher \u2014 a muff. At least,\" he added, after a pause, and looking at the carpet, \" I can't stand alone \u2014 one needs help, sympathy.\" K 2"], [140, "132 UPS AND DOWNS. \" But you will have sympathy,\" she said. \" From you ? \" and he raised his eyes suddenly to her face with an expression which brought a bright colour on it. Dropping her eyes, she said, quietly, \" Certainly. Why not ? But \u2014 I know nothing of politics.\" And she added, with her former eager ness, and again looking at him, \" I only know I like to see a man stand in his right place, and work ; not dream life away. And were I a man \" \" You despise the life of a country gentleman, then \u2014 the jogtrot peaceful round \u2014 caring for one's neighbours and labourers, and attending the magis trates' board, &c, &c. ? \" \" I don't know. Yet surely some men can, and therefore ought to attempt more than that. What better \u2014 what more honourable, glorious position can there be than this offered you? Such a proud one \" She checked herself suddenly, and began to play with her bracelet. He watched her face intently for a moment, and then moved away : when next questioned by Captain Nevde, he an swered, without hesitation and heartily, that he meant to say, \" Yes.\" From that hour there was no lack of excite ment : all was busy bustle and gaiety. There was just enough contest to give a pleasant zest to the aff ah-. The ladies made up blue and white bows, and embroidered banners, and arranged parties and balls"], [141, "ELECTIONEERING. 133 Sometimes they accompanied Mr. Vaughan in his canvassing visits. Mrs. Wentworth promised to remain till it was over and the great ball well past. Each day at dinner there was some droll story to relate, and generally some success to rejoice over. Mr. Vaughan was well suited to the part he had to play, and was apparently very popular ; never did the fascination of his character show more : so gay, so young, and so gracious, with the added charm of some experience; the mellow perfection that some times comes to a man in his prime, when the rawness and crudeness of youth is sobered down whUe its brightness and enthusiasm is left. Yet in all this gaiety and all this excitement, at times Ellen observed that he was grave \u2014 almost sad. It was as if there was some disappointment somewhere. She ventured to touch on it one even ing, when, as it chanced, he and she found themselves apart from the rest in the conservatory. \" No,\" he answered her : \" now I am fairly launched, I don't look back. No ; all my heart is in it, and I really hope to put my hand to the helm and no longer be the miserable, useless creature I have been. But I reckon on my friends' support. Remember, Ellen, it was a compact ! I shaU claim your sym pathy.\" \" Yes ; we shall be so interested now in the papers ! I shall have to read the debates to Worthy. I wonder how you will speak ! \""], [142, "134 UPS AND DOWNS. \" There is plenty of work to be done without being an orator.\" His eyes wandered as he spoke to where his niece was sitting, dressed in elaborately fashionable style, and surrounded by several gentle men; foremost in attention, and sitting by her side, was the Colonel. Mr. Vaughan sighed. \" I fear,\" he remarked, presently : \" Ellen ! do you observe it, or is it my fancy born of an anxious mind ? But I do sometimes wish Letty was not so \u2014 so \u2014 worldly \u2014 or so fine a lady. I can scarcely recognise the little warm frank ghi I first took to Mrs. Harding's. What do you think ? \" \" What did you expect ? \" returned EUen, gently. \" She was solely brought up by Mrs. Harding, wasn't she ? \" \"Yes; I had no female relation, and I heard so much of Mrs. Harding's care: she seemed so kind too. Do you consider her teaching wrong? You were there : how is it, you are not the merely fine lady of fashion that my Letty is ? \" \"Perhaps troubles saved me from that,\" she answered, shortly ; \" and early teaching,\" she added, softly. \" But how can it be otherwise than that Mrs. Harding's pupds be worldly ? I confess I don't see.\" \" She is not what I imagined \u2014 what I wished. My Letty is gone ! perhaps it is my own fault. I led her into the whirlpool, beheving it all right."], [143, "ELECTIONEERING. 135 But, of late, I have seen things differently : my former life, and its aims, seem to me now very frivolous, very despicable. But, good heavens ! what can Nevile be made of to leave his wife so much \u2014 so entirely to that fellow ? \" \"Can he help it?\" \" Help it ! of course ! If a man can't protect and shield his wife from such \u2014 such wholly unde sirable attentions, what is he good for ? \" \" Was there great attachment between your niece and Captain NevUe ? \" \"Pretty fair; I can't suppose anything very deep. They liked each other, I believe.

Why, I fancied myself in love at least a dozen times; and yet I am very sure I never felt it \u2014 never till No ! a very young man, with a few exceptions, does not love.\" \" And pray what age do you assign as the age ? \" \"Not a month younger than thirty,\" he said, fixing his eyes on her, in a curious way ; half fun, and half earnest, and with a sweet, tender smde just curling his lips. \"I don't agree with you,\" she said, decidedly,"], [144, "136 UPS AND DOWNS. turning to examine a plant; and Mrs. Wentworth coming in, the tete-a-tete was broken up. The rest of the party were strolling about the lawn, chatting of the morrow, the polling-day, and looking up between times at the pure, pearly sky, and the radiant brightness of Venus, as she followed the sun's path \"to hed,\" as Colonel Sharpe said with his half suppressed laugh, turning every subject to common-place fun, or rather slang. \" Well, 'pon my word, Vaughan, I don't quite wonder at your doubts at first. This is a perfect place ; aud if you kept a pack of harriers, and pre served your game well, a fellow couldn't desire a better place : I don't wonder at your not being anxious to be bothered with those cursed dry politics,\" exclaimed Captain Nevile. \" Whatever my coward doubts were, they have vanished. I begin to wish to ' live : ' to be of some use.\" \" Oh, you can be plenty of use here, as to that ; however, I am not wanting to discourage you. As I said before, it is the right thing, and will of course establish you at once in a position, and all that. What do you say, Letty ? \" turning round to his wife, who was teaching a gentleman guest the language of certain flowers, and coquet ting furiously. \" 'Twouldn't be altogether a bad thing if I beat up the bush some future day for Coldtown: eh, my little lady?

Do try, George dear,\" and she turned again to her companion, and offered him a sprig of verbena, with a channing, saucy smde. EUen watched her, and felt why her uncle was grave and sad in his thoughts of her. How frivo lous, how objectionable aU this flirtation and courting admiration seemed to EUen ! And yet had she not earned herseU such a name and reputation? The party that evening did not please her. She more and more disliked Colonel Sharpe ; and it was almost come to open warfare between them.

And what was so very vexing in it was that \u2022'\u25a0' Worthy'\" liked it, accepted it : and smded, and made herself agreeable to the \u2022\"\u2022\"odious man.\""], [146, "138 UPS AND DOWNS. Many of these thoughts stole over her this evening. She did not know why, but it was an effort to her to talk and attend. She felt something of her old Poole irritation and disgust : her old strong contempt for others. The world and its inhabitants seemed all mockery, all vanity. Dis appointment lurked in everything. Every one disappointed her : yes, even Mr. Vaughan. He was most perplexing of all : she was constantly trapped, as it were, into sudden, warm liking for him, and admiration of his sunny, pleasant nature ; but then, just as she felt interested about him, and thought she had reached something in him on which she could rest and return, it vanished. \" Quick silver\" was a good name. His disposition was so versatile, so changeful \u2014 at one moment up, and at the next down : \u2014 one moment all energy, and life and animation ; then blank, languid, and lazy, as if it was all too much trouble. So haU encouraging and half suppressing these ideas as they passed in some confusion through her mind, she wandered on grave and pre-occupied ; giving a mechanical answer now and then to a very yToung gentleman who foUowed her, and tried hard to show himself a \" man of the world,\" or a \" fast fellow.\" She longed to be alone, to look up at that beauti ful sky, so pure, so calm, so deep in its chastened colouring. It was a quiet, still, most lovely evening, and the long shadows on the mossy grass, and"], [147, "ELECTIONEERING. 139 the faint odour of flowers in the faUing dew, suited well with the distant peep of the river, and the barge which moved so slowly and lazily along. No sound but the people's voices on the lawn, the soft whisper among the leaves, and a distant sheep bell. But, though not alone and able to indulge in any dreaming so natural to the hour and the scene, an undefined thought came which sent the blood faster to her heart \u2014 the outline of a character, different to Mr. Vaughan, different from all here ; one not suited to gay company ; but thoughtful, calm, and earnest \u2014 even stern at times : one to whom gay and pleasant words did not come easily at the call of every stranger, but to whom the single presence of one he liked inspired beautiful ideas, and whose words had power to carry his hearer away from common things to the region of poetry and fancy: at least he was all this once, long ago. What he might have become now, she knew not. Certainly to her he was changed. \" Mightn't one suppose, without any great play of fancy, that Miss Raymond's thoughts were very far from us all \u2014 away, where we can't guess ! \u2014 eh, Mrs. Wentworth ? \" said the Colonel, in his harsh, satirical voice. Ellen frowned; but Mrs. Wentworth laughed, and bid a penny for her thoughts. Was she thinking of defeat to-morrow ? \"Ah! How could I be so very stupid? Of course, there can't be a doubt where the fair lady's"], [148, "140 UPS AND DOWNS. thoughts are ! Don't grieve, Miss Raymond ; your friend is safe. But he should be aware \u2014 I hope he is \u2014 how kindly you sympathise with him in this hour of excitement. Vaughan!\" he said, with a sneer in his tone \u2014 \" you ought to be all grati tude to have such \u2014 such flattery, such perfect sympathy.\" \" To be sure,\" Mr. Vaughan answered with ready frankness, which took off the rough edge of the Colonel's inuendoes : \" to be sure. I claim it as a right, though ; I would not have entered the lists but for the promised sympathy of these three ladies. I know they are all feeling very ' all-overish' this evening. It would be awkward to be beaten ; wouldn't it?\" But Ellen had turned directly to her constant companion, young Mr. Norris, and suddenly plunged into a series of questions about his racer and his steeple-chase : rather to his surprise, as all the time he had been telling her wonderful facts concerning them, she had scarcely seemed to hear him. But her smile and evident desire to please recalled his waning admiration. They were soon flirting nearly as much as any one else ; at last Mr. Norris was wanted by some gentlemen to decide a disputed point about a hunter, a subject he was thoroughly \"up\" in, and Ellen was left standing by the rosebush from which the two had been gathering flowers ; she"], [149, "ELECTIONEERING. 141 having presented him with one which he stuck in his button-hole, with an ah of delight and tri umph.

I believe I have a little of the feeUng in my nature : at least I had when I was very young, and very happy,\" and she sighed. He did not speak directly. And soon she turned round to join the others, remembering the Colonel's sneer. \" It is a dangerous resort \u2014 a bad way*\" of venting anger or happiness,\" at last he said, in more of his usual light and playful manner, but with something earnest in it too. \" Yes ; very dangerous,\" she repeated. \" Mr. Vaughan, I would give much if I had never, never indulged in it. It has cost me bitterly.\" \" Has it ? Ah \u2014 yes ! I heard \u2014 Mrs. Wentworth told me a little of the horrible gossip, and scandal, and ill-nature. But that is past. I hope all that is over ! There will be alike no cause, and no wish for that way of showing anger or resentment in future.\" \" Perhaps not. But I don't know,\" she said, with a sigh. \" Who is that?\" she asked, presently, as two people appeared for a moment in the \" dark walk,\" as it was called : that is, a very shaded, over-grown path, leading to what was once a grotto, and skirting the lawn on one side. \" It is Letty and that Colonel ! \" he said, at the same time leaving EUen, and walking rapidly to wards them. Nor did he return to her.

CHAPTER XI. PAYING AN OLD DEBT. It was a very fine dayT \u2014 bright and hot. The party were in high spirits, and the blue and white badges, and the ladies' tasteful scarfs and ribbons on pure white muslin dresses, and the four spanking greys with streamers, looked very brilliant. Colminster was alive. Shops were flaunting with blue and white, or orange and purple. Banners and bands, and dirty shouting boys, and gaping women filled the streets, ready for any stir. An election, in all its accompanying circumstances, is pretty much alike everywhere. Too stale to be dwelt on, even cursorily; though, perhaps, many a bit of racy and genuine life is to be found in the bawling, shouting crowd \u2014 many a bit of quiet principle and courage may reward the searcher, among all the bravado, the trickery, and the common-place noise and ex citement. Mrs. Wentworth's taste peeped out in all the arrangements surrounding Mr. Vaughan : at least, so far as a woman's hand and taste could reach. His"], [153, "PAYING AN OLD DEBT. 145 appearance was hailed at first with great greeting and welcome. As EUen observed, all the woman kind seemed taken by their elegant equipage. \" No; oh, no,\" said Captain Nevile. \" It is all Vaughan. Ke looks such a hero in his lemon gloves, and is so very polite, and snuling, and all that ! \" The ladies were accommodated in the best parlour of the principal inn, leading out on the balcony; from whence could be seen the vehicles laden with voters, and in fact all the fun. It was very exciting, the gentlemen running in every now and then with the poll figures. \u2014 At first, very delightful, as well as exciting, for Vaughan kept ahead. Then came a turn. The rival candidate, Mr. Glynn, or a par tisan, managed to get up a party cry which roused the mob, and the messenger looked grave, saying that \" Glynn \" was fast getting up to them. Again there was a change ; but only for a time. The noise increased. Placards, and banners, and music were added, and the cry that tickled the people was reiterated ; while hot and eager partisans hurried to and fro frantic with the excitement. \" I advise you ladies to go back,\" said Captain Nevile. \" Order out the carriage and drive home now at once \u2014 before \" \"Before it is known? before the triumph \u2014 the, chairing? No! No! No!\" was exclaimed. \"Before the defeat!\" he said. \"It is a horrid shame \u2014 a cursed job ; but he is sure to lose. All vol. n.

It wdl kUl her, if there's any fuss.\" \" Defeat ! \" exclaimed Ellen. \" I thought he was sure ! How is it ? And wdl it be right \u2014 kind, I mean, to desert?\" \"He told me to order the carriage, and beg you all to return. We shall follow as soon as we can. Pray, go.\" Captain Nevile spoke hi a tone of command, and looked too irritable to bear any further questioning ; so there was no more to be said. The carriage was ready at the door ; the greys looking impatient, and tossing theh streamers ; and then, as a loud yell and a voUey of hisses arose at the sight of the colours, they reared and jumped, and it was quite as much as the coachman could do to restrain them. Ellen's eyes were doubly bright. The whole thing stirred her \u2014 especially since there was a talk of defeat. How she longed to be a man, to go and talk to all those senseless, screaming, ragged crea- tures. How she would work and fight, reason and persuade ! She thought of ancient orators, and of a modern one, too, who had lately held a blood-thirsty and disturbed mob for hours, under the speU of his voice, and succeeded in restraining them from bloodshed by his words and strong appeal. She did not like the turning away and leaving it all : she"], [155, "PAYING AN OLD DEBT. 147 would have braved any danger, could she but have been in the battle. When they reached Thorn House, and the others retired to rest, in order, as they said, that they might be fresh to receive the poor tired-out men on their return, EUen was excited and restless. She could not sit still, or settle to any employment. Letters awaited them ; and there was one from Lily Day, which she carried out to enjoy under the shade of a spreading walnut. She was impatient at the confinement of the rooms, and longed for air and the bright warm sunshine. After the first reading, Ellen went back more than once to certahi parts of this letter. \" Tdl I grow much stronger, my aunt has found some work for me to do at home, which does not tire me at all. I get well paid, and I have all my evenings for myself. I am learning hard at French, in which Mr. GranvUle is so very good as to assist me. He assures me it is quite necessary to know it, if I persist in being a teacher \u2014 and what could I do else, dear Miss Ellen ? I don't luke the notion of service or constant needlework. I love reading more and more, I think; and Mr. G. lends me nice books, and when they are hard for me to understand, he explains them. And he makes me tell him all the books I have read with you ; and he looked at your marks and notes, and such a pleasant smile came slowdy over his whole face, as he looked ! He is very sdent, but he just puts L 2"], [156, "148 UPS AND DOWNS. in a word and asks a question, and gets me upon those happy, happy hours \u2014 past, I fear, for ever ! And he listens kindly, and I am learning not to be so much in fear of him, for all his stately carriage. Sometimes, when I think surely I am running on too free! and stop, he looks up so eager and so kind, and says, 'Well?' or 'Goon.' And what do you think? Please, dear Miss Ellen, don't be offended; but it goes to my heart, and is the highest compliment I ever had : he says I remind him of you \u2014 of your own self \u2014 now and then! Think of that ! But, of course, I am not so silly and vain as to believe it.\" EUen was still lingering under the walnut-tree, and musing about many things ; soothed out of elec tion excitement by the memories Lily's letter had awakened, and by the bees' continual murmur, as they clustered round the well-stocked flower-beds. Then she heard the sound of wheels, and soon caught sight of a carriage driving quickly up the road. She ran in, and found the other ladies, refreshed and ready in dinner costume to receive the party. There was not much suspense. The very first look at Captain Nevile spoke of defeat. \" Precious affair ! Confounded blackguardism ! Wretched fellows ! Coidd hardly fight our way out ; and as it is, we have come in fine plight,\" and he held up his torn coat-tails and pointed to his battered hat. The Colonel came in with Mr. Vaughan. All"], [157, "PAYING AN OLD DEBT. 149 were heated, yet pale \u2014 dusty, and annoyed. Mr. Vaughan's arm was in a sling, and his coat sleeve had been opened up to the shoulder. \" Only a chance stone,\" he said, smiling. \" A cursed blackguard of a foreigner ! I believe he was at the bottom of that confounded cry. I saw and heard him too ! I could swear to him again anywhere,\" cried the Colonel. \" Very thirsty and tiring work,\" remarked Mr. Vaughan, as he laid aside his hat, and pushed back his hair from his forehead. Then he smiled as pleasantly and as gaily as ever, and spoke of the refreshing cool and quiet of home compared with the din there; and foUowing the ladies, as they dejectedly re-entered the drawing-room, he sat himself down between his niece and Ellen on a large sofa \u2014 looked from one to the other, and then held out his hand, (his well hand) to each, declaring, \" This was too good: having women about one made all things easy. It would have been horridly desolate, to return and find no one here. This was just what he liked.\" \" Yes \u2014 we shall see you a Benedict soon, of course,\" said Mr. Mildmay, his proposer and staunch supporter, who had chosen to accompany him home, and condole in the defeat \"Well, I should not say 'No,'\" said Vaughan, laughing. \" My arm ? \" to his niece. \" Oh, it is nothing. Sharp at first: but yet \u2014 yes, I have a"], [158, "150 UPS AND DOWNS. great mind to think it very bad. I should luke to be nursed and made much of, you know. Really, it is painful \u2014 stiff and painful ! \" \" Horrid creature ! \" said Letty. \" Who did it ? \" \" There was a perfect shower of stones and eggs : it is impossible to be sure who,\" he answered, quickly; and then he laughingly described their desperate fight through the mob, and how a woman had caught hold of him. It was the same aU the evening. His spirits never flagged : there was no sourness or ill-humour. He said he should try again next time ; and meanwhile, he should enjoy his leisure at home : and, he added to EUen, im prove the interval in preparing himself more for the responsibility. He hardly deserved to succeed, having led so self-pleasing and indolent a life hitherto. It was just as well as it was. He was full of fun and anecdote ; telling comical stories with inimitable humour, which drew peals of laughter. Yet, after dinner, when Mrs. Wentworth was remarking on his charming elasticity of temper to his niece, Ellen could not help thinking she shoidd better like something quieter, calmer, and cooler. She felt half annoyed at the flush hi his face, and the sparkle of his eye ; which spoke of excitement, and even flurry. His gay temperament and the restless perpetual movement, even his never failing politeness and sweetness, almost worried her into being cold and scornful ; and then she blamed herself"], [159, "PAYING AN OLD DEBT. 151 for ill-temper, and tried to admire him. Why was her taste so peculiar ? Why did she not feel him to be the taking, fascinating person, others did ? Why always, in her own imagination, should another type of character arise ? colder \u2014 harder, outside ; but more dignified, more earnest and stedfast. Was it imagination ? Or was it remembrance ? She had no time to settle the question, which rapidly rose and was put aside, for she was called to the pianoforte to accompany Mrs. Wentworth on the harp. It was a long evening. It seemed as if just because they were all so weary and tired they would not give way, and tried to make up to themselves for the rejoicing they had so reckoned on. Song after song was given; Mrs. Wentworth's superb voice never sounded better, and they wound up with the \"merriest, maddest,\" old glees and rounds; and at last, stepped out into the cool grand night, and with the dark shadow of trees around them, they all joined in the national anthem. Then champagne was caUed for, and then there was more singing, and more tabb ing, and laughing ; and Ellen was very, very tired of it all. She heard with some regret, Mrs. Wentworth accede to Mr. Vaughan's earnest request, that they would not desert him ; but remain to help hhn through a whole series of dinner parties, which must take place : though the ball was at an end. Ellen wished to be at Blah- again, to go and stand at Ashby Cross, and look at her favourite waves; or to visit"], [160, "152 UPS AND DOWNS. Mrs. Legard, or chat with Goody Fleet. She was sick of noise and company, and then wondered if she was growing old and sour. She had a letter at this time from Miss Moore, which gave her some curious subject for speculation. Besides confirming her own anxiety about her sister, there were words and expressions which she thought could only point one way. And it was certainly curious, considering how much she disliked them, that the family of Mortimers should so much occupy her thoughts. Wondering what Miss Mortimer would say and how she would look, and pretty, sdly Rosamond, and the very learned Anne \u2014 and what the fond, timid mother would say: if she would receive another daughter kindly, and if it would suit and fit in \u2014 and how hard, how very bad it would be, to have to put up with sundry family \" ways ; \" and how trying to live so near : and Cecil, the great placid, kindly Cecd, wdth his dry humour and sensible smile, and self-composed, self-satisfied carriage \u2014 how wrould he look and speak in this new character ? He had good taste! only how could Miss Moore like to be a Mortimer \u2014 Mrs. Mortimer of Poole ! What would John say of it ? And would Granville like it, and find a friend and companion in this new sister? She was capable of appreciating hhn and his pursuits, at all events; and Ellen remembered how once the thought had crossed her that he admired Miss Moore very much, and took pains to show it, and"], [161, "PAYING AN OLD DEBT. 153 talked to her more than was common to him. She thought over all this, while she was copying a picture of Mr. Vaughan's : she worked at it when ever she could, trying to turn a deaf and unheed ing ear to all Colonel Sharpe's remarks, which insinuated that it was taking unnecessary trouble to copy when the original wasjliere ! \" It was not hers,\" she sai-x \" Perhaps not now, but \u2014 ahem \u2014 \" and a meaning look and smile made her face crimson, and her brow frowning and angry. When Mr. Vaughan was present, these disagree able allusions fell to the ground. His frankness and friendliness shielded her : he was ahve to spare her from any remark ; though in one way or another he was constantly by her side, claiming her interest and regard as a right, and as far as he could, always coupling her and his niece together, as two young things \u2014 school-fellows, &c."], [162, "154 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XII. A SUNDAY WALE; AND TALK. The spell of hot weather was broken at last. It was a cool, grey morning ; the clouds rapidly gathering with swift subtle motion, as if preparing for work. The leaves of the poplars near the house showed white as they turned in the breeze. EUen noted it all gladly, and rejoiced at the prospect of a com paratively quiet day, for it was Sunday. The vdlage church was nearly a mde and a half away ; and as she knew by experience that there was not much likelihood of the rest of the party caring to go, she was glad of the cooler wTeather, to make her walk less fatiguing. After a late breakfast, there was a little knot of people consulting together at the window, and deciding that it was far too threatening to go to church. Some had letters to write, and a few lingered on in chat, while one or two of the gentlemen started off for a long stretch across the common; intending, they said, to reach a new church three miles off, where a popular preacher officiated. EUen contrived to escape, without notice"], [163, "A SUNDAY WALK AND TALK. 155 or remonstrance ; and much she enjoyed her solitary walk. She liked the bemg alone, and the going to this poor little country church. It reminded her of her childhood, wdien she and Bessie had gone with their mother to the high towered church* at Ashby Cross. She remembered her wonder then why her father never accompanied them. But at Poole, he had been a very regular attendant ; no weather preventing his appearing in his well cushioned pew, looking so entirely the respectable gentleman. And there, often, Ellen remained at home \u2014 out of sorts, scorning remark, yet smarting sorely under it; or when she did go, there was always the annoyance of having to answer the greetings of acquaintance. And the old subject of dispute \u2014 the Sunday-school, in which she ought to have taken her turn as teacher, but never would \u2014 that was a regular Sunday grievance. But now, how free, how peaceful it was ! No one to cavil or scold, no hard and curious looks. If only Worthy would but come too ! if only on this one subject there was more sympathy between them ! Why was it? Her mother was so religious, so earnest in teaching her chddren, and she and Mrs. Wentworth had received the same bringing up in chddhood and ghlhood. Mr. Vaughan, too. Ellen was vexed with him. He sometimes spoke as if he thought of higher duties ; and yet, just because the party in his house made excuses, he joined them ! He was"], [164, "156 UPS AND DOWNS. not firm \u2014 he was so easily led. But her thoughts were broken by the passing of the villagers. The chime of bells was very sweet, and groups of people in hoUday dress stood about under the Lych-gate ofround a tombstone, awaiting the last single bell. EUen lingered also, tiU the clergyman appeared, and the chime subsided to a monotone ; and then the congregation gathered together and went in. An old woman pointed out the squire's seat to EUen. When she arose from her knees, she was somewhat startled to find some one else by her. It was Mr. Vaughan. The sermon was one calculated to make an impres sion. The preacher was very young, almost boyish \u2014 with his fair face and wavy golden hair. But he spoke w-ith the grave earnestness of a man who knew what he undertook when he preached to others. He was persuasive, yet very solemn. The very simphcity of his language, and the composed stillness of his manner, added authority to his words. His voice was clear and good. \" Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it wdth all thy might.\" Very practical it was : he urged the duty of earnestness in every single action, and brought down and applied the words to every condition of life. Then he alluded to the difficulties that lay in the path, and the horror of faUing away, having once put hand to the plough. As he proceeded, he grew warmer, and it was plain that he no longer abided by his"], [165, "A SUNDAY WALK AND TALK. 157 manuscript It was a call to battle : the sound of the trumpet, calling on Christian soldiers to arm to the fight EUen was moved to the core.

Yet that rapid glance seemed to reveal much to Ellen. She felt it was true that he had, as he said once, awoke from dreams to life and work : that he was in earnest. There was a humility in the expression, a leaning on other strength than his own, which touched her keenly, and a sudden accession of respect grew up in her mind. They were in the lane \u2014 side by side. He had spoken a few words to the people and then overtaken her. It was gusty, and every now and then there was a drop or two of rain, but perhaps it would keep off vet ; and meanwhile the lane was pleasant, cool, and fresh, and dry. They were silent for some time. \" Did you walk here alone ? \" he asked. \u00ab Yes \u2014 I thought \u2014 I did not know any one was coming,\" she answered, hesitatingly; for he had often rallied her on her love of independence."], [166, "158 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I always attend this church.

I hope to my heart that Grantley won't fall into any outrageous extravagances, which they accuse Mr. Damer of. At present he is very quiet and well judging in the parish.

He may marry without this, as I may, perhaps, for the comfort and convenience of the thing : a matri monial arrangement, in fact. And he may make a good and kind husband, and do his duty in return for the comfort and sympathy and support a wife must bring.

His voice was husky, and his words rushed out with im pulsive force, which scarcely allowed them to be plain. She glanced at him, and was alarmed at his quivering features and flushed and eager face. Mrs. Wentworth's words and wishes, returned to her. She longed to be away ; for some one to come and break up this conversation. She dreaded his next words; and when they came, her heart almost seemed to stand still with fright. He spoke quite quietly, and the old winning smile was on his lips; though still his eyes sparkled, and his lips trembled a little as well as his hands. \" EUen,\" he said, \" forgive me all this burst of folly. I have a great boon to ask. No; don't turn away ! I 've frightened you, I see.

Yes, directly I said the word ' gaol ' the fellow, I saw, shrank, and cowered, and ceased to bully, or advance his absurd pretensions.

To see his ugly face, how it changed and drooped ! \u2014 after his miserable audacious boasts and assertions, too ! He is a mere swindler and a bold adventurer. You will leave it to me, won't you ? Trust me, EUen ; do ! Please to shake off all those odious little pre judices, which I know surround me in your mind. I have been, I know, a kind of bugbear to you \u2014 involuntarily on my part ; a sort of thorn in your side \u2014 a cause of annoyance \u2014 I know it all ! Be generous \u2014 throw it off, Ellen ! Do me justice, and allow me to be the \u2014 the friend I wish.\" \" You are very kind. Indeed, I am grateful,\" she said, as well she could ; for her fears about Zanelli had upset her. \" Grateful ! That tone too ! Well, for the pre sent, be it so. I will accept it: I can't afford to cast away even your 'gratitude,' EUen. Beggars mustn't be choosers, I suppose.\" He spoke in that joking, light, boyish tone so peculiar to himself. \" Ah, here comes the rain, and turnips will be looking up.

Thank you, once more I This will be a 'white day,' a memorable day, for me. Now, don't mind light words and foolish gossip, or the Colonel's wretched jokes. We under stand one another, and that's enough: we are friends.\" She said \"Yes;\" and met the questioning and amused looks of the home party wdth great com posure ; confessing the pleasant lengthened walk and talk they had had, and maintaining a cool, mimoved face, even beneath Colonel Sharpe's keenest glances and most stinging jokes. The word \"friend\" pleased and charmed her. She liked Mr. Vaughan after all \u2014 now that the lurking dread of him had vanished, which rumour and Mrs. Wentworth had created ; and was truly interested in him, and grate ful to him. Yes, \" friendship \" was delightful ; the very thing she most wished for. Worthy*- would soon see and understand how it was with them. Nothing could be more mistaken than her idea, begotten wholly of her own wdsh. Mr. Vaughan looked on her \u2014 Ellen \u2014 only as a younger sister. He had a warm, affectionate heart which needed quiet, domestic love and sympathy. That was all! Worthy was quite wrong, and would soon see she was so. Yet those few agitated words, which burst forth unawares ! What could they mean ? Perhaps he had loved, and had been disappointed : perhaps he loved some one even now. If so, would he consult"], [175, "A SUNDAY WALK AND TALK. 167 and confide in her ? He was so open, so dependent on others' sympathy, he would hardly keep even that locked up to himself. He would wish for sympathy, where another would court the most complete reserve. And very naturally, he came to her. For Mrs. Wentworth could hardly enter into his fervour, even if her own plans and schemes did not interfere. And as to Letty, Mrs. Nevile ! \u2014 she might listen, but a small child would make a more genial confidante than this young woman of the world \u2014 the London belle ! It was extraordinary how relieved Ellen was, and how immediately she regained the power of enjoy ment. Flattered by the idea of this new friendship, and bringing to it all her romance, her half dormant warmth of heart and her quick fancy*', she felt as if some new charm was thrown on life. She no longer sat in judgment on Mr. Vaughan, or fretted at his youthful ways and exuberance of sphits. She laughed too, and entered into all the fun and aU the gaiety ; secretly amused at Mrs. Wentworth's evident pleasure, mingled with a little surprise, at the change she saw and could not quite account for. All went well now. The duty dinners were enlivened by the ladies' presence. The house lost the look of bachelorhood and state, which, in spite of its comfort and luxury, had pervaded it on their arrival. It looked more like a home, and"], [176, "168 UPS AND DOWNS. Mr. Vaughan keenly appreciated this improvement, and rejoiced over the presence of women, daily; this of course drew down various jokes and hints, which, however, he parried skilfully and gaily. But Colonel Sharpe ceased from his coarse allusions, and observed more : for he could not make it out. Then he tried what he could do on his own account, and for some days he became Ellen's constant attend- ant ; entering with warmth and skill into her pursuit of sketching. But she alway-s received his advances with a cold, formal civility, which he could not break through ; so again he left her for what cost him less trouble. And Mr. Vaughan, who had been somewhat fretful and worried, resumed his good humour ; only indulging now and then in a sotto voce, but fervent abuse of the \" detestable man.\" But the days flowed by, and it was time for the party to separate. The Neviles were engaged to visit their relations in Scotland. Colonel Sharpe had business in town ; though he talked of meeting his friends again on the moors. Mr. Vaughan himself was called away; which he said was very lucky, or the empty house would surely drive him desperate. He rode a good part of the way by Mrs. Wentworth's carriage, on their return home, teaching Ellen the management of the spirited ponies, which it was now her place to drive. He left them at a turn of the road, about three miles from Blair: he raised his hat, reined in his fidgetty"], [177, "A SUNDAY WALK AND TALK. 169 mare, and shouted \"good-bye\" again and again. Then Mrs. Wentworth heaved a long sigh \u2014 of pleasure, it seemed, from the placid smile on her face. She drew her thick veil close round her ; and except to say, \" Pleasant fellow ! he ought to have been elected : even the idea of it, brightened him up. Don't you think he is happier and looking better, Lena ? \" she kept silence for nearly the rest of the way. Ellen's attention was entirely*- devoted to guiding her ponies ; but she looked up to catch the shadow on the deep Abbey Moods, and the gleam on the rest less foaming waves, which were dashing on and off the cliffs \u2014 an emblem of perpetual warfare, as she fancied. And then Mr. Grantley's sermon came into her mind; and as they drove up to the door, she felt : \u2014 \" This is home, and here I am to fight \u2014 to struggle \u2014 to live. Home ! it is a pleasant word ; with home, and a friend \u2014 two friends, no one need be very miserable.\" She threw down the reins and jumped lightly out; in the impulse of the moment, she passed her arm round Mrs. Wentworth, who stood on the steps, speaking to the butler. \" Oh, Worthy, ain't you glad to come home ? How nice it is ! and here comes poor old Ranger to give us welcome,\" she added, as a noble old bloodhound came slowly from his sunny corner, and rubbed his hanging jaws against the lady's rich silk vvith perfect complacency."], [178, "170 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Yes, it is home now ; and alwayrs will be to you, Lena, my darling. But it won't always be the only home, or the dearest,\" and she drew EUen with her to look at her favourite flowers."], [179, "171 CHAPTER XIII. WHO IS HE? Ellen visited Mrs. Legard and Goody Fleet, but found the old woman in such a vicious, spiteful mood, that she was glad to make some excuse for cutting short the interview. \"Aye \u2014 be off! I don't want nobody. Witch, indeed ! easy*- to blacken any one, they senseless bodies ! But there 's none deserve such names, if right was right. I tell 'ee, I don't want 'ee here : it just brings up what I don't want to mind. 'Twasn't long she had the bright gleeful eye you have this minute. You are as like as two peas : and yet you ain't up to her neither : no one ever was ! And then to see her a corpse\u2014 and worse than that, for weeks and weeks; for death in life is worse to see than death itself? And of nights when the thoughts come, I seem crazed most; and because I sit, and think, and think, I am no better than a witch, eh ! No matter ! no matter ! I 'm old. I '11 soon lie beside her. I don't want none of you \u2014 No ! not one ! Ye are all happy and rich, ancl I hate ye all\u2014 all!\""], [180, "172 UPS AND DOWNS. Incoherent mutterings such as these seemed to follow Ellen, as she ran towards the sea. Shocked as she was, Ellen longed very much to be able to understand Goody's allusion. \" Worthy\" had never fulfilled her promise of telling her of those old times of her mother's and aunt's girlhood. They were to be alone this evening: after that there would be company ; so on this very night, she resolved when they were\" cosy\" in the drawing room, or better still in the dressing-room, she would coax Mrs. Wentworth to tell her tale. Ellen returned to be very busy, arranging her drawing things and settling new pictures. First and foremost she must make a day for completing the Abbey sketch. The teasing Colonel Sharpe had done her one service, in at once pointing out in what respect her first drawing of this had failed. She had felt that it was not right, but vainly sought how and where ; now she should begin again, and it was to be her very best picture. These thoughts were disturbed as she reached the house, by seeing Watkins, Mrs. Wentworth's own maid, evidently waiting for her arrival, and with a troubled face. \" If you please, miss, Mrs. Wentworth wishes to see you directly. You will please to be very quiet, for she has been very bad: very bad, indeed!\" \"111? How? When? What caused it ? \" \" That 's more than I can say exactly ; but in my"], [181, "WHO IS HE? 173 opinion 'twas all of seeing a man \u2014 a foreigner, who was here about some concert business, asking my lady's patronage about something. It will never do : I know quite well, this here sort of way of going on will bring her to the grave ! Mrs. Wentworth has nerves, Miss Raymond; more than her share, and can't get on in this dismal place, no way at all. Ever since she came back here, I knew how it would be ! And just to see how well she was in Italy \u2014 oh, dear ! \" Ellen found her friend leaning back in her chair, very pallid and trembling. Her eyes were closed ; and as Ellen came in with noiseless steps she did not hear her, but started and looked up somewhat wildly, as she felt the light touch of her hand. \" Ellen ! EUen ! \u2014 where have you been all this time ? Ah ! take me away, my dear ! I must go ! \u2014 I shall die if I remain in this ill fated place. Let us go away at once !

And \u2014 and \u2014 oh, Ellen, it is strangely dreadful, \u2014 he asked me to have him here,\u2014 in my own house, \u2014 to sing to a party !

Oh, Worthy, what can you mean?\" exclaimed EUen, in distress. \"Who has been here to disturb you, and make you so ill ? \" \" Who ?\u2014 Who ? \" Then lowering her voice to a hollow whisper, she added, \" Who can there be to disturb me now \u2014 save him ? Arturo Vilani \u2014 the Count. Yes ! it was himself ! \u2014 Didn't some thing thrill through me that night at Colminster ? \" (she shivered as she spoke). \"I said I recognised the face ; but little, little guessing the truth, even then ! For he is changed ; much altered \u2014 and no wonder ! So am I. It is years and years ago ! What can he mean by coming here again to sing ? He must be brave or reckless to venture here.\" \" What do you mean ? I can't understand ! It is all mystery ! Is it the man who sang so well ? \u2014 What can you know, Worthy, of him \u2014 of Zanelli ? \" \" Nothing at all.

Send the men to search, and bid them lock the doors and admit no one \u2014 no one,\" she whispered eagerly. Then presently she began again talking incoherently and wildly. \"He married her \u2014 oh, yes, but all her"], [184, "176 UPS AND DOWNS. beauty faded \u2014 and she died ! Yes ; she didn't trouble her ' Count' long ! \u2014 Died ! \u2014 and she was buried in the night. Plumes, and tolling bells, and \u2014 and an oath !

And he is turned singer ! Ellen Raymond's husband, a public singer! Well, tell the servants I am ' not at home ' to any one. Call Watty, my dear. \u2014 Leave me, Ellen ! leave me ! I am dizzy, cold, and ill.\" Ellen summoned Watkins, who looked cross and angry, and muttered about people's exciting her lady, and young folks always doing mischief. But Ellen was too much concerned at her friend's evident illness to heed all these side raps at herself. When, after some time, Mrs. Wentworth grew composed, and the pain hi her head lessened, Ellen yielded to Watkins' desire and left her. But it was solitary and dull in those large rooms below, and out of doors she dared not venture. She had an idea which she could not drive away : that some one still lurked about the house or the grounds. What a strange tale it was that Mrs. Wentworth's broken words pointed to. Could it indeed be that this very man, whose wonderful power of voice and subtle flattery had fascinated her in her young days \u2014 could it be that he was all the time a near connection : her own unfortunate aunt's husband ? Had she the"], [185, "WHO IS HE? 177 aunt \u2014 ever loved him, or had it been a mere passing intoxication which, like her own, changed into horror and loathing ? Had no one been near to step in and save that \" Ellen Raymond \" as she herself had been saved? And then her thoughts went to the friend in need, who had dared so much out of pure chivalric, manly care for a woman, for a young girl \u2014 a stranger. But oh ! that she could hear the plain and con nected history ! Burning words had been dropped at times from her father, from Goody Fleet, and from Mrs. Wentworth. There was some family curse \u2014 some solemn mystery : was it all played out ? Did not the sins of the fathers \u2014 the sins, and perhaps the sorrows, come down to the children ? It was well that such a train of thought should be disturbed, and Ellen raised a very pale and troubled face as the door opened, and the servant anounced Mr. Vaughan ; not without a half-spoken excuse, and that he supposed his mistress did not include this gentle- man in her sweeping order to \" let in no one.\" Watkins had before told her that Mrs. Went worth had fallen into an uneasy dose, and they had discussed the propriety of sending for a medical man. It was altogether with a feeling of relief that she wrelcomed Mr. Vaughan. She hastily told him of her friend's illness, and then observed that he was unusually grave, if not depressed. He said he expected to find some distress, for he had met one who had been at the house. vol. ii. N"], [186, "178 UPS AND DOWNS. \"Zanelli?\" asked EUen. \"Yes. You did not see him, I hope? The rascal ! I only wish However, all he needs is money ; money, and a sneaking, greedy desire for revenge. He thought he should do as he hked with Mrs. Wentworth. He is quite 'up' in the history of the neighbourhood, I see, and doubtless he laid a deep plan. He preferred maintaining his incognito, if he could. He might introduce himself in a very different fashion, he hinted \u2014 but, forsooth ! his love of honest independence made him prefer trying to get on by his own profession rather than press any claims ! Humbug ! He had the grace to start on seeing me. I turn up too often on his path, it seems ; and he lays up a deep grudge against me. No ; don't be afraid, there is no talk of daggers or pistols \u2014 only \u00a3 s. d. I have him now, and he knows what depends on his proved absence.

Mrs. Wentworth declared herself better, and insisted on seeing Mr. Vaughan in her own sitting room. They had a long interview, and he said as he wished Ellen good-bye \u2014 \" Take care of her ; she is much excited. Don't get upon old days. Read or talk to her about something else.\" \" Yes ; but oh, Mr. Vaughan, do you know \u2014 has she told you anything ? Do you know all about it?\" \" Indeed, nothing,\" he said, returning from the door again, and approaching her, \" except that this man \u2014 Mrs. Harding's singing master, public singer, gambling rascal \u2014 has been in some strange way, long ago, connected with your family. She has told me nothing more. It was I who had to reason, and to explain what I had done.\" Ellen made no answer, but absently turned the leaves of a book on the table. Mr. Vaughan again said good-bye, but still he lingered, holding her hand and then shaking it warmly*-. \" You won't forget : you are to apply to me, if there is anything I can do. How lonely for you this evening,\" he added, looking doubtfully round the room, and then again at her, with a quick light in his eye and a word on his lip.

I don't much care now \u2014 now that I know he is gone again. Thanks to you.\" A bell sounded : she said it was Mrs. Wentworth's. Then he dropped her hand and went. She did spend some time with her friend in her dressing-room, and read to her. But she was early dismissed, and before seeking her bed she settled that she would pay an early visit next morn ing to the sea, taking her luncheon and portfolio. If Goody should be in an amiable mood, perhaps from her she might coax some history of all she so wanted to know. At all events the fresh waves would disperse the trouble, and she could draw, or read, or dream, just as it happened, and be ready for Mrs. Wentworth when she left her room."], [189, "181 CHAPTER XIV. THE PASSING BELL. It was not a bright morning. The sun battled among the heavy curtains of mist and vapour which clung very near to earth. It was still heavy and somewhat close. The foaming waves and the deli- cious sea scent would, Ellen thought, be doubly acceptable; and she walked fast up the steep and narrow lane, pausing now and then to pull down a wreath of honeysuckle, or to admire the early and unsullied deUcate beauty and almond scent of the ground-loving pale convolvulus. It was very still; a sound of voices in a field broke the silence once, and there was a faint tinkle from a sheep bell, while a hushed, continuous rush told of the neighbourhood of the sea. All at once another sound fell, with startling force \u2014 deep, ringing, solemn ! It was the Ashby Cross church bell ; it was the announcement of Death. Hark ! Ellen counted, and knew it was for a woman. Then there was a pause, and she tried to count the strokes which again boomed forth at slow intervals. The number would tally with the person's"], [190, "182 UPS AND DOWrNS. age. Such was the village custom. But before she had counted forty a party of three villagers, two women and a man, came up the lane, overtook her, then stopped and greeted her. \" A dull morning, miss.\" \" Who is dead ?\" Ellen asked. \" Ye don't know, then ? I reckoned ye were just bound for the place, knowdng as how the poor old soul was one of the household long ago ! 'Tis Goody's death knell that is sounding ! Some said, she should n't have no bell and nothing ; but Rob is a kind soul, and you see he knowed her when she was young. And after all, folks don't know : may be Goody wasn't so bad as she seemed.\" \" Goody Fleet? It is very sudden then. I saw her yesterday myself,\" said Ellen, feeling rather shocked. \" Yes, ma'am,\" said the elder woman, leaving her companions, who walked on, \" 'Twas awsome sudden. Goody was well as you or I be, only yesterday*-. My maid went to her on an errand, and corned back full of how the poor old soul was busy washing up her clothes. Never no help would she take !

But Goody had"], [191, "THE PASSING BELL. 183 ner troubles back along, and didn't care for company or pleasant talk \u2014 and she would just laugh and lay out for all they said of her.\" \"But how did she was she ill at all?\" Ellen interrupted. \" Not to say ill, miss. I heard say \u2014 indeed little Matty Simpson was there at the time \u2014 that towards afternoon, a gentleman was climbing and poking about the churchyard, and then down the cliff steps to the beach. Jack White saw him, and said he was a stranger chap \u2014 most hkely out of foreign parts \u2014 one of the travelling men that come about of a time, with hair on his lips. And so, as Matty says, he corned up the back way to the cottage, and just gived a jump over the low wall there, and she saw him ; and then the girl says, he gived a sharp look all around like, and seemed tired, and pushed back his hat, and spoke up to Matty pleasant enough, she says. Says he, ' Little maiden, will you please to inform me who lives here now ? ' So Matty minded her manners, and up and spoke, and said, ' Goody Fleet, sir.' 'Aye,' says he, ' indeed ! ' And then from that he walks quick and hasty like, round to the very back door where Goody was bending over her wash tub, and he makes a low bow, and bids her good-morning, with a smile on his face ; and Matty says, when the old woman looked up, she gived one great cry, and let fall her things hi the dirt, and looked like death itself. Then, the girl says, he just"], [192, "184 UPS AND DOWNS. stepped forward and lays his hand on Goody, and speaks to her in a soft way like, and looks into her face the while ; upon which, up Goody jumps like mad \u2014 a-shaking all over, and wringing her hands and moaning. Then she holds up her fist and bids him away \u2014 says she, ' Is the dead to come in that fashion to terrify me ? ' And so then Matty says, she just fell down of a lump ; overcome, as you may say. And when Matty tried to come to the fore and help her up, he just bid her go away for water, and he takes and puts his arm round the old body and lifts her up, and speaks. And Matty says, after Goody stared at him for a bit, she seemed to come round ; and wlren Matty come back with a cup of spring water, she found them at high words, and he telling and telling, and swinging his arms as they foreign men do ; and Goody, she was all up, and her face in a great passion, and Matty stood back out of sight, afeard you see; and at last he went off, shaking his fist and looking angry, for all he smiled and even made a bow. Then Goody began to cry and shake her hands, and talk of the 'dead' and ' murder ; ' and so the girl got terrified, and she ran back along to the village, and called up my mother, Granny French, as they call her; and when those two get back to the cottage (for mother can't move so fast as a young woman, not that she is infirm for her years) they found poor old Goody lying along all of a heap, and her eyes rolling, and"], [193, "THE PASSING BELL. 185 her face black.

That was all the words she said, hut once, ' Ellen,' and then, ' the Countess ; ' and my mother being a godly woman, she repeated the Lord's Prayer ; for though we had sent for the minister there was no time, we saw, and before the last words had come, Goody was a corpse.

Another confirmation of mystery, and one less chance of her ever knowing its meaning ! That this \"stranger man, wdth hair on his lip, and a soft voice,\" was Zanelli, she could not doubt. Zanelli, that dark, mysterious man, around wdiom her schooldays' fancy and vanity had altogether woven a romance ! Those singing lessons, in which with skUful craft he had insinuated portions of his tale \u2014 hinting at former greatness, pohtical troubles, and the obligation of descending to turn his natural gift of song to a means of livelihood.

The awaken ing was rude, for when the mask once fell, and the voice which had charmed was no longer heard, a sensation of horror and loathing foUowed.

She could not throw off the association which connected hhn with what she would fain forget and blot out. At last, when she had believed it buried, and had learned to separate Mr. Vaughan of the present from the Mr. Manners of the past, \u2014 just as she was secure, and dared to look about with assured safety and comfort, this dark figure again crosses her path : and she knows that he is no dream shadow, but a living reality, whose life is intermixed with her own \u2014 evidently an actor in some family tragedy, one hi that group composed of her own people, her father and mother, her aunt and her friend. It was hardly to be wondered at, if such thoughts overpowered her, and that sadly and timidly, under pressure of great fear, she slowly returned to Blair. Blair ! that sunny home of luxury and ease, her place of refuge. But trouble had found her out even here ! Mrs. Wentworth was very unweU \u2014 depressed and fatigued. She was not surprised at hearing of Goody's death, or of the visit which had caused it. She gave languid orders that the funeral should be cared for, and made no answer when she was told the verdict of the coroner's inquest \u2014 \" Death from apoplexy.\" She desired that the body should lie as near as could be to the Raymond vault \u2014 saying that Goody had been a faithful servant to them. Nothing would rouse her. In vain Ellen and"], [196, "188 UPS AND DOWNS. Mr. Vaughan tried to interest her in passing events : she refused to leave her own morning room, and Watkins grew wrathful and aggravating in proportion as she was really anxious. This went on for a few weeks ; it was a trying time, and Ellen looked thin and care-worn. She did not like to go beyond the grounds, and could not force herself to draw or read. Stories were afloat in the village of a ghost \u2014 or rather two \u2014 at the cottage; and it was affirmed that if Goody's grave was opened, it would be found empty. The dreary monotony of these days was broken one morning by a letter from Miss Moore, an nouncing her engagement to Cecil Mortimer. There was also a paragraph in it which gave Ellen serious uneasiness. \" We hear that Alick Hay has com pletely charmed Mrs. Harding, and that her doors are ever open to him. She has been giving a series of Soirdes Musicales, and a friend tells me that among many handsome girls, one Miss Raymond was undoubtedly the belle. My informant proceeds to say, that rumour assigns the attraction of Mrs. Harding's daughter, as the reason for Mr. Hay's frequent visits, ar.d that all his leisure evenings are spent in that drawing-room. Don't grieve over this faithless desertion, EUen.\" \"Mischief! it will end in wrong, I am very sure,\" Ellen said to herself. \" Oh, Hetty*-, what can restrain you ! \""], [197, "THE PASSING BELL. 189 Another sentence pleased her. \" I can't tell you how kindly I have been welcomed into the family ; your dear little sister's tearful smile was perhaps the most precious, next to his mother's. Ellen, you must and shall learn to do justice to them all! Beneath the faults, there is much sterling good. Granville has written a truly brotherly letter to me. I showed it to my own brother, who smiled in his grave fashion, and remarked, \" He is one whose approbation is worth having.\" Nothing can be kinder than Cecil. Such a good son and brother must surely make a good husband. He won't either turn them out of the old mansion, or take me to play a perplexed and secondary part, as he says, among them. So we are to have that small but cheerful cottage at the end of the street, from which a door can easily be broken leading into the Bank garden; for the two gardens run towards each other and meet at the bottom. Do you remember it ? \" There was so much quiet cheerful hope and such frank happiness in this letter, that it roused EUen up a little, and she wrote a warm answer, from her heart. When this was done, a slight feeling of sadness again crept over her. There was a contrast between her own lot and that of her friend, which struck home. It was settled, after many difficulties, that Mrs. Wentworth should leave home for a time. A trip"], [198, "190 UPS AND DOWNS. to Wales was proposed, and hailed by Ellen with no little pleasure. Her one drawback was the leaving Mrs. Legard, whose sufferings had much increased, and who reckoned so much on every visit EUen could give her. These visits were fast becoming one of Ellen's chief pleasures ; but in even this there was a drawback, for Mrs. Wentworth would suffer no rival. Her jealous affection was easdy alarmed : and nothing but the most exclusive preference satisfied her. \" I must be first or nothing,\" she often said ; and Ellen smiled, and could answer truly, \"You are first!\" Perhaps this very thorn which grew beside her dearest joy was good for her. Her love for Mrs. Wentworth became more and more unselfish. It brought heavy duties, and these EUen tried her best meekly and patiently to accept, with the con sciousness that she had thrown up nearer ties for this romantic passion of friendship: it had been a seduc tive dream to her, into which she could pass from her daily trials ; now it was a reality, and hers was not a spirit to fall back at the first touch of difficulty and pain: rather it roused her and brought out her best feelings. She was learning to think of Mrs. Wentworth, as one needing her ; one to be cherished and watched ; one for whom she might be even called on to suffer. Very patiently, therefore, did Ellen take all the fretful speeches which were called up by her expression of interest for any one else \u2014 any one but Mr. Vaughan. For Ellen to praise him,"], [199, "THE PASSING BELL. 191 was Mrs. Wentworth's best delight ; and under cover of the agreed friendship, this was now not difficult. But in her heart she wondered at Mrs. Wentworth being satisfied with such entirely frank and unembar rassed praise, such open and unscrupulous \" talking him over.\" When the cottage in which Goody Fleet had hved and died, came to be repaired and painted (which Farmer Lewis did in the rather vain hope of finding a tenant), in some ricketty corner cupboard, with various hoards of old china, faded ribbons, and so on, a soiled, sealed packet was discovered, directed in a stiff, large handwriting to \" Madam Wentworth's care.\" Mrs. Wentworth opened ft with trembling hands \u2014 for she was sadly weak and unnerved \u2014 and found therein a parcel of very dirty bank-notes and some sovereigns, carefully enveloped in, \u2014 first, a piece of cloth, and then some paper, so that they could not be felt outside. There was a piece of writing, too. \" I, Joan Fleet, widow, leave all this ' hush money ' to be given at my death to the present Uving Ellen Raymond, daughter to Gerald and Bertha Raymond of the Abbey.\" It was signed Joan Fleet ; but it was not witnessed or attested, and therefore in law valueless. \" ' Hush money ! ' \" exclaimed EUen ; \" what does she mean? And how did the poor old woman"], [200, "192 UPS AND DOWNS. manage to save such a sum, when over and over again she has told me of the scanty parish pay she received ? \" \"Oh, Goody was cared for!\" Mrs. Wentworth remarked ; \" she was an old servant, you remember, and your father, as the head of the family and then owner of the Abbey, made her an ample allowance.\" '\u25a0' But why does she say ' hush money'? \" \" Who can tell ? A whim. It is all nonsense. Of course, Ellen, you won't take it ?\" And Mrs. Wentworth laughed nervously, and the hectic flush had again spread on her face. Ultimately Goody's savings were given up for the maintenance of the only relation she had \u2014 a distant cousin \u2014 a poor, helpless idiot, heretofore kept by the parish entirely. And now the subject of Goody's death, her will, the stranger's visit, and all the ghost rumours passed away from Blair House, and the proposed journey wTas discussed, and \" packing up \" occupied both EUen and Watkins. Yet that word \" hush money \" would return and worry her ! It was a strange expression for Goody to use \u2014 a strange name for the pension so naturally and rightly given to an old retainer ! Somewhat heated and tired, and vexed with the continual reiteration of one idea, or one set of words in her ear, Ellen gladly heard that Mrs. Wentworth"], [201, "THE PASSING BELL. 193 had retired to her own room, in order to rest for the morrow's early journey. She begged that Miss Raymond would take a drive or walk out, and sent her \" Good night \" by Watkins, not wishing to be disturbed again. \" Yes ; I will have the pony-gig, if John can attend me,\" said Ellen; as she looked out on a lovely evening, and reckoned on a nice long visit to Mrs. Legard, staying as late as she dared on Mrs. Legard's account.

As the wheels grated over the well rolled gravel path, EUen had a feeling that she ought to stop. It was as if sleep reigned there, and that even this slight noise would disturb. All day it had been hot. A slight thunder shower towards the afternoon had refreshed the atmosphere, and now the lengthening shadows stole over the rain-sprinkled lawn, and subdued the extreme brightness produced by the circular mound which enclosed the entrance drive, and was thick set with geraniums, calceolarias, nemophyllas, verbenas, and other gay blossoms ; the carriage road being centred by a fine specimen of arbutus in a round setting of grass. Scrupulous care, dainty neatness pervaded everything, from the garden to the house ; although its mistress had no eyes to detect a fault.

The windows opened on to the lawn, which was not broken up by flower-beds, but lay in its mossy soft ness, sweeping upwards to the west with a gradual rise till it met the over-hanging branches of a short avenue of beeches. Their long shadows were now thrown far across the grass, while bright rays gleamed beneath \u25a0 the branches, quivering on the shining leaves and smooth bark, and turning a small green house into the semblance of flashing jewels. Perhaps no tree yields such a beautiful return to the sunshine as the beech, with its sweeping, but flat foliage ! An old, rough dog lay basking in the last ray of sunshine on a crimson mat, and some exquisitely tinted birds from Australia, in native language, \"Budgeree Gars,\" kept up a gentle twittering \u2014 the only sound, except the tick from the timepiece.

There she lay, as she had lain for some years now, \u2014 a mere shadow, worn and pale and fragile, her hands folded across her bosom, but her head slightly raised and turned, so as to catch the smallest sound ; and when Ellen greeted her, there was a flush of intense life and pleasure in the face, though the eyes were closed for ever. \" So you are going away ! it will be good for you. I have observed that your spirits have been below their usual level,\" was her greeting. \" There has been much annoyance lately. Mrs. Wentworth is fairly ill, and wants a change very sadly. I used to think that when once at Blair, I should never be much troubled again.\" \" That was a very young idea.\" \" Yes ; a very false one.

After a short and cold account of herself and her belongings, (which gave Ellen a pang of sorrow, and seemed to mark the estrangement which had grown between them) she returned to something of the old warmth of expression, as, with a long preface, she ventured to tell Ellen of some very unpleasant reports concerning her which had reached Poole ; and which, after great consideration, Bessie thought it due to her sister to warn her of. \"Of course, dear EUen, I can't for a moment beUeve them to be true ; but I long for authority from you to contradict each word. It was a lady whom Granville met at some London party, from whom it first came. But since then, some one at Poole told my sister-in-law, Miss Mortimer ; asking if it was true that Colonel Raymond's daughter had spent all her fortune and was in difficulties, and was now living as paid companion to some rich lady ? This was not the worst ; for my pride rose when p 2"], [220, "212 UPS AND DOWNS. she went on to say, that this lady's friends and relations were justly displeased and afraid, for that you were intriguing and lost no possible opportunity of prejudicing her against every one, and that when she was ill and subject to low spirits, you worked upon her fears so, that you had got her to promise to leave you her money. They further said that you had caused all the old servants to be sent away, so that you might rule the house, and that all the lady's cast-off clothes and jewels were transferred to you, depriving the lady's maid, an old faithful servant, of her just perquisites. That you encouraged her to invite objectionable people to the house. It can't be true ! Do write to me and relieve my mhid ; for, God knows, I am weighed down by trouble, and this seems doubly hard. We think \u2014 I mean my mother-in-law and I \u2014 for I couldn't help talking of it all to her (oh, she is so kind and good to me !) and to Louisa Moore, your friend, and Cecil's future wife \u2014 We think, dear Ellen, you should he so very careful ; and that your position is a delicate one, being dear Mrs. W's favourite. And, if I were you, I think I would not even take presents ; though, of course, there is no real harm in it. But her relations are not rich, and naturally are inclined to look at yrou with jealousy. Of course, wdth so large a family as I hear there is, they would be glad for one daughter to be in your place. This was what the lady said to Granville ; and, by the"], [221, "FICTION AND FACT. 213 way he writes, ' Warn Ellen, impress it upon her, that she being in a false position has need of more than ordinary circumspection ; and pray, Bessie, ascertain if she is really in need of money.' \" \"Your letters don't seem very pleasing, Lena. No bad news, I hope?\" Mrs. Wentworth said. \" It is a plot ! \" Ellen answered. \" I mean,\" she added, seeing Mrs. Wentworth's look of inquiry, \" I mean, it is plain I must leave you. I must go ! \u2014 I can't stand this ! of all I have ever borne, I think this is bitterest!\" Then followed a long and excited conversation. Ellen persisted in her resolution to go and live any where \u2014 as governess perhaps ; and Mrs. Wentworth imploring her to be calm and listen to reason, at one moment ; and the next, saying harsh and bitter things of her own cousins, and vowing that not one of them should ever enter Blair again. It ended in Mrs. Wentworth having an hysterical fit, and wildly crying for Ellen never to forsake her; which conditionally was promised. At last Mrs. Wentworth fell asleep holding Ellen's hand; and as she watched the beautiful but pale face, and her attitude of almost childlike helplessness, Ellen resolved never to desert her. She would and could brave all the world's slander for her sake. Perhaps this very storm would, so to speak, clear the air and drive away for ever and entirely any little distrust or jealousy which had now and then crept up in"], [222, "214 UPS AND DOWNS. Mrs. Wentworth's mind. With honest pride, Ellen raised her head, as she determined not to anger Mrs. Wentworth against her relations, but on the contrary, to take their parts \u2014 to ensure their getting their due, and to prove that her love and devotion was disinterested, and herself independent. There is a pleasure in noble resolution and self sacrifice, and Ellen lay down late that night happy, in spite of the ruffled morning. But on sober .reflec tion, it was decided that these charges must not be passed -with sdent scorn : they must be sifted and met with prompt, steady denial. It was irksome, and exceedingly trying to one of Ellen's nature, to go over one by one the several offences laid to her charge. It was skiUuUy* contrived, that a good deal of truth as to fact was brought in, though twisted so as to take a form entirely opposite. For distance, EUen had, by urgent representation of his infamous conduct, procured the dismissal of a hitherto favourite footman, whose handsome person and good manner had attracted Mrs. Wentworth; she little knowing what his conduct was in the servants' hall. Another poor girl in the kitchen, who was tyrannized over and injured by the despotic cook, and was fast becoming slavish and mean, Ellen had befriended, and with Mrs. Wentworth's consent (reluctantly granted, as it was against her rule to interfere with the domestic arrangements) she got her hito another place. As to the notion of her being a \" paid companion,\""], [223, "FICTION AND FACT. 215 she knew that, in spite of all her contradiction and denial, Arabella had hugged it as a true fact. It was much the same in everything : a grain of truth almost lost in the process it had gone through. Mrs. Wentworth was roused, and she wrote straight to Mr. Clare. She did him the justice \" to beUeve that he was no party to this scheme.\" But she thought it well for him to be made clearly to see that far from advancing the \" interests\" of the family, nothing could widen the distance between them and herself so entirely. It had already taught her a lesson, which she should not be slow to profit by \u2014 viz., to take care not to invite people to her house, who under the cloak of friendship and cousinship, acted the part of a spy. Mr. Clare's answer waited them at Blair, and con siderably upset Mrs. Wentworth. The gauntlet had been thrown, he said, and he was nothing loth to take it up. As to the small feminine gossip, which he was sorry, but not surprised, to hear his family had dabbled in, it was in itself worth nothing. When a young person quits her father's house and is found living with a rich friend, it is probable remarks will be made ; but nothing but the fitting of the cap could give them the stamp of reality : like all other female chatter, it would have vanished in smoke.

As a father, he was glad of this occasion to declare his unwillingness at any time for his children to visit at a house the arrangements of which he could not sanction or approve, &c, &c. Mrs. Wentworth was indignant ! Ellen feared that it would make her ill again ; but was relieved to find that, on the contrary, it roused her. She would not submit to be browbeaten and slandered. She had hitherto been only too wilhng to withdraw from all general, disagreeable society : choosing her intimates, she liked to go her own way, careless of remark, or the being excluded from the \" respectable coterie ; \" now, she would rise and take her right ful place. It would never do to be ridden over by this insufferable priest ! She would see if she had lost her power and influence. Accordingly*, orders were sent forthwith, for expensive preparations for a grand archery fete, to whicli all the county should desire to be asked. Ellen thought there must be something good in this Mr. Clare. Certainly he was not mercenary. He chose to give up all the worldly advantage, and the possible future benefit, rather than expose his children to what he thought bad example. That was fatherly : she tried hard to be generous in judging him, for the word \" patro nised,\" as applied to her, was hard to bear. Her walks to Mrs. Legard helped her to this view. That lady was no longer in the drawing-room ; she"], [225, "FICTION AND FACT. 217 was unable to leave her own room, and it was some times with difficulty that she talked. It was a striking contrast, that room and its influence, from all the stir which now roused Blair and its inmates. Angry bitterness could not flourish in that atmosphere of suffering and peace. A word from Mrs. Legard changed the very aspect of a trouble, and sent Ellen home stdl of courage. It was with a smile of true scorn, that one morning Mrs. Wentworth pointed out a paragraph to Ellen from her newspaper. It ran thus : \" We are glad to learn that the worthy aud estimable rector of , the Rev. E. C. Clare's laborious labours of love, have met with a reward as little expected, we understand, as we hope it will be acceptable. We hear that through the death of a distant relative in India, a very handsome fortune falls to the next of kin, which was last month proved to be our active rector, and indefatigable magistrate \" \"A bird in the hand, &c, eh, Ellen? That was why, ' cousin Julia's ' possible legacy from me, was so nobly set aside. Yet, I really believed this man at least sincere, though I always hated him.

ShaU it be pale sea green picked out with gold, or the slightest blush of rose with silver? And then the arrangements of the flower stands and the hangings. Indeed, indeed, love, I must play the tyrant, and forbid you going this once.\" \"Very well,\" was Ellen's answer, true to her settled plan of making her friend's wishes, in all things not wrong, her first care. But the shade of disappointment which her tell-tale face could not hide, did not escape Mrs. Wentworth. \" You have sadly lost your capability of enjoy ment, EUen. AU this, done mostly for your sake, seems a worry to you. Yet \u2014 if I attempt a thing of the kind \u2014 I resolve it shall be no failure. I never fail in what I undertake, cost what it will !

But a moment after, the shadow came again on her face ;"], [227, "FICTION AND FACT. 219 she did so desire to go to see Mrs. Legard ! The maid Emma had sent a note, informing Ellen that her mistress had passed a very bad night, and hinted that it would be a comfort if Miss Raymond could spare haU an hour. Mr. and Mrs. Damer had been written to, but they were absent from home. EUen was grievously anxious. Longing to be at that bedside, but forced to bend her attention to aU these preparations. She dared not even explain her feelings, for fear of exciting Mrs. Wentworth's jealousy, or altogether upsetting her by the bare mention of death. But the day passed, and it was evening ; dinner was over ; Mr. Vaughan had been of the party, and now she left him talking to Mrs. Wentworth, and stroUed out on the lawn. A note was brought, a mere scrawl, from Emma. The messenger waited for an answer. EUen ran back to the draAving-room with a flushed face. \" Worthy, may I go ? She is worse \u2014 very ill, and no one there but her maid! Mrs. Legard, I mean! I won't be long, or \u2014 or \" she added, turning round to leave the room, \" I may be wanted to sit up.

How could she enjoy this gay fete, with such suffering present to her mind? Just as EUen was about to start, she found Mr. Vaughan with his hat on standing in the portico, prepared to accompany her. \" Yes ; you must let me,\" he said, in answer to her look of surprise. \" Mrs. Wentworth is resting. She herself proposed it: she does not like your walking about alone at this hour. She fears the scene will be too much for you. Must you go ? \" Ellen only answered by taking his arm and walk ing fast. \"It is pleasant to see Mrs. Wentworth's enthu siasm, her energy and youthfulness ! \" Mr. Vaughan remarked. \" She does love you very dearly, EUen, and her desire for you to appear in your best looks is quite the anxiety of a mother.\" EUen could not heartily respond just then ; she thought a mother would have had a more dehcate, a finer sympathy ; but she did not say so. \" Do you think she wdl succeed in getting those unapproachable folks, whose presence is supposed to be indispensable?\" asked Ellen."], [229, "FICTION AND FACT. 221 \" Umph ! I don't know. There is some jealousy in that quarter. An old story about the patronage of a ball, I believe.\" \" Oh ! Then it is not because \" but she stopped abruptly, not knowing if she ought to say what she intended. \"It is said that a certain high personage was greatly scandalized by hearing of Mrs. Wentworth's visiting certain parties at Forence ; but I believe myself,\" said Mr. Vaughan, \" that this is only the handle, the peg on which to pitch the quarrel. Mrs. Wentworth's beauty and wealth made her very popular here at one time, before she was so much abroad. She was always one, too, who took her own way, and was no slave to custom, and that was not to be suffered : she was to be ' kept down.' And then there were, so I understand, some mysterious stories afloat, and her name got mixed up. A young widow is after all very unprotected. But I am entirely ignorant.\" He ended suddenly. \"I suppose the mysterious stories related to the Abbey,\" said Ellen, quietly. \" If I could only know the true history of all that time ! Do you know, Mr. Vaughan?\" she asked, quickly. \"Nothing \u2014 nothing whatever. This poor lady,\" he said, presently, \" is she dangerously ill ?

I thought you were an admirer of friendship, and thought that it made up for hosts of relations.\" \" Yes, yes ; exactly ! You quote my own words, I see,\" he said, smiling. \" And I do admire it. And moreover WeU, Ellen ! I rejoice to find your interpretation of the duties it involves. They can't be too many, too near. But you are young, and receive strong impressions.

Surely you are not angry! Have I annoyed you ? \" He asked this on her pushing on, without heeding his offered arm, which he had withdrawn for a moment to open and shut the gate. \"No; of course not,\" she said, stopping and turning round at once. \" But I feel impatient ! We have lingered so ! Now good-night, and thank you;\" and she rushed into the back door, there to make breathless inquiry. The answer was such as to send her at once up-stairs. Mr. Vaughan remained to learn the state of the case, and then went back to prepare Mrs. Wentworth for Ellen's non-return. It was not expected that Mrs. Legard would live out the night. # * * * * \" Poor darling ! My dear, dear, Lena !

A canary was singing a jubilant morning song, greeting the bright sunshine. The room was luxu riously fitted up with a carved ivory and ebony toilette stand. Jewels lay on the table. A few chosen pictures hung on the pale pink and white walls. Mrs. Wentworth, surrounded with a quantity of soft and rich lace, was reading the morning paper, and drinking her coffee. Drawings of plans for tents, and other preparations for the fete, lay about. A pile of delicate silks were heaped on an ottoman, awaiting choice. Ellen looked round with fatigued, heavy eyes, and noted all this contrast to the scene she had just left. That bird's shrill song ! she put her hand to her head ; then came faint, yet distinct, the church bell. It fairly upset her; she sank down on the nearest seat, and hiding her face, cried. \" Watkins, Watkins ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Went worth, shut the window at once. \" It is a barbarous custom, that dreadful bell ! So harrowing ! enough to drive people into madness ; and, see ! cover up ' Petite : ' Miss Raymond does not like his song.

However she was feeling truly sorry for Ellen. There was a mixture of her usual horror of all sickness and death, a subject she never willingly met, her vexation at Ellen's fatigue and sorrow, and the promptings of her own better heart. \"You are quite ill, Ellen ! Poor woman, I hope she did not suffer very much. To think of you being in such a horrid position ! I must think you outstepped your duty ; you were no old friend even Don't, don't fret, Ellen ! What is to become of me, if you are ill ? Just to see your sad face ! \" \" But, Worthy, I am not sad,\" Ellen said, coming towards her, and touching the long soft hah which had escaped from the lace, not being yet dressed. \" At least, I am sorry, of course, at losing her ; and I am a little tired, perhaps, but not ill.

She did not sleep : she went over again the last night's scene. She re called and gathered up carefully all the words she had, from time to time, in their brief acquaintance, heard from Mrs. Legard. Among all, one sentence struck her as remarkable. One day, in speaking of her former life, and say ing she had been a very eager, warm-tempered girl, always ready to do and to act, Mrs. Legard said, \" But as one grows older, all one's desires and aspira tions simplify; and at last, instead of begging a blessing on this and that scheme, and seeking grace to ' do ' this and that good work \u2014 it all seems to come to that one petition, that His will be done \u2014"], [235, "FICTION AND FACT. 227 borne \u2014 by us !

She had joined with a full heart in a prayer used by Mr. Damer \u2014 he was there after all, taking Dr. Edgehill's place \u2014 that each of them then present might so fulfil their respective duties, that their last hour might be like hers whose pro bation was now ended !

A few persons were invited to Blair two or three days before the grand party \u2014 Sir Frederic de Lisle and his little wife among them. Mrs. Wentworth showed herself complete mistress of an art not common, \u2014 to plan beforehand without apparent fuss. Her orders were clear and full, and as no expense was spared, it was no great wonder that everything succeeded ; and this point was dwelt on by some persons conscious of occasional failures. But it was a mistake : money is much, but alone it will not do. Profuse expenditure may fail in grace and beauty. Ellen entreated to be allowed to preside at the lay ing out the fruit and flower part of the banquet : she had one or two pretty fancies which she wished to realise. Her request was granted ; at least so far as Mrs. Wentworth's power went. There was the for midable chef de cuisine to talk over; and as in many ways his ideas and Miss Raymond's differed, this was no easy task. Mr. Vaughan at last conquered him ; employing no little skill, as he averred. Ellen, with"], [238, "230 UPS AND DOWNS. Mr. Vaughan as an attendant, was suffered to place the exquisite fruit and lovely flowers as she liked. Very eager she was over a certain centre-piece, a pyramid of fruit ; and when it was completed, she fairly clapped her hands with delight at its beauty, and declared she must make a sketch forthwith. What a fruit piece it would be ! Stately pines, blooming peaches, and the most splendid grapes, purple and green, with bright cherries to \" light them up \" as she said. In fact every fruit that could be had was there, each one placed with apparent carelessness, but really with carefully studied artisti cal effect. Even the rival power, the grim cook, shifted his paper cap, and said, \" It would do ! \" There had been great talk, many hopes and fears expressed about the weather. Mrs. Wentworth said she knew it would be fine ; for fine weather must have been a fairy gift made to her : she invariably had it, when she particularly needed it. She was right now*, and the sun came out to do Ids all-powerful part towards making the Blair fete successful. There was archery and dancing, und the power of strolling about the grounds \u2014 alway*s beautiful, but, of course, completely \" done up \" for the day ; shrubs full of blossom, delicate hot-house plants, abounding everywhere.

This room was now heautifuUy painted and fitted up, and a temporary gaUery erected for an excellent military band, courteously allowed to attend. The company was numerous, and they lingered on, enjoying the delicious coolness of the evenhig, and forming naturally into coteries and groups ; but aU assembled later in the drawing - room and ball-room, a door being broken between the two for the occasion, to hear the concert. Two London stars were there, and several others well worth listen ing to. It was pronounced a happy thought \u2014 a capital ending, to the day. But Ellen could not help a slight feeUng of alarm, as one by one the singers came forward : she believed he was sure to appear. She hardly dared look up, till the first notes relieved her. It was not his voice : not one of them could be compared to him in that ! Naturally, as almost a daughter of the house, Ellen was called upon to come forward a good deal; and a very excellent support she found in Mr. Vaughan. He was ever at hand to provide a partner for a forsaken damsel, or to talk to a for gotten dowager. He was everywhere, and saw in a moment everything; yet Ellen scarcely turned without finding him near herself. He knew the right moment for providing her with refreshment ;"], [240, "232 UPS AND DOWNS. he took care that she had a seat, and did not stand in a draught : his care seemed to surround her hke a mantle, without fuss or effort.

But she was not allowed to pass scot free either ; Mr. Vaughan's quiet but very devoted attentions, so quite a thing of course as they had become to her, could not fad to be observed and commented on. Her beauty, in full bloom and perfection this day, had attracted every eye ; and by and by she became conscious that herself and Mr. Vaughan were con sidered, if not actually engaged, as very near it. She read it in the speeches of her partners, and the way in which it was taken for granted that he would sit by her. He was asking her to dance with him. \" No; please get some one else; do, Mr. Vaughan.\" \" Why ? I have not been once your partner ; I have done my duty as you bade me, heroically : I claim my reward now.

He should remember that you were no relation of the poor lady's, and for a very short time known to her at all,\" continued Mr. Vaughan, warmly, and unconsciously betraying that he resented some opinion, implied or expressed, un favourable to EUen. \" It is strange how people do misunderstand ; what very odd notions they get hold of!\" \" It is of no great consequence in this instance, is"], [243, "THE STOLEN INTERVIEW. 235 it ? \" said Ellen, smiling. \" Mr. Damer can't know anything whatever of me, nor is he likely ever to do so.\" ss \" But I can't bear to have you misjudged by any one \u2014 even by him. Besides, it has struck me that Damer does know something of you ; somehow he always gets me on the subject, and draws me out, in a way which he has : he implies an interest about you ; why, I don't know.\" Mr. Vaughan spoke in a slightly rufiled tone, and hesitated, as he always did when at all \"put out.\" \"He is kind,\" she said, dryly, and then she changed the subject. But perhaps, in her own mind, she did guess at a reason for this interest. She sighed at the thought, for there was some pleasure in it after all. But it was hard, that it always happened for her to be misunderstood in that quarter. Appearances and circumstances seemed cunningly to conspire against her. For a few days, Blair remained gay. Besides the comphmentary calls of enquiry, visitors stayed in the house, to talk it all over and to eat up the \" ice and cake.\" In due time the last party left, and even the beautiful flowers, cherished as they had been, drooped and were cast away. The house subsided into its accustomed habits by degrees ; and EUen declared her intention of spending the next morning at the Abbey, or, after such a spell of fine weather,"], [244, "236 UPS AND DOWNS. there would be rain, and her sketch would fare badly. \" I can't go with you \u2014 I have heaps of letters to write; but perhaps I may drive over and fetch you home : and you will draw all the better for being alone and uninterrupted.

He doesn't choose to believe that I shall be industrious for a month after our dissipation ! \" \"Doesn't he?

She made a desperate plunge ; drew in [the chimneys, and then became completely engrossed, deaf and blind to all sound or sight but her paper and her subject. Twenty or thirty minutes passed : she was intent"], [245, "THE STOLEN INTERVIEW. 237 on giving due effect to the depth of the porch and the wreaths of ivy which hung over it, more pictur esquely than tidily. All at once \" Smut,\" the little terrier, raised his head and gave a sharp shrill bark. \" What is it, doggie ? Don't bark at Farmer Lewis.\" Then there was a rustling among the high trailing rose-trees, which formed a thick hedge running down one side of the lawn, till it was lost in what was now a veritable wilderness of scrubwood, and weeds, and tangled coarse grass. This part of the grounds had been called the rose garden, and had been sacred to the Abbey ladies. It was this particular wing of the budding, its ivy porch and French windows, and the peeps of Blair grounds, standing high above the thick tops of the Abbey woods, which Mrs. Went worth so much desired a picture of. It was away from the part used by the present occupants, and had been long left to its wild decay. Old Jeffries, once the proud head gardener, sometimes dragged his stiff limbs so far ; and he mournfully looked about, till the remembrance of other days, and all the bright blossoms, and young faces, and ringing voices, was too much, and he was fain to go away, shaking his poor old head, and more than half confirmed in his belief that it was haunted. This idea just flitted across Ellen's mind, as she looked up and saw no cause for the crackling of the branches: and again Smut set up his head and barked defiance."], [246, "238 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Nonsense, Smut ; lie down, sir : \" an order im mediately obeyed ; and all was quiet for another five minutes. Then again Smut's slumbers were disturbed ; he started up and gave tongue with redoubled vehemence, and Ellen saw some one approaching. It was a man ; but the sun was in her eyes, and more than that, she failed to discover. He stopped and looked about ; then took another step ; then paused, and plucked off a branch from a tempting mountain ash, strung thick with its coral gems. It was not Mr. Vaughan : not a bit his walk ! Who could it he ? A wild idea brought the colour to her face for one second ; the next, she shaded her eyes with her hand, and saw it confirmed ; it was indeed a Mortimer : but then a deep sigh, and a shiver of fear followed, for it was John Mortimer, without a doubt ! She was very still, hardly breathing. Then her hands turned cold. She went on making strokes mechanically, but without consciousness or purpose. Only a few seconds intervened between her recog nition and his greeting, spoken close by her. But to her it seemed like a long time ; and every nerve was strung tight, expecting the wrords, which, when they broke the silence, made her start violently and visibly. \"Did I startle y*ou? Good day, fair EUen ! well met!\" She bowed, but did not look at him. He took her hand, pencil and all. \" Come ! I must shake hands,\""], [247, "THE STOLEN INTERVIEW. 239 holding it with a close, tight pressure, and gazing intently into her face. With a strong effort, feeling how needful all her presence of mind and coolness was, she raised her eyes ; and she saw how extremely pale and haggard he was. Yet, how handsome ! Had she forgotten it, or had he really improved? Yet there was the same, even more of the old rakish look about his dress, his carriage, and his expression. She took a long breath, and said slowly \"How do you do?\" He laughed, and said in return, \"How are you? But the question is useless. Blair agrees with you. Ellen, you are handsomer than ever ! Younger by two years, by Jove ! \" Then, dropping her hand, as she persisted in trying to withdraw it, he said in a careless tone, \" And how is your friend ? Does the love thrive? So you are drawing, are you? The old place, too. So this is the Abbey, the stronghold of the Raymond pride ! A rum old barrack ; and typical of the state of the family, I fear.

There was a reckless daring mixed up with both sadness and amusement which frightened her. Then he pulled forward Smut by the ears. \" I was reconnoitring when this animal gave the alarm. Didn't think how close I was to you, Ellen? \u2014 looking to see if you were the same, or altered, but had to beat a retreat, or this y7elping cui' might have caught my heels.

Don't move ! sit still \u2014 be quiet. Let me have just a few moments to forget unpleasant facts.\" There was a strange, dreary tone in his voice. He looked so ill too, and yet so eager, that sur prised, half-frightened, and somewhat pitying him, she complied. She remained motionless and silent. By degrees, his eyes fell from her face to her hand, which still held the portfolio ; for he was like one in a dream \u2014 still keeping up that low cooing whistle. It excited her. What ailed him ? How very lonely it was ! No one within call, she well knew. How strange, how utterly unlooked for, his being so near her, and in this odd and new mood. She could not bear it ; and wdth a hasty movement, she quickly and nervously undid her pencil case, counted the pencils, put them back \u2014 drew on her gloves. A long sigh broke from him. He moved, too ; and raising himself up, he leaned against a tree stem, folded his arms and shut his eves. Then she noted the hollow, mournful look of his face, the great palor, and all the marks of care and suffering. She was sorry for him : and perhaps the feeling was expressed in her face, for he suddenly VOL. II.

She turned away and covered her face with her hands. Her heart ached for her sister. The truth had at last opened to Bessie, then ! Her idol was overthrown : all her most innocent dreams of happiness, all her true, faithful love was withered up. And this was the man who had wilfully done it, and now almost boasted of the deed! \" It is dreadful,\" she murmured. \" Poor Bessie ! \" \" Well, don't waste too much pity on her : after all, she is pretty* content, since I made her a promise not to separate.

But at this moment of greatest terror his clasp suddenly relaxed ; and she tottered and nearly fell, as he withdrew his arms from her. Her first impulse at being free was to run away as quickly7 as possible; but her legs trembled too violently. She looked round for him, to say a quiet \" Good-bye.\" He was leaning against a tree \u2014 bent down : his hat still lying on the grass. Large tears were rolling through his fingers, which were pressed tightly on his eyes. She heard a low, sobbing groan, and saw that his whole frame shook. A new feeling arose : a woman's compassion moved her. \" John ! I will go and send for a carriage,\" she said. \" And you must drive to Hilton, and rest there and nurse yourself. Send for some one: for"], [257, "THE STOLEN INTERVIEW. 249 your sister or some one \u2014 or your brother, perhaps. You are ill, and need care ! \" He made no sort of answer. But he grew quieter. Then after some little time, he turned, took up his hat and put it on ; walked about a little, and smoothed back his hair. She stood watching, uncertain what to do or say. \" I am going directly,\" he said, in a mocking way. \" I 'U relieve you presently of my hated presence ! One thing first, though. Are you going to marry Vaughan, as they say ? \" \" No.\" \"Truly! And why not?

It was extraordinary how rapidly he fell into his ordinary manner and mode of speech. To Ellen it was a relief to see Sir Frederic de Lisle and his wife approaching. \" Mrs. Wentworth sent us on here, Miss Ray mond,\" said Sir Frederic. \" But, I fear,\" looking at John \u2014 \" I hope we don't disturb * \" My brother-in-law, Mr. Mortimer,\" Ellen said, calling up all her presence of mind, and introducing the new comers. \"Is your sketching finished?\" asked Lady Fred- eric. \" Yes ; for this morning : I was going to start home.\" \" Then we will walk back with you, and explain our errand as we go,\" said Sir Frederic, politely, but glancing at John, and at the signs of recent emotion which were visible in Ellen's face. She looked doubtingly at John. \" Well, as I must be back in town early to morrow, Ellen, I must say good-bye. Any mes sages for Bessie ? \" he asked ; and coming close to her, he took her hand, and for the first and last time in his life, pressed his hot lips to her sorehead. She dared not resist what appeared to her guests but a common brotherly parting. He wrung her hand again, and looked at her ; a gleam of triumph lighted up his face, but was quickly7 succeeded by a look of almost anguish ; and then with a low bow"], [259, "251 THE STOLEN INTERVIEW. to the others, he went off with a reckless, even defiant air, whistling a popular tune with rare precision. \"I fear you have heard bad news,\" remarked Lady de Lisle, as they all three turned into the wood path, the shortest cut to Blair. \" Yes : that is \u2014 I mean it is not very cheering. I believe my sister that they are all going to the Colonies,\" she said, hesitatingly. Sir Frederic remarked that every one was bitten with the emigration mania ; and plunged into de scriptions of the new country, then beginning to be known as something more than Botany Bay, the dreaded convict destination. The business that brought the De Lisles was to beg Mrs. Wentworth and Miss Raymond to come for two or three days, and lend their help to make a school fete go off well. Sir Frederic was enthu siastic about schools, and had some singular theories of his own. Mrs. Wentworth declined, pleading need of rest; and EUen settled to go alone, seeing, from her friend's manner, that she wished her to do so."], [260, "252 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XVIII.; THE DIGNITY OF MATRIMONY. The De Lisles had been man and wife for nearly two years. Sir Frederic had married a niece of Mrs. Edgehill's who was only nineteen, and, in conse quence, anxious to be important. So she assumed a few harmless airs of patronage towards unmarried young women, which highly amused EUen, who liked her, partly for her aunt Mrs. Edgehill's sake, and partly from the very opposition of their charac ters. Mrs. Wentworth indulged in a little sarcasm, which was apt to be sharper than quite kind. She called her the \" child-wife,\" and was fond of \" bring ing her out,\" as she called it; for Lady Frederic de Lisle had a strong fancy for recipes, and her great ambition and aim, at present, was to be a village doctress and oracle. She was an amiable, loving, little woman, and luckily had sweet temper enough to stand a great deal of \" snubbing,\" (there is no other word that will do for the brusque way in which her husband was wont to put her down) ; nor did she often detect the slight tone of irony which crept into his patronising caresses and praise."], [261, "THE DIGNITY OF MATRIMONY. 253 She looked np to and believed in him as a perfect hero, a model country gentleman, and the best authority on all subjects connected with taste and art He thought her very pretty, and was not dis appointed in his belief that he could lead her which way he chose : his criterion of a good wife, and chief motive in seeking her. Altogether, she suited him very well, and it was only in company that her want of sense ever annoyed him. Altogether, Ellen almost preferred them to any of the persons in the \" set \" they most frequently met. There was always something going on \u2014 some new project, some fresh invention, or startling theory, at Chorleigh: for Sir Frederic was a scientific model farmer, and all was activity and industry there. It was a relief, after the dull repetition of \"nothings \" which mostly prevailed in other grand houses, to visit Chorleigh. Sir Frederic's dogmatising egotism and his wife's inexhaustible list of \" certain cures,\" were lost sight of in the stir of action and life ; and in driving to see a famous crop produced by a certain treatment, or walking to the new improved dairy, drawing out models and plans, hearing really clever and interesting pamphlets on all practical subjects, Ellen soon lost the first stunning effects of John Mortimer's unexpected visit. At first she believed it impossible for her to go to Chorleigh. She needed absolute quiet to realise it all \u2014 to take home the long dreaded knowledge"], [262, "254 UPS AND DOWNS. that Bessie now knew the truth ; and although Ellen well knew how her heart must be breaking with this fatal knowledge, she could do nothing for her ! She dared not even write one word of sympathy. Those two, once so much to each other, were entirely divided now ! It little mattered how many miles more or less separated them. Yet, it was a miserable thought that she could not even see her, and say \" Good-bye.\" John's altered looks, the evident symptoms of suffering, also weighed on her. But it was a subject on which her friend Mrs. Went worth could bestow no sympathy : her remarks were positive pain to EUen. She thought it a good plan for them to emigrate : it freed Ellen from the unpleasant connection. She hoped now there was an end of \" The Mortimers ! \" She advised her to rub out the very name from her memory: it had never been anything but a cause of vexation, as far as she understood. There was no further occasion for any communication with any of them. \" You forget that my friend, that Miss Moore, is to be Mrs. Cecil Mortimer very soon,\" Ellen said, with a smile and a blush, and a slight tone of pique she could not altogether hide. \" Yes ; I did forget. I can't force myself to believe that you really got up such a schoolgirl, sudden friendship as all that. It is not like you, Lena ! However, when she is married she will drop the"], [263, "THE DIGNITY OF MATRIMONY. 255 correspondence, I devoutly hope. I can't conceive what interest her letters can be to you.\" \" I Uke to hear about the place and the people.\" \" You did not care for them so very much when there, however.

He has left Poole : they know nothing of him. No, no ! \" \" Lena, you vex me ! Indeed, you are provoking : you know you never did like these odious Mortimers. I really believe you set up for them now, merely to provoke me. I wish they were, one and all, any where \u2014 in Australia, for instance.\" This was all that had passed on the subject which weighed so heavUy on Ellen's heart. She was thinking of Bessie, Sir Frederic was reading the paper, and his little wife busying herself about the room, touching this and moving that. \"Miss Raymond,\" at last she said, \"I am sure, you are suffering from headache. I have observed how you press your hand on your forehead, and knit your brows. I have such a good receipt ; not bad to take at all.\" \" Your frisking about the room so is very bad for a headache,\" remarked Sir Frederic, gruffly. \" Do sit down, Rose ! It is such a worry to have your rustling petticoats and jingling chains always going!\""], [264, "256 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I beg your pardon ! But some one, we won't mention names, is very fond of marching up and down the room, too ! \" \" Aye, a regular walk ; but I never flirt here and there : besides, a man can walk without all that wretched bustle.\" \"Do let me bring you some anti-dolor mixture, my poor dear ! \" Rose said to Ellen. \" Thank you, but indeed I have no headache ; I was only thinking, I believe.\" \" Indeed ! Ah, well it is all from want of regular fixed duties, dear. I used to think so before I was married, and \" \" I am glad you have the grace to allow that y*ou don't do so now, at all events,\" remarked the husband. She only shook her head and long curls saucily at him, and then, with a good deal of assumed mat ron ly dignity, continued \u2014 \" Single people are always, \u2014 nearly always, so unoccupied, you see ! There is nothing like real work : it sends away so many pains and aches. I always so wish for every girl to get married. It is time for you to be thinking of it \u2014 isn't it ? But ah ! I forgot. Of course, you are thinking of it ; and I hope it will be soon too.\" \" I ! \u2014 thinking of being married ! \" exclaimed Ellen, half-affronted, half-amused. \" Rose, how you do chatter ! \" said her husband, with a warning look over the Times sheet."], [265, "THE DIGNITY OF MATRIMONY. 257 \" I beg your pardon ! Did I say anything so wrong ? But it is all over the country7. And I never can keep secrets. Everything will come out with me ! \" She laughed. \" You are wholly mistaken,\" EUen said, earnestly, but in a low voice. \" Am I, indeed ? I am sorry, then, very sorry ; for do you know \u2014 you won't be offended at my speaking honestly, will y7ou? \u2014 Aunt Edgehill and I both agree that marriage is just what you need. Every*one is improved by it. Of course, it is nature, and what we are intended for : single life is con trary to nature and all a mistake.\" '\u2022 Does not Mr. Damer live near here ? \" asked Ellen, presently. \" Yes ; Stockton Priors is our adjoining parish. And he has at last managed to establish a service, in a merely temporary building, for an1) unfortunate hamlet, \u2014 an outlying place, whicli is really nearer to us but nevertheless is in his parish. This brings him here once a week. He is a valuable, worthy man \u2014 an exceedingly sensible man. Have you heard about his schools, and his almshouses, and his cottage gardens?\" \u25a0 \" No,\" replied Ellen ; \" Mrs. Wentworth does not know them.\" \" Ah, I remember hearing some absurd scruple \u2014 as to who ought to make the first call, wasn't it ?

Then he had some awful trial, I forget exactly what, and he turned very grave and serious. Oh, he is so strict ! Uncle Edgehill thought him too strict, and was afraid of Ids going too far.\" \u00a9 \u00a9 \" Old people are always afraid of the rising generation,\" said her husband. \" But Damer is a good fellow*. It is wonderful what reforms he has brought in among the thick-skulled farmers, even in their way7 of manuring, &c. Dr. Edgehill and he would pull together very well if they were thrown together. Your uncle is a friend to reform, and, for his age, liberal enough.\" \"Frederic!\" \"Well, dear?\" \" Shall we ask the Damers here ? \u2014 quietly, y-ou know. I should like Miss Raymoud to meet them.\" \" By all means, certainly ; if Miss Raymond has no objection.\" \" I should particularly like it.

My dear, I shall be absent to-morrow at the agricultural committee meeting, to settle the accounts. The carriage will, of course, be at your command.\" \" WeU, I will see what we can do ; but married women cannot always be sure, you see: so many interruptions ; not an hour one's very* own ! So different ! \" and the little lady gave a sigh to the heavy burdens of matrimony, while a slight curl of the Up and toss of the ringletted head spoke also of its honours. When they separated in the hall, she could not refrain from bestowing a word of pity on Ellen, for having all but attained the age of twenty-one, and being still unmarried. \" As if I wasn't ten times more independent and my own mistress as I am,\" said Ellen, evading the patronizing pat on the shoulder which was offered. \"Ah! but it is not natural, it is not feminine, to be independent. But I know \u2014 I know all about it ! You will soon be a slave of the ring. You can't deny it ! No ! Good-night.\" And she danced off to her room in a manner betraying utter forgetful ness for the moment of all the dignity befitting a \" married lady.\" S 2"], [268, "260 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XIX. A FRIEND'S FRIENDS. During Ellen's visit, she had the satisfaction of becoming acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Damer, who dined one clay at Chorleigh. She was an elegant woman, wdth just a touch of abruptness or independence and indifference to other's opinions, whicli in another of less slight and graceful pro portions, might have been called unfeminine. As it was, Ellen was disappointed hi her, and did not find her at all \" taking.\" But Sir Frederic said she was one who improved on further acquaintance, and, in fact, required to be be well known to be appreciated. He pronounced her an \" admirable, high-minded woman,\" and exactly suited to her posi tion as \" Darner's wife.\" Towards him, EUen found herself much attracted. She had only met him, to speak to, once before, and that was in Mrs. Legard's dying hour. He claimed her acquaintance at once, with a peculiarly pleasant well-bred manner. He was somewhat above the middle height, very thin, and his face particularly7 sallow and hollow,"], [269, "A friend's friends. 261 with a saddened expression, which kept down his natural vivacity, and veiled a very winning smile. EUen could fancy that what she had heard of him was true : that his former life had left marks behind ; and that his energy and activity had not always been turned to those subjects which now claimed his whole soul. His manner and style of conversation impressed a listener at once with the belief that he was a man who had mixed in the gay world : that his natural tastes and impulses were often opposed by his principles ; but it lest a tone of sympathy, a capability of entering into another's mind and views, which gave him great influence. With him, at least at first sight, there was no stern, unbending resistance to opinions different from his own. There was a roundness, a polish, which, perhaps, can only be attained by friction in \" the world,\" and by being early accustomed to judge of men in the mass rather than one narrow and exclusive circle. He took Ellen down to dinner, and as he talked freely and pleasantly7 on various subjects, she won dered what kept Mrs. Wentworth so divided from them, and felt sure that if they once met, the preju dice must be removed. Once, in a pause of the more general conversation, he said to Ellen, \" By the way, do you know, Miss Raymond, I have been rather curious to see you ? \" \" You heard Mrs. Legard speak of me.\""], [270, "262 UPS AND DOWNS. \" No ! At least, that was not so much the reason as another. My best friend, a connection of yours, Granville Mortimer \" \" Yes ; I know he is a friend of yours,\" Ellen put in, nervously, and interrupting what she wanted above all things to hear. \" He talked so much of y7our and his sister \u2014 his beau ideal of a wife ! She must really be a very charming person. You are twins, I believe ? \" \" Yes. But,\" answering- a keen enquiring glance of his eye, she added, \" we are not the least alike : perfect opposites in everything.\" \" Indeed ! \" and he looked again at her with a slight smile. Then they were both appealed to by the others, and an animated discussion arose shortly about University life, and what was the best prepara tion for it \u2014 whether a public school or private tuition. Sir Frederic was in favour of the latter, and so was the only other gentleman, a Mr. Samley. t \" I only knew one exception, and that only partly so,\" he said. \" Certainly he had not been at a public school, and, though not in attainments, to a certain degree, he showed the want of it, too. It gave a sensitive \u2014 a morbid cast to his temper, which interfered with his success and popularity*. I allude,\" he added, lowering his voice to EUen and leaving the others to bring up their examples, \" to Mortimer. He was undoubtedly the cleverest, that is, the most able man in my time. Have you observed"], [271, "A FRIEND'S FRIENDS. 263 what I mean \u2014 a certain sensitiveness \u2014 a soreness, sometimes leading to undue depression ? \" \" I have seen so little of him since he went abroad,\" she answered, with hesitation ; \" but certainly,\" she added, with her amused smile, \" take them as a family, that is not one of their character istics. A good, comfortable opinion of self rather, and a proneness to judge others hardly.\" \" Yes ; I see what you mean. It has been thought so of my friend ; but never was there a greater mistake. It is all outside manner, and really pro ceeds from lack of due self-confidence. That is what a man loses from not being at a public school : a rule of measurement which allows one to be a tolerable correct judge of one's own powers, alike removed from conceit or false humility. That un certainty which a more confined field limits a man to is bad. Sometimes mediocre abilities are exaggerated into great ones, from want of opportunity to com pare \u2014 sometimes the reverse.\" \" Doesn't it partly depend on the natural temper ? Surely it is partly physical, \u2014 that easy pleasant self-confidence ; or its opposite, a miserable self doubt?\" Again their teteAi-tete was interrupted, and Mr. Darner's opinion was asked about some parochial scheme, on which Sir Frederic was greatly set just now. When the ladies were in the drawing-room,"], [272, "264 UPS AND DOWNS. Mrs. Damer threw herself upon a couch in a quiet, independent fashion, appearing fully as much at her ease as if she was alone in her own chamber. She did not trouble herself to find conversation, and returned curt answers to Lady Frederic's remarks. To EUen she did not address herself once, and Ellen silently settled that Mrs. Wentworth and Mrs. Damer were best apart. They would not suit at all ! She was looking at Mrs. Darner's well-shaped head, and wondering what about her had attracted such a \u00a9 man as her husband, when suddenly over Mrs. Darner's grave countenance beamed a look of singular beauty. A slow smile, or it was more like a light graduaUy spread over the whole face, touching the hitherto stiff mouth, till the lips curled. Follow ing the direction of her eyes, Ellen looked towards the door, and then discovered the cause in the husband's presence. Mr. Damer was standing at the open door. He came quickly up to his wife and pushing aside her dress, took a scat by her. He did not, however, say anything till, turning half round to where Ellen sat before a small table, on which stood a beautiful vase of flowers, he remarked \u2014 \" My dear, I was speaking to Miss Raymond of Mortimer's admiration of her sister ; she says they are not at all alike.\" \" I knew that,\" Mrs. Damer said. \"How?\" \" Oh, one glance at Miss Raymond would tell one"], [273, "A friend's friends. 265 that she did not answer to Mr, Mortimer's account of his brother's wife ! \" Mr. Damer laughed and looked at Ellen. \" My wife pretends to be a great judge of physi ognomy, Miss Raymond. But, Harriet, are you quite sure that in one of your many confidential talks with him, Mortimer gave you no other description ; no clue, in fact, to his sister-in-law's sister ? \" \" Quite sure. I asked him, but he turned the subject.\" Ellen's colour flushed up at this. Something in the lady's manner annoyed her ; she felt inclined to say something sharp and haughty7. But Mr. Damer bent over the sofa cushion, and raising his hand, as if to prevent his wife's hearing, he said \u2014 \" Between ourselves, my wife is rather sensitive on this subject. It is a sore point. Once, Mortimer, out of his regard for me, ventured to give Mrs. o \u25a0* \u00a9 Damer a friendly hint about a wife's duties ; and, in fact, your sister's name became rather like the good child who stands bugbear in the nursery so often.\" \" Hint, indeed ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Damer, with a heightened colour, but smiling too. \" It was something more than a hint. He gave me a right down lecture, I can tell you.\" \"A lecture? \" asked Ellen, catching the infection of Mrs. Darner's laugh, and amused in spite of herself, at the spirit and frankness of the wife's animated account."], [274, "266 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Yes ; a lecture on speaking deferentially and respectfully to my lord and master. Oh, Mr. Mor timer has sundry cut and dried theories of his own. Among them is his model of a wife; all gentle humility, loving reverence, and so on. My free and easy7 style shocked him \u2014 because I ventured to contradict WiUiam, and held an opinion of my own.\" \" Why, surely, Mrs. Damer, you don't mean to uphold disobedience in a wife ? \" put in Sir Frederic, as he sipped his tea. \" Perhaps not in general,\" she replied. \" For my self I object to the virtue strongly, and I made it an express stipulation, that I should not be required to possess it. I didn't promise it : I would not say the word.\" There was of course a general laugh, and much badinage on this avowal, very coolly* taken by the lady; and then, being asked by Lady Frederic to sing, she allowed her husband to lead her to the piano forte, and place her music. She sang well, but only in one stvle \u2014 sacred music. Mr. Damer returned to Ellen. \" I was hoping to see Mortimer here very soon ; but he says he is too busy. He seems to be satis fied with his work ; but I confess I am greatly- dis appointed. He was made for something better : he ought to have been ordained, Miss Raymond.\" \"I can easilv believe that the very fact of a good"], [275, "A friend's friends. 267 living being ready for him had the effect of keepin o him back,\" said EUen. \" Ah ! I understand \u2014 yes ! It would make him exaggerate the difficulties and obstacles. Though how little your remark would be understood by almost every one you meet ! I am, however, the more sorry,\" he added, presently, having paused to listen to one of his wife's swelling sostenuto notes, \" the more grieved, because I know all his real doubts had vanished. His convictions were honestly such as to enable him to propose himself as a candidate. It was vexing. I can't make out what it was. Was there any family trouble just as he returned home? \" \"None that I am aware of. But I really \u2014 strange to say, I am ignorant about much it would be but natural I should know. I saw so little, that is \u2014 - \u2014 \" she stopped, in evident confusion. But her companion went on, apparently unobservant. \" He s-^id he could not command that quiet, calm state of mind which he considered essential to prepare himself. Something had disturbed and upset him seriously7. And then, so suddenly he seemed to accept this offer of acting daily tutor to an invalid noble man: perhaps an interesting and not ungenial occupation, and affording means for his continuing his literary work. Yet, it is not what I desired for him. A lonely, contemplative life in a London lodging is not what he needs. His last letter amused my wife much. He has, it seems, picked up some young"], [276, "268 UPS AND DOWNS. person, a relation of his landlady, who is intel lectually inclined, and he actually directs her studies, and reads French to her to give her an accent. Philanthropic ! Fancy my friend Mortimer, with his gravity and reserve, acting tutor to a girl, a ' grisette ! ' Of course she is pretty, and \" \" Yes, she is pretty,\" Ellen said, quickly. \" She is a daily governess, but was thrown out of work by iUness. I knew her very well. She was a pupil of mine: in fact, I have known her for years. She lived at Poole, and \" \" Oh ! indeed ! of course that accounts for it, and wdiolly alters the case ! Harriet ! do you hear?\" he said \u2014 his manner giving the notion, that it had been a subject of discussion already \u2014 as his wife returned to her former seat. \" The young lady about whom y*ou were so curious \u2014 Mortimer's pupil, you know, is a Poole girl ; comes from his native town, and was known to him as a scholar of Miss Raymond's \u2014 now a daily governess.\" \" WeU ? \" was his wife's remark in a tone wliich meant much, as she looked from Ellen to her husband. \"Well!\" he repeated. \"Simply it alters the case,\" and here the subject dropped : although Ellen's curiosity was a little excited to know what they* had before thought of it. It was now Ellen's turn to sing and to play ; and she had no more conversation with the Darners. When saying \" Good-night,\" Mr. Damer said he"], [277, "A friend's friends. 269 hoped, now they had met, they might do so again ; something else he was about to add, but his wife stopped it by saying in her cool, off-hand way, \u2014 \" Busy people have not time to meet gay and idle folks ; our paths are not likely to meet, Miss Ray mond.\" Then, with a twinkling of fun in her eye, and looking up at her husband she added, demurely, \"If it was Miss Raymond's sister, William \u2014 the model wife, it might alter the case ! But to be frank, I doubt if I should learn Mr. Mortimer's lessons from Miss Raymond.\" Then with a graceful bow and a bright smile, which softened any offence her words might give, Mrs. Damer passed 'out with her hand on her husband's arm; having declined Sir Frederic's offered assistance, saying \u2014 William alway cloaked her for theh drive and she would say good-night to Sir Frederic there. \" A character, certainly ! \" was little Lady Fred eric's remark, as she bustled about putting away the music, &c. \" A very clever woman, but sharp, certainly. Has a will of her own,\" remarked the husband. \" I should think so ! He dares not say which sermon he will preach,\" .added Lady Frederic. \" I wonder,\" said Ellen, \" why they did not call at Blair? I should fancy Mrs. Wentworth would suit Mr. Damer.\" \"But not his wife. Depend upon it she said,"], [278, "270 UPS AND DOWNS. ' No.' She is exceedingly sharp on any lady attract ing attention \u2014 any beautiful woman, like Mrs. Went worth, for instance. You need not frown at me, Frederic,\" she said, turning to her husband, with a nod in return for a look of warning ; \" I am not saying any harm. Miss Raymond, of course, knows as well as we do that Mrs. Wentworth has been naturally much talked of, being so beautiful and agreeable and so rich, and all that ; and that she has had hosts of admirers, and some few enemies. And Mrs. Damer is very strict and stern : much more so than he is. I know it was her doing, their not calling when Mrs. Wentworth returned : she said she did not mean herself or her husband to waste time in worshipping an idol ; and, as a clergy man, it would be encouraging evil to visit a house where such a disorderly establishment was allowed. You know at one tune, before you came, Miss Ray mond, really* things were rather strange at Blah ; and I know when my uncle and aunt spoke, Mrs. Wentworth said she couldn't help it: she couldn't prevent it \u2014 she could not send away so valuable a man as her head butler.\" \" Come, come, Rose, don't begin upon household subjects, pray,\" her husband \" Is Mrs. Damer liked ?\" asked Ellen. \" Oh, no,\" repUed Lady Frederic ; \" only when well known.

I don't"], [279, "A friend's friends. 271 wonder at that gentleman's lecture at all, for, I assure you, I have heard her speak most dreadfully to her husband ; and yet he is so attentive and so fond of her.

The fact is, she is too clever. It is a mistake : a man doesn't want clever ness in a wife.\" \" Thank you ! That means I am either silly, I suppose, or that I should be so. Good night ! After that, Miss Raymond, we are bound to leave him till he is in a more civil humour.\" Lady Frederic opened the door for Ellen, and gave her a light ; whispering loud, that some people were very rude and sulky to-night : but she lingered behind for a moment, and stooping over him gave her husband a kiss on his temple as he bent over his book. He looked up to return it, and told her she was worth twenty clever women, Mrs. Darners and all ; and when the little lady overtook Ellen on her way up-stairs, she was in such light spirits, that Ellen had the benefit of an extra amount of matri monial patronage and good-natured pity. \" You seem quite tired, dear. I am as fresh as possible ! It is all from having one's mind filled with wholesome duties. Ah ! you will find all this lan guor and weariness will go off.

I prefer independence.\" Ellen was glad to see Lady Frederic show symp toms of fatigue at last, in a hardly7-to-he-suppressed yawn, and shaking hands again they parted.

Mr. Vaughan had evidently been looking out for the carriage ; and very pleasant was his joyous and kind voice as he shook Ellen's hand in his own hearty fashion, and vowed it was a month since he had seen her, instead of a week. To her question how was Mrs. Wentworth, he said, \u2014 \" Pretty fairly ! rather moping \u2014 and \u2014 I suspect she has been bothered again by some letters with a portentous coat-of-arms seal.\" \" Mr. St. Clare, I suppose ! \" \"Perhaps: indeed, now you mention it, I have little doubt, that it is from that quarter \u2014 but \u2014 how impatient the horses are!

I should detest it alone, with no sympathy but the gardener's ; but on the strength of this promise, I am looking forward to it with pleasure.\" \" You certainly are a sociable person \u2014 gregarious, in fact,\" Ellen said. \" Now, I can fancy growing so fond of such pursuits, as to care for no company hut one's own thoughts.

But I don't think you are one of those who blindly do the very wrong thing. Enough to provoke a Job himself sometimes, are these condescending attempts of good, well-disciplined persons.

Then he continued more seriously, \" It is so strange to me, when I see two people, who fancy they really like and under stand each other, just doing and saying the very thing which most irritates. Surely real love or liking would find out the road to sympathy.\" \" Some people can't sympathise.

I suppose that not only is it a peculiar gift of temper, like gentleness, but that it is also one of our highest attainments as Christians. The better a person is, the more he should be able to give sympathy ; and we can find none so great as His who became man on purpose to know our infirmities : only it is so difficult to remember this \u2014 strangely difficult. \" You are learning the lesson ? \" he asked, in a tone of peculiar tenderness and delicacy. \" Oh, very, very imperfectly7.

There were two letters : one was her milliner's bill ; the other gave her a little start, for she knew* the writing, though it was disguised by a blotty pen, and evidently shaking hand. It was from John Mortimer, dated from Hilton, and it must have been there since the day she left. The colour came and went, and an expression of trouble gathered in her face, as she read the letter. \" I am sure I don't know how I am to do it,\" she exclaimed to herself, presently, while a look of great perplexity gathered in her face. This was the letter : \u2014 \" Dear Nellie, \" I can't think for the life of me how I could be such a blockhead ! for, after all, the real object of my journey and visit remained untold.

I think a temporary fit of insanity or delirium possessed me. I have a confused idea that I made a great fool of myself. Well \u2014 truth is, I am 'unstrung,' as an old patient of mine used to say \u2014 an expressive expression by the by.

But a truce to nonsense and sense or sentiment ; and to business. Business ! quotha, that's the word : my word in future !

Bessie washing and baking dampers, and grow- ing brown and bony ? Well \u2014 but to arrive at this heaven on earth, this paradise, this Utopia, hard cash is needed, and I am deuced hard-up. Like a self-devoted, highly exemplary wife and matron as she is, Bessie brings forth her jewels, and with a smile and an air I need not describe, begs me, her unfortu- nate husband, to make use of them ; in plain English, turn the pearls into hard gold or silver. Well ! they journeyed in my pocket, and I visited the great Jew jewellers \u2014 and poked my nose in at several doors, when I bethought me of the last time I had seen these very pearls, i.e., in your hair! Excuse me if I say, they were beautiful, and that it was hard to say which set off the other most, the hair the pearls or the pearls the hair. I further remembered that these fishy gems were your respected mother's property, and as such I concluded of great and inestimable value (in a way* dull clods like myseU can't comprehend) to her children. I also took counsel, and remembered that, though one of these children was very poor indeed* the other was passing rich, and reputed heiress of a"], [287, "279 DEBTOR AND CREDITOR. good fortune. So, being not altogether the churl some folks think, I thought it would be well to offer these pearls belonging to the poor daughter, to the rich daughter. Surely she will like to save such precious heirlooms, to say nothing of such becoming ornaments, from the greasy paw of a London Jew, a skinflint. She will incline to come down generously, giving a fancy price for the gems, glad to assist her poor relations, and at the same time do honour to her parent's memory7, and secure a costly family \u2014 a ' Raymond,' ornament for her fair self \u2014 am I right ? If so, give me a cheque for the enclosed sum and the pearls are yours. Allow me to add, that in so doing, ' you wdl be aiding the truly distressed,' in beggars' jargon. Come NeU! fork out. You wiU never feel it. It is the last time you will ever be bothered by your true, profound admirer, and your dutiful, hard-up, feverish, thirsty, tired-of-life, wretched rascal of a brother ! \" John.\" Some time before, Ellen would have at once given up the idea of paying so much for any jewel what ever. But the idea had become familiar to her now, that she was to be her friend's heiress ; and these pearls, besides the association which belonged to them, as some of her mother's family jewels, recalled to EUen a proud moment, when, twisted in her hair by Bessie, they had been greatly admired by Gran ville, and formed the subject of some pretty and"], [288, "280 UPS AND DOWNS. graceful lines. She did therefore grudge their passing into strange hands ; and knowing how little her friend thought of purchasing a far more costly set of jewels than even these, she pondered and considered before refusing the offer. Since the rupture with the Clares, Mrs. Went worth had spoken very decidedly* and openly every where ; and had even introduced Ellen to her friends as her adopted child and heiress, also to her servants and tenants. A small slice of her landed property alone went to a distant relation of her husband. She herself had no nearer relation than Mrs. Clare; and whatever might have been her claims before, the quarrel had completely estranged them ; thus since they had come into possession of a good living in an unexpected way, Mrs. Wentworth had no scruple in cutting them out altogether, and declaring her intention in favour of her favourite and adopted child. She laughingly said that she should like to make the taking her name, a condition ; but, out of love and respect for her old friends the Raymonds, she would not do so. It was a good name : \"Though\" she added, with a smile, \" after all it is another name I desire to know for my successor, beginning with a letter further down the alphabet \u2014 you know \u2014 eh, Ellen?\" All this, well remembered, now inclined EUen to ask the loan of the required sum. She hardly* had a scruple ; for she was sure that her friend would"], [289, "DEBTOR AND CREDITOR. 281 only be too glad to rescue the Raymond pearls. It was therefore with a clear brow and light heart, that she rejoined Mr. Vaughan ; having almost for gotten him, while puzzling over her strange letter. \" The letters were important, apparently,\" he re marked : \" nothing unpleasant, I hope ? \" \" Not exactly, though at first it seemed so. I do so hate all money concerns, and this is to ask me for what seems to me an immense sum.\" She told him what it was. \" And what do you propose ? \" he asked, with interest. \" Oh, I shall beg Worthy to lend it to me ! You know next month I shall be of age, and can draw all my fortune \u2014 all that is left, that is. They are lovely pearls ; and, of course, being poor mamma's, and all that, I am sure \u2014 I think, at least, Worthy won't refuse. Do you think she will?\" \" Not willingly. But it is just possible : in fact, I happen to know, that from various causes, Mrs. Wentworth's treasury is rather empty at this present time. She was consulting me the other day. She has many large payments to make, and two principal tenants failed ; and that fete cost no trifle. Two hundred pounds is not always to be had in a moment by unfortunate landed proprietors, you see. But,\" he added, seeing her rather blank face, \" why \u2014 why should not one friend do as well as another? It happens that a sum rather larger than what you"], [290, "282 UrS AND DOWNS. require is lying at this moment useless in the bank. Let me \u2014 let me \" \" Perhaps I might ask you to lend it to me,\" she said, gravely, and laying a stress on the word \" lend.\" \" Then it is settled,\" he answered, joyfully. \" Don't tease Mrs. Wentworth about it at all. She won't like to refuse. It will be doing me a favour : treating me as a friend, in fact.\" \" Thank you, heartily ! Yet I had rather ask Worthy first, if you please. She would not like it if I did not ; and it seems the right and natural way.\" ss Here the subject dropped. Mrs. Wentworth sent for EUen, and Mr. Vaughan took his leave. During dinner Ellen amused her friend with an account of her visit, and took off the little Miss Armidales, with perhaps rather more spirit and cleverness than perfect good-nature. And so she felt herself; for she stopped short, with a flushed face, saying it was quite too bad of her, and after all, though it was easy to imitate their little oddities, it was impossible even to describe their goodness. But Mrs. Wentworth maintained that if people would be odd, they must expect to be laughed at, \" it was all such originals were fit for, to make others laugh.\" But Ellen's spirit was gone, and when they retired"], [291, "DEBTOR AND CREDITOR. 283 to the drawing-room, she unfolded John's letter, and with a half-comical, half-grave face, laid it before Mrs. Wentworth. \"Pooh!\" at last she said, lay-ing it down with a face and gesture of intense disgust. \" Why did you show me anything so very, very terrible ? Of course, I always looked on poor Bessie's match as a \u25a0mesalliance, but really I was not aware of the ex treme vulgarity and coarseness of this ! Pray, take no notice of it. Thank Heaven the wretched man did not stay here ! I am sure if I had guessed at all, I never would have directed him where to find yrou that day.\" \" This letter,\" said EUen, \" is very had \u2014 in fact, the very worst he could make of himself It is reckless ; aud all that unpleasant joking strain is utterly forced. I fear it is too true that they are in great need of money. I do believe that he is fitted for the enterprising life of the colonies, and will be another man from what he has been at that horrid Poole. And then \u2014 the pearls ! surely you must remember them ? They are reckoned splendid, and were mamma's favourite ornaments.\" \" They were fine enough,\" Mrs Wentworth re marked, indifferently. \" But I have still finer ; and if you have patience, you know, Ellen, all mine will be yours. Meanwhile, to console you for the loss of this set, I will let out a secret : namely7, that a very pretty necklace, bracelets, and strings for"], [292, "284 ITS AND DOWNS. the hair, are already on the way for you \u2014 some of my own spare ones which I sent to be reset. Now, pray, dismiss that wretched letter from your mind, my dear ! It is wholly impossible for you to give the money7 : a mere fancy price. As for me, if you think I can, I assure you I have not got it : I am a good deal pressed just now. Indeed, I believe, that alone will make it imperative for us to winter abroad. I shall shut up this place and dismiss all the servants : you will enjoy foreign life, I know. WeU, you don't look particularly cheerful at the prospects, I must say,\" she added, rather fretfully ; \" but, indeed, I can't stand this place. I dislike it more and more. It is all so cold, so chilling ; and then I never now go into my garden in peace : I am always dreading the sight of that man \u2014 that dreadful face ! \" and she shivered a little and took up her book. EUen was uncomfortable. She particularly dis liked teasing her friend, or saying anything which Mrs. Wentworth did not like. Yet she must tell her of Mr. Vaughan's offer, or she would be yet more displeased. She accordingly attempted to introduce the subject, but was peremptorily told not to speak of it again. \" After all, the pearls were not worth that sum, and there was no reason for giving so much to such a creature : one who had, by Ellen's own con fessions, not scrupled to draw on her small fortune in a shameful way. You havn't got it, neither have I;"], [293, "DEBTOR AND CREDITOR. 285 and if I had, I would not give it to him : so, pray, child, dismiss it altogether, and don't give me the shivers with that rueful face of yours.\" There was an uncomfortable rising in Ellen's throat, though she checked it. But this was scarcely like the full and perfect sympathy she had looked and longed for ! It was, however, the same in every thing, when Ellen required comfort and affection. She could not help sighing over this disposition (for she would not even to herself call it selfishness) which required all and gave only7 what she liked. She contrasted it with Mr. Vaughan's ever ready and quick sympathy, and determined \u2014 it must be owned a httle under the influence of resentment or wounded feeling \u2014 to accept his offer, and trust to opportunity and chance for letting Mrs. Wentworth know it. Nor had she any difficulty ; for, with a parcel of new foreign books for Mrs. Wentworth sent by Mr. Vaughan, there was also a note for EUen, repeating his offer, and, in fact, enclosing a cheque for the required sum. She sent it to John at once and without farther thought, and in course, of time received the case of pearls. Directly they arrived she showed them to Mrs. Wentworth, hoping she had chosen a good moment, when she had been carried back to her old memories of the Abbey, and tears actually stood in her eyes, while she spoke of them. \" You don't mean that you have got these pearls"], [294, "286 UPS AND DOWNS. after all, Ellen ! \" she exclaimed, with sudden change of voice. \" And, pray, how ? Did he give them up to you?\" \" No, Mr. Vaughan was so very kind. I couldn't refuse without hurting him. He lent me the sum.\" \" Lent you the sum ! \u2014 lent you two hundred pounds ! And, pray, how do you intend to repay him ? Or, perhaps \u2014 I suppose it is to go down to the jointure ? eh ? Well, Ellen ! I didn't think matters had gone so far as this between you ! You have taken care to keep it very close, I think ! \" \" What \u2014 what can you mean ? \" said EUen, dis tressed at her tone of irony and anger. \" Why, of course you are \u2014 you can't be less than engaged? Even then, I doubt the propriety of such a step. But nothing short of an engagement could possibly justify it.\" \" We are not dreaming of such a thing ; it is simply a kind act of friendship. But for this, do you suppose I would have accepted his offer ? \" \" Very pretty ! You are not dreaming? Well ! he is, or I am much mistaken: or rather I think he is very wide awake, and knows what he is about, and that this affair must end only one way, unless it seriously7 compromises your discretion. And my poor offering of pearls, too, which I expect daily ! They7, of course, are not worth your acceptance ! The ' Raymond' pearls cut them out. Well, well, I own I am keenly hurt \u2014 surprised and hurt\""], [295, "DEBTOR AND CREDITOR. 287 And she showed her displeasure by keeping her own room for the rest of that day, and most of the next ; saying she had a headache. Ellen could gain no admittance. Watkins looked, she thought, mali ciously triumphant, though she bestowed civil words and courtesies, and lamented her dear lady's \"dejec tion and nerves,\" volubly. Ellen was in no comfortable state : Mrs. Went worth's anger distressed her very much. Something of the old feeling of standing alone, and of being misunderstood, came over her. But there was a difference. Instead of tossing her head, and harden ing herself against everything and everybody, she now strove hard to accept it as a trial, ancl to meet it with gentleness and patience. Moreover, something better and more durable than her own pleasure and happiness was now the object of life. She sighed for the friend who had so comforted her, and had always lifted her mind above the trial of the hour. She did wish she could drive or walk to Mrs. Legard, and regretted that calm, peaceful room, where she had spent so many happy moments. Then she roused herself to begin her set occupations, remembering her lost friend's words \" that regularity even in little things, where there were no higher duties, helped the mind to composure and discipline.\" Mr. Vaughan did not come. He was absent from home; and after Mrs. Wentworth's sharp remarks, Ellen felt glad not to meet him."], [296, "288 UPS AND DOWNS. A hurried letter from Bessie spoke of John's being ill, and his wife and children, three in number, now setting off, without much notice, to join him in town. Bessie's letters were never famous for clear- ness, either of writing or diction ; but this one was more than commonly a puzzle, and whether she alluded to their proposed emigration, or w-hat, Ellen could not at all understand. She was not surprised to hear of the illness, and was glad that his wife was with him. She was not quite comfortable about the state of things at Mrs. Harding's. Hetty wrote in mad spirits, and every line showed how the child had developed prematurely into the young woman \u2014 the voung woman of the world, or \" society.\" The occa sional allusions to Ruth being weak and ailing, and always too tired for any fun, and her being more than ever dismal and homesick, made EUen long to have the power of seeing her, and judging for herself as to the poor child's real state of health : she hit on an expedient at last, whicli was the next best thing to seeing with her own eyes. Hear ing from their old nurse, with whom she kept up a correspondence, that she was living not far from B , Ellen enclosed a post-office order for the expense of the journey, and begged her to go to Landsdowne Villa and see the children. Nurse did so, and then wrote to Ellen her account : \" Miss Hetty was sprung up into a very fine young lady7,"], [297, "DEBTOR AND CREDITOR. 289 indeed \u2014 quite handsome, and with such an air about her, and plenty of spirits ! But she couldn't say so much for poor Miss Ruth, who looked very sadly indeed, and seemed quite overcome at seeing Nurse, and cried a great deal, and wished she could go home. But Mrs. Harding \u2014 who was extremely khid and affable, and had made her (Nurse) very wel come, and talked quite kind and pleasant about the young ladies \u2014 only said, it was the growing so fast which made Miss Ruth weakly7, and that she was taking medicine which would be sure to give her strength, and that the less she saw of people or received letters to remind her of home, the better. Ellen was utterly powerless to afford any help to her little sister. From her father she never heard ; and she never wrote to him. Mrs. Went worth did not offer, and Ellen dared not ask, to have poor Ruth at Blair. At school she must stay, then, now that Bessie's home was broken up. It weighed on Ellen's mind, and prevented her from entering with any real zeal into the preparations for their foreign sojourn, which now began to occupy Mrs. Wentworth in earnest. So things went on: not over bright, for Mrs. Wentworth continued to be out of sorts, low and nervous ; nor had she quite forgiven Ellen. VOL. II. D"], [298, "290 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XXI. THE SUMMONS. It was October. Blah had been full of guests for the shooting season. Mrs. Wentworth was wont for the time to fill her house chiefly with men from London, to whom a day or a week's holiday is a boon beyond description. A few chosen people were invited for the very late dinner which wound up the day. It was the kind of party she enjoyed and understood how to manage to perfection. It did her good, too ; and she spoke more' in her usual tone to Ellen, and was rather less full of ' nerve ' as Watkins called it. A party was talked of for celebrating Ellen's twenty-first birthday which w*as at hand. EUen was surprised at receiving no remittance as usual from her father, and at hearing nothing about her own money being given up to her. Neither had she heard again from Bessie. But her Poole correspondent, Miss Moore, now Mrs. Cecil Mortimer, spoke of John and his wife being"], [299, "THE SUMMONS. 291 at Boulogne. Mrs. C. Mortimer feared his health was precarious, and that he found more difficulty than lie had expected in emigrating. She said that her husband, suspecting pecuniary difficulty, had written proposing help ; but that no answer had been given. Many more debts were left at Poole than his effects there could possibly- clear. They tried to keep it all a secret from his poor mother, who had felt his leaving very acutely; and who, although she was quite wonderfully well, needed the greatest care and freedom from all shock or excitement. She added, what Ellen smiled half-incredulously at \u2014 that no woman could have better or more devoted children, and that beneath even Miss Mortimer's brusque manner, there was an unceasing, watchful care for her mother. In fact, it was very evident that Cecil's wife had become a true \" Mortimer,\" Ellen said to herself, in as far as upholding and praising the family went. There was a happy spirit in all she said, a tone of quiet content, with allusions to her fully occupied time (occupied with real, not made-up work,) whicli EUen could not but contrast with herself. Dinner was over, and Mrs. Wentworth and Ellen were standing in a back hall, looking at some traveUing boxes, which they had ordered from the village carpenter, and for which Ellen had drawn models, meaning them to be something peculiarly convenient. Mrs. Wentworth drew her shawl tight u 2"], [300, "292 UPS AND DOWNS. round her, and said it was chilly ; the sooner they were off the better, to avoid all the autumnal damp and fogs. \"If you please, ma'am,\" said the butler, \"Mr. Mortimer is in the study. He desired me to an nounce him to you and to Miss Raymond and to beg an audience.\" Something in the man's manner annoyed Ellen. The fact was, Mrs. Wentworth was very indiscreet, and very apt to talk freely7 of her likings and dis likes before her attendants. Ellen had chafed at this more than once ; for she could see the veiled inso lence which to the mistress was skilfully- hidden by an exaggerated devotion of manner which they7 quickly learnt to be pleasing to her. The name of ' Mortimer,' was well known in the household as one not approved of. At the man's mention of the name now, Ellen, believing it to be John, changed colour, and found no voice to ask a word. \"Mr. Mortimer!\" repeated Mrs. Wentworth. \" The one who was here a short time ago ? \u2014 John \u00a9 Mortimer?\" \" This is his card, ma'am.\" \" Granville Mortimer ! \" read Mrs. Wentworth, and looking full at EUen \u2014 as much as to say- \u2014 \"Did you know of this ? \" \" At this time of day, too ! \u2014 Really : it is strange \u2014 rather unaccountable. Pray, did he say what brought him ; from whence he came, or where he is staving?\""], [301, "THE SUMMONS. 293 \" He merely bade me give the card aud say he wished to see the ladies, ma'am.\" \"Cool!\" \" I wonder what can have have brought him,\" exclaimed Ellen, a curious thrill of surprise and of fear seizing Uer. \"Perhaps he has brought bad news. You will come, won't you ? \" she asked Mrs. Wentworth. \"No; I really do not see that I am called on to do so. He cannot wish or expect to see me. 1 suppose his visit is to you,\" she answered, coldly and haughtily. \" The gentleman said he wished to speak to Miss Raymond. Indeed, he asked at first whether she were at home or not,\" and again the butler glanced aside with drooping eyes towards EUen, and there was a slight curl of mischief in his mouth. Ellen frowned and drew up. She would not ask her friend to come again, disliking any discussion before the butler ; yet in her heart she felt very shy, and she had a great longing to run fairly away to escape the inter view. Very inconsistent this was ; for at another moment, such an opportunity might, in her own secret mind, have appeared only too desirable. \" Pray, go, EUen \u2014 or he will be obliged to sleep here : it is getting dark now ! WeU ! talk of cool confidence\u2014 some people have enough. The next thing will be the Damers coining to lunch, self invited \u2014 an inroad of Goths ancl Visigoths ! \" and"], [302, "294 UPS AND DOWNS. she tried to get up a laugh, but could not lude her annoyance. Ellen looked at her again with half-entreaty7, really wishing for the shelter of presence. \" Don't pretend to be shy. Come ! go, go, EUen ! Give him a dignified reception, and don't be romanc ing. Really you don't seem over-pleased at this bold stroke.\" Ellin was gone before the last word was uttered. He was standing by the window, his hand on his head, as if thinking. It was very dim and dark, but the outline of his figure wras shown in strong relief \u00a9 \u00a9 against the gray sky. As the door opened, noiseless as it was, he turned quickly, advanced a step, and then, after a moment's evident doubt, he held out his hand, and wrung hers almost vehemently, not saying a word. She began to speak ; but her hesitating syllables were lost and overpowered by his rapid and vehe ment utterance. \" You know, you guess what brings me here at this unseasonable hour? I come from your father. There was no one else to come ! \" The last words were said in a tone of apology. \" I fear something is wrong. Who is ill ? \" \" Your father himself. He wishes to see you. He could not write, but he begged me to say7 that he wished you to \u2014 to trust yourself to my escort.\" \" Then he is verv ill. Where is he? \""], [303, "295 THE SUMMONS. \" At Brighton now. He was ill when they landed at Dover. The medical man advised his going to Brighton. He has, however, derived no benefit; on the contrary, he is far worse.\" \" Do you mean ? Please tell me the truth ! \" she said, looking up at him, and forgetting aU her previous embarrassment. He took her hand, but immediately let it drop again. \" Yes ; I will tell y7ou the truth,\" he answered, gravely but kindly7. \" He is in great danger, I fear. I think it will be advisable to lose no time \u2014 to set off directly. He was so very anxious to see you ! I have brought a comfortable carriage with me. Can you be ready to start to-morrow?\" \" I could start at once : this very hour,\" she said, eagerly, but checked herself. \" But you \u2014 where are you from now? \u2014 and now let me go and tell Mrs. Wentworth. You will want some dinner.\" And before he could say a word, or detain her, she was gone \" Do please to come in, Worthy, do ! \" Ellen said, sitting beside her friend and putting her arm round her. \" Papa is dangerously ill : very bad, indeed. It is he who sent Mr. Mortimer ; and he wishes to see me. There must be no delay. Perhaps we must start directly. You will \u2014 just speak to him, won't you?\" \" Lena, Lena ! You forget how these sudden"], [304, "296 UPS AND DOWNS. shocks hurt me. Your father dying ? sent for you ? sent this man ? Well ! to say the very least, it is a tolerably selfish feeling, to hurry you off without notice on such a journey \u2014 just too as you are wanted so much.\" \" But, consider, Worthy, it is death ! My poor, dear father ! oh, I must go to him ! \" and she gave way to her tears. Mrs. Wentworth was uncomfortable and annoyed; but the sight of Ellen's distress, and the idea of Colonel Raymond's danger, did something towards breaking through the crust of cold selfishness, and the temper which at first predominated. \" Well, child, don't cry : dont fret ! Heaven knows, I can ill stand such dreadful flurries ! I who, of all things, crave a quiet life. Of course, you must go ! but it shall be in a proper style. You are my child \u2014 my heiress now ! I will have no coach journeys. I must see the coachman about the carriage.\" \" If you would but see him \u2014 see Mr. Mortimer, just for a minute ! and then yrou and he can arrange it. Do, dear, dear, Worthy* ! \" And she kissed and caressed her till Mrs. Wentworth yielded, and witli her arm in Ellen's proceeded to the study*. The butler had placed lights there. Granville bowed low. \"A very miserable errand: you are hardly a welcome visitor, Mr. Mortimer,\" she said, playfully,"], [305, "THE SUMMONS. 297 yet in a manner which distinctly showed annoyance, and her intention to keep him at a distance. \" Pray, take a seat.

Are you a lover of delicious, refreshing coffee, Mr. Mortimer ? \" \" Thank you \u2014 nothing for me ; I ordered both refreshment and a bed at the inn.\" \" What ! at the Angler, or the Raymond's Arms ? For our village boasts of two, I believe.\" \" It is, I believe, the Abbey7 Arms. I am a traveller, and can make shift with a sanded floor, if needs be. I have brought a carriage for Miss Raymond. Do you think you can be ready to morrow morning ? \" he said, turning to Ellen. \"It must, I fear, be early, if we are to reach Brighton the day after to-morrow.\" \"And must this really be, Mr. Mortimer? Is it indispensable? Remember, my darling Lena is not one of those tough mortals who are hurt by nothing ; nor is she a philosopher who prefers sanded floors. Such scenes are harrowing to mind and body.\" \" Perhaps the injury of after-remorse for not being there might be still worse. It is her father's express and most earnest wish,\" he answered, coldly. \" Well, so it must be, I suppose. But it is rather inconsiderate and imprudent. Is she to travel with-"], [306, "298 UPS AND DOWNS. out any female companion ? \u2014 I have no one to send.\" \"Her father was good enough to suppose that an old friend like myself might be trusted : under certain circumstances, a departure from common rules of etiquette is allowable.\" \" At all events, Ellen, my love, I shaU insist on your favourite Anne's going. She is faithful and respectable, at all events.\" \" But such a girl ! she -will only be in my way \u2014 a source of anxiety.

He turned away quickly, moved towards the window, and looked out \u2014 for the blinds were still up. It was raining. Then he came back again, and in a still forced voice, said he had better now leave them, and not further intrude. He would bring the carriage at any hour they would fix on. Ellen now looked at Mrs. Wentworth with earnest entreaty which she could not misunderstand. \" Pray, assure Mr. Mortimer, Ellen, that a bed is"], [307, "THE SUMMONS. 299 quite at his service here. A more comfortable one, I flatter myself, than even the Abbey Arms can afford.\" \" Thank you ; but I must dechne your offer,\" he said, with the old chilly stiffness. \" At what hour, then ? \" he said, as Ellen offered her hand to him. \" As soon as it is light. The earlier the better,\" she answered. He pressed her hand kindly, bowed again to Mrs. Wentworth, and went away, protesting that he did not mind the rain, and knew the road quite well ; when that lady7 roused herself, with somewhat tardy and over-strained offers of umbrella and guide: in fact, \" speeding the parting guest,\" and so on. She even followed bim into the hall, as the sound of the hard rain clattered on the skylight, and the wind swept wildly- round the house. The drawing-room door stood open, all alight with lamps, and a small bright fire, which Mrs. Wentworth loved for even the look's sake. It was inviting \u2014 the soft, rich curtains hanging heavily, and shutting out the sound of wind and rain \u2014 the brilliant flowers, the comfortable couches, and the harp and pianoforte apparently ready for use. As she repeated her offer laughingly, and pointed to the room, he could not avoid a glance that way ; perhaps, a longing one. \"Isn't that better than the sanded floor and tobacco fumes at the inn, Mr. Mortimer ?"], [308, "300 UPS AND DOWNS.

For my part, I am infirm and weak, and I shudder at a dark, dismal walk in the rain, and such rest as aw-aits you with ' mine host.' A very respectable old creature, by the way : he is a pet of mine.

Don't take the wrong turn and be falling over the cliff ! \" All this time Ellen had said nothing; but her colour came and went, and her speaking face told her distress. Once \u2014 once only, she glanced up at him, as if bespeaking his charity- \u2014 or it might be construed into a \"won't you stay?\" Pie shook hands again as she silently gave him her own umbrella, and there was a smothered \" God bless you,\" which she heard, through all the noise of storm without ; even while she also heard Mrs. Wentworth's words : \" Ellen what will Mr. Vaughan say to this ? He was to be here to see you to-morrow.\" When the front door had closed noisily, and they were both in the drawing-room. Ellen spoke of going early to her room, as she must pack a few things. \" Well ! \" sighed Mrs. Wentworth, sinking into her"], [309, "THE SUMMONS. 301 couch with a weary and exhausted air. \" I did tliink \u2014 I did hope, that this was really your home now, Lena !

She slowly- and reluctantly withdrew the arm which encircled her, and wished her good-night.

The storm raged during the night, but although the wind was still high and it rained fast, it had lulled a little when, shortly after dawn, the travellers left.

Mr. Vaughan found her here. He came up quickly, his whole face and gesture betraying enquiry ; although his inherent politeness forbade its expression in words till he had duly greeted the lady. \" I see you know !

I thought her a sweet, and somewhat original girl, with a high temper, which I liked ; and coquetry enough to make it a matter of interest to win her, while it made one anxious about her for her own sake. In my selfish indolence, I thought if I could get her without ' too ' much trouble, I should prefer her to all others for my wife ; and I believed that it might possibly be my duty to marry somehow. But now \u2014 now, it is her alone \u2014 only her ! Unconsciously I have been led on, it is true, to \u2014 to new feelings. Her manner has at times piqued me.

Can you understand ? \" \" Well, it is difficult to do so.\" \" It is so, however, I assure y-ou !

All was gray, dim, and fading, save in the West, where the red glow of an autumn sunset gave a passing light to the distant cliff and the sea ; bringing out in peculiar beauty a few poor fishing-boats which, ragged and dirty as they might be in reality, became objects of pictur esque interest in the distance. Perhaps the spirit of the hour was contrary7 to the usual brilliant and gay conversation which these two friends delighted in. They were silent now ; he whisking his riding whip with a pre-occupied, half-sad, half-thoughtfnl air, while she looked paler than common, and stopped many a rising sigh, shivered a little \u2014 and then tried"], [319, "THE MYSTERY AND THE SOLEMN OATH. 311 to laugh and rally her companion on his unusual silence. \" I beg your pardon.

There was a sale, and now every acre is gone from the family-.\" Then after a pause, she went on, in a low, musing tone, as if carried back involuntarily7 to old memories. \" He was so very extravagant \u2014 reared in luxurious and magnificent notions, with miserable habits. He played a very reckless game, I believe, in Jamaica, and his old father sent him here a-courting the heiress cousin. They were two lovely- girls then, those Raymonds of the Abbey, Bertha and Ellen ; and your humble servant (you know that I was an orphan and ward of Sir Oliver's) was as a third sister. Some flattering things were both spoken and written of ' the trio.' In those days our lovers were minstrels. Colonel Raymond himself was no mean performer on the lute. Many a serenade we had from the rose garden, on which our own rooms opened. There was no lack of admiring swains, and no end to sonnets, &c. We were like butterflies fluttering in the sunshine, thinking it was to last for ever. So ! the wealthy- Mr. Gerald Raymond, too wedded to tropical life to come him self, sent his son, scapegrace as he was, to his own first cousin, the Baronet ; thereby, as he hoped, cutting short a very undesirable marriage, which the handsome young man was very nearly led into at home.

Well, it was sagely settled between these two cousins, men of the world as they were, that their children and their estates should be united. Bertha was the heiress; sweet, good Bertha! But, oh! the pity of it! \u2014 Perhaps, however, I am boring you? Say so if I am. No ; \u2014 then let us turn in here ? it will not be cold.\" And she led the way to a seat, which, though thickly surrounded by trees, was high and dry, and commanded a pleasant view. She motioned to him to sit beside her. \" So, you really care to hear of these antecedents of y-our fair inamorata ? It won't bore you ? \" \" No ; it interests me.\" \" WeU, I believe the spirit moves me to prose, for my thoughts are strangely7 impelled backwards to day. Where w7as I? \u2014 Oh! Gerald arrived at the Abbey. He is Ellen's father, ' the Colonel,' you understand ? How well I remember that day ! How vividly I can recall the smallest circumstance ! He was supremely handsome, with that polish of manner, that politeness, which we now call of the old school. Poor Bertha, so the fates ordered it, was unfit even to be told of her lover's arrival ; she was seriously ill with the measles at the time. EUen and I were left to entertain him. You know, Lady Raymond was dead years before. She had been a Spanish nobleman's niece. I can only just remember her and her sleepy eyes.

A correct and rigid matron ruled in her stead at the \u00a9 Abbey, ordered dinners, and carved, and acted pro priety7 for us y7oung ones. Bertha was her favourite, for she was docile and kind, and did not play such wild pranks as we two did. So, \u2014 by Bertha's sick bed, she (the matron) watched day and night. And Sir Oliver always went his own way ; whicli way need not be described. But what I want you to understand is how much, how very much, we two girls were thrown with this cousin suitor ! AU day we were together ; riding, drawing, singing, walk ing. No one to whisper a caution, or mar our enjoy ment by a frown. '\u2022EUen was beautiful as a dream. No ! \u2014 y7our EUen, my Ellen, is not to be compared to her in physical beauty; though in mind she is far superior.

Vaughan ! do you believe that only once to any one comes this love \u2014 separate, apart, distinct from all others? Whether first or last\u2014 in youth or age, it can never be mistaken ! The copies \u2014 the counterfeits are deceiving ; but this stands alone : is felt but once. Do you believe this ? \""], [323, "THE MYSTERY AND THE SOLEMN OATH. 315 \"At least, I am beginning to believe it,\" he replied gravely. \" Well, I believe it ! And Gerald Raymond's hour was come ! Whatever had gone before or has followed since, that was his hour: that moment when tlie match was applied. Good Heavens ! it was a furnace of deadly, white heat. Strong \u2014 devour ing \u2014 terrible as a volcano. And she \u2014 poor victim ! impressible young thing ! she was as a straw in it. I tell you, Edward Vaughan, \u2014 I have lived and learnt \u2014 I have seen so-called love and passion over and over again ; but never, never have I seen, heard, or imagined, what that was ! It was not tender, pure love \u2014 such as yours is, I verily believe. It was. \u2014 WeU ! \u2014 it was that of a fallen spirit \u2014 it was of hell-fire !

And old Sir Oliver was wilfully blind and obstinate, and \u2014 Bertha was to be the bride. \" Ellen was sent away; an old worn-out spinster"], [324, "316 UPS AND DOWNS. cousin in a remote village was pressed into service, and invited for a visit. I had to act go-between with the legitimate lovers. Poor, frail, gentle Bertha rose from her sick-bed, ready to be dutiful, and love her handsome cousin ; and he \u2014 walking in the fiery furnace which was devouring him, stretched forth his hand and clutched at the gold, and swore false oaths, and smiled like a fiend ! And I \u2014 I was bound over to keep the secret, and she did not know that he sought her for her money ; that he spoke soft words, and smiled on her, while his thoughts were away. She never guessed! \u2014 how should she? that he loved her sister passionately \u2014 terribly, and that Ellen was dying for him. Oh, the mortal weight of a secret ! Oh, God ! that I might once \u2014 but once, say all ! I must, I shall, turn Catholic one day, that I may confess. Vaughan, are oaths binding always \u2014 always ? Hush, listen ! What is that ?

He rose, and searched about behind the trees and shrubs, then returned to her side, and said, \" There is no one here. But don't go on. It must be very sad to recall these scenes. Won't y7ou return to the house ? you are chilly.\" \" No ; if you are not tired of it, let me go on and say7 all I dare.

But a dead man is risen \u2014 or the supposed dead man \u2014 and a scowl haunts me day and night. There \u2014 just now, I felt his hot, hissing breath on me, as I did that day ; and I heard the stealthy, snake like tread. You are sure, Vaughan, there is no one hidden near ? \u2014 the foliage is so thick behind ! \" Again he searched, almost believing her to be distraught, and considering as to how he could contrive to get her into the house, and to give her maid a hint of the necessity of quiet and care. But she became calmer, though with a far older look in her face. She touched her forehead, and tried to smile, as she said, \" It always gives me a pain here : but I will hurry over my story. \" Preparations for the wedding went on apace. It was to be solemnised in a manner befitting the Abbey heiress. Gerald left us for a short time, ' on busi ness,' he said. Where the devil led him then, and for what \u2014 I know not. When he returned, I remarked that the glitter hi his eye was increased. There was evident preoccupation in his manner, though he never omitted the customary attentions and courtesy to his bride-elect, or to any one else ; and very choice and rare gifts he had for us all. He brought a friend, a very ' dear and intimate friend,' he called him ; who was to be ' groomsman,' Count Arturo Vilani. This man spoke English with a strong"], [326, "318 UPS AND DOWNS. foreign accent, but sufficiently well to converse with ease and animation ; he was very musical, and I liked him. I was a merry young thing, always ready for frolic and fun ; hut Bertha, took a sort of prejudice against him. I know she doubted his good influence with Gerald ; and she used to sigh and look uneasy7 at their long rambles together, and their secret consulta tions which went on at all hours. One morning, I remember well, she \u2014 Bertha \u2014 had long been waiting to write a note, about some setting of jewels I think it was, and she wanted Gerald's opinion, She was weary \u2014 looking pale and a little vexed. We stood at the window whicli commanded a view of what was then called the green walk, a favourite resort shaded by beautiful sweeping beeches. \" ' Look ! ' said Bertha. ' There they are, together, of course, and consulting. One might take them to be of the Council of Ten, or those secret Inquisitors. That man ! What can Gerald see to like in him ? So dark, so hard, so \" ' Perhaps,' I laughingly said, ' he is really a Jesuit, or an Inquisitor. Who knows Bertha? Depend on it, there is some romance about him. Gerald never will tell us anything of him, but that he is of noble birth and his best friend.' As we chatted so, they- approached the house. Gerald was very pale ; he was evidently impressing something earnestly and passionately- on his friend. Then we saw him open a pocket-book and with hesitation and,"], [327, "THE MYSTERY AND THE SOLEMN OATH. 319 after more than once withdrawing it, he put a folded paper into Count Vilani's hand. It was received with a smile which, even from our post, we could see to be one of triumph. Gerald now looking up caught sight of us and bowed gracefully ; the Count went away. Gerald beckoned to Bertha to join him in the rose garden, and down she went. I watched them afterwards, as they now and then came in sight from behind the trees, pacing softly to and fro ; her sweet face blushing now and cast down, while her hand lay confidingly on his arm, and lie but I need not dwell on his looks : God knows they, and others, haunt me. \" The marriage took place with much pomp and circumstance, and the 'happy pair' set off in a splendid carriage and four for the usual tour. They were joined by Ellen, wdio had been ill and unable to be present at her sister's wedding. It was thought that the change of air and scene would restore her, and they all took a house at Brighton ; Count Vilani being of the party7. I had a long promised visit to pay, so knew but little what went on. Their letters were not much to the purpose, neither of them being good correspondents. When, at length, we all met once more at the Abbey, to my exceeding surprise I was told of Ellen's engagement to the Count ! He appeared to be a very devoted and admiring lover; but the marriage was strangely7 hurried on. As for"], [328, "320 UPS AND DOWNS. Ellen, she was grown odd \u2014 quite wild in spirits at times, and then again, silent and depressed. I thought her grievously altered with respect to beauty7. I must hurry on, however. \" It was not long before storms lowered over us. It was more than suspected that Gerald and the Count gambled, and that Gerald owed great sums to him. There were ugly scenes at times ; and poor Bertha's eyes began to open a little to the frightful reality of her position. It became soon so wretched, that I was the less inclined to resist my guardian's desire of marrying me to an elderly and very wealthy man, Mr. Wentworth. He was my husband for five years. I was hardly a wife, when old Sir Oliver died in a fit, and then young Gerald, Bertha's husband, became master of the Abbey. Timber was cut down in every direction directly, and strange whispers of difficulty7 and debt went about, while each mail brought more and more ominous tidings from the West Indies. My husband and I were away for some time ; when we returned, to live here on my own inherited estate, which Sir Oliver had carefully cherished and kept, I was met with the terrible tidings that EUen, that bright, beautiful creature, was very ill \u2014 hi fact, under surveillance for insanity! And Bertha! \u2014 Oh, she was a wreck ! a broken-hearted woman ! But she did all she could to keep things straight, and lived a quiet, sad ancl solitary life, whilst a host of reckless"], [329, "THE MYSTERY AND THE SOLEMN OATH. 321 fellows sent their wild orgies echoing round the old Abbey. There was dreadful quarrelling, too, now between Gerald Raymond and his foreign friend ; the Count Vilani resenting any interference about his wife. But I beUeve Gerald was in his power, and in what followed, more weak than wicked. In the very room once devoted to us merry girls, poor Ellen was kept as a prisoner \u2014 now the wretched Countess Vilani. It was given out that she was ' queer,' or in low spirits ; but I believe she was no more mad than I was, though it was enough to turn her brain. I was not allowed to see her. But yet once \u2014 once only \u2014 I did so by chance. I was calling on Bertha, and in passing down the corridor, I heard a strange whisper, and then some one touched me. ' Hush ! for God's sake, Julia ! make no noise ! It is only \"I \u2014 only- Ellen ! I have escaped them this once ! Oh, Julia, save me! Can't you save me? \u2014 They will kill me \u2014 they will kill me ! ' Oh,\" that voice, trembling, quivering, and so sharp with appealing misery ! And that thin, crouching, shadowy figure, as she appeared to me in the dim light. Her eyes \u2014 those beautiful eyes \u2014 fixed on me, so wildly and wistfully, like some hunted animal. She wound her thin arms tightly round me \u2014 her hot tears falling on my neck. That was the last time \u2014 the last. I never saw her again. She said she wished she could die, and she \u2014 yes, certainly, she did hint at a wish VOL. II. Y"], [330, "322 UPS AND DOWNS. to destroy herself \u2014 or what might be so interpreted. But What am I saying ? Some noise alarmed her, and she flew back to her room in evident terror. \" Strange stories were about at this time. At last, one night it was said that screams were heard by the workmen, and the bushes hi the rose garden were found all trampled and broken. (But, hark ! Surely that is something more than wind ! No ! Are you sure, Vaughan?) It was the very day after the reports got about as to the screams, that I was awoke by the church-bell tolling \u2014 in that peculiar fashion sacred to the Raymond family7. They told me that she was dead \u2014 died in a fit, they said ; and the village doctor confirmed it. Poor Nelly, when I remembered her voice and her hot tears, I was glad, yes, glad to think of her as at rest \u2014 and yet it was dteath \u2014 death ! \" Mrs. Wentworth paused a little, and then went on in a quieter tone : \" Rumours grew loud and louder. An inquest was insisted on ; and the verdict was, ' Destroyed herself in a fit of insanity.' They7 buried her at night in the family vault. There was an old servant \u2014 a nurse \u2014 Goody Fleet, she was called. She forced me against my will to pay a visit to the room. It was awful \u2014 awful ! I have naturally7 a great horror of all these things \u2014 I dared not look. But that terrible Presence was enough.

I left that loom, not knowing how or where I went. I found my way mechanically to an alcove, a favourite resort of us as girls. There I sat to recover breath and composure; and there they found me. Oh, it was dreadful, Vaughan ! that, of all the moments of my life, was the worst \u2014 the most frightful and terrible ! They found me, and made me swear a binding, solemn, awful oath. Just imagine, an oath to last all one's life ! Never, never to have the relief and comfort of teUing any one ! I never have even said so much as this to any single soul before. It is always and always on me \u2014 something I can't escape from. And yet, Vaughan, you wouldn't have supposed such dark passages in my life, would you? The gay, the brilliant, the fashionable Mrs. Wentworth, eh ! isn't it strange ? Yes ; strange and hard ! Hard, to be so mixed up with the miseries and sins of a family not related or connected with me. And I am very foolish ; for now that both Bertha and Ellen are dead, why need I have any further trouble? Yet nothing would content me but to bind my life to this other Ellen \u2014 this dear, lovely, perverse girl. I sometimes think \u2014 I have a presentiment \u2014 that more trouble is in store, and that my very love for her will bear bitter fruit.\" \" No, my dear friend, that I can't believe.

You can't enter into the strength of this wish of mine, or conceive how I dread that Granville Mortimer ! I do so intensely dislike him, and his whole set. Ah ! I have reason too. A woman, one accustomed to \u2014 to respect, kindness, and even, I may say, tender ancl partial judgment, or one accustomed easily7 to win admiration at least, can't overlook the kind of rigid, inquisitorial judgment, which some men choose to pronounce. But it is getting chilly7, so I will hurry over, so as to give something like a flourish and a 'finis' to my tale. I must have swooned: when I recovered my senses it was quite late, with a chill breeze, as now, singing through the 3 3 o \u00a9 \u00a9 branches. I just contrived to crawl home, and then a brain fever came, and brought me near to death. When I could be removed, my* husband took me away to France, and then to Italy. We lived abroad for nearly three years. When we returned here, Gerald Raymond was gone to the West Indies, to wind up his father's concerns, who had died insolvent. I saw Bertha and her little twins; but, by mutual consent, we were entirely7 silent as to the past.

I never had a child of my own ; but I scarcely think I could care for one more than I do for her. Yes ; this love for her, and my regard for you, Vaughan, is the one pure, happy love of my life, perhaps.\" She smiled, and held out her hand, as she spoke. He pressed it, and then drawing it almost tenderly on his arm, he urged her to return to the house. As they went, he thanked her for telling him so much ; adding that, \" If anything had been needed to increase my interest, my love for her, it has done so. God grant I may make her happy : and be a shelter to her from all troubles, from all shadows cast from the dark past of her family.\" Mrs. Wentworth said, \"I sometimes think that in a fainter, lesser way, the old story has been acted again. Ellen is sensitive and morbid. The sorrows at least of her parents, only half known as they are, have weighed on her.\""], [334, "326 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XXIII. A JOURNEY. Perhaps Mrs. Wentworth would have despised him still more, had she known how very little use Gran ville made of his \" opportunity.\" They travelled fast, in spite of heavy roads. But though it was so chilly-, and part of the time it rained hard, nothing would induce Granville to accept the seat inside ; which Ellen, it must be owned, somewhat shyly- pressed on him. He lest her and Anne to their own company. Whenever they put up, he managed everything with a quick ready hand for their comfort. Pie joined Ellen at meals, but was formal and cold ; so much so that she felt it a relief when he left her, whicli he always made some excuse for doing immediately. It was necessary to sleep one night on the road. They- went to an hotel in London. The streets were dirty and wet, the passing cabs and omnibusses, looked more wretched and sordid than ever; yet from having nothing better to do, or amused in a dreary fashion by watching the passers-by- in"], [335, "A JOURNEY. 327 the fog and lamplight, Ellen kept her station at the window without stirring. She forgot how late it was, and Granville had not been in for tea yet. She was wholly absorbed in her own thoughts, feeling chilled and lonely, with a dull foreboding of some evil at hand pressing her. She was roused by the door opening, and Gran ville saying, \" I hope \u2014 I hope you have not waited. I have been detained, and I know I am very late.\" She said something about it being of no con sequence, and asked if she should ring. He went to the bell, looked at her, and perhaps perceiving the depression she could not well hide, and which her voice had betrayed, he said, \" It was very negligent : you should have been in bed long ago ; I fear you are very tired.\" \" Only7 a headache,\" she said : \" and as to bed, I am sure not to sleep, so I had rather be here.\" \" Not sleep ! Indeed, I hope y7ou will. There is much to go through, and all your strength will be needed.\" \" I dare say,\" she answered in a tone of indif ference. \" But unfortunately sleep will not alway7s come at our bidding. In my present mood it never does. But, don't fear; I am strong enough for all : yes, all.\" He did not answer this ; but he looked concerned, and seemed about to suggest something, but checked himself, only- pushing a footstool towards her."], [336, "328 UPS AND DOWNS. \" If I had really thought of all this, if I had imagined you not being able to sleep, I would have aUowed Lily Day to come to you.\" \" Lily ! where is she ?

It was as if some mask fell from his countenance, or some magic word released him from constraint \u2014 so different was the whole expression and manner, as he drew his chair to the tea-table and answered her. \" She is a nice little thing ; clever in some ways, and above her station in every way. But that is not for her happiness \u2014 even her good, I think.\" \" Don't you think her singularly pleasing, refined, and with such good tact and taste, too.\" \" As far as I can judge, I should say she was gentle and imitative \u2014 that is, I mean apt to be what those she looks up to are. But there is little real depth of soil. Her mind is like a forced plant. Therefore she deems me very discouraging, because I try to keep her down to useful and solid knowledge, rather than encourage her to read books above her, or to be always living in poetry. Her temper is certainly charming ; so gentle and so docile, even to that very trying personage, her aunt. I can fancy her very loving, even devoted, where her affection is won. But she will depend altogether on those she is thrown with. The heart with her will always guide the mind.\" \" You like that, don't you ? \" Ellen ventured to say, in a low voice, and not looking up.

I fancy I discern a little \u2014 what shall I call it ? a little malice prepense.\" She coloured a little, as she handed his tea. His change of manner cheered her ; but she was still hardly herself, and felt timid and shy. \" No ; I only mean that I fancied that was the kind of character you preferred in women. One to have hardly an opinion of her own \u2014 a clinging plant, in fact.\" \" I might say you are mistaken, but I suppose it would be rude to contradict. However, may7 I ask why y7ou form this opinion of my taste ? \" \" Perhaps,\" she said, colouring painfully7, \" I was thinking of Bessie.\" \" I do indeed like her\" he said, changing his lighter tone for one very earnest. \" I believe that in her position with her husband, nothing could work so well \u2014 in the end \u2014 as her almost angelic temper. Yes : I do admire and Uke Bessie as a sister.\" There was a slight stress on the last word. \" Poor Bessie ! \" he added. \" She was looking sadly haggard and worn when I saw her. She sorely needed help at one time ; and now John is so ill and in such distress ! It is very bad for her : so lately up from her confinement, too. She has to bear her burden, and a heavy burden, alone.\" Ellen's face had sunk down on her hand. She knew he was, in his heart, condemning her for not being at her sister's side. It was very7 painful"], [339, "A JOURNEY. 331 to be so misjudged. She said in half-whispered words \u2014 \" I have often wished to go to her and to be with her. But I can't \u2014 I can't.\" There was no mis taking the real sorrow and distress of these words. \" No : I know you cannot. I know you must not,\" he said, very gravely. Silence followed; very painful, apparently, to both, to judge from their attitudes and looks. At last Granville roused himself to remark that they must start at an early hour the next morning, and he strongly advised her retiring to rest \u2014 even if she could not sleep. AU the play, the tone, as it were, of his voice was gone again. She arose at once, and said \" Good-night. \" He opened the door for her, and quite at the last moment held out his hand. She had only bowed, but she did not refuse hers. She gave it indifferently, and in a spirit of utter weariness. Being really extremely tired, Ellen did not appear in the parlour for their early breakfast. She only came down when the carriage was at the door, glad to escape any further tete-a-tete. He mounted to the box and they drove on. Ellen sat back in the carriage, and shut her eyes. It was not till Anne made repeated remarks expressive of pity7, that the \" poor gentleman should get so very wet in the soaking rain, so bad as he looked, too, th's morning,\" that Ellen observed the shower."], [340, "332 UPS AND DOWNS. \" But, was Mr. Mortimer ill, then ? \" \" Oh, I am sure he was, miss ! When the landlady remarked on his pale looks, and begged him to take something to keep out the cold, he said 'twas all having a disturbed night ; but anybody can see, just to look at him, that it is not fit for him to be sitting out there in the rain.\" \" Stop them, then ; and, Anne, beg him to come inside.\" Anne called and knocked at the glass, so as at last to attract attention. \" No ! he was very well. He would rather remain where he was.\" But EUen herself bent forwards. \" If you knew how it distresses me ! if you would but come in, even if it is only during this shower ; and you can go out again the very moment it is over, you know,\" she said, partly eagerly7, partly with some bitterness, as if anxious to assure him that she did not desire his company more than he did hers. He got down and shook his dripping umbrella. \"But I shall wet you,\" he remarked, doubt fully. \" Please, sir, to take off the cloak, and then there will be no fear,\" suggested Anne, at the same time squeezing herself into the least possible compass. There followed remarks and guesses about the weather ; and then, as they rattled over the rough pavement of a small town, the attempt at conversa-"], [341, "A JOURNEY. 333 tion died away. They only staid to change horses once, and they arrived at their destination early in the afternoon. The rain had disappeared, and the sun shone out brightly, throwing its long lines of light on the calm, glassy sea. The entire contrast of this coast to Ashby Cross was striking ; the long, low shore and wide expanse of bay, the rows of houses and crowd of pedestrians and carriages, instead of the rough peaked and jagged rock-bound shore, the narrow7 bay, and cove, and the rare sight of a human being. They stopped for Granville to give the direction, and then went on again by streets and squares : and Ellen woke up to the sense of what brought her here. She seemed to have been in a dream; but now she knew she was about to meet her father, and her father's wife, Mrs. Hay. Granville looked at her as he handed her out, and then, with a kindness in his voice and manner very welcome at that moment, he drew her hand on to his arm, and led her into the passage, leaving Anne to see to the luggage, &c. \u00a9& D 3"], [342, "334 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XXIV. THE STEPMOTHER'S RECEPTION. \" Will you sit here ? \" Granville said, opening a door wliich led into a dining-room. \" I will go and warn them of your arrival. Your room is ready, I know. If you will rest a moment, I will send the maid to you.\" It was as if it was his house, and his place to make her welcome. Certainly it lessened the feel ing of being a stranger: the shy dread and fear were partly lost in the sense of support and shelter wliich his presence gave. It was some one to stand between her and \" Mrs. Raymond,\" as she tried to remember wras her rightful name ; some one she seemed to reckon as taking her part and smoothing difficulties. Presently, Graavdle returned, followed by a stout woman, easy to recognise as the professional nurse without the introduction which followed. \" As I was saying to this here gentleman, miss, I am right glad to see him back. Indeed, I 've found him wanting ! The poor gentleman has been asleep"], [343, "THE STEPMOTHER'S RECEPTION. 335 better than an hour, thank the Lord ! It has been real awful with him ; and, between ourselves, she lets on nearly as bad, and in my opinion consider ably aggregates the evil. People didn't ought to give way to their feelings, you see, in a sick-room. One of the first physicians in the land told me ; says he, ' Nurse, pack up all feelings and tears, and such like, when you go to do good to a patient ; ' for you see I was young and foolish then, and ready with my tears, being always a woman of tender heart. I assure you, miss, 'tis in my* belief a parson is wanted most by us at this present. It 's astonishing what effect a few prayers has of a time by those whose call it is to attend to the like. You 'd be wishing to see your ma', miss, no doubt ; but you'll see 'tis as I say, she's most as bad as the poor dear Colonel. Awful work, I do assure you! Couldn't go through another such a night not for no account, nor for no consideration earthly!\" She went on in her professional, trained, noiseless but rapid talk, while she showed Ellen up-stairs, moving in) the same heavy, yet quiet manner. On the landing she opened a door, and peeped in, then beckoned EUen on. The room was darkened, and Ellen could discern nothing, tiU suddenly the Nurse drew back the curtains from one window, and then she saw her stepmother, half-sitting, half-lying, on a small, un-"], [344, "336 UPS AND DOWNS. comfortable-looking sofa, her head buried in her hands. But she rose immediately, and looked angrily at Nurse, saying : \" I think my orders were strict for no one to disturb me until I rang my7 bell \u2014 unless Is the Colonel awake?\" she added, abruptly. \" No, ma'am ; he 's sleeping like a new-born infant. Sorry I disturbed you, ma'am, but I looked to see if you was asleep ; and then I thought y7ou 'd like to see ' Miss ' here. Poor, young thing, 'tis a wisht kind of coming home, you see.\" The officious woman brought forward a chair for Ellen, who was looking earnestly at Mrs. Ray mond, noting the change in her face. She was hag- ' D \u00a9 \u00a9 gard, and looked really years older. Her lips w-ere blue and rigid, her eyes bloodshot and inflamed ; her dress was disordered, and she seemed very w7eak, for she caught hold of the frame of the couch. The thought crossed Ellen's mind, \" She really loves him ! This is grief for my father.\" And immediately a kinder feeling sprang up for her. With something like affection, she stepped forward, holding out both hands : even intending to offer \u00a9 \u00a9 a kiss; but Mrs. Raymond stepped back, so that the couch was between them. \" You may- leave us,\" she said, haughtily, to the Nurse ; who watched this reception with curiosity7, and was evidently7 loath to go. But the lady7's eyes were fixed on her, and go she must. Not till"], [345, "THE STEPMOTHER'S RECEPTION. 337 the door had shut, did Mrs. Raymond even glance at Ellen. Then she said : \" Why did you come ? Who gave you leave to come here \u2014 here \u2014 in my house?\" \"I came by my father's express commands and wish,\" EUen answered, in a tone of more surprise than anger ; for she tried to believe that grief and watching had upset her stepmother's mind. \" Your father's wishes and commands were not always so dutifully obeyed. But I know how it is. You come now, like birds of prey : you come to secure what y7ou can get. You mean to rob me of my right \u2014 my right to attend on him. But I won't give it up to any one. No ! not to Granville \u2014 least of all to you \u2014 you ! Isn't it enough that I hear your name \u2014 the name I have alway7s detested \u2014 night and day \u2014 day and night !

But where is she now ? I have got him ! I triumph, while they are rotting in their graves. Mine at last ! mine first ! yes, long before they ever saw him !

'Ellen!' \u2014 the old detested name But go \u2014 go I say \u2014 do you hear me?\" Perhaps the noise had given Granville a hint that Ellen's reception was not very satisfactory ; for he might easily have heard this loud and excited voice, as he passed the door. However it was, he came in at this moment, when Ellen stood trans fixed with blank horror, -feeling herself in the power of a mad woman. Seeing him, she sprang towards him. \"She is mad. Do let me go!\" she whispered. But he passed her, and went up to his aunt ; took both her hands, and spoke in a tone of gentle, but firm authority. \" Aunt, you are over done. Sit down. You don't know what y7ou are saying, and have frightened Ellen. She only came to help you.\" \" No, miss, I am not mad ! \" was her answer ; not noticing Granville, but looking fiercely at Ellen. \" Yes, I know quite well what I am saying. I don't see, Granville\" (turning to him) \" what right you had to bring her here, to force her on me ! You know we hate each other, and have never cared to meet. You forget yourself. Indeed, it is taking too much upon you: though the Colonel, though we both like you much, and have treated you as a son, and I must own you, have been of great comfort and use ; yet there are limits.

Her"], [347, "THE STEPMOTHER'S RECEPTION. 339 father, I believe, made her apologizing to me a con dition, in case she ever wished to return to him : I have never received any apology.\" All this was said in the old suave tone and manner, so completely the \" Mrs. Hay of Poole,\" that Ellen's temper began to rise a little. Granville, however, looked at her in a way she could not mistake, while he placed his poor trembling aunt confortably on the couch, and arranged the cushions for her to rest her head ; saying a few words of kindness, and soothing her as gently as any woman could do. Ellen obeyed his look, after a short struggle. \" But I will apologise now, if you will let me,\" she said ; \" and I don't say so merely- because I am told, or because I am obliged. I really am, and .have long been sorry for everything that was wrong, rude, or disrespectful in my manner. And I won't interfere, of course, with your privilege of nursing papa. Only I come, because I was told he wished to see me \u2014 and, of course, I wished to see him.\" \" Who told you he wished to see y7ou?\" asked Mrs. Raymond. It was on her lips to say \" Granville,\" but Mrs. Wentworth's caution was remembered in time to check it half-way. \" It was your nephew, Mr. Mortimer, who told me, and fetched me here.\" Z 2"], [348, "340 UPS AND DOWNS. She coloured up, for he was looking at her as she spoke. \"Indeed! So, Granville, that was your sudden business ? And why, pray, was I to be kept ignorant of this ? Did you plot with him \u2014 with my husband, to deceive me ? After all, I believe you are wholly mistaken : you obeyed the ravings of delirium. There were two Ellens ; and this was not the one poor Gerald called upon. Thank Pleaven, she at least can't be fetched ! \" \" It was not any raving of delirium, aunt,\" Granville said, quietly. \" The Colonel was entirely himself that night when he bade me, as I cared for him, go and bring his daughter here, myself. He gave me the most minute instructions as to getting a carriage, and so on. If you recoUect, you were gone to try to sleep, and he begged that no one should disturb you. I set off long before you were awake in the morning; and if he has not since told you, it is scarcely my fault, is it ? \" \" He spoke of business. I don't see why he kept it from me; except, perhaps, he knew that she and I didn't love each other. WeU, she is here, and she has made a kind of apology \u2014 better late than never, I suppose. So, Ellen, we will try not to quarrel ; and for that we had best steer pretty clear of each other.\" She held out her thin and trembling hand, and tried to smile. Ellen took it; and said something"], [349, "THE STEPMOTHER'S RECEPTION. 341 about buryiug old animosities at such a solemn time. \" WeU, I must doubt the propriety of bringing a child into such a scene \u2014 exposing a parent at such a time, when fever destroys all reserve and control. You may chance to hear that which will shock y*ou : but it is nothing to me ! Now, I wish to be alone \u2014 if I may be allowed. Granville, y7ou will act host, I am sure,\" she said, in her usual studiously set and polite manner. \" You are quite a son to us, as the poor Colonel himself observed. ' My dear,' he said, ' he is an excellent yroung man : I feel towards him as if he was my son.' \" Granville here stooped down and kissed her fore head. Then turning to Ellen, he said : \" Well, as I am to be ' mine host,' it is time to show you y-our room, and I will order some tea at once. You will prefer tea, I believe?\" He pointed out the room which was to be hers, and left her to her own thoughts. They were some what confused : the late scene with Mrs. Raymond had so completely upset all her previous notions of that lady's character. The wily, cautious, insinuat ing Mrs. Hay, celebrated for her polish of manner, whom in former times Ellen would have found a satisfaction in stinging into a downright exhibition of passion, but whose anger never came out, except in the most guarded and well considered way : could this jealous, fiery, uncontrolled person be indeed"], [350, "342 UPS AND DOWNS. the same ? It was hard to reconcile this reckless betrayal of what had been the successfully hidden and controlled passion of her life, with the utterly unimpressible suavity and softness of manner which, combined with a certain degree of shrewd worldli- ness, had always distinguished Mrs. Hay7. Her words fitted in with certain expressions dropped from time to time by Mrs. Wentworth. Doubtless they alluded to some dark mystery belonging to her father's early Use. Was it this that was now racking his conscience, so that even the hired nurse observed and commented on it ? And what was it ? These speculations detained her unconsciously rather long in her room. Anne at last came to tell her that tea was waiting in the drawing-room. \" AVhat strange turns there are in life ! \" she thought, as once more she found herself destined to a tete-a-tete tea with GranviUe Mortimer. The urn was hissing, and the white and gold D'7 O china looked comfortable and home - like. He wheeled forward an easy chair, and made her occupy it ; then he searched out a footstool. She wished to take her place at the tea tray, but he forbade it, assuring her he particularly excelled in the art of brewing good tea, and, therefore, of course, liked doing it. She did not urge the point, but sat looking on, as he proceeded to make a few alterations in the arrangements of the room. He did it all like one accustomed to study these"], [351, "THE STEPMOTHER'S RECEPTION. 343 things, and all in the freest and most natural way possible \u2014 as if it was their home, and there was nothing at all surprising in their situation. So she watched him in a half-timid, half-amused way, while he placed a fire-screen and drew aside the window blinds, that they might know \" the sea was there to be looked at when agreeable.\" He cut bread and butter, and finally handed her a cup of tea, which she confessed to be delicious and very refresh ing. She couldn't help alluding to Ids aunt's great alterations. \"Yes,\" he said ; \" she is fairly worn out from want of sleep. Certainly she has been unsparing in her devotion ; but lately it has sometimes been too much for her. She could not stand your poor father's ravings at all ; it was as if each word was true. I was forced at last to take her away. It is not wise,\" he went on, \" to overstrain the strength.

All is often so oddly7 mixed together in the sick person's own mind.\" \" It is said that truth often comes out at such times,\" said Ellen. \" Perhaps it may. No doubt old scenes, old acts of our life do return at such moments. Perhaps old sins are permitted to haunt us ; but one should be very careful not to set down any apparent revelations as undoubted facts. Indeed, I think it miserably dishonourable in those who hear such unguarded words to work out any conclusion ; still worse, to repeat them to others. The fewer about a person so afflicted the better. There have been moments, when I was unwilling that even his wife, my aunt, should be there : I thought it unfair to him, and bad for her. Your father, like too many other men, has perhaps led what is commonly called a ' gay ' life ; though of late years he has been so different. Yet, as he evidently wanders in fancy back to old times, it is not always what one would desire a gentle woman to hear. He would be the very last man to wish it, if he was conscious. Nothing but his earnest desire, his solemn command laid upon me, should have induced me to bring you here under these circum stances.\" \" Oh, surely, you are wrong !

Mrs. Raymond had written to Granville, entreating him, if possible, to come to them ; for she was greatly perplexed, not only on account of the Colonel's illness and some derangement of his affairs, but also she needed some clear head to advise her with regard to her son, who seemed to be careless, and entering into expenses which she had no resources to meet or justify. His conduct had given her serious uneasiness for some time in this way. Granville was fortunately"], [356, "348 UPS AND DOWNS. able to leave London, as his pupil did not require his services for a few weeks, being in the country, and he could bring his writing with him. His pre sence had been an inestimable gain ; and, luckily, the Colonel at once took a liking to him, and even confided some of his troubles about his property to him. Indeed, between all, he had more than enough to do, and his own work was considerably in the back ground. His physical strength, and his authority and firmness, were exceedingly useful as the poor Colonel grew worse. He gradually became, hi fact, the master of the house, the referee on all occasions : it was, as his aunt had said, just as if he were \" theh own son.\" This night, however, his mind was Aery much troubled and divided, and he sorely wished it were possible to be in two places at the same time. He found a letter awaiting him from poor Bessie, opening such a sad history of distress and wrong-doing, as to make his presence there most needful : if, indeed, he had any influence over her unfortunate husband, who, she said, alarmed her by his reckless ways. Bessie suspected gambling ; and often he did not come back to her for two days together, and then so ill, so miser ably excited, it was out of her power to help him. Her baby was very ill, she said, and she ended by begging Granville, who had always been so khid a brother, to come and see what he could do to restrain John. The little money they had for the passage to the colonies was nearly gone, and bills were running"], [357, "349 TWO ELLENS. up in a strange place. She wrote without her hus band's knowledge : he would be very angry if he ever knew she had asked Granville to come ; and she ended by giving many cautions for him to be discreet, and to make some excuse for his visit. At one moment he almost decided that he must go, for he believed he had some little influence with John. If his brother could only be induced to look his affairs straight in the face, something might yet be settled so as to enable him to emigrate. The whole family must unite in forwarding it. With such superabmidant physical strength and energy, so much ready quickness, and shrewd powers of observation, John would make a good settler : he w*as still young \u2014 young enough to break off bad habits and begin a new life. There were other reasons, too, which presented themselves strongly to Granville, for making it very desirable for John to leave England. Granville suspected that it was the fear of a prison w-hich had sent him to Boulogne ; and when he thought of poor Bessie and her three little children in a strange land, and with no one friend near, his feelings prompted him to leave the Colonel and Mrs. Raymond and go to her. But there was another motive which drew him back : as he had been the means of bringing EUen into a scene of great and peculiar trial, was he not bound to do all he could to smooth it for her ? Would not Mrs. Went-"], [358, "350 UPS AND DOWNS. worth require this much at his hands, after her stre- nuous objections to the plan ? Not that EUen was anything to him, of course (so were his thoughts), as compared to Bessie \u2014 his sister by marriage \u2014 one, too, so clinging and dependent as she was. No ! EUen Raymond was quite divided from him. An impass- able barrier existed \u2014 impalpable, perhaps \u2014 at the present time, yet thoroughly dividing. Only as her mother's daughter and as Bessie's sister, was she of any interest to him now. No ; not quite that either. He was interested \u2014 and why should he not be ? in herself. For the sake of old days, he was bound to do all he could for her good \u2014 to shield her from harm and pain. She might have fallen from the pedestal she once occupied hi his fancy and heart ; but after all, there was much that was noble and good in her, and much that was but too fascinating and attractive. He had hoped she w7as improved, in spite of Blah influence, and though not for him, (never again for him !) he did earnestly- desire her welfare. In fact, it was almost the most constant and the warmest wish he had to see her, after all, justify his former judgment, and turn out a fine character. All this, and much more, settled the question. He wrote to Bessie, saying why he could not come to her, and enclosed a cheque for her own private use ; at the same time urging her to induce John to make a true statement of his affairs, and he, Gran ville, would lay it before Cecil. It was the only- way-,"], [359, "TWO ELLENS. 351 and the right way. As it was, Cecil only guessed, and even felt hurt at the want of confidence shown towards him. Were they not all one family ? \u2014 the good of one, the object of all \u2014 and all suffering in the distress of one ? Nothing could be kinder than the letter, hi every word ; yet it w7as but poor comfort to the suffering and much tried woman, as a subsequent letter of hers showed. She was looking anxiously for him ; his letter came instead. It was ashes for bread. EUen did not see her father tiU the next morning. She breakfasted alone. Mr. Mortimer, the servant said, had been sitting up the latter half of the night, and was at this time with the Colonel, that the nurse might get some rest. It was hoped that Mrs. Ray mond had passed a tolerably quiet night, for she seemed better this morning ; and a very elaborately polite message came from her to Ellen, begging her to excuse her non-appearance at breakfast \u2014 hoping she would take care of herself, &c. &c. \" Has papa asked for me ? \" Ellen inquired, as Granville told her she might go to the sick room if she liked. \" No ; he has said nothing. He takes no notice of anything or any person. But he has not slept. All the tune I have been there, I found him, each time I looked, with open eyes. There was too little speculation in them to warrant the idea of Ids being"], [360, "352 UPS AND DOWNS. conscious ; but as he is very calm and composed, it strikes me as a good time for you to go to him, before the doctor comes : for sometimes that visit excites him painfully7.\" Granville sat down to his late breakfast, and Ellen went up-stairs to see the father from whom she had parted in almost anger. Now he was struggling with death ! She was very thankstd to find no one in the room but Mrs. Raymond's own maid, whom Granville had set to watch, and ring if her master wanted anything. She asked if she should go, as Ellen came in, and on her saying \" Yes, she would stay in the room till the nurse came,\" the young woman left. It was very7 still. The bright sunlight, shrouded by blinds and curtains, yet streaming in through every crevice. There were all the usual accompani ments of a sick room, in the shape of bottles, cups, glasses and spoons, and mysterious things covered up. The Colonel's cherished gold watch lying on a table, to guide the nurse as to physic hours. His pocket book (how well his child knew its look, and how familiar was the pattern of the large Indian silk handkerchief lying on the pillow !) lay on a small, light table, close to the bed. EUen advanced, unseen and unheard, on tiptoe, and she saw that his ey*es were fixed on this pocket-book, in which she knew of old he was wont to note down many hints for his memory. She observed with a pang the emaciated"], [361, "353 TWO ELLENS. altered hand as it lay feebly on the coverlet: he had been rather particular, devoting considerable care and time to the due polish and pruning of his nails ! And she heard a low, deep sigh. Then his glance fell on the easy chair in which his attendants usually7 sat, and, perhaps fancying himself alone, he began to murmur something. On this, Ellen came forward, so as to be in sight. The rustling of her dress attracted him, and he looked at her ; but instead of the welcome, the pleased surprise, she expected and longed to see, his ey7es seemed suddenly dilated as if he saw something horrible. He clutched at the bedclothes with a fierce grasp, and attempted to raise his head, gazing more and more wildly, till the perspiration broke out in large drops ; he tried to speak, but his lips seemed glued together : His whole countenance was rigid. \"Papa, don't you know me? I am Ellen!\" and she came yet nearer. \" Good Lord ! she has come ! She said she would: she has come ! Now I know I must be dydng ! Ellen, Ellen ! spare me ! Ah, if you know how I have suffered consuming fire ! horror, horror \u2014 always, alway7s horror. Go back ! all will be judged betw*een us soon. You will be avenged \" He began in strongly excited, quivering tones, but they sank lower and lower, till the last syllable was almost lost. Not knowing what she had best do, unwilling to bring in a third person, and hoping VOL. II. A A"], [362, "354 UPS AND DOWNS. this confusion of mind, which very likely arose from sudden waking from feverish sleep, would pass away, she stood quite still ; shocked and alarmed, but stilling herself, even her breathing, with a resolute effort. His eyes never wandered from her, but a softer, less scared expression graduaUy* stole over them. He sank back again on his pillow with a long sigh, and then held up one trembling hand. \" How beautiful you are, even now ! You don't look like an avenging spirit. I didn't do it : I, who would have died to save you ! Oh, no ! Fate divided us \u2014 fate ! You know I loved none but \u2014 but you# I am parched and burning \u2014 can't speak.\" She took up the glass of water and held it to his lips. But he was looking at her so intently, that for some moments he forgot to drink. S Then slowly shaking his head : \" If thy enemy thirst, eh ? you know ! Not enemy ; no, Ellen, not enemy.\" \" Do take some,\" she whispered ; \" do, papa.\" He just wetted his lips, but stopped as she said \" papa.\" \" Why do you call me so ? More ! it is cool \u2014 good : \" and again he drank. She put down the glass, and wiped away- a tear which was trickling over her face. \" Crying ! \" he sighed out. \" Don't fret \u2014 stoop down close \u2014 closer ; whisper : only for your ear, mind. It is not dead. That was all a Ue ; I say so ! Don't fret : money will do all.\""], [363, "TWO ELLENS. 355 \" Don't talk, papa ; try to sleep, will you ? \" she urged: more and more frightened at his husky whispering and the glitter in his eyes. \" I will sit here and hold your hand \u2014 so : I am so glad to be here and nurse you.\" Apparently he obeyed, for he closed his eyes, reopening them once or twice, as if to see if she was still there. She smiled at him through her tears ; for this helpless dependance \u2014 this utter prostration of the reserved, cold, proud Colonel Raymond, touched her extremely. Very soon, he seemed to be in a deep sleep ; but it appeared that even this did not stop the workings of his brain. He tossed a little, jerking his hand from hers, and then again he spoke. Most of what he said was indistinct, but some of the words were uttered clearly and with strong emphasis. \" Villain ! you are a deep scoundrel : your promise \u2014 your oath ! I '11 give you no more money ; no, not a sou. I '11 have you hanged \u2014 hanged by the neck ! Murders are punished by hanging in this country.\" Then again he said sooth ing words, as if comforting some one in distress ; and her own name was uttered fondly \u2014 in a tone she had never heard it before. Could it be herself \u2014 his child, or, or ? but again he raised his voice. \" Oh, those screams ! those screams I I hear them from him now ; I shall hear them through eternity ! Mad ! It's a lie \u2014 a wicked lie ! \" Then he was quiet for a time, and although the AA 2"], [364, "356 UPS AND DOWNS. damp stood on his forehead, she dared not wipe it off, lest it should disturb the precious interval of quiet. But an ominous sound of creaking boots was heard, coming nearer and nearer \u2014 even to the very door. Ellen rose up to enforce silence by gesture ; but it was too late : the doctor's boots broke the charm. The poor Colonel opened his eyes, and fixed them again on Ellen. A very frightful scene followed ; he was apparently- first horrified, and transfixed with some awful fear and dread. When she spoke, he burst out into the fiercest and wildest adjurations, that she would only forgive him and leave him. Then the next moment, opening his arms, he called on her with streaming eyes to come to him, \"his ow-n \u2014 his own and only love.\" At this moment Mrs. Ray-mond came in. She was followed by Granville, whom the nurse had called, seeing the excitement in which her patient awoke. With a stern determined air, and with flashing eyes, Mrs. Raymond put Ellen aside, and herself drew close to the wretched man. \" Go,\" she said to Ellen. \" You see y-ou are killing him. Leave him to me ! I insist ! he is all my own now-, and neither dead nor living shall come between us.\" Then turning to him, she spoke in the gentlest, most soothing, most loving tones, assuring him that no one could hurt him : all was forgotten and forgiven. He must rest \u2014 and rest in his wife's arms : his own Maria \u2014 his own Maria Duval. After"], [365, "357 TWO ELLENS. a little while, she succeeded in calming him, with the help of a cordial the doctor administered. Ellen left the room, overcome with distress and horror. Granville followed her into the passage, apparently wishful to comfort her ; but she did not even see him. She went straight to her room and did not leave it till late in the evening. Then she looked so pale and was so subdued, that he laid aside some of his reserve and spoke to her in the manner of old times. It brought tears, but it was only too sweet balm. As the medical man insisted on no excitement, it was decreed that she should go near her father no more till some change took place, unless he sent for her. She accepted the decision, believing it was God's will she should not see him again alive. And bitterly did all her sins of commission and omission arise now and pass before her mind in awful procession. Too late now : too lute ! That awful cry which is ever ascending from this sinning world. She could never be any comfort to him! She had not known or guessed at all the remorse which must have weighed on him all these years, beneath that cold, studied exterior. She only knew that he had not been a kind husband or a loving father : but how she could have loved him, and how she would have studied to soothe him, had she guessed the truth ! But w-e none of us do know each other. We know not what festering wounds give a tone [of irritation"], [366, "358 UPS AND DOWNS. and impatience to the voice, or what inward struggles at last bind the spirit in the armour of hardness and coldness. We see but little, and often see that little wrongly ! Only when it is \" too late,\" do we know what a kind and loving word might have done in .those moments of anguish ! But that word was withheld; perhaps, because we were hurt or offended ! Ellen thought if she could but once see her father, and hear him speak kindly to her as his child, she should never dare be miserable or utterly hopeless again. Her prayer was granted before she looked for it. That very night, after a refreshing sleep, the Colonel awoke, quite in his right mind. Pie asked his wife if Granville was returned. \" Yes.\" \" And is Ellen \u2014 is my daughter here ?\" \" Yes ; but surely you won't \u2014 Oh, do keep quiet \u2014 so very ill as you have been ! At least wait ! \" she pleaded. \" No ; no more waiting. Bring her here directly*. But, Maria, I don't mean to grieve you. I hope she has conducted herself well to you?\" \" Oh, yes; I have no complaint to make.\" \" Then bring her, my dear.\" He did not speak when EUen went in, but he grasped her hand tightly, after looking at her once \u2014 when again a startled look crossed his eyes, and he murmured, \"You are so like \" he did"], [367, "TWO ELLENS. 359 not even glance at her again : and she humoured this wish by withdrawing a little behind the curtains. He did not seem aware of her former visit. \" Poor Bessie ! I should like to see her, too,\" he said, presently ; \" and I know* they are hi great dis tress. John has been very* unpardonably careless. I hope you will be kind to Bessie. You two were very fond of each other once.\" \" And we are now ; but \u2014 -but \" \"Ah, yes, I know ! Singular!\" he added, as ifto himself. \" The same story, nearly^ acted out again in the next generation. Then the little ones : my wife promises to care for them.\" Ellen could not answer. It was so new to hear him thinking in this way of his children ; and a pang crossed her, that she was excepted. He did not consider her : perhaps he thought her already provided for. After some silence, he said, \" I think you were fond of a girl called Lily, were'nt you? You used to teach her. She is in London now, I believe ? \" \" Yes, papa,\" Ellen said, in great surprise ; and but for the calmness of his tone, she would almost believe him again delirious, so strange was it for him even to remember Lily*. \" Lily Day was a pet and pupil of mine ; and now she is a governess, and living with her aunt who keeps lodgings : Mr. Mor timer lodges with her.\" \" Ah, and you are still interested for her, then ?\""], [368, "360 UPS AND DOWNS, \" Yes ; always.\" \"That's right. Remember I said so \u2014 that I wished you always to be kind to her : never let her come to want or to harm. Do you hear ? \" \" Yes, papa. I didn't know you cared for her.\" \" She is a nice girl, isn't she ? Pretty, too, I know. You are sure you will be kind to her ? You will be rich, and y7ou won't ever let her want ? Bessie, too \u2014 poor Bessie ! so like her mother as she is ! I hope Bessie will not have a broken heart.\" \" Oh, no, papa ! \" She tried to speak cheerfully, for he was much affected, and the quiver of his lips nearly upset her. \" She and John and the children are in France, and they are going to the colonies : John is sure to get on there.\" \" It is well he is to leave, I suppose. Your aunt \u2014 I mean Mrs. Hay \u2014 my wife \u2014 says so, and his brother Granville say7s so. But as to being in France, it was either that or a debtor's prison. My child \u2014 a Raymond, reduced to that ! \" \" Surely, surely, this is very wrong \u2014 very im prudent,\" said Mrs. Raymond, coming in with strong displeasure and anxiety marked in every7 feature. \" I am going. Good-night, papa ! May I come again ? \" \" Kiss me, my dear ! Yes ; come again.\" And Ellen gave and received the kiss her heart so"], [369, "361 TWO ELLENS. longed for. She dared not venture to utter another word, but with a bow \u2014 for Mrs. Raymond evaded shaking hands \u2014 she left the room. It was with deep thankfulness she sought her bed. But this was her onlv interview. Once again it was tried, but the result was too terrible to repeat the experiment."], [370, "362 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XXVI. RESISTING TEMPTATION. It became at last so evident to every one, even to his wife, that the Colonel had some great weight on his mind, that she urged him to see a clergyman. She was all the more eager, as the doctor seemed to fear the disease might turn to helpless imbecility. That evening Ellen and Granville naturally spoke of this. \" A clergyman must have such wonderful means of giving comfort \u2014 of doing good ! \" she remarked. \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 \" Others often hold back, fearing and doubting if it is their place ; or for some such reason ; but with a clergyman there can be no doubt. I wonder how a man can deliberately7 choose any other calling : it is so incomparably the highest.\" \" Did y-ou ahvays think so ? At one time I thought \" \" I know what y-ou mean,\" she interrupted, quickly7. \" But because I defended a person who chose to deliberate and doubt, rather than rush into it with blind indifference, it surely does not follow"], [371, "RESISTING TEMPTATION. 363 that I preferred, or rather, thought I should prefer, any other calling.\" \" It is a high, and yet a self-abasing position,\" he said, thoughtfully. \" I fancy that where there has been doubt and unfitness, trials, the sacrifice of one's dearest hope, may be no undue preparation, and might perhaps be accepted.\" \" You mean that trial and sorrow are in them selves, if well received, a preparation ? One can fancy almost the very best.\" \" Almost ; next to the preparation from youth npwards.\" Aster a short sUence, Granville asked \u2014 \" You met the Darners, did'nt you ? \" \" How did you know of it ? \" \" I heard. He is my friend. I have but two real intimates : he is one.\" \" He availed himself of the usual friend's privilege of criticising your London life,'' she said, dryly. \" Oh, then, I presume I was discussed for the benefit of the party ! The peculiar temptations and dangers of a London life set forth, I suppose ; and Mrs. Damer would be great on such a subject.\" \"You are mistaken, however; for that was not the ground of anxiety \u2014 I mean \u2014 it was \" she hesitated. \" Oh, I can imagine what it was, then : I can, at least, give a shrewd guess,\" he interrupted, as if to prevent any explanation. \" It would be curious,\" she said, presently, \" to"], [372, "364 UPS AND DOWNS. see a confidential letter from one dear friend to another. I can't imagine what they are about, at all ! Do you ever have a regular, good pouring out of troubles, and fancies, and feelings \u2014 very particular and confidential ? \" Granville could not but feel a little conscious, as he put his hand on his waistcoat pocket and felt a certain letter destined for India wliich lay there. He smiled. \" Why, positively, you look guilty,\" she exclaimed, merrily7. \" Just as if you were afraid I should spy into your portfolio : which, by the way, I often see lying temptingly- on the table.\" \"But ahvays closed, and with a Bramah lock,\" he observed, amused too. \" You do, then, open in your letters ! For that look is an answer to my question. But you are the very last person I should have supposed guUty of such a weakness \u2014 or virtue, whichever it is. I do know some men, just one or two, who might seek relief in letters, if they had no one to confide iu near them at the moment ; but you ! \" \" I am an exception to humanity- \u2014 needing no sympathy7 ? \" \" Well, very like it, I confess ; for even as a boy how ' shut up' you were.\" \" Yes ; but how it burst out when first the opportunity was offered me !

Some natures will have a vent \u2014 I believe it causes many a sheet to pass to the printing-press; and he who shuns confiding in his neighbour, ends in confiding to the world at large.\" \" I have never read any of your published writings,\" Ellen said, shyly. \" Remember, I own to having two friends,\" he said, with a meaning smile. \" Nevertheless, I should like to read something.\" \" You probably have, very often.\" \" Have I ? Where ? I never recognised it \u2014 never felt the strain of thought or expression to be familiar.\" \" Very likely not. Do you ever see the Review?\" \"Is it in that you write ? Now, then, I shall know ! Yet I have read, or looked through, most of the late numbers; for Mrs. AVentworth takes it in.\" \" And failed to recognise me ? Yet, it is natural: You only knew my boyish attempts ; \" and then, feeling that the conversation was taking too intimate a tone, and the rules he had laid down for his guidance respecting their intercourse infringed, he suddenly gave a turn to the subject, and drew her on to discuss books, periodicals, &c. Nor did she fail afterwards to note this sudden check on his part. She was conscious of it very"], [374, "366 UPS AND DOWNS. often. \" So far and no stirther,\" seemed to be his ruling idea. She was hurt and chafed, sometimes even indignant, and then tried to meet him more coldly. It stung her to think that he should be the one to draw back \u2014 to check her ! Yet was he not acting honourably ? she asked herself. Thrown, as she necessarily was, upon him, was he not right to shield her with this very spirit of reserve that she was inclined to resent ? otherwise, often in the heat and excitement of the moment, how awkward it might be for her ! In the course of a few days Mrs. Wentworth wrote to EUen saying she was \" ordered\" away from her home by the Doctor and Watkins, as the nervous sensation still worried her. She was then preparing to start for Paris, and hoped Ellen would either go with her or join her as soon as possible. The same post brought the account of Ruth being seriouslv out of health and the necessity for rest from all study. \" Where could she go ? \" was the question wliich knitted Ellen's brow in perplexing worry7. When Granville heard the difficulty7 he directly mentioned his own home. \" The Bank House is the very thing ! Of course Ruth might stay there till she could either come here or go elsewhere.\" \" Thank you ! But that would not do at all,\" she answered. \" Ruth is so very shy, and your"], [375, "RESISTING TEMPTATION. 367 sisters hardly hke sickness; certainly understand it very httle!\" \" Oh, I thought every woman knew that in stinctively; yet if they do not know, it will do them good to learn : and there is my mother, an invalid for years ! What do you say to that, in the face of your assertion ? \" \" Yes\u2014 but, then \" \"In short,\" he interrupted, \"you think them a hard set. Eh ? But I think I may answer for Ruth receiving every kindness : they would do it to relieve our aunt, you see. And in my mother's snuggery,\" here his voice insensibly dropped into a softer, gentler tone \u2014 \"she would have even as much petting as y7ou desire.\" \" I am sure of it ! \" Ellen said, warmly. \" It often did me good, when I felt hard and miserable and longed for a little of that same petting, to go to your mother. The very touch of her hand, and her voice, and her eyes ! how very-, very beautiful they are \u2014 luminous is the word, I think ! \" One of his best smiles answered her ! Then he said \" Were you often in need of such comfort, \" petting,\" as you call it ? I never guessed it ; at least of late \u2014 though I do \u25a0 \" \" If you had taken the trouble to \" guess \" at all, most likely it would have been wrong. To you, of course, I am one of those strong-minded persons who stand up against all the world \u2014 sufficient in"], [376, "368 UPS AND DOWNS. myself for myself.\" She spoke in fun ; but a touch of wounded feeling showed that earnest \" was mixed \" up with it. \" I was going on to say, that I remember, in old days, you did now and then like to be made a chdd of. I didn 't so much think y7ou incapable of it afterwards, as I deemed that you cared for no one's ' petting ' in Poole. But I must linger no longer : I promised to take my turn in the sick room at this time.\" \" He dreads the least approach to intimacy, I see,\" she said, going to the window and resting her rather burning cheek against the cool pane. Then she stood watching the incessant rain. It was a dreary looking day overhead ; but the sea was dashing in grandly. Again she carefully- read and weighed Hetty's letter. Ruth was seriously ill and unhappy. \" If I were only thirty instead of twenty-one, I might set off and take a lodging at B and have the poor child ; but I am hampered, and helpless. The Bank House, indeed ! And he believes his sister a good and tender nurse ! Well, there is nothing like brothers and sisters for upholding each other. Yet I think I could not do so \u2014 I should see the faults: I do, indeed, all the plainer. Poor Ruth and Miss Mortimer ! If only I had a home \u2014 a home of my own ! What use is all the fuss and talk of my being a great heiress, when I can't secure a temporary home for my poor httle sister \u2014 poor little forsaken lamb ! \""], [377, "RESISTING TEMPTATION. 369 Then the thought came into her mind, that she might have a home \u2014 yes, and a happy, free home, where her pleasure would be studied, her will para mount \u2014 where she might have both Hetty and Ruth. She read over all Mrs. Wentworth said. It was pleasing to be regretted ; and she could not help drawing a contrast between Mrs. Wentworth's own regret, and that she described Mr. Vaughan to feel. Then' she turned to her late conversation. One smile there had been, certainly : yet it was the mother's name which had called it up \u2014 not herself ! No. She thought of his evident hurry to go, his constraint directly he felt the conversation was becoming personal, till her heart sank very low. All this time he had studiously7 shown her that the past was forgotten \u2014 put away on principle. Kind, he certainly was ; but as ' a connection,' as he was always now calling himself, and out of \" duty ! \" And why should she care to have it otherwise ? It was wrong, unwomanly even ! She would not be so very weak and silly7; she would learn of him to be cold and civil, formal and proper ! There were others, happily, who did not judge her so severely. There were others, whose every look lighted up with joy and tenderness at her slightest word of encouragement. There was one who would always love her, and make life smooth by his happy, joyous temper ! And \u2014 there would be a home then for all \u2014 perhaps even for VOL. II.

His aunt met him on the stahs, and teUing him that her husband slept, and that the nurse was there, she begged him to spare her a few moments. He foUowed her to her own room. She seemed rather ill at ease, and as if she found a difficulty in saying what she wished. \" Granville ! I wanted to ask you \u2014 I wished to consult you \" \" Yes, Aunt ? \" \" Well, is it necessary, is it desirable, for Ellen to remain here? You see she can be of no use to her poor father.

Bessie too knows it, poor soul! Will you believe it? Bessie knowing her husband's want of money7, like a devoted wife as she is, gave him her mother's pearls \u2014 her share of the division \u2014 to sell. They were peculiarly fine ones. Do you happen to remember Bessie's wearing them ? \" \" Yes, yes.

I know how the poor dear valued these pearls, for she showed them to me, in her sweet and confiding way7, one day, calling me \" Aunt,\" as she always did, and laughing at her sporting so handsome a bracelet with such a shabby dress : ' her one remnant,' she said, ' of better days.' Well, one would suppose that after such a sacrifice from a wife, her husband would have turned them into money for their mutual support: what does he do, poor infatuated fellow ! he gives them to Ellen!\" Here she dropped her voice into a low but distinct whisper. \" Yes, they had an interview (more than one, I dare say,) but one, I happen to know, took place \u2014 not"], [381, "373 RESISTING TEMPTATION. at Blair House, no !

He was heard to curse all ' marriage laws,' caUing them 'bonds and fetters,' and saying that Bessie would be soon very happy without him. He was so ill when he left, he could scarcely walk steadily : his ey7es were quite bloodshot, and he was sobbing like a child. Yes ! and \u2014 oh ! I forgot \u2014 she was seen to lay her hand on him, and he held her in his arms like a man distracted : she w-as very strange, and not herself at all, when she returned. He hovered in the neighbourhood for some days ; but, as it happened, she was engaged to pay some visit : and it seems her friend had some inkling of the affair, for she was heard to warn her emphatically against it, and told her she must choose between it and herself: ' Mortimer or Wentworth,' she said.\" All this time, Granville had not stirred or spoken; w-hen she fairly stopped, he asked, in a dry and harsh voice \u2014 \"Is that all?\" \"All; and enough ! Surely \" \"But from whom, Aunt, can yrou possibly hear all this?\" \" From one who knows well, an intimate friend of Mrs. Wentworth.

When he spoke, it was in the stiff monotonous tone which often hides the deepest feeling. \"A letter from Boulogne to-day had already nearly decided me to go at once to them : if you can really spare me, I will go to-morrow.

On bidding her \" good-night,\" and not before, Granville told EUen that he was going to Boulogne the next day. He did not ask if she had any message. He fixed his grave, stern eye on her, in a way which made her colour up ; for the notice was short, the journey sudden, and there was besides the agitation called up by his going away : a feeling of alarm lest worse tidings than he had told her had induced him to take this step. She was going to ask him why it was, and when he thought of returning ; but after a prolonged gaze at her, he said \"good night\" so dryly and formally that the words died"], [384, "376 UPS AND DOWNS. away on her lips. She felt that during that brief moment judgment had been passed on her. It deeply hurt her : wounding her best feelings ; and it also roused the hard and proud spirit, wbicb, while shrinking from the unjust blame, would not stoop to appeal or explain.

It was not long after Granville's departure that Colonel Raymond had a kind of seizure, which left him in a helpless and almost unconscious state. The Doctor said he might probably live on, but that his intellect would be affected. Ellen's presence could be no comfort to him, and she clearly felt it was any thing but pleasant to her stepmother. This made her the more readily enter into Mrs. Cecil Mortimer's plan of going to them, where Ruth already was ; for they had taken the affair into their own hands, and fetched the sick child from school. Mrs. Wentworth having promised to join some former friends of hers in Paris, and consenting pretty readily to Ellen's following her there, instead of accompanying her on the journey- \u2014 EUen determined to propose the plan to Mrs. Raymond. That lady began a long and studied speech about her being wholly at liberty to do as she liked ; but she broke down in the middle while alluding to the poor Colonel's helpless state, and burst into hysterical weeping."], [386, "378 UPS AND DOWNS. There was no doubt of Mrs. Raymond's sincere and passionate love for her husband : it was the one point on wliich EUen felt sympathy. There is something grand and powerful in real love, covering many faults ! So, now she fetched sal volatde, and placed the cushions, with a hearty desire to comfort ; but all her efforts were rejected. Check ing her sobs, Mrs. Raymond pointed to the door: \" My maid ! not you ! Good-bye ! \" And EUen obeyed, feeling it a sad and depressing thing to have her efforts at reconcihation thrust back. Lingering outside her father's door, she felt alone and sorrowftd, and with a heavy and indifferent spirit packed her things and arranged her journey. In this mood her friend Worthy's ready, gay acquiescence in the plan, involving separation for some time, gave sharp pahi to Ellen. Yet she smiled at herself, confessing she would have been pleased by a half angry and reproachful remon strance, claiming Ellen's company-, but w_as too sensible to quarrel long, like a child over its bread and butter; and a long P. S. had the effect of brightening her a little. Mrs. Wentworth spoke of Ellen as her heiress publicly7, and insisted on her making an appearance consistent with the title. For this reason she had lodged a liberal sum in the Poole Bank in Ellen's name, and had given orders for the pony carriage and little ponies to"], [387, "THE PLEASURE OF BEING AN HEIRESS. 379 be sent there for her use. \" You will find, carissima,\" she added, \" that all this will wonderfully smoothe y-our Poole visit.

She could have declared that the very same bales of lilac prints and gay flowered muslins hung in the draper's shop, while many a familiar face and figure appeared at door or window, or passed in the street. There was the substantial Bank House the same as ever, with the old Newfoundland basking in what sun he could find either on the door mat or within the passage, await ing his master's exit from that place of business. The master looked up as the carriage rolled past, and pushing away his ledger, caught up his sleek hat, and with more than usual empressement of manner, sallied out, so as to arrive at his own"], [388, "380 UPS AND DOWNS. house just in time to pay the post-boy, and give due orders about bringing in the luggage. He found Ellen already clasped in the weak but warm embrace of poor little Ruth, whose pale cheeks were quite pink with pleasure. And Mrs. C.

When Cecil came in, she turned to him with yet more pleasure ; and there was an air of quiet but unmistakeable pride in her whole carriage, as she watched him give his staid but benevolent greeting, unable even at that moment to suppress the dry fun, which it pleased him generally7 to throw into all he said or did. \"I am so very glad to see you! \u2014 Yes, indeed! for I have a wager depending on it. My excellent sister offered me a tea-drinking against a supper, that we should never call Miss Raymond our guest ; unless indeed that young lady chose to become quite terribly ill and was to frighten you here.\" \" Indeed ! \" exclaimed Ellen, w-ith somewhat of a flash in her eye. \"Does your sister \u2014 does Miss Mortimer tlunk \" \" Never mind hers, or any one's thoughts, since you are here,\" interrupted Louisa. \" CecU had no right to repeat such an idle joke.

Poor little soul, she has evidently not flourished at school. The ways of the place don't suit her.\" \"How could they? \" said Ellen, indignantly ; but then the remembrance of her poor father's present state, and his words of anxiety respecting his chil dren returned, and she changed her tone into one more sad and gentle. \" Papa never knew \u2014 men don't understand, what that school really was and is. Bad for the strong \u2014 bad for me, and actually crushing to a gentle, good spirit such as Ruth's.

Isn't it strange for school-girls to enter into society in this way? I should suppose it must cause some considerable expense to Mrs Harding.\" \" Yes : no doubt. I don't believe she is avaricious. She only cares for money for what it can do, and is liberal in all her notions. Her ruling passion is to be admired. I am sure it is innate in her to seek gentlemen's society. I don't mean any harm ; yet harm it certainly is, in its effects ; for her example is foUowed: it gives a tone to the school; and she ready seems not to scruple at any means in order to arrive at the end she proposes. To make the girls sing, or play, or dance well, she works on their vanity, or their love of admiration, and adopts other very unjustifiable means. Perhaps she may not foresee the consequences, but she ought in her position to do so. She is a skilful reader of human nature, and finds out one's weak points directly. All the girls either turn out bad\u2014 frivolous and worldly, or theh spirits are broken, as Ruth's. It is so I assure you : and yet such a school continues to be popular and always full ! \" \" Her manners would be, to some persons less downright than myself, attractive,\" said Louisa."], [391, "383 THE PLEASURE OF BEING AN HEIRESS. \" Cecil thought her a fine, elegant woman, and also very kind.\" \" Ah, those tears, so ready !

Cecil is hurt at the reserve shown by him and Bessie about their con cerns. Matters were bad enough here; yet, my husband considers that, as elder brother, he had a right to be aUowed to help.

It was carefully hidden from \" grandmamma,\" you know, that this was a final departure : in fact, we all silently agreed to refrain from parting words or looks. But Cecil and I went there in the morn ing to see her off, and to receive her things in charge ; and I never can forget the look she gave up at the house, her eye wandering to each window, as it seemed, just before they drove off,\" \" Her only married home, hitherto,\" Ellen re marked, in a low voice. \" As my husband said, John hardly appreciates the wife he has. I believe it was the knowledge which reached her at last, after he had left, of his terrible habit of playing cards for money \u2014 in fact, gambling, and other very bad things \u2014 whicli finished it. I observed that after Cecil had been obliged to tell her some of the truth, that restless, troubled, wistful manner changed into one more stern, older, and quieter ; as if she had ceased to doubt.\" \" Or hope.

And EUen tried to rest ; she was tired, and this return to Poole had excited her. In less than half an hour, a gentle tap at the door VOL. II. c c"], [394, "386 UPS AND DOWNS. announced Ruth, and then EUen saw in all its reality the alteration which had taken place. She had not grown much in height, and was woefully thin, and so pale and transparent \u2014 more like Bessie than ever, only not nearly7 so regularly pretty. There was a look of deep melancholy even in her smile, and a slow dejection in every move ment; while Ellen soon found that every thought. was tinged with an unhealthy consciousness of being silly and plain, of never being able to do or say the right thing. She did not like speaking of the school, but once, when cross-examined by EUen, she said, with tears in her eyes \u2014 \" You know if I had been clever, or even pretty, it would have been different. I could not learn ! My head grew so giddy, and I always felt so shy and ashamed with the masters.\" She loved to talk of Hetty, dwelling proudly on her cleverness and beauty : \"Hetty was the favourite of the school, and always went down to the drawing room if Mrs. Harding had company ; and then, Ellen, Cousin Alick used to come very often, and sometimes he took Hetty and me out for a walk \u2014 I liked that ! he wras so kind and so funny7. He is Hetty's greatest friend, she says, and now he has gone away they write to each other.\" \" Indeed ! and pray who is ' Cousin' Alick, Ruth? I never knew we had such a relation.\" \" Oh, it was Mrs. Harding who told us to call"], [395, "THE PLEASURE OF BEING AN HEIRESS. 387 him so ; because he came so often ; and when she heard why we knew him so well, and all about it, she said, of course, it was very natural he should wish to see us \u2014 he was, in fact, a kind of brother, and that it was very good for him to come to her house. It was very kind of her, Hetty said, to give him a general invitation, so that instead of being always sm'oking and idling, he came to Mrs. Harding's ; and now we always call him < Cousin ! ' \" EUen strove hard to repress all the words which rose to her lips, but her looks did not escape Ruth. \" Don't you think it was right, Nellie ? \" \" Not usual, at all events. I think Alick had better have kept to his cigar and his idleness.\" At which Ruth's eyes expressed some surprise, and she dropped the subject. It may seem very unlike a heroine : yet as we are not describing any creation of fancy, but a human being, and therefore full of frailty, it must be con fessed that Ellen did feel obliged to Mrs. Wentworth, and did very much enjoy the carriage and ponies, and also the power of being generous and liberal. It was rather a pleasure to be able thus to return to the place, where she had suffered so much from slight and scandal. Ancl she found, what all the world finds, when opportunity is afforded, that many of those who formerly eyed her askance in virtuous disapproval, were c c 2"], [396, "388 UPS AND DOWTNS. foremost now in welcoming her back and in courting her favour. And she could afford to smile at them ; seeing through it all, and knowing well that Miss O O **** <3 Raymond, adopted child and heiress of a wealthy7 fine lady*, was another being from Ellen Raymond, the beautiful but poor daughter of a broken down, decayed gentleman. So she drove her pretty ponies through the rattling streets, enjoVing the drive, as well as the amusement of detecting faces peeping over window blinds or behind curtains. It was astonishing what a stir it made in the quiet little town. The amount of Mrs. Wentworth's reputed fortune speedily doubled and trebled. Some of Ellen's old partners grew excited, and declared they7 had always admired her, and said she was the finest girl in the county ; while several of the new set of officers, who heard the rumour, contrived to ride over to Poole, and lingered about the inn door, or in the principal street, in order to catch a glimpse of Miss Raymond. They were loud in their regrets that she could not join in any gaiety. As it was, Mrs. Cecil Mortimer's neat little serving maid was sadly hindered by opening the door to \" callers,\" and said \" there had never been so many, not even when Missis was a bride ! \" Of course the Miss Mortimers all called, and according to their peculiar custom, \u2014 a strange one for such a united family \u2014 they each called separ ately. The two elder ones received her just as they-"], [397, "THE PLEASURE OF BEING AN HEIRESS. 389 had done before, with perhaps a slight addition of amused and criticising curiosity on Miss Mortimer's part. Rosamond alone seemed to be aware of the change in Ellen's prospects. They had been some times held up as rival belles, and now that money weighed down the balance so entirely, it made poor Rosamond somewhat tart in her remarks ; and w-hen she took leave, EUen remarked wdth a smile to Louisa \u2014 \" I wonder why- it is that young ladies are always the most formidable and the most unpleasant people one meets ! Alway-s the younger the worse.\" \" Rather sweeping ! But Rosy was not her usual self this morning : she is not a bad little soul, only her brothers spoil her.\" \" Ah, you, all of you \u2014 for y7ou are become one of them \u2014 hold each other up so provokingly ! I know you did not like Rosamond's manner yourself at one time.\" \"I did not; I don't now: but when one learns to know her at home, and the little beauty airs wear off, one finds much lively good humour and much gentle ness of disposition too ; though she does rather try to assume great independence of character. But there's Cecil, and I hope he has a letter. Surely we must hear to-day ! \" They both returned, looking grave and anxious. Cecil put a letter before Ellen, without speaking. It was very hurried, and Granville's usual clear"], [398, "390 UPS AND DOWNS. writing was almost difficult to read. He gave a very bad account of John, saying he was certaiidy extremely ill ; yet if they could only induce him to take the commonest care of himself, there need be no fear. As it was, he had run really frightful risks ; and Bessie was worn out with trouble, and the baby seemingly pining away, though luckily very quiet and sleeping always. Granville said he would write again when he could command more quiet and leisure, and meanwhile advised them not to alarm their mother. He found time to enquire for Ruth. Cecil was sure, from the styde of the letter, that it was worse than Granville liked to say. He felt very uneasy and unsatisfied. From what he heard a Poole tradesman say, who had without John's knowing it, seen him one day in London, he feared that the illness had been long coming on. \u00a9 \u00a9 \" I am sure of that,\" Ellen said : \" I saw he was very ill when he came to \" \"You saw ! When John came to where?\" asked both husband and wife in one breath. She coloured deeply, for it was evident he had never spoken of his visit, and it might have been as well if she had kept it secret. \" Yet, why should I?\" she thought. \"It was not my seeking, or any harm, as far as I am concerned.\" So she spoke out, with some hesitation yet calmly. \" Yes ; he came to see me at Blair. It was about"], [399, "THE PLEASURE OF BEING AN HEIRESS. 391 some business : some pearls of Bessie's which he wished me to take off her hands ! \" Cecil gave a dry \"Umph!\" and looked at his wife; her eyes were on the carpet and neither spoke, till, upon his leaving the room, he turned round: \"We must tell Miss Mortimer : and \u2014 what about the gathering ? \" \" If your mother is to be kept in ignorance \u2014 if that is really judged best, why it must take place, or she wiU suspect ! \" \" True. WeU, Miss Mortimer must decide,\" and with something like a sigh, and a grave expression very unusual to his broad and handsome counte nance, he went out. \" He is very fond of John ! \" his wife remarked ; \" almost as if he were his son : more so than Granville, I think ; though I don't understand it.\" \" Granville was never a great favourite at home,\" Ellen said. \" Yes ; with his mother. He is I think the nearest to her heart of all, though she leans so much on Cecil.\""], [400, "392 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XXVIII. MRS. MORTIMER'S SNUGGERY. \"I don't think you will find my mother much altered,\" Miss Mortimer said, as she ushered Ellen up the stairs on the evening of the tea party. She spoke in that tone which people are apt to assume when there is a little unacknowledged doubt in the mind, which they anxiously wish to have contradicted. In spite of Miss Mortimer's assured and gay carriage, Ellen detected this anxiety, and she caught the enquiring expression of the bright and keen eyes when they entered the room, or the \" Snuggery,'' as it was still called. But Ellen had not known Mrs. Mortimer intimately enough to be a good judge in this case. The alteration, if there were any, in personal appearance, was too slight for her to observe, and she frankly7 expressed her pleasure at finding her looking so well. The truth was, that the family in general were inclined to be sceptical as to the truth of John's startling statement with regard to his mother's state of health. Miss Morti-"], [401, "MRS.

Yet it might have been noted that from that hour, she remarked every flush, every quick breath, and each time her mother's hand was pressed on her side. She rallied her, perhaps more than ever, about fancies and whimsies and playing the invalid ; but she wos more sedulous in her attentions, more con stantly in and out, and determined in her resolution not to be absent from home longer than a few hours, and never for a night. Accustomed to lead and command, the rest of the household fell completely into her expressed notions, and were only too glad to dismiss such a terrible fear ; except Granville, who persevered till he succeeded in obtaining Dr. Moore's opinion : which coincided with John's. He also repeated John's warning, that any shock or worry7 might be fatal ; so it grew into a habit from that time, not, as heretofore, to make her room the \".Cabinet of Council\" on any troublesome sub ject ; but all anxieties were carefully either hidden or broken gently to her. They imagined she did not perceive this care, as she made no remark and accepted the news they brought her in her own gentle way ; though her still beautiful eyes were at such times fixed eagerly and questioningly on the speaker, even after the subject had apparently"], [402, "394 UPS AND DOWNS. been dropped.

But that comes under the head of sentiment, and as such is forbidden here,\" was the gay rejoinder. \" My dear ! \" said Mrs. Mortimer, in a deprecat ing way, \" Miss Raymond will misunderstand you. It isn 't, I am sure, that you don't feel, as we all must, our dear Bessie's and her husband's absence \" \" Miss Raymond, of course, must particularly miss her sister ; but she has another in her place : and for my7 part, I don't see if John is to he moaned after why Granville is not to be missed also ! \" Rose put in, flippantly, as it seemed for the pleasure of saying something. Ellen's cheeks were crimson. \" We seem to have lit on most mal a propos subjects,\" remarked Anne, reprovingly, while Cecil stooped and said something in his wife's ear. Ellen felt the timid, sorrowful, yet keen glance that Mrs. Mortimer gave, and some feeling seemed to have caused embarrassment to everyone, and sealed all theh lips ; even Ruth, who had retired behind her sister for shelter, felt that something was wrong, and nervously grasped Ellen's arm. It was a happy relief when the next moment the door opened and the servant bearing the tea tray appeared. Under"], [404, "396 UPS AND DOWNS. cover of the move and the tattle, Cecil came up to his mother and made some joking remark on the marker being stationary in the book lying on her table. \"Methinks it keeps pretty much in the same position, Mrs. Mortimer. Don't you find the story interesting? I thought your tender spirit would bleed at the miseries of Do-the-boy7s Hall : indeed I doubted my \"wise's judgment being so wisely exercised as usual, when she proposed this book for you.\" \" My dear, it was very kind of her : and I assure y7ou I do like it. I was much interested at first ; but, certainly, I have not been in a reading humour of late. I did not know you had such sharp eyes, Cecil,\" she added, smiling at him. \" Do you know, Cecil, that Mrs. Mortimer has lately taken it into her head actuaUy to look out of window! Miss Raymond, your carriage occupies Mrs. Mortimer, at least, I may say, two hours daily : first, in admiring the turn-out, then wondering if it is prudent for your sister lo be in an open carriage that day, ancl then hoping you will not come to harm ; for my mother does not approve of lady-whips at all, and even, I assure you, grows exceedingly severe on the subject\" \" My dear, don't misrepresent me so to Miss Raymond ! It is quite the prettiest affair, I think, I ever saw \u2014 all so suitable, my dear,\" turning to EUen. \" Certainly I have rather a dread of ladies riding or"], [405, "MRS.

Some gentlemen have a prejudice ; and in those days it was less common to see a lady drive.\" \" Ah ! they7 were content to be driven then. Those were the good old days, mother,\" said Cecil. \" Now you see women are all for the rights of the sex, and most of them manage to get the whip hand \u2014 eh?\" \" I am sure you are the last man to say so,\" Anne sententiously observed. They tried hard to keep up the ball ; but as the meal was finished, there was an evident drag. Every one was more or less under a cloud ; and their countenances constantly fell into an expression of gravity. Even Miss Mortimer's never failing spirit and ready remarks failed a little, and she grew rather tart, as she felt it difficult to do what she expected from the others. Cecil's pleasant genial face was not itself, for all his dry jokes : he even ate his favourite cake without remark, and at last took refuge in a newspaper, from which he read out bits of news. Suddenly he stopped short, feeling a pressure of admonition on his foot, and looking up, met his eldest sister's eyes fixed on him with a warning look. The fact was, that this provincial paper contained a rather broad (though supposed to be hidden) allusion to John's flight from Poole. His expression of blank dismay tickled Rosamond, and she burst into a fit of laughter,"], [406, "398 UPS AND DOWNS. whicli soon threatened to become hysterical. Miss Mortimer caught her by the arm and pulled her out of the room at once ; and Cecil looked enquiringly at his wife, who came to the rescue, and made some remark about the winter quadrille parties. \"Mr. Rich refuses to be manager, and Major Grant is proposed as a good master of the ceremonies.\" \" But very extravagant, and the Poole folks won't like that,\" said Cecil. \" Ah, they will miss poor John here, at least,\" Anne remarked. At this moment Miss Mortimer and Rosamond returned, the latter evidently not quite steady yet, but kept in order by her sister's eye. \" What again ? \" she whispered, annoyed, and louder in consequence than she was quite aware of. \"Are you all foolish?\" she said, severely. A pause of rather uncomfortable silence followed : Miss Mortimer's brow was still ruffled, as she asked EUen if she was as fond of dancing as ever. Ellen did not hear her, so intently w-as she watching the rapid changes in Mrs. Mortimer's expressive counte nance. The colour came, and then died away7, leaving even her lips pale, and she pressed her hand tightly on her side. Once or twice she had seemed about to speak, but after looking eagerly round on the different faces, she only drew quick, gasping sighs. \" I asked you, Miss Raymond \" Miss Mortimer repeated. \" Mother are you ill ? The fact is,\""], [407, "MRS. MORTIMER'S SNUGGERY. 399 she said, rising brusquely, and speaking sharply, \" We are too large a party : I know it ; I said so,\" and she seemed about to dismiss them all, but Mrs. Mortimer held out her trembling hand and looked entreatingly at her, while it was evident her quick breathing prevented her from speaking. Quickly CecU's wife opened one of the windows, and Miss Mortimer poured out some drops of ether, whicli was alwray7s at hand, and gave it to her mother. Almost as soon as she had swaUowed it, she said, pausing between each word, \" Don't distress your self: it is nothing. It is not the party: I only \u2014 only wish it was larger. Yes ;\" she added, in a stronger voice, and with tears in her eyes, \"that is the misery! and oh, if \u2014 I \u2014 if you would but tell me all \u2014 all, my dears, how much better I could bear it !

We have tried to make the best of it to you, hoping that things would soon assume a more cheerful aspect than they seem to promise.\" Then she stopped and looked appealingly to her husband and to Miss Mortimer, feeling it was not her place to say more. \" Thank you, my dear : I know it was aU out of kindness. But you see, I can't help thinking of things ! and John's going away has never seemed to me explained or accounted for : and poor dear Bessie's pale, wasted face made me fearful. I am sure you will see that it it is better for me to know all ? \" she added, looking from her eldest daughter, whose hand she had caught and was pressing to her lips, to Cecil. \"Yes, mother,\" he said, \"you shall know all: I see it was a mistake.\" \" I don't think so,\" said Miss Mortimer, in some thing of her usual tone. \" Invalids are not judges of what is good for them,\" she added. \" My mother has no right to risk her life in indulging a feelin \u00ab\u2022 of distrust or over-anxiety.

I think a little quiet would quite set me to rights : Miss Raymond will like to hear some music, perhaps, down-stairs. \"Never mind that,\" said Miss Mortimer, shortly- ; \" we will take care of Miss Raymond.\" EUen drew near to say \" Good-night,\" and was moved from her heart to stoop and kiss the troubled face. She had scarcely touched her forehead, when Miss Mortimer said \u2014 \" We will dispense with ceremonies, if you please. Now, good people, good-night ! The drawing-room is lighted.\" As they w*ere leaving, Mrs. Mortimer called Cecil, in a trembling voice, and made him promise to come and see her next day and tell her everything. There w-as a faint attempt at promoting conversa tion down-stairs ; but the large room looked dull, the fire was nearly out, and Ruth so very tired, that Ellen was glad of the excuse to propose herself and sister returning home. She thought that the family might wish to talk together privately. Cecil and his wife, however, chose to go with them; though he left them at the door, saying he should take a stroll in the garden, and return to enquire for his mother. DD VOL.

The expected letter from Granville was such as to make even Miss Mortimer thankful that the ice had been broken, and Mrs. Mortimer in a measure prepared for iU tidings, with no worse effect as yet than a more than commonly restless night foUowing the evening of the \" gathering.\" Although Granville bade them not give up hope, they one and all felt that he was trying to persuade both himself and them that things were better than they actuaUy were. He said there w-as no longer a question of John's allowing care ; he was so very- Ul as to be helpless in their hands. He also added that his brother was suffering from great agitation of o o o mind, and insisted on going over all the history of his affairs with Granvdle, even desiring his wife's absence while he did so : but hitherto John had been too ill and' suffering to accomplish this, though it was evident it would be a relief. As for Bessie, she seemed to be supernaturally sustained ; and it was no time even to consider the fearful reaction which must take place when the motive for such exertion was gone. She had not undressed for many nights, and scarcely ever left her husband."], [411, "403 DEATH-BED WORDS. Luckily, a kind and good-natured French bonne had contrived to win the children's affections, and they were content to remain with her ; leaving their poor mother free to bestow aU her strength and time on her husband and poor little infant : who was stiU alive, though that was aU. This bad news soon spread about, and the town \u2014 which before had been canvassing the reprehensible conduct of John Mortimer, and busily- searching out all his misdeeds, real and imaginary \u2014 now was ready with curious, but real sympathy and sorrow7 ; bewail ing the fate of one who had been born and bred among them : one of an old established and highly respected family ; one, indeed, who, in spite of many faults, had made himself popular. And now, nothing was remembered but his good looks, and his pleasant, jovial manner, and all the promise of cleverness and success whicli he had once given. From him they turned to his wife ; and, since some one must hear the blame where wrong clearly exists, it became the fashion of the hour to hint hard things of her domestic management, and to insinuate that if he had been wild and \" a thought \" too gay for a married man, perhaps, he had not found all at home so cheerful as he. liked. Some few, however, mourned heartily for the severe trial hanging over this \" sweet httle woman's head,\" saying that she had never been *\" high, but always so amiable and so gentle, and whatever had happened, it was very wrong to lay DD 2"], [412, "404 UPS AND DOWNS. the blame on her ! \" And then a dark and miserable rumour was whispered about, and again the blame shifted to another ; but she whom it concerned was happdy unconscious of it; though alone in her chamber she did severely- question the past, and with all her heart prayed for one wdio had deeply sinned. \" Yes ! a letter from GranviUe ! \" said Cecil, in answer to his wife's eager enquiries. \" There is also one gone for the Bank House to Mrs. Mortimer herself. And\u2014 here is one, wldch looks something like poor Bessie's own writing, for Ellen.\" Soon after the opening of these letters, the windows of the Bank House as well as Cecil's cottage were darkened, and the towns people knew that one of their own people had been called away, in his prime, in the strength of his intellect and beauty. As it is impossible to describe Ellen's feelings, it will be best to transcribe some extracts from Bessie's letter. \" . . . . Yet I do not write to tell you this. Other pens would tell you that I have lost him \u2014 lost him for ever. No ! not for ever ! I write because he bade me do so.

Only, I am sure had you but seen him \u2014 seen his look, and heard him, even ' you,' must have forgiven him. He did so wish to hear you say so ! But this could not be.

It was supposed to be a case of violent inflammation, neglected at first. He entered into business matters with Cecil, confessing John, as far as he could make out, to be a bankrupt, with many debts. Bessie was entirely ignorant about it. He spoke of her, as keeping up in an unaccountable impassive manner ; shedding no tears, but going through the routine of the day like a machine : never entering on the subject of her loss except in a business tone ; but docile and ready to be advised as ever. He said there was some idea of her joining the Raymonds at Brighton ; Mrs. Raymond having w7ritten most kindly to press it, and saying that \" the Colonel was much better in health, and able to sit up a little every day ; but hardly conscious of anything and having utterly lost his power o recollection.\" Granville said he should remain to bring Bessie to Brighton, if she decided on going there ; and at present she seemed not disinclined to the plan. Then he should try to have a day or so at home on his way to London, where it was very needful he should soon be. He alluded to revelations made by John, which had the effect of removing a mountain from his own heart ; and he spoke vaguely (to Cecil) of justice which must be done to some injured person.

But as he had never been included in the town or even the family gossip, much that he heard now was new and strange to him. Though, as he said, \"it gave hhn the key7 to understand many hitherto dark sayings of Granville's.\" The whole affair, even as related by his wife, appeared to him almost too wild to be com prehensible. And rather, he said, \"belonged to a romance, than to one of his own kith and kin.\" That such a terrible history should have gone on in the little quiet common-place town of Poole, was intensely surprising to him. He turned with almost a sigh of relief to consider troubles much more suited to his understanding. He set himself seriously* to reckon way7s and means, and devise some plan of support for his poor brother's widow and orphan children. He added, while he mended his pen pre paratory7 to drawing up some accounts, \" Granville has turned out a much better man of business than I ever expected. Really7 he has common sense, and good judgment too, when he chooses to exercise it. Strange ! how mistaken one may be.
