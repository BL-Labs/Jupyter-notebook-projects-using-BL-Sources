That both existed in some sense or other is undeniable ; for the most ancient of all his tories mentions commodities which are the native produce of India, and which if they were known, of necessity must have been conveyed. What the course of conveyance was by land, or on the north, is a subject which does not enter into the plan of the following work ; but the transport by sea' is a considera tion of air others the most important; it is dependent on a discovery common to all the nations of the world ; the do minion of the sea may pass from one people to another, but the communication itself is opened once for all ; it can never be shut.

II. The Periplus of the Erythrean Sea is a title prefixed to a work which contains the best, account of the commerce carried on from the Red Sea and the coast of Africa to the East Indies, during the time that Egypt was a province of the Roman empire. This work was first edited from the press of Froben at Basle, in 1533, with a prefatory epistle by Gelenius3; but from what manuscript I have never been able to discover ; neither is it known whether any manuscript of it is now in existence. The edition of Stuckius at Zurich, in 1577, and Hudson in 1698, at Oxford, are both from the printed copy, which is notoriously incorrect, and their emendations remove few of the material difficulties4; besides these, there is a translation in the collec tion of Ramusio, faithful indeed, as all his translations are, but without any attempt to amend the text, or any comment to ex plain it ; he has prefixed a discourse however of considerable merit and much learning, which I have made use of wherever it could be of service, as I have also of the commentaries of 3 Sigismund Gelenius was a man of family, See Jortin's Life of Erasmus, vol. ii. 471 and of great learning ; he was one of the cor- 4S6. and Bayle. rectors of Froben's press at Basle, and much 4 The two inexplicable difficulties are, connected with Erasmus and Luther.

The Erythrean Sea is an appellation given in the age of the author to the whole expanse of ocean reaching from the coast of Africa to the utmost boundary of ancient knowledge on the east; an appellation, in all appearance, deduced from their en trance into it by the straits of the Red Sea, styled Erythra5 by the Greeks, and not excluding the gulph of Persia, to which the fabulous history of a king Erythras is more peculiarly ap propriate. Who the author was, is by no means evident, but certainly not Arrian of Nicomedia, who wrote the history of Alexander, whose writings have been the subject of my meditations for many years, and whose name I should have been happy to prefix to the present work ; he was a man of eminence by birth, rank, talents, and education, while the author before us has none of these qualities to boast; but veracity is a recommendation which will compensate for deficiency in any other respect : this praise is indisputably his due, and to display this in all its 5 We are warned against the connection of Erythra with Erythrean by Agatharchides, p. 4.

Salmasius and Hudson give little credit to Agathaichides for this intel ligence. See note, ibid. : both agree in sup posing Edom, Red, to be the true etymology, the sea of Edom, or Esau, the Idumean Sea.

Arrian of Nicomedia has left us the Paraplus of Nearchus, and the Periplus of the Euxine Sea ; and as the latter was pub lished by Gelenius6, in the same volume with the work which is the immediate object of consideration, it is not impossible, if the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea was found anonymous, that it was attributed to an author whose name on similar subjects was familiar. But if Arrian be the real name of the author now under contemplation, and not fictitious, he appears from in ternal evidence to have been a Greek, a native of Egypt, ora resident in that country, and a merchant of Alexandria : he manifestly sailed on board the fleet from Egypt, as far as the gulph of Cambay, if not farther ; and, from circumstances that will appear hereafter, is prior to Arrian of Nicomedia by little less than a century. His work has long been appreciated by geographers, and is worthy of high estimation as far as the author can be supposed personally to have visited the countries he describes; some scattered lights also occur even in regard to the most distant regions of the east, which are valuable as ex hibiting the first dawn of information upon the subject. Of this work no adequate idea could be formed by a transla tion ; but a comparison of its contents with the knowledge of India, which we have obtained since Gama burst the barrier of discovery, cannot but be acceptable to those who value geo graphy as a science, or delight in it as a picture of the world. 6 See Hudson's preface to the Minor do- not learnt that a prior edition existed.

The Periplus itself is divided into two distinct parts, one com prehending the coast of Africa from Muos Hormus to Rhapta; the other, commencing from the same point, includes the coast of Arabia, both within the Red Sea and on the ocean ; and then passing over to Guzerat runs down the coast of Malabar to Ceylon. It is the first part, containing the account of Africa, which I now present to the public ; a work which, perhaps, I ought never to have undertaken, but which I hope to complete with the addition of the oriental part, (if blessed with a con tinuance of life and health,) by devoting to this purpose the few intervals which can be spared from the more important duties in which I am engaged. The whole will be comprehended in four books ; the first consisting of preliminary matter, and the other three allotted respective^ to Africa, Arabia, and India, the three different countries which form the subject matter of the Periplus itself. In the execution of this design I shall en croach but little on the ground already occupied by Doctor Robertson ; but to Harris, and his learned editor Doctor Campbell, I have many obligations. I follow the same ar rangement in my consideration of the Greek authors, borrowing sometimes from their materials, but never bound by their de cisions : where I am indebted I shall not be sparing of my ac knowledgments ; and where I dissent, sufficient reasons will be assigned. I could have wished for the company of such able guides farther on my journey ; but I soon diverge from their track, and must explore my way like an Arab in the desert, by a few slight marks which have escaped the ravages of time and the desolation of war.

Anquetil du Perron and Bernoulli7, exclaim at the injustice of our conquests ; but who ever asserted that conquest was founded upon justice? The Portuguese, the Hollanders, and the French were all in- truders upon the natives, to the extent of their ability, as well as the British. India in no age since the irruptions of the Tartars and Mahomedans has known any power, but the power of the sword ; and great as the usurpation of the Europeans may have been, it was originally founded in necessity. It is not my wish to justify the excess ; but there are nations, with which there can be no intercourse without a pledge for the se- curity of the merchant. The Portuguese, upon their first ar rival at Calicut, could not trade but by force : it was in conse quence of this necessity, that all the Europeans demanded or extorted the liberty of erecting forts for their factories; and this privilege, once granted, led the way to every encroachment which ensued. I notice this, because the same danger pro- 7 See Description de l'Inde, in three vols. by Bernoulli, Berlin 1787, vol. ii."], [36, "8 PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. duced the same effects from the beginning. It will appear from the Periplus, that the Arabians in that age had fortified their factories on the coast of Africa, and the Portuguese historians mention the same precaution used in the same country by the Arabs in the age of Gama. From this slender origin all the conquests of the Europeans in India have taken their rise, till they have grown into a consequence which it was impossible to foresee, and which it is now impossible to control. No nation can abandon its conquests without ruin ; for it is not only posi tive subtraction from one scale, but preponderancy accumulated in the other. No power can be withdrawn from a single pro vince, but that it would be occupied by a rival upon the in stant. Nothing remains but to moderate an evil which cannot be removed, and to regulate the government by the interests of the governed. This imports the conquerors as much as the conquered ; for it is a maxim never to be forgotten, that the Portuguese lost by their avarice the empire they had acquired by their valour; but of this too much : \u2014 our present business is not with the result of discovery, but its origin. Voyages are now performed to the most distant regions of the world without any intervening difficulties but the ordinary hazard of the sea. In the ancient world the case was very dif ferent : a voyage from Thessaly to the Phasis was an achieve ment which consecrated the fame of the adventurers by a me morial in the Heavens,, and the passage from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic Ocean was to the Phenicians a secret of state. The reality of the Argonautic expedition has been questioned ; but if the primordial history of every nation but one is tinctured with the fabulous, \"and if from among the rest a choice is ne cessary to be made, it must be allowed that the traditions of"], [37, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 9 Greece are less inconsistent than those of the more distant re gions of the earth. Oriental learning is now employed in un ravelling the mythology of India, and recommending it as con taining the seeds of primeval history ; but hitherto we have seen nothing that should induce us to relinquish the authorities we have been used to respect, or to make us prefer the fables of the Hindoos or Guebres to the fables of the Greeks. Whatever difficulties may occur in the return of the Argonauts 8, their passage to Colchis is consistent; it contains more real geo graphy than has yet been discovered in any record of the Bra mins or the Zendavesta, and is truth itself, both geographical and historical, when compared with the portentous expedition of Ram9 to Ceylon ; it is from considerations of this sort that we must still refer our first knowledge of India to Grecian sources, rather than to any other ; for whatever the contents of the In dian records may finally be found to have preserved, the first mention of India that we have, is from Greece, and to the his torians of Greece we must still refer for the commencement of our inquiries; their knowledge of the country was indeed im perfect, even in their latest accounts, but still their very earliest shew that India had been heard of, or some country like India in the east ; a glimmering towards day is discoverable in Homer, Herodotus, and Ctesias ; obscure indeed, as all knowledge of this sort was, previous to Alexander, but yet sufficient to prove that India was always an object of curiosity and inquiry. 8 See Strabo, lib. i. pp. zx. 45. 46. 9 See Maurice's History of Hindostan, vol. ii. p. 243.

In this we may so far agree with Strabo, that Homer did not know India as the country of Hindoos ; \u2014 he did not know it even by name ; but he knew that there were people of a black colour at the two ex tremes from Egypt, east and west ; and conse quently this knowledge extended on the east beyond Arabia, for the Arabs are not black. Od. A. 19. See the note upon this passage in Pope's translation of the Odyssey, where he adduces with great propriety the testimony of Strabo, to prove that all those nations were accounted Ethiopians by the early Greeks, who lived upon the Southern Ocean from east to west ; and the authority of Ptolemy to shew, \" that \" under the zodiack from east to west, inhabit \" the Ethiopians black of colour.\" The 2"], [39, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 11 sent, still it is not too much to say, that the centre he has assumed is the most proper of all others, that the distant Ethiopians\" to the east of it, are Indians, and to the west Negroes. These two species are -perfectly distinguished by their make, by their features, and above all by their hair; whether Homer knew this characteristic difference does not ad mit of proof, but that he knew they were of a separate race is undeniable, and that he placed them east and west at the ex tent of his knowledge, is an approximation to truth, and con sistent with their actual position at the present hour. HERODOTUS. IV. The distinction which Homer has not marked, is the first circumstance that occurred to Herodotus ; he mentions the eastern Ethiopians considered as Indians, and differing from those of Africa expressly by the characteristic I3 of long hair, as opposed to the woolly head of the Cafre. We may collect also, with the assistance of a little imagination, the distinct notice of three sorts of natives, which correspond in some degree with the different species which have inhabited this country in all ages. The Padei on the north '*, who are a savage people how far east beyond this province we are to fix the Padei is indefinite. I cannot suppose that Herodotus had received any report of the nations north of the Himmalu Mountains, or else I should offer a conjecture to the Ori entalists, whether Padei, converted into Pudei, might not allude to Budtan ; for a and u are convertible, as is evident in Multan, which is only another form of reading Mul-tan for Mal-tan or Mallistan, the country of the Malli. Rennell on Herod. 310. says, Padda is the \" ' Ecrj/aTO*. 13 Lib. vii. p. 541. 14 If the situation of the Padei were ascer- tained, we might inquire about the manners attributed to them by the historian ; but he mentions only some tribes that live upon the marshes formed by the river (that is, probably the Indus), and then the Padei to the east of these ; this places them on the north of India : as to all appearance the marshes noticed are those formed by the rains in the Panjeab, but C 2 \u25a0"], [40, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 12 resembling the tribes which are still found in the northern mountains, mixed with Tartars perhaps, and approaching to their manners ; a second race living far to the south, not sub ject to the Persian empire15, and who abstain from all animal food ; under this description we plainly discover the real Hin doos ; and a third inhabiting Paktuia and Caspattirus, who re semble the Bactrians in their manners, dress, and arms, who are subject to Persia, and pay their tribute in gold ; these, whether we can discover Caspaturus or not, are evidently the same as those tribes which inhabit at the sources west of the Ii\\dus ; who never were Hindoos, but possess a wild mountainous country, where their fastnesses qualify them for a predatory16 life, and where they were equally formidable to Alexander, to Timour, and Nadir Shah17; they resemble to this day the Bactrians, as much as in the time of Herodotus, or rather the Agwhans in their neighbourhood ; and are as brave as the one, and as ferocious as the other. These tribes it is more necessary to mark, because it will prove that the Persians never were masters of India properly ,s so called, but of that country onlv which is at the source of the Indus. Whether they penetrated bej'ond the main stream, that is the Indus or the Attock itself, name of the Ganges ; but are not Padda and Ganga both expressive of a river ? for there is a Padda and a Ganga in the Carnatick, as well as in Bengal. Indica, expressly asserts, that the power of the Assyrians, the Medes, and Persians, did not ex*end beyond the Indus. Between the Cophes and Indus, he says, the tribes are calied Assaceni and Astaceni, and their capital Massaca ; and he notices another large city, Peukcla ; but Pccheli is not west of the Indus. Bazira is supposed to be Peishawer. He does not consider them as Indians, uor any others except those beyond the Indus, i. e. the At tock, the forbidden river. See Schmeider's Arrian, p. S. ,s Lib. iii. p. 248. 16 See Goez's journey from Attock to Ca bul. Purchas, iv. 31 1. from Trigault. Goez himself was plundered in this country. 17 Nadir was glad to compound with these tribes, to let him pass unmolested with the plunder of the unhappy Mahomed Shah. \" Arrian, at the commencement of the"], [41, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 13 must be left in doubt ; but Paktuia, according to Major Ren- nell, is Peukeli; and if Caspaturus be the same as the Caspira of Ptolemy, there is some ground for supposing that city cor- respondent to Multan. Should these conjectures be confirmed by future inquiry, it would prove that the Persians did pass the Attock, and were really masters of the Panjeab and Multan; and the tribute which they received, equal to half the revenues of the empire, affords some reason for supposing this to be the fact. Much depends upon the issue of this inquiry, because the Attock, or forbidden river, has been the western boundary of Hindostan in all ages; if the Persians passed it, India was tributary to them : if they did not, the tribes west of the Attock only were subjected, and these were never Hindoos, however esteemed so by the Persians. Another circumstance dependent on this inquiry, is the voyage of Skulax, said to have com- menced from Pacthia and Caspaturus, and to have terminated in the Gulph of Arabia. There are two inconsistencies in the report of this voyage by Herodotus; the first, that he mentions the course of the Indus to the east I9, which is in reality to the south-west ; the second, that he supposes Darius \"\u00b0 to have made use of the .discoveries of Skulax for the invasion of India. Now if Darius was master of the Attock, Peukeli, and Multan, he wanted no information concerning the entrance into India, for this has 19 See Hyde Rel. Vet.

The Persians were never a maritime people. History no where speaks of a Persian fleet in the Indian ocean, or even in the Gulph\" of Persia ; and in the Mediterranean, their sea forces always consisted of Phenicians, Cyprians, or Egyptians. Far is it from my wish wantonly to discredit any historical fact supported on the testimony of such a writer as Herodotus ; but there are insuperable difficulties in admitting this voyage of Skulax, or that of the Phenicians round the continent of Africa ; the greatest of all is, that no consequences accrued from either. That Her6dotus received the account of both from Persians or Egyptians, is undeniable ; that they were per formed is a very different consideration. I do not dwell upon the fabulous \" part of his account of India ; because even his fables have a foundation in fact\"; but I cannot believe from the state of navigation in that age, that Skulax could perform w I speak of a navy, not ships for trade. <P\u00abH)S f-t, ya-nc-irif tuiv x^oSarm, lib. iii. 24S. quod populo universo nequaquam objiciendum est, sed originem ducit ex illo spurcissimo commercio foeminarum prolis desiderio laboran tium, cum Hylobiis et Heautontimoreumenis. I can, upon similar principles, account for the greatest part of the sables imputed to Me gasthenes, Daimachus, and Onesicritus. Lt. Wilford explains Ctcsias's fable of the Mar tichora. 21 What the fable is of the ants which turned up gold, and the manner of collecting it by the natives, I cannot determine ; but it is possible, that as our knowledge of India increases, it will be traced to its source ; and one thing is certain, thatat is a tale existing from the time of Herodotus to the age of De Thou ; it is countenanced likewise in the Letters of Busbequius, who saw one of these ants [skins] (an Indian ant as big as a dog, p. 318. Eng. ed.) sent as a present from the king of Persia to the Porte. See Larcher, torn. iii. p. 339.

They returned with amazement from the sight of Mussendon, while Skulax succeeded without a difficulty upon record. But the obstacles to such a voyage are numerous, first, whether Paktuia be Peukeli, and Caspaty'rus, Multan : seconds, if Dai i us were master of Multan, whether he could send a ship, or a fleet, down the Indus to the sea, though tribes where Alexander fought his way at every step : thirdly, whether Skulax24 had any knowledge of the Indian Ocean, the coast, or the monsoon : fourthly, if the coast of Gadrosia were friendly, which is doubtful, whether he could proceed alono- the coast of Arabia, which must be hostile from port to port. These and a variety of other difficulties 2S, which Nearchus ex- perienced, from famine, from want of water, from the built of his vessels, and from the manners of the natives, must induce an incredulity in regard to the Persian account, whatever respect we may have to the fidelity of Herodotus. *4 That there was such a person as Skulax, p. 35. for there is great doubt whether Rhe that he was in India, and that his account of teum was in existence in the time of the real that country was extant, appears from Aris totle's Politicks, lib.vii. in Dr. Gillies's transla tion, book iv. p . 240 . I learn likewise from Lar cher, that the Baron de Sainte Croix defends the work which now bears the name of Skulax as genuine, in a dissertation read before the Academy of Inscriptions; but I know not whe ther that dissertation be published. See Lar cher's Herod, torn. iii. p. 407. I have one ob jection to its authenticity, which is, his mention of Dardanus, Rheteum and Ilium in the Troad, Snulax ; and of India, he says nothing in the treatise now extant. 25 Strabo s ;ys, Posidonius disbelieved this whole history of Skulax, though he believed the voyage of Eudoxus, lib. ii. p. too. The fact is, there were so many of these voyages pretended, and so few performed, that the best judges did not know what to believe ; Strabo believed nothing of the circumnavigation of Africa. See lib. i. p. 32."], [44, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 16 CTESIAS. V. Next to Herodotus, at the distance of little more than sixty years, succeeds Ctesias. He resided a considerable time in the court of Persia, and was physician to Artaxerxes Mn6 mon. What opportunities he had of obtaining a knowledge of India must have been accidental, as his fables are almost pro verbial, and his truths very few ; his abbreviator Photius, from whose extracts alone we have an account of his works, seems to have passed over all that he said of Indian manners ; and to have preserved only his tales of the marvellous. The editor26, 25 Ctesias says, there is a pool which is annually filled with liquid gold ; that an hun dred measures (ffgo%o\u00abi) of this are collected, each measure weighing a talent ; at the bot tom of this pool is found iron, and of this iron he had two swords, one presented to him by the king, and the other by Parysatis the king's mother. The property of these swords was, that when fixed in the ground they averted clouds, hail, and tempests ; he saw the king make the experiment, and it succeeded. no farther support my charge of absurdity against Ctesias, than to maintain that the ne cessity of having these swords made from the iron found in the golden fountain is an absur. dity still, as we now know that all iron has the same property. This effect was not, and could not be, unknown to the ancients ; for the fire of Castor and Pollux, the St. Elmo's light, is recorded upon a variety of occasions ; and frequent notice is likewise taken of the flame on the head of spears [hastae militum arsere]. All this we now know to be electri cal. But if the Persians had learnt that in these instances iron was a conductor, and averted the mischief of lightning, they had certainly advanced one step above others in the science, and are the first electricians upon re cord. It is common to all science, that the effect is known before the cause, and the ap plication of the effect to its proper use. The pump was employed for ages before it was known that air could be weighed against water ; and the mechanick powers were all used, before their force, or the means of ex erting it to the best advantage, could be cal culated. I am therefore perfectly ready to admit Mr. Alwood's interpretation of this In regard to my former note on this pas sage, I am first to do justice to M. Wesseling, to whom 1 erroneously imputed a defence of Ctesias's veracity. I should have been cor rect, if I had imputed it to Henry Stephens's dissertation prefixed to Ctesias, in M. Wes seling's edition. I had likewise said that \" some ingenious ft modern might quote \u2022n^r^m ocitoi^vocioi, \" the expression of Ctesias, to prove that iron \" was known to be a conductor in that age, \" and that electricity was concerned in the ex \" periment.\" On this subject I received a paper from Mr. Alvvood, in which he adopts the sup position I had advanced.

The few particulars appropriate to India, and consistent with truth, obtained by Ct&sias, are almost confined to something resembling a description of the cochineal plant, the fly, and the beautiful tint obtained from it, with a genuine picture of the monkey and the parrot; the two animals he had doubtless seen in Persia, and flowered cottons emblazoned with the glowing colours of the modern chintz, were probably as much coveted by the fair Persians in the Harams of Susa and Ecbatana, as they still are by the ladies of our own country. Ctesias is contemporary with Xenophon, and Xenophon is prior to Alexander by about seventy years ; during all which period, little intelligence concerning India was brought into Greece ; and if the Macedonian conquests had not penetrated beyond the Indus, it does not appear what other means might have occurred of dispelling the cloud of obscurity in which the eastern world was enveloped. passage, and to allow that honour which he Ctesias stylet the pool Sides ; Arrian, fro\u00bb claims for the Persians of discovering this pro- Megasthenes, mentions a river and spring, perty in iron, which is in fact the greatest ad- called Silas, on which wood would not swim , vance, in point of utility, which has hitherto Strabo speaks of a Silia, p. 484. ; aud Pliny, been derived from our knowledge of the cause, of Silla.

They acquired intelligence of all the grand and leading features of Indian manners, policy, and religion : they discovered all this by penetrating through countries where possibly no Greek had previously set his foot ; and they explored the passage by sea, which first opened the commercial intercourse with India to the Greeks and Romans, through the medium of Egypt and the Red Sea ; and finally to the Europeans by the Cape of Good Hope. It matters not that the title of fabulists is conferred upon Megasthenes, Nearchus, and Onesicritus, by the ancients ; they published more truths than falsehoods, and many of their im- puted falsehoods are daily becoming truths, as our knoAvledge of the country is improved. The progress of information from this origin is materially connected with the object we have pro- posed, and it cannot be deemed superfluous to pursue it through the chain of authors, who maintain the connection till the dis- covery of the passage across the ocean by means of the mon soon. Megasthenes and Daimachus I7 had been sent as ambassadors from the kings of Syria to Sandrocottus and his successor Alli trochades ; the capital of India was in that age at Palibothra, the situation of which, so long disputed, is finally fixed28, by Sir -'Bruce says, Megasthenes and Denis, Captain Wilford, and brought to Raje Mahal, from Ptolemy jfang of Egypt, vo . u p. 46t. thirty miles abo.e the Delu of Bengal, where He follow d French authority and he .. not there is no junction of rivers, and where, if we ,n the hab, of citing h\u00bb authomies , but there fix it, we must bring a river to tie place a ,s .

These ambassadors, therefore, were resident at a court in the very heart of India, and it is to Megasthenes in particular that the Greeks are indebted for the best account of that country. But what is most peculiarly remarkable is, that the fables of Ctesias were still retained in his work; the Cynocephali, the Pigmies, and similar fables were still asserted as truths. It is for this reason that Strabo\" prefers the testimony of Erat6s thenes and Patrocles, though Eratosthenes was resident at Alexandria, and never visited India at all ; and though Pa trocles never saw any part of that country beyond the Panjeab. Still their intelligence he thinks is preferable, because Eratos thenes had the command of all the information treasured in the library of Alexandria ; and Patrocles was possessed of the ma terials which were collected by Alexander himself, and which had been communicated to him by Xeno the keeper of the archives. It is inconceivable how men could live and negotiate in a camp on the Ganges, and bring home impossibilities as truth ; how Megasthenes could report that the Hindoos had no use of letters30, when Nearchus had previously noticed the beautiful appearance of their writing, and the elegance of character, which we still discover in the Shanskreet31; but the fabulous accounts of Ctesias were repeated by Megasthenes, professedly 19 Lib. ii. in initio, p. 70. 3I Shanskreet, or Sanscrit, is the mode of 30 Strabo, lib. xv. p. 709. an imputation writing this word, which has prevailed among on Megasthenes, which the good father Paolino our English writers.

His picture is, in fact, a faithful representation of the Indian character and Indian man ners ; and modern observation contributes to establish the ex tent of his intelligence, and the fidelity of his report. This source of intelligence, commencing with Alexander and concluding with Megasthenes and Daimachus, may be classed under the title of Macedonian, as derived from Alexander and his successors : for such knowledge of the country as could be acquired by a hasty invasion, by the inspection of travellers and ambassadors, or by the voyage down the Indus, -the Mace donians seem to have attained with singular attention, and, notwithstanding particular errors, to have conveyed into Europe with much greater accuracy than might have been ex pected. The voyage of Nearchus opened the passage into India by sea, and obviated the difficulties of penetrating into the east by land, which had previously been an insurmountable barrier to knowledge and communication.

JAMBULTJS. VI. The mention of Ceylon naturally introduces us to the V037age of lambulus34, because, fabulous as his account is, it is still most probably founded on fact, and because Diodorus has ranked it as history. Lucian 3S, perhaps, formed a better judgment when he classed him Avith the writers of fiction ; for his account of the Fortunate Islands and that of Ceylon stand almost on the same ground; the circumference of the Island he seems to give at five thousand stadia from Onesicritus, and the navigation across the ocean from Ethiopia he derived from the general knowledge that this voyage had* been performed, or imputed, from a very early Palesimoondus. This, however, ought not to be asserted without giving due weight to Paolino, who derives Palesimoondus from Pa rashri mandala, the kingdom of Parashri, and Parashri is the Indian Bacchus. to 1250 miles, and the error was always on the increase till the time of Ptolemy.

Notwithstanding all this there are some allusions to character istick truths, which though they do not bespeak the testimony of an eye-witness, prove that some knowledge of the island had reached Egypt, and this at a time previous to the discovery of the monsoon ; for lambulus must be antecedent to Dioddrus, and Diodorus is contemporary with Augustus. It is this single circumstance that makes it requisite to notice such an author. The truths alluded to are, I. The stature of the natives, and the flexibility of their joints. II. The length of their ears, bored and pendent. III. The perpetual verdure of the trees. IV. The attachment of the natives to astronomy. V. Their worship of the elements, and particularly the sun and moon. VI. Their cotton garments. VII. The custom of many men having one wife in common, and the children being entitled to the protec tion of the partnership. (This practice is said by Paolino \" to \" <b,?J\\\\r,i, though there be nothing in this word to raise admiration in general, but at the strangeness of the circumstance, how a king of Palibothra should know enough of Greeks to be fond of the nation : there is still a secret allusion of much curiosity, which is this, the native chiefs who raised themselves to inde pendence on the ruins of the Syrian monarchy, (whether from the number of Greeks in the east, or from the popularity of the Grecian sovereignty, is hard to determine,) assumed the title of *i?.i'x\\\u00bbv ; and this term is still found inscribed in Greek letters upon the coins of the first usurpers of the Parthian dynasty. See Bayer, p. 105. It seems, therefore, highly pro- babie, that the inventor of this tale of lam bulus knew that some of the eastern poten tates were styled lovers of the Greeks ; and he has ignorantly applied this title to a sovereign of India, which appertained properly to those only who reigned in the north of Persia. This seems an additional proof of the im posture ; the author knew a curious piece of secret history, but did not know how to apply it. 37 Paolino was a Romish missionary in Tra vencore for thirteen or fourteen years ; his work was published at Rome : he is sometimes mistaken on classical questions, but still it is a learned and instructive work, p. 378."], [51, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 23 exist still on the coast of Ceylon, and is apparently conformable to the manners of the Nayres on the continent.)

And it is sub mitted to future inquiry, whether the particulars of the alpha bet may not have some allusion to truth ; for he says, the characters are originally only seven, but by four varying forms or combinations they become twenty-eight. The chief reason to induce a belief, that lambulus never really visited Ceylon, is, that he should assert he was there seven years, and }ret that he should not mention the production of cinnamon. There is no one circumstance that a Greek would have noticed with more ostentation than a discovery of the coast where this spice grew ; but lambulus, like the rest of his countrymen, if he knew the produce, adjudged it to Arabia, and never thought of this leading truth, as a sanction to the construction of his fable ; he is described by Diodorus as the son of a merchant, and a merchant himself, but possessed of a liberal education. In trading to Arabia for spices, he was taken prisoner and reduced to slavery ; he was carried off from Arabia by the Ethiopians, and by them committed to the ocean, to be driven wherever the winds might carry him ; and in this case his reaching Ceylon would be the least impro- bable 38 part of his narrative. No means occur to settle the date of. this history, but the allusion to known truths makes it < 36 P.

These truths could have been obtained only from report in the age of Diodorus39, and the wonder is, that it contains a circumstance dependent on the monsoon, of which Diodorus was himself ignorant, and which was not known to the Greeks and Romans till near a century later. I dare not claim it as a proof, that the Arabians sailed by the monsoon at this time, but the scene is laid in Arabia, and the passage is made from the coast of Africa, as that of the Arabians really was ; and it is natural to conclude, that the Arabians did really sail to Ceylon in that age, though the Greeks and Romans did not. The embassy from Pandion to Augustus cannot be a fiction, and the ambassadors must have sailed from India, either on board Arabian ships, which fre quented their harbours, or in Indian vessels which followed the same course. All this is previous to Hippalus, and the whole taken together is a confirmation of an Arabian navigation pre vious to that from Egypt.

AgathaTiChides41, the next object of our considera tion, is an author of far different estimation ; he was president of the Alexandrian library, and is always mentioned with respect by Strabo, Pliny, and Diodorus *\\ His work on the Erythrean or Red Sea, is preserved in an extract of Photius, and copied almost in the same terms, but not without inter mixture43, by Diodorus. Diod6rus indeed professes to derive his information from the royal commentaries, and original visitors of the countries he describes ; but that he copies Aga tharchides is evident, by a comparison of this part of his work with the extract of Photius ; or, perhaps, considering Agathir chides as librarian, he conceived that his work was founded on the commentaries or archives of the Alexandrian depository. Strabo44 likewise follows Agatharchides in almost all that relates to Ethiopia, the countries south of Egypt, and the western coast of Arabia4', or rather, as Wesseling has observed, with *\" It is with much regret that I confess my neglect of this author, from whom I might have corroborated many circumstances in the voyage of Nearchus.

It is necessary to pay more attention to this author, as he is apparently the original source from which all the historians drew, previous to the discovery of the monsoon ; his work forms an epoch in the science, and when Pliny comes to speak of the discoveries on the coast of Malabar in his own age* and adds, that the names he mentions are new, and not to be found in previous writers ; we ought to consider him as speak ing of all those, who had followed the authority of the Mace donians, or the school of Alexandria, of which, in this branch of science, Eratosthenes and Agatharchides were the leaders. Eratosthenes ** was librarian of Alexandria under Ptolemy Euergetes I. and died at the age of eighty-one, 194, A. C. He was rather an astronomer and mathematician than a geographer, and is honoured with the title of surveyor of the earth 49, as the first astronomer who measured a degree of a great circle s\u00b0, and drew the first parallel of latitude, the sublime attempt on which all the accuracy of the science depends.

His information concerning India must be deduced from the Macedonians, but his information is confined on the subject of Oriental commerce ; the spherical figure of the earth seems to be the grand truth he was desirous to establish, and his geo graphical inquiries were perhaps rather the basis of a system, than a delineation of the habitable world. Agatharchides, according to Blair, must, though younger, have been contemporary with Eratosthenes ; he was a native of Cnidus in Caria, and flourished 177, A. C. But Dodwell Sj brings him down much lower, to 104, A. C. which can hardly be true, if Artemidorus54 copied his wfcrk, for the date of Ar temidorus is attributed to 104, A.

His account of the coast is our more immediate concern ; this commences at Arsinoe, or Suez, and goes down the western side of the Red Sea to Ptolem&is Theron60, it mentions Muos Hormus, but takes no notice of Berenike. The particulars of this navigation are very scanty, but still one fact is substan tiated, that the ordinary course of trade carried on, went no lower than Ptolemais, and was confined more especially to the importation of elephants. Ptolemais is the Ras Ahehaz of d'Anville, the Has Ageeg of Bruce, in latitude 18\u00b0 10s\", and full three hundred and fifty miles short of the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. A proof that whatever Ptolemy Philadelphus had discovered of the coast of Africa,, it was now little visited by the fleets from Egypt, but I have examined the dissertation of Barthe lcmi. aid find that he supposes it an offering of one _Hermaiscus, a freedman of Hadrian, and a Greek, at Pr\u00e6n- ste, in memory of Had rian's visit to Egypt ; and that the figure in the front of the temp e is Hadrian received by the city of Elephantine, and the scenery repre sents the season of the ii undation. But there is one circumstance Barthelcmi has paid little attention to, which is, that the buildings are Greek or Roman, rather than Egyptian. This seems a direct proof that the Mosaick was exe cuted in Italy, upon Egyptian information, and after Egyptian memoirs ; and this is, per haps, the reason why so little resemblance to nature is found in the animals : they are taken from the description in books, not from life or drawings of life ; and such descriptions as these are found in Agatharchides, and those who copied him, as Diodorus, Strabo, &c. There is in the representation of the Mo saick a perfect distinction between the figures which are Roman, Greek, or Egyptian, and those which are Ethiopian ; and there is like wise in all probability a just representation of the penteconterus, (\u00bb. e. the galley of fifty oars, for that number it has,) and not a trireme, as Barthelcmi calls it, with the Pha seli, Coricles, Sec. &c. of the natives of all descriptions. But query, whether Anubis is ever represented in any genuine Egyptian monument as here, like a dog ? Is not Latrator Anubis a man with a dog's head ? a proof that this Mosaick is not Egyptian. 60 So called from \u00a9115a, because the ele phants were here hunted and taken ; they are so still according to Bruce, and below this cape, de la Rochette places the commence ment of a vast forest, seen by all vessels which, keep this coast.

Below this, Agatharchides, or his abbreviator, afford little information, for we are carried almost at once to two moun tains, called the Bulls and Ptolemais Theron, without any in tervening circumstance but the danger of shoals, to which the elephant ships from Ptolemais66 are exposed : of these shoals there are many about Suakem in de la Rochette, though Bruce denies the existence of a single one on the whole western coast of the Red Sea.

At Ptolemais the account closes, as if there were no regular commerce below that point ; but its existence has been evinced by what is here said, and will be farther confirmed from the Adulitick marble in its proper place ; the total silence of Agatharchides, in regard to Berenike, unless it be an omission of his abbreviator, is still more unaccountable ; it appears, in deed, as if the caravan road from Coptus to this place, was a much greater object of attention under the Roman government than under the Ptolemies. The accounts extant are all Roman; from Pliny, from the Itinerary, and from the Peutingerian tables ; but the Greek authorities ma}7 have perished, and Strabo mentions two different states of these roads ; one from Coptus to Berenike as it was first opened by Philadelphus, and another from Coptus to Muos Hormus, after it was furnished with wells and reservoirs, and protected by a guard. Are we then to think that this, after being opened, was neglected again, when Agatharchides wrote? or are we to suppose that Berenike is comprehended in the mention of Muos Hormus67 ? for Berenike is no harbour65, but an open bay, and the ships which lade there, lie at Muos Hormus till their cargo is read}'.

In this course of great obscurity, there is no occasion at present to pursue the track throughout, as it will be resumed in the third book, when the account of the Periplus is to be examined, and such light as is to be collected from other geographers will be adduced, in order to elucidate the narrative, which is the first genuine account of Arabia that is extant. Neither is it un worthy of notice, that the Periplils itself is constructed upon the plan of Agatharchides ; it goes down the western coast of the gulph in the same manner, then returns back to Muos Hor mus, and crosses over to the eastern side, and pursues that line to its conclusion ; the difference between the two consists in the difference of knowledge in the respective ages. Agatharchides describes the trade as it stood in the age of Philometor. The Periplus carries it to the extent it had obtained under the pro tection of the Roman emperors ; but both set out from the same point for both voyages, and it is only the extension of the line which constitutes the distinction. But it is our immediate business to proceed to the country of the Sabeans, called Arabia the Happy, from its wealth, its commerce, and its produce, either native or imputed. This province answers generally to the modern Yemen'0, and the Sabeans of our author's age possessed the key to the Indian commerce, and stood as the intermediate agents between Eo-ypt and the East. This is a most valuable fact, which we obtain 70 Yemen and Sabea express identically the Arabic, is equivalent ; for in their view the same thing ; for both signify the south, and right hand is the south, and the left hand the this province is in the south of Arabia.

Certain it is that the wealth assigned to this nation is a proof of the existence of a commerce, which has enriched all who have stood in this situation, and equally certain is it that the inform ation of the author ceases at the succeeding step. Sabea, says Agatharchides, abounds with every production to make life happy in the extreme, its very air is so perfumed with odours, that the natives are obliged to mitigate the frag rance by scents that have an opposite tendency, as if nature could not support even pleasure in the extreme. Myrrh, frank incense, balsam, cinnamon, and casia are here produced from trees of extraordinary magnitude. The king, as he is on the one hand entitled to supreme honour, on the other is obliged to sub mit to confinement in his palace; but the people are robust71, warlike, and able mariners ; they sail in very large vessels to the country where the odoriferous commodities are produced, they plant ?2 colonies there, and import from thence the larimna n, an odour no where else to be found ; in fact there is no nation upon earth so wealthy as the Gerrheans and Sabeans, from their situation in the centre of all the commerce which passes 74 between '* So Bruce, vol. i. p. 408. quotes Isaiah, xlv. 14.

These are the nations which have enriched the Syria75 of Ptolemy; these are the nations that furnish the most profitable agencies to the industry of the Phenicians, and a variety of advantages which are incalculable. They possess themselves every profusion of luxury, in articles of plate and sculpture, in furniture of beds, tripods, and other household embellishments, far superior in degree to any thing that is seen in Europe. Their expence of living rivals the magnificence of princes 76. Their houses are decorated with pillars glistening with gold and silver. Their doors are crowned with vases and beset with jewels ; the interior of their houses corresponds to the beauty of their outward appearance, and all the riches of other countries are here exhibited in a variety of profusion77.

Erom this narrative, reported almost in the words of the author, a variety of considerations arise, all worthy of atten tion. It is, as far as I can discover, the first contemporary ac count of the commerce opened between Egypt and India, by the medium of Arabia; it proves that in the reign of Ptolemy Philometor, in the year 177, A. C. and 146 years after the death of Alexander, the Greek sovereigns in Egypt had not yet traded directly to India, but imported the commodities of India from Saba the capital of Yemen ; that the port of Berenike was not used for .this commerce, but that Muos Hormus, or Arsinoe, was still the emporium. It proves that there was no trade down the coast of Africa (an intercourse afterwards of great import ance) except for elephants, and that no lower than Ptolem&is Theron. It shews that the voyage down the Arabian coast of the Red Sea was still very obscure, and above all it demon strates incontestably by the wealth constantly attendant on all who have monopolised the Indian commerce, that the mono poly in the author's age was in Sabea. The Sabeans of Yemen are compared with the Gerrheans on the Gulph of Persia ; and both appear connected with the Ph\u0153nicians by means of Petra and the Elanitick Gulph; and with the Greeks in Egypt, by Arsinoe. and Muos Hormus. I am not ignorant that the establishment of a trade with India is attributed to Ptolemy Philadelphus73, that the immense re- 78 See Harris's Voyages, vol. i. booki. c. 2. as Harris's, but this part of it, in the second compared with p. 421.

But this last evidence, which is deemed conclusive, admits of an easy solution ; for Indian was a word of almost as extensive signification in that age, as the present; it comprehended the Cafres of Africa, as well as the handsome Asiatick blacks, and the commerce with Arabia was long called the Indian trade, before the Greeks of Egypt found their way to India. But if real Indians were a part of the procession, they were obtained in Sab6a. The Arabians dealt in slaves, and the Greeks might find Indian slaves in their market as well as any other. Huet, Robertson, and Harris are all very desirous of finding a trade with India under the Ptolemies; but the two latter, as they approach the real age, when this commerce took place, upon the discovery of Hippalus, fully acknowledge, that all proofs of a more early existence of it are wanting ; no contemporary author asserts it : and the testimony of Agatharchides, whether we place him in 377, or with Dodwell, in 104, A. C. affords perfect evidence to the contrary. The internal evidence of the work itself carries all the appearance of genuine truth, and copied as it is by Strabo and Dioddrus it obtains additional authority Ts. They have both added particulars, but none which prove a direct communication with India in their own age. They both ter- and is executed most ably. I am obliged to him for many references to authors, which 1 have it not in my power always to acknow ledge.

Whatever knowledge of India, or Indian trade, they have beyond this, is such only as they derived from the Mace donians, and is totally distinct from the communication between Egypt and that country. In regard to the influx of wealth into Egypt, it would be equally the same, whether the Greeks imported Indian com modities from Arabia or from India direct. For as the Sabeans were possessed of the monopoly between India and Egypt, so Egypt would enjoy the same monopoly between Sabea and- Europe. The consumers, indeed, must bear the burden of this double monopoly, but the intermediate agents in both instances would be gainers, and the profits, while the trade was a monopoly, would be, as they always have been, enormous. The sove reigns of Egypt were well apprized of this, and so jealous were they of this prerogative of their capital, that no goods could pass through Alexandria either to India or Europe, without the intervening agency of an Alexandrian factor. In the description which Agatharchides gives of Sabea there is nothing inconsistent with probability ; neither is this the boundary of his knowledge towards the east, for he mentions several other particulars which I had censured too rashly as fabulous in my former edition, but which I have since learnt from better information to acknowledge as truths ; and from which, besides doing justice to the author, I can deduce some inferences of importance. The first is the singular appearance"], [66, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS, 38 of the sea beyond the limits of Sabea, which he describes as white as a river. This is perfectly correct, if we form to our selves the idea of a turbid stream bringing down a white or chalky substance from the soil through which it passes ; for the sea between Socotra and Hadramaut 8o assumes this appearance, as we learn from the testimony of Terry, Corsali, and a variety of modern81 navigators81. But it is not sufficient to do justice to the veracity of the author; for we may collect from this, that the ships from Egypt did actually pass the straits, and visit the ports on the ocean, such as Aden or Kaneh, or even some more remote : for to verify this fact, they must reasonably be sup posed to have seen the phenomenon. Here then we may con clude that the merchants saw those large\"3 ships which the author notices as coming from the Indus, Patala, Persis, and Karmania, perfectly in correspondence with the commerce of the age. Other circumstances recorded in the same work are, that in that climate there is no twilight, which 1 originally acknow ledged to be an illustrious truth ; and that the sun rises not like a disk, but a column, casting no shadow till it is an hour above the horizon. This was a fact of which I expressed a doubt; 80 \" Between Socotra and Arabia you have \" white water twenty leagues off shore.\" Dalrymple's Collection, p. 57. 83 The ships which carried the trade between Guzerat and Arabia, in the 16th and 17th century, were of vast bulk. Captain Saris measured those he detained in the Red Sea ; the largest was 153 feet from stem to stern, breadth 42, height 31, burden 12oo tons; the main-mast 108 feet high, the main-yard 132.

This indeed is in a high northern latitude, not com parable perhaps with a phenomenon on the coast of Arabia : but that the sun casts no shadow at his first appearance is con firmed by Cadamosto H, who says, that though the sun is visible, he affords no light for the first half hour, and seems as if he were eclipsed at his first rising. I should have been glad to find a confirmation of this in any modern navigator, but my research has not been attended with success. Possibly it is a circum stance well known to astronomers, and accounted for by laws of refraction, with which I am unacquainted. A more extra ordinary effect is added, that the evening twilight lasts three hours after sunset. Of this I should be happy to receive a so lution ; for though it is not consonant to reason or experience, it probably depends upon some deception which those who are acquainted with those regions may explain. It is a pleasure to have obtained a better knowledge of these particulars myself, and a satisfaction to do justice to an author whose fidelity I had questioned. The marvellous in classical writers is daily diminishing, as we acquire a more intimate knowledge of the east ; and as our information increases, there may remain little that is fabulous, or where the fable may not be traced in its origin to a connexion with truth. If it should now be inquired how the commerce with India could be in this state so late as the reign of Ptolemy Philometor, or wdiy the discoveries of Nearchus had not in all this time been 84 Verum licet sol videatur non tamen illu- pati deliquium in ortu.

The fleets from Egypt found the commodities of India in Arabia, and the merchants contented themselves with buying in that market, without en tering upon new adventures to an unknown coast. There is every reason to suppose that Sabea had been the centre of this commerce long prior to the discoveries of Nearchus, and the age of Alexander ; and it is highly probable that the Arabians had even previous 3s to that period ventured across the ocean with the monsoon. That they reached India is certain, for Indian commodities found their way into Egypt, and there is no conveyance of them so obvious as by means of Arabia and the Red Sea. The track of Arabian navigators is undoubtedly marked along the coast of Gadrosia, before Nearchus ventured to explore it, for the names he found there are many of them Arabick ; and if conjecture in such a case be allowable, I should suppose that they kept along the coast of Gadrosia to Guadel or Possem, and then stood out to sea for the coast of Guzerat or Malabar. My reason for supposing this is, that Nearchus found a pilot at Possem, which implies previous navigation, and adds, that from that cape to the Gulph of Persia the coast was not so obscure as from the Indus to the cape. But if Nearchus reported this, or if the commentaries in the Alexandrian library contained any correspondent information, how could Agatharchides be ignorant of the navigation beyond Sabea ? He was not ignorant of Nearchus's expedition, for he es Harris, i. e. Dr. Campbell, Bruce, and cident, he would readily find the means of Robertson all subscribe to this opinion, and returning by an Arabian vessel, he would like from this fact a strong degree of probability wise learn the nature of the monsoon.

He mentions expressly the manner of catching fish, as de scribed by Nearchus, within nets extended along the shoals upon the coast86, and the habitations of the natives formed from the bones of the whale. He notices the ignorance and brutal manners of the natives, their dress, habits, and modes of life ; and one circumstance he records, which he could not have ex tracted from Nearchus, which is that beyond the straits which separate Arabia from the opposite coast, (meaning, perhaps, the entrance to the Gulph of Persia,) there are an infinite num ber of scattered islands very small and very low, and extended along the sea which washes India and Gadrosia87, where the natives have no other means of supporting life but by the turtles which are found there in great abundance and of a prodigious size. I have thought it necessary not to omit this circumstance, because it appears to me as the first notice, however obscure, c-f the Maldives or Lackdives 8S, called the islands of Limurike in the Periplus, and distinguished particularly as producing the finest tortoise-shell in the world.

In that sense the fact is curious, and connected with the object in view at present, which is to collect the in formation of contemporary writers, before we proceed to the particulars of the navigation. Some extravagances or improbabilities which contaminate several parts of this account in Agatharchides, have been dis regarded by design ; where knowledge ends fable commences and much lenity of judgment is due to all writers who speak of distant countries for the first time, or by report. This author does not distinctly mark his Icthuophagi. They are not merely those, of Gadrosia, but others also apparently on the coast of Arabia or Africa9'. Regions, it is true, where fish rather than bread has ever been the staff of life, and where it continues so jit the present hour. Let any reader advert to the manner in which he speaks of the passage out of the Red Sea into the ocean, and he cannot fail to observe, that by giving the African coast an easterly direction, without notice of its falling down to the south, the commerce of that day had not yet passed cape Guardasui. Single ships X or a few in company, might have doubled that promontory and stood to the south, and others of the same description might even have reached India. Some obscure accounts from these were possibly conveyed to Alex- 89 As are the Icthuophagi of Herodotus, lib. iii. p. 203. ed. Wessel. attributes the first mention of Cerne or Mada gascar. But what is here asserted is meant only to say, that no trade on that coast existed in consequence of this discovery, as late as Agatharchides ; and even in the age of the Periplus the trade reaches no farther than Rhaptum and Menuthias, or Zanguebar, in. south lat. 6\u00b0 o' o\". whereas the north point of Madagascar is in lat. 120 o' o\". Ptolemy also only goes to Prasum, lat. 15\u00b0 o' 0\". \u00bb\u00b0 It is everywhere apparent, that Ptolemy Philadelphus was more ardent in discovery than his successors. The Greeks who had been in Abyssinia, as recorded by Pliny, vi. 35. were all possibly sent by him, as Dalion, Aris tocreon, Bion, Basilis, and Simonides ; and Timosthenes his admiral had certainly gone down the coast of Africa j for to him Pliny"], [71, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 43 andria, and from that source might have been recorded by Agatharchides, but these are all very d isle rent from his descrip tion of Sabea, and comparatively vague or obscure. Of the trade to Sabea he speaks distinctly, as a regular established commerce; so far his knowledge was genuine, beyond that it is precarious. This is an opinion collected from a full con sideration of the work itself, and I would rather wish to di minish the number of his errors, than impute those to him which are not his due. It has been thought of importance to detail these particulars from Agatharchides, because he is the genuine source from which Diod6rus, Strabo, Pliny91, Pomponius Mela, and others have derived their information. Diodorus lived in the begin ning of the reign of Augustus. He has copied the whole of Agatharchides, so far as relates to the Icthuophagi, Troglodytes, Ethiopians, and Arabians, in his third book. Strabo, who lived to the end of Augustus's reign 9% has followed Agathar- \u00bb' Pliny rather accords with Agatharchides than copies him ; he seems to have gone to the source ; \u2014 those Greeks I mean who entered Ethiopia in the age of Philadelphus. See lib. vi. 35. Cicero, in Corneliana, ut citatus ad Am. mianum, p. 306. Paris ed. 16S1. But attend only to the merchants who followed the armies, who fixed in the provinces subdued or allied, the Italici generis homines, who were agents, traders, and monopolists, 6uch as Juo-urtha took in Zama, or the 100,000 that Mithri dates slaughtered in Asia Minor, or the mer chants killed at Genabum [Orleans], C\u00e6sar Bell.

Dr. Campbell, in his Po. litical Survey, has proved their conduct on this matter in regard to Britain, and the present work will give a most extraordinary specimen of it in Egypt. 92 The Romans do not appear a commer cial people, because their great officers and their historians are too much attached to war, and the acquisition of power, to notice it. All, therefore, that we hear of commerce is obliquely, but the wealth of merchants was proverbial. (See Horace, lib. iii. od. 6. 1. 30.

He extends, indeed, the navigation down the coast of Africa with Artemidorus ; but on the east, he stops at Sab\u00a3a with his author. On the coast of Gadrdsia he has followed Nearchus more faithfully than Agatharchides, but has no men tion of the Lackdive Islands; and the little he says of Tapro bana, is a proof that it was known by report, but not yet visited. Pliny and Pomponius Mela in many detached parts tread the same ground, and copy the same author. But if Agatharchides lived under Ptolemy Philometor, it is natural to ask, had nothing been done during 170 years, to wards further discovery by the fleets that sailed annually from Egypt ? The answer is, that whatever was done is not re corded ; the course of discovery was doubtless in progression ; but there is a great difference between effecting the discovery, and bringing it into general knowledge, or making it a part of history. It is possible, also, that the sovereigns of Egypt were more jealous of the trade than ambitious of the honour ; and the later princes were more likely to cramp commerce by extor tion, than to favour it by protection. The Phenicians had manifestly a share in the profits from its commencement, and it was not unlikely that the Romans might have felt this as an ad ditional incentive for the subjugation of Egypt, if they had been fully informed of the means it afforded for adding to the wealth and aggrandisement of the republic. It is not meant, therefore, to deny the extension of the voyages progressively, either to the east or the south ; for as long as there was any vigour in the government of Alexandria,"], [73, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 45 the trade on the Red Sea was a favoured object. We learn from Strabo and Diodorus, a circumstance not mentioned in Agatharchides, and probably later than his age, that the Na batheans at the head of the gulph had molested the fleet from Egypt by their piracies, and had been suppressed by a naval force fitted out for that purpose. This, at the same time it proves the attention of the Egyptian government to this trade, proves likewise that the fleets still crossed the gulph from Muos Hormus or Berenike, and did not strike down at once to Moosa or Okelis, as they did in the age of the Periplus. This mark of attention also adds highly to the probability, that some progress had been made to the south, down the coast of Africa ; for there, from the first mention of it, there seems always to have been a mart for Indian commodities ; and the port of Mosyllon, as appears afterwards by the Peri pi its, was a rival to Sabea or Hadramaut. Mosyllon was under the power of the Arabian king of Maphartis, in the same manner as the Portuguese found that nation masters of the coast of Africa, fifteen centuries later, and the convenience of these possessions to the Arabs is self-evident ; for as vessels coming with the monsoon, for the Gulph of Persia make Maskat, so those bound for Hadramaut or Aden run down their longitude to the coast of Africa ; here, therefore, from the earliest period that the monsoons were known to the Arabians, perhaps much prior to Alexander, there would be marts for Indian commodities; and here it is highly probable the fleets from Egypt found them, when the Sabeans were too high in their demands. That this commerce had taken place soon after the time of Agatharchides may be collected from Strabo, who cites Ar temidorus to prove that there was a trade on the coast of Africa"], [74, "46 PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. as low as the Southern Horn. He mentions, indeed, that at the straits\" of the Red Sea the cargo was transferred from ships to boats or rafts, which, though it manifests that the naviga tion was only at its commencement, still proves its existence. He does not name Mosyllon, but the Periplus, by noticing that several articles were, called Mosyllitick, demonstrates, that a commerce had been carried on at that port previous to its own age, and that Indian commodities were sought on that coast before they were brought immediately from India. If there were such a mart, this must be a necessary event, for in the first instance the trade of Sabea was a monopoly, and if the sovereigns of Aden or Maphartis had opened the commerce, either in their own country or Africa, it would draw a resort thither as soon as the port could be known, or the voyage to it be effected. The date of this transaction it is impossible to ascertain, but a variety of circumstances concur to shew that it had taken place previous to the discovery of the monsoon by Hippalus. HIPPALUS. VIII. The discovery of Plippalus opens a scene entirely new to our contemplation ; and if it has appeared that hitherto there are only two sources of information, the Macedonians and Aga tharchides ; if it has been shewn that all the authors between Agatharchides and the discovery, speak the same language ; it will now be still more evident, that a new era commences at this point, and that the Periplus, Pliny, and Ptolemy areas \u25a0 See Bay Avalites, infra."], [75, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 47 uniform in one system as their predecessors were in another, previous to the discovery. Dodwell has observed, with his usual acuteness, that it is no proof that the Periplus is contemporary with the age of Pliny, because he mentions the same sovereigns, in the different countries of which it treats ; for he adds, Ptolemy notices the very same, Keprobotas in Limurike and Pandion in Malabar. Lie supposes, therefore, that the Periplus copied Pliny or Pliny's authorities, and that the same princes might be reigning from the time of Vespasian to the reign of Adrian. But would not this correspondence of the three be equally consistent, if we suppose them all to have but one source of information ? Dod well would subscribe to this in regard to Pliny and Ptolemy, whose ,age is known, but he refuses this solution to that of the Periplus, the date of which he chooses to bring down as low as Verus. Of this more in its proper place. The truth is, that there are no data for fixing the discovery of Hippalus with precision. It is certainly subsequent to Strabo whose death is placed9*, anno 25. P. C. for Strabo who was in Egypt with Elius Gallus must have heard of it, and to all ap- pearance it must have been later than the accident, which hap- pened to the freedman of Annius Plokamus, who, while he was collecting the tribute on the coast of Arabia, was caught by the monsoon and carried over to the island of Ceylon. This hap pened in the reign of Claudius, under Avhom Plokamus was farmer of the revenue in the Red Sea.

Let us assume the middle of his reign, or the year 47, for this transaction, and as Pliny dedicates his work to Titus the son of Vespasiau, if we take the middle of Vespasian's reign it coincides with the year ?'3 9S. This reduces the space for in quiry within the limits of twenty-six years. From these we may detract the first years of Vespasian, which were too tur bulent for attention to commerce, with the two years of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius ; Nero reigned fourteen, and in the early part of his reign, or the six last, of Claudius, the date might be fixed with the greatest probability, because, if we suppose the return of the freedman of Plokamus, the embassy that accom panied him, or the knowledge he acquired to be a cause, or in any degree connected with the discovery, this space confined to about ten years is the most consistent of all others, to allot to this purpose95. Another fact connected with this is, the pro fusion of Nero in cinnamon and aromaticks, at the funeral of Poppea97. An extravagance, wanton as it is, which bespeaks something like a direct importation of the material. And we are likewise informed by Pliny, that he sent two centurions from Egypt up into Ethiopia to obtain a knowledge of the interior ; an inquiry naturally attached to the discoveries on the coast. *' Salmasius says, 77. 830 anno urbis con dit\u00e6, p. 1 1 86.

Dodwell and Harris are both of this opinion, and the latter, or rather Dr. Campbell his editor, has treated this subject so ably, that if it were not necessary for the illustra tion of the work before us, it would have been sufficient to refer to his inquiries, rather than to tread the ground again which he has occupied. Let us assume then the seventh year of Clau dius '*, answering to the forty-seventh of the Christian era, for the discovery of Hippalus, and the next object of inquiry will naturally be the date of the work which we are to examine. AGE OF THE AUTHOR OF THE PERIPLUS. IX. The learned Dodwell and Salmasius affix two very dif ferent dates to the Peripltis, and between two such able dis putants it is easier to chuse than decide. My own observations lead me to prefer the opinion of Salmasius, but not so peremp torily as to suppose the question cleared of all its difficulties, and there is a hint dropt by Dodwell, that I should wish to adopt, if I were not covinced that the author of the Periplus speaks of Hippalus as a distinct person. Dodwell supposes that the work w^as compiled by some Alex andrian*' from the journal of Hippalus; and so far it is just to allow, that the parallel information in Pliny and the Periplus 98 Dodwell says, in primis annis Claudii, and supposes that Pliny takes his account of Hippalus from a work which Claudius himself wrote ; certain it is, that the memory of Claudius was revered by the Alexandrians, and not improbably by reason of this discovery and the prosecution of it. \" Certe Hippali persons: conveniunt ex amussim hujus itinerarii not\u00e6.

PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. does not appear so properly to be copied by either from the other, as from some authority common to both. But that the author, whatever he copied, was a navigator or a merchant himself, cannot be denied, when we find him speaking in the first person upon some occasions, and when we read his account of the tides in the gulph of Cambay, which is too graphical to come from any pen but that of an eye-witness. This author and Pliny agree in the description of Hadra maut100 and Sabbatha, in the names of the kings and of the ports on the coast of Malabar, as Muziris and Cottonara, and of the Sinthus ; in the departure of the fleets from Okelis and Kane, and a variety of other circumstances ; but their most re markable correspondence is in their history of the Spikenard and Costus101; both mention the Ganges and Ozene; as the marts for the former, and the Pattal\u00a3ne for the. latter. The intelli gence is undoubtedly the same in both, and yet there is no ab solute proof that either copied from the other. But those who are acquainted with Pliny's method of abbreviation would much rather conclude, if one must be a copyist, that his title to this office is the clearest. Wherever we can trace him to the authorities he follows, we find that narratives are contracted into. 103 'YirtgKti7Cti di \u00abU7^ ptcroyiio; n MirrgoiroXic: XocQu&a. ev n xal i Karoixu, 7ra\u00a3 tT o yvirJi fj.mo; Iv 711 Xu'i?- XiQxio?

This ap pears to me fully ascertained in the present instance, but con clusions of this sort are not hastily to be adopted. Pliny perished in the eruption of Vesuvius the same year that Vespasian died, which is the seventy-ninth of our era ; and if we place the discovery of Hippalus in forty-seven, a space of thirty years is sufficient for the circumstances of the voyage, and the trade to be known in Egypt ; from whence to Rome the propagation of intelligence is more natural than the reverse. But if we should be disposed, with Dodwell, to carry the date of the Periplils down to the reign of Marcus and Lucius Verus IO% that commenced in l6l ; and at the distance of al most a century, its correspondence with Pliny is by no means equally consistent. The strength of Dodwell's argument lies in the report of the Periplils, cocerning the destruction of Arabia Felix, or Aden ,0J, by the Romans ; and the mention of the coast of Africa being subject to the sovereign of Maphartis, king of the first10* Arabia. The title of first or second annexed to a province, is a division which certainly seems of later date under the emperors, than any period that would suit the system of Salmasius ; but there is reason to suspect the text, or the rendering of it ; and ,M The passage in the Periplus runs thus : Ka.eiGz.-v>. .... <7v\u00abxeV\u00bb v^iaGitais xal li^on QiXo; van au-roxfaTojiiv' p. 13, that is, Charibael king of Saphar, is upon friendly terms with the Roman emperors, and receives presents and embassies from them. The word emperors, in the plural, induces Dodwell to carry down the date till he meets with two joint emperors reigning together. That a plural does not require this we may learn from Diony'sius Pe- rieg. who says of Rome, e^Sil fiiyou fixo* ivaxiw, whence Barthius draws a similar conclusion, that Diony'sius lived under the Antonines ; but Pliny writes, Dionysium, quem in orientem pr\u00e6misit Divus Augustus, lib. vi. 27. a clear proof that Diony'sius lived under Augustus. This argument is from Vossius, Prasf. ad Dionys. Perieg. ,c! Page 15. 104 Page 10. H 2"], [80, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 52 no authority which appears sufficient to prove that the territory of Maphartis ever was a Roman province in any age ; or even if it might be so called, as being tributary, no reason can be given why it should be distinguished as the first. In regard to the destruction of Aden by Cesar, the author of the Periplus says IC5, it happened not long before his time. But what Cesar this should be is a great difficulty. Dodwell, who supposes that it must be by some Cesar who destroyed it in person, can find no emperor to whom it can be attributed prior to Trajan. But Trajan never was on the southern coast of Arabia; he entered the country from the Gulph of Persia, but never penetrated to the southern coast by land, and never ap proached it from the Gulph of Arabia. It is much more just, therefore, to conclude that Aden ,0<s was destroyed by the com mand of Cesar, than by Cesar in person ; and if so, any Cesar \"* whose age will coincide with other circumstances may be as sumed. Many probabilities conspire to make us conclude tnat this was Claudius. The Romans, from the time they first entered Arabia under Elius Gallus, had always maintained a footing on the coast of the Red Sea. They bad a garrison at Leuke Kome in Na bathea10', where they collected the customs, and it is apparent that they extended their powers down the gulph, and to the \"* Page 15. son from Pliny, but has no reference to this city, Aden ; for the\" sentence is, Gallus oppida diruit non nominata ab autoribus qui ante scripserunt : and he then names them Egra [Negra], Annestus, Esca [Asca], Magusus, Tammacus, Lacbecia, Mariaba, Caripeta..

If we add to this the discovery of Hippalus in the same reign, we find a better reason for the destruction of Aden at this time, than at any other. Aden had been one of the great marts for the Indian commerce, and if Claudius, or the prefect of Egypt, was now disposed to appro priate this trade to the Romans, this was a sufficient cause for ruining Aden, in order to suppress rivals or interlopers. The jealousy or opposition of Aden to the new discovery would naturally afford ground for quarrel, and if not, the Romans knew how to provoke one whenever it suited their interest. These considerations are offered as a probable answer to the weightiest of Dod well's arguments; his long and tedious dis quisition concerning Palesimoondus, will defeat itself. It stands thus : having determined that the age df the Periplds must be that of Marcus and Lucius Verus, he is obliged to suppose^ that the author could not have seen the work of Ptolemy, who lived in the reign of Adrian. Now the reasons for establishing the priority of the Periplus are these ; first in going down the coast of Africa, the extent of discovery is Rhaptum, in latitude 9\u00b0 0' 0* south ; but in Ptolemy a farther progress is made to Prasum, in latitude 15\u00b00'0\u00bb south. This naturally appears a proof that Ptolemy is the later writer. But a stronger follows; the Peripl&s styles Ceylon, Palesimoondus, and adds, \" it is the \" same island as the ancients called Tapr6bana X\" But in the time of Ptolemy it had acquired a third name, Salik&, and he accordingly writes, \" Salike, which was formerly named Paie- :\u00b09 Page 35."], [82, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 54 *' simoondus.\" It follows then, that the author who writes Palesimoondus must be prior to the author who writes Salice. Dodwell, in order to obviate this self-evident truth, in the full spirit of system, is necessitated to argue, that the author of the Periplus, though an Alexandrian, had never seen the work of Ptolemy, who was of Alexandria also ; but that he copies Pliny, who was a Roman ; and then to support this strange hypothesis, he is compelled to maintain, that the Palesimoondus of Pliny is not Ceylon, or the Taprobana of the ancients, but the Hippo koora of Ptolemy in Ariake. or Concan. How these assertions could be deemed authentic by any one, when Dodwell wrote, is incomprehensible, unless we calculate the dignity which at taches to erudition. But we now know that Salike, is derived from Sala-bha\"\u00b0, the Sanskreet name of Ceylon, and Palesi moondus, from Parashri-mandala, the country of Parashri1\", or the Indian Bacchus. Both are native names, and voyagers at different times acquired both from the natives. When the island comes under consideration in the course of the narra tive, more will be said on this subject, at present this is ample proof, that the merchants in the age of the author called Ceylon Palesimoondus, and that in Ptolemy's age it was styled *Salik& ; if Ptolemy then allows the former to be first in use, the Periplus must of necessity be prior to his publication. Dodwell says \"\\ that none of Ptolemy's astronomical ob servations are earlier than the ninth year of Adrian, answering to 123, A. D. If then the first year of Marcus and Lucius Verus is l6l, A.

On this head probability and conjecture must supply the place of proof. The author speaks of the discovery of Hippalus, with out specifying its date, or its distance from his own time. Some considerable interval is manifest from his expression, when he says, \" from the time of Hippalus to this day some sail \" straight from Kane, &c. \"3,\" but what space to allot to this interval is by no means evident. Erom the seventh of Claudius, the assumed epoch of the discovery, to the ninth of Adrian\"4, is seventy-eight years, a space in which we may fix the publica tion of the Periplus, so as best to suit with other circumstances, and there is one reason to six it considerably previous to Pto lemy \"s, which is this ; Ptolemy professes to derive his informa tion from the merchants of Egypt, and the Periplus seems to be the very work he would have consulted, if he had known it ; and yet one circumstance is sufficient to prove, that it never came under his contemplation. His error of extending the coast of Malabar west and east, instead of north and south, is no torious ; this he could not have done if he had consulted the Periplus, for there it is laid down in its proper direction. This induces a belief, that it was not published in, or near the age of Ptolemy, but so much prior as to be neglected, or from its compass and contents not to have obtained much notice at the time of its publication.

But in order to see the state of things suitable to the internal evidence of the Periplus, we must take a view of the Roman government in Egypt. Egypt became a Roman province in the year thirty before our 6ra, and from the moment it was subdued, Augustus planned the extension of the Roman power into Arabia and Ethiopia, supposing that Arabia produced spices, and Ethiopia, gold, because these were the articles brought out of those countries into Egypt. The avidity with which this plan wras adopted may be conceived by observing that, within ten years after the reduction of Egypt, Gallus had penetrated into the heart of Arabia, and Petronius had ad vanced eight hundred and seventy miles above Syene into Ethiopia, and reduced Candakk the queen of that country to the condition of a tributary. The expedition of Petronius is fixed to a certainty in 21, A. C. because the ambassadors of Candake found Augustus at Samos, where he was that year ; and that of Gallus \"' was con temporary, because his absence with a part of the troops of the province was the inducement for Cand&k& \"' to insult the govern ment. It must also have been but a very few years after this, that Strabo went up to Syenb with Elius Gallus1'8, who was then become prefect. Upon this occasion he observes, that he was informed an hundred and twenty ships now sailed from Muos Hormus annually for India\"9, whereas, under the Pto- 116 Strabo, lib. xvii. p. 819. precisely Candake, though not Candace. 117 Bruce found a Hendaque still a sovereign \"8 Strabo, lib. ii. p. 118. in Ethiopia ; a proof that the name at least is \u25a0'\u00bb The expression is, /J^f* *% l\u00bbJuw, of that country and correct, for Hendaque is p. ioi ."], [85, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 57 lemies, a very few only had dared to undertake that voyage K-\u00b0. The embassies from Porus and Pandion to Augustus, men tioned with so much ostentation by the historians, afford con siderable proof of the progress of Roman discovery in the east ; and the vessels which conveyed these ambassadors from the coast of Malabar must have landed them either in Arabia, or in the Gulph of Persia, or in the Red Sea ; the conveyance also of the freedman of Plokamus back again from Ceylon to Egj-pt, proves that the voyage was performed previous to the discovery of Hippalus. Agreeably, therefore, to the assertion in the Periplils, we ought to suppose that none of these conveyances were effected by means of the monsoon, unless we should allow the vessels to be Indian or Arabian, for both these na tions appear visibly to have known the nature of these winds long before the Romans were acquainted with them. From these circumstances we may collect the extreme desire of Au gustus to extend his knowledge and his power towards the east, and though the inert reign of Tiberius, or the wild tyranny of Caligula, furnish no documents of a further progress, we may conclude, that the prefects of Egypt were -still intent on pro moting a discovery once commenced, and with which the emoluments of their own government were so immediately con nected. V.'e must suppose, that the Roman fleet was superior in the Red Sea and on the southern coast of Arabia, before any of the powers on that coast could become tributary, and teH butary they indubitably were before the reign of Claudius, or Plokamus could not have been farmer of the revenue. 1,0 'OXiym Tfairatretat.

The advantage which Claudius made of this discovery, and the prosecution of it so beneficial to Egypt, rendered his name dear to the Alexandrians ; his writings were rehearsed in their museum, and the account he gave of this commerce is justly believed by Dodwell to be the source of Pliny's informa tion1\". \u00bb It is this circumstance which above all others induces me to fix the destruction of Aden under Claudius, or at latest under Nero, whose mind was equally fixed on Ethiopia, Arabia, and India, as the fountains of all the treasures of the east.

One thing is evident, Aden was not destroyed by any Cesar in person ; sou we cannot find in all history a Cesar that ever visited the Southern coast of Arabia.

Adrian was in Egypt himself; his system was all directed to regulation and improvement of the provinces; this might be a part of his plan. But there is nothing in the Periplus itself to make us adopt this period, and every thing to contradict it. It has been necessary to investigate this fact with accuracy, because the date of the work depends upon it; for at whatever point we fix the destruction of Aden, very near to that we must fix the Periplfts ; as the author intimates that it was not long before the period in which he writes. It is not satisfactory to leave this question resting upon probabilities only. But where history is silent, probability is our only guide, and correspond ent circumstances are the best foundation on which probability can be built. From these premises the reign of Nero appears most ac cordant to the internal evidence of the work itself, or if the reign of Adrian should be preferred, it must be the year he was in Egypt, which is the tenth of his reign, and answers to the year 126 A.D. The objection to this is its coincidence with the age of Ptolemy, which for the reasons already specified can hardly be reconciled to consistence. I assume, therefore, the reign of Claudius for the discovery of Hippalus, and the tenth year of Nero for the date of the Periphis, leaving the question still open for the investigation of those who have better oppor tunities for deciding upon it with precision. i2"], [88, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS, 60 INTERCOURSE WITH INDIA ANTECEDENT TO HISTORY. X. In entering upon this subject two considerations present themselves to our view, which must be kept perfectly separate and distinct : the first is, that the intercourse itself is historical ; the second, that the means of intercourse can only be collected from circumstances : the former admits of proof; the latter is at best hypothetical. I can prove that spices were brought into Egypt, (which implies their introduction into all the countries on the Mediterranean,) and I argue from analogy, that Thebes and Memphis in their respective ages were the centre of this intercourse, as Alexandria was afterwards, and as Cairo is, in some degree, even at the present hour. That some Oriental spices came into Egypt has been fre quently asserted, from the nature of the aromatics which were employed in embalming the mummies\"3; and in the thirtieth chapter of Exodus we find an enumeration of cinnamon, kassia, myrrh, frankincense, stacte, onycha, and galbanum, which are all the produce either of India or Arabia. Moses speaks of these as precious, and appropriate to religious uses ; but at the same time in such quantities \"4, as to shew they were neither very rare, or very difficult to be obtained. Now it happens that cinnamon and kassia are two species of the same spice \"s, and that spice is not to be found nearer Egypt or Palestine, than Ceylon \"s, or the coast of Malabar. If then they were 143 Mummia, or Mumia, was once a medi- hundred of cassia, two hundred and fifty of cine,, certainly not on account of the cada- cinnamon. verous but the aromatic substance. ,as See article Kassia Kasia in the list of l'l Five hundred shekels of myrrh, five articles of commerce."], [89, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. \u00abr found in Egypt, they must have been imported ; there must have been intermediate carriers, and a communication of some kind or other, even in that age, must have been open between India and Egypt. That the Egyptians themselves might be ignorant of this, is possible ; for that the Greeks and Romans, as late as the time of Augustus\"8, thought cinnamon the pro duce of Arabia, is manifest from their writings. But it has been proved from Agatharchides, that the merchants of Sab\u00a3a traded to India, and that at the time when Egypt possessed the monopoly of this trade in regard to Europe ,2?, the Sabeans en joyed a similar advantage in regard to Egypt. Of these cir cumstances Europe was ignorant, or only imperfectly in formed ; and if such was the case in so late a period as a few years before the Christian era, the same circumstances may be supposed in any given age where it may be necessary to place them. There are but two possible means of conveying the com modities of India to the west, one by land through Persia or the provinces on the north, the other by sea ; and if by sea, Arabia must in all ages have been the medium through which this commerce passed, whether the Arabians went to Malabar itself, or obtained these articles in Karmania, or at the mouths of the Indus. In order to set this in its proper light, it is necessary to sup pose, that the spices in the most southern provinces of India were known in the most northern, and if from the north, they might pass by land ; from the south, they would certainly pass **?

But in no age were the Persians\"3, Indians\"9, or Egyptians, navigators; and if we ex clude these, we have no other choice but to fix upon the Arabians, as the only nation which could furnish mariners, carriers, or merchants in the Indian ocean. But let us trace the Communication by land on the north ; it is only in this one instance that I shall touch upon it; and that only because it relates to an account prior to Moses. Semi ramis'30 is said to have erected a column, on which the im7 mensity of her conquests was described, as extending from Ninus or Ninive, to the Itamenes, (Jomanes or Jumna,) east ward ; and southward, to the country which produced myrrh and frankincense ; that is, eastward to the interior of India, and southward to Arabia. Now, fabulous as this pillar may be, and fabulous as the whole history of Semiramis may be, there is still a degree of consistency in the fable ; for the tradi tion is general, that the Assyrians of Ninive did make an irrup tion into India; and the return of Semiramis131 through Ga- \"' It is not meant to assert that these nations never used the sea : they certainly did, upon their own coasts, but there are not now, nor does history prove that there ever were, any navigators, properly so called, in the eastern seas, except the Arabians, Malays, and Chinese. The Chinese usually came no farther than the coast of Malabar, the Malays seem in all ages to have traded with India, and probably with the coast of Africa. 131 When two fables of two different coun tries agree, there is always reason to suppose that they are founded on truth : the Maha bharat is perhaps as sabulous as the history of Semiramis ; but this work (in Col. Dow's account of it) specifies, upon a variety of occasions, the great attention of the Indian sovereigns to pay their tribute to their western conquerors. I cannot trace this to its causes or consequences, but it always seems to justify the idea, that there had been some conquest of India, by the nations which inhabited those provinces, which afterwards composed the Persian empire. It is this conquest in which the Grecian accounts of Semiramis and the Mahabharat agree. \"\u00bb In \u00abrbe Calechut qui Idola colunt (Gen. toos), non sulcant maria, id munus Mahume tanis delegatur.

If, therefore, there is any truth concealed under this history of Semiramis., the field is open for conceiving a constant intercourse esta blished between India and the Assyrian empire, and a ready communication between that empire and the countries border ing on the Mediterranean. This intercourse would account for the introduction of the gums, drugs, and spices of India into Egypt, as early as the c2lst century before the Christian era13% and 476' years antecedent to the age of Moses. But this is not the leading character in the accounts left us by the Greek historians'33; they all tend to Phenicia and Arabia. The Arabians have a sea coast round three sides of their vast peninsula; they had no prejudices against navigation either from habits or religion. There is no history which treats of them, which does not notice them as pirates or merchants by sea, as robbers or traders by land. We scarcely touch upon them accidentally in any author, without finding that they were the carriers of the Indian ocean. Sabea, Hadramaut'3*, and Oman were the residence of navi gators in all ages, from the time that history begins to speak of them ; and there is every reason to imagine that they were equally so, before the historians acquired a knowledge of them,. as they have since continued down to the present age. 134 Hadramaut is the Atrom'tis of the Greeks 3 it is nearly centrical between Sabea and Oman on the ocean. Oman is the eastern part of Arabia, towards the Gulph of Persia. Sabea is Yemen, on the Red Sea, but extends; or did anciently extend, to the ports on the ocean, as Aden, &c. 132 Semiramis, A,.C. 2007. Muses in Midian 1531.

See also p. 2.52,"], [92, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 64 It is surely not too much to admit that a nation with these dispositions, in the very earliest ages crossed the Gulph of Persia from Oman to Karmania : the transit in some places is not forty miles ; the opposite coast is visible from their own shore 13; : and if you once land them in Karmania, you open a passage to the Indus, and to the western coast of India, as a conclusion which follows of course.

I conclude that their knowledge in this respect is prior to the building of Thebes; and that if the monopoly on the eastern side of the Red Sea was in their hands, that on the western side was fixed at Thebes. The splendour of that city, still visible in its very ruins, is no other way to be accounted for : it is exactly parallel to the case of Alexandria in a later period ; for Alexandria did not trade to India, the monopoly was still in Sabea when Agatharchides wrote, and the monopoly at Alex- andria was as perfect in regard to the Mediterranean, as that of Sabea was in regard to the Indian ocean.

That the Grecian Dynasty in Egypt tried every experiment to evade the monopoly at Sab\u00a3a, is manifest from history. The straits I}1 of the Red Sea were passed, the ports of Arabia on the ocean were explored, the marts on the coasts of Africa were visited, Indian commodities were found in all of them. A proof direct, that the monsoon was at that time known to the Arabians ,3', though history knew nothing of it till the discovery of Hippalus ; that is, till 200 years later : this is the more ex traordinary, as the fact had been ascertained in part by the voyage of Nearchus, and as all its consequences would have been explored, if Alexander had lived another year. I wish to be understood as never asserting that the voyage be tween Egypt and India was utterly unpractised by the Greeks ; the evidence is clear, that some few vessels performed it, but they coasted the whole way ,3' : the greatest number is that mentioned by Strabo of an hundred and twenty ships. The expence of such a navigation did not answer; it was found 136 Euergetes says, in the Adulitick In scription, he had reduced the whole world to peace.

In what way they sailed previous to the Periplus will be noticed in its proper place. 138 I had expected to find an account of the monsoons in the Oriental writers ; but as my acquaintance with them by translations only, must be very confined, I have met with little information on the subject.

I believe that fact, not as performed by lambulus, but as an evidence that some such passage had been heard of, that an obscure notion prevailed that it was made from the coast of Africa, and that, therefore, it was interwoven with the piece to give the fable an appearance of reality. I believe it to have had its rise from Arabia; and it is one proof among others, that the Arabians did reach India prior to history, and a sufficient reason why the Greeks found it preferable to purchase their cargoes in the Arabian markets, rather than to go to India themselves. A truth certainly, if the Arabians sailed with the monsoon, and the Greeks coasted the whole voyage. These considerations taken in the mass, induce a belief that in the very earliest ages, even prior to Moses, the communi cation with India was open, that the intercourse with that con tinent was in the hands of the Arabians, that Thebes had owed its splendour to that commerce, and that Memphis rose from the same cause to the same pre-eminence. Sir Isaac Newton supposes Osiris, Bacchus, Sesostris, and Sesak, to be one and the same person. If this could be established, we could fix the splendour of Thebes in the reign of Sesak, who is contem porary with Rehoboam, in the year 97S before Christ. Thebes is the No-Amon of Jeremiah, xlvi. 25. and Ezekiel, xxx. 14, 15, 16. The fall of Thebes was effected by Nebuchadnezzar, in 581 A. C, for he is said to have conquered Egypt from Migdol to Seoene, that is, from Magdulum to Sy\u00a3ne, which necessarily includes Thebes, (Septuagint and Prideaux ;) but"], [95, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 67 its ruin was completed by Cambyses. Psammenitus, indeed, the last king, was taken at Memphis, and not at Thebes, 528 A. C. but Camby'ses passed through all Egypt, and entered Ethiopia; and in this march he must have visited Thebes, and probably destroyed the temples there. Memphis is the Mesr of Scripture, from Misraim : it possibly rose into importance after the invasion of Nebuchadnezzar, but existed from a much earlier period, though not as a capital ; for the ancient metro polis of Lower Egypt was Heliopolis, the On of Scripture, now called Matarea, in its ruins ; and Heli6polis is at least as old as the patriarchs, apparently the residence of the Pharaohs, and the head of that kingdom which was governed b}- Joseph. The sovereignty was afterwards transferred to Memphis, built by Menes, who reigned as immediate successor to the gods, or by the succeeding sovereign Amenophis, from whom1 its name is derived ; the Menuph, Noph, or Moph of the prophets. (See Sir Isaac Newton's Chronology, p. 197.) The seat of government, under the Persians, was at Memphis ; at Alex andria, under the Macedonians and Romans ; and Cairo, still called Mesr or Metzr by the Arabians, was the creation of the Mahomedans. This slight sketch gives us all the fluctuations of power, and all the different seats of commerce in Egypt, ex clusive of the fabulous chronology and fictitious history of the priests, during the period previous to Sesak. The system of Sir Isaac Newton has not been generally admitted ; but from Sesak, in 978 before our era, the whole arrangement is consistent ; and that Sesak was the Sesostris of Herodotus seems highly probable : his conquests in Phenicia, Syria, and Pales tine, are enumerated among his other expeditions by Herodo tus ; and his passing the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb into the k 2"], [96, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 68 Erythrean ocean is suitable to his ambition. That his successes and victories were magnified by, the priests of Egypt there can be no doubt ; but that commerce was his object, as well as do minion, is manifest from his establishing a fleet on the Red Sea, and passing the straits : both which prove that his views were directed either to Arabia, or Africa, or the countries farther to she east. The produce of those countries came into his own territories by some conveyance or other ; and his design was to obtain this in its native ports, in conformity with the attempts of the Greeks^and Romans in a later period. The essential differ ence between the native capitals and Alexandria proves, past con tradiction, the different spirit and superior system of the Greeks. For these-eapitals were inland for the sake of security : a proof that the natives were rarely navigators, and never sovereigns of the sea. The Greeks were both; and the capital of the Ptolemies was therefore Alexandria. Their fleets were superior to all that had ever appeared on the Mediterranean; and the power of their kingdom such, that nothing but a succession of weak and wicked princes could have destroyed it. While Egypt was under the power of its native sovereigns, Tyre, Sidon, A'radus, Cyprus, Greece, Sicily, and Carthage, were all enriched by the trade carried on in its ports, and the articles of commerce which could be obtained there and there only; the Egyptians themselves were hardly known in the Mediterranean as the ex porters of their own commodities , they were the Chinese of the ancient world, and the ships of all nations X except their own, laded in their harbours. u\u00b0 *a^ifc-txo\u00ab .... n-a^'.x\"!)

Alex- andria grew up to be the first mart of the world, and the Greeks of Egypt were the carriers of the Mediterranean, as well as the agents, factors, and importers of Oriental produce. The cities which had risen under the former system, sunk silently into in- significance ; and so wise was the new policy, and so deep had it taken root, that the Romans, upon the subjection of Egypt, found it more expedient to leave Alexandria in possession of its privileges, than to alter the course of trade, or occupy it them- selves. Egypt, in strict propriety, was never a Roman pro- vince, but a prefecture, governed, not by the senate, but the emperor himself. No pretor or proconsul ever had the command ; no man above the equestrian order was ever prefect ; no Roman '*' ever entered the country without the express licence of the emperor.

The revenue is still large, but nothing in comparison of what it would be, if the merchant were secure from exactions, or the cultivator from op pression ; for a great proportion of the Indian trade would still come through Egypt to the Mediterranean, if the customs were fixed, the trade protected from the plunder of the Arabs, the rapine of the government, and the extortion of the Jews, who are the farmers of the revenue. The total, with all this op pression, is still estimat' d at twenty millions of dollars, or four which is the end of all government. When Egypt fell, its prosperity, though impaired, was probably superior to that of any other pro vince of the empire. The revenue I take at a med'um from the calculation of Strabo, who says, that under Ai.letes, the worst of the Ptolemies, it was 2,421.875/.; but he atds, that the Romans managed it to much greater advantage, and even doubled it.

Muos Hormus lies in the twenty-seventh degree of northern latitude, and Rhaptum will be fixed near ten degrees to the southward of the equator; consequently we have a space of above two thousand five hundred miles to examine, involved in such obscurity, that without recourse to modern discovery, the navigation of the ancients is inexplicable. The Periplus, which has been assumed as the basis of our dis quisition, has a claim to this preference, not only as the most ancient but the most specific account extant ; for notwith standing particular places may have been noticed in treatises of a prior date, the line of coast which it embraces is to be found no where previously in detail ; and the circumstances which it particularizes bear such a stamp of veracity, as to assure us, that if the voyage was not performed by the writer, it is at least delineated from the most authentic documents of the ace. Ptolemy writes both Rhapta and Rhaptum, the Periplus always Rhapta, plural."], [105, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN. 75 But the internal evidence of the work itself is sufficient to assure us, that the author was a merchant, and the merchant a navigator. He writes for the information of persons of his own profession; and as he supposes the Gulph of Arabia fa miliar to all that were engaged in commerce at Alexandria, he Oct- 7 dwells much more particularly on the more distant regions than those nearer home. This is the reason that within the gulph there is no circumstantial account, till we arrive at Adooli on the western side, or Moosa on the eastern ; and that when he launches into the ocean, we have the coast of Azania and India in detail. Another cause which operates to the same effect is the nature of the navigation within the gulph ; for he expressly mentions, that in his time the voyage from Berenike. to Okelis, and from Leake Kome to Moosa, was direct down the mid channel, without regard to the coast. The same we may presume of the passage from Muos Hormus to Adooli, as he mentions only two intermediate ports, Berenike and Ptolemais Theron, and these with few particulars, on a coast nine hundred miles in extent. This is in one sense to be regretted, for had the merchant proceeded on this coast, as Nearchus traced the desert shores of the Mekran, we should have had the opportunity of compar ing his progress with that of John de Castro2 in 1541, and - John de Castro was captain in the fleet, commanded by Don Stephano de Gama, sent from Goa to burn the Turkish navy collecting at Suez, for the siege of Diu. In the passage up the Red Sea, he seems to have had the whole care of conducting the fleet ; but when they arrived at Suez with sixteen gallies only, they found the attempt on the Turkish forces impracticable. The journal of de Castro was found on board a Portuguese prize, and brought to England ; when a translation of it was procured by Sir Walter Raleigh, which is inserted in Purchas, vol. ii. p. 1122. and pub lished again in Astley's Collection, vol. i. p. 107. where there is an excellent commentary on it by Green. De Castro was afterwards viceroy of Goa, when he raised the second siege of Diu with great glory. He died not L 2"], [106, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN. 76 establishing all the points of ancient geography in a tract that is remarkably obscure. The course of de Castro is an exact counterpart to the voyage of Nearchus : he set out from Masua [Adooli] with a fleet ; but the larger ships he soon dismissed, and proceeded with sixteen gallies only along the whole western coast of the gulph to Suez. This voyage he performed by ad hering constantly to the shore, rowing for the most part, and sailing only with accidental snatches of the land winds, anchor ing almost every night, and particularizing every cape, bay, port, or shoal in his passage : in short, if we had found a de Castro on the coast of Gadrosia, or a Nearchus in the gulph of Arabia, it would have afforded one of the most pleasing spe culations of geography to compare an ancient with a modern voyage, where both were conducted upon the same principles, and by the same means; excepting only the advantages which the moderns derived from their instruments and their ex- perience. Some particulars which concern this navigation generally will not be foreign to our purpose ; for we learn from de Castro's journal, that the wind in the gulph, which is almost constantly north-west, except during fifty days in March and April, does not prevail regulars, but is subject to fluctuation 3 near the coast; it is not represented as the land and sea breeze, which takes place within the region of the monsoons, but merely as a deviation from the prevailing wind of the gulph.

Another circumstance he notices, that docs not do much honour to the attention or sagacity of the Ptolemies, which is, that the number of safe harbours, creeks, bays, and inlets is infinite, whereas Berenike and Ptolemais Theron were merely roads, where the ships anchored, and made use of boats for their communication with the shore. The shoals in Foul Bay, in which Berenike is situated, and those near Ras Ahehaz in the vicinity of Ptolemais Theron, he describes most graphically, in correspondence with Agatharchides and the Periplus, and is in full harmony with Bruce, who notices all the shoals with deep water on their edge, and the same in every harbour on the coast without bar or obstruction. These circumstances, relating generally to the navigation upon which we are now to enter, will not appear superfluous, if they contribute to illustrate a most obscure subject ; and I am only sorry that the Periplus affords such slender opportunity of turning them to advantage ; for the journal of de Castro is one of the finest specimens bequeathed to us by the illustrious navi gators'of Portugal, and continues to this day the best foundation of geographical accuracy on the western coast of the Arabian gulph. * This passage is marked on Bruce's map."], [108, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 78 Muos Hormus I. The survey now commences from Muos Hormus s, a port chosen by Ptolemy Philadelphus for the convenience of com merce, in preference to Atslnofe or Suez, on account of the difficulty of navigating the western extremity of the gulph. The name of this port shews its origin to be Greek ; it sig nifies the harbour of the Mouse6; an appellation which it after wards changed for that of the harbour of Venus. And here, if the reader will advert to Aphrodite, the Greek title of Venus, as springing from the foam of the ocean, it will immediately appear that the Greeks were translators in this instance, as well as in Diospolis, Latopolis, and many others ; for the native term to this day is Suffange-el-Bahri 7, the sponge of the sea ; and the vulgar error of sponge being the foam of the sea will immediately account for Aphrodite. But Muos Hormus is the name more prevalent, and the other is recorded by Agathar chides only and his copyists.

Strabo describes the entrance as oblique10, which was perhaps effected by the site of the island at the entrance ; and he notices that the ships which sailed from Berenike lay at this port till their cargoes weFe prepared. II. The same reason which induced Philadelphus to form the port of Muos Hormus, led him afterwards to the establishment of Berenike, with this additional motive; that being in a lower part of the gulph, it facilitated the communication with the ocean, or the coast of Africa, and lay more convenient for tak ing advantage of the regular winds within the straits, or the monsoons in the Indian ocean. The plans of Philadelphus, indeed, seem to have been larger than either he or his succes sors carried into execution : he had evidently sent travellers to penetrate into the interior by land, while his fleet was explor ing the coast. Pliny mentions the names of Dahon, Aristocreon, Bion, and Bdsilis11, as visitors of Ethiopia; and Simonides as residing five years at Meroe; while Timosthenes\" went down the coast as far, perhaps, as Madagascar, but certainly lower than the fleets of the Ptolemies traded I3, or the Roman fleets 5 n^oKEio-Sai Je viio-a? 7_~k.

The account of Agatharchides, who lived in the reign of Philometor, goes no lower on the western side of the gulph than Ptolemais Theron; and in his time the commerce seems so generally to have settled at Muos Hormus, that no mention of Berenikfe occurs in the whole work1*. Un der the successors of Philometor, this trade languished rather than increased, nor was it reinvigorated till the conquest of Egypt by Augustus. The connexion between Muos Hormus and Berenike, from which ports the navigation commenced, requires more con sideration than has been bestowed upon it by those who have preceded me in the inquir}'. Berenike, according to the Periplus, was distant eighteen hundred stadia from Muos Hormus, which, if the author reckons ten stadia to the Roman mile, (as d'Anville supposes,) amounts to one hundred and eighty ; or if he reckons eight, we obtain two hundred and twenty-five miles, for the interval be tween the two ports ; both estimates are too short, as the dis tance from the northern Jaffateen to Ras-el-anf 's is little less than two hundred and sixty miles Roman. Without insisting upon this, Ras-el-anf is the leading point to fix Berenike, for this is the Lepte Promontory of Ptolemy, on which Berenike depends. \" The land here,\" says Bruce, \" after running in a \" direction nearly N.

It may seem extraordinary l6, that the name of Foul Bay \" should appear upon our modern charts in this very spot, and marked with the shoals and breakers which entitled it to the same appellation in the time of Strabo. But such is the fact, and de la Rochette's chart ,8 gives us a small anchorage or inlet in the very bottom of the bay, which he styles Mine, or Belled-el-Ilabesh\", the country of Abyssinia. These circumstances are further corro borated by the chart which Mercator extracts from Ptolemj', and by Ptolemy's own distances in longitude and latitude from Lepte. Col. Capper\u2122 has supposed that the site of Berenike cannot be determined, and d'Anville has placed it nearer to Lepte ; but in this, it is probable he was determined by the latitude of Syene, for both are supposed to be tropical, and Col. Capper has possibly not applied his superior information to this object. I fix it at the port of Habesh, not from lati tude, but local relation. For Sy&ne is in latitude 24\u00b0 0' 45\", and this port is in 23\u00b0 2S' 0\", according to de la Rochette.

But the ancients were by no means accurate in these coincidences.

I am much more led by existing circumstances than these estimates : a coast falling in, as described by the original voyagers, and a port found at the termination where it ought to be, tend more to ascertain a position when ancient accounts are to be considered, than astronomical calculation.

And in their voyage to India, sailing in July, if they cleared the gulph be fore the 1st of September23, they had the monsoon for nearly '\" There was a Sapphire, an Emerald, and a Topaz island in the Red Sea ; all three give rise to much fable and much uncertainty.

III. But before we enter upon our navigation we must ex amine the previous preparations in Egypt, commencing our inquiries from Alexandria, the head and centre of all the com merce between India and Europe for seventeen centuries14. The principal merchants, who carried on this commerce both under the Ptolemies and the Romans, resided at Alexandria ; and though the Ptolemies, for their own interest, might allow others to employ their capital in this trade, and the Romans certainly would not suffer themselves to be wholly excluded, still the standing law of the country was, that every merchant must employ an Alexandrian factor for the transaction of his busi ness ; and this privilege alone, with the profits of the transport, is sufficient to account for the immense wealth of the metro polis l\\ exclusive of all other advantages. In the latter end of July the annual or Etesian wind com mences, the influence of which extends from the Euxine Sea to Syene in Upper Egypt. Blowing from the north it is directly opposite to the course of the Nile, and prevailing for forty days while the river is at the height of its swell, it affords an oppor tunity of advancing against the stream, with more convenience than other rivers are navigated in their descent. With the as sistance of this wind, the passage from Alexandria up to Koptus was performed in twelve days, which, as the distance is above Star, July 26, and reached Okelis in thirty Alexander. days, from whence to Muziris the voyage is \" The revenue of Alexandria, in the usually performed in forty days.

Two miles from Alexandria, says Pliny, is Juliopolis, where the navigation to Koptus commences ; an expression not very intelligible without the assistance of Strabo. For. why should he mark the departure from Juliopolis rather than Alexandria ? Strabo informs us, that the vessels navigated a canal, which ex tended from Alexandria to the Kan6pic branch of the Nile, at the junction of which was Schedia; here all the duties were collected on goods which passed upwards into Egypt, or down the Nile to Alexandria. This canal \" in its course almost touches Nik6polis zS, (a city so called from the victory obtained here by Augustus over the forces of Antony,) and which, by its distance of thirty stadia I9, must be the Juliopolis of Pliny. It is probable, therefore, that before the time of Pliny, the Cus tom-house had been removed from Schedia to this place. _ It is then by the Kanopic branch, now almost neglected, that vessels passed up to Memphis, and thence to Koptus.

Upon reference to the map the reason of this is evident. The river bends here towards the east, and in proportion to its inclination shortens the distance of land carriage. Koptus is seated al most in the centre between Ghinne and Kous 3I. Ghinne is the ancient Ken&3\\ and is the modern point of communication with Coseir33; the port on the Red Sea, where the commerce which remains is carried on between Upper Egypt and Arabia. Kous arose in the middle ages from the same cause, and be came the principal mart of the Said34. These three places all lie on the same curvature of the river, and all grew into im portance at different periods, from the same cause ; the neces sity of conducting land carriage by the shortest road. It has been already noticed, that notwithstanding Berenike was built by Philadelphus, the route of the caravan thither, and the port itself were little frequented, as long as the Ptolemies reigned in Egypt. The first mention I can find of it is in Strabo, and he visited the country after it was under the power of the Romans. The Romans saw what Philadelphus had designed, and they bad the penetration, from their first entrance into the country, to reap the advantages which his successors had ne glected.

The bulk of the trade still passed by Koptus36 to Muos Hormus, and continued in the same course till the period in which the Periplus was written ; this is the principal reason which induces me to believe that the Periplus is prior to Pliny, and assign it to the reign of Claudius, or Nero ; for Pliny is the first that specifies the stages of the caravan, or gives us reason to believe that Berenike was the o-rand centre of commerce. That it was not so when the author of the Periplus wrote is evident, because he commences his route from Muos Hormus3', a proof that he considered it as the first port of departure. 35 It has everywhere been supposed, that single ships did sail both to India and Africa by coasting, previous to the discovery of Hip palus ; it has everywhere been allowed that the Arabians traded to India, and the Indians to Arabia, and probably with a knowledge of the monsoon. But this passage of Strabo's stands alone as an evidence, that a fleet sailed from Egypt directly to India. If it did sail, it must still have coasted the whole way. . But might not Strabo, from knowing they brought home Indian commodities, have sup posed that they sailed to India, when in reality they went no farther than Hadramaut in Arabia, or Mosyllon on the coast of Africa ; where they found the produce of India ? \u2014 I do not approve of contradicting the assertion of any intelligent author, 6uch as Strabo ; but I recommend it to the consideration of better judges, whether a circumstance of this magni tude ought to be established on a single passage. It is also to be noticed, that Arabia was some times called India by the ancients, not from error, but because it was on the other side of the Red Sea, and because the commodities of India were found there.

These transactions Strabo relates as an eye-witness, for he accompanied Elius Gallus to Syene. And in the interval between the conquest of Egypt and the reign of Claudius, a period of 71 years, there is every reason to suppose, that a province so productive, and a commerce so advantageous, had never been neglected. But it was not till the discovery of the monsoon, which we place in his reign, that all the advantages of Berenike would become obvious. \"Phis would by degrees draw the concourse from Muos Hormus ; it had not operated essentially in the age of Strabo ; the change was beginning to be felt when the Periplus was written ; it was fully effected in the time of Pliny.

They are inclosed by more inland tribes, who are distinguished as Akridophagi48 aud Moskhophagi, titles which imply that their food is locusts and veal.

The distances are, four thousand stadia from Berenikfc to Ptolemais, and three thousand from Ptolem&is to Adooli. It is this deficiency which has induced Mr. Gossellin54 to carry the Adooli of the Periplus to Assab, or Saba, con trary to the opinion of all former geographers, and contrary to the local circumstances of Adooli, so strongly marked by our author. The removal of Adooli from Masua to Saba, and of Ptolemais from Ras Ahehas in 18\u00b0 31' 0\" to 16\u00b0 58' 0\", are therefore mu tually connected in Mr. Gossellin's system; and as this brings Ptolemais within thirty-two minutes of the parallel of Meroe, the whole would be reconcileable if we could make the mea~ sures of the Periplus accord ; but this is impossible55 ; and here M It was at the moment that this sheet was article of Ptolemais in order to advert to the points returned from the press' for correction, that I re- on which we differ.

This is a serious mistake ; for the Periplils marks the termination of these stadia at a very deep bay where the Opsian stone is found5*, and from that bay mentions expressly the- commence ment of the inclination which the coast takes to the east \", and which it continues till it joins the straits : all this is true, if Adooli is fixed at Masua, and false, if it is carried to Saba, or Assab. The Periplils, therefore, is consistent in its descrip tion, and inconsistent in its measures; and to which of the two the preference ought to be given, will hardly be disputed by those who know the little certainty of all numbers in a Greek manuscript, and how much all printed texts are corrected by circumstances before they can be made consistent. The real position, therefore, of Ptolemais Th6rdn cannot be determined from these data ; but if we relinquish the measures of the Periplus, and search for it by the parallel of Meroe, we meet with many curious particulars to compensate for the digression, and furnish means for the reader to determine for himself. Meroe, as the first parallel of Eratosthenes, became an ob ject of the greatest importance to all the geographers and astro nomers wdio succeeded ; and if there is any one point more than another upon which we can suppose them to have searched for accuracy or acquired it, it is this.

Now in this passage there are two errors ; for first, forty-five degrees are not the same as forty-five days, as there are three hundred and sixty-five days in a year, instead of three hundred and sixty, which there ought to be, to make the two agree ; and secondly, the place of the sun is mistated, both upon his approach and his return, for by a calculation of Mr. Wales's, with which he favoured me a few days before his death, it appears, through i6\u00b0 25' o\".

But we have another coincidence between the measures of Pliny and the observations, which is equally remarkable; for Pliny has preserved the report of two Roman centurions sent into Ethiopia by Nero, who reckoned eight63 hundred and seventy-three miles from Syene to the confluence of the Nile with the Astaboras, and seventy from the confluence to Meroe 6\\ 61 \"Ei Jii ti; Iif Tfitixoo-ti* \\%r,x<ma. 7fj.ifi.ttTa te^io\u00bb tov juELyij-ov Tns yw; xvxXov, trat liT7a.xoa-iuii ro-^iwv 'ixae-rot t2\u00bb 7fj.-nfjca.7uv.

Bruce had good instruments, and had been long practised in observation ; but he was struggling for his life, and his observations must have been hasty : still as we have no better, and no traveller is soon likely to correct his errors if he is mistaken, we are entitled to use his statement till a better can be obtained.

He likewise found an island in the Nile called Kurgos by the natives : and such an island, which served for a port to Meroe, Pliny mentions by the name of Tadu 6?. These circumstances are so connected, that if it were not carrying the latitude too far north, we might prefer his con jecture to his position of Meroe. There is yet another fact still more appropriate ; for if his observations are accurate, and he has placed the confluence of the two rivers exact, the distance from the confluence to Gibbainy measures upon his map as precisely fifty minutes as possible; an approach so near to the seventy Roman miles of Pliny68, that no greater accuracy can be required. It is true that this correspondence will depend on the correctness of Bruce's observations ; but if they are faulty, who shall be the traveller to correct them ? It is true also, that dake's eunuch was baptized by Philip. Bruce found the name of Hendaque still existing. III. Toto tractu sacella. In Abyssinia the churches stood so thick, that the service could be heard from one to the other, as is noticed by the Jesuits and confirmed by Bruce. In these respects, therefore, the manners of all these na tions appear similar. Pliny notices, in another passage, that they had forty-five kings ; a strong characteristick of Abyssinia, perhaps, rather than Meroe. The temple of Hammon, Strabo informs us, had been neglected by the Romans, and the superstition despised. In his age, therefore, the O'asis itself of Hammon had fallen to decay. It might still, however, preserve its reputation among the Meroites. See Strabo, lib. xv. p. 815.

And now, if it should ever be the lot of a future traveller to tread this arid soil again, at this point his search for Meroe should commence ; and if no ruins were found farther to the south, he might greet Bruce as the discoverer of Merok; an honour which, perhaps, would be less disputed than his pre- tensions to the first discovery of the sources of the Nile.. We ought not to be ungrateful to those who explore the desert for our information : Bruce may have offended from the warmth of his temper, he may, have been misled by aspiring to knowledge and to science which he had not sufficiently examined; but his work throughout bears the internal evidence of veracity, in all instances where he was not deceived himself. His instruments were good, and so far his observations deserve respect ; but they were made by a man in the moment when he was struggling for his life ; still if we should be disposed to adopt his conjecture, rather than his position, from the circumstances before us, the extreme difference between him and the ancient astronomers is, as 16\u00b0 24' 0\" to 17\u00b0 4' 0\", a disagreement, per haps, less allowable in this instance than most others, but still excusable, from the imperfection of all ancient observations de pending on the shadow of the Gnomon, and the length of the day, and those of Ptolemy more especially. If by stating these particulars relative to the latitude of Meroe, we could have obtained the position of Ptolemais, we should not have to ask the reader's pardon for the digression; but all that we pretend to deduce from it, is, that Ptolemais"], [134, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 102 cannot be fixed at Ras Ahehaz, or Ageeg, where it is placed by d'Anville and Bruce. The Shumeta, or Nubian Forest, which was the resort of the elephants, when Ptolemy built the city, and continues so to the present hour, is supposed to commence in the neighbourhood of that Cape, in latitude 18\u00b0 31' 0\", which disagrees more than twro degrees with Ptolemy, and nearly one and an half with the conjecture of Bruce. If we descend the coast a degree and a half, we arrive at a bay in the middle of the Nubian forest, the lower point of which is nearly in latitude 17\u00b0 6' 0\" ; a correspondence with Bruce's conjectural parallel of Meroe, so near as to be satisfactory. On a projecting point of this sort Ptolemais was built by Eumedes69, and secured from the natives by a foss carried round the angle from sea to sea ; and if this situation should appear reasonable, from the deduc tions we have been so desirous to state, a better spot for pro curing elephants cannot be chosen. There is not a wish to conceal the uncertainty of this con clusion : the coast is little visjted by any European vessels, and the charts of our best Hydrographers are therefore less to be depended on : Strabo's account agrees better with the measures of the Periplus, and the assumption of d'Anville at Ras Ahehaz. If the distance in the Periplus from thence to Adooli had been equally consistent, it would have been conclusive ; but the whole is now determined by the parallel of Meroe, which the ancients carry through Ptolemais, and we cannot well attribute to them an error of two degrees, on a point better established than almost any other whatsoever. Mr. Gossellin carries it still lower, but without a cape, or any circumstance to mark the spot. And it is to be remarked, that f3 Strabo, fib. xvi. p. 770."], [135, "PTOLEMAIS. 103 he is so attached to his own estimates, for correcting the lati tudes of Ptolemy and the other ancient geographers, that he pays little respect to local circumstances and the characteristick features of the coast. As 1 cannot dispute this matter on every point where we differ, I shall observe here, that his want of at tention to the text appears no where more conspicuous than at Adooli, which the Periplils marks with distinctions that cannot be mistaken, and which Mr. Gossellin transforms or displaces with great violence. The consequence is, that he is obliged to have two Adoolis, for which there can be no warrant either in history or geography. With whatever errors my arrangement of the coast may be chargeable, I trust it will only affect individual positions: the general outline I am persuaded is true. I submit it, indeed, with less confidence to the public since I have perused the Researches of Mr. Gossellin. But I shall not relinquish the ground I have taken in a single instance. I trust to the in vestigation which I have patiently pursued under every dif ficulty, and I leave the issue to the judgment of those who are competent to decide. It is necessary now to observe, that the hunting of elephants established at Ptolemais is confirmed by Agatharchides, Dio dorus, Strabo, and other authors. The manner of hamstring ing these animals was an art as perfectly understood by the ancient barbarians70, as by Bruce's Agageers; and the relish71 for the flesh of the elephant is an indelible characteristick of the nation. Ptolemy would have redeemed the life of the 70 See Strabo, lib. xvi. p. 772. Diodor. the sun. \u2014 They cut it from the living animal, lib. iii. p. 161. according to Agatharchides and Strabo.

ADOOLI. V. Fkom Ptolemais, the next port we are conducted to by the Periplus is Adooli, at the distance of about three thousand stadia; a space by no means agreeable to the difference be tween Ras Ageeg and this place 7!, as little more than two degrees of latitude intervene, which produce short of an hun dred and forty miles, where we ought to find three hundred. This we are informed was a regular and established port 7*, and it can be no other than the celebrated harbour and bay of Masuah, so well known by the accounts of the Jesuits and of Bruce, as the only proper entrance into Abyssinia. It is not my intention to enter farther into the detail of this country, so extraordinary and now so well known, than lam led by the classical authorities before me; but they are so numerous, and so consistent with modern accounts, that to neglect them altogether would be reprehensible. In coming from the north, the bay of Adooli or Masuah stretches far to the south 7S, and Adooli lies in the interior part \" See Agatharchides, p. 14. Hudson, Geog. Min. towards the right.

On this account the merchants had afterwards preferred the anchorage at another island, called Orine, or the Rock, at twenty 's miles distance from the coast79, which answers to the Dahalac of Bruce, or one of its dependencies a\u00b0. The two islands in the bay are called Sheik Sede and Toualhout, and for the former, which is a title manifestly derived from a Sheik's tomb, De la Rochette has found the name of Duli 8l, still bear ing a resemblance to the ancient Adooli. \"6 De Castro in Purchas, ii. 1126. describes this port, with the channel, a faucon shot ; in some parts not so much, with cisterns, and Arkeeko a league distant. trade.

Bruce, iii. p. 56. 78 When de Castro was at Masuah in 1541, the Sheik of Dahalac was master of Masuah. His residence was generally at Dahalak, and he came only occasionally to Masuah. In fixing upon Dahalac for Orine, I am guided by the two hundred stadia of the Peri plus, and supported by d'Anville. But Orir.c signifies mountainous rather than rocky. Cos mas indeed says, that Orine is L-kq uiXtuii Jso, but two miles distant ; in this, however, he must be mistaken, or have confounded it with Sede or Toualhout, for the mention of the islands Alalaiou in the Periplus, evidently the dependencies of Dahalac, if not Dahalac itself, leaves little doubt on the allotment of Orine.

The province assigned to this sovereign corresponds precisely with the territory assigned to the Bahr-nagash, or king of the coast, under the empire of Abyssinia ; and the manners attri buted to him are consistent with that pre-eminence which the Abyssinians in all ages seem to have preserved over the bar barous tribes by which they are surrounded. How it has happened that a nation neither Nigritian or Ethiopick S9 should be settled in this part of Africa, distinguished from all around them, as much formerly by their manners, as they now are by their religion, is a problem that has divided the opinion of all who have visited the country.

A question well worthy of examination by those who are qualified to decide. But as far as a private judgment is of weight, I must confess, that the account of Herodotus has always appeared to me the most rational ; that they are a nation of fugitives from Egypt. Strabo, in copying this opinion, has added, that the appellation91 they give them selves is Sebrit\u00e6 93 ; a term which signifies Adven\u0153\"*, the more remarkable, as Bruce observes, that the original title by which they are distinguished in their own history and language, is that of Habesh95, or Conven\u00e6. It is impossible to suppose, that the affinity of these two words is accidental. The flight of these exiles is fixed by Herodotus in the reign of Psammetichus96, 630 years before Christ, and only 185 91 A speculation well worthy the investiga tion of Lieut. Wilford, and coinciding with his svstem. among much obscurity, much truth may be discovered. And where I should think that Sukho is Suakem, but that Strabo says it is inland. It is in reality a town on an island in a bay, the approach to which is by a narrow channel like a river. Seede la Rochette's map of the Red Sea. See also the learned Lar cher's notes eighty and eighty-three, on this passage of Herodotus, with his citations from Plutarch de Exilio, p. 601, and from Dio dorus, lib. i. p. 77. 92 I think I can fix the site of the Sebrit\u00e6 so positively as to identify them with the Abyssinians ; the place assigned to them by Strabo is Tenesis, inland from Sabai ; and Sabai is both by d'Anville and Bruce supposed to be Ras Assab, that is, Cape Assab, in lat. 13\u00b0 3'. Cape Assab assumes the same form as C. Asabo, or Mocandon, and both signify the southern cape. Mocandon is the sauth point in the gulph of Persia, and C. Assab o. in respect to Egypt. If this be allowed, it accords intimately with Abyssinia ; because as Strabo goes inland he reverts to Meroe, \\Vhich proves that his detail on the coast, and in the inteiior, do not quite keep pace together. A line drawn from Assab to Meroe would almost; touch Axuma, and cut Abyssinia in the centre. I wish a reference to be made to the whole passage in Strabo, lib. xvi. p. 77c. where 93 He adds, that these Sebrit\u00e6 are under the government of the queen of Meroe, p. 771. which, though perhaps not true, discovers the connexion, or the similarity of government. 94 Ptolemy has the name of Sibridse, per haps the same, in the Greek text Sebard\u00e6. 93 Bruce, vol. i. p. 379. 96 Psammetichus died in 616.

In addition to this testimony of Herodotus, we have a variety of evidence from other authors, that Adooli101 was built by exiles from Egypt ; and if Bruce had not had such a pre dilection for his Shepherds, he must have discovered, that the monuments he found at Axuma himself, the obelisk101, the tot, the table of hieroglyphics, and the sphinxes, are perfectly Egyptian, and not pastoral, Trdglody'tic, Greek, or Arabian. The existence of these monuments appears to me conclusive : for the Arabs were no builders ; and if they had been, their su perstition was perfectly distinct from that of the Abyssinians.

I am not ignorant that Scaliger and Ludolfus both favour the opinion of an Arabian origin, and both find Abasstmi in Arabia, in the neighbourhood of the Homerites. Ludolfus enters largely into the question, and endeavours to prove his assertion, 1. from their religion ; 2. .from their rites and ceremonies, as circumcision, Sec. ; 3. from the formation of their body ; 4. from their language. But I have already shewn that their religion bears no resem blance, and their language is perfectly distinct, both in charac ter and order of writing.

Circumcision is a rite common to almost all hot coun tries ; and though we should allow the formation of their body to be similar, it is far more than counterbalanced by their habits, manners, mode of life, difference of government, and a variety of other characteristicks.

It is not without its difficulties; but Cosmas, from internal evidence, was certainly at Adooli \"\u00b04 him- self, and acquainted with Abyssinia. Ptolemy appears, by the inscription, to have passed the Tacazze, which he calls the Nile, and to have penetrated into Gojam, the very province where the fountains of the Nile are found ; the Agows are men- tioned by name, and other appellations seem to imply the king- doms of Tigre IOi, Bizamo, and Begemder, the country of Geez, with the mountains Samen and Lamalmon.

On this evidence there is little reason to doubt the expedition of Ptolemy to this country ; and however the port of Adooli might be forgotten or abandoned in the time of Agatharchides, it became again conspicuous, as the trade increased in the Red Sea ; or at least as it was conducted under the protection of the Roman power in Egypt. This intercourse will sufficiently account for the character which the Periplils gives to Zoskales109, the civilized state of his manners, and his knowledge of the Greek language. As it is evident that the intercourse was now reassumed, while Pliny mentions Adooli only without any notice of Axdma ; and Strabo, who preceded him, makes no mention of either.

Below Adooli, about eight hundred stadia, or eighty miles, there is a deep bay with a vast accumulation of sand, in which is found the Opsian stone, obtainable no where else. Of the Opsian stone an account is inserted in the catalogue. The bay itself I was unable to ascertain, when the former edition was published ; but Lord Valentia, who has made a survey of the western coast' of the Red Sea, on board a vessel fitted out at Bombay, has fixed upon the Bay of Sarbo, noticed by De Castro, and sufficiently marked on former charts by the island of Houakel, which lies in the centre of it. His Lordship was not able to examine the shore, on account of the shoals which render the approach dangerous ; but these very shoals form the charac- ter of the bay in the Periplils, and the distance assigned is nearly iii exact correspondence ; for it measures on Lord Valentia's chart from Adooli to Cape Sarbo seventy-five miles, which, al- lowing for the winding of the coast, may be reduced to the centre of the bay. From the same authority I am now enabled to correct119 the position of Orine (p. 105.) ; for Orine is not one of the Dahalac islands, but an islet in the southern bosom of the Bay of Masuah. It lies actually twenty miles from the coast ; it is a rock, as its name imports, and much elevated ; it was visited by Lord Valentia, and honoured with his name ; and the bay in which it lies was explored, and received the title of Annesly Bay.

To say we owe the investigation of these circumstances to the enterprise of an English nobleman, is an honour to the ardent spirit of our countrymen ; but to find that they establish the veracity of a Greek author of eighteen hundred years standing, is a satisfaction that can only be felt, in its full extent, by an admirer of the science. From this bay the coast of the gulph, we are informed, has a more easterly direction to the straits : a circumstance agree ing with the maps of Ptolemy, the report of Agatharchides, and the opinion of the age ; and this is in some degree con firmed by Lord Valentia's survey. The straits of Bab-el-mandeb, or Mandel, which is inter preted the gate of affliction, are in all respects worthy of con sideration. They, for many ages, formed the barrier unpassed by Europeans; and from the time this barrier was forced, the knowledge of India and the countries beyond it, has been on the increase to the present hour. I speak of Europeans, be cause I am ready to admit an intercouse between the southern coast of Arabia and Malabar, as early as the most speculative antiquary can require.

Much that the three first Ptolemies had attempted, was neglected, or forgotten by their profligate and oppressive suc cessors ; and if the Ptomans had not taken possession of Egypt, a short succession of weak and ignorant princes might have re duced this commerce again into the same torpid state, it has experienced under the Mammeluks or the Turks. The dread of venturing on the ocean is expressed by many writers long after the trade to India was established ; and Cosmas'\", in the reign of Justin, speaks of passing the straits as wildly as Py'theas does of the Arctic ocean.

Concerning both he speaks with the temperate language of one who describes objects that are fa miliar; and the extravagance, such as he has, commences not till he passes Cape Comorin. In running down the coast from Adooli to the straits, we have no mention of any place but the bay where the Opsian stone is found, upon an extent of near four hundred miles.

We are now to pass the celebrated straits of Bab-el- Mandeb, a name which is sometimes thought to be figured in the Mandaeth of Ptolemy. But Mandaeth he styles a village, and places it forty minutes north of the straits \"'. The straits he calls Deire; II8, or the Neck. The Periplus makes no men tion of Deirk, but observes that the point of contraction is close to Abalites, or the Abalitick mart ; it is from this mart that the coast of Africa, falling down first to the south, and curving afterwards towards the east, is styled the Bay of Ava lites by Ptolemy ; but in the Periplus, this name is confined to a bay immediately beyond the straits, which d'Anville has like wise inserted in his map, but which I did not fully understand, till I obtained Captain Cook's chart on a very large scale, and found it perfectly consistent with the Periplus. The country from the straits to Cape Gardefan or Aromata is the kingdom of Adel ; and in the modern Adel we may perhaps trace a re semblance to the ancient Abal-ites 129. However this may be, the Portuguese, upon their first intercourse with Abyssinia, found Adel a powerful kingdom in the hands of a Mahometan race of sovereigns, the determined enemies of the Christian nanie, and the ravagers of Abyssinia, almost to its destruction.

Albuquerque, the brother of the il lustrious general of that name, was sent to command the troops appointed to this service, in which expedition he and most of his followers perished. But the knowledge which the Portu guese obtained by that intercourse, and the wars in which they were engaged, on the coast of Arabia, with the Turks and Arabs, furnish the principal means that we have for explaining the topography of the country before us ,JI. The English who still frequent the Red Sea, seldom visit the ports of Adel, as the state of the* country presents little temptation to the spe culations of commerce, and the coast is shoal and dangerous. But when the Portuguese first entered these seas, Adel, though a barbarous was still a powerful government132, gold dust, ivory, myrrh, and Abyssinian slaves '\", formed the staple of its native commerce, the spices and muslins of India were still found in its ports, and notwithstanding the depredations of a savage war, caravans 134 were protected, which arrived regularly from Abyssinia, and the interior of Africa more to the south ward. These circumstances will contribute more to illustrate the narrative of the Periplus than any particulars which can be collected from ancient authors ; the Portuguese found the 131 Marmol in this part of his work copies Di Barros.

This state of things ceased, in some degree, with the arrival of the Europeans in India. But as long as the Indian trade was carried on by the Red Sea, the kingdom of Adel must have partaken in it, and its commerce would be similar to the Mosyliitick commerce of the ancients. This trade was singular ; for, as far as can be collected from the authorities which remain, it appears, that in the age of Agatharchides, the Greeks of Egypt went no farther than Sabea or Yemen, to fetch the commodities of India; that they afterwards passed the straits, and found a better market in the port of Mosullon 13S, one of the harbours of Adel ; that in a later period they advanced as far as Hadramaut, on the southern coast of Arabia ; and that all these efforts were made for obtaining the productions of India, till at last they reached that country themselves, first by adhering to the coast, and finally by striking across the ocean in consequence of the dis covery of the monsoon by Hippalus. The coast of Adel, styled Barbaria 13S, in the Periplus, com mences at the straits and terminates at Aromata ; in which there can be little doubt, that the author is more accurate than Ptolemy, who extends the name of Barbaria down the coast of Ajan, the Azania of the Periplus.

The coast of Barbaria is estimated at four thousand stadia'37 in the Periplils, and is in reality four hundred and fifty geo graphical miles, without taking its sinuosities into the account. The straits at Bab-el-Mandeb are contracted to three-and-twenty miles, a space divided into two channels by the intervention of Perim and other isles, both of which wrere navigated by the ancients, according to their course down the opposite sides of the Red Sea. From the straits, the channel opens in an easterly direction to Cape Fartaque on the Arabian side, and to Aro mata or Gardefan on the coast of Africa. These two pro montories form the proper entrance to the straits from the Indian Ocean, and are about two hundred and fifty geographical miles asunder. The latitude135 of Fartaque is 15\u00b0 45' 0\", and that of Gardefan 12\u00b0 0' 0\". The African side of this channel, which we are now to follow, contains, according to the Periplus, four principal marts or anchorages, called by the general name of Ta-pera 13' ; and the 137 Certainly more are intended by the Peri plus but not specified.

D'Anville has placed them according to the measures of the Periplus. My own wish was to have reconciled Mosullon with the modern Zeyla; first, upon account of a resemblance in the sound of the names ; and secondly, because Zeyla is the principal mart of the moderns, as Mosullon \"*\u00b0 was of the ancients. But this endeavour is favoured neither by the measures or the circum stances described. The leading facts upon which the following arrangement is founded, will be stated in their proper place; they amount, at best, only to conjecture ; but this is of less importance, as they terminate in certainty at Aromata, with such striking peculiarities as can be derived only from one who had actually visited the coast himself.

How old this traffick was, is not easy to be determined, but if the ships from Egypt did not pass the straits when Agatharchides wrote, they certainly reached this coast in the time of Artemidorus, as we learn from Strabo, who mentions the bastard cinnamon, perhaps the same as the casia lignea, or hard cinnamon; he adds also, that the cargoes were transferred from the ships to boats at the straits, a proof that this commerce was in its infancy, lib. xvi. p. 7<5S. 774.

If I neglect the measures, it is with regret, but there are circumstances mentioned, which induce me to fix Moondus at Zeyla, or at an island previous, called Londi, by de la Rochette, for Malao and Moondus, in Ptolemy ls6, differ not in longitude ; and his Mosullon is a promontory which may be Barbora, but suits neither of the other two. Another consider ation is, that the Periplus, though it does not actually assert that the direction of the course to the east commences at Moondus, yet mentions it here for the first time; this is true, if Moondus be fixed at Zeyla IS7, and this circumstance is the particular inducement for preferring it.

Moondus has a more Oriental form than Mundus ; and as both this place and Ceylon were possibly so named by the Arabians who traded to both, it is natural to look to the Arabick for its meaning, but it is very dubious.

The trade of Zeyla is described by Al Edrissi as' very important, and the place much frequented by merchants from the Red Sea, avIio consider it as the point of intercourse with Abyssinia li9. I have no better reason for placing Moondus here, than the direction of the course to the east; but if there is no island, Londi would correspond more appropriately with the characters of the place.

At the distance of two or three days' sail, or from an hundred to an hundred and fifty miles, we are conducted to Mosullon, the grand mart of the ancients on this coast, the place which gave name to their trade and to the whole bay, in preference to Abalites, in the estimation of Pliny.

The character of Mosullon163 is omitted in the Periplus, but in Ptolemy it is twice l64 specified as a promontory, and by his latitude it is carried up a whole degree more to the north than Moondus. This projection is doubtless too extensive, but the feature is true, and suits no other point on the whole coast but Barbora, for Barbora l6s is a town upon an island l66 close to the shore, adjoining to a narrow cape of considerable extent, which is open, low, and sandy. Its want of height prevents it from affording protection against the N.E. monsoon, and this may be the reason why the Periplils calls it a bad road. D'Anville has carried Mosullon another step towards the east, to a river where he finds the name of Soel l67, and which he supposes re lated to Mosullon ; but the Periplils requires more rivers than we can discover at present, and this stream may well be pre served for Nilo-Ptolemeon, an appellation in which undoubtedly a river is implied. But there is a still greater probability implied in the very name of Barbora, which is written Borbora, Barbara, and Ber bera by the moderns, retaining still the title of Barbaria, attri- 163 It is remarkable that Juba makes the Atlantick Ocean commence at Mosullon j by which we are to understand that he considered the whole ocean which surrounded Africa as commencing at Mosullon and terminating at Mount Atlas.

The immense wealth of the Sabeans, as de scribed by Agatharchides, proves that in his age the monopoly between India and Europe was wholly in their hands ; but the other tribes of Arabia traded to India also ; and the Greeks of Egypt by degrees found the way to Aden and Hadramaut in Arabia, and to Mosullon on the coast of Africa. Here they found rivals to the Sabean market, and supplied themselves at a cheaper rate. After another course of two days, or an hundred miles, we are conducted to Nilo-Ptolemeon.

At Nilo-Ptolemeon we exhaust three thousand eight hundred out of the four thousand stadia allotted by the Peri plus to the range of marts, which are called by the common name of Ta-pera173; and, speaking in a round number, it may be presumed the author estimates his four thousand as ter minating at this place : this gives a measure of four hundred Roman miles, where the real distance is about four hundred and fifty ; a correspondence certainly sufficient where there is no better estimate of measurement than a ship's course : and, sensible as I am that the particulars of d'Anville are better adapted to the distances at the commencement, the conclusion of the course and the position of Mosullon are more consistent in the arrangement I have adopted.

Neither place or distance is assigned to any of these names, but we may well allot the rivers '\" Daphn6n and Elephant to the synonymous town and cape ; and these may be represented by the modern Mete and Santa Pedra. The river at Mete is described by the Portuguese as dry at certain seasons. When they landed here under Soarez'73 in great distress, they found the place deserted and no water in the river; but a woman whom they seized directed them to open pits in the channel ; and by following her advice, their wants were relieved. Commodore Beaulieu ,7', who anchored a few leagues north of Gardefan, received similar instructions from the natives with the same success. These circumstances are mentioned to identify the existence of rivers on this coast ; and I think I can discover in the map, framed by Sanson for the French edition of Marmol, that the learned geographer paid attention to these rivers of the Periplds. Cape Elephant is formed by a mountain conspicuous in the Portuguese charts, under the name of Mount Felix or Felles, from the native term, Jibbel-Feel l8\u00b0, literally Mount Elephant. The cape is formed by the land jutting up to the north from the direction of the coast, which is nearly east and west ; and from its northernmost point the land falls off again south east1,: to Cape Gardefan, the Ar6mata of the ancients. *77 The principal river of Adel is Hawash, or Howash, but it never reaches the sea.

The whole l8j detail of this coast, from the straits of Bab-el- Mandeb to Cape Gardefan, is principally derived from the Portuguese, who ravaged it under the command of Soarez, in the years 1516 and 1517- Corsali, whose account is preserved in Ramusio, served in the expedition.

Cbaracterisficks of this kind are in many instances indelible, and such it should seem is the nature of this coast, that though it has been possessed by natives, and invaded by the Arabs, both before Mahomed and since, and though the Portuguese afterwards subdued the Mahomedans, still the several districts are so marked, that they may be traced to the present hour ; for the desert coast, the mouths of the Obii, and the tract where the maritime cities and settlements were established, are distinguishable from the dawn of history to the date of the Portuguese discoveries. The manuscript of Ressende, in the British Museum, is an important evidence in this respect, and contains a map drawn up by Bertholet, which specifies the divisions of this coast in perfect harmony with the Periplus. It is this map which I depend upon as a clue to guide me, in preference to every other species of information I have been able to obtain ; and I prefix this detail of the coast upon which I am now to enter, in hopes that it may arrest the attention of the reader, and enable him to accompany me through the whole of the ensuing discussion.

The first trace of this word is found in the Zingisa of Pto lemy199, which he places at Mount Phalangis on the coast of Ajan. It is possible that the commencement of Zanguebar and of the Zingis was placed here by the natives in that early age, or that the influence of the title extended so far. Of this, in deed, there are no traces in the Periplus. I suspect Menu thesias, the term used in that work, to be equivalent in its application to the extension of the modern title Zanguebar, from the island to the coast ; but of this I speak not without hesitation. We are now to commence the consideration of the marts, and the first of these is Tabai. TAB A I. XIII. Tabai is characterised as a great\"00 promontory by the Peripl&s, and can therefore be referred to no other point but the d'Affui of our modern charts ; for below Aromata there is no other conspicuous cape upon the coast. It is written Orfui, d'Orfui, Arfur, d' Arfur, and Carfur, probably for Cape Arfur, and once Asun MI, as I suspect for Afun.

A similar relation we might fancy between Afun and Opone, or Ophone ; but without the knowledge of a lan o-uacre to which we ajight refer it, the whole is mere conjecture. Behveen Gar-dafui and Dafui there is doubtless some cor- respondence. At Aromata the Periplus marks, in the most pointed manner, that the coast falls in towards the south ; and in a subsequent passage, specifies its southerly and south-westerly direction to the limits of ancient discovery. But. our immediate concern is with Tabai ; and the position of Aromata, between Cape Ele phant on the west and Tabai on the south, is as perfect a dis tinction as Gardafui obtains from modern geography, with all its light. The author expressly mentions, that this cape lies farther east than Apokopa, and it is inreality the most eastern point of the continent. The trade for spices carried on at this place was in a road to the north of the cape, as we collect from a circumstance de pendent on the moonsoon ; for we are informed that the an chorage is totally exposed to the north, and at some seasons extremely dangerous. The prognostick of bad weather is pe culiar to the spot, for the sea changes colour, and rises turbid from the bottom. Upon this appearance, the vessels which are at anchor here weigh instantly, and fly 203 to Tabai for shelter: there they find a great promontory, and under it pro tection from the storm. The author certainly does not advert Beaulieu ascertains Gardafui as the point ing the change of the season, and ready to that divides the monsoon.

The ignorance of the author is in favour of his veracity ; for had he known all the properties of the cause, the effect could not have been described in terms more appropriate : and whatever difficulties have occurred in tracinrr the coast of Adel, we are here amply recompensed by the locality of the three capes, and the circumstances dependent on a pheno menon which the author could not invent, and which, if he had not experienced, he could hardly have described. The articles of commerce obtained at Aromata we may col lect from itsr'title, for Aromata is a Greek term, where we should have wished the native appellation to have been pre served ; and whatever its signification may be in other writers, in the present instance certainly expresses gums, odours, spices, and fragrant productions of every kind. No particulars, how ever, are mentioned at this cape, but at Tabai or Daffui it is noticed, that the articles of import were the same as those brought to the coast of Barbaria or Adel, and that the com modities received in return were native produce, consist ing of Cinnamon Kourcrtcx.

With all these different species of cinnamon, can we be sur prized if the ancients fixed (the regio cinnamomifera) the growth of cinnamon in the neighbourhood ? for cinnamon was the first spice coveted by the ancients, and sought for with equal avidity b\\r all the modern navigators, when they first found their way into the seas of India. At Aromata terminates the ancient Barbaria and modern Adel, and here the coast of Azania204 or Ajan commences. In this our author is more correct than Ptolemy, who extends the limits of Barbaria to the south. The distance of this cape from Daffui is between seventy and eighty miles, (which Ptolemy205 has extended to an hundred and seventy,) and tfoe intervening space is called the Bay of Belha or Beila.

I have since found reason to think that Ptolemy has transposed Zengisa and Opone, and am con vinced by Mr. Gossellin, the Oriental Navigator, and Captain Bissell's journal, that wherever Zengisa is placed, it still bears the features of Daffui. Ptolemy- notices Mount Phalangis at Zengisa, with three heads ; two of these appear in the Oriental Navigator ; and Captain Bissell writes, Dorfui has three projections or capes, the largest in the centre. He mentions likewise the bay ad joining as very deep, which seems to be Opone, and that Dorfui appears like an island, which in fact it is, as we learn from the commander of an Indian2'6 vessel, shipwrecked here in 1802. The survivors reached Gardafui, after much ill treatment, in six days, and at last from Cape Elephant obtained a passage to Mokha. We have now a mart at Opone subsequent to Tabai, and from thence a desert coast, which is a total blank to Apokopa, or Cape Baxas ; that is, a space of four hundred and twenty miles, in perfect correspond ence with Ressende and Bertholet. A kingdom called Adea207 is placed here, which the authors of the Universal History treat as a fiction, and so does Ludolfus ; but he adds, that the na tives are called Hadiens, that is, Ajans ; and hence is the cor ruption of Adeans and Adea. 106 Asiatick Annual Register, 1802.

The next mart which occurs in the Periplus is Op6ne, four hundred stadia, or forty miles from Tabai : to reach it you must follow the shore of the Chersonese, formed by the pro montory, and you have a strong current263 setting round the coast in your favour. In the journal this is perfectly clear and intelligible ; but the Opone of Ptolemy is so different, that d'Anville has placed one Opone previous to Tabai, and that of the Periplus subsequent. There is in fact some great error or fluc tuation in Ptolemy himself; for in his Catalogue, p. 112, Opone is only two degrees from Aromata, and three-fourths of a de gree from Panopros ; while in Book I. chap. 17, Opone is six days sail from Panon, which is the same village. Now this village is in the bay which succeeds Ar6mata, that is, the Bay of Beila ; and if the distance had been taken even from Aro- mata itself, it is wonderfully in excess. But the village of Panon, in the Catalogue, is written Panopros, which we may conjecture to be [Uavo^ocruTiuv,'] characterising a village of the natives, who have the hideous countenance of Pan ; and Panon is the village of Pans. Some fable of this kind probably at tached to this coast.

Here, likewise, is the commencement210 of his Azania ; and if we con sider that Zengisa implies the Zinguis or Blacks, we find in this word the peculiar appellation of the Caffie coast, and the first mention of that name which afterwards gave title to Zanguebar. It is in Zengisa and Phalangis, fully identified with d'Affui\"' by Captain Bissell, that we obtain a fixed point of the highest importance. He mentions likewise a bay which falls into the southward of this promontory, and terminates at Cape Del gado; and at Cape Delgado commences the Bandel Caus' of the Portuguese. Either of these bays would afford anchorage for the vessels from Egypt ; for the description of the former, and the distance of the latter, may justify the claim of either to represent the Opone of the ancients. After the establishment of these correspondencies, it is with re gret I am compelled to acknowledge that it is as impossible to reconcile the Zengisa of Ptolemy with the following distance to Apokopa, as with the preceding interval from Panopros ; for Apo kopa stands in the Catalogue only 30 minutes south of Zengisa, and is estimated at two days' sail in the 17th chapter, which can not be consistent, for the two courses are specified as a day 2I2 and night each. But I suspect that there is an error of a dif ferent sort ; for the Periplus has two Apokopas, the Less and the Greater ; and in the Catalogue of Ptolemy we have first 210 The Periplus makes the coast of Bar- !\" It is an island, according to the account baria terminate at Aromata, but does not posi- of Kinsai, principal officer of the Fazi AHum, tively mention the commencement of Azania wrecked in this neighbourhood. there. \"F NvxV?\u00ab- VOL.

I assume (and it admits of proof) this Apokopa for the Southern2\" Horn of the Catalogue, and the Greater Apokopa of the Peri plfts, because it is immediately followed by the Less and Greater coast ; if so, a course of two days and two nights could not reach it, for the distance of the Southern Horn and the Greater Apokopa is upwards of six degrees, or 420 miles, from Daffui or Zengisa. apokoka. XV. It is no predilection in favour of my author, which in duces me to prefer the order and allotment of the Peripltis to that of Ptolemy, but a. conviction that the merchant actually performed the voyage himself, and that Ptolemy's information was founded on inquiry only. That it is not correct appears evidently from the discordance of his measures, compared with his latitudes ; and I shall immediately shew, that by fixing Opone subsequent to Tabai, the two Apokopas correspond with the only two points noticed on this coast of desolation : \"\"' The Southern Horn of Ptolemy must not be confounded with the Southern Horn of Strabo ; for if his cape of that name has a precise representative, it is Ar6mata.

This account is from Artemidorus, and the 5000 stadia are in correspondence with the Periplus. Major Rennell lays great stress on making the Western Horn of Hanno an inlet, and not a promontory ; but the \"Eo-x^a Ktfas of Western Africa, and the N&'t\u00ab Ktgz; of Strabo and Ptolemy, are all capes ; and the term K/{tz; seems usually applied to mark the limit of discovery in different countries and different ages."], [189, "AZANIA. 155 these are Morro Cobir and Cape Baxas, or Shoal Cape214. I have no hesitation in assuming these two projections, for Morro 2'5 Cobir is described in the Oriental Navigator with the peculiar character of a bluff\"6 ; and if I had wished to render Apokopa by a nautical term in English, 1 could have found no expression more appropriate. Cape Baxas is described in the same work with features equally singular and consistent. \" The \" land,\" we are informed, \" is steep, and projects more into the \" sea than the rest of the coast.\" Thus it appears that we have the three,, capes or head-lands, which are the only conspi cuous points on a coast four hundred miles in extent, marked with characters that are indelible ; that is, Zengisa or Tabai distinguished by its forked head, and the two Apokopas desig nated as bluff and steep. My own errors, in regard to the two former, I am happy to have this opportunity of retracting ; and equally happy am I to acknowledge that I am indebted to M. Gossellin for attracting my attention to the character istick of Zengisa, which has led to the rectification of the whole. The season for the commencement of the voyage from Egypt to all these ports beyond the straits, is in Epiphi or July. This is an early date,, but not inconsistent with the monsoon ; for it required thirty days to Bab-el-Mandeb, and from thence to Aromata the wind was in their favour : but they could not pass that cape till November \"7 at the soonest, and therefore they 1,4 In the Oriental Navigator, p.

This seems a space more than necessary, but produces nothing inconsistent with the nature of the monsoons. I must not, however, leave the adjustment of this coast without mentioning another circum stance, that I should have been glad to discover at Cape Baxas, which is a river \"' mentioned in the Periplfis, as a ter mination of the six days' course from Opone to Apokopa : but for the existence of such a stream I have no authority, ancient or modern ; neither is it a question likely to be determined, for there is nothing here to attract a navigator, and it lies out of the track of all voyages which are usually made in these lati tudes. But an interval of 350 or 360 miles between Opdne and this cape is in full correspondence with a course of six days ; and a remark that the coast at this point takes a still farther inclination to the south-west, can be applied to no other promontory in this tract. It has been necessary to take this view of the whole district now under consideration, before we entered upon the commerce with which it was connected ; but of commerce there is not a single trace after leaving Opone.

It is, I apprehend, the first historical evidence of an intercourse between India and Africa, inde pendent of the voyages to Arabia : it'evidently implies the ad vantage taken of the monsoons, and leads us to suppose that this navigation was practised from the most remote ages that men can be imagined to have ventured on the ocean. This is the same state of a communication with India as the Portu guese found, when they arrived at Mosambique, Mombasa, and Melinda, after an interval of eighteen centuries, and which continues, in some measure, to the present, day. The same form of government was likewise found by the Por tuguese as is noticed in the Periplus ; for it is stated, that both at Opone. and other marts on the coast, there was neither empire or territory under the government of a king, but that each separate city had its own sovereign223, independent of all the others. In some few instances, indeed, the Arabs had procured an influence, and established factories which con trolled the natives, much in the same manner as the Europeans have since intruded themselves in this part of the world, and in almost every other.

In fixing this Southern Horn at Cape Baxas, or the Shoal Cape of the Portuguese, I am not only directed by d'Anville226, but confirmed by the detail of the coast. And that the Peri plus means Apokopa for a promontory is clear from a previous passage, where, when it is stated that Cape Aromata is the most eastern point of all Africa, it is peculiarly marked as more to the east than Apokopa ; a certain proof that Apokopa itself also is a promontory ; and if so, there is nothing within dis tance north or south, which can answer to it, but the Southern Horn of Ptolemy, and the Cape Baxas of the moderns. The mention of a river227 here by the author is the only circum stance for which we find no equivalent in the modern ac counts. It is worthy of remark, that the termination of ancient know ledge on the western coast of Africa was a horn as well as on the eastern ; the Western Horn 22S is a limit to the voyage of Hanno, and the geography of P. Mela, as this Southern Horn formed have now ; and Egypt had fleets on the Medi terranean, after it was subjected to the Per sians and Greeks : but these are not native. Before the Persian conquest, we hardly hear of an Egyptian vessel, either for commerce or war.

Essina he places under the Line, and Brava is only one degree to the north of it; and though 'little is to be built upon his latitudes, it is remarkable, that his error is greatest at the commencement of the coast, and diminishes in its pro gress to the south. At Gardefan it is near six degrees, at Cape Baxas it is little more than two, and at Brava it may, by pro portion, be diminished to one. But there is another method of reducing our conjectures to certainty ; which is, by taking a proportion of six to seven ; in which case, if we fix the termination of the six days' sail at Magadasho, the conclusion of the remaining seven coincides sufficiently with Mombaca, the correspondence of which will be established by a variety of deductions, so as hardly to leave a doubt upon the arrangement. Within the space which is allotted to this Little and Great Coast, amounting nearly to five degrees of latitude, we find only one place noticed on our modern charts, which is Maga dasho 23\u00b0. I dare not say that this has any relation to the Megas 2J1 of the Greeks, but I recommend it to the inquiries of the Orientalists ; for Ma and Maha signify great in the Sanskreet and Malay, and in this sense most probably enter into the com position of Madagascar in the neighbourhood.

Among the number of these streams must be comprehended the mouths of the Quilimance, or Grand River of d'Anville; it falls into the sea not far from Melinda by several mouths, and in the islands formed by the division of the stream, or in their neighbourhood, we find Pat&236, Sio, Am paca, and Lamo, obscure places, where there was some trade when the Portuguese first discovered this coast237.

The great240 river which forms these islands is called the Obii 241 by the Portuguese : they sailed up it for several days, and describe it as a magnificent stream : it possibly derives its origin from the south of the Abyssinian mountains, as the Nile flows from the northern side, and per- haps gives rise to a geographical fable of Ptolemy and the early writers, who derive the source of the Nile from a lake in the latitude of sixteen degrees south242. The two first anchorages of the seven are called Serapion242 and Nikon244, both in Ptolemy and the Periplus; and it does not appear clearly from the text of the latter, whether they are to be reckoned inclusive or exclusive.

Cio had six hundred, and was a piratical state. Ampaca had fifteen hundred, was tributary to the Portuguese, and much attached to the na tion. These were divided by different branches of the river, but Lamo was more splendid than the others, had a king of its own, and fifteen hundred Moorish troops. It was tributary to Portugal, but no Portuguese resided in the city. The trade of all these places consisted in dates, Indian corn, and provisions. 241 Ptolemy in 120 30' o\", or 130 o' o\". 343 Whatever doubt may arise about Nikon, from the fluctuation of orthography, there can be no hesitation in allowing that Serapion must be the name of an Egyptian, or an Egyptian Greek. Voyagers of this sort frequently gave their names to ports first visited by them, or had this honour conferred upon them by others ; thus we have, in Strabo, the altars or ports of Pitholaus, Liehas, Pythangtlus, Leon, and Charimotrus, on the coast between Mount Elephant and the Southern Horn. Strabo^ lib. xvi. p. 769. et seq. from Artemidorus. Cicero mentions a Serapion as a geographer who contradicted Eratosthenes.

I could wish to assume Brava for Serapi6n, though I have nothing to support my opinion but the mention of a pro montory there by Ptolemy ; and there is a small head-land at Brava, which is the Berva of Al Edrissi. But if the two an chorages are to be included in the number, two days' sail, or an hundred miles, must be deducted from the total, a difference far more excusable in an ancient journal than a modern one. These names, evidently derived from the Greeks, afford no means of finding an equivalent for either, but in regard to the seven rivers and anchorages, our evidence is complete ; for the names of these rivers inserted in Bertholet are, I. Boubo ; 2. Jugo ; 3. Mane ; 4. Quiami ; 5. Punta da Bagona ; 6\". Patte; 7- Mandaro. It is impossible not to see in this enumeration a correspondence with the Periplus. There \"are no contiguous rivers in any part of the coast above, and none lower down till after we are past Cape Delgado ; besides this we may add, that they are prior to Menoothias, which must be one of the Zan guebar islands, as it lies thirty miles from the coast. Between the limit, therefore, of Brava and Mombaca these rivers must be looked for ; and if found, demonstration itself cannot require more. The termination of this seven days' course is fixed at the Puralaan islands, and a place strangely named the New Canal. But if we suppose these islands to be those previous to Mom baca, that is, Sio, Ampaca, Pate, and Lamo, (which are all situated at the mouths of the Obii, and insulated by the issues of that river,) their number requires five streams to enclose them, and d'Anvilie gives us six ; to these we may add a seventh between Brava and Sio, which he styles Bubo, and thus we"], [201, "AZANIA. 167 have the seven which the journal requires. It may be thought presumptuous to refer their name to a Greek origin ; but with a very slight alteration of the reading, the Puralian245 islands are the islands of the Fiery Ocean : and a term more appropriate could hardly be adopted on a course which commences at the equator, and extends to four degrees of latitude south. Sera pidn and Nikon have both an affinity to the Greek, and one of them is apparently represented by Brava, in latitude 1\u00b0 north, immediately preceding this district of the seven rivers; Aro mata, Rhapta, and Apokopa are all Greek likewise, and no thing seems more consonant to reason than for a Greek to apply the name of the Fiery Ocean to a spot which was the centre of the torrid zone, and subject to- the perpendicular rays of an equinoctial sun. The first Greek that sailed in such a climate would naturally conclude that lie had reached the point, where all the ancients believed that the world was rendered unin habitable by heat ; and the heat which he would actually ex perience, would naturally suggest the name appropriate to such a sea, and the islands which it contained. This may be ima gination, but to my apprehension it decidedly presents the re semblance of truth, and I have very little hesitation in assuming this district for the course of the seven rivers, or in styling Sio, Ampaca, Pale, and Lamo, the islands of the Fiery Ocean, or the Equinoctial Islands. Ptolemy has omitted entirely the mention of these rivers and islands ; a cause sufficient why Marmol, d'Anville, and Gossellin should assume Melinda, or some place near it, for Rhapta. But the authority of the Peri plus is sufficient for restoring them, and from them deducing the real limit of the navigation. \u25a0*\u2022' nvgaXiofj Marine Fire, from nZ(, fire, aAws, marine. nSe aAiov, fire of the sea."], [202, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 168 j i NEW CANAL, MOMBACA. XVIII. The preference due to Mombaca is founded upon a variety of combinations. It has been noticed already, that by the two divisions of this tract from Apokopa [Cape Baxas] to the Puralaan islands, the proportion of six days' sail to seven would direct us to Mombasa, and it must be observed now, that two hundred miles southward would carry us to one of the three Zanguebar islands, and another hundred miles added to this would conduct us to the neighbourhood of Quiloa; these, how ever deficient, are the distances of the Periplus to Rhapta, and at Quiioa or Cape Delgado must be fixed the limit of discovery in the age of the author. In treating of this limit, Quiloa will be generally assumed as more conspicuous, as it is a place of importance, and as it is the seat of an Arabian government, certainly more ancient than the Periplus itself. Let us now consider the title of the New Canal as applicable to Mombaca. Castaneda speaks of this city as seated on an island hard by the firm land. Osorius describes it as on a rock, with the sea ahnost surrounding it; and almost might easily be reduced to nothing by a canal. Faria calls it an island made by a river, which falls into the sea by two mouths. Marmol joins it to the continent by a causey at low water. But the authors246 of the Universal History write still more pointedly : \" This city was once a peninsula, but hath since been made an 546 Castaneda, p. 22. Osorius, vol. i. p. 60. French ed.

The proof of this is impossible, but every probability is in fa vour of the supposition, that we may place this anchorage at Mombapa. EH APT A. XIX. The passage from Mombaca to Rhapta was made by two courses, consisting of a day and night each, equal to two thousand stadia, ending at an island thirty miles from the coast; and two others of a day each, amounting to one thousand. This mart obtained its name among the navigators, who were Greeks, from the word \u00a3\u00abVr\u00ab, which signifies to sew, and was applied to this place because they found here vessels not built like their own, but small, and raised from a bottom of a single piece, by the addition of planks which were sewed together24' [with the fibres of the cocoa], and which had their bottoms paid with some of the odoriferous resins of the country. Is it not one of the most extraordinary facts in the history of navigation, that this peculiarity should be one of the first objects which attracted the admiration of the Portuguese upon their reaching the same coast, at the distance of almost fifteen centuries ?

They ravaged the coast, it is true, as they razed Aden, and they col lected a tribute as early as the rei^n of Clau dius, as appears by the account of Plokamus's freedman, and so did the Portuguese upon several coasts where they had not an inch of territory ; but the Romans never had a pro vince on this part of the coast of the Red Sea, or on the ocean. If they had an Arabia prima and secunda, these must have been in Petrea, south of Jordan. It is for this reason, I think, that IIPfiTHS has no relation to a Latin term, but belongs to Yemen, the first and principal state of Arabia Felix, the king of which was Charibatl, with whom the Romans always treated, and Maphar or Mopharites appears to be a territory under that division.

One circumstance, however, is worthy of still farther notice, which is, that the influence of the Arabs was divided between two separate powers ; for Maphartis was subject to Khol&bus, and Moosa to Kharibael. This division of interests is con sistent with the manners of the Arabs. At Judda, the customs were divided between the Soldan of Egypt and the Imaum, in the sixteenth century ; and at Adhab, on the African side of the Red Sea, where the pilgrims embarked for Judda, the re venue was shared between the King of Bega and the Soldan 2!* of Egypt. Something similar is mentioned in the Peripltis at Socotra.

For as the fleets of Solomon are said to have obtained gold on this coast, as well as the Arabs of a later age, and the Portuguese, we naturally look for it in a commerce which is intermediate; and the nearer we approach to Sofala the more reason there is to ex pect it. Our present object, however, is not the trade but the geography. It has been already stated 257, that the measures of the Peri plils accord with the degrees of latitude between Gardafui and Quiloa within five miles 25', a disagreement upon twenty degrees wholly insignificant. But if it should be thought that the mea sure by a day's course is too vague to support the assumption of Quiloa for Rhapta, it may be answered, that in a voyage performed both ways, with the different monsoons, and re peated yearly, this estimate may be reduced almost to a cer tainty ; far more so at least than any courses the Greeks could estimate in the Mediterranean. Ptolemy's objection to this will be considered in its proper place : for the present it is suf ficient to say, that the agreement of the measures is a general cause for presuming that Rhapta is Quiloa, strengthened more esoecially by the peculiarities of the coast coinciding with the detail of the journal, and all pointing to the same spot. The seven days' courses terminating each at a river, cannot be ap plicable to any tract but the coast of Melinda, comprehending the mouths of the Obii, and the termination of these at Mom baca, which is assumed either as one of tlie Pyralaan islands, or as a place strangely marked by the title of the New Canal. ni gee Table. but if it can be reconciled within a degree, or 258 It is not meant to build on this ap- even two, the correspondence is extraordi. proximation : the charts differ considerably, nary."], [208, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 174 From this anchorage we are now to particularize the passage to Rhapta. The first step is a course of two thousand 2S9 stadia to an island which lies three hundred stadia, or thirty miles, from the continent ; and for such an island we have our choice out of three, which have nearly the same offing. One of the three it is undoubtedly, and it is more necessary to identify this, if possible, because Rhapta and the termination of the voyage depend upon it ; it is for this reason that I have reserved it for a separate consideration, because if satisfaction can be obtained on this point, it removes all objections. MENOOTIIESIAS. XX. This isle is the Eitenediommenoothesias of the Peri plus260, a term egregiously strange and corrupted, but out of which the commentators unanimously collect Menoothias, whatever may be the fate of the remaining syllables. That this Menoothias must be one of the Zanguebar islands is in dubitable 261 ; for the distance from the coast of all three, Pemba, Zanguebar, and Monfia, affords a character which is indelible ; a character applicable to no other island from Gardafui to Madagascar. Which of the three it may be, should not hastily be determined, but it can hardly be Pemba, which is the first, or most northerly, because, if the first were touched at, the others must have been passed, and ought to have been \"' Stuckius makes it only eighty miles from isles to answer to the Zanguebar islands, or Mombaca to Zanguebar, but this cannot be Zanguebar itself; but it is evident the Py correct. ralaans are near the main, and these at thirty ralaans are near the main, and these at thirty 260 See Appendix, No. iii. miles distance. \"' Stuckius, p. 31. supposes the Pyralaan"], [209, "AZANIA. 175 > noticed ; neither would the distances agree, either from the ]S[ew Canal to Pemba, or from Pemba to Rhapta. Zanguebar as the centre and most conspicuous naturally attracts our at- tention, and Zanguebar is assumed by Vossius in opposition to Salmasius, Stuckius, and a cloud of opponents262. Not that we must suppose Vossius prejudiced in favour of one of these islands more than another, but that it must be one of the three, and ought to be that with which the distances of the journal are most consistent. The journal is very precise on this head, it gives two hundred miles from the New Canal to Menoo- thias, and one hundred from Menoothias to Rhapta ; marking at the same time the distance of the island from the main, and the return of the course from the island to the continent. A reference to the map will now shew that these measures agree best with the course from Mombaca to MonsiaX This point, however, it is not now necessary to determine. But before we proceed in our inquiry, our attention is first due to the descrip- tion of the island in the Periplus : in this we have more charac- teristicks than usual, and some of them may lead hereafter to discover the particular island which is intended ; for it is dis- tinguished as low and woody** ; it is said to have rivers, to abound with a variety of birds, and with the mountain or land tortoise. It has no noxious animals, for though it produces crocodiles, they are harmless. The natives use the Rhapta or name. There can be little doubt that Zoco tora is a native term of the earliest date, but the Greeks turned it into Dioscorides at the first step. Possibly Monfia was made Monthia' in the same manner; possibly also some affinity might still be traced from the natives. 262 See Salmas. Plinian. Exerc. p. 1243 Vossius ad Melam.

These circumstances, it is probable, will enable some future visitor to determine jvhich of the isles we are to call Menoothias; that it is one of them is demonstrable. There is some reason for thinking Zanguebar is not low*1 ; whether Monfia is so, no means of information have yet oc curred 268, and as to the crocodiles which do no harm, I should have supposed them to be the very large lizards not unfrequent in these latitudes, if I had not observed that the journal, when treating of Socotra, mentions both crocodiles and very large lizards . which the natives eat 26'. Crocodiles will hardly be found in islands which cannot have rivers of any great extent or depth. After these deductions, there is every reason to conclude, that the Menoothias of the Peripliis is fixed indubitably at one 265 Barbosa notices this circumstance at the Zanguebar islands. the sea. From this form I conclude it to be tow, which is one of the characters of Menoo thias in the Periplus. But a reef-like island does not present the idea suggested by that journal, which seems to intimate space and ex tension. Ressende indeed says it is the largest island of the three, and twenty-five leagues in length. MS. in the Brit.

This is a point which has em ployed so much pains to settle, because upon this depend the conclusion of the journal, and the limit of discovery. But let us next examine the course, for we have three 271 thousand stadia to dispose of, which amount to three hundred miles, while the real distance from Mombaca to Quiloa is more than three hundred and fifty. I cannot think that this difference creates a difficulty in comparing an ancient journal with modern precision ; and if it were allowable to assume Monfia for Menoothias, it would relieve the distance both ways. But a reference to Mr. Arrowsmith's map of Africa has convinced me that Pemba lies out of the course, and is too much to the eastward to be noticed ; that Monfia is by no means conspi cuous, and that Zanguebar is so prominent and obvious above the other two, that it might well attract the particular attention of navigators, and cause the others to be disregarded ; but however the distance from this island to Quiloa may be de ficient, its precise offing of thirty miles from the main counter balances all other objections. The habits of the natives are 270 Sixty geographical miles are equal to seventy- five Roman. Castaneda says, ten leagues, p. 67. seven hundred stadia, and a night's sail six hundred, that is, thirteen hundred for the vo^Sb^e'jo.-. If this were admitted here, the distance might be reconciled ; but two different measures are not admissible in the same work, however authors vary. See Wes seling in loco. 271 I have reckoned throughout the whole navigation a day's sail at five hundred stadia, and that of a day and night at a thousand ; not that any measure of this sort is correct, for Herodotus, lib. iv. p. 321. makes a day's sail VOL. II. A A"], [212, ",78 PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. likewise to be considered ; for their employment, their vessels, their trade in tortoise-shell, continue the same to the present dav. With all these points of resemblance, surely it is impos sible that imagination should mislead us ; and if we are not deceived, Zanguebar is Menoothias, and Rhapta may safely be assumed for Quiloa. But we are no otherwise determined to Quiloa, as to its present site, than as a known place, and from the supposition that the convenience of the spot might have attracted the natives or the Arabs, to fix a city here in the early ages as well as the later. All these cities or marts upon the coast were independent272 of each other, and all under the government of their respective sovereigns ; but the whole territory of Rhapta was subject to Kholebus, the king of Maphartis in Arabia, and his authority was of long standing. The journal calls Rhapta the last2'1 harbour of Azania, and the termination of discovery. The modern, Ajan is bounded at Cape Baxos, or as others state, at the Obii, and the coast from thence to Cape Corrientes, comprehending the modern Quiloa, is styled Zanguebar ; it is this coast which Marco Polo calls the island27\" of Zanguebar, to which he gives an extent of two thousand miles, and in which he is not more mistaken than Ptolemy in his Menoothias, or in the inclination he gives this continent towards the east. The Periplus fixes its own limit without monsters, prodigies, or anthropophagi ; a circumstance this, above all others, which gives reason to suppose that the author visited it himself2\"; for *\u00bb* This is the second time-these petty princes that he took his account from Arabian autho are noticed in the Periplus, and manifests the rity ; for the Arabs call every country an intention of the auther to mark it as a pecu- island which they approach by sea. liarity of the coast. 2?s ubi desinit cognitio, ibi fingendi incipit \"3 ii ti?ihlt\u00abiototov f/xTc'fiov T^f Ai>Was. licentia.

It has been our present business to consider the site assumed for Rhapta at Quiloa, with the several circumstances that at tend it. The points of the compass remain still to be considered ; but this is a subject on which I have owned my incapacity, in former instances, to give satisfaction ; and on the present oc casion, I had rather impute the failure to my own inability, than to the mistake of the author. But if I interpret275 his lan guage right, he says that the island lies, in respect of the New Canal, more than south-west, and nearly direct west. This is not true of any island on the coast : Zanguebar lies very nearly south from Mombaca, and Quiloa south-west from Zanguebar. I cannot reconcile this, and as I am obliged to abandon the ground I had taken in my former discussion of this question, I will not now amuse the reader with conjecture : if any solu tion of the difficulty should occur, either to men of literature or professional men, 1 shall receive it with gratitude.

It must be observed, that this is very much in harmony with the actual site of Quiloa, which is on an island in a bay at the mouth of the river Goavo*77, with Cape Delgado at the distance of somewhat more than a degree to the south. D'Anville has assumed Delgado for the Prasum of Ptolemy, in which I should not so confidently say that he is mistaken, if I had not proved that he has totally neglected the Menoothias of the Periplus, the very point upon which all our positions in the neighbourhood depend. But if the Rhapta of Ptolemy and the Periplus are the same, of which there is no doubt, then the circumstances of Ptolemy apply to Quiloa, and to no other place upon the coast. In this opinion I am not singular; for Vossius 27', as he agrees with me in making Menoothias Zanguebar, unites279 also in allotting Rhapta to Quiloa. i. It is always with regret that I dissent from d'Anville, as I am compelled to do in the present instance ; but it seems extra ordinary, that both he and M. Gossellin should identify Zan guebar with Menoothias, and yet not see that the Periplus 2,7 See the Voyage of Thomas Lopez, in Ramusio, vol. i. p. 134. Fra. Quilloa nuova e la vecchia e uno fiumo.

This circumstance appears to me absolutely conclusive against Mombaca, or any of the places at the mouths of the Obii, and in favour of Quiloa. The source of their error seems to be derived from Ptolemy, who drops the coast of Seven Rivers, and passes from Nikon to Rhapta, without notice of any intermediate step. PRASUM. XXI. It is now to be observed, that Ptolemy 28\u00b0 in going down the coast of Africa, as he has the same names with the Periplus 2Sl, so has he the same termination at Rhaptum ; for his Prasum and his Menuthias are thrown to the conclusion of his account of Africa, and do not appear to be collected from any regular journal like this before us; but to be founded upon the report of some voyagers who had advanced farther south, in the intermediate time which had elapsed between the date of the Periplus and that of his own publication. But if it follows from this that the Periplus is prior to Ptolemy, so is there great reason to believe, that if he did not copy this journal as low as it went, it was one nearly of the same age. The hesitation with which he speaks of all below Rhapta proves that he had no re gular data to proceed upon, and however he rebukes Marinus for error in his calculations, which, if adhered to, would have compelled him to carry Prasum to latitude thirty-four degrees south 2S\\ he himself has a method by no means more efficacious. !8; It is a remarkable circumstance that this should be nearly the latitude of the Gape of 280 Africa, cap. vii. table iv *' See Table."], [216, "i8\u00bb PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. Marinus, it seems, was upon his guard, and had reduced this excess to 23\u00b0 30' 0\" south, or the tropick of Capricorn ; but Ptolemy objects to this, as still too distant, and reduces Prasum to latitude 15\u00b0 30' south, because, says he, the people there are black, and the country produces the elephant and the rhino ceros, circumstances which occur in latitude 15\u00b0 north in Ethiopia, and consequently ought to occur again as many de grees south of the equator. This method of fixing a latitude is by no means satisfactory to Ramusio; for he tells us he was ac quainted with a Portuguese pilot who was well read in Pto lemy183, and who objected28\" very acutely, that if this ground were admitted, the inhabitants of Spain ought to be of the same colour with the Hottentots ; for the straits of Gibraltar are nearly in the same latitude north as the Cape of Good Hope south. Without insisting upon this, it is evident that Ptolemy had no data from the journals to proceed on. But when he places Rhaptum in latitude S\u00b0 25' 0\" south, and Prasum in 15\u00b0 30' south, he makes but one step of seven degrees, without a feature of the coast, or a circumstance intervening, which might enable us to judge whether the voyage had ever been performed or not ; except that a nation of Ethiopians or Neoro Anthropophagi closes the account. At Rhapta concludes the journal of the Periplus, and all the knowledge of the ancients at Prasum. My own arrangement of the coast was fixed before I had seen M.

I have now reviewed the whole with the most scrupulous attention, and have found no reason to abandon the ground on which I stood. Such additional proofs as I obtained, I have now inserted ; and such errors as I have discovered, I have corrected. A material one, in regard to the Phalangis of Ptolemy, I was not aware of, till I found that M. Gossellin had ascertained its character beyond dispute. Fortunately it did not interfere with the subsequent positions ; and the acknowledgment of my mistake, in this instance, is a proof of my readiness to retract upon conviction. But in re- gard to my termination of the voyage at Quiloa, it is so de- cidedly fixed by the coast of Seven Rivers, by the distance of three thousand stadia from thence to the south, and by the island thirty miles from the coast, that the evidence appears to me incontrovertible. To these characteristicks, Ptolemy2'5 adds a river at the port, a cape one degree and a half south of the port, with a projection of almost three degrees from the con- tinent : the whole of this answers so essentially to Quiloa, and Cape Delgado, and to nothing else on the whole coast, that the idea of misconception seems impossible. I am ready to admit that the number of stadia is too small, and the projection of the Cape too large ; still the general features of resemblance are so numerous and so unequivocal, that in my own opinion Latitude.

I shall now subjoin a Table*, which will present the whole arrano-ement of the coast from Gardefan to Quiloa in one view ; and if it does not afford that conviction to others which I feel myself, I have laboured much without effect. plus, as to afford the strongest reason for identifying that island with Menoothias. But it ought not to-be concealed, that the charac ter attributed by Captain Bissell to Pemba is low and woody ; the exact raw-sin) xal xawa&v. Jijo, of the Periplus. Still the termination of the voyage would not be affected by the doubt which this might cause, in regard to fixing upon any one of the three islands in preference to the other two ; for though they occupy three degrees and an half of latitude, there is no place of consequence on the coast below the most northern point of Pemba, till we arrive at Quiloa. I still give the preference to Zan guebar, on account of the distance ; and am not without hopes that stronger points of cor respondence will be traced by future informa tion. * Since the construction of this Table, I have obtained, by favour of Mr. Dalrymple, the journal and charts of Captain Bissell, a most intelligent officer, who commanded the Leopard, a ship of Commodore Blanket's squadron, in the expedition to the Red Sea, 1 79S. This fleet was detained for forty weeks, struggling against the north-east monsoon; a circumstance peculiarly favourable for settling the hydrography of the coast. The observa tions likewise appear to have been taken with every advantage which could be expected from the most skilful officers, assisted with the best of instruments. In Captain Bissell's chart, Pemba is laid down in latitude 50 south, nearly at 52 miles Roman from the coast ; and Zan guebar, at the anchorage, 29A.

After bringing the journal of the Periplus to a con clusion, it will not be foreign to the design of this work if we proceed to examine the Menoothias of Ptolemy. It is opposite to Prasum, but towards the north-east186, that Ptolemy has placed this island, and at the distance of five degrees from the continent; for his Prasum is in longitude 80\u00b0, and his Menoo thias in longitude 85\u00b0. His latitude oFPrasum is 15\u00b0 30' south187, his latitude of Menoothias is 12\u00b0 30' 0\". It is from this latitude of 15\u00b0 SO' south, that the early Portuguese universally assume Mosambique for Prasum ; and if it were so, the Menoothias, five degrees to the east, can be nothing but Madagascar. Now it is not necessary to assert that either of these assumptions is correct ; but, true or false, it is evident that the Menoothias of Ptolemy is different from that of the Periplus. The one is op posite to Prasum, in 12\u00b0 30' south; the other is north of Rhaptum, and is in 9\u00b0 south. The one is five degrees, the other is only thirty miles from the continent. Where Prasum is to be placed is an object worthy of inquiry, if there were data sufficient to determine it, as it is the final limit of ancient discovery to the south. I can point out no fitter position for it than Mosambique ; and if the Greeks did reach that port, they must probably have heard of the great island.

Nothing 30' is more easy than to affirm the accomplishment of these great attempts, where an author clogs himself with neither circumstances or particulars ; but whenever we obtain these, as we do in the journal of Nearchus or the Periplus, we find in- deed that the ancients performed great things with slender means; but we see plainly also what they could not do. We see, with such vessels as they had, they could neither have got round the Cape of Good Hope, by adhering to the coast, where the violence of the ocean must have been insupportable, nor could they have avoided this by standing out to sea, as they had neither the means nor the knowledge to regain the shore if they had lost sight of it for a single week.

In asserting this, if I de tract from the authority of Herodotus, Diodorus, Ptolemy, Juba, and Pliny, it is a detraction consistent with the most perfect veneration of those great and illustrious authors, for they have all followed the reports of others, while the author of the Periplus and Hanno speak from their own experience. It is from reports of others that we hear of a Cerne, and a Southern Horn, on both sides of this vast continent. These names were, in the respective ages the ne plus ultra of know ledge on both sides ; and whoever sailed, either from the Red Sea, or the Mediterranean, arrived at these points, as Colum bus arrived at the Indies by taking a course directly opposite to Gama. The Southern Horn of Ptolemy, on the eastern coast, is in latitude 4\u00b0 50' 0\" north, and the extreme point of Africa 3\u00b08, is nearly in 35\u00b0 south, making more than thirty-nine degrees difference ; the Southern Horn of Hanno, on the western coast, is in latitude 7\u00b0 north, making two-and-forty degrees from the same extremity ; but if we take both together, reckoning eighty-one degrees from one Southern Horn to the other, this is a space that Pliny reduces as it were to a point, and considers the junction of the Atlantick Oeean, as taking plaee almost instantly ; Juba takes a much bolder flight, and reckons the commencement of the Atlantick Ocean from the Bay of Mosyllon, annihilating by this method, if it were pos sible, the immense triangle of this vast continent30', and bring ing his own Mauritania almost in contact with Arabia.

And this supposition of the possibility produced the belief of the performance. Pliny is self-evidently chargeable with this misconception, and Herodotus had probably no means of information by which be. could form a judgment of the ex tent of Africa to the south. It is on this ground above all others that we may assert, that the author of the Periplus visited Rhapta in person ; he had not heard of Prasum, a proof that the account of it is posterior to his age ; he takes no notice of the circumnavigation ever having been accomplished, a proof that he knew nothing of Hero dotus, or did not believe his report, although at the same time he admits the junction of the two oceans as a fact. He says nothing of Cerne, which is a proof that the mistake attending it, commenced from the Mediterranean and not from the Red Sea. That the general tendency of the coast was south-west he saw, as far as he went; and that it continued so, he might collect from the natives or the Arabs ; or he might conclude the union of this sea with the Atlantick, from considering that converging lines must meet. But whatever source of intelli gence he had, that he should mix nothing marvellous or extra vagant with the termination, is a merit that few of the ancient geographers have to boast.

This is the more remarkable as the account of Her6 dotus has strongly the semblance of truth, while Hanno and Eudoxus never pretended to the honour of the achievement themselves, nor was it ever imputed to them by any one who was acquainted with their real history, their situation, object, or designs. It is with great reluctance that I controvert the testimony of Herodotus, for it is no light offence to question historical facts upon evidence of mere speculation. It must be confessed like wise, that the facts he gives us of this voyage, though few, are consistent. The shadow falling to the south, the delay of stop ping to sow grain and reap an harvest3'6, and the space of three years employed in the circumnavigation, joined with the simplicity of the narrative, are all points so strong and con vincing, that if they are insisted upon by those who believe the possibility of effecting the passage by the ancients, no argu ments to the contrary, however founded upon a different opinion, can leave the mind without a doubt upon the ques tion. That different opinion I confess is mine, but I wish to state it with all deference to the Father of History, and with the profession that I am still open to conviction, whenever the weight of evidence shall preponderate against the reasons I have to offer. I allow with Montesquieu, that the attempt commenced from the eastern side of the continent, presents a much greater voyage of Nearchus, that he makes him ter- See Bruce, vol. i. p. 456, and p. 470. quarto minate his expedition in the sea of Suez.

But if this was so far in their favour, still about Cape Verde both the wind318 and current would become directly ad verse; and if they could not sail, was it possible to conduct a fleet by rowing round such promontories as Cape Verde, Cape Blanco, and Cape Boyador ? The fatigue, the danger of the seas, the necessity of landing for provisions, water, and relaxa tion, the disposition of the natives, and the obstruction of the current for almost 20\u00b0, present such an accumulation of difficulties, that success in a first attempt must be deemed in credible. That the Portuguese surmounted all this, and more, is true; but they proceeded with the compass and astrolabe; they could quit the coast at pleasure; they did not row, but sail ; they could tack if the wind were adverse : and yet with all these advantages, and much better vessels, it was only by the experience of successive voyages, and the perseverance of a century, that they at last accomplished what the Ph\u0153nicians performed in three years, and at the first attempt.

The latter means of safety could not have been adopted by the Ph\u0153nicians, they could not stand out to sea ; and if they adhered to the coast, by all that we can now judge from the construction of ajicient vessels, shipwreck must have been inevitable. But to omit these considerations for the present, let us ob serve, in the first place, that the actual performance of this voyage stands upon a single testimony, and of all the circum navigations affirmed, this is the only one which will bear an argument. If it took place in the reign of Neko, Herodotus lived an hundred and sixty years after the fact321, and received the account from the Egyptians. That Her6dotus did receive the account, must be indubitably admitted. His general vera city is a sufficient voucher. But that the Egyptians deceived him is an imputation which he does not scruple to instance in some other 322 particulars, and of which we have the most un doubted evidence at this day. If we take the date of Neko's reign in 604, A.C. 323, and allow that he was a sovereign at tached to commerce, (as appears by his attempt to make a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea,) it will be readily granted that he must be acquainted with the navigation of that sea, and 310 In attempting which, several ships have fallen in with the Ice Islands so graphically described by the illustrious Cook. srav-ra toy Xoyov VTtjKttTXt ot* t\u00ab \"Kiycjxiva viz lnas-Ti'V axosT, yqaQw.

The Egyptians had probably the least share in this, but the trade itself is to all appearance as old as Thebes, and the cause of its splendour and aggrandizement. That it was prosecuted by Solomon324, Hiram, and Jehosaphat we know historically ; and that it was enjoyed in all ages by the Arabians in some form or other, there is every reason to believe from the commodities found in Egypt, Palestine, and Europe. These causes, and the testimony which Agath&rchides bears, that the gold mines on the coast of the Red Sea were wrought by the native kings of Egypt, prove that Neko might wish to extend his knowledge down the coast of Africa to its termination, and that he might consequently send a Ph\u0153nician fleet to the south ward for that purpose. But that they executed their commis sion is not so readily to be admitted. Had this fleet no diffi culties to encounter, because we read of none but the want of provisions ? Can we suppose the Ph\u0153nicians so superior to the Greeks in the art325 of navigation, as to have no dread of pass ing the greatest promontory in the world, when Nearchus and his officers shuddered at Mussendon, and dare not attempt Ras-el-had ?

Raise them as we please above Greeks, Romans, and Arabians in science, they were doubtless inferior in courage to them all/ And whatever science we allot them, the smallest bark could have been conducted by the know- ledge 327 of a Portuguese pilot in greater safety, than the largest vessel ever fitted out of Egypt. Some admirers of the ancients, not content with supposing the execution of such a voyage, are willing to give them the means, by furnishing them with the compass, and other nautical instruments ; these, it is said, were found in the possession of the Arabians, at the time the Por- tuguese first came into the Indian Ocean, and that they were afterwards met with in India and in China. The fact is true, but this was in the latter end of the fifteenth century, and the compass is said to have been known in Europe early in the thirteenth 32S ; it had therefore passed from Italy into Egypt, and from Egypt to the Red Sea. But this argument, if it could be supported, would effectually contradict the hypothesis it is brought to support ; for it would prove, that the Arabians of Mosambique, who really possessed these instruments, had never been enabled by them, nor ever dared, to pass southward of Corrientes in their neighbourhood, while the Ph\u0153nicians had 3,6 See the ordinary danger of the Cape he had a trade-wind all the way in his favour, without storm.

Now, if the Ph\u0153nicians had not the compass, how could they perform what was with difficulty performed by it ? If they had it, how hap pened they to perform so much more by it in an early age than the Arabians in a later ? But this question 329 has been set at rest by Niebuhr, Mickle, and Sir William Jones, who shew that the Arabian 33\u00b0 and Indian compass is formed from that of Europe. But let us now examine the text of Herodotus. The nar rative of this voyage is introduced in a passage where he is giving the limits and extent of the three continents, and here he says, that Neko proved Africa to be surrounded by the ocean from the completion of this voyage. One expects, however, to hear of the officer who commanded ; it was at least as great an ex ploit as any which the fabulous navigators had achieved. Se sonchosis, the Oriental Bacchus, and Hercules, whatever mio-ht be the extent of their victories, peregrinations, or voyages, fell far short of this, and they were immortalised ; while among the Greeks, Jason, who sailed little more than seven hundred miles, was himself worshipped as a hero, and had his ship translated to the sphere. How happened it then that the greatest dis covery,which the world admits, should confer no honour on the discoverer ? The name of-Sataspes still lives in the same pao-e of Herodotus, whom Xerxes put to death because he attempted 35 ' See Renaudot upon Bergeron. Two 1120 years before the Christian sera- and Arabs.

The great argument333 against both is the total failure of all consequences whatsoever, the total want of all collateral evidence, and the total silence of all other historians but those who have copied from Herodotus.

This argument, indeed, is not to be insisted on, nor the oblivion to which the name of the commander is consigned, but the difficulties of the voyage itself, the want of means to sur mount them, the failure of consequences, and the silence of other historians, are objections not to be set aside with out stronger evidence on the other side than has yet been produced. But as it is not in our power to prove a negative, let us now examine the positive testimony of other authors in opposition to that of Herodotus. The author of the Periplus says directly, that the ocean never was explored on the eastern side to the point of Africa.

And Ptolemy is so far from be lieving the report of Neko or the Egyptians, that he not only supposes the voyage never performed, but renders it impos sible ; that is, he brings round the continent of Africa unbroken with a sweep to the east, till he makes it join the continent of Asia to the eastward of the Golden Chersonese. False as this hypothesis may be, it is still a contradiction di rect to Herodotus ; for though it proves that Ptolemy was himself ignorant of every thing beyond Prasum, it proves likewise that he believed all pretensions to a progress farther south fabulous ; and that where all knowledge ceased he had a right to an hv pothesis of his own as well as others. D'Anville supposes that Ptolemy assumed this system from the prevailing idea among the ancients, that there ought to be Antipodes in the south, correspondent to those of the northern hemisphere. Perhaps also a counterbalance of continents was as favourite a notion in the early ages as in the modern.

In collecting these opinions of Ptolemy, Strabo, Polybius, Skulax, Purchas, Gossellin, Robertson, and d'Anville, I feel myself supported by the greatest authorities ancient and modern.

It has been already shewn by the table, that there is a general correspondence between Ptolemy and the Peripl&s, and their disagreement in particulars is not imputable to the authors themselves, but to the age they lived in. In that age the geographer did not navigate, and the navigator had no science341. The geographer calculated by degrees without ob- servation 342 ; the navigator reckoned by his day's course. Mo- dern navigators correct their dead reckoning by observation ; but in the early ages science and practice had little connection : and yet so far from there being any charge of error or negli- gence in this, that it is exactly the reverse. We are not to condemn the mistakes of Ptolemy in longitude or latitude, but to revere the science, which applied the phenomena of the heavens to the measurement of the earth. The navigator of the present hour is conducted on principles first established by Ptolemy. The errors of his maps can no longer mislead, while his principle must be of the same duration as navigation itself. 1 call the principle Ptolemy's, because he fixed it and brought it into use. Thales and Anaxagoras knew that the world was 341 Every seaman knows that his dead that he had no accounts to be depended on, reckoning amounts to\" nothing till it is cor- ivx (Wn; $\\ raairnij ij-ojfaf, and therefore col. rected by observation. lected his latitudes from similar Deductions in. >\u2022' Ftoleiuy, lib. i. c. 9. tJls us expressly the opposite hemisphere: 3"], [242, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 206 a sphere. Eratosthenes drew the first parallel of latitude at Rhodes, and first measured a degree of a great circle upon the earth ; Hipparchus taught that the measurement of the heavens was applicable to the earth. And Dioscorus and Marinus 343 are both said by Ptolemy to have delineated maps on principles similar to his own; though we may judge what these were, when he says that Marinus had the latitude of some places and the longitude of others, but scarcely one position where he could ascertain both. But if Ptolemy objects, to the method of Marinus, we are compelled to object to the method Ptolemy used to correct it ; for he says, that in going down the coast of Africa, Marinus reckoned by the days' course of the voyagers, and finding these carried Prasum to 35\u00b0 south, he shortened the estimate, and placed that promontory under the tropick of Capricorn. He then enters into a long argument to prove the insufficiency of this standard, and forms another for himself, by considering the productions of nature as similar, at equal dis tances, on both sides the equator ; a standard certainly not less vague; and yet on this ground, and no other, he fixes Prasum in latitude 15\u00b0 30' south. Now there is a very remark able coincidence attends the conclusion of both these geo graphers ; for the Prasum of Ptolemy is precisely at Mosam bique, and that of Marinus at Cape Corrientes ; and it is still more extraordinary that Mosambique should be the last344 of 343 Marinus is to Ptolemy what Eratosthenes is to Strabo ; both of them the best writers previous to their own inquiries, and therefore in correcting the best of their predecessors, both Strabo and Ptolemy mean to conclude ail inferior geographers. Marinus was a Tynan, and if his work had been preserved, must have been of great service ; for he had examined the history of preceding ages, and all the in formation of hi; own time ; comparing and rectifying them as he proceeded in hi3 own ac count. Ptol. lib. i. c, 6. 3,4 There were Arabs lower down at Sofala, but Mosambique may well be styled the last of their colonies."], [243, "AZANIA 207 the Arabian settlements in the following ages, and Corrientes the limit of their knowledge. From all the evidence I can collect, and all the circumstances I can combine, I find it impossible to ascertain the site of Prasum 34S ; but I have no hesitation in carrying it farther to the south than d'Anville does, or in fixing Corrientes as the farthest possible boundary to all the knowledge of the ancients. The detail of Ptolemy goes to Rhaptum, and no farther ; so far he had journals, and the relation of navigators to conduct him; beyond that, the voyage did not in its regular course extend ; and if single vessels had at any time been carried to Prasum, by the winds and currents, it was accidental. But it should seem that it was heard of from the natives, or the Arabs, rather than seen, as all circumstances and particulars end with Rhaptum ; and the remainder consists of a single step to Prasum, that is, near seven degrees, without mention of a port, an anchorage, or a single feature of the coast. One thing, however, is certain, that the name of Prasum is familiar to Marinus, who is prior to Ptolemy, and is not known to the author of the Periplus. If, therefore, Ptolemy lived in the reign of Adrian, and we have an intervening writer between him and our author, we cannot err more than a very few years in assigning the date of the Periplus to the latter end of the reign of Claudius, or the beginning of that of Nero. There is 345 There are some coincidences so extraor- this, their difference is still irreconcilable ; for dinary, and some contradictions so strong, Marinus's Prasum is in 230 south, and Pto that the choice is wholly at a stand.

Another circumstance highly worthy of attention is the argu ment of Ptolemy351, to invalidate the estimate of a day's course.

From these facts357 Ptolemy argues, that as fne-and-twenty days are attributed to the shorter course, and twenty to the longer, there can be no stated measure of a day's course to be depended on. I must own that to my conception they prove exactly the contrary ; for though a day's course is certainly in- 353 It may be proper to examine the mon soon upon this question. d'Anville still preserves Ptolemy's sources of the White River in his map, and Rennell does not discard them. The lakes of those sources are placed in 6\u00b0 north by d'Anville, and in a very different longitude from Ptolemy's, while this lake of Ptolemy's is in io\u00b0 south. And here d'Anville has a lake also, but of which he speaks with yieat uncertainty. See Ptol. lib. i. c. 9. But Ptolemy, in the 17th chapter, ex pressly states that this lake is not near the coast but far inland. D'Anville's earliest notice of this lake, called Maravi, is in a map which he composed for Le Grande's transla tion of Lobo, in 1728. 3S4 That there is a great lake inland from the coast of Ajan, is a report of which we find traces in almost all the acounts ancient or modern ; but where to fix it, or what it is, seems by no means ascertained. D'An ville notices such a lake on his map of Africa, and conjectures that it may be the source of the Obii, which issues at Ampaga and Pate. Ptolemy here makes it the origin of the Nile, and places it in io\u00b0 south*, and the Nubian geographer carries to 16\u00ae, which is the lati tude of the Lake Maravi, while the source that Bruce visited is in 12\u00b0 north. Two-and twenty degrees is surely too great a difference to suppose between the head of the White and the Blue River : neither is it probable that any source of the Nile should be south of the moi-.ntains of Abyssinia, which Rennell now says are part of the great Btlt that di vides Africa ; this indeed is not impossible, as the Indus and the Ganges both cut the great Belt of Asia ; but it is highly improbable, on account of the vast space between.

The difference itself of twenty-five and twenty days is not so great as to insist upon with severity, and we must likewise add, that both voyages seem in consequence of surprize, and not the ordinary course 'of the navigation. Mariners do not now, and certainly could not formerly, reckon by an individual, but a general run ; and when they are in the sweep of the trade winds or the monsoons, though the force of the wind is not perfectly or constantly equal, it is so generally subject to cal culation, as to vary but a few days in very extensive passages. This sort of estimate al! seamen have in such voyages, and on such coasts as they frequent. And those who know how nearly the computation of seamen approaches to the truth, will cer tainly allow more precision in the accounts of Marinus and the Pcriplfts before us, than Ptolemy is willing to concede. On this point we have a most remarkable coincidence to notice; for as Marinus states the passage of Diogenes from Ardmata3*1 to the lakes at five-and-twenty days, the Periplus assigns ex actly the same number from Opone 361 to Rhaptum upon a dis tance as nearly equal as possible. The conclusion from this is 358 He was carried away by. the Aparktias, we should add the six days specified, lib. i. that is, the north-east monsoon. c.17. the amount in PtiLmy would be 3\u00bb From Gardafui to Melinda or Pate. twenty-four days, not very different from that 360 The day's course from Aromata to of Theophilus Diogenes, or the Periplus.

But, from his rejection of the estimate, we may proceed to his contradiction of the facts ; for in his seventeenth chabter he controverts the whole account of Marinus X, and as far as we can collect, his account was in union with the Peripliis. The reasons for admitting the statement of the Periplus are contained in the whole of the preceding pages. The reason for doubting Ptolemy is, that his account is not consistent with his own detail of the coast 3% nor consonant to the knowledge of it, which we have at present. He sets out with saying, that the merchants who trade between Arabia Felix and Aromata, Azauia, and Rhapta, give a different statement from that of Marinus. They mention that the course from Ardmata to Rhaptum is south-west; but from Rhapta to Prasum south-east. This indeed would hold good for a small bend of the coast, but upon the seven degrees which Ptolemy assigns to the interval, it is directly false ; for the general inclination from Gardefan to the Cape of Good Hope is south-west upon the whole ; and this turn which he assumes to the south-east, seems only to prepare it for the curve he gives it all round the Antarctic Ocean. He then adds, that the village Panon is next to Aromata, and that Opone is six days from Panon. If there be not a corruption of 3ft! I had once conceived an opinion that Marinus might be the true author of the Peri plus, from finding his great agreement with it, and that the objections which Ptolemy brings against Marinus\u00abin the seventeenth chapter ap ply very nearly to the Periplus. But I am convinced this opinion cannot be defended, for Marinus was no navigator, but a geographer ; and Marinus knew or had heard of Prasum, which the author of the Periplus certainly had not. 563 Page 112. EE 2"], [248, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 212 the text here, or a great error in our construction of it, this is in direct opposition to his own table as well as the Periplfts. For his table gives only five minutes difference between the latitude of the two. He next mentions Zengisa, Mount Pha langis, and the bay called Apokopa, which it requires two courses of twenty-four hours to pass. Then the Little Coast of three similar courses, and the Great Coast of five; then two more to Essina, one to Serapion, and three more across a bay to Rhapta. Niki, he adds, lies at the commencement of this bay next to Serapion. And last of all he notices a river called Rhaptum, with a city of the same name, the metropolis of Barbaria, with a vast bay which must be passed to reach Prasum, where the sea is very shoal364, and round Prasum is the country of the Anthropophagi. Now the meaning of this language, if 1 understand it right, is, that at Rhaptum is the last settlement of the Arabs, and that Prasum is in the country of the Negroes, for so I interpret Anthrop6phagi. This is not expressed indeed, but is so perfectly consistent with the Peri plus that it can hardly be disputed. The difference that there is between this detail of the coast and that of the Periplus, will be best seen by consulting the table ; but whatever it may be, it contributes more to establish that journal by its general concurrence, than it detracts from it by disagreement in particulars. It appears to me, whether from predilection to my author, I cannot say, that Ptolemy had a journal before him but a worse. I see the correspondence between the two, but more consistence in the Periplus.

The reasoning, therefore, which he builds on this, to correct Marinus, appears of less weight; for we find all the distances of the Periplus correspondent to the actual nature of the coast at present; and whatever failure there may be in the application of it to particulars, the leading characters, such as the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, Ras-Feel, Gardafui, Daffui, Cape Baxas, the Coast of Seven Rivers, and the Zanguebar Islands, are so clear and manifest, that the outline may be con sidered as perfect, whatever error there may be in the filling up. To my own mind the evidence is complete; but every author who compiles from the labours of others, without visit ing the countries of which he treats, must subject the specula tions of the closet to the determination of navigators on the spot. To this law I submit my inquiries most chearfully, soliciting information without fear of the result, and ready to stand corrected by every intelligent officer who will make this work the companion of his voyage. One farther observation is all that remains in this part of my discussion, which is, the pe culiarity that Prasum, signifying Green, should point out a green cape for the termination of ancient knowledge on the eastern side of the vast continent of Africa, while another Green Cape (Cape Ycrd) should have been for some years the boun dary of modern navigation on the western side. If I am not mistaken, Cape Verde has its name from its verdant appearance when first seen by the Portuguese ; otherwise it might have been thought that those who first reached it had annihilated the great triangle like Juba and Pliny, and thought they had ar- 7"], [250, "2i4 PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. rived at the Green Cape 36s of the ancients. This will not ap pear an idle observation to those who are conversant with the ancient geographers, and who know that they found, as already noticed,\u00b0a Western Horn and Cerne366 on both sides the con tinent, and a Thule from the Orkneys to the Pole. But there is another view in mentioning it, which is, that some future navigator, with this clue to direct him, may, when he is going up the Mosambique passage, still' find some characteristick Greenness either in the colour of the sea, or on the continent, which may enable him to point out the Prasum of the ancients. This is a point I am not able to ascertain to my own satisfac tion, but it canriot be farther south than Corrientes, nor farther north than Quiloa or the Zanguebar Islands. English ships generally leave the coast before they are so far north, but acci- dent may carry some curious observer to the spot, which he may recognize, by knowing previously where he is to search, and what he is to search for.

Of the progress of this discovery it will be necessary to trace little more than the dates363. Prince Henry, fifth son of Johh the first, king of Portugal, took up his residence at Sagrez 369, near Cape Saint Vincent, about the year 1406 37\u00b0. The history of his discoveries is familiar to every one, but, like the history of all others who are the favourites of mankind, it is not suffi cient to give him his due merit, which is superlative, but it must be enhanced by hyperbole.

This name points to the acquisition of gold ; and history mentions that the dust of that precious metal was here first offered as a ransom for some of the natives who had been taken prisoners. Upon the. return of these vessels to Portugal377, the sight of gold produced an emo tion much more effectual than all the exhortations of Prince Henry had been able to excite; a company37' was immediately formed at Lagos, and the progress of discovery was ensured whether Henry had lived or died. This is the primary date to which we may refer that turn for adventure which sprung up in Europe, which pervaded all the ardent spirits in every country for the two succeeding centuries ; and which never ceased till it had united the four quarters of the globe in commercial inter course. Henry had stood alone for almost forty years, and had he fallen before these few ounces of gold reached his country, the spirit of discovery might have perished with him, 3'; D'Anville has endeavoured to identify the Canaries with the Fortunate Islands ; and I do not doubt the fact, for these islands were found inhabited : a circumstance arising from their being visible from the continent. 3?s It will appear hereafter that a John Diaz was one of the first partners of this Company, and from him several of the family were employed in the future discoveries, till the time of Bartholomew Diaz, the first cir cumnavigator of Africa, in 1487. Thus was the connexion formed between the discovery of Rio-del-Ouro and the Cape of Goo4 Hope. 37<i That the desire of discovery might be more increased, says Galvan. Purchas, ii.

This cape was likewise doubled, and some pro gress is supposed to have been made as far south as the equator, but Cape Verde, or at farthest Rio Grande, may be considered as the limit of Henry's discoveries. He is deservedly 579 cele brated by all writers as the reviver of navigation, and the great founder of that commerce which has raised the mari time power of Europe above all the other nations in the world. After the death of Henry his designs languished during the reign of Alonzo, but the spirit of adventure was not sup pressed. In 1471 the discoveries extended to Cape Gonzales beyond the equator, and terminated with this reign at Cape Saint Catherine, in latitude 2\u00b0 30' 0\" soutb3So. John the second succeeded to the throne in 1481 ; and revived the pursuits of Henry with all the ardour of their author. In 1484 his fleets reached Congo, and penetrated to 22\u00b0 south. It was in Benin that the first 3Sl account of Abyssinia was received, and nearly about the same time John sent out Bartholomew Diaz with three ships, who first circumnavigated the extreme point of Africa, and dispatched Covilham in search of India by Egypt and the Red Sea. The date of Diaz's expedition is fixed in 1486, nearly eighty years after the commencement of Henry's 379 Mickle xxxix. from Faria, vol. i. p. 21. on the western side of Africa; oh the eastern See his character, p. 18. side, M.

John II. in the beginning of his reign had sent two friars, one of the order of St. Francis, and the other John of Lisbon, with a third who was a layman, into the East384, in order to discover India by land. These travellers went, for want of the Arabick language, no farther than Jerusalem. In the year 1486 or 2487 X he therefore sent John Pedreio de Covilham and Alonso de Pay va on the same service ; and after them two Jews, Abraham of Beja and Joseph of Lamego. As nothing can shew the solicitude of the king more than these circum stances, so nothing can prove his penetration more than this choice of Covilham ; he was a soldier, who had served in Africa ; he had been after that ambassador to Morocco, and had acquired the Arabick language to perfection. In obedience to his sovereign he departed from Lisbon 3SS, and took the route 3'a These dates are of consequence ; because Bruce, vol. ii. p. 108. supposes Diaz to have sailed in consequence of Covilham's intelli gence, which is directly contrary to the testi mony of Faria, Castaneda, Alvarez, and Mickle. When Covilham wrote he certainly did not know of Diaz's success. Petreio. See vol. i. p. 147. 354 Castaneda, p. 2. 3,s I collect that Covilham entered Abys sinia in 1488 from Alvarez in Ramusio ; for Alvarez says he confessed him in 1521, thirty three years after he had entered the country. 3,6 Alvarez in Ramusio, vol. i. p. 191. 2^7. et seq. 31,3 Called de Covilham from the name of his birth place.

He saw the pepper and ginger38', he heard of cloves and cinnamon. After this he returned to the coast of Africa, touched at Zcila, and went down the coast as low as Sofala, the last residence of the Arabs, and the limit of their knowledge in that age, as it had been in the age of the Peripltts. The Arabs of Covilham's age knew indeed that the sea was navigable to the south-west, as their earlier countrymen did when the author of the Peripltts was in the country, but they knew not where it ended.

Covilham was not to receive the reward of his services ; one part of his commission he had not executed, which was, to visit Ab}rssinia; he returned, therefore, from Cairo to Ormuz, and from Ormuz once more to Aden, where he waited till he found the means of obtaining admission into Abyssinia. Here he was received with kindness, but hence he was never to return : for in Abyssinia he was found by Alvarez392 the almoner to the em- bassy of John de Lima, in 1525, who observes that the king had procured him a wife and assigned him lands, and that he was beloved by the people as much as by the sovereign. All this, however, had not reconciled him to the country. He solicited John de Lima, and John interceded with the king to suffer him to return with the embassy, but all his solicitations were in vain. I dwell with a melancholy pleasure on the his- tory of this man, (whom Alvarez describes still as a brave soldier and a devout Christian,) when I reflect upon what must have been his sentiments on hearing the success of his countrymen, in consequence of the discovery to which he so essentially con tributed. They were sovereigns of the ocean from the Cape of Good Hope to the Straits of Malacca ; lie was still a prisoner in a country of Barbarians. There is a circumstance attached to the history of Covilham of great geographical importance, which is the map or chart 35\" The whole of this is confirmed by de of Abyssinia, Barros. Dec. i.

This map was put into Covilham's hands, with orders to make his way, if possible, into Abyssinia, and discover whether there was a passage round. the extremity of Africa, which the framers of this map asserted to be practicable, on the authority of some obscure information which they had collected. To the two Jews, Rodriguez and Moses, or Joseph, who composed this map, Mickle imputes the invention of the astro labe ; but perhaps the word astrolabe misled him, the primary meaning of which was an armillary sphere. Ptolemy reduced this to a planisphere ; and yet the name of astrolabe continued till it became applied to maps like his in stereographick projec tion. The sea astrolabe is a diffeient instrument, for taking the altitude of the sun, stars, &q. it is a ring with a moveable index. (See Chambers's Dictionary in voce.) This last sort of astrolabe is described in Chaucer's treatise on this subject, which bears date 1391 : so that if Mickle means this instru ment, it could be no invention of the Jewish doctors394; and that he does mean it, I refer to his own words 39S. I' have not di Barros's work at present, but in Alvarez39* I find the men tion of the map composed by Castadilia and the two Jews.

The name of Regiomontanus was Muller, who took his Latin title from Koningshoven, according to the fashion of the day. He was born in 1436, and pub lished the Almagest of Ptolemy, dying in 1476. M. de Mure doubts whether Behaim was a disciple of Muller's. The Ger mans of that day were the best mathematicians in Europe. The astrolabe, as used in the voyage of Magellan, is described by Pigafetta in his treatise on navigation, inserted in Amoretti's edition, with a drawing of the instrument. The obscure information obtained by Castadilia and his associates was possibly derived from the celebrated map of Venice, drawn up for Prince Henry, in the year 1459, by Fra. Mauro of St. Michael di Murano. This map does exhibit a southern termination of Africa, the knowledge of which was derived from the report of an Indian navigator who had passed it from the east, and is the same as that mentioned by Mickle398 from Galvan, found by Don Ferdinand, in 1526, in the monas tery of Alcobaza, where it is said to be still preserved. Records of this sort, it is well known, were deposited in the custpdy of Prince Henry and the kings of Portugal ; and from these, instructions were given with great secrecy to officers ap pointed to command in the prosecution of discovery. Such was the information that Magellan is said to have received from a chart in the king's own possession, drawn up by Martin Be\u2014 3,3 P. xxxiv. Introduction."], [260, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 224 haim, in which the straits were laid down that Magellan after wards explored. For this information he carried with him when he withdrew into Spain, on the credit of which he ob tained the protection of Cardinal Ximenes, and the command of that fleet which first circumnavigated the world. How Martin Behaim became possessed of this knowledge is a question upon which the geographers are not agreed ; some thinking it a vain pretension set up to detract from the glory of Magellan, and others contending for the real existence of such a chart in the secret repository of the kings of Portugal. Dr. Robertson and M. de Murr399 have adopted the former opinion, and found it on the delineation contained in the Nuremberg globe formed by M. Behaim, on which there is no thing between the Azores and Japan but the two fabulous islands of Antilia and St. Brandon. M. Otto supports the claim of M. Behaim in a memoir transmitted to the Philosophical Society at Philadelphia ; and M. Charles Amoretti, who has published the voyage of Ma gellan from the journal of Pigafetta preserved in the Ambrosian Library at Milan, maintains the same opinion, grounded on the authority of Pigafetta himself, who sailed under Magellan in this expedition. The passage occurs at the fortieth page of the French transla tion, nearly in the following words : \" The sentiments of every \" person in the fleet [after reaching the eastern entrance of \" the strait] were, that it had no issue on the west ; and no ? thing but the confidence they had in the superior information 399 The memoir of M. de Murr is subjoined to the voyage of Pigafetta, published by Charles Amoretti of Milan, Paris, 1803."], [261, "AZANIA. 225 \" of the commander could have induced them to prosecute the \" research. But this great man, as skilful as he was coura \" geous, knew that he was to seek for a passage through an \" obscure strait : this strait he had seen laid down in a chart40* \" of Martin de Boheme, a most excellent cosmographer, which \" was in the possession of the king of Portugal.\" On this single passage the whole claim of M. Behaim rests finally for support ; for Behaim himself has left no testimony of his discovery, either on his globe, or in the archives of Nuremberg, or in his numerous letters which are still preserved. He does not appear to be the discoverer of the Azores, as he is supposed to be by many writers, but to have married the daughter of Job de Heurter^ a Fleming, who carried a colony of his countrymen to those islands. The Azores were discovered in 1431 ; Behaim was born in 1430. It is true that he resided many years at Fayal ; and it is reported that he made a voyage with James Cano in 1483, beyond the equator, which is cajled entering into another world, and is said to have been prose cuted during more than two years. But the direction of their course was to the east, to Ethiopia as it is called, that is, to into such a work, before that continent was dreamed of, is unaccountable. Galvan adds, that Don Henry was much assisted by it. But even at that early period, I think, Prince Henry had much better intelligence. 4\u00b0\u00b0 According to Gaivan in Purchas, ii. p. 1673. Don Pedro brought home from Venice, as early as 1428, a map which con tained both the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits of Magellan ; but it proves too much, for it says the Straits of Magellan were called the Dragon's Tail, and the Cape of Good Hope was entitled the Fore Front of Africa. This is a different map from that of Fra. Mauro, not only by its date, but because the chart in the monastery of Alcobaza is men tioned afterwards. If there were fictitious maps of this sort, Behaim might have seen one ; but how America should find its way M. de Murr (p. 351. of his Dissertation on M. Behaim, published by Amoretti) main tains that the two passages attributed to Sche del, 1493, are interpolations. These passages assert the voyage of Behaim with Cano ; but in the MS. of Schedel's Chronicle, they are written in a different hand. M. de Murr con cludes that there is no other evidence of Be haim's performing this voyage. VOL. II. G G"], [262, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 226 Congo ; and the cargo they brought home proves it, for it was an inferior kind of pepper, an article certainly never found in the neighbourhood of the Straits of Magellan. Neither is it possible, if Behaim did accompany Cano, that he should have touched upon America; for the date of his globe is 1492, and it contains nothing west of St. Brandon. But in answer to this Amoretti contends, that though it ap pears from his globe that he knew nothing of America in 1492, it does not follow that he did not acquire a knowledge both of America and the strait which joined the Atlantick to the Pacifick Ocean, in the interval between 1492 and 1506, which is the date of his death. This is a bold supposition, where the assumed author of the discovery has left no such testimony of himself: a discovery second only, and perhaps equal, to the circumnavigation of Africa. Still the declaration of Pigafetta is precise, and is entitled to great respect. But if we refer to dates, it is possible that another clue may be found to develope this mystery. Colum bus reached America in 1492, which is the exact date of the Nuremberg globe. M. Behaim, therefore, cannot claim any share in his laurels : his own voyage beyond the equator was in 1483, 1484, and directed to the east; he therefore did not discover a western continent in that expedition. Diaz passed the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 ; Gama in December 1497- Pinzon reached the River of Amazons in 1500, and the same year Brazil was first seen by Cabral. Vcspucius Americus dis covered the Terra Firma of South America in 1502. Now all these great discoveries, except that of Diaz, fall between the date of the Nuremberg globe, 1492, and the death of Behaim in 1506; and as he was the greatest cosmographer of his age, it"], [263, "AZANIA, 227 is a supposition much better founded than that of Amoretti, that if M. Behaim made any chart of the new discoveries to the south-west, he might rationally conjecture a passage round the southern point of America, conformable to that round the southern termination of Africa. That a chart of this sort might be in possession of the king of Portugal, and that Magellan40' might have seen it, is highly probable ; but doubtless the pas sage was laid down from conjecture, as is evident from Piga fetta ; for he says, Magellan was determined to prosecute his search after it to latitude 75\u00b0 4\u00b0\\ had he not found it in 52\u00b0. Here, therefore, is an uncertainty of twenty-three degrees, and the existence of the Strait, he adds, was (molto ascoso) very obscure, or much concealed. Now these circumstances could not have existed if Behaim had visited the southern part of America himself; for he was an excellent cosmographer; he was the corrector of the astro labe403, and was as capable of determining a latitude as any of the Portuguese navigators. Had he, therefore, discovered this Strait himself, he never could have left it in any chart he drew, with an uncertainty of twenty-three degrees. But he resided at Fa)al from 1493 to 1506, when he returned to Lisbon, where he died. It is very possible that he then brought with him the chart that he gave to the king of Portugal, for Fayal lay in the track of the navigators who went to the south-west on dis- 401 All those entrusted with commands, or dentially imparted to him ; and this secret he sent on expeditions, by the kings of Portugal, conveyed to the king of Spain. were furnished with instructions from the col- 4m Pigafetta, p. 46.

This supposition admits not of proof, but is rational and consistent : it reconciles the testimony of Pigafetta, and shews us how much men of enterprise are indebted to men of science and contemplation. Martin Behaim is not a man to be compared to Prince Madoc, or those bold pretenders who claimed the discovery of a north-east or north-west passage to the East Indies. He has himself never assumed any pretensions to the discredit of Ma gellan ; and if he did frame a chart for the king of Portugal of this sort, he is entitled to much praise for the sagacity of his conjecture, which detracts nothing from the glory of Magellan, but adds to his merit, as having the courage and perseverance to verify the fact by the test of experiment. The map of Fra. Mauro and the letter of Covilham both in fluenced the success of Diaz and Gama ; but who ever thought it derogatory to their honour, that they proceeded to their dis covery upon previous information ? The union of theory and practice is the most solid foundation of all great achievements ; and though it is true that more honour will accrue to the per former of great exploits than to the theorist who matured the plaiij it is injurious to detract from their respective merits. The victories of Philip and Alexander receive no diminution of their splendour, by referring the constitution of their armies to the tacticks of Epaminondas. I have been led into this disquisition (no otherwise connected with my subject than as it opened another communication with"], [265, "AZANIA. 229 India), in order to shew the extreme solicitude of the Court of Portugal in collecting information and concerting measures for the prosecution of discover}' : an attention continued for a whole century, and an object attained at last by surmounting a variety of difficulties, none of which occurred to the Ph\u0153 nicians of Neko. It was in conformity to the same principle that Prince Henry obtained the map of Fra. Mauro from Venice, and other docu ments in the sole possession of the government. From these the instructions ** imparted to travellers and navigators were drawn up by the bishop of Viseo and the two doctors, Rodri gues jand Moses 40s, with great secrecy. A map of this sort was committed to Covilham, when he was dispatched into the East and to Abyssinia ; and Covilham is said by Bruce to have sent home from Cairo a map, which he had obtained from a Moor4\"6 in India, in which the extreme cape of Africa was delineated. That the obtaining such a source of information made part of Covilham's instructions cannot be doubted ; but when Bruce adds, that this map contained not only such a cape, but all the cities round the coast exactly represented, it throws a doubt upon the whole ; for cities407 round the coast there are none for 456 What sort of charts or maps the Arabs had, as late as 1400, may be seen by the map of the world which I have inserted from Al Edrissi in the Appendix. It is true that Africa has a termination in that map, but it is in the longitude of China, that is, it ends in the Mare Tenebrosum, as every\" continent must, for that sea surrounded the world. 404 In the instructions given to Covilham it was directed, di passare un di loro ncll' Ethi opia a vedere il paese del Prete Janni, et se ne i suoi mari fusse notitia alcuna che si posse passare ne mari de ponente perche li detti Dot tore diceveno haverne trovata non so che me moria.

That fictitious charts of this sort existed among the Mahomedans in the East, as well as in Europe, may be ad mitted ; for it was a prevailing notion, in all ages, that Africa was circumnavigable ; and it has been already noticed, that on both coasts, when the voyagers reached the limit of discovery, the report403 of the country was always in favour40' of such a passage. The Portuguese, when they first entered Benomo tapa, heard of great and regular cities in that kingdom, and of public roads running410 far west, and quite down to the Cape. If these reports were exaggerated, we may still conceive that a great kingdom had extended its communications to the west and south, as far as their caravans could find purchasers of the native produce ; and the ruins of great buildings fully authenti cated, with the name of Afur, and the gold mines, have in duced Dos Santos4\" and other writers, as well as Bruce, to place here the O.phir of Scripture, and the limits of the naviga tion from Eziongeber.

But this Mickle considers as a mere report, calculated to derogate from the honour of Prince Henry as the author of the discovery. This, however, the date of the map, whefi it was found in 1526, could not affect, if it were a forgery. But in reality this is nothing more than the map of Fra. Mauro in 1459, a copy of which is said still to be preserved in the monastery of Alcobaza, and the original of which is still at Venice. The history attending it will be found in the fourth Dissertation, added to the second part of this work. Ramusio414 was mistaken in saying that this map was copied from that of Marco Polo's, for it certainly does contain a ter mination of Africa, given on the authority of an Indian pilot; and detracts no more from the merit of Diaz and Gama, than Martin Behaim's account derogates from the honour of Ma gellan. Marco Polo himself was too wise and too faithful a traveller to assert the existence of a cape which was still undiscovered. We have his work, and we find his language in perfect harmony with that of Skulax and the Periplus415. \"Beyond the islands \" of Madastar and Zanzibar,\" says he, \" there is no farther ** navigation southward, because the sea runs there with great 4,3 See Renaudot, Two Arabians, p. 31.

Polo 4l6 himself confesses that his information, in regard to the islands of the Indian Ocean, was obtained from the native pilots and mariners ; and this is the reason why he calls the continent of Africa the island of Zanzibar, and gives it an ex tent of two thousand miles. Whatever error there may be in this, his mention of the current between Madagascar and the continent is an illustrious truth, the more remarkable as M. Polo was never on this coast himself, but the source of his in formation was genuine and authentic. The reason also assigned for not passing to the south, though it was known that there were [lands or] islands in that quarter, is the same which the Arabs of Sofala and Mosambique gave to the Portuguese at their first arrival on the coast. The whole of this is consistent with the received opinions of the Greeks and Arabs, whose knowledge in the early ages terminated at Prasum ; and the current of the Mosambique channel appears to have been an insuperable barrier to all navigators except the Ph\u0153nicians. The travels of M. Polo were a work that had evidently been consulted by Prince Henry and the kings of Portugal ; and the first edition of it from the press was at Lisbon, and as early as 1502, only four years after the voyage of Gama. But the use that had been previously made of it is manifest from the instructions given to Covilham, which were derived from this and other journals 4IT of the same kind, in which the countries he was directed to visit were all noticed.

Ijt was from the Latin copy at Padua that Ramusio published it in Italian, and from which it was inserted in Purchas's collection, and a variety of others on the continent. The best edition is said to be that of Andre Muller4'8 at Berlin, 1671 ; but this I have never been able to obtain. The Portuguese edition of 1502 was published by a gentleman of the court, attendant on Eleonora queen of Emanuel, who likewise published the journal of Nicolai de Conti, and of Jerom de St. Etienne. The date in 1502 seems to intimate that, whatever use had been made of these works in the progress of discovery, they were now pub lished with an intention to prove that they, none of them, con tained a specific account of the great promontory of Africa, and consequently that the merit of the discovery was the pro perty of Gama alone. The belief that such a termination of this vast continent existed, 1 have already shewn, was general ; but the actual de lineation of it, and the assertion that the barrier had been passed, as far as I can discover, to be found nowhere but in the Planisphere of Fra. Mauro. The date of that work is 1459, nearly forty years before Gama sailed ; and it is not only ascertained that Prince Henry had a copy of it, but that it was composed with a view to encourage the great designs which he had in view. There can be no doubt but that both Diaz 4\" See Green in Astley's Collection, vol. iV. p. 581. and the preface of Muller prefixed to M. Polo in Bergeron. VOL. II.

This detracts nothing from the glory of the achievement, but proves the wisdom as well as the solicitude of Prince Henry.; and that while he aspired to the honour of opening the com munication, he neglected no means of acquiring the necessary information requisite to the success of his undertaking. Pos sessed of such instructions, Gama embarked with confidence, and persevered with fortitude. It is presumption to attempt impossibilities, and temerity insures disappointment ; but in Gama we find a selection of means proportioned to the end, and an acquisition of intelligence as the foundation of his hopes. He was not the first man who said that Africa had its limit, but the first that proved it. VOYAGES OF BARTHOLOMEW DIAZ AND VASCO DE GAMA. XXVII. From the year 1410 4'9 to 1486 the Portuguese had been engaged in advancing their discoveries to the south ; some progress had been made in every reign ; but the honour of doubling the extreme cape of Africa was reserved for John the Second.

This however was not the termination of his discovery, for he proceeded to the river del Infante, upwards of six degrees to the eastward of Agulhas4\", which is the most southern point of Africa, and near a degree beyond the Cape of Good Hope. The reason of his return is not quite evident ; but he had parted 4n with one of his little fleet on his passage, and it may be presumed that the impossibility of collecting information from the natives, with the continuance of the coast to the east ward, which he might have expected to trend to the north, contributed to his determination. Five-and-twenty leagues short of this river he erected his cross on a rocky islot, which still bears the name of De la Cruz, in the bay of Algoa424.

Still, though the discovery was made, it was not completed. India had been the object of the sovereign, and the nation, for almost a century; but India was neither found, or seen, or heard of: this was wanting to the fame of Diaz, and this was the cause that all the glory of the discovery attached to Gama. Gama was a man of family*15, and Diaz sailed under him, with an inferior command ; he had not even the satisfaction of at tending his superior to the completion of his own discovery, but returned from St. Jago, and was again employed in a se condary command under Cabi;a], in the fleet that sailed to India in 1500. In this expedition Brasil was discovered, and in the passage from thence to the Cape, four ships perished, one of which was that of Bartholomew Dia% with all on board X It would seem natural that the discovery of Diaz should have been immediately prosecuted to its completion ; but it required a deliberation of ten years and another reign before a new ex pedition was undertaken ; and great debates are mentioned as passing in the council of Portugal, whether the attempt itself were expedient, or any advantage could be derived from it to. the nation at large. 4\" Paria.

At length when Emanuel had de- termined upon prosecuting the discovery of India, Gama was selected for the service, and was conducted to assume his com mand on board the fleet, under the most solemn auspices of religion427. The king, attended by all his court, accompanied the procession, and the great body of the people was attracted to the shore, who considered him and his followers rather as devoted to destruction, than as sent to the acquisition of renown.

They had on board several who spoke the Arabick language, and others who had acquired the Negro tongue by former voyages to the Gold Coast, Benin, and Congo. In the Bay of St. Helena they found the natives which we now call Hottentots, as we dis cover by the mention of a peculiarity in their utterance, which the journal calls sighing418, and which Vaillaut describes by the term clappement, a gutteral cluck, the characteristick of their language. None of the Negro interpreters understood this dialect. A quarrel arose between the voyagers, and these harmless and timid natives, from the suspicion of treachery, natural to those who visit barbarous nations for the first time ; and in the skirmish Gama himself was wounded in the foot. This acci dent hastened their departure. They left the Bay on the 16th of November; Alanquer declaring that the cape could not be much farther than thirty leagues distant, though he could not describe it, as he had passed it without seeing41' it, under the command of Diaz. For the four following days it was a con tinued tempest at south-south-west, during which Osorius430 in troduces the account of Gama's confining his pilot in irons, and standing to the helm himself.

This Bay still bears the name of St. Bras in our charts ; and the natives found here were the same as those of St. Helena. At St. Bias the fleet staid ten days, and was supplied with oxen by the natives. They found also penguins and sea lions in great numbers. They discharged and burnt the victualler, and then proceeded on their voyage to the eastward. The rock de la Cruz, where Diaz had erected his pillar, was by estimation sixty-five leagues from St. Bias, and the river Del Infante fifteen farther to the east. 'When Gama set sail the current was strong against him, but having the wind in his fa- vour, which blew a storm from the 8th to the 13th, he pushed forward till he was sixty leagues from St. Bias, on the 16th of December. Here he made the coast 43% which had a good ap- pearance, with herds of cattle on the shore. He passed within sight of de la Cruz, and wished to have come to an anchor at the river Del Infante, but the wind being adverse, he was obliged to stand out to sea, till on the 20th of December it came again to the west, and carried him through the currents which had opposed him all round the Cape. The good fortune which attended him in obtaining this wind, at the time when the current was most unfavourable, inspired his heart with gratitude: he humbled himself with pious acts of devotion be fore his Creator, to whose especial Providence he imputed his \u00ab\" Somewhere about Cape Arrecife or Foul Cape."], [276, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 240 success, and declared to his people, that he verily believed it was the will of God that India should be discovered433. From the 20th to the 25th he ran along a coast which he styled Terra de Natal, from the celebration of the Nativity on that day. It lies between latitude 32\u00b0 30' 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 south ; and on the 6th of January 149S he reached a river whicK he named De los Reyes, from the feast of the Epiphany; he did not anchor here, though in great want of water, but proceeded till the 11th, when he landed at a river called Cobio434, and which, from the treatment he received, he left afterwards marked with the appellation of Rio des buonas Gentes, or the River of Good People. The natives here were no longer Hottentots but Caffres, who even in that age bore the same marks of superior civilization, which they preserve to the present hour. A circumstance more fortunate and more extraordinary was, that Martin Alonzo understood their language. This is a most remarkable occur rence, as Alonzo could scarcely have been lower than Mina on the western coast, which is forty degrees- from the Cape, and the breadth of the continent from west to east cannot, in the latitude of 20\u00b0 south, be less than eighteen or nineteen decrees more. What Negro nation or language do we know of such an extent? and yet wonderful as it is, there is no reason to doubt the fact. These people had mean houses, but well furnished, and were possessed of iron, copper, pewter, salt, and ivory. The fleet staid here till the 15th, and obtained wood, water, fowls, and oxen.

It is a circumstance particularly noticed by the historians, that from St. Helena to this place no vestige of navigation, no sort of embarkation had been seen. But here, upon the morn ing after their arrival, they were visited by the natives in boats, which had sails made of the Palm436.

I find nothing in Castaneda or Faria to mark the extent of Gaina's knowledge at this place, but as he had the corrected chart of Covilham on board, in which Sofala was marked as* the limit of his progress; if that chart was furnished with the latitude, Gama must have known that he had now passed the barrier, and that the discovery was ascertained, as the most southern branch of the Zambeze is two degrees to the north of Sofala. He must likewise know that the directions given by Covilham were to inquire for Sofala and the island of the Moon 44J. And whether he understood the language of the natives or not, the name of Sofala443 must have been pronounced to them in aa. intercourse of thirty days, and the quarter where it lay must have been obtained.

Ptolemy445 mentions two Roman officers, Septimius Flaccus and Julius Maternus, who had been engaged in these expeditions to the south, Flaccus from Cy rene4*6, and Matemus from Leptis. Flaccus reported that the Ethiopians [of Agisymba] were three months journey south of the Garamanf.es, and Flaccus seems to have performed this march himself. Maternus reported, that when the king of the Garamantes set out from Garama to attack the Ethiopians of Agisymba, he marched four months to the south. Ptolemy does not allow the use made of these reports by the geographer Marinus, which would carry Agisymba into 49\u00b0 or 55o south latitude, still under his own correction he carries Prasum447 into latitude 15\u00b0, and Agisymba somewhat farther to the south. Wonderful as this march of Flaccus is to contemplate, through the very heart and most desert part of Africa into such a latitude, it is still more extraordinary that the latitude of Prasum should coincide with Mosambique, and that two or three degrees farther to the south, the kingdom, of Benomo tapa44Xhould occur, in which Zimbao is still the name of a And the Phenicians, if Sofala is Opliir. silver, as Faria affirms, (vel. iii. p. 148.) and gold is also found in the streams which come down from the mountains.

We may suppose all these rivers which come to the south productive of gold, as well as the river of Benomotapa. And as the kingdom of Abyssinia in its more flourishing state certainly extended its influence to Magadoxo, in latitude 50 north, so may we discover the means by which, in all ages, the gold du6t of the south found its way into that kingdom. Bruce says it has no gold of its own, and yet gold by the ounce, and bricks of salt, are the current coin of the kingdom. This method of procuring gold in Abyssinia from the south was known both to the Greeks and Arabs, and must apparently have been the pri mary cause of their voyage to the south, and possibly of those performed by the Idumeans, Ph\u0153nicians, and Solomon to Ophir, if Ophir and Sofala be the same. In Sumatra, the na tive name fora gold mine is Ophir, and this is perhaps one reason for some of the learned placing Solomon's Ophir there.

At this river of Zambeze we have a right to consider the dis covery of Gama as accomplished, for here he had united his cir cumnavigation with the route of Covilham ; but we must conduct him to Quiloa, in order to make him meet the limit, of the Peri pltts at Rhaptum, and to Melinda, before he obtained a pilot to conduct him to the Indies.

Gama was formed for the service to which he was called, violent indeed in his temper, terrible in anger, and sudden in the execution of justice, but at the same time intrepid, per severing, patient in difficulties, fertile in expedients, and su perior to all opposition. Courage is a quality common to thousands, but fortitude exists only in a noble mind ; and few instances of fortitude are more conspicuous than that of Gama, when, upon being detained in Calicut by the Zamorin, he ordered his brother to sail without him, that his country might not be deprived of the fruits of his discovery. To the virtues of a commander he added the religion of a Christian, and though the religion of his age was never without a tincture of chivalry and superstition, in one sense at least his religion was genuine and sincere. It was religion that supported him under the perils he encountered, and a firm persuasion that it was the will of Providence that India should be discovered. The con sequence of his discovery was the subversion of the Turkish power, which at that time kept all Europe in alarm. The east no longer paid tribute for her precious commodities, which passed through the Turkish provinces ; the revenues of that empire wjere diminished ; the Othmans ceased to be a terror to the western world, and Europe464 has risen to a power which the other three continents may in vain endeavour to oppose. Portugal it is true has lost her pre-eminence in the east, but she still retains Brasil, which was the accident of her Oriental 464 Such is the opinion both of Abbe Ray- See\"fa Mickle, p. 8j. a citation from Faria to rial, Mickle, Dr. Campbell, Harris, &c. &c. this effect.

The reader will pardon this digression in favour of a man whom no historian ever contemplated without admiration, but if the history of the man does not attach to the purpose of the present work, the account of his voyage is one of its constituent parts. Our design has been to shew all that the ancients per formed, or could not. perform, and the voyage of Gama has been detailed, with all its difficulties, in order to prove the utter improbability of any previous navigation round the Cape. I will not say it was impracticable, but I think it impossible to have been once performed and never prosecuted ; I think it impossible that it should have stood upon the page of history as an insulated fact, through a lapse of one-and-twenty cen turies, without imitation or repetition of the experiment. XXVIII. It remains still to shew the relative situation of the Arabs on this coast of Africa, such as the Greeks and Romans left them, and such as the Portuguese found them upon their arrival in the Eastern Ocean. The Peripltis mentions that the Arabs of Rhapta were subject to the sovereign of Maphartis, and Maphartis itself was one of the dependencies of Sabea or Yemen. They employed the vessels sewed with coco cordage, from whence the name of the place wTas derived, and they traded to India, Arabia, the Red Sea, and Egypt. Arabs of the same description Gama found here after the expiration of thirteen centuries, the same vessels- on the coast, and the same foreign trade. One circumstance indeed was different, the re ligion of Mahomed had at the same time it introduced superior"], [287, "AZANIA. 251 vigour, and a more extensive commerce, engendered a hatred to the Christian name, which excited that malice and treachery which Gama experienced, and which, perhaps, without a dif ference of faith, the rivalship in commerce must necessarily have produced. Of these Arabs there were two distinct parties, one called Zaydes or Emozaides, who were the first settlers upon record, and the other a tribe from Baca in the Gulph of Persia near Bahrein465. The Emozaides were heretieks of the sect of Ali ; they came from Yemen, and seem to have occupied the coast of Africa, after the time of Mahomed, in the same manner as their Heathen brethren had settled there in the age of the Peri phis. The tribe from Baca were Sonnites or orthodox, who hate the Shiites worse than Christians ; they had seized first uoon Quiloa, and had extended their power for two hundred miles along the coast, but from their internal dissensions were declining in power when the Portuguese first arrived in the Indian Ocean. Upon the introduction of this tribe from Baca4C6, the Emozaides retired inland and became Bedouins467; they intermarried with the natives, and still exist as black Arabs, little distinguished from the Caffres who are found both on the continent and in the islands468, which lie in the Mosambique channel, and even in the island of Madagascar. 465 Di Barros, in Ramusio, vol. i. p. 3S6, et seq. Jones says the family came from the main. The proper name is Hinzuan, which became Anjuan, and Arjoane easily made Johanna by an English seaman. It is one of the Comora Isles between Madagascar and the continent : and Comora still preserves the name of Comr, the Arabick name of Madagascar, the Island of the Moon. 466 If we may judge from Nitbuhr they ought to be of the tribe Beiii Houle, in Oman. 46' Wandering tribes that live in tents. 468 The king os' Johanna is perhaps of this cast, half Arab and half Ntgro, as Sir William K K 2"], [288, "PERIFLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 252 The whole coast below Mombaca was under the power of these Sonnites from Baca; but Mombaca had revolted, was independent, and had a sovereign of its own, who was a Sonnite; while Brava and Magadoxo46' were styled republicks, where the power was in the hands of twelve470 principal families form ing an aristocracy, perhaps as conspicuous on that coast as Venice was in the Iladriatick. This state of the country is perfectly analogous to the de scription of it in the Periplus; every city, says that journal, 463 An account of Magadoxo is inserted in Captain Hamilton's Account of the East Indies, vol. i. p. 12. and copied by Astley \u00a3Green], vol. iii. p. 3S9. where mention is made of an English ship, called the Albemaile, in 1700, out of which a boat was sent on shore, and the people never heard of. In this there is nothing very extraordinary ; but what Ha milton did not know is, that a Mulatto, be longing to this boat, has left a memoir on the subject, which is preserved in the British Museum, 2992. Plut. xx. F. ; in which he mentions the murder of the English, and that he was himself reduced to slavery, in which he continued sixteen years. At the expiration of this term, while he was accompanying an ex pedition of the natives against Baiidtm and Saem, he escaped on board a Dutch ship, and returned to England when he found his captain, Mr. William Bcawes, still alive. The reader will not be offended with the introduction of this note, when he is in formed that Magadoxo has still some resem blance to a republic. The king's manner of living, house, and appearance, is inferior to that of some of his officers ; and his power cir cumscribed. This Memoir is accompanied with drawings of the town and buildings, called Morsacks, which are p'aces of burial, and bestow rank upon those to whose family they belong. There are other drawings of natural history, not valuable indeed, but the whole remarkable as the production of a Mulatto. 4'\u00b0 The love of independence is the ruling principle in the mind of an Arab, and a pa. triarchal sovereignty is the only one to which he can naturally submit. This it is which drives so many petty tribes into the deserts, which they occupy from Mesopotamia to the frontiers of Morocco, and from the coasts of the Persian Gulph to Mosambique. The re sidence in cities is unnatural to them, and though they do occupy places which they have conquered, still every city must have its chief, and every chief finds a party within his walls which is hostile to his government. Niebuhr has painted this spirit of the people most ad mirably throughout his work. But the Ma homedan religion has also produced an aristo cratick principle, subsisting under all the de spotism of the east. The Ulemas, under the Turkish government, are an aristocracy be tween the monarch and the people; and who ever is acquainted with Oriental manners, knows that there were families which preserved a sort of ruling power in Samarkand, Bigdat, Basra, and all the principal cities of the east. Such a junction of families might well exist at Brava and Magadoxo, when the Portuguese first visited the coast ; and any government where there was no ostensible chief would suggest to them the idea of a republkk. 'Z"], [289, "AZANIA. 253 was a separate government, and every government hast its in dependent chief. Such they were in that age, and such they might have continued if an European power had not arisen, which overwhelmed them all in a period of less than twenty years. Sofala, Mosambique, Quiloa, Angoxa, Ocha, Pate, Mombaza, Brava, and the Zanguebar Islands, all submitted to Diego Almeida, and Tristan d'Acugna before the year 150S. Melinda, which had always been friendly, lost all her import ance, and Magadoxo only resisted with effect ; but whether from the bravery of the people, or because it lay too much to the north to be of importance, is hard to determine. Had they not been conquered they must have sunk in their importance from the natural course of events ; the sinews of their commerce were cut, and their ships could not sail without a Portuguese pass. The produce indeed of the coast itself would still have maintained these cities from utter decadence, and brought foreigners to their ports ; but the power of the Portuguese monopolized all profits, till it fell in its turn by the errors of the government, and by the avarice and peculation of its officers. Of all these conquests which do so much credit to their valour, and so little to their policy, Mosambique is the only possession which has survived the wreck of their empire ; and this port is said still to be a profitable settlement, and to preserve an influence over the other states, which have reverted again into the power of the Arabs ; among these the Imam471 of 4,1 Letters of Merchants, (in Gyna:us, inde concedunt Cambayam sive Meccham.

The present Book will comprize all that con cerns the commerce of Arabia, both in the interior, and op the coast. The Periplsts is still to form the basis of our investigation ; but as the object proposed is to give a general account of the communication with the East, no apology is requisite for de taining the reader from the immediate contemplation of the work itself. A variety of scattered materials, all centring at the same point, are to be collected, before a comprehensive view can be presented, or an accurate judgment formed ; and if this task can be executed with the fidelity and attention*. which the nature of the subject requires, the general result will be preferable to the detail of a single voyage, in the same pro portion as a whole is superior to its parts. The commencement, then, of this second voyage is again from Berenike, and from this port there were two routes practised in the age of the author; one, down the gulph to' Mooza and Okelis direct, and the other, first up to Muos Hormus, and then across the gulph by the promontory Pharan, or Cape Mahomed, to Leuke Kome in Arabia. This latter route is the immediate object of our consideration. LEUKE KOM-'E. II. Leuke Kome, or the White Village, I shall place nearly at the Mouth of the bay of Acaba, the Elanitick Gulph of the"], [303, "ARABIA. 259 ancients * ; and my reasons for assuming this position will be given at large in their proper place. But to this village we are immediately directed by the journal, after a passage of two or three days from Muos Hormus; for -here, we are informed, \" was the point of communication with Petra the capital of \" the country, the residence of Malichas the king of the Na \" bat\u00a3ans. Leuke. Kome itself had the rank of a mart in \" respect to the small vessels which obtained * their cargoes in \" Arabia ; for which reason there was a garrison placed in it \" under the command of a centurion, both for the purpose of \" protection, and in order to collect a duty of twenty-five in \" the hundred*\" [upon the. exports and imports]. We obtain, in these few words, a variety of particulars highly important to the subject of our consideration ; for we find a native king under the controul of the Romans, a duty levied upon the trade of the natives, and the nature of the com munication between the port and the capital. And if we now reflect that the intercourse with the capital Avas rather fixed here, at the mouth of the Elanitiek gulph, than either at E'lana itself, or at Ezion Geber, we shall discover the same principle as operated on the Egyptian coast, where the communication 1 A comparative table, containing the dif ferent distribution of the ancient names, by M. d'Anville and M.

In the a^e of the Periplus, as this course was the less fre quented of the two, so is it apparent that the commerce itself Avas of less importance; the vessels employed are Arabian, and the duty seems collected on them only : possibly the ships, which touched here after crossing from Muos Hormus, had paid the customs in that port, and made this harbour chiefly for the purpose of accommodation, or of ascertaining their route doAvn the coast of Arabia. Very different is the idea that I conceive of this trade Avhile the communication Avith Egypt Avas in the hands of the Arabians themselves, previous to the appearance of Ptolemy's fleets upon the Red Sea, and their immediate communication with Sabea ; for the caravans, in all ages, from Minea4 in the interior of Arabia, and from Gerrha on the gulph of Persia, from Hadra maut on the ocean, and some even from Sabea or Yemen, appear to have pointed to Petra, as a common centre; and from Petra the trade seems to have been again branched out in every direction to Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, through Arsinoe, Gaza, Tyre, Jerusalem, Damascus, and a variety of subordinate routes that all terminated on the Mediter- ranean. It is not consonant to the design of this Avork to enter into any commerce antecedent to history ; but from analogy, from. the magnificence recorded of Nineve and Babylon, from the 4 The position of the Minei is dubious: from Mecca, torn. ii. p. ut?.; Strabo places Bochart supposes them to be in the vicinity of Carana of the Mincans next to the Sabeans..

This is a fact which will admit of proof as soon as history commences; but we may pause a moment to observe, that though the Chaldeans and Assyrians might have been navigators themselves, as the gulph of Persia opened a communication for them with the Indian Ocean, and their works at Babylon and Teredon intimate some attention to the advantages of a naval power; still the Indians5, Persians, and Egyptians, seem to have been restrained by prejudices, either political or religious, from distant navigation ; and though Persia and Egypt manifestly reaped the profits of an Oriental commerce which passed through these countries to others more distant, either on the north or on the west, still the common centre was Arabia6: the Arabians had no ob- structions either from manners, laws, habits, or religion ; and as there is every proof that is requisite, to shew that the Tyrians and.

There is a secondary connexion also between the families, for Esau married Bashemath \", the sister of Nebaioth. Little respect as has been paid to the genealogies li of scripture by some Avriters of the present day, it is still to be considered\" that the Bible may be tried by the rule of history as Avell as inspiration, and that the traditions of the Arabians are in harmony Avitb the writings of Moses; for they universally acknoAvledge Joktan'4, the fourth from Shem, as the origin of those tribes which oc- cupied Sabea and Hadramaut, that is, Yemen and the incense country.

For I neither carry Ophir to Peru24 Avith Arius Montanus, or to Malacca Avith Josephus, or to Ceylon Avith Bochart, be cause I consider all these suppositions as founded upon no better evidence than the mention of gold in those countries ; but our choice must lie between the coast of Africa and Sabea. Monicsquieu, Bruce, and d'Anville, have determined in favour of Africa, principally, I think, because gold has always been an export from that country, Avhile the precious metals were usually carried to Sabea, to purchase the commodities of the east. I alloAV great weight to this argument; and I admit the probability of d'Anville's supposition, that the Ophir of Arabia might naturally produce an Ophir on the coast of Africa, which should, by an easy etymology, pass into Sophir, Sophar, So pharah el Zange, or Sophala : but I by no means subscribe to the system of Bruce, Avhich he has displayed Avith so much in genuity and ostentation; and Avhich he thinks established by the discovery of an anomalous monsoon prevailing from Sofala to Melinda.

The duration it should seem easy to account for, upon a different principle ; for the navigators Avere Ph\u0153nicians, and Ave learn from Homer'8 their method of conducting business in a foreign port. They had no factors to whom they could con sign a cargo in the gross, or Avho could furnish them, on the emergence, Avith a lading in return; but they anchored in a harbour, Avhere they Avere their OAvn brokers, and disposed of their cargoes by retail.

But my reasons for adhering to the opinions of Prideaux and Gossellin are, first, that Ophir29 is mentioned 30 Avith Havilah and Jobab, all three sons of Joktan ; and all of them, as avcII as Joktan, have their residence in Arabia Felix, most probably count obtained, was, that the winds are much easterly hereabouts, and as often to the north of the true east, as to the southward of it. 27 Pliny, on a much shorter distance, that is, from Azania to Ocila or Okelis, makes the voyage five years.

It is particularly added, that the royal visitant brought a present of spices : \" there Avere no such spices as the queen34 of Sheba gave to Solomon.\" I do not Avish to conceal an objection to this supposition; which is, that spices, although they are taxed, are never men tioned as an article of importation from Ophir. The produce \u00a9f the voyage is gold, silver, ivory, al mug-trees35, apes, pea cocks, and precious stones. But as on the one hand this failure in the invoice Avill argue much more forcibly against any of the more distant Ophirs which have been assumed ; soon the other, it is no proof against Sabea, that several of these articles are not native; for these, and many more than are enumerated, 31 i Kings, x. io, ii.

Marcian, inde:d, does not speak very highly of Timosthenes, and yet, by this account, it should seem that El-a tosthenes's knowledge of the Thht\u00e6 was from Timosther-es, who had commanded the fleet of Ptolemy Philadelphus on tire Indian Ocean, and had gone farther down the coast of Africa than any other Greek of his age.

V. 67 After this, Ave must allow of a similar voyage, per formed by the Indians to Arabia, or by the Arabians to India, previous to the performance of it by the Greeks ; because the Greeks, as late as the reign of Philometor, met this commerce in Sab\u0153a. VI. *8 And lastly, Ave obtain an incidental knoAvledge of a voyage which confirms all that has been advanced concerning the early commerce of the Arabians, previous, in all appear ance, to every account we receive from the Greeks, and con ducted, certainly, by the monsoon, long before Hippalus intro duced the knoAvledge of that Avind to the Roman Avorld.

If it could be believed that the natives of India had been navigators in any age, Ave might more readily admit their claim in this in stance than in any other; for the author mentions, that the imports into Africa are the production of the interior from Barugaza and Ariake; that is, from Cambay, Guzerat, and Concan : and the articles specified confirm the truth of his assertion ; for they are rice 70, ghee, oil of sesamum, cotton, muslins, sashes, and sugar : these commodities, he adds, are brought sometimes in vessels destined expressly for the coast of Africa ; at other times, they are only a part of the cargo out of vessels which are proceeding to another port. Thus Ave have jiianifestly two methods of conducting this commerce, perfectly distinct : one, to Africa direct ; and another, by touching on this coast, Avith a final destination to Arabia. This is precisely the same trade as the Portuguese found at Melinda and Quiloa, and the same connection Avith Arabia ; and this is the reason that the Greeks found cinnamon, and the produce of India, on this coast, Avhen they first ventured to pass the Straits 7I, in order to seek a cheaper market than Sab\u0153a.

But Dio- dorus (lib. i. p. 64.) carries him by sea to India, and by land, to the eastern coast of China : so little trouble does it cost an histo- rian to convey his hero to the world's end, when he is not embarrassed with circumstances. If any date could be affixed to the reign of Sesostris, if his conquests could be reconciled with the history of the nations he is said to have conquered, I should think it highly pro- bable that he knew of an Indian commerce in Arabia, or Africa, and wished to partake of it ; and even as the fact stands, it appears as if Herodotus was fully justified in supposing, that some attempts had been made by the Egyptians to enter the Erythtean Sea. But the Egyptians seem to have attributed all their wonders to Sesostris, as the Greeks did theirs to Hercules ; and it is as difficult to reconcile the date of his reign to reason, as the chro- nology of the Egyptians to scripture. The truly learned and most excellent translator of Herodotus professes his belief in scripture, and deprecates all conclusions against the scrip- tures which may be drawn from his chrono logy : it is a protest of importance, because his first date makes the establishment of Egypt 13,566 years, and the building of Memphis S>352 years prior to the creation, according to the Mosaical account i and it is not with out a sense of the contradiction that we read the following words : \" II est done constant u que notre historien a ete la fidele interprete \" des pretres Egyptiens, & qu'il n'y avoit pas \" la plus legen incoherence dans leur recits.\" Chronol.

Since the time that these observations were made, we have another edition of Hercdotu* by the same excellent translator, who, in the 76th year of his age, repeats his belief in the scriptures, and recalls every thing in his workt that may seem of a contrary tendency to the history they contain.

In the time of Marco Polo, the Arabians had not only increased on the coast of India, but made considerable progress in extending the doctrines of the Coran : he mentions the trade from China 77 which met the trade from the Red Sea, no longer in Ceylon, but on the coast of Malabar; and though he remarks- that the Chinese vessels sometimes penetrated farther, even to Madagascar, yet the central mart is manifestly in Malabar, and apparently at Calicut, Avhere the Portuguese found it upon their first arrival.

The date of this voyage, sixty or eighty years previous to the discovery of Gama, makes it highly interesting ; and the in formation is unique, for Nicolo sailed on board an Indian il ship ; 78 Lord Macartney is fully convinced that the Chinese compass is not derived from the Europeans : his reasons for this may be seen in a paper with which he has furnished me (Appendix, No. III.) ; and has obligingly permitted me to publish with his name.

And this testimony is of greater importance, because the date of his voyage from Borneo must be in 1503 or 1504, as he returned to Calicut in 1506, when Almeyda was viceroy.

WEALTH OP ARABIA. VI. After the recital of these circumstances, it is still to be considered, that in the Avhole of Avhat has been said, it is in tended to speak only in general terms : it is not meant to assert, that no ships Avent to India from Egypt before the reign of Ptolemy JPhilom\u0153tor, or that no Greeks, in a later age, passed beyond Ceylon to Bengal, or the Golden Chersonese ; but that the ordinary course of Oriental commerce Avas conducted in the way that has been stated, there is every reason to believe, and every evidence that is extant to prove. The value of this com merce, in the hands of the Arabians, is equally evident : their wealth Avas proverbial, and the particulars of it are detailed by Agatharchides. But there is still one point in Avhich the Ara bians are essentially distinguished from all the surrounding na tions, which, through their means, partook in the commerce of the east ; which is, that hoAvever ostentatious their neighbours might be, the riches of the Arabians Avere all applied to their private luxury and indulgence.

It is the influence over their government, and the possession of their harbours on the Red Sea by the Romans, which is now to be investigated ; and if the command of the commerce obtained by this power continued with little interruption till the time of Justinian, and was not annihilated till the irruption of the Ma homedans, it is a duration of this commerce in one channel, longer than has fallen to the lot of any other people in whose hands it has been placed. LEUKE KOME. Our inquiry commences with Leuke Komk, or the White Village87; and the character of White is attributed to several towns or villages on this coast. Ptolemy has an Arge Kome below Yambo ; Haur is another place, about three hundred miles from the head of the gulph; and a third, Hartr or Ha varra is discoverable in the Itinerary, but forty-five miles from the same point. All these terms imply whiteness ; but d'An ville assumes the second for the Leuke Kome of the Periplris. In this he is justly supposed by M.

M.

This arises from a cause which operates on the whole eastern side of the gulph ; and in the lower part of it there are the remains of places twenty miles inland, which were formerly marts or harbours. This must be accepted as a reason Avhy so little satisfaction can be given in regard to individual positions.

Upon these authorities I had Avished to have placed this Havarra on the coast, and to have assumed it for the site of the White Village; more especially as the Itinerary of the Peutingerian Tables points to the entrance of the Elanitick Gulph, and has one route of sixty-one miles from Aila to Havarra, and another92 of '9 But I am apprehensive that I read 20 twice instead of once ; if so, it is only 45 miles from Haila to Hauarra, and 38 from Hauarra to Petra.

Still, whatever be the errors, it is curious to see both these routes detailed at the extremity of the empire, in the reign of Theodosius ; and the shorter the distances are, the more incompatible they are with the Haur of d'Anville. (See d'An ville's Egypt, p. 129. with his opinion of the Itineraries.) There is a similar diminution of distance from Phara, or Ras Mahomet, to Haila, which the Itinerary makes only 16 miles ; and both deficiencies, if they are such, must be imputed to the supposed shortness of the sea of Acaba, i. e. the Elanitick Gulph.

But in opposition to this Ave have the express testimony of Ptolemy'4, that Avarra is inland, and more northerly'than Aila.

TIIAMUDENI AND CANRAITES. This author, at the entrance of the Elanitick Gulph, has three islands : one, sacred to Isis ; and the tAvo others called Sookabu.a5s and Salydo. These islands, after having been' lost for twenty centuries, have been restored to geography by M. map; iSom. Engsh by Dela Rochette's ; 225 by Capt. Cook's chart. When we find therefore only 120 miles in the Itinerary, we must suppose that a distance is omitted between Arsinoe and Clysma, for both, are noticed ; but there is no number between the two, and Clysma is placed on the eastern side of the gulph, not on the western, as in d'Anville. But if the numbers we have, express the sense of the author, then we must add a third at least ; and, by the same proportion, a third from Phara or Ras Ma homed to Haila, making that nearly 67 B. miles ; a distance that agrees neither with d'Anville or De la Rochette, for both make it near no. I have always supposed this dis tance much too large ; and if Irwin's Chart might be depended on, my judgment must be right. Irwin is the only traveller I have met with who has entered the Elanitick Gulph ; but though he speaks of the head, he does not quite say that he saw it. 93 The Zaanatha of Ptolemy. 94 See Tab.

He is the only voyager, as far as I can discover, who has ever entered this bay ; and if his chart may be depended upon, he went up it five-and-twenty miles : in consequence of this he saw these islands, and has named them Tirdn, Sanasir, and Barkan. I have never seen them in any chart, previous to his, arranged in the same order; but they bear such testimony to the fidelity of Agatharchides, that he deserves credit when he adds, that \" they 96 cover several harbours on the Arabian \" shore\" [as the Zaffateen Islands protect the port of Muos Hormus] ; and one of these harbours, I conclude, must be the Leuke Kome of the Periplus ; for he adds, \" to these islands \" succeeds the rocky coast of the Thamud\u0153ni, Avhere, for more \" than a thousand stadii, there is no harbour, no road Avhere \" a vessel can anchor, no bay to afford protection, no scrap of \" a projecting point, to Avhich the mariner can fly for refuge \" in a moment of distress.\" HoAvever the colouring of this picture may be heightened, the general description is true, as may be seen by a reference to M.

This appella tion proves that it was a place of consequence in that early age ; and history shews that there is hardly a place which deserves the name of city, except Mecca and Medina, in all that space Avhich o-eograohers allot to Arabia Deserta, across the vast peninsula, from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulph and the Euphrates. The numerous tribes Avhich inhabit this desert are the Saraceni of the ancients, so called from Saharra 103 or Sarra, a desert, and corresponding exactly with the modern term of Bedoweens. In what sense this country is a desert, was un known to the ancients, and is almost equally unknown to us; but that it is not arid, so as to preclude the produce of the earth, is evident from the SAvarms Avhich these tribes furnished in the early period of the Mahomedan conquests, and from the consideration that every Arab is a horseman. Little as will suffice to support an Arab and his horse, both must be sup ported ; if little corn is sowed or consumed, still those Avho live on the product of their herd must find pasture for their oxen, sheep, camels, and horses ; and though many expatriate for this purpose in the season, the majority still remains at home, both Avinter and summer. Neither can their predatory life supply all their Avants ; for a whole nation must have a national support. Robbers as they are, they do not rob every one ; the caravans still distribute all the merchandize Avhich comes an nually to the ports of Y'ambo and Jidda, through this very country ; and in the commerce Avhich the ancients describe, there Avas a regular intercourse between Sab\u0153a and Petra, from the South, and betAveen the gulph of Persia and Petra, from \"3 Bedijah-Campania, Reiske in Abilfedam, nutrices ex al Bedijah (/'.,;.

This trade104 has fluctuated in different ages, from external causes : it is at this moment, perhaps, at a lower ebb than ever, from the commercial superiority of the Europeans in the Eastern Ocean, and from a diminution in the spirit of pilgrimage. But Mecca and Medina are still to be considered as marts135 rather than sanctuaries; and the commodities brought by the English from India, and by the Turks from Suez, still centre at Jidda \"*, as an emporium of considerable importance. It is the Turkish trade from Suez Avhich the Romans occupied by being masters of Berenike, Muos Hormus, Petra, and Leuke Kome. It js the English trade from India, Avhich the Greeks and Romans first found in the hands of the Sab\u0153ans, and afterwards assumed to themselves, as soon as they had fleets on the Red Sea that neither feared the Nabatctan pirates at the head of the gulph, or the Sab\u0153an merchants at the straits ; and from the time they learned the nature of the monsoon from Hip pal us, they made a voyage to India more advantageous, than the purchase of a cargo at.

EXPEDITION OF ELIUS GALLUS. The voyao-e from Suez or Arsinoe was first planned by Neco ; it was afterwards meditated by Alexander, and it was executed by the Ptolemies previous to the establishment of Muos Hormus and Berenike. It was not unknown to the Romans when they reduced Egypt, though then in disuse; but Elius Gallus set out on his expedition from this port, and Strabo imputes his failure to this circumstance as a leading cause. Strabo laments that this expedition added little to the geo graphical knowledge of Arabia; and we have reason to com plain that Strabo, Avho lived in habits of intimacy Avith Gallus, has recorded so little of the information which might have been obtained from that commander. The consequence is, that d'Anville, -who follows Pliny, carries the Roman arms to Ma riaba, the Mareb of the Arabians ; and that M. Gossellin, by his interpretation of Strabo, supposes Mariaba, or Marsy'aba, to be the Maco-raba107 of Ptolemy, the Mecca of Mahomed. The distance betAveen these tAvo places is little short of nine degrees ; so that the difference between the two estimates is 675 Roman miles. If there Avere any data to determine this dispute, no labour should have deterred me from investigating it to the utmost; but as Pliny says, that the places Avhich occurred in the expedi tion of Gallus are not found in authors previous to his time, the same may be said of subsequent Avriters ; for there is not one of 'i Mecca is always written Macca by Reiske, in his version of Abilfeda ; and Macca signifies aa habitation.

This is the reason that compels me to give a sketch only of an expedition so intimately connected with the commerce of the ancients in Arabia. The commission of Gallus from Augustus was to explore Ethiopia, the country of the Troglodytes, and Arabia. The first part Avas executed by Petronius, his lieutenant, and ter minated by the submission of Candake, queen of Merofe. But Arabia, Gallus reserved for himself; and the country of the Troglodytes he crossed when he landed at Muos Hormus, on his return. This expedition commenced at Cleopatris I0S, in the neighbourhood of the modern Suez, where we find him at the head of an army consisting of ten thousand Romans, five hundred Jews, and a thousand Nabat\u0153ans from Petra, with a fleet of eighty 109 vessels of war, and an hundred and thirty transports. Syli\u0153us110, the minister of O'bodas king of Petra, Avas to conduct this force; but his interest Avas concerned in defeating the expedition, which he effected, and aftenvards paid the forfeit for his treachery with his life. The first error into Avhich he led Gallus, Avas the preparation of a fleet, Avhich consumed '\" much time, and Avas of no service; for the army might have proceeded from Cleopatris to Petra, and thence to 108 Cleopatris is considered as Arsinoe ; but perhaps Arsinoe, Cleopatris, and Suez, have all followed the retreat of the sea at the head of the gulph. tides were brought across the desert from Cairo on camels. In this manner a fleet of 76 vessels was constructed, which, from the time it weighed from Suez, was ten days be fore it reached Tor, and left it on the eleventh.

This, however, was for a single ship, and Gallus had a fleet ; but we must suppose he continued his course up the coast to the northward, and came by Ras Mahomed to the Egyptian shore. Much difficulty stands in the way of calculation ; and, after all, it is not quite clear whether Strabo's eleven days are to be reckoned from the time Gallus reached Neia, or from the day he left it : I conclude the latter to be intended. A Negra is men tioned by Cedrenus, p. 364. 500 years later : this is evidently Najeran, where, according to the Roman Martyrology, St. Arethas was put to death by Dunaan a Jew, king of the Homerites.

But if it were possible to give the rea/ler satisfaction on the extent of it, no apology would be requisite for the digression. This, from the scantiness of materials, can not be done ; but as my conjectures differ both from d'Anville and M. Gossellin, I shall barely state the grounds on which they are founded, and leave the determination to the judgment of the reader. The first step tOAvards fixing the termination of the expedi tion, Avould be to distinguish Marsy'aba from all the cities with Avhich it is confounded. The Marsy'aba of Strabo is in the country of the Rhamanit\u00e6, and under the government of Ilasarus. It is not the Mareb of Sabea, where the great Tank I21 is, for that he calls Meriaba of the Sab\u0153ans ; and this sufficiently declares against d'Anville's system, Avhich carries Gallus into Sab\u0153a, and on Avhich Gos sellin justly observes, that if Gallus had besieged Mareb, he Avould not have been obliged to raise the siege for Avant of water, the reason assigned by Strabo. Ptolemy has likewise a Maraba (written Baraba in the text) which he places in the country of the Mineans, and calls it a metropolis ; and a Mariama, tAvo degrees to the south-east ; but he has no Mariaba either in Sab\u0153a or the country of the Homerites. His Elisari, the llasar of Strabo, are still farther south than the Mineans, aud upon the coast. \u25a0\u2122 Mareb is still the capital of a large pro- concerning the Tank, the queen of Sheba. vince in Yemen called Dsjof, between Najeran &c. are still current.

It is apparently then the Mariaba K* of the Calingii which he informs us, contrary to the assertion of Strabo, that Gallus took, and finished his invasion at Caripeta. But it is still more extraordinary, that the. other cities Jie mentions as taken and destroyed by Gallus, do not, in any one instance, correspond with those of Strabo, except that his Negra is pos sibly Nagrana124. Dio I25 terminates the irruption at Athlula, evidently the Athrulla of Strabo : he mentions the army being afflicted Avith a disease in the head and legs ; and adds, that Gallus did not merely retreat, but Avas driven out by the natives. The Avhole of this goes to prove, that Gallus did not reach Mareb Baramalcum ; and, in short, the fact is impossible ; for that Mareb is above eleven \"6 hundred miles from Moilah, and the retreat of Gallus, in sixty days, Avould require a march of almost tAventy miles a day, which, for such a continuance, is not to be performed. But if the Mareb of d'Anville be too distant, the Mecca of Gossellin is too near; for the route of the caravan, froni Moilah to Mecca, makes it only 731 miles, at S miles an hour. ,M Bahr-u-melk, Bahr-u-malk, Bahr-u-mal- Kt See note supra. kim ; the Lake of the King, or the Kings; '\" Lib. liii. p. 3 jo.

If, therefore, Gallus was advancing for six months, he must have marched little more than an hundred miles a month. And let us suppose, Avith Gossellin, all the fraud of Sylleus, and all the deviations of the march he pleases, this advance is far less than a Roman army can be supposed to make. The country Gallus Avas desirous of reaching, Avas the country of gold \"7, frankincense, myrrh, and Spices, certainly either Ha dramaut or Yemen ; and when he Avas at Marsdaba, he Avas told he Avas but tAvo days distance from the province he Avished to enter. He might be deceived in that, and most probably he was ; but the deception could hardly amount to the difference between two -days and thirty, and Mecca is little short of thirty days from Hadramaut. Gossellin supposes Athrulla to be Yathreb or Medina, and Marsliaba to be Macoraba or Mecca ; but it is not easy to dis cover the resemblance of these names, or the other five he gives from Pliny. Strabo is surely a better guide, who was in habits of intimacy with Gallus, and Avho received the names most probably from his report. Pliny says, that Marstiaba Avas taken, and that the expedition terminated at Caripeta : Strabo \"7 Strabo, 780."], [353, "ARABIA. 309 asserts, that Marsuaba was not taken, and does not notice Caripeta at all. It is not safe to build on similarity of names ; * but Nagrana, Avhich Gossellin supposes to be Al Nokra128, is certainly more nearly related to Najeran in sound. Najeran is assuredly as ancient as Mahomed's time : it is a conspicuous province still, according to Niebuhr125 ; and Al Edrissi130 places it on the road from Mecca to Yemen. This appears to be the very route by Avhich Gallus was advancing; and Najeran, by the Arabian accounts, Avas capable of affording the supplies of Avhich the army stood in need. I am myself therefore per- suaded, that Gallus entered the country of the MincJans, and that the city he assaulted, whether Mariaba, Marsdaba, or Caripeta, was the capital of that province ; for Mariaba implies a capital in general ; and if Ilasar is the king of this tribe, whether Calingii, Rhamanit\u00e6, or Elesari, I would comprehend all three under the title of Mineans. At least, to my concep- tion it is clear, that Ptolemy, Pliny, and Strabo, all point to something farther south than Mecca. Whether this opinion will meet with the approbation of others, is dubious ; such as the obscurity and contradiction of my authorities will alloAV, I give it. If Najeran be a fixed point, and concluded, avc have ground to stand on ; if it can be disputed, I am readjr to embrace any assumption that may from the expression of Al Edrissi, I conclude it lies farther_east than d'Anville has placed it. But even if d'Anville is right, Al Nokra is upwards of 200 miles out of the road that Gallus appears to have taken.

Gossellin concludes, that the Rhamanit\u00e6 of Strabo are the Manit\u00e6 of Ptolemy : it is the strength of his argument ; and in Mercator's Map, the Manit\u00e6 are placed on the north of Mecca. But perhaps Mercator is misled, for we have no latitude of the Manit\u00e6 ; and the text says, below the Manit\u00e6 ? is the interior Myrrh country, and then the Mineans, a great nation. I have not yet met with any account of myrrh in Hejaz, and therefore, if the Rhamanit\u00e6 and Manit\u00e6 are the same, I conclude that they are in Yemen. But the Avhole of this is conjectural ; and, if names avail, I might Avith equal propriety contend, that Rhaman is Haman, or Hamdan, the tribe converted by Ali, the position of which answers ; or assert, that Cari-Peta is Carni-Peta, correspondent to the Carna nz or Carana of Strabo, Avhich he says Avas the capital of the Mineans.

Najeran \"* itself is in Hejaz, for it is one of the fortresses ot Mecca, according to Al Edrissi ; and the boundary of this pro vince and Yemen, is fixed at the following station.

This seems a great exertion for sixty135 days continuance; but famine im pended, and doubtless the Arabs hovered in thereat; add to this, that Avhen the army arrived in Egypt it Avas completely ruined, as Strabo informs us, by famine, hardship, sickness, and the difficulties of the march.

We are now to return to the coast, on which, as has been already noticed, the Periplus mentions only the Canraites, Burnt Island, Moosa, and Ok\u0153iis. The Canraites are the wild tribes on the broken shore of the Hejaz, terminating about Hassan Isle, in lat. 25\u00b0. And the passage from Leuke.

The first distance is 834 miles English, the latter 62,5 ; both presenting a course far too long for any ancient vessel to perform without com ing to an anchor.

He had fixed the seat of his government at Aphar, supposed by Gossellin to be the same as Dafar or Safar ; and Dafar is noticed by Niebuhr as a place near Mount Sumara, now in ruins. The distance, however, docs not answer ; for Aphar is placed by the Periplus thirteen days inland from Save, and Save three clays from Moosa. But if Save is the same as Taas, or Mount Sabber, the distance from Sabber to Dafar is not much more than from Moosa to Sabber ; and thirteen days from Sabber inland would carry us much nearer to Sana, the modern capital of the Imam, and the metropolis of Yemen. It is possible, that in a country subject to perpetual revolu tions, provinces may have obtained different names from the tribes that occupied different situations: this seems apparent in the district of Cataba, which is now inland sixty miles from the coast, notwithstanding that Strabo places the Catabanians immediately at the straits. It may be, therefore, presumption to say, that Save is Sabber Ui, or Aphar, Dafar ; notwithstand ing that the territory of Maphartis144 at Save, or the capital of thsTIomerites thirteen days inland, may afford us general in formation sufficiently correct. .

Herodotus is much more moderate; and mentions only that Sesostris commenced his expedition from the Gulph of Arabia, and subdued the nations bordering on the Erythr\u0153an Sea, till he met with shoals l64, which opposed the farther pro gress of his fleet. 5 But as avc are now arrived at the straits, I shall introduce a table comprizing the most material authorities of the ancients, ,&1 Having passed the strait, it is necessary Oriental Navigator, p. 152.\u2014 N.

Few other historical documents, however, of the fact appear, farther than may be collected from the circumstances here recorded, and these are both few and deficient. To what extent the passage of the straits, and progressively, the voyage to India, were accomplished, has been already suf ficiently shewn; but that it was always considered as a most extraordinary attempt by all those who had not personally made it, we want no other testimony than that of Arrian, the his torian of Alexander.

The first place to which we are directed beyond the straits, is a village called Arabia Felix : its distance is estimated at an hundred and twenty miles from Okelis; and it was formerly a city of importance before ,7i the fleets passed from India to Egypt, or from Egypt to the countries towards the East'7'. Previous to that time, the fleets from Egypt and the East met in this harbour, which was the centre of the commerce, as Alexandria was afterwards for all that passed through Egypt into the Mediterranean. Upon this occasion the language of the Periplus is very precise, and in perfect harmony with the account of Agatharchides. \" It received its name of (Eudai \" mon) rich and flourishing, from the circumstance of the ships \" from Egypt and India meeting there, before the merchants \" of Egypt dared ,74 to venture farther towards the marts in the \" East.\" For this purpose this harbour was more particularly convenient, as it afforded better anchorage, and was more com modious for procuring water than Okelis.

Every circumstance in this minute description directs us to Aden: the distance, the harbour, and the name175, all cor respond ; and the peculiarity of its being under Charibael, while Okelis was possessed by Cholebus, marks the extent of the Homerite dominions, surrounding Maphartis in the angle of the peninsula. The native sheiks, or heads of tribes, at the present day, are perfect representatives of Cholebus. When Niebuhr was in Arabia, the sheik of Aden was no longer subject to the Imam of Sana, but had asserted his independence, and pos sessed a small territory in the neighbourhood of the city. The capture also and destruction of this village by the Ro mans, a short time previous to the author's age, would be a natural consequence of the progress and extension of the Ro man commerce from the Red Sea to India ; and, as Claudius collected a tribute from the maritime towns of Arabia, it is natural to suppose that he was the Cesar mentioned in the Peri plus, who ordered this place to be destroyed, for the purpose of suppressing every power that might interfere with the Roman commerce, or divert a share of it into its ancient channel.

It was the same system of policy which induced_ Soliman, emperor of the Turks, to send Soliman Pacha from the Red Sea to suppress the rising power of the Portuguese in India; when, under pretence of delivering: the Mahomedan powers from this new and unex pected intrusion of the Christians, he employed the forces which had been collected on the occasion in seizing on the maritime towns of Arabia. It was then that Soliman Pacha obtained possession of Aden by treachery, and hanged the sheik at the yard-arm of his ship176. I conjecture that it was Aden which Agatharchides describes without a name, when he places a city on his White Sea with out the straits; from whence, he says, the Sab\u0153ans sent out colonies or factories into India, and 'where the fleets from Persis, Karmania, and the Indus, arrived. He specifies large ,7? ships employed for this purpose; and though his mention of islands may suggest an idea of Socotra, Curia Muria, and the coast of Oman, it seems far more probable that his intelligence was imperfect, and that these fleets, which he describes, must have been found in the same port which the Periplils assigns them, as long as the monopoly continued in the hands of the Sabeans. The testimony of Agatharchides is, in one point, highly im portant ; for it is the first historical evidence to prove the establishment of Arabian colonists, or rather resident factors 1,6 viagg'0 di un comito Venetiano.

The settlement of their own agents in the country was most convenient and profitable, while the manners and religion of India created no obstacle to the system. In the middle ages, when the power of the Romans was ex tinguished, and the Mahomedans were possessed of Egypt, Aden resumed its rank as the centre of the trade between India and the Red Sea. The ships which came from the East were large, like those which Agatharchides describes : they did not pass the straits, but landed their cargoes at this port, where the trankies 17S or germes of the Arabs, which brought the pro duce of Europe, Syria, and Egypt, received the precious com modities of the East, and conveyed them either to Assab, Kosir, or Jidda ; when all that passed into Europe, still came to Alexandria, and enriched the Soldan's dominions by the duties levied, and the profits of the transit. In this situation, Marco Polo found Aden179 in the thirteenth century; and the account he gives of the wealth, power, and influence of Aden, is almost as magnificent as that which Agatharchides attributed to the Sabeans in the time of the Ptolemies, when the trade was carried on in the same manner.

If we should now refer to that plan, and place the town of Arabia Felix on the western, instead of the eastern point of the peninsula, where Aden now stands, it would lie at the entrance of the harbour, as it is described in the PeriplAs. The nar rowness of the neck includes the difficulty of approach from the main, and the distance from the straits answers within the difference of five miles. Much praise is due to every officer who publishes the result of his own experience, not only on account of the service which may accrue to navigation in future, but likewise as it contributes to remove former errors, and to promote the interests of science universally. In the present instance, I have the satisfaction to find that the mer chant of the Periplus, as- well as Nearchus, is proved to be more conformable to truth, in proportion to our attainment of a more minute and accurate knowledge of the local. I could have wished for the same advantage in my farther progress to the East; but upon the remainder of this extensive coast, from Aden to the Gulph of Persia, there will be few positions in the following detail which will accord with d'Anville's arrangement, or with that of other commentators who have bestowed their. attention upon the Periplus."], [375, "ARABIA. 331 XII. ARRANGEMENT OF THE COAST OF ARABIA ON THE OCEAN. The circumstance upon which the whole depends, is the adjustment of Suagros. In common with others, I had sup posed its representative to be the modern Ras-el-had ; and there is so much to induce this opinion, that I abandoned it with reluctance, and shall perhaps find great difficulty in persuading others that it is erroneous. The Periplus notices Suagros as pointing to the East, and as the greatest promontory in the world. Omana likewise is mentioned with it, answering to the present Oman ; and Moscha, seemingly identified with Maskat, the principal port of that province. Under the influence of these resemblances and probabilities, if I had joined in the common suffrage, and called Suagros Ras-el-had in my former publications, wherever it occurred, it is conviction alone, and the abandonment of system for truth, which compels me to recall the error, and acknowledge180 that Suagros is not Ras-el-had, but Fartaque. This is a concession not made for the purpose of particular accommodation, but grounded on a general analysis of all the positions on the coast, on a combination of all the circum stances relative to the division of the provinces ; and upon a painful re-consideration of all that was to be undone, and un settled, after I had fixed my opinions upon the authority of the best writers, who had preceded me on the subject. ,s\u00b0 I find that De Castro is of the same opinion.

The reader will expect proofs ; and the proofs are, that the islands IWmd the whole extent of the coast on the ocean will now fall naturally into their places, which cannot be effected by any other arrangement. The islands in Ptolemy will become relatively consistent with those of the Periplus; and the Bay Sachalites, which Ptolemy has been accused of transposing from the west to the east of Suagros, is reduced to the dif ferent application of a name, instead of a difference in point of situation. Sachalites is universally allowed to be the Greek form of expressing the Arabick Sahar ,8\\ Now there are two Sahars on the coast of Arabia : one that is almost centrical between Aden and Fartaque ; and another that lies to the east of Fartaqnc, between that cape and Cape Morebat or Merbat X In the first183 of these there is little variation of orthography ; but the other is written Sch\u0153hr, SchahrX Shahar, Cheer l3s, and Seger. 181 Sahar becomes Sachar by enforcing the sound of the aspirate, and the change of the final r is analogous in a variety of instances : thus, Degel, formed into Deger, is the river Tigris of the Greeks ; and Sinus Sachal-ites is equivalent to Sachar-ites, the bay of Sachar or Sahar. taque, and the Ulterior to the eastward of it ; the first would be the Sachalites of the Peri. plus, and the latter the Sachalites of Ptolemy ; and respectively, the Hadramaut and Seger of Al Edrissi.

See Al Edrissi, p. 27. 182 Cape Merbat, called Morebat and Mara bout in our charts, is a headland much no ticed by our English navigators : it is one of the principal sources of frankincense ; for Al Edrissi says, in montibus Merbat nascuntur arbores thuris quod deinde in omnes Orientis et Occidentis partes defertur. It is four days, or an hundred miles, from Hasec, and conse quently in the very heart of the district, which is the Sachalites of Ptolemy.

Further proofs of this reconciliation will be given in our pro gress along the coast, and some difficulties that attend it will be acknowledged ; but if it should be admissible or probable upon the whole, much indulgence is clue in regard to inferior objections ; as, upon the first view of the coast before us, no two accounts can seem more irreconcileable to each other than those of Ptolemy and the Periplfts.

Our charts take notice of both, and at Cava Canim ,37, which is inserted principally upon the authority of d'Anville, there appear some islets, which may be Ornedn ,88 and Troolla, described as desert isles by the Periplus ; and which, if they exist, identify Cava Canim for Kane, in preference to Maculla. In point of distance, either is sufficiently exact to answer the purpose ; for Maculla is sixty \"' leagues from Aden, and Cava Canim eight or ten miles short of that bay. Kane is represented as a port of considerable trade, subject to Eleasus, kino- of the Incense countrv, who resided at Sab batha, the principal city of the district, which lies at some dis tance inland. At Kane is collected all the incense that is pro duced in the country, and which is conveyed hither both by land and sea, either by means of caravans, or in the vessels of the country, which are floats supported upon inflated skins\"*. Sabbatha is supposed by most of the commentators to be Schibam or Scebam, which Al Edrissi places in Hadramaut, iit four stations, or an hundred miles, from Mareb : a certain proof that we have adopted the right Sahar for the Periplus; because Mareb must be more than three hundred miles distant from the Eastern Sahar, or Seger ; and Seger is not considered by Al Edrissi as a part '\" of Hadramaut, but as a separate .district. 187 In Sanson I find the name of Cava Canim first mentioned, where he has a bay and islands ; but as Sanson was well acquainted with the Periplus, whether he placed them there out of respect to that authority, or had any other, I .cannot discover.

To maintain that these are the three general divisions of Arabia on the Indian Ocean, is consonant to all the evidence we have, ancient and modern ; neither do independent districts or sheiks, as those of Keschin, Seger, or Mahra, interfere with this distribution. And that wre are equally correct in assigning the Western Sahar to Hadra maut, is capable of proof; for Al Edrissi says, from Aden to Hadramaut, which lies to the east of Aden, are five192 stations. If therefore we observe, that at Kane we are already two hun dred miles east of Aden, we are advanced far enough to shew that we are in Hadramaut193, and that the Western Sahar is properly placed in that province.

And first200, that it points to the east is true; but it is not true that it is the largest promontory in the world ; for Ras-el had, on the same coast, is larger. But it is more conspicuous, and was of more importance, probably, in the author's view, as forming the great entrance to the Gulph of Arabia, in con junction with Cape Aromata on the coast of Africa ; and as such, it is still the point of more immediate consequence in V very similar to those of the Periplii. : the pro duce of incense, the monopoly of the sovereign, palm trees, Icthuophagi, &c.

A second proof is, that Socotra is said to lie between this cape and Aromata ; which, in one respect, is true, and cannot be applied to Ras-el-had. And a third is, that the islands of Curia Muria, and Mazeira, are to the east of this cape, as they really lie; while, if Suagros were fixed at Ras-el-had, the islands must lie on the west of the Cape, directly transposed from their real position to an erroneous one. But of this we shall treat in its place. We must now return to Sahar, which is considered in the Periplus as the heart of the Incense country, and the Incense country is Hadramaut. Hadramaut is the Hatzar-mavcth of Genesis, which signi fies 2t\" in Hebrew, the Court of Death; and in Arabick, the Region of Death ; both names perfectly appropriate, according to the testimony of the Peripltis, which informs us, \" that the \" incense is collected by the king's slaves, or by malefactors \" condemned to this service as a punishment. The country is \" unhealthy 202 in the extreme ; pestilential even to those who '* sail along the coast, and mortal to the wretched sufferers em \" ployed in collecting the frankincense ; who perish likewise \" as often by want [and neglect] as by the pernicious influence \" of the climate.

He"], [383, "1 ARABIA. 339 \" the trees that bear the incense ; the tree itself is small and \" low, from the bark of which the incense MJ exudes, as gum \" does from several of our\u21224 trees in Egypt.\" The conveyance of this drug by land, Pliny informs us, was through Thomna, the capital of the Gebanites, to Gaza on the coast of Palestine, by a caravan that was sixty-two days in its progress; and that the length of this journey, with the duties, frauds, and impositions on it, brought every camel's load to upwards of two-and-twenty pounds, English ; and a pound of the best sort at Rome, to more than ten shillings. The course of this convej'ance is not easy to comprehend105; for if the commodity passed by a caravan, the Mineans were centrical, and the usual carriers from Gerrha on the Gulph of Persia, as well as from Hadramaut and Sab6a, to Petra in Idumea. But we must not understand this as excluding the conveyance of the incense to Alexandria by the Red Sea ; for that city was the great repository of this, as well as all the other produce of India and Arabia. Pliny206 mentions this particularly, and *\u25a0* It has been observed already from Nie buhr, that the best incense is now procured from India, by far more clear, white, and pure, than the Arabian ; and it is a circum stance well worth inquiry, whether the col lection of this gum is attended with the same fatal effects in that country as are here de scribed ; and whether the consequences are Ueducible from the drug itself, or from the nature of the country. Those who are de sirous of learning more than is here remarked on this subject, may consult Pliny, lib. 12. c. 14. and Salmasius, 4>S6, ct seq. of a man who merely wrote upon the subject, but of one who had vis'ted the country, and painted what he saw, aos Bochart place3 Thomna between Sab batha and Mariaba, and supposes the Katabeni and Gebanit\u00e6 to be the same people ; which they are ; for Pliny makes Ocila ( Okelis) a port of the Gebanites, xii. ij. : but if so, it is the territory of Maphartis he must place them in ; and they would not move by cara vans, but by sea. Strabo makes Tamna the capital of the Katabeni, p. 768 ; and his Katabeni are not between Sabbat I a and Mariaba, but in the territory of Ma phartis. 3a* \"V.; Ti-ia sia\\ tl?v vaf' s'.jj.'., ii 'Atyi/irra hi-S-xv.

The Periplds doe's not advert to any particular spot in this bay, or specify any town of Sachal; but, after relating the cir cumstances as they are here stated, proceeds directly to Sua gros. Suagros, or the Wild Boar, would naturally^induce a persuasion that it was a nautical appellation, like the Ram Plead207, Dun Nose, &c. ; but it is far more probable that, like Phenik6n in the Red Sea, it is derived from the palm-trees observed there, of a particular species, called Suagros; they are of a superior sort203, as Pliny informs us, with large fruit, hard, and rough in appearance, and with a high relish of the flavour of wild boar. What this flavour is, we may leave to the naturalists to determine; but the allusion to Suagros is mani fest; and that the Cape takes its name from its produce, is a natural conclusion. That this promontory is actually Cape Fartaque, cannot be doubted, if we now advert to the parti culars connected with it ; for we are told, that the island of Dioskorida lies between this point and Cape Aromata, or Gar defan, on the coast of Africa ; that it is at a considerable dis tance in the open sea, but nearer to Suagros than to the Cape opposite; and that it is a large island, far exceeding all the others that appertain to the coast of Arabia. Now although this account is not strictly accurate, for So cotra is not actually between the two capes, but forms a ter minating jpoint to Cape Gardefan, like our Scilly Islands to the \"\u00bb So K,=i3 pETilwo. in Crete. ferme in apris novimus.

The most transient reference to the map will at least prove, that none of these circumstances can be applied to Ras-el-had ; for that cape lies almost seven hundred miles farther to the north-east, and can hardly be said, in any sense, to be opposite to Gardefan, unless by drawing a line of such extreme obliquity, as would never occur to the mind of a mariner under the idea of an opposite promontory ; but Cape Fartaque is constantly contrasted with Gardefan in modern geography, as Suagros is placed opposite to Aromata in the Periplus. XV. DIOSCORIDA, OR SOCOTRA. Dioscorida, Dioscorides, Dioscftrias, or Dioscora, may have a Greek origin, but it has so near a resemblance to So cotra \"* or Zocotora, that it is much more likely to be a nauti cal corruption of an Arabick term, than the application of a Greek one. This island is near an hundred miles long, and thirty at its greatest breadth : it was inhabited only on the northern 21\u00b0 side 509 See a full account of Socotra, and its produce of aloes and gum dragon, in Purchas, vol. i. p. 417, et seq. ; and a drawing of it in Astley [i.e. Green), and Mclchiz.

Marco Polo informs us, that in his time the inhabitants were Chris tians ; and Al Edrissi confirms this, with the addition, that the Greeks were introduced there by Alexander2\", at the request of Aristotle2'2, in hopes of obtaining aloes, the principal pro duce of the island, and of the best quality that is known. Now it is remarkable, that aloes are not mentioned by the author of the Periplvis ; but he notices particularly the drug called Indian2'1 cinnabar, which exudes from a certain species of trees, and tortoise-shell, of the largest size and best sort ; add ing, that there is likewise the mountain or land-tortoise, which has the lower shell of a ruddy yellow, and too hard to be cut ; vernment.

In the author's age, this island was subject to Ele&zus, the king of Sabbatha, who set the revenue to farm2\", but main tained a garrison for the purpose of securing his receipts and supporting his authority. This fact is similar to what we had; occasion to notice on the coast of Africa, where several of the ports in Azania (or Ajan) were subject to Charibael and Chole bus, whose territories were in Yemen ; Niebuhr informs us, that Socotra is at this day subject to the sheik of Keschin, who has considerable possessions in Hadramaut ; and Keschin, \"* Al Edrissi, speaking of the tortoise-shell at Curia Muria, says, dorsa testudinum ex quibus conficiunt sibi incol\u00e6 Iaman paropsides ad lavandiim & pinsendum.

The consistency of these circumstances in the ancient and modern accounts, may induce a persuasion that we have traced out our way so far with certainty and precision ; the next step we are to advance, is the only one on the whole coast, which will raise a doubt, and which has certainly been the source of the general opinion embraced by modern 2lS geographers, thaj Suagros is not Fartaque, but Ras-el-had. XVI. MOSKHA AND OMANA. I shall state this circumstance in the very words of the author; for he says, \"Adjoining to Suagros there is a bay \" which runs2\" deep into the main land [of] O'mana, six hun \" dred stadia in width; after this there are high mountainous \" rocks steep to, and inhabited by a [wild] race, that live in \" caverns and hollows of the cliff.

I cannot account for this coincidence ; but I do not think that Moskha is Maskat, because Maskat is beyond C. Ras-el-had ; and I shall shew immediately, by the islands which succeed Moskha, that we are not yet arrived at Ras-el-had by four hundred miles. Neither will the Moskha of Ptolemy solve the diffi culty ; for he carries it farther back than the Peri phis, and has placed it to the westward of Suagros, which is Ids Fartaque like wise, as well as the Fartaque of our author. The mention of O'mana here is still more unaccountable : but I wras in hopes to have reconciled it by means of a river O'rmanus, or Hormanus, which Ptolemy has in his Bay Sachalites, and which he brings down from a place called O'mana. This, however, is not to be depended upon ; for his map is so distorted on this part of the coast, that it leaves the whole matter in uncertainty. One circumstance only can be deduced from it ; which is, that his Ormanus and O'mana are both to the westward of Ras-el-had, as well as the O'mana and Moskha of the Periplus : the proof of which is, that they both precede his Korodamon, and Kor6damon must be the repre sentative of Ras-el-had, as it is his extreme point east of the whole peninsula. There are no data for placing the Moskha of the Periplus, but the distance of eleven hundred stadia from Suagros ; and this measure brings it nearer to Seger, the Sachalites of Pto lemy, the Sch\u0153hr of the moderns, than any other place it can be referred to. At Moskha, the mention of the Bay Sa- vol. ir. Y y"], [390, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 346 chalites 212 is again introduced by the Periplus ; for the author informs us, that throughout the whole extent of that bay, in every port, the incense lies in piles without a guard223 to protect it, as if it were indebted to some divine power for its security. Neither is it possible to obtain a cargo, either publicly or by connivance, without permission of the king. Nay, if a single grain were embarked clandestinely, good fortune indeed must the merchant have who could escape with his vessel from the harbour. At Moskha there is a regular intercourse by sea with Kank ; and such vessels as come from Limurike224 and Barugaza, too late in the season, and are obliged to pass the adverse monsoon in this port, treat with the king's officers to obtain frankincense in exchange for .their muslins, corn, and oil225. If it should now be asked, whether I am myself satisfied with the account here given of O'mana and Moskha, I could not answer in the affirmative. These two names certainly throw a shade of obscurity and difficulty over the arrangment of the coast; and if this barren subject should be reviewed by a future commentator, much pleasure would it be to see those obstacles removed, which I have not been so fortunate as to surmount. Still that, upon the whole, the assumption of Fartaque for Suagros is right, depends upon proofs now to be produced, M This has an appearance as if the author had two bays of the same title, as Al Edrissi has, that is, a Sachar prior and ulterior ; but there is no other proof that this distinction is ancient. off from the edge of depredation. Bars of silver lie apparently without a guard in the streets of Panama ; but in Seger, besides the protection of the gods, the sheik seems to keep good watch, if a single grain cannot be got off till the duty is paid.

XVII. ISLANDS OF ZENOBIUS, OR CURIA MURIA. At fifteen hundred stadia distance from Moskha, which I have supposed to be Seger ; and at the termination of the dis trict called Asikho, there are seven islands, almost in a line, called the Islands of Zenobius. Now the distance answers to make these the islands in the Bay of Curia Muria ; and it is to these islands that the Arabian fable of two islands, inhabited one by men, and the other by women, applies. In Oriental geograph}', they are placed at a great distance to the south; but the origin of the fable is on the coast, and truly Arabian. Al Edrissi calls them Chartan\"6 Martan ; and though he says they are only four, and four only they appear on our charts, it is conclusive in their favour, that he styles the bay Giun-al- Hascisc227; for Hasek (the Asikho of the Peri pi As) is the prin cipal town in the bay at the present hour. Hasec223 Al Edrissi calls it himself in another place, where he mentions only two 225 Bochart says, that by a change of the points, he reads Curian Murian for the Char tan Martan of Al Edrissi. See Stuckius. on floats supported on inflated skins ; but this is giving a Greek derivation of an Arabick name. Bochart conjectures, with much more probability, that they are the inhabitants of Hasek ; and that Ptolemy's M\u00e6phat is a corruption of Merbat, as it is written in Al Edrissi, the C. Morebat of our charts, Pha leg. 106. \"7 Sinus Herbarum, Al Edrissi, p. 22. \u2014 P. 27. he makes Hasec the city, and Al Hascisc the bay ; but are they not the same name ? \"\" Here Ptolemy places theAscit\u00e6, whose same he derives from da-xo,, because they sail Y Y 2"], [392, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 348 islands, as Chartan and Martan ; and says, it is a small city, but populous, and the bay deep and dangerous. The four islands have now obtained the names of IJalki, Sordi, Halabi, and Deriabi ; to which Captain Bissell adds a fifth, called Redondo (p. 25.): perhaps rocks and islets make them seven ; for seven they are in Ptolemy also, placed in the same relative situation between Fartaque and Ras-el-had, though not correct in their vicinity to the coast. XVIII. SARAPIS, OR MAZEIRA. s Froji Hasec, or Asikho, we have, first, a tract inhabited by a barbarous tribe229, not subject to Arabia but Persis 2'\u00b0 ; and at the distance of two thousand stadia from the Islands of Zeno bius, another island called Sar&pis. Sarapis, it is added, is an hundred and twenty stadia from the coast, two hundred stadia in breadth, and contains three villages, inhabited by priests, or recluses, of the lethuophagi, who speak the Arabick language, and wear girdles or aprons made of the fibres of the cocoa 2JI.

It must therefore lie between these two points, and pre cisely ascertain, that we are past the one, and not yet arrived at the other; and likewise, that the isles of Zenobius must, by their distance and relative situation, be the Curia Muria of the present clay, notwithstanding their disagreement in point of number. Mazeira is well known to modern navigators : its size and situation are sufficiently ascertained, and there is a channel232 between the island and the main, through which English ships have passed. D'Anville has supposed tiiat Sardpis is the same as Mazeira, without considering that if it be so, it is to the west of Ras-el-had, and that therefore his Suagros, which is fixed at Ras-el-had, cannot be correct.

In assuming these islands for those of Kalaius, there can be no error, for the language of our author is precise : he says, that as you are now approaching the\" Gulph of Persia/ keeping close255 round the coast, you change the direction of your course to the north. This is literally true at Ras-el-had, and no where else on the coast ; for Ras-el-had is the extreme point east of all Arabia, as Korodamon is in Ptolemy : and if I had found that the monsoon was divided by this cape, as it is by Gardefan, I should have sought for an etymology in Greek I imagine that \u25a0z-aeirafj.;]ix4 wi x^K- cannot be rendered better than by describing the islands as \" lying in a range.\" Perhaps it should be read is-x%xrna\\j.'iya\\. ; and this is the precise distinction of M'Cluer. tStS* may be read either with us avi-r,y tulh \"Agxrot, or with WEf 1 t\u00bb\\ iKrGoXr.y, \" as you are just approaching the Gulph of Persia lie islands ;\" and I place a comma at oiay^xias, in order to make it express the distance from Sarapis : but if it be joined with the final clause, it must be rendered, \" the Islands of Kalaius, which lie in a range \" two thousand stadia 'along the coast.\" This is not true ; neither can we 6tretch the seven leagues of M'Cluer, or one-and-twenty miles to two hundred. Uiciv.oXirifyn-i, signifies lite rally, to keep close to the shore, to follow the windings of the shore. But whatever doubt there may be concerning the contents of the whole passage, nothing can be more plain than this one circumstance, that the course of the voyage is changed here to the NORTH, and this particular can be true only at Ras-el-had. This is the truth we have been searching for, and I think the proof is conclusive. *\u00bb\u2666, Oriental Navigator, p. 181. 175. 177. ,3S ITEfiitoXs-i^ovTi & r-r.y Ixpiiinm im'fov, si; dvi-r,y rr,y APKTON r.ln BTSfl rfo UoSoXr.y t\u00abc Ui( c-ixriS SaXdo-o-*:, xeTvtoh vww nXiljj.'.ya,, [yrXtions, Stuckius.] KaXaia Xiyofj.'.yai yr.o-o,, c-j^So* tirl ratine iurxitim i:a^yafj.iya, tj xht' Thus rendered by Hudson : In sinu autem vicin\u00e6 continentis, ad sep tentriones, prope ostium maris Persici insulae iacent, ad quas navigatur, Cal\u00e6i insul\u00e6 dict\u00e6, qu\u00e6 fere bis mille stadiorum intervallo a con tinente sunt disjunct\u00e6.

But the character of the cape itself is distinct, for as \"soon as you are past it, the coast falls back again to the north-west. If we could reckon the two thousand stadia from the point where this alteration of the course takes place, that is, from Ras-el had, the distance also would correspond. But the mention of these islands is another irrefragable proof that we are correct in fixing Suagros at Fartaque, and Koroda- mon at Ras-el-had ; for the appellation of Kal\u00e6u is preserved in Pliny (lib. vi. 32.), and Cape Kalaiat still appears in our modern charts, immediately after passing Ras-el-had. The Oriental Navigator says it is not a cape, though it has obtained the name ; but a cape it is called by d'Anville, d'Apres, and Capt. Bissell, with a town and river of the same name. It is written Kalgat. Coliat, Coriat, but Cqelhat by Al Edrissi ; and though it is at a considerable distance from the Suadi Islands, there can be little doubt of its relation to them, as there is no such cluster of islands except this on the coast. But if this relation should be questioned, the mention of Kalaiou, with the change of the course to the north, marks Ras-el-had to a certainty, which is the great object in view. The modern name of these islands, Suadi, is a corruption, by means of Swardi, from Suhardi or Sohardi ; and Sohar, the Tsur of Al Edrissi, is the place on the continent near which they lie. After establishing these several points, if we should review the whole course from Fartaque to Ras-el-had, there is nothing to interfere with the general statement, except the mention of O'mana and Moskha; and no single circumstance ought to"], [396, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 352 stand in competition with the whole. At the distance of eighteen hundred years, it is difficult to say whether the ob scurity lies with us, or the author; one should rather acquit the author, who is so correct in other respects, and look for a solution from some future lights, which may appear, either from a more correct knowledge of the coast, or from some better read ings of the commentators, considering that the copy which we have is certainly defective, and that no manuscripts are to be expected. The natives, on the main opposite to these islands, are said to be treacherous, and their vision to be defective during the light of the day : what the latter circumstance may allude to, it is not material to inquire, but their treachery is natural if they are Bedouin Arabs, as Lieut. Porter236 says they were in his time at Sohar, and not civilized in their behaviour to the people of his boat. XX. ISLANDS OF PAPIAS. We have now the Islands of Papias, and the Fair Mountain, with the entrance of the Persian Gulph : for the first, we must look to two or three small islands on the coast, beyond Sohar237, towards the north ; and at the last of these the Journal places the Fair Mountain, which would answer sufficiently to Cape Fillam, if that be high land ; and not far from Fillam are the Slraits. \"6 Ori^nul Navigator, p. 177. once the seat of the China trade, antecedent a\" Sohar, according to Al Edrissi, was to the establishment of it at Keish."], [397, "ARABIA. 353 > It is not impossible, however, that the. Islands of Papias may be the Coins, which lie immediately off the entrance of the gulph ; for, in a letter of Lieut. M'Cluer to Mr. Dalrymple, he writes, \" the Great Coin .... lies in lat. 26\u00b0 30' 0\" north . . . . \" and there are four other islands between this and Cape Mus \" seldom, all of them smaller than the Great Coin, and none \" of them inhabited .... Besides these, there are seven others \" close in, which are not easily distinguished from the Arabian \" shore.\" But if these islands are within Mocandon, they do not. correspond with those of the Periplus, for which I find no sufficient representatives, except in Green's 23i Map of Arabia ; but his authority does not appear. XXI. SABO, ASABO, OR MOCANDON. It is well known that Mocandon is represented in Ptolenry by the black mountains called Asabo, the promontory of the Asabi ; and that Sabo signifies South, designating, as it should seem, in the mind of Arabian navigators, the extreme point south of the Gulph of Persia. A tribe is also noticed in the neighbourhood, which is called Mac\u00e6 both by Ptolemy arid Arrian ; and in Mac\u00e6 we obtain probably the rudiments of Mocandon which we have from the Portuguese. But the Orientalists give a different etymology, and inform us, that Mo-salem is the Cape of Congratulation. nt See Astley's (Green's) Map of Arabia, at the end of Vol, I. I. Z Z VOL. II."], [398, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 354 Mocandon is of vast height, and frightful appearance ; it forms, with Mount239 Ehowrs, or Elbours240, on the opposite shore, the entrance to the gulph, which is near forty miles broad, estimated at sixty in the Periplils ; and Elbours is called the Round Mountain of Semiramis : it is round in fact, and has its modern name of Elbours from its supposed resemblance to the Fire Towers of the Guebres or Parsees. Mocandon is a sort of Lizard point to the gulph ; for all the Arabian ships take their departure from it, with some cere monies of superstition, imploring a blessing on their voyage, and setting afloat a toy, like a vessel rigged and decorated, which, if it is dashed to pieces by the rocks, is to be accepted by the Ocean as an offering for the escape of the vessel. Whether the author himself passed this cape, and entered the gulph, is very dubious ; from the manner of the narration, I should conclude he never passed the straits ; for he mentions only two particulars in the whole of the gulph, and then introduces the passage across the open sea from Arabia to Karmania. XXII. TEREDON, APOLOGUS, OR OBOLRH. \u2022 But the two particulars noticed are remarkable : the one is the Pearl Fishery, which extends on the bank great part of the way from Mocandon to Bahrain ; and the other is the situation 1 ** These two mountains opposite, are the ten in Cutler, is the nautical enunciation of Owair and Kosair of Al Edrissi, p. 4. the Arabick Owair ; and Owair is the limit 540 El-Bours signifies a fire tower of the of the Gulph of Persia on the Karmanian side, Parsees, and the mountain is round, like an in Al Edrissi object of that sort ; but Ehowrs, as it is writ- 7"], [399, "ARABIA. 355 of a town called Apologus, at the head of the gulph on the Euphrates, and opposite the Fort of Pasinus or Spasinus. There can be no hesitation in adopting the opinion of d'Anville, that Apologus is Oboleh, upon the canal that leads from the Euphrates to Basra ; for Oboleh is situated, according to Al Edrissi 241, at the angle between the canal and the river ; and he adds, that the canal covers it on the north, and the river on the east; consequently, this is as nearly opposite to the Fort of Pasinus, as the canal is to the Haffar River, which communi cates with all the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates. Apologus is Greek in its external form, but much more properly deduced, as d'Anville observes, from Oboleh, which, with the strong Oriental aspirate, becomes Obolehh or Oboiegh. We may consequently assume this for a proof of its existence as a place of commerce at so early a period, when it had probably taken place of Teredon or Diridotis, as Basra took place. of Oboleh under the second Caliphate 242 of the Mahomedans ; but that Oboleh continued a mart of consideration long after the building of Basra243, we may be assured by Al Edrissi's making it the termination of the gulph, as well as the Periplus; and Oboleh, or a village that represents it, still exists between Basra and the Euphrates ; the canal also is called the Canal of Oboleh. **' P. 121.

The Babylonians, who commanded the river from the gulph to the capital, doubtless made use of it as the channel of Oriental commerce ; and the traffick which had passed by Arabia, or by the Red Sea, through Idumea, to Egypt, Tyre, and other places on the Mediterranean, was diverted by Nebuchadnezzar, after the destruction of Tyre, to the Persian Gulph; and through his territories in Mesopotamia, by Palmy'ra and Da mascus, it passed through Syria to the West. After the con quest of Babylon by Cyrus, the Persians, who were neither navigators to the East, nor attentive to their frontier on the West, suffered Babylon, Nineveh, and Opis, to sink into ruin ; the course of trade, therefore, returned to Arabia on the south, to the Caspian 24i and Euxine on the north : Idumea became again the resort of the caravans ; and Tyre rose out of its ashes, till its power eiwbled it to maintain a siege of eio-ht months against Alexander, in the career of bis victories. ,44 Diony'sius is said to be the versifier of Eratosthenes's Geography; if so, it is not qmte a proof that it did .xist in his time. \"4S See Strabo, p.^09.

What views this conqueror had after his first victories, we can only conjecture ; but after his return from India, we may be assured that his comprehensive mind had embraced all that vast system which was afterwards completed at Alexandria. His successors, the Ptolemies in Egypt, and the Seleucid\u00e6 in Syria, were rivals in this commerce; Palmy'ra, Damascus, Antioch, and Edessa, all lie on the line of the caravans from the Persian Gulph ; the Caspian and the Euxine were again frequented, and the commerce on this side enriched the king- doms246 of Prttsias, A'ttalus, and Mithridates; while the navi gation on the Indian Ocean, built upon the same foundation, made Alexandria the first commercial city of the world.

But it seems to have existed in the time of Herodotus, who mentions the trade on the Euxine conducted by interpreters of seven different languages : in the time of Mithridates, .500 different nations met at Dioscurias in Colchis ; and, in the early time of the Roman power in that country, there were 130 interpreters of the languages used there ; but now, says Pliny, the city is deserted ; that is, in Pliny's age, the Romans would not suffer the Parthians, or any of the northern nations, to traffic iby the Euxine, but confined the whole trade to Alexandria, and the maritime intercourse with India. See Herodotus, lib. i\\\\ and Pliny, lib. vi. 5. Dioscurias was on the A'nthemus, one of the rivers that came out of Caucasus into the Euxine.

CRUSADES. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Crusades opened to the eyes of the Europeans the sources of this Oriental wealth. The loss of the kingdom of Jerusalem enabled them to discover, that the power of Saladin was founded on the revenue derived from the commerce which passed through Egypt; aud the work of Marin Sanuto249 is a Memorial pre sented to the Pope, and the principal sovereigns of Europe, in order to instruct them, that if they would compel their mer chants to trade only through the dominions of the chaliphs of Bagdat, they would be better supplied, and at a cheaper rate ;. and would have no longer to fear the power of the soldans in Egypt. What those sovereigns did not, or could not do, was effected three centuries later by the discovery of the Cape of Good 245 This curious work is inserted in the Gesta Dei per Francos : it is highly interest ing, both upon account of the commercial in telligence it contains, and the clear-sighted speculations of the author. I owe the know ledge of it to Bergeron, who has cited it in his Treatise on Commerce annexed to his collec tion of Voyages, which is itself also a most valuable work. The editor of the Gesta Dei, &c. says, he had the Memorial of Sanuto, in two MSS, copies, from Scaliger and Peta vius; that one of these was bound in velvet, and ornamented with clasps, &c. so as to assure him that it was one of the original copies, presented by Sanuto himself to some one of the princes : if so, I imagine it contains the oldest map of the world at this day ex isting, except the Peutingerian Tables ; for Marin Sanuto lived in 1324. His map, how ever, is wholly in the Arabic form ; and, I conclude, built on one that he had procured when in Palestine. There is another Livjo Smuto, a geographer in the 16th century, whose work I have seen in the King's Library, but not examined ; it seemed a valuable work for the age.

Of the interior of Arabia we know little to this day ; but that, notwithstanding the danger of robbery, caravans of great value traversed it in all ages, is authenticated by sufficient evidence. Previous to the Periplus, we have the testimony of Strabo and Agatharchides; in the middle ages, the account of Al Edrissi ; and, in our own time, we want no other proof than the English importations at Jiddah, which reach Mecca at the time of the Pilgrimage, and from thence seem to be dispersed over the whole peninsula. At Grane likewise, in the north-west angle of the Persian GuTpti, there has been a considerable importation till within these few years ; and at El Catif, near Bahrain, which is the Gerrha of the ancients, there is some commerce besides the returns for the Pearl Fishery ; but with the progress of which, inland, we are unacquainted. Somewhere in the neighbourhood of Grane was the seat of Abdul Wahab, who, with his army of deists and democrats, has plundered Mecca within these three years, upon the same principle as his brethren in Europe demolished the Church of their own country, and with much the same event to the plun derers ; for Abdul Wahab is said to have fallen by the hands of an assassin, as the first democrats of France have mostly perished in the course of the revolution. His followers still"], [405, "ARABIA. 361 exist as a sect, and are spreading their ravages with as much rapidity as the first Mahomedans : they have plundered Mecca again, Kerbela and Meschid Ali, but do not yet seem to have assumed a regular establishment in any of the regions they have laid waste. XXVI. GERRHA. Gerrha is one of the few towns in Arabia that Pliny has enabled us to six with certainty ; for he comes down the western coast of the gulph, which, he says, was never explored till visited by Epiphanes ; and which remains to this hour in a state of obscurity : but Pliny, after passing the island of Ichara, and one or two obscure places, mentions Gerrha as a city five miles round, with its walls or towers built of fossil 2S\" salt. This is a circumstance true (I think) only at Ormus and El Katif, which, added to the size of the city, ascertains its identity. It is necessary to be particular in this respect, be cause the Gerrheans are the first conductors of the caravans upon record ; and it is highly probable, that long previous to history they enjoyed the profits of this traffic; for Agathar chides251, who first mentions them, compares their riches with those of the Sabeans ; and adds, that they brought much wealth into Syria, which was at that time subject to Ptolemy; and furnished a variety of articles for the industry of the Ph\u0153nicians. as\u00b0 Strabo also, lib. xvi. p. 766.

By this we understand, that they crossed the whole peninsula to Petra in Idumea, from which city we know that the inter course was open with Tyre, Phenicia, and Syria. Strabo2'52 in forms us, that they were the general carriers of all the produce of Arabia, and all the spices, or aromatics ; but he adds like wise, that Aristobulus contradicts this, and says, that they go up the Euphrates in boats, to Babylonia and Thapsacus, and from thence disperse their commodities in all directions by land. Both these relations may be true, as applied to different periods, in consequence pf the obstructions they might meet with in their course, from the different powers of the several countries through which they were to pass 25'. The Gerrheans, we may naturally suppose, from their situa tion in the Gulph of Persia, and from their proximity to the opposite coast of Persis and Karmania, would lie more con venient, and more directly in the route of communication with the East, than any other tribe. And, as Agatharchides says, that the Mineans and Gerrheans both met at Petra as a com mon centre, we have two routes across the peninsula, cor respondent to the two sorts of commerce, which ought naturally to pass in different directions : for from Gerrha, the produce of India, and, through the country of the Mineans the frankincense of Hadramaut, would regularly be directed to Idumea. ,sa ITsfsjxsWijt/i 3' ha-h oj TtffaTc, to vXia-i riiv 'A^aCiuy <fo^i-iis.-y xa) tIk Afajj/\u00c6Tucw.

MINEANS. The site154 of the Mineans is not easy to fix ; but by a com parison of different accounts, they were south of Hedjaz, north2\" of Hadramaut, and to the eastward 255 of Sabea; and they were the carriers to all these provinces: their caravans passed in seventy days from Hadramaut to Aila, as we learn from Strabo257; and Aila is but ten miles from Petra. The commodities brought by this caravan would be aloes, gold, myrrh, frankincense, and other precious gums or aromatics; while those from Gerrha would consist of cottons, spices, and the produce of the East. As navigation increased on the coast, this mode of inter course, and its profits, would naturally diminish. When the Ptolemies sent their fleets to Sabea ; when the Greeks, Egyp tians, or Romans, reached India by the monsoon, the greatest part of what had passed through Arabia would be diverted into a new channel ; in the same manner as the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope ruined the commerce of Alexandria.

Into this road fell the route from Basra, and from El Katif or Gerrha. The province of which El Katif is the capital, is called Bahrain259 by Al Edrissi, from the two islands of that name which are the prin cipal seat of the Pearl *\u00b0 Fishery. He speaks of El Katif as a considerable city in his time ; and he gives the routes from it south to Sohar, north to Basra, and west to Medina261; the country on the side towards Basra is a desert seldom frequented by merchants, without villages, and inhabited only by Be douins. But the route to Medina falls into the road that leads from Basra ; and both Basra and El Katif are at equal dis tance, that is, twenty stations from that city, where is the sepulchre of Mahomet.

XXVIII. ANTIQUITV OF ORIENTAL COMMERCE. So far as a private opinion is of weight, I am fully persuaded that this line of communication with the East, is the oldest in the world ; older than Moses or Abraham. I believe that the Idumeans, who were carrying spices into Egypt when they found Joseph in their way, obtained these spices b}' this very route. And if it is agreeable to analogy and to history that merchants travelled before they sailed, there is no course from India to the Mediterranean where so small a space of sea must be traversed as in this direction. Karmania is visible from Arabia at the straits of the Gulph of Persia ; and in the infancy of navigation, the shortest passage would be preferred. The interior of Arabia, in all ages, contained Bedouins, whose pro fession was robbery ; but the different tribes of robbers probably received a caphar instead of seizing the whole ; as they do to this day from the caravans which pass between Basra and Aleppo. They are likewise not fond of fighting for the whole, when they can obtain a tribute for a part ; and necessity would compel the merchants of those ages, as well as our own, to go in large \u00bb6J Petra was only ten miles from Aila.

The man ners of the Arabs have never changed ; and it is reasonable to conclude, that merchants who have to treat with Arabs have changed as little in their precautions. Pliny 2S4 has preserved the memorial of these usages in the southern part of the penin sula; and there is every reason to conclude that they existed in all ages, before his time, as they do to the present hour. It was to obviate these exactions that plans were formed to open a communication by sea. The Tyrians, as the principal merchants on the Mediterranean, and as the intermediate agents of Oriental commerce, either first conceived the idea, or de rived it possibly from the Egyptians, whom we must suppose to have had an intercourse with India whether history records it or not. The first historical account we have, is the trade of Ophir. The alliance between Hiram and Solomon was indis pensable ; for Solomon was master of Idumea, and the Tyrians could establish themselves at Ezion Geber only by his permis sion and assistance. Solomon furnished the opportunity, and Hiram the ships ; the prosit accrued to the partnership ; and if this voyage were made to Ophir in Arabia, where it is uni versally confessed there was an Ophir, even by those who search for Ophir in Africa and India ; such a voyage would at least obviate all the exactions attendant upon a communication by 254 Ibi decimas Deo, .... regi vectigal, . . .

This rapid sketch of Oriental Commerce in all ages, as far as it can be traced upon historical evidence, is no digression, but an essential part of the work I have undertaken : my object has been, not merely to elucidate the Periplus by a com mentary, but to trace the progress of discovery to its source ; a subject curious and interesting at least, if neither useful or lucrative. But to know w'hat has passed in remote ages is the purpose of all history ; and to collect, from a variety of sources, such intelligence as may enable us to distinguish truth from falsehood, if it has not the dignity of history, has at least a ckum to approbation from those who know how to appreciate the labour of research, and the fidelity of investigation. Much that has been said may be controverted in particulars, and yet be correct upon the whole. I am not conscious of any pre-\u201e conceived system in my own mind, but have raised a super structure upon the foundation of historical facts : these I have not warped, in order to accommodate them to an individual opinion, but have followed them wherever they led. I claim little merit but in concentrating these to a point ; and if the same evidence should not produce the same conviction on. others, I should as readily give way to those who are possessed of superior information, as I should maintain my ground against those who are pretenders to the science-"], [412, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 368 XXIX. CONCLUSION. It is now necessary to bring this Book to a conclusion, in which the course of ancient navigation has been traced from the Gulph of Aila to the mouth of the Euphrates 26s, embracing the whole sea-coast of Arabia on its three sides. The author does not appear, from the internal evidence of his work, to have personally explored the eastern coast of the Red Sea, or the western shore of the Gulph of Persia: he seems to have come down the Red Sea from Muos Hormus to Okelis ; or perhaps from Leuke Kome, but to have touched little upon the coast till he came to the Burnt Island. On the southern coast of the peninsula we can trace him, at almost every step, to Fartaque, and to Ras-el-had ; but from thence he seems, with out entering the Gulph of Persia, to have stretched over with the monsoon, either to Karmania, or direct to Scindi, or to the Gulph of Cambay. At those points we find him again entering into those minute particulars, which bespeak the descriptions of an eye-witness ; while, of the parts previous to these, he speaks in so transient a manner, as to create a belief that he writes from the report of others : but on this question it is not necessary to decide, the reader must determine for himself. On the two coasts of Arabia which he has touched but slightly, I have endeavoured to fill up the outline which he has sketched ; and on the third side, where he has entered into detail, I have endeavoured to follow him, step by step, as minutely as I have been able. But if the interior of Arabia is a desideratum in \"s Properly the Tigris."], [413, "ARABIA. 369 Geography, the coast likewise is far from being accurately de fined : no ships from Europe now visit it for the purpose of irade'; and those which come from India to Mokha or Jidda, seldom touch vipon the coast towards the ocean, unless to ob tain provisions when in distress. Such information as has been obtained from the English cruizers which have lately been in the Red Sea, and were at one time preparing to fortify Perim in the Straits, is inserted from Captain Bissell's Journal; and greater use would have. been made of that intelligent officer's account, had it come to hand before the several sheets were in the press. As it is, only a few particulars could be intro duced as opportunity offered, but they essentially contribute to the elucidation of the Peri pi (is. I have likewise made use of such lights as are afforded by the papers and jour nals of the officers of the East India Company, and which are collected in the work called the Oriental Navigator. Those who know the abilities and science of those excel lent officers, will think their observations might have been sufficient for such an examination as I had instituted ; but an cient navigators kept much nearer the coast, and noticed ob jects which are of small importance in the present state of the science. A minute particular often forms a characteristic of a port, a bay, or a shore, which we cannot hope to find in the common observations of modern officers, nor elsewhere, unless when an actual survey has taken place. In the voyage of Nearchus, as my own knowledge increased, I constantly found a greater correspondence in his Journal with the actual state of the coast : I have not been quite so fortunate in the present instance ; nor do I think the author of the Periplus to be com pared with the Macedonian commander, but still he is, as vol. it. 3 B"], [414, "37o PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA.

Luxury this was called by the philosophers and patriots both of Greece and Rome. But if every thing that is foreign 3b 2"], [418, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 372 is luxurious, there could be no commerce in the world ; and if every thing which is not strictly necessary for the support of life be superfluous, thirst might be satisfied without wine, and food digested without the addition of a relish. In this view, the most ordinary accompaniments of the table should be dis carded ; and salt and pepper should be enumerated among tho gratifications * of a sensual appetite. But if both are stimulants, still they are no less salutary than grateful ; and no reason can be given why salt should be considered as sacred at the table of the Greeks and Romans, while pepper was condemned as the indulgence of a voluptuary ; unless that the one was a do mestic produce, and the other an exotic. But barbarians were not to be enriched at the expence of Europe, and the Roman world was not to be impoverished for the attainment of Oriental luxuries; \u2014 certainly not, if the sword could retain as easily as it acquires ; but the wealth acquired by rapine must of necessity revert again into the channels of commerce ; and commerce, whether it tends to the East or to the West, will impoverish every nation which has no native industry to replace its de mands. Rationally speaking, all commerce consists in the ex change of superfluities; and luxuries are as easily introduced by dealing with nations nearer home, as with those at a dis tance. There is as little reason for declaiming against the Alexandrians who purchased pepper in India with the gold of Egypt, as against the Athenians, who exchanged the silver of Laureum for the salt of Sicily or Crete. 1 Of pepper Pliny says, Usum ejiis adeo ditate esurie non suit satis ... et tamen pon. placuisse mirum est sola placere amari- dere emitur ut aurum vel argentum.

And yet this, and all the other luxuries, we im port, do not impoverish us ; because we export on the one hand as we receive on the other; and, so far as we are the principal carriers between the Eastern and the Western world, we stand in the same situation as those ancient nations held, which were the medium between India and the Roman em pire, but with an hundred times more trade, more industry and capital.

The wildest tribes of America, admit traders into their country, and allow them to pass through it with security; the Scythians4 likewise, according to the earliest testimony of historv-, suffered the merchants of the Euxine to penetrate farther on the east and north, than we can trace their progress by the light of modern information. In civilized countries, this appetite increases in proportion to our knowledge, and the opportunity of procuring the variety which we covet. The indulgences of the palate are among the first stimulants of this emotion ; and second to these is ali that can delight the eye, or the mind, by novelty, beauty, variety, intrinsic or imaginary value. Excess of indulgence, avidity of possessing, profusion in acquiring, and wantonness in using, this variety of foreign articles, are both vicious and luxurious; but where to six the limit between the use and the abuse, is- a question more difficult to determine than we are aware of. Pliny condemns, above measure, the vanity of purchasing pearls and precious stones for the ornament of the Roman women ; while he extols the works of art in sculpture, painting, and en graving, with all the enthusiasm of an admirer. But if every thing is luxurious that is not necessary to our existence, the ornamenting of a house is certainly not more useful or more rational than the decoration of a woman.

The activity produced by the interchange of superfluities, is the glory of commerce, and the happiness of man ; but if its merits were to be fixed by the standard of utility alone, very narrow would be the limits within which the defence of it, by its warmest advocates, must be confined. Use we can discover none in the burning of tin foil before an idol in China; and yet this practice of a nation at one extremity of the world gives bread to thousands at the other, supports the mariner during a voyage of eleven thousand miles, and procures for Britain, by means of a native metal, what she must otherwise have pur chased by an imported one. Moral and philosophical reasoning, however, upon this ques tion, has had little weight in determining the general practice and habits of mankind. The prevailing taste implanted in our nature has made the pepper of Malabar, and the cinnamon of Ceylon, articles of request, from the earliest ages to the present hour ; the finer spices of the Moluccas grew equally into favour, in proportion as they became known : and the more modern demand for the tea of China, and the sugar of the East or West Indies, will never cease, but with the impossibility of procuring either of those articles, by the destruction of all in tercourse between the several nations of the world. 5 The poet understood this better than the philosopher, when he said, Nullus argento eolor est, nisi tempcrato splendeat usu."], [422, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 376 It has been shewn in the preceding pages, how the precious commodities of the East were procured, from the earliest periods that history can reach; and no revolutions of empire, either in the ancient or modern world, have ever been able to stop all the means of communication at once: the channels obstructed in one direction, have been opened in another. Tyranny, avarice, and extortion, have defeated their own ends; the monopoly of one country, as it grew intolerable, was transferred to others that were less oppressive ; fluctuating gene rally between the Red Sea, and the Gulph of Persia ; and driven sometimes to the North, by the exactions common to both. Such was the fate also of the last monopoly between Egypt and Venice, which, by its enormity, drove the Portu guese to the discovery of the communication by sea; and this channel once opened, can never be closed ; the whole world are partakers in the benefit ; and Britain has the pre-eminence, only because she has the greatest industry, the largest capital, and the superiority of naval power. It is a political consideration, awful to contemplate, and difficult to discuss, but still necessary to keep constantly in view, when we reflect how deeply all the interests of our country are concerned in the continuance of the pre-eminence we at present enjoy. Our possessions in India are almost be come a part of our existence as a nation : to abandon them is impossible ; to maintain them \u2014 a perpetual struggle with the native powers, and the powers of Europe to support them. Jt requires all the vigilance of government, and all the vigour of the controuling power, to take care that the natives should not be discontented under our empire ; and that the nations of 3"], [423, "INDIA 377 Europe should not be outraged by our approach to monopoly. These considerations, however, are totally distinct from the commerce itself, and totally foreign to the object of the present work : I touch them only as they arise, and return with pleasure to the humbler office of a commentator on the Peri plils. II. COURSE EROM OMAN IN ARABIA, UP THE GULPH OF PERSIA, OR, TO KARMANIA. We have now our choice of two courses; one up the Gulph of Persia to Bahrein and Oboleh, and the other across the open sea from Arabia to Karmania ; where we arrive, after a passage of six days, at the port of O'mana. This port manifestly takes its name from the province of Oman in Arabia, and was doubt less a colony of Arabs, established on the coast opposite to their own, for the purpose of approaching nearer to Scindi and India, or as an intermediate port on their vo}rage outward, and homeward bound. Whether the merchant, whose journal we are examining, ever went up the Gulph, or touched at the port of O'mana, is highly problematical. If he was there, he has left us but slender particulars of the place ; but there are some circumstances which induce a persuasion, that he passed from Arabia, either to the Indus or Barugaza, at a single stretch ; for, in the first place, he has fixed O'mana in Pcrsis, which must of necessity be either in Karmania or Gadrosia; and, added to this, his account of Oraia, in the latter province, is too obscure to prove any intimate knowledge cf the. country. VOL. ii. 3 c"], [424, "378 PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. III. OMANA IN GADROSIA. O'mana we recover a trace of in the Kombana6, or Nom mana, of Ptolemy, in the province of Gadrosia7, and in the bay he calls Paragon, to the eastward of Karpela8, or Cape Bombareek. I have proved, in the Voyage of Nearchus, and in the former part of this work, that the Arabs had visited this coast previous to all the navigation of the Greeks ; but this O'mana is not mentioned by Nearchus, and was therefore a colony established between his time and the date of the Peri plus. Its immediate representative cannot be now ascertained ; but its relative situation may be assigned from Ptolemy, be tween the River9 Iskim and Mucksa ; so that it must be in Gadrosia, and not many leagues east from Cape Jask.

Was this cinnamon obtained by the Arabians on the coast of Africa, where the Greeks found it ? or was it the Oriental cinnamon from Ceylon, procured at Barug&za, or any other port in India ? Cinnamon, from the first mention of it, ever came through Arabia into the Mediter ranean ; but Maketa '3 is the place farthest east at which I have found it mentioned ; and this is the only passage in any author which I have yet discovered, previous to the Scholiast of Dionysius, which would induce me to believe that the Arabians procured it from India. After leaving the district of O'mana, the country \"\u2022 which succeeds belongs to another government ; and there is a bay which is called the Bay of the Terabdi, formed by the coast trending inwards, in the middle of their. territory.

Doubtless this is an error arising out of the form of the coast upon ap proaching the Gulph of Persia; and if we suppose the ancient course of the passage from Arabia to Karmania to have been made across, without approaching the Straits, the apprehension of such a bay is natural. This is the passage indicated by the Periplus, six days in extent ; and may perhaps have misled the author, as well as others, who followed the same course. In or near this bay, we are informed that there is a river which admits vessels, and a small port at the mouth of it called Oraia. The capital of the district is inland, at the distance of seven 'days journey, where the king resides. The country pro duces plenty of corn, wine, rice, and dates ; but on the coast nothing except bdellium ,s. These circumstances happen to coincide with an account given to Lieut. Porter, when he was at Chewrabad l6, on this coast ; for a coast without produce he experienced, and the natives told him of a city seven days inland, large and walled : if therefore we knew where to fix the limits of our author's bay of the Terabdi, we should have something to direct us to a position. The river seems like the Tanka Banca, or White River, of the charts ; while Oraia bears a resemblance to the Orit\u0153 of Near chus ; but to these it is hardly related, as the journal certainly intimates a great extent of the coast between Oraia and the Indus ; while the Orit\u00e6 of Nearchus are within fifty leagues of that river.

On the whole of this indeed, as we have so few data to guide us, it is safer to suspend our judgment than to decide. On the coast which follows, and which may be supposed to be the tract between Guadel and the Indus, the descrip tion accords much better with the reality I7 ; for we are told, that18 there is a vast sweep of the shore round the indenture of the bays, which have an inclination to the East; and, after passing these, a low tract of country towards the sea, called Scythia, lies on the north of the course, and which extends to the river Sinthus. These bays are evidently meant for those that are formed by the Capes Possem, Arraba, and Monze ; and the bay im mediately preceding Monze has a large sweep, to which, with the assistance of imagination, we may give a direction to the East, as its inmost curve is somewhat to the east of Cape Monze. It is added, that during the course from Monze to the Indus, the land is low, and lies to the north of the vessel that is passing to the East. This tract is now called Scindi; and the Scythia of the Periplfts, wherever it occurs, is the actual Scindi 19 of the Oriental and modern geographers.

I am myself persuaded that this distinction is original ; and that it is the cause of the error which has been adopted by Ptolemy, and other ancient geographers : but if this opinion is rejected, I should then say, that Scythia is a corruption of Scynthia, and that Scynthia is as precisely Scindi, as Sinthus is the Indus.

The celebrated embassies likewise of the Syrian monarchs to Sandrocottus and Alitrochades, the sovereigns of Hindostan, probably embraced objects of commerce as well as empire; for those who found their way to the Ganges, could not be unacquainted with the profits to be derived from the commerce of the Indus. The first10 ship that coasted round the peninsula of Arabia from the Red Sea, or that retraced the steps of Nearchus back again from the Gulph of Persia, would naturally direct its course to Patala and the Indus. Here it was known from his tory that the productions of the East were to be obtained; and here the trade, which passed in the earliest ages between all the countries at the sources of the Indus and the coast of Mala bar, must always have fixed its centre. As the Greeks and Romans increased their knowledge, and finally became ac quainted with the monsoon, they made their passage to India direct; but the voyage to the Indus was not yet abandoned in the age of the Periplus, nor probably for several ages later.

Al Biruni27 was long resident in this country, and consequently his authority is great; and it is to be presumed that De la Rochette follows him as a guide, in placing Minha vareh on the Indus, between the Island of the Behker and the Delta: Al Edrissi places his Manhabere at two stations, or sixt}' miles, from Dabil ; and Dabil, he adds, is three stations, or ninety miles, from the mouth of the Indus; that is, it is at the head of the Delta, and Manhabere sixty miles higher.

But if Al Biruni and Al Edrissi can be reconciled, a Minhavareh, sixty miles above the Delta, agrees perfectly with the Minnagara of the PeriplAs, and sufficiently with the Binnagara of Ptolemy ; but not with ?iis Minnagara, for that is in Guzerat, and he has another in the Bay of Bengal. D'Anville18 supposes Minn&gara to be the same as Mansoura, and Dabil to be at the mouth of the Indus, instead of being at the head of the Delta, where Al Edrissi places it ; but we approach so near a conclusion by means of the two Oriental geographers, that I think the position is cor rect. The journal says, that the ships lay at Barbarikc, which was a port on the middle branch of the Indus, near the sea, and facing a small island ; that Minnagar was beyond it inland ; and that the whole cargo was carried up to that metropolis by the river. The representative to supply the place of such a capital would be the modern Loheri, at the southern termina tion of the Isle of Behker, which, a century ago, was a place of considerable commerce, and gave name to the two principal branches of the Indus, east and west, as they divide to embrace the Delta : the eastern is styled Bundar-Loheri, and the western, Loheri-Bundar29. One circumstance most remarkable is, that the port of Bar barike is placed on the middle channel of the seven ; and the other six are said to be too. shallow, or too marshy, to be navi gable.

Whether the government of Minnagar cleared and opened the centre one, can only be conjectured ; ships did not go up it, and what water was required for the boats that carried up their lading, depends on the nature of the vessels which were employed. The Ritchel River, and that which issues at Scindi Bar, may either of them have been navigable in former times, or in different ages, according to the interest or situation of the different governments which may have pre vailed. Rennell * still speaks of the Ritchel River as the largest ; and without calculating whether it is precisely the central issue of the seven, here Barbarike might be placed, if other circumstances should be found to correspond. It is some proof of the fact, that Ptolemy has placed his Barbari in the Delta, convenient for the third and fourth channel ; but his Barbari does not answer to the Barbarikk of the Peripl&s ; it is above his Patala, while the Barbarikk of the PeriplAs is at the mouth of the channel, and close to the sea. It ought likewise to be observed, that this term is not the native name of a port, but a Greek epithet32, implying, the Barbaric Port, the Bar baric Country, derived, if the conjecture may be allowed, 30 The western channel, which conducted to Lori-Bundar and Tatta, was the only one frequented by the English.

Now Rha is the native name of the Wolga ; and Rha Ponticum would be the drug that came by the Rha, and Pontus, into Greece. But another conveyance of this drug would be out of Tartary to Cabul, and from Cabul down the Indus to Scindi, and to this port of Barhari, or Barbarike. If then the name of the drug Rha was already received in Europe, would not the Rha procured in Scindi be called the Rha Barbarum ? \u2014 I have not found this drug in Pliny, but suspect it to be his Rhacoma, xxvii. 105. very dubiously describ ed ; and I know thar Rha Ponticum, and Rha Barbarum, convey now ideas not consonant to this explication ; but still it may be the true one, originally. (See Isbrandt Isles, Ner ginskoi.) The ground for the adoption of this opinion is derived from Salmasius. Bayer observes, that Rha signifies a river in the lan guage of the natives. Hist. Bact. p. 163. from Scaliger, Doct. Temporum.

Am. Mar. p. 390 : and, because this root was brought out of the Euxine, he confounds the Rha with the Don, and supposes it near the Palus M\u0153otis.

Upon approaching the mouths of the Indus, the sea is white ; and the sign of land before it is seen, is a multitude of snakes, called Graai,. floating on the surface. This circumstance, which seemed fabulous to the ancients, and some of the moderns, is now known to be a fact that takes place down the whole coast of Malabar, as well as on the ap proach to the Indus ; it is imputed to the rains of the monsoon washing down these animals3\" out of the rivers.

For this reason pilots are appointed by government, with attendants in large boats, called Trappaga and Kotumba; thbse vessels ad vance as far as Surastreue, or Kutsch, and wait there to pilot \" Kammoni is sufficiently marked here on the side of the Gulph of Cambay, opposite to Diu, to shew that it cannot be far from the position of Surat, or at least must be south of Barugaza ; and so Ptolemy places Kamanes in his most distorted map of this coast ; and yet Major Rennell says, Cambay appears to be the Camaries of Ptolemy.

Their first service, at the entrance of the gulph, is to bring round the ship's head, and keep her clear of the shoals : this they do by means of the many hands they have on board, and by taking the vessel in tow from sta tion 6\u00b0 to station, which stations are all known and marked ; they move with the beginning of the tide, and anchor as soon as it is spent at certain berths that are called Basons*'; and these basons still retain water after the tide is out, all the way to Barug&za. The town itself lies thirty miles up the river; a cir cumstance which directs us to Baroache, Avithout a possibility of mistake. The difficulty of navigating this bay affords a sufficient reason why Barug&za should be more flourishing than Cambay, and Surat preferable to Barug&za or Baroache ; and yet Cambay was a great place of trade when Tavernier was in India. Mr. Hamilton adds, that the people of Cambay were formerly heterodox, or Bhuddists ; and that Ariake, which corresponds with Kemkem, or Concan, is the Country of Believers, pro bably in contrast to the inhabitants of Cambay. How wonder fully does this accord with the rise and success of Sevagee, and the Mahrattas, the restorers of Braminism in India, and the conquerors of the Mahomedau powers? The native supersti tion would naturally survive in the mountainous regions of the peninsula, while the Mahomedans overran the plains of Iliu- *5c Cesar Frederick mentions the bore here, \" whence yon came ; for there is no staying and on the coast of Pegu ; he calls it the Ma- \u00ab at any place but at these jlagions.\" Hack. careo, and his expression is peculiar : \" In luyt, ii. 234. \" these tides must be lost no jot of time, for 6' KySfm, literally, kettles; from w/Sjet, \" if you arrive not at the stations before the obsolete; xvrt}ml> Hesych.

The Mah ratta chiefs are many of them Bramins ; but when in power, we find nothing oLthat meek spirit of the Hindoos so much vaunted in Europe: they have dethroned their sovereigns; they are the most cruel ravagers and invaders ; equally greedy of desolation as plunder ; they have destroyed much, and nothing: in short, they have made it a question, whether the whole people were not happier under the government of the Ma homcdans, than their own. The house of Timour was a mild dynasty ; and although Aurengzebe was a tyrant, a persecutor, and a hypocrite ; Acbar was the father of his country. But to return : The circumstance of the tides is not peculiar to this place, though they are more violent here than elsewhere ; for almost all the rivers of India are large, and have both the flux and re flux of extraordinary strength, conforming with the moon, new and full, as well as for three days after each, and falling off a^ain in the intermediate space ; but at Barug&za. this violence is more remarkable, so that without warning you see the bottom laid bare, and the sides next the coast, where vessels were sail ing but just before, left dry as it were in an iststant; again, upon the access of the flood-tide, the whole body of the sea is driven in with such violence, that the stream is impelled up wards for a great number of miles, with a force that is irresistible. This makes the navigation very unsafe for those that are unac quainted with the gulph, or enter it for the first time. N\u00ae anchors are a security ; for when the vehemence of the tide"], [447, "INDIA 399 commences, there is no intermission, no retreat : large vessels caught in it are hurried away by the impetuosity61 of the cur- rent, and thrown on their sides, or wrecked upon the shoals ; while the smaller ones are completely overset63. Many also that have taken refuge in the creeks, unless they have for- tunately changed *\" their place in due time, (which it is very difficult to do, on account of the instantaneous fall of the wa- ter,) upon the return of the tide are filled with the very first head of the flood, and sunk. But all these circumstances united concur more especially, if the new65 moon falls in con junction with the night tide; for then, if you have been pre- pared to enter upon the first of the flood, and when the sea appeared perfectly calm, you shall hear, in a moment, a rushing sound like the tumult of battle, and the water driving forward with the utmost impetuosity, covers the whole of the~bare shoals in an instant. It will immediately appear, that this description relates to that sort of tide which is called the Bore6', and is, common to many places in Europe as well as India. On the coast of Egypt, or in the Red Sea, the author could have seen nothing that resembled it, and he dwells upon it, therefore, with more 64 \"Ot o;v fj-ii! StEfiVj.

We come next to the enumeration of the countries with which Barugaza is connected, and its relative situation with regard to the provinces that surround it. Among these, on the north-west, lie the Aratrii, Rachoosi67, and Tanth&ragi, names with which we are totally unacquainted, as they do not occur in any other author; but that they lie towards the north-west, between Guzerat and Multan, is manifest from the succeeding district of Proklais, which comprizes the city of Bookephalos, for that we know to be in the Panjeab. He then adds, that \u25a0beyond Proklais, still farther to the north-west, lies the pro vince of Bactria, governed by its own68 kings. Here we may observe, that the country between Guzerat and the Indus is to this day less known than any other part of India : it is a sandy desert, affording refuge to tribes of Raj pouts, Hendouans, and Ashambetis, called Jams, who are all without fixed habitations, and plunderers like the Arabs. These may correspond 69 with the hordes mentioned by the author; but from Minnagar up wards, to the Panjeab and to Bactria, we can follow him with 67 The Rachoosi are the giants of India, as I learn from Mr. A.

The last particular seems evidently to refer to the wells which Alexander opened in his three days march to the East from the eastern branch of the Indus : they were on the route to Guzerat ; and the route between the Indus and that province is kept open, at this day, only by wells of this description in the desert. But we are told afterwards, that Alexander marched eastward from these countries to the Ganges 7t, neglecting Limurike, and the whole peninsula on the south. This only proves that our author was a much better merchant than an historian ; but he redeems his error by the preservation of a circumstance which fell under his own observation; which is, that coins with the Greek inscriptions of Menander and Apollodotus, who reigned in this country after Alexander, were still current in Ba- rug&za.

And it is a truth (as I learn from Clark on Coins), that the Byzantine standard was not only the purest, but most permanent, of any in the world. Before we can proceed to the commerce of Barug&za, we have other relative situations to consider, as Ozene on the East, and Plithana, and T&gara, on the south-east. These Lieut.

There is every reason to adopt his conclusions; and if, after the several circumstances already enumerated, we have cause to think highly of the information of our author, we shall be disposed, after tracing these several connections, to allow that there is no specimen of ancient geography so completely satis fuctorv, or so consonant to truth, as the portion now under contemplation.

And what do we see in this, but the prototype of the Mahomedan usurpations, which have been too faithfully copied by European powers ? and whose plaoe the British occupy as masters of Surat, Baroache, and Cambay, at the present hour. When the Europeans first reached India, Surat wTas the principal seat of commerce on the north, as Calicut was on the south ; and the merchants of Guzerat were the richest and most active traders in India. Surat is not more than forty or fifty miles from Baroache, and Baroache 77 is the Barug&za of the Periplus. In the age of that work, the merchants of this country were not less vigorous^ engaged in their pursuits; they traded to Arabia for gums aud incense, to the coast of Africa for gold, and probably to Malabar and Ceylon for pepper and cinnamon. If I could find any thing in history to countenance the idea of the Hindoos78 being seamen7* in any age, I should place them in this province.

Fishermen there are, but they can cook and eat their food on shore ; and even fishermen are an abomination in Malabar. Merchants, however, may grow rich at home, while other nations are their carriers8*; and that the greatest trade of India was in that age fixed in Guzerat, is evident, not only from the enumeration of articles at this port, but from the general importauce it bears in the mind of the author, and the circumstantial detail of all that is connected with it. The connection with Ougein \", and the mention that this place was once the seat of government, is in perfect conformity with modern information ; for Ougein84, as it is at present subject' to Scindia, and the capital of his jaghire, so was it, from the earliest awes, the properest situation for a metropolis, as being in the centre of those tribes of Hindoos which have been less85 Arabs chiefly.

Pliny makes no direct mention of Ozene, but incidentally only, as denoting a species of the spikenard ; but Ptolemy calls it the capital of Tiastanus, and his royal residence ; he places it on the Xam&dus, or Nerbudda, that is the river of88 Barugaza ; which river is said to rise out of the same lake as the Saone, which takes an eastern Dckan had never been reduced ; and though the Rana of Ougein, who was the principal of the Hindoos of Agimere, had been sub dued by Acbar, the interior was so difficult of access, that there had always remained tribes io the mountains who were independent.

Of this country [which is called Dakhan] that part which lies inland, east of Barug&za, comprizes a great space of wild and desert country, and large mountains, in which are found leopards, tigers, ele phants, vast serpents, hyenas, and baboons \" of various sorts. [But in the inhabited parts] there are also a great variety of different nations, and exceedingly populous, quite across the peninsula to the Ganges ,c*.

With equal propriety, the Tagara of Ptolemy and the Periplils, is connected with the Pirate Coast, both comprehended in the province of Ariake, and both subject to Baleokoorus', whose capital was at Hippokoora, supposed by D'Anville1\" to be the Balhara \"J of Al Edrissi114.

The names of places,, rivers, mountains, and provinces, in Ptolemy, are as astonishing as his errors in position, longitude, and latitude,. are manifest. His positions, however, are for the most part relatively right, though they are essentially wrong ; and the errors of his longitude, in which he is principally mistaken, must have arisen from his manner of acquiring information \u2014 by interrogating the merchants and mariners at Alexandria, whose reports were from memory, and not from journals. But it is evident, that many of these must have penetrated far in land, otherwise he could not have left us the great outline of truths which is still manifest in his works, and which makes us forgive all his particular errors, in consideration of the general and important information that we obtain. VIII. I am now to enter upon the description of this coast, incidentally traced by Hardouin, Robertson, Rennell, Paolino, and many others ; but where no one has regularly gone before me, through the whole extent, except d'Anville. His conclu sions I shall be compelled to question, but. it will not be done without diffidence on my part, and without due respect to his learning and abilities ; for d'Anville is the first writer, properly speaking, who has taught us to investigate the geography of the ancients, by tracing the characters of different coasts and countries as they exist at present : to him we look up, as to a master in this branch of the science ; and even where his errors are demonstrable, we cannot but respect the extent of his learning, experience, and penetration. At the commencement of our inquiry, the first information we receive from the Periplus is, that the extent of the coast"], [469, "r N D I A 421 from- Barug&za to Limsirike is seven thousand stadia, or seven hundred miles ; but as this would carry us, at one step, to Mount d'llli130; it is rejected by Rennell, d'Anville, and I be lieve all the writers who have examined the subject. The com naen cement of Limvirike, our author has placed at Na6ora, Tundis, and Mooziris. And as it will hereafter appear that these places must be near the northern limit of Canara, and that therefore we have every reason to conclude Limurike has nearly the same limit as that province, we cannot take off less than two hundred from the seven hundred miles, to preserve the proportion of the coast. This is one reason, among others, which may induce a doubt, whether or not the writer of the Peri pi (Is performed this part of the voyage himself. The first places mentioned, upon leaving Barug&za, are Akab/iroos1'1, Oopara,- and Kalliena. '3\" In consideration of this circumstance, and my general dependance on the measures of the Periplus, I was originally disposed to consider Ariake as comprehending the whole coast, from the Tapti to Mount d'llli ; and if the Province of Limurike were to commence at that cape, the islands off the coast of Li murike, that produce the tortoise-shell, accord ing to the Periplus, and which may be well assumed for the Lack Dives, correspond better with a Limurike south of d'llli, than north. But the strong ground that Rennell has taken for assigning Nelkunda to Neli-ceram ; the circumstances at that place according so essen tially with the ancient account ; the division between Limurike and the Kingdom of Pan dion, that is, Canara and Malabar ; added to the correspondence of the islands on the coast, made me prefer the arrangement which I have adopted. The detail of this will be explained at large as we proceed. 131 It is not affectation, or a love of singH larity, that induces me to assume the Greek kappa, rather than the c of the Latins, or the English diphthong oo, for the Greek ov ; but a hope that the true sound, and true ortho graphy, may direct the eye or the ear of mo dern travellers, or voyagers, to the discovery of ancient names. The distortion of European names by Oriental writers is astonishing to us; and our mode of expressing Oriental sounds, received by the ear, must be equally offensive to their perceptions. Ebn Haukal writes Sa kaliah, Akrites, and Kibres, p. 53. which would certainly require some attention of the mind before a common reader would discover that they are Sicilia, Creta, and Cyprus."], [470, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 422 In regard to Kalliena, all suffrages131 are united to fix it ih the neighbourhood of Bombay ; for Bombay is upon an island, close to which, on the main, was an ancient city called Gallian. The ruins of Gallian still remain, and are noticed by Fryer'31 in 1675, as the most glorious ruins in the Dqkhan the Ma homedans ever had to deplore. His account proves it to have been a city of the Hindoos, and its situation commanding Basseen, Salset, and Bombay, gives it a pre-eminence as a mart of commerce in all ages. But if we have so much concurrent testimony for fixing Kalliena near Bombay, we have almost two hundred miles of coast on which we are to look for the other two places named ; and if Oopara be the Soopara of Ptolemy, as is generally allowed, it must be a placebos some note'35; for Subara is joined with the mention of Cambay, in the middle ages, by Al Edrissi. It is supposed, by d'Anville, to answer to the Sefareh el Hende13* of the Oriental geographers, in contradis- tinction to Sefareh el Zinge on the coast of Africa, which is the Sofala of the Portuguese; and these two Sofalas, one in India, and the other in Zanguebar, are supposed to be in constant habits of mutual commerce and correspondence, by means of the alternate monsoons. * Orme, Rennell, Robertson, d'Anville, Cosmas, Paolino 100.

On this latter point there can hardly be a doubt, when we find that the vessels employed in this trade sometimes discharged part of their lading in Zan- guebar, and proceeded afterwards to Arabia; and when we learn from the same work, that most of the settlers on that coast were Arabs, and several of the places subject to the dif- ferent sheiks of Arabia, as they are at this day. These are the large vessels from Ir.dia, which Agath&rchides describes as- early as the time of Philadelphus, found by the Greeks in the ports of Arabia ; and from which they obtained all the com- modities of the East before they went to India themselves. This commerce we may carry back to the ages long antecedent to history, and conclude, that as the monsoon must be known to the inhabitants of both coasts from the time they were in- habited, so must the communication have been opened from the earliest period in which mariners ventured to commit them selves to the ocean. It is almost superfluous to add, that the Sefareh both of Africa and India has been converted into the Ophir of Solomon, as it has suited the hypothesis of different authors, to carry his fleets to the east or to the louth ; and fortunately, both opinions may be maintained or combated, without danger of controvert ing the authority of scriptire.

Tana is likewise noticed by Friar Odorick, the first missionary upon record in India ; for the date of his visit is 1531. The work is not his own writing, but taken from his report, and among much that inclines to the mar vellous, contains some extraordinary truths. He came from Ormus to Tana, which he describes as a place of considerable commerce in that age. He gives a rational account of the pepper trade on the coast of Minibar [Malabar], and of the Christians of St. Thomas at Meliapoor, on that of Mobar, [the Mahabar of Marco Polo, or Coromandel]. But I have introduced him to the notice of the reader, on account of his sailing on board a vessel which carried seven hundred people. This is a confirmation of the account we have of those large ships, from the time of Agath&rchides down to the sixteenth century ; the ships of Guzerat which traversed the Indian Ocean in all ages ,4S.

This circumstance, Lieut. Wilford observes, savours strongly of an improper conduct in the traders, or might arise from the jealousjr of a native power. The Romans shewed their influence, by erecting a temple to Augustus at Muziris; and if we suppose an attempt of this kind made at Kaliiena, it bears a resemblance to the encroachment of Europeans on the natives, as well as the intrusions of the Arabs and Mahomedans. If we could have connected these governors, or rajahs, of the coast, with M&mbarus, the sovereign of Ariake, or fixed the residence of M&mbarus at T&gara, Plithana, or Hippocoora, our picture would be complete; but on these points the Peripl&s is silent.

How this enumeration can have misled those who have pre ceded me in the inquiry, I cannot say ; but to my apprehension we have the Pirate Coast, between Bombay and Goa, as mani festly delineated as we could require, and to that district our attention must be confined. On the primary point, indeed, of a coast infested by pirates, there is little difference of opinion ; Ptolemy and Pliny are both in harmony with the Periplrls, and modern writers are generally agreed ; for\" pirates there have been in all ages, as they are here described, till the Severn? droog of Angria was taken by the English in 1765. But when we have obtained the coast, why any one should travel out of it to find modern names correspondent to those of our author, is not easily reconciled to the canons of geography. All these names are given as what our seamen would call country ports, frequented143 only by the natives; and whether we can find representatives for them or not, is of no great importance, if we can mark the limits of the provinces ; to effect which, the mo dern divisions of the country may be of great assistance. Orme149 has observed, that the Mahratta language is spoken from Bardez, or Goa, to the Tapti ; and these very limits I would assign to the Ariake of the Periplus.

For the situation of the few correspondent places, which I shall propose for the consideration of the reader, if the proofs should not amount to conviction, I shall at least do no violence to my author, or his text : I leave every thing free for discus sion, as I find it; and even if my deductions should be er roneous, they will affect my own arrangement only, and mis lead no one who is disposed to prosecute farther inquiries on the subject.

To a common inquirer, the language of the Peripl&s is perfectly consistent ; and if a resemblance of names has misled men of superior information, it ought to set, others more espe cially on their guard to follow the arrangement of the work which they have undertaken to explain, and not to erect systems of their own, which can be supported only by a perversion of the text. The Pirate Coast was not formers, and is not now, so totally inhospitable as to exclude all intercourse: the Portu guese had settlements at Daman and Basseen, north of Bom bay, as well as at Choul and Dabul, to the south ; and it is a conjecture highly probable, that the Zizerus of Pliny, and the Meli-Zeigara ISi of the Periplus, were at ,s3 Siddee-Zyghur Is\\ about an hundred and forty miles south of Bombay.

The point where they left the coast of Arabia, was Suagros, or Fartaque; and the port they directed their course to, was Zizerus. This had been the usual track, but was not a safe one, because of the pirates which infested the coast, and which made it necessary for the ships not to sail without a body of archers on board ; for this reason they had been latterly obliged to change their port aud repair to Muziris, though it was a more inconvenient place to receive their lading, and still not safe from the attempts of the pirates in the neighbourhood. In the first instance, the pirates were on the coast ; in the second, in the neighbourhood. This exactly agrees with the Periplds, which places Meli-Zeigara in Ariake or Concan, and Muziris in Limurike or Canara; and when we come to Muziris, we shall find a farther correspondence that appears conclusive. 1 I wish to build no more on this conjecture than it will bear; but as I have found the utter impossibility of assigning posi- tions to the places named in the Periphls, and pretend to nothing more than prescribing limits to the province, even a conjecture of probability is worth something on a barren sub ject ; and to another, which must follow it, I attach no greater importance.

That good Carmelite informs us, that Balepatna ,s8 signifies a great city ; it is no great force, therefore, put upon this interpretation, to make it the great city, the capital, or the residence of a sove reign. And on this coast we have two Rajapoors, meaning, literally, she City of the Rajah. The most northerly of these, called Dunda Rajapoor, does not disagree with the Balepatna of* Ptolemy. The distortion of his maps, however, does not allow us to speak with precision on the subject; but if his Se mulla ,S9 be St. John's Point (which it is more like than any thing else), his Balepatna lies somewhat short of two degrees lower down than his Semulla, and Dunda Rajapoor lies nearly at the same distance from St. John's. If I gain nothing by advancing these conjectures, I at least do no prejudice to my author; for his Palai-patmai is subsequent to Kalliena, and his arrangement is not disordered by the present supposition. But where there is so little certainty attainable, it will be some pleasure to rest at last upon a. point that presents us a resemblance of truth.

But if, on the account of their number, we should be disposed to assume these for the Sesekreien\u00e6, there are not two islands between Goa and the Angedives to correspond with Aigidii and Kainitai. The fact is, that out of the whole twelve islands only Goa and Murmagon arc conspicuous; the others lie ob scured in the sound. This is a sufficient reason for assigning Aigidii :65,to Goa, and Kainitai to Murmagon16'; for Leuke, or the White Island, is separated from them by the text, and I have little hesitation in carrying it to Angedive. This disposition would account for all the islands upon this part of the coast, and place them in a relative situation perfectly consistent with the Journal. Kainitai cannot be questioned, if its vicinity to the Chersonese be con sidered ; but the assumption of Leuke for the Angedive I would leave to the determination of any Navigator acquainted with the coast, who could ascertain whether it has any appearance of whiteness I7\u00b0 to distinguish it from other Islands. vessels of any considerable size.

But the point off which the Ange-dive lies, would, I think, be called a Chersonese by no ancient author. 170 I have myself found no white island nearer than the Sacrifice Rock near Calicut, which is 270 miles from C.

The Angedives signify five islands ; and Ptolemy has a Iiep tan\u00a3sia, or group of seven islands, intended to represent this cluster, but so misplaced, as not to admit of any conclusion from it. \"One of these only is inhabited and fortified in by the Portuguese, who have a garrison here composed of malefactors exiled from Goa ; the others, whether more or less than the numbers which give it different names, are only islets or rocks. The passage between the principal island and the main is clear; and this affords it a prominence, which may have entitled it to the notice of the Periplus. In the So^ind of Goa, the principal island, with its de pendencies, had afforded a place of refuge for such Mahomedans as had been driven from the Hindoo ports or cities on the con tinent, before the arrival of the Portuguese. Here the Ma homedans of the peninsula collected, who intended to embark for Judda, and perform their pilgrimage to Mecca. This alone was sufficient to make it a port of importance ; and the more so, as we may conclude that the Hindoos had no influence and no share in the government; for the Mahomedans had esta blished themselves here, as the fugitives on the coast of the Hadriatick had done on the islands which now compose the city of Venice; and they seem, like them, to have formed a community, which was distinguished by the name of Tricurii, or the Thirty Villages.

D'Anville is disposed to place Goa a't Nelkunda; that is, at the \"southern, instead of the northern boundary of Limurike ; but he is not satisfied with his own supposition, and abandons it. He fixes, likewise, Aigidii at the Angedives; to which Paolino assents, without reflecting that there must be two islands together, connected with a group preceding and a single island following. These circumstances cannot accord with the system they have adopted ; but are perfectly consistent with the Periplus, and the disposition I have assumed. I have no pre dilection to this arrangement, because it is my own ; but I have tried the Journal by the best charts I have of the coast, and can find no points, either to the north or to the south, which will correspond ; and therefore conclude, that by this every. thing is done for obtaining the truth that the text wilL admit. But the division of the provinces remains still to be con sidered ; and the termination of Concan is fixed by our charts at Cape Ramas, about two-and-twenty miles south of Goa ; near which is Carwar, once an English factory in the territories of the Soonda'73 Rajah; and the jurisdiction of this prince is said by Capt.

At Meerzee, therefore, I assume the boundary between Ariake. and Limurike, guided by the Leuke of the Peri phis, as the last place mentioned in Ariake, and by Naoora, as the first place mentioned in Limurikk. This assumption, if correct, will re concile the positions on the whole coast, from Goa to Cape Comorin ; and if erroneous, confines the error within the dis tance between Murmagon and the Angedive : an error, at the utmost, of forty175 miles; moderate in comparison of the dis agreements between d'Anville and Paolino; and causing no disorder in the arrangement of the provinces, but such as majr be remedied by the most transient reference to the map.

The province of Barug&za, answering to Guzerat, under the power of Minnagar, commencing at the Indus and terminating at the Tapti, is the first. The second is Ariake, subject to M&mbarus ; a sovereign whom we might compare to Sevagee, or a Mahratta power of the present day; bordering north on Guzerat, and south on Canara ; of the same extent as the Pirate Coast, and distinguished at this day as fixing the same boundary to the Mahratta language, as to the province, ancient and modern. Limurike is the third, with its northern confine either at Cape Ramas or Meerzee, and its southern previous to Nelkunda ; cor responding with Canara, which commences at the same point m, and has its southern- limit at Decla. And lastly, the kingdom of Pandion as a fourth division, equivalent to Malabar Proper, succeeded by Paralia and Comari, and terminating with the Pearl Fishery and Ceylon.

After (his comprehensive view, the contention which may arise about the appropriation of individual names to particular ports, towns, or stations, is a matter of very inferior considera tion : my conjectures or assertions may be disputed as well as those of others, who have trod the same ground ; but till the great outline which I have traced can be obliterated, the service rendered to the science must be acknowledged. Many of the gentlemen now in India are possessed of minds illuminated by education, and stimulated with a desire of en larging the bounds of science, or assisting the inquiries of litera ture ; these, in their respective situations, must have acquired a local knowledge, which cannot be obtained by those who draw their information from written evidence alone. To such men as these I have made a constant appeal, and submit the deductions I have traced to their correction ; particular errors there may be, but by the general division of the provinces, I leave a guide to all that may be disposed to further these in quiries, and a rule for rectifying every thing in which I may have been mistaken. Still the investigation should be made, not by those, like Fra Paolino, who drew every thing to Mala bar, because he had resided thirteen years in the province, but by men of enlarged mind and general information, qualified, like Capt. Wilford, with classicai learning, and a knowledge of the native language ; enabled to direct their view to ages past as welt as present; and possessed of comprehensive faculties, which can embrace the general state of India, as well as the"], [489, "INDIA 441 particular province in which they happen- to have been em ployed.

How d'Anville could be persuaded that this province was the representative of Concan, is inexplicable ; for Pliny, whom he \u25a0chiefly follows, says expressly, that Muziris was not on the Pirate Coast, but in its neighbourhood only; and the Pirate Coast is as clearly defined by all our ancient authorities, as by the modern accounts. Cape Ramas, as a northern boundary, and Nelkunda, in the territory of Pandion, as a southern limit, identify Limurike so precisely with Canara, that we cannot be mistaken. These likewise are the limits of the lan o-ua^e I77 at the present day, which is a distinct dialect from that of Malabar on the south, or the Mahratta language on the north ; and this is a characteristic less fluctuating than any divi sion of the country that conquest might produce.

The king184 of Limurike, and the king of the country south of that province, that is Pandion, are said both to have their residence inland by our author ; and Pliny adds, that Pandion lived far inland, at the city of Mod{isa, which Ptolemy calls Modoora, the metro polis of Pandion. The conjecture, perhaps, will not be ad mitted; but it seems as if the power of Pandion had been su perseded in Malabar, between the age of the Peripliis and Ptolemy ; for Ptolemy reckons Aii next to Lim{irike on the south, and takes no notice of Pandion till he is past Cape Comorin, and comes actually to M&dura,. on the eastern side of the peninsula. Not that his east and west are on the two faces of the angle, for they are on a line; but he is relatively right, though essentially mistaken. In the limits of Limurike, Ptolemy is nearly in correspondence with our author; for he commences with Tundis, omitting: Naoora, and finishes with Becare, which is close to Nelkunda, and Nelkunda in both is the first port of Malabar.

He notices but three in this province \u2014 Naoora, Tundis, and Mooziris ; all distinctly marked as subject to Keprobotas, and in a different district from Nelkunda, which was in the kingdom of Pandion. It is remarkable, that not one of these three places is accom panied with any local circumstances sufficient to mark its distinction ; but Mooziris is five hundred stadia south of Tundis, and Nelkunda at the same distance south' from Mooziris. If therefore we could fix Nelkunda, though in a different province 1,s, we ought to measure back these twice five hundred stadia, as the only means of direction that we possess. The following arrangement, therefore, I offer, with all the diffidence that the obscurity of the Journal demands : I have persuaded myself that it is correct; but I should not be sur prized if my deductions should appear inconclusive to others. 1 have followed the only clew I could discover ; and if any one, who has paid attention to the subject, should find better ground to stand on, I shall readily relinquish my own, and yield to superior information.

For we may first observe, that Nelisuram is not only a mart itself, but gives name to a district. This district is not in Canara, but Malabar: the frontier of Malabar, the boundary wall1'7 which runs from the sea to the foot of the Ghauts, is at Dekly, or Dekully, immediately north of Nelisuram. This wall is still visible; and this in a peculiar manner makes it cor respond with Nelkunda, which was the first port in the king dom of Pandion. 2. A second proof may be derived from the name itself, which Orme writes Nellea-serarn. Nella, according to Pao lino188, signifies rice, and Ceram a country ; and if Nella-ceram be the country189 of Nella, Nel-kunda must be the fort of Nella, resembling Gol-conda, Inna-conda, or 19\u00b0Condapoor, on this identical coast of Canara. 3.

The same circum stance is repeated in regard to the distance from Mooziris to Nelkunda : it is five hundred stadia, says our author, or fifty miles, whether you measure by land or sea, or by the space between the two rivers. Pliny la0 does not mention a river at Mooziris, but observes, that it was no desirable place of trade, not only on account of the pirates in the neighbourhood, but because the ships rode at a distance from the shore in the open sea, and boats were employed for the conveyance of their lading, both on the de livery and the reception. The merchants had therefore tried a more convenient port, called Necanydon, where they obtained pepper from a district called Cottona. This is the pepper of Cottondra mentioned in the Periplus, and assigned by every writer to the province of Canara. There is, upon the whole, no essential difference in the two accounts, except the mention of pirates by Pliny not noticed in the journal ; but unless Hydras could be discovered, we cannot ascertain their position : it is supposed to be the Nitria of Ptolemy, the last place upon his Pirate Coast ; and though that is not near Mangaloor, doubtless the pirates roved on the coast of Canara in former ages, as they do now, and pirates there have been at d'llli and the Angedive, as well as in Concan.

Both the Periplus and Pliny certainly consider it as an inferior port to Nelkunda ; for no account of the imports or exports is given here, but at Nelkunda a copious catalogue. That Mooziris continued a place of resort in later times, we mayr conclude from the Peu tingcrian Tables, which place there a temple of Augustus, that is, of the emperor of Rome ; for at the date of the tables, in the time of Theodosius, every emperor was Augustus; and that the Greeks or Romans should have a temple here, is no more extraordinary than that the Christians should have churches in Travancoor, or that the Arabs should have established their superstition in Ceylon, which is a fact asserted by Plin}'. Dodwell has built some arguments on this circumstance, and on the names of the kings, which are the same in Ptolemy, Pliny, and the Periplus, in order to bring down the date of this work to the time of Commodus and Verus. But Paolino affords a solution of this difficulty, which is perfectly satis factory if his etymology be true ; for, he observes that Kepr6 botas is written Celebothras and Cerobothru-s ; and he informs us that Ceram signifies a country, region, or province, and botti, a governor; so that Cerambotti is as manifestly the head or sovereign of a province, as Ceram-perumal is king of the country, compounded of Ceram, a. country, perum \"' great, and aal per sonage, the great personage or sovereign of the kingdom.

'If this etymology be admitted, it accounts for the name of Cer6bothrus in Limurike, and that of Pandion in Malabar, not only in the different ages of Pliny, Ptolemy, and our author, but for as long a period as these divisions of the country continued undisturbed ; for M&dura is still known in India as having; the ancient title of Pandi Mandala, the kino dom of Pandi, or the Pandoos ; and Pandavais was the founder of the sovereignty, according to the Bramins.

The native appellation of Malabar, we are informed by Paolino, is Kerula Ragiam, the Kingdom of Kerula, or Ma layalam, the Mountain Country, derived from the Ghauts which bound it inland, and are visible from a great distance at sea. He adds, that Malangara is an Indian term corrupted into Malabar, and ought not to be deduced from the Arabic mala, a mountain, and bahr, a coast. It is not necessary to assent to this ; because, when the Europeans first visited India, after the discovery of Gama, they derived their information from the Arabs, and consequently adopted their terms. At that time Calicut was the grand mart of the Oriental world ; for here the trade from China and Malacca met the Arabs and Persians, who brought the produce of their own countries, as well as several articles which they procured from Europe; and though M3 Regnabat ibi, cum haec proderem, Celebothras.

When the Portuguese reached the eastern coast of Africa, they were directed neither to Surat or Baroache, but to this city ; and here they found the Arabs settled in the country so powerful and numerous, as to obstruct their commerce, and traverse all the plans they had conceived. According to Barthema\"5, there were not less than fifteen thousand of them settled in this place only, besides numerous bodies of them on the coast, in Ceylon,. and in Coromandel. The influence they had in the country may be calculated, not only from this instance, but from the revenue their com mercial transactions produced ; from their readiness to engage in all the services of war, policy, and government; from the spirit of adventure which appears in all their conduct; 'and above all, from the desire of extending their religion, as well as promoting their individual interest. The character under which Paolino describes them at the present' hour, would probably have suited them in every age. \u2014 \"They \"'are a robust race, \" wearing their beards long and their hair neglected ; they are \" slovenly \"7 in their persons; their complexion is dark, and \" their clothing consists of nothing more than a shirt and \" trowsers of cotton.

The Chinese no longer frequented the port of Calicut21* when the Portuguese arrived in India : they had been ill-treated by the Zamorin, probably at the instigation of the Arabs, and for the same reason which excited their jealousy of the Europeans ; and after a fruitless attempt to revenge themselves, the Chinese ships came no longer to Malabar\"1, but to Maliapatam only in Narsinga, on the coast of Coromandel. Now this trade with the countries farther to the east, and the interest which the Arabs had in the communication, is in full correspondence with the account of Pliny111 in the first centmy, with Ptolemy in the second, with that of Cosmas in the sixth, with the Journal of the Arabs (published by Renaudot) in the ninth, with the experience of Marco Polo in the thirteenth, and K> Paolino says, they make two voyages in produce of the country is pepper, rice, cocoa a year ; but I do not understand how this can nut, coir rope, &c.

DTlli is one of the most conspicuous points on the coast, and, as far as I can discover by the maps, the only remarkable mountain close to the shore.

The venerable Bede131, who died in the year 735, was pos sessed of pepper, cinnamon, and frankincense. Did no one ever ask the question, how, in that age, these luxuries had been conveyed to Britain, or were treasured in a cell at Weir mouth ? But the particular most worthy of remark, is the mention of fine silks [odonoc, Iviptxct] ; for othonion is any web of a fine fabric, and as applied to cotton signifies muslin ; but its usage in this passage, joined with Sericon, plainly indicates the manufacture of the Seres, which is silk. It is mentioned more especially at this port, and particularly distinguished as not being a native commodity, but brought hither from the countries farther 2\" to the east. This is a sufficient proof that Nelkunda was in that age, what Calicut was in later times \u2014 the centrical mart be- tween the countries east and west of Cape Comorin ; and we want no other evidence to prove, that the intercourse between India and the countries beyond the Bay of Bengal, was open in that age, and probably many ages prior, as well as in the time of Ptolemy.

Now that the ancients always meant China Proper by the term Seres, however obscure their notions of it werev seems to admit of proof. Silk came into the Roman world usually by the route of Tartary, the Caspian, and the Euxine sea; and when Justinian procured the silk-worm, he procured it by this northern channel. This communication however, on the north,. could not be opened with the nations of the Golden Cher- sonese, with Ava, Pegu, or Siam, but is expressly marked as formed immediately with the Seres themselves. The point fixed for the meeting of the traders from the west with those of the Seres, was in Tartary, and farther to the 134 north-east than the sources of the Ganges ; and this point, fix it where we please, is perfectly in correspondence with the Kiachta of our own days, where the commodities of the Chinese and Russian empires are exchanged. The jealousy of the Seres in regard to strangers, remarked by Pliny 135, is perfectly charac- teristic of the Chinese in all ages; and whether the communi- cation took place near the Chinese frontier, or in any place nearer to the west, it equally proves that there were Seres on the north, as well as the south ; and that there was one com munication opened by the intervention of Tartary, and another by sea, through the means of the nations in the Golden Cher sonese.

Whether this intercourse by sea was direct, or only by the in tervention of the nations of the Chersonese, is another ques tion ; but on this subject more will be said in its proper place. It seems natural, however, to suppose, that there always was a Malacca, or some port that represented it, where the trade from China met the merchants from India; as the commerce of India met the traders of Arabia and Persia at Calicut, or some port on the coast of Malabar. In this state of things, the Por tuguese found the commerce of the Oriental world ; and in a state very similar, it seems to have existed in the age of the Periplus. This affords us a rational account of the introduction of silk136 into Europe, both by land and sea; and thus by trac ing the commodities appropriate to particular nations, or cli mates, we obtain a clue to guide us through the intricacies of the obscurest as;es. One circumstance respecting the Malabatbrum, which I have supposed to be the Betel, remains still to be considered : it is said to be brought here from the countries farther137 east, and not to be a native commodity. Pepper, and pearls, and ivory, and spikenard X are likewise said to 139 be brought here, as well as silk; all which contribute to ascertain this port as the repre- 236 Silk was not a native commodity or ma nufacture of India in the 16th century ; it still came from China.

Could it then be proved that the hundred and twenty ships which Strabo saw 14\u00b0 at Berenike, actually reached India by a coasting voyage before the monsoon was discovered, we can see a reciprocity of interests, which might very easily induce Pandion to send an embassy to Augustus. Another Indian embassy is said, by Strabo, to have been sent to the same em peror by Porus; and this Porus is supposed,, in Indian history, to be the sovereign of Agimere \u2014 the Rana, or principal of the Rajpout141 rajahs. Now, were it possible to connect his in terests with those of Guzerat, we might prove, that the trade carried on at Barugaza and Nelkunda was of such importance, as to make an intercourse necessary between these two Indian potentates and the emperor of Rome. If an Indian history of these early times should ever be obtained that possessed a degree of consistence or probability, some light might be thrown on this subject ; at present it is mere conjecture and speculation. I cannot quit the contemplation of this catalogue, however, without adverting to the last article on the list, which is the tortois%shell procured from the Golden Isles, and the isles that lie off the coast of Limurike. The first, if not the Maldives, are Khruse; but the latter are the Lackdives : both are still famous for producing the best tortoise-shell, and particularly the black sort\"1, the finest in the world; which is found only here, or at the Philippines, and obtains an higher price than any that is procured elsewhere. But if the Maldives are \"2 Harris, vol. i. p. 716.

This one circumstance might have con vinced d'Anville, if he had attended to it, that Limurike must be Canara, and could not correspond with Concan ; for there are no islands on that coast, where any quantitj' of tortoise-shell could be obtained, sufficient to be considered as an article of general commerce. This extent and value of the cargoes at Nelkunda, either carried out or brought home, is of greater amount than we have found at any other port, and more circumstantial than at any other except Barug&za. This appears correspondent to the course of the trade at present, but still more to the early com merce of the English, when their original factories were at Surat and Tellicheri. At Surat they obtained muslins, chintz, and cottons ; and at Tellicheri, pepper and cardamums : for though the Portuguese multiplied their forts and settlements, the different productions of the north and south, on this western coast of the'peninsula, were obtainable with sufficient facility at these two points. In conformity with this system we find, that throughout the whole which the Periplus mentions o India, we have a catalogue of the imports and exports only at the two ports of Barugaza 144 and Nelkunda145, and there seems See Rennell's corrected Map, and d'An- last century : it was, during the whole of that period, chiefly in the hands of the Moors, i.e. Arabs. ville's. ,\"t That is, Guzerat and Malabar Proper.

I have said that it was dubious whether the author himself had ever been farther than Barug&za ; but so many corroborating circumstances have come out in tracing the account of Nelkunda, that I would now rather six the limit of his voyage at this port. Farther than Ceylon he certainly was not ; and whether the fleets from Egypt ever reached that island previous to the embassy from the king of that country to Claudius, is highly problematical. Indi viduals possibly might have been there upon an adventure, but the amplifications of Pliny and Ptolemy manifestly bespeak an ignorance of the truth in their age ; and if the voyage was not regularly performed, the knowledge of individuals was either not reported, or not believed. XI. IIIPPALUS AND THE MONSOON. There is an additional reason for believing that the regular course of trade terminated at Nelkunda, which is, the intro duction of the discovery of the monsoon lso by Hippalus at this \"\u2022 See Hackluyt, ii. 280.

And for this place I have reserved the discussion of that subject, because, though I shall continue my inquiries as far as Ceylon, I am persuaded that the author of the Periplds went no farther than this port. The history of this I shall give as nearly as possible in the words of the author : \" The whole navigation, such as it has been described from \" Aden 1SI and Kane [to the ports of India], was performed cr formerly in small vessels, by adhering to the shore, and fol \" lowing the indentures of the coast ; but Hippalus was the \" pilot who first discovered the direct course across the ocean, \" by observing the position of the ports, and the general ap \" pearance 1S1 of the sea ; for at the season when the annual \" winds, peculiar to our climate153, settle in the north, and. \" blow for a continuance upon our coast from the Mediter \" ranean ; in the Indian Ocean the wind is constantly to the \" south-west; and this wind, has in those seas obtained the *sl Arabia Felix. sense of the passage is sufficiently clear.

It has been sufficiently proved, that a communi cation was open between India and Arabia previous to the age of Alexander ; and it is impossible to conceive, that those who lived either in India or Arabia, should not have observed the ''*4 K\u00abi 10 Xc-i-res- Tra^-r^isoy kdtey o^&^tw, Ix rss X*^^ i.\\.w7,o's 6,'j. z~i,; i^-ji.^-y yr,s irx^xTXsidc-i -i'<t: TfL>SI\u00a3\u00bbl|iJ.:VfcLC XoX'ZIs'S. excehi- certainly does not express the meaning of the author. ais Tfa^iiXiijofT:;-, if it be not a corruption, has no sense in the lexicons which can apply to this pa.-sage.

It is likewise certain, that vessels frequenting either coast would ac cidentally be caught by either monsoon, and driven across the open sea to the opposite shore, if they happened to be a few days too early, or too late, in the season, for the voyage in which they were engaged. That this had happened, and that there was a direct passage by the monsoons in use between the opposite continents before the Greeks adopted it, has already been noticed from the Periplus, and fully proved. But in almost all discoveries, the previous obstacle is minute, and the removal of it accidental : thus it is, we may suppose, that the few vessels which did find their way to India from the ports of Egypt by adhering to the coast, from the beginning, sailed with the monsoon, both outward and homeward bound; but still followed the track which had been pointed out by Near chus; and it was necessary for an Hippalus to arise, before it should be known, that the winds were as regular and deter minate in the open sea, as upon the coast. The PeripKis assigns the merit of the discovery to the observation of Hippalus himself; but there is nothing unreasonable in supposing, that if he frequented these seas as a pilot or a merchant, he had met with Indian or Arabian traders, who made their voyages in a more compendious manner than the Greeks; and that he col lected information from them, which he had both the prudence and courage to adopt. Columbus owed much to his own. nautical experience and fortitude; but he was not without obli gations to the Portuguese also, who had been resolving the great 7"], [518, "4yo PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. problems in the art of navigation, for almost a century previous to his expedition. But the discovery of the monsoon once made, could never afterwards be neglected ; and the use made of it by the fleets siom Egypt is fully detailed, and much in the same manner by Pliny and the Periplus. The course of the trade from Alex andria to Berenike, and the progress of the voyage from Bere nike to Okelis and Kane, have already been sufficiently de scribed156; but there are some farther circumstances connected with this, which cannot be suppressed without prejudice to the object in view. For Okelis is mentioned by both authors1\" as the better port to remain at ; which is evidently consistent, be cause it is sheltered from the adverse15* monsoon ; and the pas sage of thirty days to Okelis, and forty to the coast of India, is a proportion so striking, that it could be derived from no other source but evidence of the most authentic nature. For the first distance is only about four hundred and eighty miles, and the second near nineteen hundred, and yet that there should be only ten days difference in the longer part of the voyage, is peculiarly appropriate to the two different seas in which the navigation was to be performed. The vessels des tined for India left Berenike about the middle of July, or earlier, if they were to go farther than Barugaza. The passage down the gulph was tedious ; for though the Wind was favour- ,s6 See Kane, supra. made him remove the trade about 15 leagues \" Plin. lib. vi. c. 25. within its mouth, to a fishing-town called \"9 The Immaum finding Aden to lie in- Mocha.

It seems at first sight a contradiction, that vessels which were to have the longer voyage to Malabar, should remain longer at Okelis than those which were destined only for Scindi or Guzerat; but this likewise depends upon a circumstance peculiar to the monsoon upon the coast of India, which appears never to have been noticed by those who have undertaken to comment on the Periplus. It is sufficiently known, that the commencement and ter mination of the two different monsoons are subject to consider able fluctuation ; so that though we say these winds are alter nate, six months each way, we ought to subtract one month from the beginning and ending of each, which are not only fluctuating, but tempestuous.

This is the peculiar circumstance appropriate to the naviga tion of the ancients ; for if we suppose a vessel to leave Berenike on the 10th of July, and to arrive at Okelis the 9th of August ; after continuing there a week, ten days, or a fortnight, she will reach Muziris or Nelkunda, at latest, on the 1st of October ; that is, at the very time when she has reason to expect the best weather of the season. There is another singularity applicable to those vessels which are destined for Scindi and Barugiza, and which stay only three daye at Okelis or Cape Gardefan ; that is, that the south west monsoon sets in \" earlier to the northward of Surat,\" than on the coast to the southward. Whether this circumstance is connected with their voyage, we have no data to determine ; but if the monsoon commences here earlier, it is consequently settled earlier than in Malabar. After thus conducting our fleet to the shores of India, it re mains next to consider their voyage homeward-bound. And 1 The first new moon in September is called commencement of the N.E. monsoon. C.

This allows two months, at least, for the disposal of their cargo, and taking in their lading in exchange. But the latest time of leaving the coast is within the first six days of Machiris ; that is, before the ides of January, or the 13th of that month. Now it is very remarkable, that the original order for the fleets of Portugal was subject to the same regulation; for if they did not sail before the 8th1!3 of December, thev were detained till the first week of the succeeding month. The reason for this, though not mentioned, is doubtless the change of the moon in ,both instances, at which time there are usually some stronger gales ; and in this we have one more evidence of the same operations of nature producing the same effects in all ages. Pliny styles the south-west monsoon, Favonius (which the Periplfts calls Libo-Notus), and the north-east, Vulturnus; about which there is much learned disquisition in Salmasius. But we are now too well acquainted with these seas, to have a doubt remaining on the winds that were intended ; and we con elude, that as the same causes have operated in all ages, they blew two thousand years ago as they blow at the present day. Not that they are fixed to a single point of the compass, but that north-east and south-west are their general direction. It is added by Pliny, that upon reaching the Red Sea, they found a south or south-west wind, which conveyed them to Berenike, and enabled them to conclude their voyage in less than the compass of a year.

If therefore we suppose a vessel to leave the coast of India between the 8th and 13th of January, forty days era ployed upon her return would bring her to Kane, Aden, or Gardefan, towards the end of February. At any of these ports she might wait, so as to be prepared to take advantage of the Gumseen wind in the middle of March ; and when she was once within the straits, this wind would serve her for fifty days to convey her to Berenike, to Myos Hormus, or even to Ar sinoe, the representative of the modern Suez. Thus, by em bracing the opportunities which the regular seasons in the dif ferent seas afford, the whole voyage outward and homeward bound would be performed with a wind constantly in her favour. The next point to be considered is, the departure of this fleet from Okelis, Kane, or Cape Ar6mata. The two last are more particularly intimated by the Periplfts; and Suagros, or Far taque, by Pliny X In this the merchant is most probably the more correct of the two; for, as we may conclude that he per formed the voyage himself, so is Aromata, or Cape Gardefan, the point that divides the limit of the monsoon on the coast of Africa: for, on the authority of Beaulieu, we learn, that he passed from winter, storm, and tempest, to calm and summer, in an instant, on doubling this promontory.

On their return from India, they ran down their longitude first to the coast of Africa, tending to an object of magnitude which they could not miss or overrun ; and then made good their latitude by coming up northward to the coast of Barbaria and the Red Sea. In effecting this we may conclude, that they directed their course, as nearly as they could calculate, to Aromata; but Ptolemy informs us, they sometimes got to the southward of it, and were carried much lower down than they wished ; and sometimes we know that they came intentionally to Rhapta, Opone, and other marts on the coast of Africa, and proceeded afterwards to Arabia, or the Red Sea, according to their destination, interest, or convenience. The commerce of the Arabians has arrested our attention throughout the whole progress of our inquiry, from the first mention of their imports in scripture, to the accounts of the present day. Their connections with the countries in their neighbourhood is equally obvious : in Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Persis, Mesopotamia, and on the Tigris, we find them noticed by Pliny166; in India, by Agatharchides, and almost every subsequent geographer ; in Africa, they are spread at this day from the Red Sea across the whole continent to Senegal ; and in the Eastern Ocean they are found upon every coast, and almost upon every island.

The information to be collected from the little tract of the Periplfis is a picture of geography, in comparison of the two Arabian narratives published by Renaudot, of Ebn Haukal, or Al Edrissi ; besides all the fabulous and the marvellous which we have to remove. Still there are some particulars in these authors already noticed, which are worthy of attention ; and something in the Arabians of Renaudot peculiarly con nected with the object of our inquiry ; for the general fact, that the Indian commerce had settled at Siraf in the ninth century, is a revolution of importance. Siraf168 is upon the same coast in the Gulph of Persia as the modern Gomroon, and held the same rank at that time as Keish in the thirteenth century, and Ormus of a later date. The merchants of Siraf, in that age, evidently performed the voyage to China, and Chinese ships are mentioned at Siraf; but a closer examination has induced me to believe169 that they Avere not Chinese, but vessels employed by the Siraf merchants in the trade to China. The trade from this port, however it ex tended farther to the east, certainly met the Chinese fleets on f?

P. 8. Eng. ed. I do not, however, think this proof so con clusive, as utterly to deny the navigation of the Chinese west of Malabar. a6S It is written Shiraff, Sharraf, and, by M'Cluer, Charrack, pronounced Sharrack. *6* In the port of London, a China ship is a ship destined for China ; and in this sense, per haps, the Arab says, that most of the Chinese ships take in their cargo at Siraf. He describes s~"], [525, "INDIA 477 the coast of Malabar; for there it is mentioned, that the Chinese paid a duty of a thousand 17\u00b0 drams, while other vessels paid no more than from one dinar to ten. But the ships that sailed from Siraf went first to Mascat in Arabia, for the same reason that the fleets from Egypt took their departure from Kane and Aromata ; that is, because they obtained the monsoon the moment they were under sail. The Arab has fortunately preserved this circumstance; for he sajrs, \" from Mascat to Kaucammali is a month's171 sail, with \" the wind aft.\" Here then we have an evidence of the mon soon, and of the passage direct from one coast to the other, in harmony with the Periplus : we have a passage of thirty days from Maskat, proportionate to the forty days from Gardefan ; and whatever Kaucam may be, we find in, Mali a reference to Male and Malabar, in which we cannot be mistaken. Al Edrissi, who copies this passage from the Arabs, writes the name 171Kulam-meli ; so that between the two authorities we may possibly discover Kulam on the coast of Malabar; and on that coast, in the kingdom of Travancore, there is still the port of Coulan173, about eighty miles below Cochin; and another 2'c Two Arabs.

There seems to be more coasting in this voyage than in that of Ptolemj7 ; for he carries his fleets across from some point in the Carnatic to the Golden Chersonese, at once. But if his communication terminated there, the Arabs went farther east than his Sinus Magnus, and reached Canfu 177 in China, which is the modern Canton, where they traded much under the same restrictions which Europeans experience at the present hour. After all, they confess that very few of their ships reached China ; that the voyage was extremely dangerous 1?9, and that water-spouts and tuffons were continually to be dreaded ; added to which, at the date of their narrative in 867 of our era, the kingdom of China itself was distracted by internal commotions17*, which made it no longer safe for merchants to venture into the country. But still it should be remembered, that the Arabians are the first navigators upon record, except the merchants of Cosmas, that penetrated to China ; that they are antecedent to the Europeans in this voyage by more than six centuries ; and that they had found their way to the northern l8\u00b0 frontier of this king- cannot discover; but the Arab says, he was acquainted with one, who had seen a man that had travelled on foot [by lend]] from Samar cand to Canfu [Canton] with a load of Musk ; and had traversed all the cities of China one after another.

We have no record of any European ,Sl visiting this country by a northern route before Marco Polo, in the twelfth century ; nor any satisfactory account of an European181 sailing in the sea of China between the time of that traveller and Nicola di Conti, in 1420. Barthema's voyage is between 1500 and 1504, im mediately preceding the arrival of the Portuguese. These circumstances will naturally suggest reflections in re gard to the Arabs of the Desert, and the Arabs on the coast. The, sons of Esau were plunderers by prescription and profes sion ; their hand was against every man, and every man's hand against them. The family of Jocktan l83, in Yemen, Hadra maut, and Oman, were as naturally commercial ; and as they anticipated the Greeks and Romans in the navigation to India, and the modern Europeans in the discovery of China, it is no more than their clue to ascribe to them a spirit of commerce, enterprize, or the thirst of gain, in ages which no history can reach'; and to conclude, that if the precious commodities of the East found their way to the Mediterranean, as undoubtedly they did, the first carriers on the ocean were as undoubtedly the Arabians.

He gives a very rational account of the pepper trade in Malabar, and the meeting of the mer chants from the East with those of Europe, from the Red Sea, and Gulph of Persia, in Ceylon, which in his age was the centre of this commerce ; and he affords a variety of informa tion, which the Arabians either did not know, or have not re gorded. But we shall have recourse to him again when we arrive at Ceylon. I have more than once noticed the Rajah, who, as Pliny \"in forms us, attended the embassy from the king of Ceylon to Claudius, and who asserted, that his father had visited the Seres. I once thought that this Rajah went by sea ; but upon a closer inspection of the passage, it is plain that he passed by land from Bengal across the mountains called Emodi. Still we have, upon the whole, a proof, that through the intervention of different nations, a communication was open from the Red Sea to the country of the Seres. Whether the Seres are Chinese, has been disputed ; but that they were visited by sea, is true, if the evidence of Cosmas184 is sufficient; and that they were approachable by land through Tartary on the north, is asserted likewise by Pliny and Ptolemy. This is a peculiarity that suits no nation but the Chinese; and if we find this fact recorded from the t;me that history commences, it is a strong pre sumption that the same intercourse took place many ages 1,4 Cosmas calls them Tzinitz\u00e6, and Tzinist\u00e6. See Dissertation ii. infra, 3.Q VOL. II."], [530, "PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. 482 antecedent to the accounts which have come down to the pre sent time. Whether the author of the Periplus himself sailed with the monsoon, or by the coasts which his narrative takes in succes sion, he has not informed us ; but if he was in India more than once, he might have tried both the different routes. His leav ing this circumstance undetermined, may induce a suspicion that he was a geographer, rather than a voyager. But the same circumstance occurs in Capt. Hamilton's Account of the East Indies : he gives the ports in succession, from the Cape of Good Hope to China; yet he certainly did not visit them all in one voyage, but gives us the result of the knowledge he had acquired in a'll his different navigations. For this account of the monsoons, and the effects produced by them relative to the commerce of the ancients, no apology is requisite : it is of the very essence of the design proposed from the commencement of this work, which was intended not merely as a comment on the Peripltis, but from the oppor tunities afforded by that journal to investigate the commerce of the East in all its branches ; to trace its progress or situation in different ages, -and to examine its relations, causes, and con sequences, till the new \u00a3ra of discovery commenced by the efforts of the Portuguese, under the auspices of Don Henrv' and the great work was essentially completed by the achieve ments of Gama and Columbus. We return now to the narrative of the Journal, which w;-s interrupted at Barake, for the purpose of introducing Hippalus to the acquaintance of the reader, and commences a^ain at Ela-Bakare, altered as to its orthography, in which it now"], [531, "INDIA. 483 corresponds with the Beccare of Pliny, and the Bakare of Pto- lemy. It is now likewise augmented with the addition of Ela; in which, as has been observed, we recover the Eli of Marco Polo, and the d'Eli or d'llli of our charts. In this passage there is mention of the Ruddy Mountain X and then an omis- sion in the text, which requires examination before we can pro- ceed. I have lately learnt that dTlli itself is not red, but that there are red hills, or land, both to the north and south of it : the red hill to the south, lying near the sea, is that which we must prefer for the Ruddy Mountain of the Journal ; and as the features of nature are indelible, it is much satisfaction to establish the consistency of the narrative upon ground so well ascertained. I consider this, therefore, as a point fixed ; but I ought not to omit, that the Oriental Navigator186 notices red cliffs much lower down, both on the north and south of An jenga; and as we are approaching very fast to Cape Comorin, if it should appear preferable to others to assume these for the Ruddy Mountain, there is confessedly some ground for the supposition.

No representative of Calicut appears, and probably it did not then exist, nor for several centuries afterwards. The Kolkhi of the ancients has been frequently mistaken for it ; but as Kolkhi is beyond Comorin, and is the seat of the Pearl Fishery, the supposition is impossible. Calicut1*5 was the grand centre, for many ages, of all the Eastern and Western com merce, from its origin in 805 w till the arrival of the Portu guese ; and though its splendour is now eclipsed, it is still a place of great trade for pepper1\", cardamums, sandal-wood, and other commodities ; much frequented by the vessels of 558 There is ?.

These are circumstances too well known to be insisted on ; and we must proceed to Comar, no less conspicuous in its situation at the apex of the peninsula, than in the preservation of its name through so many ages, and so many revolutions both of commerce and of empire. At Komar there was an harbour and a fortress, with a gar rison : there was likewise some religious establishment, in which those who dedicated themselves to the worship of the presiding deity first consecrated themselves by ablutions, and then en tered into an engagement of celibacy. Women partook of this institution as well as men ; and the legend of the place reports, that the goddess to whom their services were dedicated, used formerly to practise the same ablutions monthly at this consecrated spot. The name of* the place, according to Paolino 15d, is derived from Cumari, a virgin deity, the Diana and Hecate of the Hindoo mythology. The convent197, he adds, still exists, and the same superstition is practised at a mountain three leagues inland, where they still preserve the tradition of Cumari's bathing in the sea. The Sanscreet name, he adds, is Canya muri, Cape Virgin^ but contracted by the natives themselves 398 Cumari, he informs us, signifies a virgin ; but Comr is the moon, in Arabic ; and Diana (as Ph\u0153be) is the goddtss of the moon, the sister of Ph\u0153bus.

The Pearl Fishery is not now, nor ever was, carried on to the westward or northward of Cape Comorin. The centre of it has always been at Manar, or on the coast in the neighbourhood ; and Manar 30S is the island of Epioddrus, where, according to the Peripltis, the pearl oysters were only to be found ; and there is the fishery at the present hour. From the mention of Epioddrus, we may conclude a Greek of that name from Egypt was the first of his countrymen that visited this island ; and where would a Greek not have gone306, if he had heard that pearls were to be obtained?

The Nayque of Madura, who was sovereign of the coast, and the representa tive of Pandion, had one day's fishery ; the Governor of Manar's wife, when the Portuguese were masters, had another day, afterwards perverted to the use of Jesuits ; and the owner of the vessel had one draught every fishing-day. After the fishery was concluded, the fair was kept at Tutacorin. The brokerage and the duty amounted to four per cent. \u2014 paid by the seller. The vessels were not fewer than four or five hundred, each carrying from sixty to ninety men, of which one-third were divers. Capt. Stevens supposes the pearl of Manar to be inferior to that of Bahrein. This fishery is likewise described by Cesar Frederick, and a variety 3\u00b09 of authors. He informs us, that the divers were chiefly Christians of Malabar in his time; they are now a mix ture of that description, of Roman Catholics, and Hindoos; but the superstitions practised to preserve the divers from the sharks, and other dangers of their profession, are all Hindoo. Several fanatics are well paid for their attendance during the fishery for that purpose ; and the sharks are as obedient to the conjuration of a Bramin, as they could be to a Malabar priest : the charm is not always efficacious ; but the priests of India, like the priests of Delphi, have a ready salvo for their failure.

The Periplus seeifis to confirm this idea, and Ptolemy has no thing to the contrary ; but if the opening in Adam's Bridge, near Manar313, was no deeper at that day than at present, no ship of burden314 could have passed it. Pliny's account states, that throughout the whole of the straits the depth was not more than six feet; but that there were particular openings3'5, so deep that no anchor could reach the ground. He is likewise so de ceived in the position of the island, as to make the ambassadors sent to Claudius astonished at seeing the shadows fall to the north ; not reflecting that in their own country, if he had known its situation, they must have made the same observation an nually, when the sun was to the south of the equator.

This is in 1656 : it is pos sible they are now immovcable, by neglect or disuse. The fishery is usually on the Ceylon side ; as at the Seewel Bank, 20 miles-west of Ari poo, Condatchey, &c. Ibid.

But then Eratosthenes adds, that it extends eight314 thousand stadia towards Africa; that is, according as we compute the stadium, either eight hundred, or a thousand miles, in a direction exactly the reverse of truth. In this I am forced to confess, that the Periplus has followed Eratosthenes, and added to his error; for it is stated in express terms, that it reaches almost to the coast of Azania313, which 3,3 From Dondra Head to Tellipelli, 270 *\u00bb* Strabo, p. 72. 5000 ; p. 690. 8000. miles ; from Colombo to Trincole, J 60. \u2014 33; Kal Ii; to xar \u00abktbs wtrvKveui&ipxm Hugh Boyd, in the India Ann.

In some account of this sort exists the cause of the error in the Arabian geographers; for Al Edrissi has confounded Cape Comorin, or Comari, with Co mar316, that is, the island of Madagascar; and in his map he has actually placed Madagascar to the eastward of Ceylon. This arises from his extension of the coast of Africa to the East till it reaches the sea of China, and the necessity he was under of making Madagascar parallel to the coast of Zanguebar. It is with concern that I mention these errors, in which the author of the Periplus is involved, and upon account of which I am constrained to allow his want of information in every thing beyond Nelkunda, and to confess that his personal knowledge did not extend to Ceylon. Strabo supposes Ceylon not to be less than Britain, and Josephus317 conceives Britain not less than the rest of the habitable world : these, indeed, are expressions at random ; but what shall be said of the amplification318 of Ptolemy, who makes its 3lS It seems to admit of proof, that Al Edrissi has made two islands out of Ceylon, instead of one. Saranda, he says, (p. 28.) is I2CO miles in circumference; and Sarandib (p. 31.) is 80 miles long and 80 miles broad. And yet that Saranda is Ceylon, as well as Sarandib, appears manifest, by his placing the Pearl Fishery there, and making it a great resort of merchants for spices. He has a dif ferent mistake about Comar, or Comr ; for Cape Comorin, and Comr the island of Mada gascar, are confounded. In p. 31. Comr is a very long island [or country] the king of which lives in Malai. This is evidently the which lived in Malabar; and the island Saran dib lies seven days sail from it, which is the distance given by the ancients. But p. 34. we have Comr again, one day's sail from Da gutta : now this is Madagascar; for Dagutta is in Sofala. Perhaps, if we ever obtain a scientific translation of Al Edrissi, we may find distinctions to obviate this confusion ; for his translator, Gabriel, knew as little of Ceylon as of Russia. 327 Strabo, p. 130.

His errors descended much later than could have been supposed ; for Marco Polo 31\u00b0 mentions this island as two thousand four hundred miles in circuit; and adds, that it had formerly been three thousand six hundred, but part of it had been swallowed up by tempest and inundation. And even so late as sixty years before the discovery of Gama, Nicola di Conti supposes the circumference to be two thousand miles.

My purpose in producing these facts is not to expose the errors of ancient writers on the subject, but to shew how un certain all information is, when grounded upon report. And yet, in the midst of this darkness, Ptolemy's information was such as, in one instance, to confirm the rank which he so de servedly holds in preference to others ; for he gives the names of places more correctly, and more conformably to modern intelligence, than appear in any other author, Greek, Latin, 3,5 I am not certain that the amplification 33\u00b0 Not Nicolas di Conti, unless upon his of M.

This is a merit peculiar to him, not only here, but in the remotest and least known regions of the world : it proves that his inquiries were made at Alexandria of merchants or mariners, who had actually visited the countries he describes ; but that they had not the means of giving true positions, be cause they had neither instruments for observation, or the com pass to mark their course. The North Polar Star was not visible ; and if they sailed by the Canobus in the southern hemisphere, as Ptolemy asserts they did, that star is not within twenty-seven degrees of the Pole, and would give occasion to a variety of mistakes. Still, under all these disadvantages, it is something to have procured names that we can recognize ; and these names at once put ah end to the dispute formerly agitated among the learned, whether the Taprobana of the ancients were Ceylon or Sumatra. They prove likewise, that some merchants, or travellers, had reached the capital and interior of the island. By them the capital was found where Candy now is, and called Maa-grammum331, the great city, or metropolis, which was placed on the river Ganges, still called the Ganga, Gonga, or Ma-vali-gonga, the great river of Bali331, which flows to Trinco malee.

This is denied by d'Anville, who by separating the two capes, makes Kory, the point of the continent, at Ramiseram ; and then supposes Kalligicum to be Kalymere, or Kallamedu. This may be true or not, but it carries us away from the intention of the author; for Ptolemy has nothing to correspond with the northern head of Ceylon, now called Point Pedro33'; but he makes his Boreum, or northern cape, erroneously indeed, opposite to Kdry ; aud his three Kdrys, on the continent, on the intermediate island and on Ceylon, are in perfect correspondence with circumstances actually existing.

The bridge itself, formed by the shoals between Rami-ceram and Manar, is Rama's Bridge : and in Rami-ceram is Raman-Koil, the temple of Ram.

But Koil, whether we consider it,. with Ptolemy, as the point of the continent, or seek for it on the island of Ramiseram 343, is so near, and so intimately con- nected with Manar, the principal seat of the fishery, that there can be little hesitation in assigning it to the Kolkhi of the an- cients. Whether there be now a town of consequence either on the continent or the island, I am not informed ; but that Koil, and Kolis, and Kolkhi, and Kalli-gicum344, arc related, I have no doubt. The Kolkhi of Ptolemy is on the coast, indeed, previous to a river called Solen ; and such a river appears in Rennell's Map, with the name of Sholavanden applied to a town on its bank; ings on this island, except those about the pagoda. The conflux of pilgrims is immense. Coil, in the Tamul language, signifies a temple.

If there fore we adhere to Ptolemy, the issue of this river would give the position of Kolkhi to a certainty ; but the description of the Periplus would lead us directly to Koil, on the island Rami ceram ; for it is there said, that the Bay of Argalus succeeds immediately next to Kolkhi. Now the Argalus of the Periplus is the Orgalus of Ptolemy, which he places instantly subsequent to his promontory Koru ; and if we suppose this promontory to be the extreme point of the continent north of Rami-ceram, which it is, we obtain the position of the Kolkhi of the Peri plus, without a doubt. The island K6ru of Ptolemy is placed at a distance from the main, erroneously, as all his islands are; but as it is certainly the same as Rami-ceram, and Rami-ceram is separated from the continent only by a narrow channel, the island Koru and the cape Koru may therefore have been brought into one. I certainly think that Koru, Kolis, Kolkhi, and Koil, are the same ; but I am not so much led by the name, as by the position assigned to Kolkhi in the Periplus, immediately preceding the Bay of Argalus. My own deductions on this question, I must confess, are contrary to Ptolemy ; and his authority has induced d'Anville, 345 Solen, in its original sense, is a pipe or flute, which the oblong muscle may be sup posed to represent, but not the pearl oyster. Perhaps this muscle was found in the river, without relation to the fishery. I learn from Capt. Mackenzie, that there is a fishery on this side of the strait nearest the continent, called Chanque, carried on along a range called the Low or Flat Islands. The river, as d'An ville has observed, divides inland, and falls into the sea by two mouths \u2014 one on each side of Koru. D'Anville, Antiq. del'Inde, p. 123. As. Researches, vol. vi. p. 426. Chanquo, the native term for the pearl oyster, according to Salmasius, is derived from Concha, and re ceived from the Greek and Roman traders. 1 129. But Chanquo is not the pearl oyster, according to Bald\u00e6us in Churchill, iii. 648. May it not be the muscle^ vifhich bears pearl, so strenuously insisted on by Bruce I"], [553, "INDIA, 505 Rennell, and Robertson, to assume Kilkhare which is at the mouth of the river. It is but reasonable to conclude, that the concurrence of witnesses so eminent will prevail against the evidence of the Peripliis, and any thing that I have to offer in its favour. Still, however, it is just to state the question fairly, and leave the determination to those who may chuse to scru tinize it more precisely. On one point all testimonies agree; which is, that Kolkhi cannot be Coleche, as Paolino with much confidence asserts ; for it is impossible that it should be to the west of Cape Comorin. r From the fishery we may proceed to the island itself; and the most distinct knowledge we have of Ceylon from the ancients, is found in Cosmas Indicopleustcs, whose narratives are as faithful as his philosophy is erroneous. He tells us honestly, .that he was not at Ceylon himself, but had his account from Sopatrus, a Greek, whom he met at Adooli, but who died five-and-thirty years previous to his publication345. This affords us a date of some importance; for it proves that the trade, opened by the Romans from Egypt to India direct, continued upon the same footing from the reign of Claudius and the dis covery of Hippalus, almost down to the year 500 of our era ; by which means we come within three hundred and fifty years of the Arabian Voyage published by Renaudot, and have but a small interval between the limits of ancient geography and that of the moderns. Sopatrus, as his name testifies, was a Greek ; and I have not yet met with the name of a single Roman engaged in this 346 Montfaucon sixes the last date of Cosmas's publication in 535. 3t VOL. 11."], [554, "5o6 PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. trade347. Perhaps the jealousy of the emperors, which did not allow Roman citizens to enter Egypt without permission, had likewise forbidden them to embark in these fleets. But the in telligence derived from Sopatrus is so perfectly consistent with all that has hitherto been adduced, and so correspondent to the Arabian accounts, which commence only three hundred and fifty years later, that it carries with it every mark of veracity that can be required. For Cosmas reports, from the testimony of Sopatrus : I. That the Taprobana of the Greeks is the Sieli-diba of the Hindoos; that it lies beyond the Pepper Coast, or Malabar; and that there is a great number of small islands [the Maldives] in its neighbourhood, which are supplied with fresh water, and produce the cocoa-nut in abundance. The cocoa-nut he calls Argellia ; and Argel, or Nargel, I am informed, is the Arabic name of the cocoa-palm tree. He adds, that it is nine hundred miles in length and breadth, which he deduces from a native measure of three hundred gaudia ; by which, if he means cir cumference,his computation is nearer to the truth than that of the more ancient writers. But the most remarkable circumstance is, that the gaudia, written ghadia, is to this day a native measure of the Ceylonese; it is the same as the naliguai of Tamoul, equal to three-eighths of a French league, or nearly a mile and a quarter English. If therefore we consider that his miles are Roman, 900 Roman miles compared with 660 English, is an amplification very moderate **, compared with the enormity of other ancient authors. 3\u00ab The freedman of Plokamus, who reached he was himself probably a Iftertus of Claudius.

He acquaints us next, that there were two kings on the island: one called the King 'of the Hyacinth X that is, the country above the Ghauts, where the ruby and other precious stones were found ; and a second king, possessed of the re mainder, in which were the harbour and the mart, that is, the low country on the coast, where, in different ages, the Arabians, the Portuguese, Dutch, and English, have been established. On the coast also, he says, there were Christians from Persia, with a regular Christian church, the priests and deacons of which were ordained in Persia ; that is, they were Nestorians, whose catholicos resided at Ctesiphon, and afterwards at Mosul : in fact, they were the same as the Malabar Christians of St. Thomas, and occupied nearly the whole of the low country on the coast, while the native sovereigns, above the Ghauts, were Hindoos. III. Another-particular we obtain is, that in the age of So patrus, Ceylon was considered as the centre of commerce be tween China and the Gvilph of Persia and the Red Sea. The Chinese he calls Tzinitzes35\"; a most remarkable term, express ino- the natives of the Cheen, or Ma-cheen, of the Arabs; that is, either the peninsula of Malacca, or China itself; most pro bably the latter, because he mentions the same particulars as Ptolemy and Pliny assign to the Seres ; that they inhabit the country farthest to the east, and that there is nothing but sea beyond it. 349 The ruby of Ceylon is proverbial.

These articles are exchanged with Male, or the Pepper Coast ; or with Kalliana [Tana], which supplies in return brass, sesamum-wood 3SS, and cottons. Its commerce likewise extends to the Sindus, where the castor, musk, and spikenard, are found; and to the gulph of Persia, to the coast of Arabia, and to Adooli ; while the several com modities of these countries are again exported from Ceylon to the East.

Another circumstance is noticed, which con tinues true to this day ; which is, that the importation of horses from Persia pays no duty.

The horse is said not even to breed on the whole western side of the peninsula ; or if by acci dent a foal is dropped, it is worth nothing. VIII. The last circumstance I shall notice is, a conference between the king of Ceylon and Sdpatrus, in presence of a Persian, who had boasted of the power of his sovereign : \u00ab Well ! Roman,\" says the king, \" what have you to say ?\" \" Look,\" replied Sopatrus, \" at the coins of Rome and Persia : \" that of the Roman emperor is of gold, well wrought, splendid, \" and beautiful ; while that of Persia is an ordinary silver \u2022\" drachma.\" The argument was conclusive; the Persian was disgraced, and Sopatrus was placed upon an elephant and paraded through the city in triumph. Vain as this circum stance may appear, two extraordinary particulars attend it ; for the king's address to Sopatrus is, Roomi 36\u00b0, the term still used in India to express any inhabitant of those countries which once formed the Roman empire ; and the second is, that the Persians of that day actually had no gold361 coin, while the coins of Byzantium were the purest and finest in the world. vol. ii. p.9'8. from Procopius, lib. iii. cap. 33. See Cosmas also, p. 148. 360 Pw;j.lu. If Cosmas had not meant to give \u2022the very word of the Ceylonese, he would have written Pii^ais. In India the Turks are called Roomi, as possessing Constantinople, the seat of the Roman emperors. The exclusion of the Persian coin is the very circumstance that took place upon this occa sion ; and it should seem, that as the Greek coins of Bactria, &c. had been current when the merchant of the Periplus was at Barugaza, the Roman coin had now the preference, as the Imperial dollars, Venetian sequins, and Spanish piastres, have had a superiority in later times. For the purity of the Roman mint at Constantinople, see Clark on Coins. 3dI I cannot help transcribing a passage as I found it by accident in Mascou's History of the Germans : Monetam quidam argenteam Persarum Rex arbitratu suo cudere consuevit.

The hippopotamus he never saw, but obtained only some of his teeth ; and the unicorn he never saw, but as it was represented in brass in the palace of the king of Abyssinia. I mention these circumstances to prove the fidelity of the traveller; for truth is as conspicuous in what he did not, as in what he did see. And after this extract, selected out of his voluminous work, if no thing equally precise or satisfactory is to be collected out of the Arabian writers, or Oriental accounts of any sort, let it not be deemed prejudice or partiality, if we prefer Greek or Roman authorities to all that can be found in any other ancient history whatsoever. One part of the question has, however, eluded all my in quiries ; which is, that I have not found the mention of cinna mon, as a native361 of Ceylon, in any author whatsoever. lambulus, Pliny, Dioscorides, Ptolemy363, the author of the Periplils, and Cosmas, are all equally silent on this head, and if I recollect rightly, they have the head of the kings ; but I do not remember whether they are all silver. passage we have the produce of Taprobana \u2014 ivory, tortoise-shell, and other articles ; and here I should have expected to find cinnamon, if the author had noticed it as a native of the island. 362 It is mentioned by Matthioli, and in the preface to Ribeyro's History of Ceylon (Fr. ed.) that Strabo notices cinnamon from Cey lon. I have not found the passage ; but at p. 63. I find the regio Cinnamomifera and Taprobana joined under the same parallel, which perhaps may have led to such a suppo sition ; and again, p. 72. but in the latter 5<3 The language of Ptolemy is precise : he says rice, honey, ginger, the beryl, the ruby, gold, silver, and all other metals, elephants and tigers, are found in Taprobana ; but does not mention cinnamon.

That the ancients ob tained the best and purest cinnamon, we know from their de scription of it ; and that best sort grows no where but in Ceylon. That they might be deceived in regard to its origin, while they went only to Tyre, Sabea, or the coast of Africa, is natural; but that they should not recognize it in Ceylon, when some merchants went thither in tiie age of the Periplus, and in all succeeding ao-es down \"to the lime of Sopatrus and Cosmas, is unaccountable. No voyagers, travellers, or writers, pretended to have visited Ceylon personally, except lambulus and Sopatrus. I know not how to excuse even Sopatrus, who was only once there casually; but against lambulus, who asserted that he had re sided in Ceylon seven years, the charge of fiction is almost direct : no one could have been resident so long, without see ing cinnamon, the staple of the island ; and that if he had seen it, he should not have recorded it among the other particulars lie detailed, is\" incredible; for the curiosity of Greece344 and Egypt was as much alive to this inquiry, as to any one that regarded the produce of the East. Dioscorides 365 and Galen knew it not. Diony'sius, who lived under Augustus, preserves the fable of Herodotus, that birds 364 Cinnamon seems to have been the first The English had employed Genoese, Ragusan, spice sought after, or procured, in all Oriental Sicilian, Candian, Venetian, Spanish, and Por voyages, both ancient and modern.

I do not pretend to have explored the whole range of antiquity on this subject; but the first mention of cinnamon, as the produce of Ceylon, that has occurred to me, is in the Scholiast366 of Dionysius on this very passage. Whether that circumstance will prove the early date of that knowledge, or the low date of the Scholiast, must be left for others to determine. Sir William Jones has taken ample notice of this obscurity, and remarks upon the Cinnamon 'Country of the ancients in Africa, the limit of their geography to the south, that it-does not produce a single specimen of this article in the present age, or in any former age, which can be ascertained. Bruce, however, maintains, that the finest cin namon was found in Adel, or about Cape Aromata, and pro bably transplanted thence to Ceylon ; but why should any merchants carry the plant to Ceylon, which was more distant, cinnamon) is said to come from Arabia, and the ancient cinnamon, or sprig of the tree, from Mosyllon.

Matthioli adds, p. 46. that Strabo likewise says, cinnamon comes from the south ern parts of India ; but I have not yet met with the passage. Pliny follows Theophtrastus. See also the curious account (p. 45.) that Galen gives of the cinnamon in possession of Trajan, Adrian, Antoninus, Commodus, and Severus ; in all which relations not a word is found respecting its origin from Ceylon : those who would examine it, as now cultivated in that island, may consult Thunberg, vol. iv. 199. tpvXXx Qtptns dxti(Xo-'tm xs-jafj.ifj.uy.

Still Bruce is not singular ; for the Periplfts not only notices cinnamon as a native produce, but asserts it in contra distinction367 to other articles which were in the country only by importation. Bastard cinnamon is found in Malabar, and true cinnamon, though of an inferior quality, in Sumatra; per haps also in other islands farther to the east; but that the best growth has been constantly in Ceylon, from all the evidence before us, is undeniable. The spice we now have, which is the kasia of the ancients, was certainly procured in Africa ; and the testimony of the Peri plus is direct368, that it grew there. I state this with all its difficulties, which I cannot solve; but as there was a voyage constantly performed, from Barug&za to Africa, previous to the Greeks having any knowledge of such an intercourse, the only possible solution to be imagined is, that the merchants engaged in this commerce kept the secret to themselves : they imported it at Barug&za from Ceylon, and exported it to Sab\u00a3a, where it was first found by the traders from Egypt, by Solomon, and the Tyrians ; and in a later age, to the ports of Africa, where they dealt immediately with the Greeks, without suffering by the monopoly of the Sabeans. How such a secret could be kept so long a time, or how the Greeks could be persuaded that kasia grew in Africa, is, with such lights as we have, in scrutable; but that it was not the produce of Africa, is suffi- JC7 Periplus, p. 8. vpx'-'s\" & \u00bbc ri Ifiiro- 368 Periplus, p. 8.

It is true, however, that the fleets which conveyed it from Guzerat to the coast of Africa must likewise have brought it to Arabia ; for from Arabia the Tyrians and Greeks of Egypt first procured it : and when the Greeks afterwards went to Aromata, Mosullon, and the ports of Adel, it is evident that they found a cheaper market there than at Aden, Kane, or Moosa ; for in Sabea it was a monopoly. That cinnamon came to Maketa [Mocandon] and the province of OmanT we are assured by Arrian ; and thai it was imported there direct from Guzerat, is much more probable than that it should be brought by a cir cuitous course from Africa : and yet it seems very extra ordinary that this spice should not be noticed among the im ports or exports of the Gadrosian O'mana, which was mani festly, in the age of the Peripltis, established as a centre of all the commerce which passed between India on the east, and Arabia on the west. One circumstance worthy of remark is still to be considered ; which is, that the merchant of the Periplus mentions kasia only, and never cinnamon. Cinnamon, as we have learnt from Galen, was a present for kings and emperors; but the kasia, the canna fistula, or pipe cinnamon, which we now have, was the only article of merchandize in that age, as it still con tinues. And now that Ceylon is in the hands of the English, it would be no difficult matter to obtain the tender spray of the four principal sorts noticed by Thunberg, and compare them with the accounts of Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Galen. As the species which we have answer to their kasia, 3u 2"], [564, "Si6 PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHREAN SEA. it is highly probable that the spray would answer to their cin namon ; for that both were from the same plant, or from dif ferent species of the same, there can be little doubt, as Galen acquaints us, that in the composition of medicines a double3* portion of kasia answered the same purpose as a single one of cinnamon ; and that both entered into the theriac which he pre- pared for the emperor Severus. Such is the account that has appeared necessary to be stated relative to the ancient situation of this celebrated island. The modern history of it may be obtained from Baldeus, Valentine, Knox, Ribeyro, Harris, Hugh Boyd 37\u00b0, Le Beck; Captains Mahoney, Colin M'Kensie, and Percival.

To these the traders from Limtarike5, and the other provinces north6 of Limurike, resort; and in these marts are REMARKS. dubious. If we were to examine a catalogue of muslins at an India sale, we should find many names more strange than Ebargeitides, derived either from the manu factures, or the place where procured. See the Catalogue. (c) Where to fix any of these three places is mere conjecture : our course is still east, according to the Periplus ; but if Kamara be the Chaberis Emporium of Pto lemy, as Mercator supposes, his Podooka is still higher up the coast, and our course ought to be north-east ; and if his Manarpha be Maliarpha, or Meliapoor, that place is the St. Thome of Madras ; in which case Podooka must be fixed somewhere on the coast between rite Cavery and Madras, but where, it is impossible to determine. Sopatma is not noticed by Ptolemy. Soro-patma would be the town of the Sorse, with some allusion to the Sor\u00e6 of Ptolemy and to Coromandel ; but it is all con jecture ; and yet, notwithstanding this obscurity, we have manifestly a trade here described, regularly carried on by native traders, between Malabar and Coromandel *, without the least notice of Greeks being concerned in it. We have an account that the specie brought by the Greeks to Canara, finally settled on the other side of the peninsula ; and as we know that in all ages the commerce of India cannot be carried on without specie, so we see here its regular progress to the eastward. We are in formed also, that the exports of Egypt to Canara, and the produce of Canara itself, went by the same conveyance to Coromandel \u2022, and that the principal articles in return were the muslins, as they are at this day : the merchants from Guzerat and Concan partook in this trade, and possibly those from Scindi. In the whole of this, without being able to specify particular places, we have a general picture of Indian commerce, so conformable to the accounts of the Arabs, and of the Portuguese upon their first arrival on the coast, that we want no further evidence to persuade us, that NOTES.

The different sorts of vessels constructed in these ports are likewise correspondent to modern accounts : the monoxy'Ia are still in use, not canoes, as they are sometimes improperly rendered ; but with their foundation formed of a single timber, hollowed, and then raised with tiers of planking till they will contain ioo or 150 men. Vessels of this sort are employed in the intercourse between the two coasts ; but the kolandiophonta, built for the trade to Malacca, perhaps to China, were exceedingly large and stout, resembling probably those described by Marco Polo and Nicola di Conti. Barthema likewise mentions vessels of this sort at Tarnasari (Masulipatam ?), that were of 1000 tons (dolia ?) bur then (lib. vi. c. 12. Gryn\u00e6us), designed for this very trade to Malacca. This is the more remarkable, as d'Anville fixes the M\u00e6solia of Ptolemy at Masulipatam ; and Ptolemy's point of departure for Khruse, or Malacca, at the Godavery, twenty-six leagues only to the north. From these circumstances there is great reason to conclude that he is right ; for Barthema had come from the Straits of Manar to Puleachat, north of Madras, and then proceeded to Tarnasari, where he embarked for Bengal, Pegu, and Malacca. How extraordinary, then, is the correspondence of the Periplus with the modern course of these navigators, from the Straits of Manar to the Car natic ! and from the Carnatic, passing the wild tribes of Orissa (still savage) between the Godavery and the Ganges ; and then proceeding to Malacca, or the Golden Chersonese ! Still however, with all this accuracy, he is in the same error with Ptolemy, carrying the whole course east till he reaches Desarene or Orissa, and then giving it a northerly direction to the Ganges. The other vessels employed on the coast of Malabar, as Trappaga and Kotumba, it is not necessary to describe : they have still in the Eastern Ocean germs, trankees, dows, grabs, galivats, praams, junks, champans, &c. names which have all been adopted by the Europeans, and which it is no more requisite to distinguish, than to explain our own brigs, snows, schooners, sloops, or cutters, to the Hindoos.

I do not find the Tarnasari of Barthema in the modern maps : it might lie between Puleachat and Bengal.

The vessels here meant are the monoxy'Ia, built from the bottom without ribs, ill equipped with sails, and heavy sailers. In these vessels it was twenty days sail from the continent to Ceylon, but in others only seven : both distances are in excess, but they are palliated by Vossius, who supposes the distance to be measured from Covalam in Travancoor, to Pointe du Galle in Ceylon, as Pliny places the port of Ceylon on the south side of the island. Pliny has likewise a refer ence to Strabo, when he speaks of twenty days sail from the Prasii to Ceylon, in the paper-ship's of Egypt, and seven in the Greek vessels. Prasii is evidently a corrupt reading ; and how far paper-ships, or ships composed of the biblos, should venture on these voyages, is dubious. That they were used on the Nile is true : Radicibus papyri incolse pro ligno utuntur. Ex ipso quidem papyro navigia contexunt. (Plin. lib. xiii. 2. 8c v. 22. See Salmas. iiio.)

After passing these, the course turns again to the east, and sailing with the coast on the left, and the sea on the right, you arrive at the Ganges, and the extremity of the continent to wards the east, called Khruse [or the Golden Chersonese]. The Ganges is the largest river of India ; it has an annual increase and decrease, like (g) the Nile; and there is a mart on it of the same name, through which passes a considerable traffic, consisting of pearls, betel, the Gangetic (h) spikenard, and the Gansetic muslins, which are the finest manufacture of the sort.

But why the betel-leaf should be carried in this form from Arracan to China, in order to be made up with the Areka nut, and then returned to India by the Chinese under the denomination of Malabathrum, is difficult to comprehend. The distinction between the leaf and the nut seems to be preserved in petros and malabathrum ; for that petros is the betel, or betre, cannot well be doubted, when it is described as resembling the young leaves of the vine ; for the betel is a delicate species of the pepper-plant, and that plant is almost constantly described as similar to the vines. \u2014 The description of the Sesat\u00e6 leaves little room to doubt that they are Tartars ; and we have here, upon the whole, a description of that mode of traffic which has always been adopted by the Chinese, and by which they to this hour trade with Russia, Thibet, and Ava.

Cosmas (styled Indicopleustes, from the supposition that he had navigated the Indian Ocean) copied a Greek inscription at Adule, which has since appeared to relate to Ptolemy Euergetes, and to prove that he had nearly concfuered the whole empire of the Seleucid\u00e6 in Asia, and the kingdom of Abyssinia in Africa : two historical facts of considerable importance ; notwithstanding, his success in Asia was scarcely discovered in history \\ till this monument prompted the inquiry, and the conquest of Abyssinia still rests upon this evidence alone.

The work of Cosmas is styled Topographia Christiana, and is intended to prove that the eanh is a plane, in opposition to the philosophical notion of its being a sphere, which the author conceived to be an heretical opinion, contrary to the revelation of the scriptures. He had himself travelled much, and in the parts he visited, he still found they were all on a plane, as well as Greece; in consequence of this notion, his deductions are rather extraordinary; but the facts he relates, and the countries he describes, are given with all the characters of truth that simplicity can afford. There were* two copies of his work, one in the Vatican, sup posed to be of the ninth century, and another at Florence in the Library of Lorenzo6, attributed to the tenth. In 1632, Leo Allatius published the Adulitick Inscription from the copy in the Vatican 7 ; and this was republished by Berkelius in 1672, and again by Spon in 1685, both from the extract of Allatius.

Bruce assures us, that this history is confirmed by the Chro- nicle of Axuma, and Montfaucon cites Non- nosus in Photius, whose testimony corrobo- rates the chronicle in the amplest manner, (Montfaucon Nova Collectio Patrum, torn. ii. p. 140.) for Nonnosus speaks of himself as ambassador from Justin to Kaisus, an Arab prince of the Khindini and Maadeni, and to Elesbaas king of Axuma, agreeing so much both in time and name with the Elesbaas of Cosmas, that it induces a conjecture that Cosmas was a monk in the suite of the am- bassador (see Photius, p. 6. ed. Geneva, 1612, with the citation of Nicephorus in the margin). But without taking this into the consideration, it is a natural consequence, if Elesbaas is proved to be the king of Axuma in that age, that the account of Cosmas is worthy of credit. Bruce adds, -that Mahcmed in the Koran mentions Dunaanas [Dhu'lnowasl not by name, but as master of the fery pits, al- luding to the martyrs who were burnt (vol. i. j). 516.)

The expedition of Elesbaas is usually placed in 525, the eighth year of Justin, but the marble might have been copied a year or two years before the expedition. \" It is a most remarkable circumstance, that in a history so obscure and wild as that of Abyssinia, any fact should be established upon such clear and satisfactory grounds, as this of the reign of Elesbaas and his expedition into Arabia. But the authorities adduced by Baronius, Montfaucon, Ludolfus, Chishull, and Bruce are so express, that there cannot remain a doubt ; and if that reign is established, the veracity of Cosmas needs no other support. Now it appears from the evidence they have adduced, that the sovereigns of Abyssinia, in the reign of Justin, about the year 525, had extended their power into the country of the Homerites, which is a district of Sabea, where they had a governor residing ; it appears also that some Abyssinians had been put to death by Dunaanas, (one of the native chiefs in Arabia, and a Jew,) who are still considered as martyrs to their faith, and that Elesbaas un- dertook an expedition into Arabia, in which he was successful, aiid punished the assassin of his subjects.

The governor, whose name was Asbas\", applied to me and to a merchant of the name of Menas, to copy the inscription ; Menas was [a Greek of my acquaintance, who afterwards be came] a monk at Raithu15, and died there not long ago. \"We [undertook the business together, and having completed it,] delivered one copy to the governor, and kept another 'for our selves.

After that we copied what was written on the chair, which was connected with the inscription already given, and ran thus : After this, having with a strong hand compelled the tribes bordering upon my own kingdom to live in peace, I made38 war Tigris ; and that they were brought by this stream, now called the Suab or Soweib, into the Euphrates near Korna. From Korna they would be conveyed up the Euphrates to Thapsacus, or higher, and require no otheT land carnage but from that point to the bay of Issus. This would certainly be the best and least expensive conveyance from Susa to Egypt, and there could be no other water carriage unless by the Euleus to the Gulph of Persia, and so round the continent of Arabia into the Red Sea. If it could be proved from history, that the fleets of Euergetes had ever circumnavigated Arabia, w;e might ad mit this as the readiest mode of conveyance ; but I have searched history in vain to establish this conclusion. If it was contained in the point of the tablet broken, we have much reason to lament the loss ; for so persuaded am I of the authenticity of the inscription, that I should admit the fact without hesitation, if found there. I can only now add, that the canal from Susa to the Tigris, and the car riage thence up to Thapsacus, afford the most probable clue to this passage. 37 The inscription is here manifestly left imperfect, and that apparently on account of that part of the tablet which was mutilated. We are therefore at liberty to conjecture what these canals were, consistent with the nature of the countries alluded to. Chishull looks to the canals on the Euphrates ; but let us reflect, that the palace of Camby'ses was at Susa ; thither the spoils of Egypt were sent by the conqueror, and there they would be found by Euergetes, if they had not been removed by the Macedonians, or the kings of Syria. Much notice is taken in history of the treasures at Susa being plundered ; but the spoils of temples, Egyptian gods and statues had little to tempt the avarice of the con querors, and would have been moved to little purpose, at a great expence. It is highly probable, therefore, that Euergetes found them still at Susa ; and if we consider that Susiana was of all the provinces of the Persian empire, the one most furnished with, and most intersected by canals, we shall have no difficulty in concluding, that these cumbrous deities were embarked upon that canal which united the Euleus by the Mesercan with the 38 Mark the use of the first person.

Pliny's Gaza near Mosyilon is noticed by Chishull ; but these places in years all the notice o\"f this expedition should have sunk into silence, and that Agatharchides should say nothing of this plan, but so far as relates, to the elephants procured at Ptolemais Theron. Can this be adduced as an argu ment against the reality of the marble ? I think not ; and I trust it to its internal evidence. But if the authenticity of the marble be al lowed, what light does it not throw on the boasted discoveries of the Ptolemies ? It proves, that whatever might be the progress of Timosthenes down the coast of Africa sn the reign of Philadelphus, no commerce was established upon it in the reign of his son. It proves that the Greeks of Egypt did not yet trade beyond the straits,, or on the Mosyllitick coast, though they meditated the attempt. It proves that they did not yet go to Aden, but traded to Yemen within the straits ; and that one object of this expedition was to cLar the Arabian coast of pirates, from Leuke Kome to Sabea ; that is, from the top of the Gulph to the bottom. In the whole account not a word escapes that implies a trade with the marts of Arabia on the ocean Jjeyond the straits, nor does it afford any reason to bjlieve that the continent of Arabia was yet circumnavigated, or the dis coveries of the Ptolemies brought in contact with those of Alexander. This has been my inducement for intro ducing this marble to the knowledge of the reader, agreeably to my design of tracing the discoveries of the ancients step by step ; and I conclude this account with remarking, that commerce rather fell short than proceeded in the following reigns ; for it stopped at Sabea on the Arabian side, as it does in this marble, and on the African side it did not go so low in the regn of Philometor as in that of Euer getes. 52 Chronologers assign 26 years,tothe reign of Euergetes. Bur if a king commenced his reign in June, for instance, and died in October, it might be 26 years in a chren eje^ and yet the 27th v.-oijld have commenced. Chishull sun poses this to be the fact. Dodwe'l supposes Euergetes to have been clowned during his father's life time ; and we add, that an error (if it be .such) in numbers to be gaore readily imputed to a MS. tnaa made to impeach tbe marble. 4 A VOL. 1 I."], [596, "DISSERTATION I.

Impressed with the appearance of these difficulties, I venture on the following discussion with no common uncertainty; and little practised as I am in the science of correction, 1 decline the grammatical and critical part of the inquiry, and wish to con fine my reflections almost wholly to what is purely local and geographical. I. First then it is to be observed that our author has certainly not more than eight61 divisions of the heavens, or, as we should say in modern language, eight points of the compass, the same number as is marked upon the eight fronts of the Temple of the Winds at Athens, under the following appellations 6I ; 61 It is not intended to say that the whole eight occur in the Periplus, but that it has not more than eight. It uses A.parctias for the north, p. 17. and Dusis for the west. 62 See Aristotle Meteorol. lib. ii. c. 6. and de Mundo, c. 4."], [603, "ON THE TEXT. 553 In the application of these, or the terms equivalent to these, the Periplus is generally accurate, except in the instance of laying down the coast from Cape Elephas to Ardm&ta, where, if our charts are accurate, as they are, generally at least, it is impossible to apply the points of the Periplds to the actual state of the coast. II. Secondly, let us examine the points of the compass spe cified by the author in this passage, and his manner of express ing them ; these are lirdvai tS ly&og, or \\tP d.vu6i, and ttood duTyjv ttjv S'jtriv, answering to the south-west and wrest in the foregoing figure ; and here it is observed, that eirdm or \\iv dvu tS A&og, is not known as a Greek idiom, although tx bttxvoi is used by the author for the upper part of the coast, p. 12. But let us sup pose it to be a nautical phrase, how is it to be interpreted ? AfVicum versus a superiori parte ? Altius quam Africus? Above the south west ? If this has a meaning in Greek, what is to be understood by above? Is it more to the south or more to the west ? that is, is it south west by west, or south west by south? If we prefer the former, it corresponds with the bear ing of Zanguebar from Pemba, and nap,' xutvjv ryv Svtrw ; if we adopt the latter, it agrees best with the bearing of Zanguebar from Mombaca : and this seems the more proper, as the course is [<*<\u00a3>' Xj from Mombaca.

III. Thirdly, we must inquire how these expressions can be applied in any of their senses to the bearings of the islands and the coast; and here I assume Menuthesias or Menuthias for one of the Zanguebar islands, from the distance specified, which is. three hundred stadia from the coast, equal to thirty miles, and corresponding with the distance of no other islands in this part of the voyage. Now I have before assumed Mombaca for the termination of the Puralaari islands, that is, for the Kuivyj hdjgo%9 the new canal 66.

I had, in the former edition, expressed a predilection in fa vour of Monfia; but the inspection of Mr. /rrowsmith's07 map of Africa has convinced me, that this assumption is not tenable ; for he lays down Pemba far more easterly than Zanguebar, and Zanguebar itself as much more prominent aud conspicuous than either Pemba or Monfia: and that Menoothias was no ordinary island, appears from the description of it in the Periplus. All these islands lie east from the coast, which is sufficient to justify Dr. Charles Burney's reading of eyr dvxroX-yjv for l-rduu63 tv AiCog.

A better know ledge of all the three, if it should be hereafter obtained, may determine our choice : at present it is sufficient to observe, that the distance from the coast proves that it must be one of the Zanguebar islands ; and if so, the coast itself furnishes no proper site for a mart or settlement till we arrive at Quiloa."], [613, ""], [614, "lo front Dissertation!!!

I. Pomponius Mela, as earliest in point of time, requires our consideration first, and in this map it will be seen with what propriety the ancients called the extent of the earth, from west to east, length, and the extent, from north to south, breadth. Artemidorus1 (104, A. C.) is said by Pliny to have first employed the terms of length and breadth, or longitude and latitude. The dividing of these into degrees, and degrees into their parts, was not effected fully before the time of Ma rinus, nor brought into practice before Ptolemy. But our present inquiry is confined to the appearance of the earth, and here the great object which strikes our attention is the vast southern continent or hemisphere, placed as it were1 in coun terbalance to the northern. The form in which it here appears 1 See Agathemerus, in Hudson's Geog. Aristotle employs length and breadth. Min. cap. iv. Strabo, lib. i. p. 64. Ptol. ' Pom. Mela, lib. i. c. i.

It is this supposition which gives rise to the expressions of Manilius.

It is this supposition also which gave rise to the belief of cir cumnavigations which never took place; for M. Gossellin proves that the voyage of Eudoxus cuts through the centre of the great continent of Africa, and Hanno is carried to the Red Sea without passing the equator. This it is which extends the title of the Atlantick Ocean, to the east of Africa as well as to the wrest, and makes Juba commence the Atlantick from Mosyllon. All this is natural, if the continent of Africa be curtailed at the twelfth degree of northern latitude, and the voyage shortened by about eighty degrees in extent. 4 Abulfeda had the same notion.

Seneca thought this might be sailed in a few days, with a fair wind '* and Aristotle was of the same opinion. See Roger Bacon,. Op. Maj. p. 183. And Martin Behaim in the Norimberg Map. So also the Map in Gryn\u00e6us, Novus Orbis, where Cuba lies in the place of North America, and Japan 15 degrees to the west. But it may be proper to call the attention of the reader to the view of this sort of a world, as applicable to the Ph\u0153nician expedition of Herodotus. A vessel sailing along the southern coast of such an Africa as this, has in theory the sun upon the right-hand of the navigators for three parts of the voyage, and this constitutes the circumstance as the grand occurrence of the expedition. But were the same vessel to run into latitude 34\u00b0 south, the real latitude of the Cape, the space during which the sun would be on the right-hand, is a point in comparison of the other course, and the phenomenon would doubtless have been pointed out in other terms, as the quarter of the heavens, or the place of the luminary. There is another particular in this map also well worthy of attention, which is the source of the Nile placed in the southern4 hemisphere, and compelled to run under the ocean, 4 See Diodorus, lib. i. p. 45. k%o tS Vide insuper, p. 49.

This is a circumstance which is now known to take place on its passing through the Lake Tzana or Dembea, where Bruce assures us that the course of the stream across the lake is distinctly visible from the high land in the neigh bourhood. Nothing farther worthy of observation occurs in this map, but that it cuts short the peninsula of India as well as Africa, and places Taprobana or Ceylon as it appears in the tables of Ptolemy. It unites also the Caspian Sea with the ocean, and gives a circumambient ocean on the north, as navigable as on the south, part of which the Argonauts did navigate ! and all but the whole was supposed to have been navigated, by Pliny.

The Map of Cosmas8 Is so poor a composition, and so wholly the conception of his own mind, that it would be utterly unworthy of notice were it not the original production of the monk himself. The ve- racity of Cosmas, both in regard to what he saw and heard, is respectable, as has been shewn in his account of Cey- lon ; but his hypothesis, it is evident, makes the world a parallelogram with a circumambient ocean, and the rivers of Paradise flowing on the outside; while the vicissitude of day and night is not caused by the revolution of the earth or the heavens, but by the sun's disk being obscured by a mountain on the north 9.

I owe the knowledge of this map to the kindness of Dr. White the Arabick Professor at Oxford ; there are two Ara bick10 copies of Al-Edrissi in the Bodleian, and that from which the opposite map is taken is beautiful and adorned with maps for almost every chapter. This before us is a general one, curious because it is evidently founded upon the error of Pto lemy, which carries the coast of Africa round to the east, and forms a southern continent totally excluding the circumnaviga tion into the Atlantick Ocean. The learned Harlman sup poses that Ai-Edrissi's account goes as low as 26\u00b0 20' 0\" south, to the river Spirito Santo. It may be so, for Daguta is his last city, which is but three days sail from Gasta, and Gasta is but one from Komr, the Island of the Moon, or Madagascar, (See Hartman s Al-Edrissi, p. 113, et seqq.) This point and Wak Wak or Ouak Ouak seem to baffle explanation, and Hartman confesses he can find no room for the latter. But with all its fable, it is still the kingdom of the Zinguis, (Hartm. p. 100.) and if so, it must be Benomotapa, which lies inland, and which Al-Edrissi has ignorantly brought to the coast. It is, in short, the termination of knowledge, which, with Arabians as well as Greeks, is always fabulous, and is by some of their writers placed in the Mare tenebrosum, or circumambient ocean \", (p. 107.

Whether all these inconsistencies would have ap peared as gross in detail as in the general map, I cannot say ; my want of Oriental learning, I regretted, did not permit me to examine the MS. myself, in a satisfactory manner, and I had intruded too far on the assistance of the professor.

This, however, is of little weight in the subject of our inquiry ; for the same nation in Europe which we call Germans, are styled Almains by the French, and Teutsch 3, or Teudesch, by themselves. The Jesuits who were in China have, however, endeavoured to find an approach to this sound in Tan-djin, Han-djin, the people of Tan 4 or Han, two of their early dy nasties ; and in Chen-si, one of the principal provinces: but upon these similarities there is little dependance ; for it is generally allowed, that the principal native appellation is Tchou-koue5, the Central6 Kingdom; and every nation in the world, from vanity, from relation to all the regions around, or from ignorance, is entitled to the same distinction.

It is highly dubious whether this dynasty, whose name differs no more from Chin than Kirk from Church, was ever of celebrity sufficient to be known in India or Europe; but it is very pos- sible that the Japanese, who called the empire Cin in the age of Marco Polo ', derived the appellation from the Kin ; and in the language of Marco, Cin is Cheen. From this source, how- ever, the Macedonians could not have obtained the appellation of Thina : they were the first that brought this name to Europe ; and their Thina they must have received either from the Arabs or Indians, who style it Cheen or Ma-Cheen. Cosmas, who received his information from Ceylon, by means of his friend Sdpatrus, terms the nation Tzinist\u00e6 and Tzinitz\u00e6. This title approaches Chinese as nearly as it can be expressed in Greek letters. The same sound of the word was heard by the Portu guese, upon their arrival in India ; and from them Cheena, or China, has descended to all the nations of Europe. Cheen, therefore, by all these several navigators, was ob tained as they advanced towards the East ; and the first country that bears the resemblance of the sound is Cochinchina, called by the natives, and by the Chinese, Kao-tchii-chin9; by the Jesuits, Tchen-tchen ; and by the Arabs, Cheen ; the Sinia Sinarum of Al Edrissi.

It is impossible to prove that these appellations are as ancient as the era of Alexander, because history is silent ; but the ac quisition of the same sound by all the nations which advanced by sea from the West towards the East, from the time of Alex ander to the date of the Portuguese discoveries, is a strong pre sumption ib its favour. The first mention of Thina by the Greeks, is in the Treatise of Aristotle\" de Mundo (if that work be his) ; but the full no tice of it is by Eratosthenes, and as Eratosthenes lived under the second Ptolemy, his mention of Thina is early enough to suppose, that the Greeks had no knowledge of so distant a region before Alexander, and knew it then only in consequence of his expedition. Though the Macedonians proceeded no farther east than the Indus, they certainly acquired a knowledge of the Ganges and Ceylon : this we learn from history ; and if the,ir inquiries went farther, they had Persians, Indians, and Arabians, in their army, from whose report they might gratify their curiosity. If Aristotle, therefore, had heard of Thina, this must be the source of his knowledge ; or if the Treatise imputed to him be not his, the knowledge of Eratosthenes must have been acquired, either from the same source, or from those who sailed on board the fleets from Egypt, and met the Arabian, Indian, or Persian merchants in the ports of Sabea. \" Aristotle died A.

A report, coming through no less than five11 intermediate channels, like this, would doubtless be loaded with much error, fable, and inconsistency ; but that by some method or other it did come, is undeniable; for the map of Eratosthenes is re corded by Strabo.

II. SIN\u00c6 OF PTOLEMY IN\" SIAM, SIN\u00c6 OF OTHER AUTHORS, AND SERES THE SAME ; PERIPLUS, ERATOSTHENES, MELA, D'ANVILLE. The Thina of Eratosthenes, however, is not to be confounded with the Thin\u00e6 or Since of Ptolemy ; for these, whether we place them, with d'Anville, in Cochin-china, or with Vossius and Gossellin, in Siam, are in a vevy different latitude and position. Their country does not face14 to the east, but to the west; and their latitude is not 56\u00b0 north, but 2\u00b0 20' south'5. But the Thina of Eratosthenes and Strabo, is the Thina and \u00bbSin\u00e6 of the Periplus, of which we have a certain proof; be cause the author says, that silk is the produce of their country. This country, therefore, is the Serica of Ptolemy ; and in this sense, the Sin\u00e6 and the Seres are the same, that is, they are both Chinese. \u2014 We must now advert to the gross error of the Periplus, which places Thina, the capital of the Sin\u00e6, under \u2022* D'Anville, by placing them in Cochin, to maintain), as well as Gossellin. china, makes them face to the east ; but in 1S This is very well argued by Gossellin this he opposes Mercator (who had no system Geog. des Grecs, p. 143."], [635, "ON THE SERES. 579 the constellation ,s of the Lesser Bear ; that is, in the age to which we refer it, within twelve degrees of the Pole; a climate which, so far from producing the silk- worm, must be unin habitable by man. How this error arose, can be explained only by conjecture; but it appears to originate from one of two causes, which are perfectly different and distinct : for, first, we find the ancient geographers very observant'7 of the disappear ance of the north Polar Star, as we advance to the south, and equally attentive to its re-appearance as we approach again to the north ; it might happen, therefore, that the navigators who went to China, might have observed the loss of the Polar Star in the Straits of Malacca, and the recovery of it as they ap proached the coast of China ; and this observation, conveyed through a multiplicity of reporters, may have caused the con fusion between a latitude which lay under the Lesser Bear, and a latitude where the Polar Star became visible. But if this cause should be thought too scientific to have given rise to so gross an error, there is a second, much more probable and natural ; which is, that if we suppose a delinea tion of the habitable world, formed upon the principle of that which I obtained from Al Edrissi lS in the former part of this work, or like the Borgian '\u00bb Table in Sir Joseph Banks's pos session, the degrees of longitude diminish so hastily as we ap- 16 Gossellin notices the approach of this star to the Pole.

D'Anville had M certainly no pre-disposition in favour of this opinion ; for in passing through Scythia towards the Seres, he ar rives at the country of the Eighurs from five to ten degrees west of China ; and in that province he finds a tree which produces a fruit like the cocoon of the silk-worm.

Scythia, according to Pliny, commences at the issue of the Caspian Sea into the Northern Ocean, and extends all round the continent, fronting north and north-east\", till it comes to Tabis, which divides it from the Seres; and what is meant by Taurus may be discovered in Strabo, who informs us, that Eratosthenes prolonged 34 Taurus from the Bay of Issus in the Mediterranean, across the whole continent of Asia, dividing it by the same parallel 3S of latitude, till it terminated on the Eastern Ocean, that is, the Sea of China. At the termination was Thina, on the same parallel as Rhodes, which is 36\u00b0 north; and this parallel, if we suppose it to be correct, would embrace all the northern part of China, be tween latitude36 36\u00b0 and 40\u00b0; in which case, we fix the southern limit at the promontory of Taurus, in 3f>, and the northern at Tabis somewhere about 40\u00b0.

On ac count of that error, I do not insist upon this ; but, upon the whole, the SeTes of Ptolemy coincide with the SeTes of M< la, Pliny, and Dionysius; and his latitude of the capital advancing so nearly to the parallel of Pekin, is one of the most illustrious approximations to truth that ancient geography affords. Without affecting precision, we have now a position for the Seres in the northern provinces of Ctiina; and this deduction, as it is founded on the information of the ancients, is not much controverted by the moderns. But we have another character istic of the Seres, derived from the produce of their country, which is silk: this beautiful fabric we know, from the Chinese themselves, was the original manufacture of their country \u2014 - specifically their own, by the prerogative of invention; and though communicated to other countries in their neighbourhood, and from the first mention of it, procurable in the ports of the Golden Chersonese, at the Ganges, and on the coasts of Coro mandel and Malabar, still was it so exclusively and pre-emi nently the attribute of China, that the Sin\u00e6 were, from this very circumstance, denominated Seres, or Silk-worms, by the Greeks.

Hither it must have been brought in that age, either by the trade which passed between Patala and Malabar, or by the caravans through Scythia, on the north; for that in so early an age it was manu factured in India can hardly be admitted, when we observe that the author of the Periplus, four hundred years later, mentions it in Malabar, not as a native production or manufacture, but as an article brought thither from countries farther43 to the east.

The pre-eminence in this respect is still due to the same country ; for notwithstanding that almost all the nations of the East, and many in Europe, now breed the insect and weave the fabric, China is still the Country of Silk ; the greatest quantity is still produced there, and of the best quality : it is the general clothing of the nation, and its superabundance still allows of a vast exportation to all the countries of the East, and to Europe itself. In the course of this investigation, then, we have learnt from ancient authorities, that the Seres are the Thin\u00e6 of Era tosthenes \u2014 the Sin\u00e6 of the Periplus; that their country lies between Tartary, on the north, and India extra Gangem, on the south; that it is the remotest region 4S towards the east; that it is bounded on its eastern front by the ocean ; that the ocean extends (in their opinion), without interruption, on the same parallel to the coast of Spain ; and that silk was brought from this country, where it was originally found, to India, and out of India, by the Red Sea, into Egypt, and from thence to Europe.

But this is a fact actually preserved by Ptolemy ; for he informs us from Marinus, that Maes, a Macedonian00, whose Roman name was Titianus, did not indeed perform61 the journe}T himself, but that he sent his agentis through the whole extent of this extraordinary pere grination. c- In what state the Tartar nations then were, which could ad mit of such a traffic through all these different regions, it is now extremely difficult to determine ; for though caravans have passed within these few years between China and Russia, and though there was a communication61, and perhaps still is, be tween that empire and Samarkand, as also with the Usbecks this was carried on by the natives of the respective countries, and afforded no passage63 for merchants to pass throughout from one extremity of Asia to the other. * Lib. i. c. ir. 61 Michael Ostaliof, a Russian merchant, had travelled from Archangel to China, winter and summer, for 14 years.

There was a period indeed, during the time of Zingis and his immediate successors, when the power of the Mongoux ex- tended from the Sea of Amour to Poland and the Euxine ; and when there was a regular intercourse, by established posts, throughout this vast extent. By means of this, Marco Polo, his uncle, and his father, Rubruquis64, Carpin, and others, actually reached the court of Cambalu, and returned again by passports from the emperor. It was Marco Polo, the first of modern travellers who brought to Europe any consistent account of this vast empire \u2014 who entered China by the north, and re- turned by sea to Bengal. His route outwards is not easy to trace, because bis descriptions diverge both to the right and to the left ; but it is highly probable that he entered China nearly by the same route65 as Goez did, from Kashghar: this would have brought him to Sochieu, or some other town in the neighbourhood, to reach which he might not have passed the Great Wall. But if this would account for his not mentioning it in the first instance, it does not solve the difficulty ; for the court of Coblai, like that of Kien-long the late emperor, was a Tartar court, frequently kept in Tartary as well as China; \"'' Rubruquis, in 1254, found in Tartary, at Caracoram, a Frenchman bom at Paris, Wm.

He did not bring the name of China to Europe, but Cathai and Mangi onty, because he obtained those appellations alone which were in use among the Tartars ; and it was several centuries later, before it was known that Cathai and China were the same. We are contending here only for the existence of the communication, and endeavouring to shew, that in the middle ages it was the same, or similar to that of the ancients. But from the time when the empire of the Tartars broke into separate governments, no travellers or mer chants from Europe dared to attempt the dangers and exac tions which must have attended them at every step, and when the progress of Mahomedism, in these northern courts, brought on an additional suspicion and hostility against every Christian who should have entered their country.

Ap ply this to Lord Macartney's embassy, and it proves why the ambassador was compelled to depart at a given day, and why his presents were inscribed with the name of Tribute. 70 In all which I believe it is unique. The same circumstances are repeated by Josafa Barbaro (in Ramusio, torn. ii. f. 106. ), which he received from a Tartar on the Don, who had passed from Samarkand to China, which was the course of the northern caravans in that age, 1450 ; and silks, though then made in Persia, fromed the principal article of the trade.

Throughout the whole, the courage, perseverance, address, and patience of Goez, place him in the highest rank of travellers : he was deserted by all his companions but an Armenian boy, of the name of Isaac ; and Isaac was so fortunate as to reach Pekin, from whence he was sent to Macao, where he obtained a passage to the Portuguese settlements in Malabar.

VIII. ROUTE OF THE SESAT\u00c6 FROM ARRACAN TO CHINA. Let us next examine the ancient accounts, in regard to this and other routes of the same sort. The first author that speci fies this intercourse by land is Mela77: he says, the Seres are a nation celebrated for their justice, and have become known to us bjr their commerce ; for they leave their merchandize in the desert73, and then retire, till the merchants they deal with have left a price or barter for the amount, which, upon their de parture, the Seres return and take. This assertion is repeated also by Pliny, and confirmed by the PeriplCis7''; for that the Sesat\u00e6 of that journal arc the Tartar tribes which trade with China, cannot be doubted : the extravagances recorded of ,s If we may judge by the mountains at tributed to both. Timour had always a body of Batlacshans in his army, for the purpose of passing straits, climbing mountains, &_c. ac cording to Cherif Eddin.

Paris, i63i) has recorded the same cha racter of the Seres, and the same mode of con ducting their commerce with foreigners ; but with the addition of a curious particular : that silk had formerly been confined to the great and rich, but in his time was within the pur chase ~bf the common people (nunc etiam ad usum insimorum sine ul'a discretione profi ciens). This circumstance proves, not only the great extension of commerce at Constan tinople within thirty years after its founda tion, by which the material w^s obtained, but likewise ,the proficiency of the manufacturers at Tyre and Bery'tus] in preparing it for the market. The whole passage is worth consulting. 4g 2"], [652, "595 DISSERTATION I. [Part II. them, and the articles80 mentioned, throw a shade of obscurity over this transaction ; but that a fair 8l or mart is held for several days, and that the goods are left to the faith of those they deal with, is evident ; and that this is a characteristic 82 of the Chinese trade, from the age of Mela to the establishment of Kiachta, is the uniform testimony of all that mention the commerce. Now that the Sesat\u00e6 are a Tartar tribe cannot be questioned, when we find them described in the Peripltis; for they are a race of men squat and thick set, flat nosed, and broad faced. They travel with their wives and families, and convey their mer chandize enveloped in sacks or mats83. These are manifestly 80 The malabathrum is attributed to the Sesatai by the Periplus ; and though it is much more natural that the Tartars should obtain betel from the Chinese, than the con trary (and so Vossius renders it), yet that the Sesatai and Besadai are the same, cannot be doubted.

Now the Kirrhadii of Ptolemy are at the eastern mouth of the Ganges, and there the betel grows, and is procurable ; and if the Besadai were seated on the north of that country, they would be in Lassa or Thi bet, both of which are Tartar countries, and might well be engaged in conducting this traffic between China and Bengal, or perhaps Arracan. But whatever obscurity there may be in this, it appears evident that Ptolemy and the Periplus mean the same people ; and, by the similarity of expression, copied from the same authority. It ought likewise to be ob served, that Z^coi e\u00bb.; te'Xo;, as it now stands in the Periplus, is a reading of Vossius for evvem, or Ev/uoi, or something unintelligible in the first copy of the Periplus. Upon the whole, there- fore, if we interpret the Periplus by Ptolemy, and conclude that the Sesatai brought the betel from Bengal or Arracan, making them the same people as the Besadai, we have a consistent account of this article reaching the northern provinces of China, as it reached the southern by sea. That the betel is procurable in Arracan, is certain ; for it grows abundantly in Ava. Symes's Embassy, p. 255. See also Dr. Buchanan's Account of the Burmas, 'As. Researches, vol. v. p. 219.

Here, therefore, we may discover another line of intercourse between India and China, which passed the mountains of Thibet85, and joined the route which came from Cabul and Balk, or reached the southern provinces of that great empire by a shorter course ; and this, perhaps, may explain a dubious86 passage of the Periplt\\s already noticed, and may instruct us how the silk of China came down the Ganges, or the Brama87 putra into Bengal, and from thence passed by sea to the coasts of Coromandel and Malabar.

INTERCOURSE BY SEA MELA, RAJAH OF PLINY, COSMAS INDICOPLEUSTES. I have dwelt more particularly on the silk of China, because it is as essentially the distinguished produce of that country, as the pepper of Malabar, the muslins of Guzerat, the myrrh and' frankincense of Arabia, are characteristics of these several countries ; and I am very anxious to prove the communication with China by land, because it will presently appear that there was another line of intercourse by sea. If, therefore, the access both ways can be established, China alone, whether denomi nated Thina, Sin\u00e6, or Seres, must be the country intended;. for no other can be approached by these two different ways and these two, opened from the earliest accounts we have, in. history down to the present day, denote exclusively the appro priate character of that vast empire, as these circumstances can be applicable to no other. The establishment of this truth will afford a'ready solution of the difficulty which arises from the position of the Sin\u00e6 in Ptolemy : they cannot be in China ; and if we accede to the opinion of M. Gossellin, that they are in* Siam, we must conclude that Ptolemy, who gives so imperfect an account of the voyage to Cattigara, knew nothing of a farther intercourse by sea with the Seres, and that it was un known in his age.

The accuracy of geography we are not concerned with here, but the assertion; and what is meant may be seen by consulting M. Gossellin's93 Map of Eratosthenes. But this evidence is dubious and obscure, and conduces no- thing to the proof of any voyage performed. Little more satis faction shall we receive from Pliny or the Periplus ; for the father of the Rajah, who came upon the embassy from Ceylon to Rome in the reign of Claudius, did not reach the SeTes by sea, but passed from India over the mountain Emodus, the Him malu of the Hindoos, and thence by an eastern route arrived at the country of Seres, with whom he traded under the same restrictions as the merchants from Persia and Europe, or the Sesat\u00e6 mentioned by the Periplus. Cosmas, as far as I can discover, is the first author that frilly asserts the intercourse by sea between India and China; for he mentions that the Tzinist\u00e6 brought to Ceylon silk, aloes, cloves, and sandal-wood. The articles themselves are the specific ex ports of China still ; and that the Tzinist\u00e6 '4 are Chinese, can not be questioned ; for he expressly mentions their country, not merely as exporting, but producing silk; and specifies the distance from it by land as much shorter, compared with the voyage by sea. This circumstance can accord with no other country, at the extremity of the east, but China ; for no other 85 In Melam, lib. iii. c. 7. the temples in Ava, Pegu, and Siam.

This is the one point, above all others, which I have laboured to establish by this disquisi tion; and though I obtain not my proof till the sixth century96, the evidence is consistent in all its parts, and complete. The inference is justifiable, that the same intercourse existed by sea, as well as by land, in ages much earlier, though the account had not reached Europe, and though the proof is defective. It is in vain that I have searched for any intelligence of this sort previous to Ptolemy, though I was very desirous to find it, and prepossessed in favour of its existence. But Ptolemy g? fully asserts that he had received his information, relative to the Golden Chersonese and Cattigara, from those Avho had long frequented those countries ; from merchants who traded thither, or who came from thence. It is to be lamented that he stops at this point, for those who had long frequented Cattigara, we should reasonably conclude, must have heard of China, or seen Chinese ships in that port.

But he acquaints us candidly himself, that though- Marinus08 had heard of the journey performed by the agents of Maes through Scythia to the Seres, he had no account of any one who had made the voyage by sea from the Golden Chersonese to Cattigara : all that he knew therefore, even of Cattigara, was from report; and much less could he know of all that was beyond it, that is, \u00bb\u25a0 TS Se a-irl rH& Xjuo-\u00ab; XEfpWVa IttI tos KaTTtya\u00bbet.Si\u00ab7r>.s tov raSt*o>u}ii o Mafim; s\u00ab IxT&enu.

Still it is extraordinary, however the information of Marinus should be deficient, that Ptolemy had obtained no farther intelligence from the merchants of whom he inquired. The first view of his map would naturally suggest the idea which M. d'Anville has embraced : it looks like the termination of the peninsula of Malacca, and rises up again northward to his Sinus Magnus, as if we were entering the bay of Siam99, the sea of Cochin-china, and China. But when we observe his Sin\u00e6 placed on the same parallel with Malacca, and his Catti gara carried down eight degrees IM to the south, we see at once that both must be placed on a coast that has no existence, ex cept in that vast imaginary continent which he has brought round the whole Southern Ocean, from Africa, in longitude 80\u00b0, to Cattigara, in 180*. It is this circumstance which compels us, notwithstanding the appearance of his map, to coincide with the opinion of Vossius and M.

Ptolemy's position of this island is of no importance; for he has hardly one island correctly placed from Africa to Siam, and his ignorance of its extent is no more extraordinary than his augmentation of Cey lon.

The placing of this likewise in the neighbourhood of the Pirates, which has been the character of the Malays in all ages, contributes to the same supposition. I do not mention these circumstances for the purpose of invali dating M. Gossellin's system, for upon the whole I accede to it; but still the question is not cleared of all its difficulties; and it seems highly probable, that as Marinus had no evidence from any one who had performed the voyage either to the Golden Chersonese or Cattigara, that Ptolemy had no informa tion which was consistent to direct him. That the voyage itself was performed by native merchants may nevertheless be admitted, not only as it may be collected from the accounts of later ages, but as it is asserted by Cosmas.

It is the most distant country east, according to Dionysius\"3 and the Periplits : it is called an island by both ; an island of the ocean, by the latter, and placed adjoining to the eastern mouth of the Ganges.

If Tamos\"4 be the Tamala of Ptolemy, that cape must be either in Ava or Pegu, as we adopt the system of d'Anville or Gos sellin; and if it must be an island\"5, we might place it at the mouth of the Ava river, which passes through Pegu to the sea, and forms many islands at its different mouths. Here also Gossellin fixes his Golden Chersonese, and the river Chrysoana; but Ptolemy has two provinces \u2014 one of gold, and one of silver \u2014 \u2022 before he arrives at the Chersonese; and if his Kirrhadia be Arracan, these provinces must be on the western coast of Ava, above the Golden Chersonese of bis arrangement.

The glory of Pegu and Siam has sunk under the ascendant of Ava ; but in all these courts, the exhibition of gold llS in their temples, public buildings, gallies, habits, and decorations of every kind was, while they existed, the summit of Oriental pomp, as it continues in Ava \"7 to the present time ; and if we should chuse to carry the Silver Metropolis of Iaba dioo\"3 to Sumatra, the splendour of Acheen, in its better days, would bear its proportion to the gold of Ava.

XI. LONGITUDES AND LATITUDES OF PTOLEMY, HOWEVER IN EXCESS, STILL THE CAUSE OF MODERN DIS- COVERY; NAVIGATION TOWARDS THE WEST FROM SPAIN ROGER BACON, COLUMBUS, MAP OF PTOLEMY\"; EULOGY OF PTOLEMY. In the whole of the attempt in which I have been engaged, from the voyage of Nearchus to the close of the present work, it has been my endeavour to trace the progress of discovery, as carried on by the Greeks and Romans, from the time of Alex ander to the date of the Portuguese discoveries ; and the only object of consideration remaining is, the extent of their know ledge in Longitude and Latitude. The excess of longitude in Ptolemy is the subject of universal complaint ; but this excess arises, in the first instance, from his assumption of five hun dred stadia for a degree of a great circle ; and secondly, from the vague method of calculating distances, by the estimate of travellers and merchants, and the number of days employed in their journies by land, or voyages by sea. Respecting this last 7"], [669, "ON THE SERES. 613 source of error, Ptolemy was upon his guard ; for he repeatedly corrects the excess resulting from the calculation of days by Marinus, and reduces it sometimes a third, and some times* an half, or even more. After all, however, we have an hundred * and eighty degrees from the Fortunate Islands to Cattigara, upon a space that in reality occupies less than an hundred and twenty. So that the ancients, instead of knowing one-half of the globe which we inhabit, in fact knew only one-third : still they knew that the earth was a globe ; and one cause of their error, among others, perhaps was, that they had a desire to cover as much of it as they could- The error in latitude X on the contrary, was so small, that in a view of this kind it is not worth regarding ; for if we take it from the parallel through Thule to the parallel through the Cin namon Country, at eighty degrees, the difference from the truth is not more than six or seven degrees upon the whole, and with this we have little concern. But upon the excess of longitude depended, ultimately per haps, the grand problem of circumnavigating the globe, and the origin of modern discovery ; for as Strabo\"0 had said, that nothing obstructed the passage from Spain to India by a westerly course, but the immensity of the Atlantic Ocean ; and as all the early navigators of Portugal had some acquaintance \\ \\ sr \\) * irt^i rriv \\idtxnv. \" The parts about the Pillars of Hercules '\"> The latitude of Thule is 640 north, in Ptolemy, and the parallel' through the Cinna mon Country 1 6\u00b0 24' south ; that is, 8o\u00b0 24' upon the whole. \" join to those about India.\" Aristotle has also preserved the opinion of the Pythagoreans,. who made the Sun the centre of our system, with the Earth and the other planets revolving round it, which is the hypothesis adopted by Copernicus and established by Newton. \u00ab\" AristoUe seems the author of this suppo sition, as well as of most other things that are extraordinary in the knowledge of the ancients.

The whole of this depends on the spherical figure of the earth, a truth said to be deduced from the Egyptians, and received by Anaxagoras, Thales, Aristotle, Strabo \"\\ and the philosophers in general. From the same origin, possibly, Moses, who was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, was not ignorant of this great truth ; and certainly the author of the Book of Job bad learnt that the earth was hung \" upon nothing ;\" that is, if he did not know the power of gravitation, he at least knew the effect.

This part of the question, however, is not our immediate concern ; but to Ptolemy, respectable even in his errors, weowe the doctrine of the sphere, and the proper application of longitude and latitude.

Tyre, in fact, enjoyed this commerce almost exclusively, ex cept during the reign of Solomon, when Hiram found it his interest to unite with that monarch, who was sovereign of Idumea, in. order to secure a port for his fleets in the Red Sea; and the certain means of conveying the imports and exports over-land, from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. Solomon }, however, though he exacted a tax upon spices, and contribu tions from the kings and governors of Arabia, and shared in the profits of the trade, still had no fleets on the Mediterranean \u2014 no commerce on that sea. This circumstance gave Tyre a monopoly in regard to the whole communication with the Western World ; for though Egypt and Syria might receive the same articles from the East, we read of no fleets or commerce from these countries towards the West, in the hands of their respective inhabitants. The immense profits of this monopoly admit of calculation, if we dare trust to he Hebrew numbers in scripture ; but Dr. Kennicott has shewn, that in some instances the amount ex pressed by these has doubtless been exaggerated ; 'and if the numeration by letters was used in the original transcripts of the sacred writings, it is well known that numcrary letters are i Kings, x. 15,"], [677, "ON EZEKIEL, c. xxvn. 621 more subject to error, corruption, or exaggeration, in the manuscripts of all languages, than any other part of their text. But let us suppose that the advantages of Hiram were equal to those of Solomon, which is not unreasonable if we consider, that though Solomon enjoyed the profits of the transit, Hiram had the whole emolument of the commerce with the West. Let us then observe that the revenue of Solomon is stated at six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, which, according to Arbuthnot, amount to three millions six hundred and forty-six thousand three hundred and fifty pounds sterling\u2014 an extrava- gant sum at first sight ! but not impossible, if we compare it with the revenues of Egypt, which, after the building of Alexandria, enjoyed the same commerce, and the same mono- poly. Even at the present day, when the grand source of Egyptian wealth is obstructed by the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, Sir Home Popham estimates the revenue at twenty4 millions of dollars s, equal to between four and five millions English ; and when the same revenue, under the Roman government, may be estimated at three millions, which, allowing for the different ratio of specie, m'ay be taken at four times that amount. Let us reflect on these extraordinary sums, before we conclude upon the impossibility of the same com merce, and the same monopoly, producing a revenue of three millions and an half to Solomon, upon the import and transit; and the same sum to Hiram, upon the export. I dare not assert these to be facts, because I think, with Dr. Kennicott, \u00ab Of all this revenue, notwithstanding the Grand Seignor styles himself master of Egypt, scarcely a shilling reaches Constantinople. 5 Sir Home Popham's concise Statement o\u00a3 Facts, p. 154."], [678, "622 DISSERTATION II. [Part II. that numerary letters are liable to error ; but the revenue of Solomon is twice6 stated at the same sum ; and the contempla tion of the Egyptian revenue in the same situation, and under similar circumstances, admits of imputing an immense emolu ment to this commerce, wherever it became a monopoly. I have been led into this discussion, upon which every one must form his own judgment, by the specific detail of the Tyrian commerce, in the twenty-seventh chapter of Ezekiel, which, if we consider it only as historical, without any re ference to the divine authority of the Prophet, is not only the most early, but the most authentic record extant, relative to the commerce of the ancients ; as such, it forms a part of the plan which I have undertaken to execute. In this view I sub mit it to the reader ; and though I pretend not to the power of throwing new light on the subject, and despair of removing those difficulties which surpassed even the learning of a Bochart fully to elucidate, still there will not remain any general ob scurity which will prevent us from forming a right judgment upon the whole. Tyre ' was one of those states which had rejoiced at the destruction of Jerusalem, and the captivity of Judah ; it became an object of prophecy therefore to declare, that she also was to fall by the hands of the same conqueror, who had subverted the throne of David ; but so much more abundant were the means, or so much stouter was the defence of this commercial city, that the army of Nebuchadnezzar lay before it thirteen years.

Prideaux supposes this city to be the Old Tyre on the continent ; and that the inhabitants took refuge on the island, where the new city flourished again with almost the same vigour as its parent, till it was destroyed by Alexander in the year 332 A. C. two hundred and forty-one years after the reduction of it by the Babylonians. But, by the language of Ezekiel, it seems as if the city was upon the island in 573 ; for (in chap, xxvii. 3.) he says, Thou that art at the entry \u00bb of the sea ; and in the following verse, and in c. xxviii. the expression is, \" I sit in the midst of the seas,\" or, as it is in the original, \" in the heart of the seas.\" The question is not of great im- portance ; but as it rose again after its first reduction, by means of its situation, and the operation of the same causes, those causes ceased after its second fall, by the removal of Oriental commerce to Alexandria; and from that period it gradually declined, till it has become a village under the desolating government of the Turks; where Bruce'0 informs us, that he saw the prophecy of Ezekiel literally fulfilled\"; for when he was there, the fishermen were \" drying their nets upon the \" rocks.\" 8 Prideaux, vol. i. p. 72. \u00bb At the entering in of the sea.

In undertaking the elucidation of this chapter, perspicuity is the only object in view ; omitting, therefore, all consideration of the sublimity of prophecy, or the majesty of language, I propose, first, to illustrate the commerce of Tyre in its various branches, by reducing the Hebrew appellations to the standard of modern geography; and, secondly, to give a commentary on the whole, deduced from the best writers on the subject. By this method, due regard will be had to the convenience of one class of readers, and the curiosity of another; and although I pretend not to assign every ancient name, with precision, to its modern representative, still there will remain such a degree of certainty upon the whole as to gratify all that have a pleasure in researches of this nature. Let us then, in conformity to the opening of the prophecy, consider Tyre as a city of great splendour, magnificently built, and inhabited by merchants whose wealth rivalled the opulence of kings \u2014 who traded to the East by the intervention of Arabia, and to the West by means of the Mediterranean ; let us add to this, that in ages prior to the celebrity of Greece and Rome, their fleets had braved the dangers of the ocean, and their people were the only mariners who were not limited within the circle of the Mediterranean ; that they penetrated eastward through the Straits of Death\", which were the termination of the Red Sea, and westward beyond the Pillars of Hercules, which were the boundaries of all knowledge to every nation but *\" The Straits of Bab-el-mandeb, literally the Gate of Death."], [681, "ON EZEKIEL, e. xxvn. 625 their own ; that they advanced northward to the British Isles, and southward to the coast of Africa on the Atlantic Ocean u.

After this general view of the splendour of the city, we may proceed to the particulars specified in the Prophecy. First, therefore, Tyre procured, Verse 5.

From Tarshish the ships came that rejoiced in the market of Tyre, they replenished the city, and made it glo rious in the midst of the sea; and if we could now satisfy ourselves, with Gossellin, that Tarshish means only the sea in general, these ships might be either those which traded in the Mediterranean, or those which came up the Red Sea to Elath, or Leuke Kome, or any other port of Arabia. I am rather inclined to the latter, because, from the nineteenth to the twenty fourth verse, every particular relates to the East, and apparently to the produce of India; but if we are to understand, literally, the joy of the ships in the harbour of Tyre, they must be those of the Mediterranean; and this supposition accords best with the Tarshish noticed in the twelfth verse, which, by the mention of silver, lead, and tin; evidently alludes to Spain, and perhaps to the British Isles. Such is the historical part of this singular chapter relative to the commerce of Tyre, and illustrative of all ancient commerce whatsoever. It is uttered, however, in an age when the Tyrian fleets no longer sailed from Eziongeber, and when the com modities of the east were received by caravans from Arabia Petrea, Sabea, and Mesopotamia.

From this period I6, and probably from the termination of Solomon's reign, the Tyrians had no ships on the Red Sea, and supported their communica tion with it by land only ; their track varying as the power of the neighbouring countries fluctuated.

Tarshish was a merchant in the multitude of all kind of riches, and traded in silver, iron, tin, and lead ; the mention of tin naturally suggests the idea of Britain, and that the Tyrians did come to Britain, is asserted by the general testimony of the ancients ; but what Tarshish is, remains to be determined after all that has been written by every author that has touched upon the subject. Bochart has no doubt of its being Tartessus 2S in Spain, near the Straits of Gibraltar, and the articles of silver and lead might doubtless be procured in that country ; but whether tin could be collected there as a general cargo is highly V. The modern Carthage, as the French call England, is said to be raising at this time a body of Africans for service in the West In- dies. The omen is not auspicious, and the design is probably abandoned. '28Xamy objects to this very justly, that Tarshish is mentioned as a precious stone by Moses, before Tartessus could be in existence. He thinks Tarshish signifies gold, or a stone the colour of gold, the chrysolite or topaz ; and that the voyage of Tarshish had a reference to this, as gold and precious stones were the produce of it. See Introd. al'Ecriture, cap. iv. p. 425. 4 M 2"], [692, "DISSERTATION II. 636 [Part II. dubious ; for though Dioddrus mentions that tin was found in Spain, the bulk of that metal was only obtainable in Britain ; and as it is universally confessed that the Tyrians visited Britain, they might rather have gone thither to purchase it at first hand, than buy it in Spain, where it must have been enhanced by the expence of importation, and the prosit of intermediate mer chants. Be this however as it may, it is evident by the articles mentioned, that this was a western voyage, and so far whether to Spain or Britain is immaterial, for the great difficulty is, that Tarshish in scripture as clearly applies to an eastern voyage down the Red Sea, as to a western one towards Spain ; this appears in the voyage mentioned in the first of Kings (x. 22.) \" Solomon had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of \" Hiram.\" This was in the Red Sea, and brought a very dif ferent cargo \u2014 gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks, (2 Chron. ix. 21.) and (again xx. 36'.) Jehosaphat joined with Ahaziah to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made ships in Eziongeber ; so likewise, (1 Kings, xxii. 48.) Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold ; and as the whole of this, by the mention of Eziongeber, directs us east to the Red Sea ; so does the flight of Jonah as evidently direct us to a voyage west, on the Mediterranean, for the Prophet takes shipping at Joppa in order to flee to Tarshish. For the purpose of reconciling these two opposite ideas, M. Gossellin supposes, that Tarshish means the sea in general, and he likewise supposes two voyages eastward, one to Ophir in Hadramaut, and another to Tarshish, which he states as no distinct place ; but that the expression intimates a coasting voyage down the African side of the Red Sea, in which they"], [693, "ON EZEKIEL, c. xxvn. 637 touched at several different ports, and were delayed by the change of the monsoon. The former part of this hypothesis, that Tarshish signifies the sea in general, I wish to adopt ; and there is little to contradict this opinion, except the verse itself now under consideration ; but in regard to two eastern zg voyages, one to Ophir, and another down the western side of the Red Sea at large, I have great doubts ; I shall, therefore, first col lect the suffrages of the interpreters, and then compare the principal texts of scripture concerned; after this, if the diffi culty is still incapable of solution, no blame will attach to a failure which is common to so many writers of erudition and discernment. Tarshish is rendered Carthage in the vulgate ; but the ob jection to this is, that though tin and lead might be purchased in Carthage, as platina and tutanegmay be obtained in London, yet this is not enough ; the whole chapter specifies the distinct produce of the several countries, and not the places where the produce might accidentally be found. The septuagint render it Chalcedon 3\u00b0, which is a city on the Bosphorus ; but this seems to have arisen from a reference to the first sense of Tarshish, which is a precious stone, (Parkhurst says the topaz,) but, however, it may be doubtful whether a Chalcedony (which is an agate) or whether a topaz is meant by the septuagint. The rendering of Tarshish by Chalcedon is evidently an allusion to the name of a precious stone. voyages of Gossellin, one to Ophir and one to Tharshish. >\u00b0 XahxM, and Ka^LV are easily inter changed. \" 1 Kings, xxii. 48. \" Jehoshaphat made \u00ab ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold.\" Here the ships of Tharshish are those that go to Ophir; and this concludes against the two"], [694, "6jfi DISSERTATION II. [Part II. The Chaldee Paraphrase says expressly W\u00a3 SO Min yama ; de mari adducebant mercimonia, which is in conformity with Gossellin's opinion. The English Bible and Newcombe's translation preserve the Tarshish of the original. Let us next observe the usage of this term in scripture. It occurs first in Gen. x. 4. where the sons of Javan are Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. Now Javan is the general name for Iones 3I or Greeks, and his descendants ought to be the division of that nation, as the sons of Misraim (Gen. x. 13.) are the distinctions of the tribes of Africa. In conformity to this, Elishah has been rendered Elis, Hellas, or Peloponnesus; Kittim the Greek Isles, or perhaps Macedonia; and Doclonim Dodona, or the western side of Greece towards the Hadriatic. What then would be Tarshish ? Bochart and others are not content with this; he supposes Kittim to be Italy, and Ro danim32 for Dodanim, to be Gaul about the Rhodanus or Rhone, and Tarshish to be Spain; that is Tartessus. Park hurst likewise admits Tartessus, and Michaelis imagines, that the fleet fitted out at Eziongeber, circumnavigated the con tinent of Africa to reach Tartessus by the Indian and Atlantic Ocean. This solution he assumes, because the voyage was of three years continuance, and because Solomon had no ports on the Mediterranean. Tl.e latter reason cannot be admitted while Solomon and Hiram had a joint concern; for durino- that union, the fleet might have sailed from Tyre. But the three 31 Daniel, viii. 21. JV MeIek Javan, the King of Grecia, id. x. 20. xi. 2. j5 Rodanim is not merely an assumption of Bochart's ; it is read in several MSS. and in margin of our English Bible. The daleth an<1 r\"h are easily interchanged ; \"J for ~\\. c sJ"], [695, "ON EZEKIEL, c. xxvn. 659 years allowed for the voyage are not sufficient, if calculated by the voyage of the Ph\u0153nicians sent by Neco, which is probably the ground of Michaelis's estimate ; for they were three years in reaching the Mediterranean; and consequently the voyage round Africa to Tartessus, and back again, would require not three, but six j'ears for its completion. Upon a view of these difficulties, if we should return to Javan, and wish to establish all his family in Greece, we ought to find a situation for Tarshish in that country ; and. if this can not be done, it must be confessed that the position of Tarshish cannot be discovered by the text of Genesis the tenth. Omit ting this, therefore, for the present, we may proceed to other passages connected with the subject of inquiry. It has been proved already (from 1 Kings, xxii. 48.) that the ({ships of Tarshish built by Jehoshaphat at Eziongeber, went east to Ophir, and (from Jonah, i. 3. iv. 2.) that Jonah, by em- barking at Joppa, fled westward on the Mediterranean. Now the sea is common to both these voyages, but no one specific place, country, or city, can be common to both ; and upon a careful examination of all the passages adduced by Gossellin, and all that are to be found in the concordance, there is not one which may not be rendered justly by the sea, as Gossellin has asserted. The Vulgate and the Chaldee vary in different places, but the prevailing construction is mare or maria ; and the Vulgate (on- the 1 Kings, x. 2. xxii. 49-) has ships of Africa, which might give rise to the opinion of Montesquieu and Bruce, that Ophir was at Sofala ; but Africa is itself a suspected term in Hebrew ; for it is Latin, not used by the Hebrews, whose"], [696, "64o B I S S E R T A T I O N II. [Part II. phrase was Lubim, and little by the Greeks 3% who adopted Libya from the same origin; but in the Chaldee it is in so many letters njflgtf Africa (1 Kings, xxii. 49-)\u00bb and tllis term is doubtless, in comparison, modern. The other texts are, if any one should wish to examine them. (2 Chron. ix. 21. xx. 36, 37. Psalm xlviii. 7.

I will send them that escape to Tarshish, ad gentes in mare. Vulg. ad provincias maritimas. Chald.) Upon the evidence of all these passages, there is no hesita tion in subscribing to the opinion of Gossellin, but his double voyage down the Red Sea is by no means equally apparent. There is likewise great reason to adopt Parkhurst's idea, that they w-ere large and strong ships, fit for distant voyages; or if the reading of the septuagint (Ez. xxvii. 9.) could be admitted, we might add, that they were stout enough to pass (IttI ho-pug <W^34) to the extremities of the west, to the Atlantic and Britain ; or to the east, through (Babel Mandeb) the Straits of 33 Perhaps never till after their connection with Rome. 34 That we may not mislead, it is necessary to observe, that this term is not used in the verse under contemplation, but in v. 9. I wish to find any where an extreme western voyage, to Gades or to Britain, which I must confess is not perfectly clear."], [697, "ON EZEKIEL, c. xxvn. 641 Death, and so to the southern coast of Arabia. This account we have from scripture, and it is clear; but the voyage to Britain, though generally admitted, is far more problematical, for the evidence of Strabo JS goes only to prove, that a Ph\u0153ni cian vessel was run ashore in order to deceive the Romans, which must relate to a much later period ; and the testimony of Diodorus Siculus3* intimates, that even in his time,,, tin was brought from Britain, through Gaul, by a land carriage of thirty days, to the mouth of the Rhone, or perhaps to Mar seilles. Still that the 'I/yrians did obtain tin is manifest from Ezekiel, and that they passed the Straits of Calpe, and reached Gades at least, is certain, for the temple of Hercules in that island was the Melcartha\" of Tyre, whom, from his attributes, the Greeks styled the Tyrian Hercules. V. 13. Javan Tubal and Meshech dealt in slaves and vessels of brass, intimating probably that they all dealt in slaves, for slaves came out of the Euxine and the countries round it in all ages into Greece, and still come to Constantinople. The Greeks of course carried these or others which they obtained by piracy, to Tyre as well as other maritime cities. Brass vessels will apply more particularly to Tubal and Meshech, which are usually rendered Tibardni and Moschi, who, with the Ch&lybes and other inhabitants of the north-east angle of Asia Minor, have been in all ages, and still are the manufacturers of steel, iron, and brass, for the supply of Armenia, Persia, Greece, and all the eastern countries on the Mediterranean. (See Bus ching and Michaelis cited by Newcombe on this passage, and \u25a0\u00bb Strabo, lib. iii. p. 175. * Lib. v. 347. Wess. 37 Melcartha is Melek Cartha, the King of the City. Bochart. 4n VOL.

Tubal and Meshech are generally mentioned to gether in scripture, and Tubaleni is as naturally Tybareni, as Mesheck, which the Chaldee reads Mosock, is Moschi, while Javan, Tubal, and Mesheck, are all sons of Japhet. (Gen. x. 2.) V. 14. Togarmah traded in horses, horsemen, and mules, which\" Bochart supposes to be Cappadocia, (p. \\~15, Phaleg.) but Michaelis with much greater probability, Armenia, for Armenia and Media were the countries where the kings of Persia bred horses for the service of themselves and their armies, and in later times Armenia paid its tribute from this source. See Newcombe, who cites the Greek Scholiast on Ezekiel, and Ez. xxxviii. 6. The Chaldee renders it unaccountably by Germania. The objection to assuming Armenia for Togarma is, that Armenia is in every other passage represented by Ararat. (See particularly 2 Kings, xix. 37. and Isaiah, xxxvii. 38. and Jeremiah, li. 27.) I have not had an opportunity of consulting Michaelis Spicileg. Geographicum, and can judge of it only as it is cited in Newcombe. Ver. 15. Dedan is mentioned in conjunction with the mer chants of many isles ; they brought horns (tusks) of ivory and ebony. Dedan is strangely rendered by the septuagint Rho dians. They must, therefore, have read a resh for a daleth ; but Dedan 38 is doubtless on the southern coast of Arabia, for he is mentioned (Gen. x. 7.) with Seba, Havilab, Sheba, and 38 I follow Bochart and Michaelis in placing Dedan on the eastetn coast of Arabia, and I think they are right; but Dedan is mentioned with Tema, Jer. xxv. 23. and with Esau, xlix. 8. Tema is by Niebuhr supposed to be the Tehama, or coast of Arabia, on the Red. Sea ; and Esau is in Hedjaz.

There is still a Dadena on the coast of Oman, opposite to Cape Jasque; and a Rhegma, within the Gulph of Persia, not far from Mo- candon, is found in Ptolemy, corresponding with Raamah or Rahmah, in the opinion of Patrick. Without, however, insist- ing on these resemblances, we may be certain of the country from the other names with which it is united, and its produce; for ivory and ebony are furnished only by India aud Africa, and the province of Oman deals with both. If we read horns of ivory, with our English Bible, they are the tusks resembling horns. If horns and ivory, with archbishop Newcombe, the horns from the isles may be tortoise-shell, peculiar to the isles of India; and ebony, if Virgil be good authority, is found in India and nowhere else.

Newcombe, It is evident, therefore, that we are here first introduced to Oriental commerce, and from this verse to the 25th, every ar ticle specified is Oriental, and every place mentioned is to the east of Tyre, or connected with the trade eastward. To those who have a curiosity on this subject, this is the most re markable singularity of the chapter, and the establishment of the fact will be self-evident. The Chaldee renders horns by cornibus caprearum, and adds pavones, from the general accounts of the voyage to Ophir, but neither of these additions is justi fied by the text. V. 16. Syria was the purchaser of the manufactures of Tyre; and the Syrians brought in return, emeralds, purple, em- 4 n 2"], [700, "DISSERTATION II. [Part II. 644 broidered work, fine linen, coral, and agate. Syria, in the original, is Aram or Aramea ; and Aram, in scripture, is some times Mesopotamia, sometimes Damascus39, and likewise the country about Libanus, and the Orontes. Emeralds, fine linen40, coral, and agate\"1, are doubtless from the East; but as to the appropriation of these names specifically to different pre cious stones, it is quite indeterminate. Fine linen, and em broidered or variegated work, may be the cottons or muslins from India, but is too general a term to be depended on. Still, upon the whole, we may imagine, that all these are ar ticles brought by land from the Gulph of Persia, through Me sopotamia or Damascus, in exchange for the manufactures of Tyre. Purple and fine linen are frequently united in the lan guage of Scripture, and the usual interpretation is, fine linen of a purple colour ; of this, though Michaelis says purple would not be brought to Tyre, but exported from it, there might be an importation (see Newcombe in loco) from India through this channel. V. 17- Judah and Israel brought to Tyre wheat of minnith41, or fine wheat (Vulg. Sept. Chaldee), and pannag43, perhaps 39 Aram-Damasek is Damascus, the proper capital of Syria.

There is little fluctuation in the versions ; and though pannag. may be dubious, the other articles are the natural produce of Judah and Israel ; and balsam is from Jericho, where the plant which produces it is supposed to be native. V. 18. Damascus received the richest manufactures of Tyre, in exchange for wine of Helbon, and white wool, that is, wool in the fleece or unwrought. If Tyre bought wool in the fleece, and manufactured it, it is the same policy as Flanders adopted formerly in regard to the wool of England. The wine of Hel bon is the Chalybon of the Greeks ; the kings of Persia drank no other. (Newcombe from Strabo.) Syrian wine is still cele brated, and Laodicean wine is an article of commerce in the Peripi&s. The Eastern name of Aleppo is still Haleb; and Haleb, Halebon, or Chalybon, are only varied44 by different aspirates or Greek terminations. The river Chalus, which Xenophon mentions in the expedition of the ten thousand45, must be near the present Aleppo, or the very stream which at this day supplies that city with water. Damascus lies upon the route from Aleppo to Tyre; and to Aleppo the distance is about double that to Tyre. V. 19. Dan and Javan, going to and fro, brought iron46, and cassia, and calamus : the two last articles are evidently Oriental, 44 A much greater variation appears in the Institutes of Timour, p. 145. where it is written Hullub, either Persick or Toorki ; in either of which languages a is mutable into u, and (I conclude) e also, for Emessa is written Humsau.

We are therefore to look for this Javan, not in Greece, as before, but in Arabia, and to point out the dis tinction between the two Javans. The adjunct of the name, rendered in our English Bible going to and fro41, is in the ori ginal Me-LTzal ; and Uzal is explained by Gen. x. 27. where Uzal is the son of Joktan, joined with Hazarmaveth (Hadra maut), Sheba, Ophir, and Havilah ; all which we know to be in Arabia, and consequently Javan, Me-Uzal, is so likewise. It is unwillingly that I drop the sense of going to and fro, be cause it expresses the practice of a caravan ; but the retaining Uzal as a proper name, is justified by the Vulgate48 and Sept. and approved by Newcombe, and Michaelis, who adds, from Golius, Azal nomen Sana\u00e64' qu\u00e6 metropolis Arabi\u00e6 felicis. Michaelis supposes Dan to be Vadan, and a city of Arabia; but of Vadan i0 there are no traces in Gen. x. ; if it is Dan, one of the tribes of Israel, his situation is between the Philistines and Joppa, placed very commodiously for receiving the cara vans from Arabia in that age, which came to Rhinocolura in a later ; and equally convenient for embarking at Joppa the com modities brought by the caravans to be conveyed to Tyre. Be this as it may, the traffic is undoubtedly Arabian, and from the southern 5I coast ; for (iTJp) khiddah, is cassia, the cassia lignea of the ancients, from (1P) khadh s% to cut or divide lengthways, \u00ab From azal, to go. *\u25a0 Hazarmaveth, Havilah, Ophir, and Sheba, 4' Mozel, vulg.

The (ni\u00a3) khaneh likewise, or reed, if it be the calamus aromaticus, is of Indian growth. There can be no doubt therefore remaining, but that this verse fully establishes the intercourse of Tyre with India, through the intervention of Arabia ; and no doubt that the Arabians went to India, or ships of India came to Arabia. This circumstance consequently must have taken place previous to the siege of Tyre, at latest s4 560 years before Christ ; and this passage is therefore the most ancient record of the trade between India and Arabia, which can be called historical; for though spices are mentioned frequently, that term is not decisive, as all the gums and odours of Arabia are comprehended under that name. Cinnamon, kasia, and calamus, alone prove an Indian origin; and not withstanding these are noticed by Moses, David, and Solomon, the conveyance of them by caravans from the southern coast of Arabia is no where specified, till we arrive at this passage in Ezekiel. V. 20. Dedan imported precious clothes for chariots. Dedan is introduced before (v. 15.) : it may be the same country again, that is, Oman. But in this verse there is nothing to express whether these clothes are a manufacture, or an import from countries farther to the east. V. 21.

Kedar signifies black, and Bochart concludes from this, that they were Arabs burnt by the sun ; but that it refers to the tents is evident from Canticles, i. 5. I am black, but Comely \" as the tents of Kedar. These, therefore, are the Arabs of Hedjaz ; they have no fixed habitation, but wander throughout the Sahara*6; and their only wealth, besides what they obtain by robbery, consists in their flocks and herds. The produce of these they brought to exchange for the manufactures of Tyre. V. 22. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah brought all kinds of the finest odours, precious stones and gold. Between Sheba (with shin) and Seba (with samech) there appears a dis tinction ; for Sheba is a descendant of Shem, and Seba of Ham, Gen. x. Seba is, by some, taken exclusively for Sabea, but both are in Arabia. The mistake, however, of one for the other, is natural, as there is a Sheba\" also, great grandson of Ham. But mentioned as Sheba is in this passage with Raamah, and connected as it is with Dedan (v. 20.), we may conclude that -the great grandson of Ham is meant, the son of Raamah, who is son of Cush. Gush, likewise, is much more properly attributed to Arabia than Ethiopia, though frequently rendered Ethiopia in our English Bible. If this may be esteemed a clue to guide us, we may place this Sheba, with Raamah sS (Rhegma) and Dedan (Daden), towards the south-east angle of Arabia, \" See she Song of Maisuna, wife of Moa- \" Compare Gen. x. 7. with the same wiah, in Abilfeda, Reiske, p. 116. which pre- chap. 28. sents a true picture of the manners of the *8 Raamah is Rema in the Vulgate, and Arabs in the Desert.

Of precious stones there can be little doubt ; and that gold should be brought from India, is a circumstance in con formity with the Peripluis ; for if the- merchant carried silver to the Indian market, he had a considerable profit by exchanging it for gold. V. 23, 24. Haran, C&nneh, Eden, with the merchants of Sheba, Ashur, and Chilmad, traded in blue clothes, broidered work, or work of various colours \u2014 in chests of rich apparel, made of cedar and bound wi.th cords. That this expresses generally the trade with Mesopotamia and Assyria there can be little question ; but Sheba mentioned again with these places, causes great obscurity. It may be too much to say, that these articles came up the Gulph of Persia, from Sheba or Oman to Babylonia and Mesopotamia, and thence by caravans to Tyre ; but the chests of cedar bound with cords seem to imply great caution adopted for the preservation of the clothes, which were the costly manufacture of Babylonia, if not of India; and this caution seems more necessary for a conveyance over land, not only to prevent injury to the goods, but robbery likewise. But Michaelis, as I learn from Archbp. Newcombe, goes counter to this whole supposition. With him, Haran is Haran-al-carin in Arabia; Canneh is the Kane of Hadramaut; Eden is Aden in Sabea, or Yemen ; Sheba is a different place from Sheba in the verse preceding, and Chilmad is left unde termined. vol. it. 4o"], [706, "DISSERTATION II.

Against such autho rity as Michaelis, I must not stand on my defence with my own forces, but call in auxiliaries, who have as high a claim to consideration as Michaelis himself. The single name of Asshur, enumerated with the other places in this passage, is sufficient to convince us that they are not in Arabia, but Assyria\"; for Asshur is the son of Shem Gen. x. 21.), joined with Elam6\u00b0, Elymais, or Persia, and Aram, Aramea, or Syria; and the invariable usage of Asshur for As syria, does not admit of altering its application in this single passage. Haran and Eden are mentioned in conjunction (2 Kings, xix. 12. Bochart), and Haran, written Hharan or Charan in the original, is Charr\u00e6 near Edessa61, celebrated for the defeat of Crassus in later times, and more anciently for the residence of Abraham (Gen. xi. 31.), when he left Ur of the \" Grotius supports this. *' Edessa was a great mart for OrientaL traffick, as early as the decline of the Syrian dynasty of the Seleucid\u00e6 : it continued so till the time of the Mahomedan irruption, and in the age of the Crusades became a Christian principality.

(Bochart, d'Anville.) Eden, Adana, and Aden, is a name found indeed in Arabia and in other places, and its signification might readily be the cause of this; for the Garden of Eden is the Garden of Delight, and various places, possessed of a desirable situation, might assume this distinction; but joined with Haran, as it is here, and in the second book of Kings, it must be in Assyria, and no where else ; for in the latter passage it is put into the mouth of Rabshekah, and Rab shekah was an Assyrian. Canneh likewise is read Calneh by Grotius, Houbigant, and Bochart, (mentioned Gen. x. 10. Isaiah, x. 9. and Amos, vi. 2.)

That the commodities of the East will bear a long and expensive land-carriage, we may be assured by the caravans which traversed the whole continent of Asia, from China to the Mediterranean, in former ages ; and those which pass between the same empire and Russia at the present day- That the Tyrians should be employed in the same concern, is natural, from our knowledge of their commercial spirit, and from the profits of their monopoly in regard to Europe. Whether the knowledge of these gains, or the thirst of con- quest, induced Nebuchadnezzar to destroy this city, may be questioned ; but I have already shewn that he had improved the navigation of the Tigris, and established a port on the- Gulph of Persia. In this there could be no object but a com- munication with the East ; and when the Babylonian empire sunk under the power of Persia, Tyre rose again out of its ruins, because the Persians were neither navigators nor merchants, and because the fleets of Xyre were essential to the prosecution of those conquests which the Persians meditated towards the West. The destruction of Tyre is foretold by Isaiah (xxiii.) and Jeremiah (xxv. 22. xlvii. 4.), as well as by Ezekiel, who em ploys three chapters upon the subject, and enters far more minutely into particulars.

With these observations I close the review of this extraordinary prophecy relating to Tyre and its commerce ; and if the Peri plus affords us the means of tracing the countries it describes, by the specification of their native produce ; equally appro priate, or more abundantly so, are the articles contained in the enumeration of the Prophet; the latter part of which coincides most essentially with the detail in the Periplds. and establishes the consistency and veracity of both.

DISSERTATION III. ON THE NAVIGATION AND COMPASS OF THE CHINESE, BY THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF MACARTNEY. IN my Journal of 11th August 1793, I gave some account of the junkas and shipping employed by the Chinese, and ex pressed my astonishment at their obstinacy in not imitating the ingenuity and dexterity of Europeans, in the built and man\u0153uvre of their vessels, after having had such striking examples before their eyes for these 250 years past: but I must now in a good measure retract my censure upon this point ; as, from what I have since observed in the course of my several voyages on the rivers and canals of China. I confess that I believe the yachts, and other craft usually em pi ojed upon them for the conveyance of passengers and merchandize, and the Chinese boatmen's manner of conducting and managing them, are perfectly well calculated for the purposes intended, and probably superior to any other that we, in our vanity, might advise them to adopt. With regard to vessels of a different kind for more distant voyages, to Batavia, Manilla, Japan, or Cochin-china, I am informed that the Chinese of Canton, who have had frequent"], [713, "ON THE CHINESE COMPASS. $5? opportunities of seeing our ships there, are by no means in sensible of the advantages they possess over their own ; and that a principal merchant there, some time since, had ordered a large vessel to be constructed according to an English model ; but the Hou-pou, being apprized of it, not only forced him to relinquish his project, but made him pay a considerable fine for his delinquency, in presuming to depart from the ancient established modes of the empire, which, according to his no tions, must be wiser and better than those of the barbarous nations, which come from Europe to trade here. It is indeed as I have before remarked, the prevailing system of the Tartar government, to impress the people with an idea of their own sufficiency, and to undervalue in their eyes, as much as pos sible, the superior invention of foreign nations ; but their vigilance in this respect, and the pains they take for the pur pose, evidently betray the conscious fears and jealousy they entertain of their subjects' taste for novelty, and their sagacity in discovering, and washing to adopt, the various articles of European ingenuity for use, convenience, and luxury, in pre ference to their own clumsy, old-fashioned contrivances1. The government also probably apprehended danger from our teach ing their subjects things of which they are now ignorant, but which they would be willing enough to learn.

Be that as it may, the best writers agree that it was not known in Europe till the thirteenth century, nor brought into general use till the latter end of the fifteenth; but whether communi cated by Marco Polo on his return from China, or by some other adventurer, remains undecided. The plan of it, accord ing to its division into thirty-two points, seems to indicate it rather an intended European improvement upon something al ready discovered, than to be an original invention. The Chinese Compass being divided only into twenty-four points, it was easy to divide eight more; and yet, even with this im- \u25a0 Barthema expressly mentions charts aboard a Chinese vessel.

Whoever it Mas that originally introduced the Mariner's Compass, as now used, of thirty-two points, could not have been extensively versed in science; for, long before the dis covery of the magnetic needle, philosophers of all nations had agreed to divide the circle into 360 equal parts or degrees, a degree into CO minutes, a minute into 60 seconds, &c. &c. The reason, I presume, of the general adoption and con tinuance of these numbers, is the convenience of their being divisible into integral parts by so many different numbers. The points of our mariner's compass, however, happen not to be among these numbers, for 36*0 divided by 32, gives llf de grees, so that, except the four cardinal points and their four bisecting points, all the others converted into degrees, will be involved with fractions, a circumstance of great inconvenience> although thought immaterial by seamen, who have tables for every minute of a degree ready calculated to their hands.

[Part II. 662 Founded on these motives, an application was made in the year 1804 to Lord Hobart, then Secretary of State for the foreign department, who, with the liberality congenial to his disposition, and the alacrity of a protector of the sciences, di rected the necessary inquiries to be made without delay. Mr. Watson, who had resided at Venice forty years, and who was the English Consul in that city, was consulted. That gentleman was well acquainted with the map, and had fre quently visited it as an object of curiosity ; he offered the ser vices of his nephew, Mr. Frazer, a miniature painter by pro fession, to undertake the work, and stated that the expence of a sac simile copy conld not be less than an hundred and fifty pounds'.

The connexion of this work with the plan of the editor, arises natural!}*- from the construction of his Commentaries on the Voyage of Nearchus and the Peripl&s of the Erythrean Sea ; in these two works he undertook not only to elucidate the nar rative, but to embrace all the leading causes which contributed to the better information of the moderns ; \u2014 in short, to trace the Progress of Discovery from the commencement of it by Nearchus, to its completion by the voyage of Gama. After a brief enumeration of these particulars we may proceed to consider : I. First, whether this was the map noticed by Ramusio, and supposed by him to be drawn up for the elucidation of the Travels of Marco Polo. Upon the commencement of this inquiry it is necessary to have it understood, that the Planisphere of Fra Mauro was never intended by the author for the purpose of tracing the route of his countryman : it contains indeed many particulars deduced from his Memoir, but without any acknowledgement of the obligation \\ It is a general map of the known world, formed upon the Arabian principle, and its outline is repre sented by the sketch I have given from Al Edrissi, in the Ap- 3 The Memoir of Father Mirtarelli, Abbot the map, I find ao reason to contradict thi\u00ab of St. Michael di Murato, in 1779, asserts assertion. this j and upon a scrupulous examination of"], [724, "664 DISSERTATION IV. [Part II. pendix to the first part of the Peri phis ; that is, a circle sur rounded by a circumambient ocean ; or if considered as a hemi sphere, it is the egg4 floating in a bason of water. I ventured to predict this to some of my subscribers before its arrival, and to shew that consequently, if the three Con tinents were encompassed by this mare tenebrosum of the Arabs, Africa must have a termination on the south, as well as Lapland on the north. . That the Atlantic s communicated with the Indian ocean was a persuasion universally admitted from the earliest ages by all the geographers, except Ptolemy; he indeed carried round his Southern Continent from the extremity of Africa till it joined the empire of China : the Arabians, who followed Ptolemy, did not copy him in this respect, but the termination of Africa in Al Edrissi is protracted eastward till it ends under the same meridian as China ; the map of Marin Sanuto6 in 1321, which is likewise from an Arabian original, has the same inclination, but not to the same excess ; and the planisphere of Fra Mauro has a similar turn to the east, but confined within still narrower bounds. The additional information which Fra Mauro gives, will be considered under the third head. But let us now advert to the report of Ramusio relative to the map in the church of St. Michael di Murano, given at p. 229. 4 It is not by this intended to assert, that xoiwvSc-a ir^k ti'i e\u00a3\u00ab r~,?dii Bahaa-o-av.

Now, comparing this opposition of circumstances, it seems as if we must conclude, that unless there were two planispheres in the church, \u2014 both drawn up by a lay brother, \u2014 both visited by strangers,\u2014 both containing a termination of Africa; \u2014 this must be the map that Ramusio has recorded, and that the erroneous side of the account must be attributed to the neglect of the reporter. This is a harsh judgment, for Ramusio is the most faithful, correct, and accurate of collectors ; he lived at Venice himself, and as he could not want opportunity of ascertaining the fact, neither can we well attribute to him the want of curiosity or investigation. But it is very extraordinary that Ramusio 9, who lived within fifty years of Fra Mauro, should never have mentioned him by name, but only noticed the ' Converso, in the Italian, means a Fra, or pears that it was removed from the church to Friar professed, but not ordained ; the or- the hall, and from the hall to the library, in dained Priests are Padres, or Fathers, in the 1655, when the library was repaired and order of Calmes. beautified. 8 By a testimonial on the map itself, it ap- 9 He died in 1557, at 72 years of age VOL.

This neglect cannot be imputed to jealousy, for his rival was no more ; neither is it more remarkable than that Fra Mauro, who has copied so amply from Marco Polo, should never mention his name. Considering, however, farther inquiry into these particulars as unnecessary, I cannot suppress my own opinion, which is, that this was the map intended by Ra musio, but that his information is not correct. And in addition to my own testimony, I may subjoin, that in a memoir of this map, drawn up by Father Jo. Benet Mirtarelli, Abbot of St. Michael di Murano in 1779, and communicated to Lord Hobart by Mr. Stuart, it is throughout admitted that this planisphere, and no other, is the one designated by Ramusio, and that his account of it is erroneous. It is much to be regretted that we have no genuine map that can be traced to Marco Polo himself, \u2014 for that which was in the Doge's palace, (a copy of which I received from Lord Macartney,) is by internal evidence later than 1550; it is not formed on Arabian principles, it has the peninsula of India, and that of Malacca, in conformity to the Portuguese dis coveries; it has the Eastern Islands and the Moluccas almost correct; and the only trace of its derivation from an ancient source, or an age prior to Gama, is, that the first country east of China is Spain ; proving, in this one instance at least, that it was copied from some authority previous to the discovery of America."], [727, "MAP OF FRA MAURO. 667 II. Under the second head we are to inquire, whether the work we have is genuine ? whether it were really executed by Fra Mauro ? and whether it existed previous to the voyage of Gama ? The proof of this is very short, for the age of Fra Mauro is perfectly ascertained in the history of the monastery ; his ex cellence as a cosmographer is fully established by the medal struck in honour of him ; the inscription on which is, \u2014 Frater Maurus Monachus Camaldunensis Sancti Michaelis de Muriano Cosmographus incomparabilis : the date on the planisphere is 1459, and the internal evidence in the work itself is in com plete harmony with the date. Added to this, we know by the testimony of the Portuguese, that Alfonso V. or Prince Henry, who died in 1663, received a copy of this map from Venice, and deposited it in the monastery of Alcobaca, where it is still preserved I0. It is in fact calculated for the furtherance of Prince Henry's designs ; for it asserts that an Indian ship had been carried 2000 miles west beyond the extreme point of Africa, and that the Portuguese navigators had sailed 2000 miles south, from the Straits of Gibraltar; by this implying, that the junction of these two lines could not be a labour of very great difficulty, and that the prosecution of the discovery must soon lead to the attainment of the object proposed.

The whole of his reign there- 4q 2"], [728, "DISSERTATION IV. [Part II. 668 the whole memoir of Abbot Mirtarelli confirms this, and puts the question out of doubt. III. This brings us to the third head, in which we are to shew what the Planisphere actually contains relative to the termina tion of Africa on the south. This is in reality the prime curiosity and great merit of the work, for its defects in other respects are in perfect harmony with the ignorance of the age ; nay, there are some errors which, if the author had followed Ptolemy, as he professes to do, he could not have committed. His failure in regard to India is inexcusable, for though Ptolemy might have misled him, as he has, in regard to curtailing the peninsula of India, and reduc ing both coasts nearly to one parallel of latitude, still Ptolemy has an Indus and a Ganges not so much distorted as to pro duce the enormous aberration of Fra Mauro ; for he places Dehly on a stream which comes towards the coast of Malabar ; he then carries an Indus into the bay of Bengal ; another river running down to Ava, Pegu, and Siam ; and to the eastward of this a Ganges. This is so wild an error, that it is not worth seeking for its origin. There are a variety of misconceptions in other parts, though none so extravagant as this. But not to insist on these, let us now advert to the termination of Africa, the principal object in view, when it was proposed to obtain a copy of this work, and the leading cause for introducing it to the notice of the reader. Longitude and latitude, though the author frequently men tions, he does not apply ; he sixes the centre of the habitable -world near Bagdat, and would willingly have, fixed it at Jeru salem if he could have found the means."], [729, "MAP OF FRA MAURO. 669 Asia and Europe he defines rationally, and Africa, so far as regards its coast on the Mediterranean. He traces the Nile up into Abyssinia, of which he has two heads, one towards the east, from the Arabian accounts, where several streams unite into three lakes\"; and another western one, which he calls Ab-avi, as well as Bruce, which winds round, and after pass ing through a lake resembling Dembea, returns again to the north like that river ; but both these sources partake Jess of the errors of Ptolemy and the Arabs than might be expected ; they are not carried quite so far south I3, and on this head it is highly probable that he received his information from the missionaries and merchants who had been in Egypt, and perhaps farther inland I4. This he professes to be the source of his intelligence, and it appears rational, from a view of his work ; but then, as he knew nothing of Africa more remote than this region, he extends Abyssinia down to the south, till it is almost in contact with what we should call the country of the Hottentots Is. On the eastern coast, however, of this continent, he has, a different system; for having found, as we may suppose, in of Abyssinia is dubious, unless from M. Polo. We know of no missionaries who penetrated into that country previous to the Portuguese in 1520, sixty years later tiian the date of the Planisphere. 12 This is the precise fact also in the Ara bian map of Al Edrissi, and Fra Mauro co pies him likewise in making the stream pass through a mountain, with the cataracts, &c. &c. This source, by its relative situation, o-uo-ht to be the Tacazze, but it is remark able that the Mareb river of Bruce, which joins the Tacazze, actually does sink under ground and rise again. '3 The sources of the Nile, at least Bruce's Nile, are in latitude 12\u00b0 north, those of Pto lemy 1 20 south, and those of Al Edrissi still much farther south. 15 It is very remarkable, that his termina tion of Abyssinia on the south is formed by a river named Galla, which proves that the Gailas, who have been the invaders and deso laters of Abyssinia for these 300 years, even in that age had the appellation, and that their country was placed to the south. In fact, the intelligence of the author, in some particulars* is as singular, as his errors are in others,. 14 \"Whence the author derived his knowledge"], [730, "670 DISSERTATION IV. [Part II. Marco Polo, that there was a great island called Zanguebar IS, 2000 miles in circumference, he actually carries an arm of the sea between this island and the continent, in an oblique direc tion, commencing at Magadoxo, and issuing at the point where we should fix the Cape of Good Hope. This island (perhaps from a corruption of the Hindoo, Dweep ,7) he calls Diab three times over, and the termination of it on the south he styles Cape Diab, making it the extreme point of Africa ; and adding, in one place, that nothing ever passed it ; in another, that an Indian ship, in the year 1420, had been carried 2000 miles to the westward of it in the space of 40 days, and was 70 in returning. That the island Diab was in one sense the Zanguebar of Marco Polo, is evident, for on the eastern coast of it we have Magadoxo, Zangtiebar, and Sofala, in due order18; we have likewise, inland, a province abounding in gold, which we suppose to correspond with Monomotapa. But the last place mentioned on the east is Macdesin *% approaching so nearly to the Madastar or Magaster of Marco Polo, as to induce a suspicion that Diab may have been confounded with Mada- gascar. 16 Zanguebar is in reality a small island on the coast, in lat. 6\u00b0 south, and the continent oppo site either gives its name to or takes it from the island : it is this continent that M. Polo has transformed into an island again, 2000 miles in circumference, perhaps from Arabian autho rity, for the Arabs apply the term to many regions which are not islands. I am indebted to Mr. Hastings. 18 Quiloa, written Chelua, Brava, and Mombaza, are inserted, but not in due order ; they are all below Sofala, and Sofala is ap parently repeated twice. 19 I am not without doubt respecting this Macdesin. I have sometimes suspected it may have been intended for Mosambique. _f For this curious and rational conjecture 7"], [731, "MAP OF FRA M AU R O. 671 It is not meant to assert, however, that this suspicion is well founded ; for Fra Mauro has an island Mahal, where he says the pirates used to rendezvous, and where there was plenty of amber; this last particular Marco Polo attributes to his Ma- dastar I0, but the Mahal of F. Mauro is a small island, and the Madastar of M. Polo is 3000 miles in circumference, in which again it agrees better with Diab. At Diab, likewise, Fra Mauro mentions the fable of the Ruck, which M. Polo notices as existing in Madastar, and this increases the probability in favour of the conjecture that Madagascar is confounded with the continent. But, upon the whole, the narrative of M. Polo is far more consistent with truth than Fra Mauro's Planisphere ; and his account of the violent current in the Mosambique chan nel is a most illustrious geographical verity, far surpassing the information of the age he lived in. Let us now proceed to the specific pre-eminence of the Plani sphere, in which it surpasses all the intelligence received* from prior geographers. It has been observed already, that this work was composed with a view to encourage the Portuguese in the prosecution of their voyages to the south ; two passages, which may be adduced from the rubrick in the map\", will set this in the clearest light.

But still it is to be observed, that the two accounts are at variance: the first says, the pas sage was made round Cape Diab, at the termination of Africa ; the second asserts that it was beyond Cape Sofala and Prasum 2*, which is fifteen degrees north of that termination ; and a course winding round the continent from Sofala to Cape Agulhas2' could not be less than two-and-twenty degrees, that is, upwards of thirteen hundred geographical, or fifteen hundred British miles; if, therefore, there is no exaggeration in the account of the astronomer, this vessel might have passed five hundred miles beyond Cape Agulhas to the west. One reason more especially which may persuade us that the 2000 miles are rather to be reckoned from Sofala than Diab is, that a south and south westerly course would actually carry them towards Cape Agul has, whereas from Diab, such a course would have carried them 2000 miles into the open sea, leaving the continent behind them in the north-east. Another reason for reckoning from Sofala is, that it was the last place on the eastern coast to which the Indian ships traded, and if a vessel, making this port, happened to overshoot it, she might easily be hurried further south by the violent current in the Mosambique chan nel, which sets all round the coast to Cape Agulhas; and in the force of which, if a vessel was once caught, she might well be seventy days in returning on the same track which she had before passed in forty, when going to the south. - Isole Verde.

I have stated the whole fact as it may be viewed in either light, and leave the determination to the judgment of the reader. In either case, if there is no exaggeration, the extreme point of Africa was really passed, and the discovery ascertained. But whether the course of this Indian vessel be actually true or false does not enter into the consideration; the fact is pos sible, and even probable; and if such a report was brought to Fra Mauro, the insertion of it in his map was not only allow able, but consistent with the design of his work, composed for the King of Portugal and the encouragement of his subjects. It is reasonable to suppose that the author did not foresee that the consequence'of the discovery would be a fatal stroke to the commerce of his country, otherwise we may be assured, that neither his own patriotism, or the interests of Venice, would have suffered such a communication to have been transmitted. Let us next observe, that Fra Mauro asserts he had his in formation from a person of credit who actually sailed on board an Indian ship. In this there is no inconsistency, for the mer chants of Venice, and other Italians who traded to Alexandria, did in several instances pass down the Red Sea, and penetrate into India. Nicola di Conti30, in 1420, sailed in an Indian ship, and gives much the same account of Indian navigation. 30 Nicola di Conti was a Venetian : he too early, but the date of his return in 1444 went by way of Damascus to Bagdat, Basra, comes so near the time of Fra Mauro, whose andOrmus: he was long absent, and after his map_was completed in 1459, that he might return received absolution from the Pope in easily have consulted him. See Ramusio, J444. I may have placed his going out to India torn. i. p. 338. 4 R 2"], [736, "e76 DISSERTATION IV. [Part II. The date of 1420 is a remarkable coincidence, but di Conti says nothing in his own memoir of a ship being carried round the termination of Africa, otherwise I should have supposed that this curious traveller had actually been the origin of Fra Mauro's report : at present it only goes to prove that several Italians did pass into the Indian ocean, and did sail on board the ships of the natives, from some one of whom the author might have received his information. Another observation occurs upon reading these two accounts ; from the mention of the 2000 miles that this Indian ship had passed, and the 2000 miles that the Portuguese navigators had discovered from the Straits of Gibraltar, it is manifest that Fra Mauro thought that the intermediate line which would join the two courses was neither extensive or attended with great difficulty. But let us advert to the date of the Planisphere 14595 from which we may ascertain the extent of the progress of the Portuguese ; for it is exactly four years before the death of Prince Henry in 1463, the limit of whose discovery we fix at Rio Grande, though Galvan informs us, that a single ship or two had run down below the equator. Rio Grande is in latitude 11\u00b0 N. and the Straits of Gibraltar in lat. 36\u00b0 N. The Portuguese had therefore advanced 25 degrees to the south ; that is, 1500 geographical, or 1750 miles British, which, with the circuit of the coast, may well be estimated at 2000 miles. But as Cape Agulhas is in latitude nearly 35\u00b0 south, the amount from 36\u00b0 north to 35\u00b0 south is 71 degrees, equal to 4970 British miles ; so that if we reckon the 2000 miles of the Indian ship from Cape Diab, and the 2000 miles of the Portuguese from the Straits of Gibraltar, the intermediate line would be 3"], [737, "MAP OF FRA MAURO. 677 970 miles, exclusive of the winding of the coast; or if we reckon the 2000 miles of the Indian ship as commencing from Sofala, we must add 15 degrees in a right line, or 22 degrees of coast, as the space between the discovery of the Indians and the Portuguese : that is, in one instance we must add 1050 to 970, making 2020 miles British, and in the other 1540 to 970, amounting to 2510 miles of the same description. Different as this may seem from the estimation of Fra Mauro, and protracted as the intermediate line between the two dis coveries may appear, even if this had been known in the court of Portugal, the difficulty would not have been thought too great to surmount. The Portuguese had already extended their discoveries 2000 miles, and an additional progress of 2500 would have been deemed much easier to complete, than the first 2000 they had advanced. But they did not calculate upon so ample a space ; the estimation of Fra Mauro evidently di minished their apprehensions, and his error in this respect manifestly contributed to the prosecution of their designs ; as the error of the ancient geographers in approximating China to Europe, produced the discovery of America by Columbus. With these considerations we may close our account of Fra Maun/s Planisphere, so far as it regards the circumnavigation of Africa : and when we reflect that Diaz sailed from Lisbon in 1486, only twenty-seven years after the date of this Plani sphere, we cannot withhold a due share of praise and admira tion from a geographer, who contributed so essentially to the discovery ; neither can we sufficiently commend the wisdom of Alphonso V. who joined theory to practice by the purchase of such a work ; or the fortitude and perseverance of his people."], [738, "6;8 DISSERTATION IV. [Part II. who completed for the world the greatest discovery that navi gation has to boast. The remaining parts of the Planisphere are not connected with these great designs, neither do they contribute much to elucidate the navigation of the ancients. The merchant of the PeriplAs had far better conceptions of the eastern coast of Africa and the Peninsula of India than are to be found in this work of Fra Mauro; for he seems, by his own confession, to have consulted missionaries, voyagers, merchants, and tra vellers, more than the works of authors ancient or modern ; and yet, with all its errors, it is a performance of immense la bour, persevering research, and great curiosity of collection : the Rubrick inscribed upon it amply supplies the place of a memoir, and almost in every instance suggests a variety of re flections to those who are admirers of the science.

The doubts of Natural His torians on this subject are numerous, and Salmasius, after much learned disquisition, leaves the question undetermined. (See article Kostamomum.) But the opinion of my friend Dr. B. is this, that the kardamomum differs from the amomum chiefly as to its outward appearance in the shape of the pod or the vessels in which it is contained. The true amomum, he says, is from Java, its pod is in the shape of a nasturtium, under which title it is described by Pliny, while the kardamomum is in the form of an heart. It is brought from Sumatra, Cey lon, and Africa. The Sumatran approaches nearest that of Java, both in shape and flavour, but none of the sorts are equal to the Javan ; the flavour is aromatic, warm, and pun gent, in which qualities it is resembled by all those species which take the addition of amomum, and I have been favoured with specimens of all the different sorts by Dr. B.

An hundred years later than the Periplsis, it had found a place in the Digest: the custom-house at Alexandria received not the imports of one merchant only, but every thing that found its way by any conveyance from the East.

It is a species of cinnamon, and manifestly the same as what we call cinnamon at this day ; but different from that of the Greeks and Romans, which was not a bark, nor rolled up into pipes like ours- Their's was the tender shoot of the same plant, and of much higher value, sold at Rome in the proportion of a thousand denarii15 to fifty; it was found only in the possession of Em perors and Kings ; and by them it was distributed in presents to favourites, upon solemn occasions, embassies, Sec. That it was the tender shoot, and not hollow, may be proved from Pliny, lib. xii. 19? where he informs us that Vespasian was the first that dedicated crowns of cinnamon inclosed in gold filagree (auro interrasili) in the Capitol, and the Temple of Peace ; and that Livia dedicated the root in the Palatine Tem ple.of Augustus; after which he adds, that the casia is of a larger size than the cinnamon (crassiore sarmento), and has a thin rind rather than a bark, and its value consists in being hollowed out (exinaniri pretium est). He adds, that the best sort has a short pipe of this rind or coating (brevi tunicarum fistulA, et non fragili, lege et fragili) ; this Casia is manifestly a Cinnamon, and by consulting the two chapters of Dioscorides on Casia and Cinnamon, the best casia called Daphnitis, at Alexandria, is doubtless the same.

Ex.) but if our cinnamon is the ancient casia, our casia is again an inferior sort of cinnamon ; both are known to our druggists and grocers ; and since the conquest of Ceylon, the duty is lowered on our cinnamon, and raised on our casia. The reason of which is plain ; because the true and best cinnamon is wholly our own by the possession of Ceylon, and casia is procurable from Sumatra, and several of the eastern isles. (See Marsden's Sumatra, p. 125.) It is plain, therefore, that we adopt cinnamon for the casia of the ancients, and casia for an inferior cinnamon. Whether the cinnamon and casia of the ancients were both from the same plant, may be doubted ; for there are different species even of the best sorts, as we learn from Thunberg ; but that both had the same virtue, though not equal in degree, we are assured by Galen, who informs us, that two parts of casia are equal to one of cinnamon. (Mat thioli, p. 46.) And Galen examined both when he composed the Theriac for the emperor Severus. I am confirmed in the opinion I had formed by Dr. Falconer, who (after citing Linn\u00e6us, Combes, Philos.

But that the casia fistula and the casia lignea are marked as the two leading distinct species, from the time of Moses to the present hour, is self-evident. And I now say, that if the Romans applied the term Cinnamon to the tender shoot of this plant, and not to the pipe cinnamon, such as we now have it from Ceylon, their use of the word was improper. That this was the case, there is reason to think ; but that there was some obscurity or fluctuation in their usage, is cer tain also. Salmasius15 quotes Galen to prove that the plant itself was brought to the emperor Marcus Aurelius, from Barbarike 2S, in a case seven feet long. Galen saw this, and there were other cases of a smaller size, containing specimens of an inferior sort.

Undoubtedly it was, for the plant itself, and the spice, as we have it, in its usual form, have this dif- ference and no more. But Galen says, in another passage17, that casia and cinnamon are so much alike that it is not an easy matter to distinguish one from the other. And Dioscorides writes, \" Casia grows in Arabia ; the best sort is red, of a fine \" colour, almost approaching to coral, strait, long, and pipy, \" it bites upon the palate with a slight sensation of heat, and \" the best sort is that called Zigir, with a scent like a rose.\" This is manifestly the cinnamon we have at this day ; but he adds, \" cinnamon has many names, from the different places \" where it [is procured or] grows. But the best sort is that \" which is like the casia of Mosyllon, and this cinnamon is \" called Mosyllitic, as well as the casia.\" This therefore is only a different sort of the same spice, but it does not grow either in Arabia or at Mosyllon28, it took its name from either country, as procured in the marts of either. This traffic is explained in the Periplus, but Dioscorides was unacquainted with it. The description29 he gives of this cinnamon is, \" That \" when fresh, and in its greatest perfection, it is of a dark \" colour, something between the colour of wine and [dark] ash, \" like a small twig or spray full of knots, and very odoriferous.\" This is manifestly not our cinnamon, but the same as Galen's, the tender shoot and not the bark. It is worth remarking that Dioscorides lived in the reign of Nero 30, and if the true source of cinnamon was then just beginning to be known by means of \u2022\u00bb See Ramusio, vol. i. p. 282.

Pliny who lived a few years later had jest arrived at this information, for he says expressly, Mosyllon was the port to which cinnamon was brought^, and consequently the port where it was procured by the Greeks from Egypt, and through Egypt conveyed to Rome. It had long been procured there, and long obtained the name of Mo syllitie, but it was now known not to be native, but imported at that place. The trade to Mosyllon was opened by the Ptolemies ; still, before the existence of a Grecian power in Egypt, the Greeks had probably little knowledge of it, but from the importation of it by the Phenicians; and the Ph\u0153nicians received it, either by land-carriage from the Idumeans of Arabia, or when they navigated the Red Sea themselves with the fleets of Solomon, they obtained it immediately from Sabea; perhaps also, if Ophir is Sofala on the coast of Africa, they found it. either at that port, or at the others, which the Greeks afterwards frequented. These lay chiefly in Barbaria, (the kingdom of Adel,) comprehending the ports of Mosyllon, Malao, and Mundus, where it was possibly always to be met with. This commerce is at best only conjectural, neither could it be of long duration, as it ended with the reign of Solomon, and was never resumed ; but that the Phenicians had a settled inter course with Sab\u00a3a we learn incontrovertibly from Ezekiel33, and that Sabea was the centre of Oriental commerce, is proved in our account of the Peripltis. 31 Dioscorides was a native of Anazarba ; 35 Portns Mosyllites quo cinnamomum de but whether he wrote there or at Rome, I vehitur.

Fable is the legitimate progeny of ignorance ; we are not to wonder, therefore, when we read in Herodotus lA, that casia grew in Arabia, but that cinnamon was brought thithes by birds from the country where Bacchus was born, that is India. The term used by Herodotus Indicates the cin namon we now have; for it signifies the peel, hull, or rind35 of a plant, and evidently points out the bark, under which form we still receive this spice. The error of Herodotus is repeated by Theophrastus, who assigns both casia and cinnamon to Arabia36: this intelligence I receive from Bochart; and I am obliged to him also for a very curious citation from Uranius, in Stephanus de Urbibus, who sa}s, the country of the Abasenes produces myrrh, aromatic gums or odours, frankincense, and the bark [of cinnamon}37. This passage is valuable as the first instance extant in which the name of Abyssinians is mentioned. - But it is not to be depended on, unless it can be referred to the conquests of that nation in Arabia, for these Abascni are evi dently joined with the Arabians of Sabea aud Hadramaut. 3* Lib. iii. p- 252. ed.

This admits of proof from the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, and we have traced the course of their introduction in the preliminary disquisitions of the first book. We may now, therefore, proceed to examine the various sorts of this spice mentioned in the Periplus, which amount to ten ; and very remarkable it is, that the modern enumeration of professor Thunberg should comprehend just as many species. Not that it is to be supposed the species correspond, but the coincidence of number is extraordinary. It is worthy of notice also, that cinnamon is a term never used in the Periplils ; the merchant dealt only in casia; cinnamon was a o-ift for princes. There is, even in this minute circumstance, a pre sumption in favour of his veracity, not to be passed without observation. It has been already mentioned in the account of Ceylon, that the ancients, who first referred this spice to Arabia, and after wards to the cinnamomifera regio in Africa, as supposing it to grow in those countries because they procured it there, never mention it in Ceylon. I think, with Sir William Jones, that this is one of the obscurest circumstances in ancient commerce. Can we conceive that it grew there in any age, and was after wards eradicated ? or must we not rather conclude, in con formity to the suffrages of all the moderns, that there is no genuine cinnamon but that of Ceylon, and that the commerce 1"], [771, "APPENDIX. 7u itself was a mystery ? The first author that mentions cinna mon in Ceylon is the Scholiast on Diony'sius Periegetes ; at least I have met with no other, and I mention it to promote the inquiry. The ten sorts in the Periplus are, 1. Moo-vXXiTixvj. Mosyllitick. P. So called from the port Mosyllon 3S, where it was obtained by the Greeks from Egypt, and whither they always resorted, from their first passing the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. It was the casia fistula ; the same as we now have from Ceylon, and imported at Mosyllon directly from India, or from the Arabian marts on the ocean, which were rivals of the Sabeans. It is mentioned by several authors as the best sort, or inferior only to zigeir, and therefore could not be native : there is indeed cinnamon on the coast of Africa, but it is hard, woody 39, and of little flavour. The regio cinnamomifera of Ptolemy bears no other sort but this : he places this tract at the boundary of his knowledge, that is, between Melinda and Mosambique ; and if it is in any way entitled to the name, it cannot be from its own produce, but on account of the importation of the spice from India; the traders who found it there, might suppose it native, in the same manner as the early writers speak of the Mbsyllitic, and which (as has been already noticed) Pliny first mentions as imported. The Mosyllitic species is rarely called 38 Bruce says it grew in the neighbourhood American, I have seen in the collection of of Aromata, and does still grow in the moun- Dr. Burgess ; and an African species, which tains and the plains ; that on the plains per- is not a bark, but a mere stick, with little haps equal to that of Ceylon.

The casia, or modern cinnamon, was found formerly in Java, Sumatra, and the coast of Malabar; from she coast of Malabar it found its way to Africa and Arabia; but when the Dutch were masters of Cochin41, they destnyyed all the plants on the coast, in order to secure the monopoly, to Ceylon ; and none is now met with on the coast, but an inferior wild sort, used by the natives, and brought sometimes to Europe for.the purpose of adulteration. 2. r/^6^, Ztyu(>, Tlt,t.

These planta tions, besides their convenience, are so thriving, that the practice is likely to be continued.

I have only to add, that the Sanskreet names of this spice are Savernaca and Ourana, as I learn from the Asiatick Researches, vol. iv. p. 235. ; and that Salmasius mentions Salihaca as the Arabic appellation, which he derives from the Greek EuXixvj, lignea, or woody (p. 1306.), but which, if I did not pay great respect to his authority, I should rather derive from Salikk, the Greek name of the island in the age of Ptolemy. \u2014 I have now thing appears in his work to add much to the observations here collected. \"5 See Knox's History of Ceylon, p. 16. 46 Bald\u00e6us mentions curendo-potto curendo gas, (p. 822.

Its value is sixteen denarii49, about twelve shillings and eight pence a pound. \u2014 Thus having discussed the costos or root, he proceeds to the leaf or plant : De folio nardi plura dici par est ; but of this hereafter. It is here only mentioned to give the true meaning of the passage. This root is said, by Salmasius, to grow in x'lrabia as well as India; and I do not find that it has acquired any European name, though it was formerly much used in medicine, and called the Arabian, or true costus. It is confounded by Go thofred, first with cosfamomum, which he derives from Mount Amanus, and secondly, with cardamomum. (See Salm. p. 400. & seqq.) I have supposed that amomum, as it is found in cinn-amomum, carda-momum, and cost-amomum, implies the warmth and gentle pungency of an aromatic ; for the amo mum itself, if we know what it is, is of a hot, spicy, pungent taste. (Chambers's Diet, in voce.) But Salmasius and Hoff man seem to trace it to a Greek origin (a^ai^, inculpatus), and to signify unadulterated. They apply it likewise to momia or mumia, because the amomum was particularly used to pre serve the body from putrefaction. It was found in India and Syria, but the best in Arabia (imported ?), The Arabian is white, sweet, light of weight, and fragrant; the Syrian is heavier, pale, and strong scented.

All this seems to confirm the opinion that it was porcelane procurable in India at that time, as it now is ; and that it was brought into Egypt by the ships that went to India. But what is more extraordinary is, that it was imitated in the manufactories of Diospolis in Egypt, just as our European porcelane is now formed upon the pattern of the Chinese. But in opposition to this opinion, Mr. Dutens, under the article Sardonyx, supposes that stone employed and cut, to form the Murrhina, on account of its beauty, and the great number of strata in a small compass ; that the Sardonyx was formed into small vases, as well as various sorts of agates, there can be little doubt; but why after cutting, it should lose the name of sardonyx, and take that of murrhina, is still to be ex plained ; and how they should be baked in Parthian furnaces, or imitated at Diospolis, must likewise be inquired. The best argument in favour of Mr. Dutens' opinion is, the connecting it with dnux^v in the invoice of the Peri pi As, A&U omy^vn *\u00ab* Mra/y*, and Lampridius likewise says of Heliogabalus, as cited 4z 2"], [784, "APPENDIX, 724 by Gesner, inyrrhinis et onychinis minxit. These instances are so strong, that if the other qualities attributed to this precious com modity could be accounted for, and rendered consistent, the suf frage of a writer so intelligent and well informed ought to prevail. Gesner produces a variety of authorities from Jo. Frid. Chris tius, which confirm this opinion of Mr. Dutens, or at least prove it a fossil.

Its basis or petuntze mania."], [785, "APPENDIX. 725 porcelane, I will state my reason plainly, and leave the deter mination to those who are better informed. Porcelane, though it is factitious, and not a fossil, is com posed of two materials which are fossil, the petuntze and the clay. The former, the Chinese call the bones, and the latter the flesh. The place of petuntze is supplied, in our European imitations, by flints reduced to an impalpable powder; and the vitrifaction of the petuntze or the flints in the furnace, gives to porcelane that degree of translucency it possesses. The pe tuntze is supposed to be found of late in England. Now it is a well-known fact, that the ancient composition of porcelane in China was said to be prepared for the son by the father, and to lie buried for several years before it was ready for the fur nace, and the inferiority of the modern porcelane is thought, by the Chinese connoisseurs, to arise from the neglect of this practice.. May not this have given rise to the opinion that the murrhina were a fossil production ? Another consideration arises from the words employed by Pliny to express the murrhine vessels, which are capis and abacus, signifying, if Hardouin be correct, literally, the cup and saucer, and the capis, which was a vessel used in sacrifices, was re gularly a vas fictile. But the last circumstance I shall mention is, the size of that murrhine vessel mentioned by Pliny, which contained three pints (sextarios). Can it be supposed that a sardonyx was ever seen of this size ? he adds indeed afterwards, amplitudine nus quam parvos excedunt abacos, which, to make it consistent, must be qualified with the exception of the former vessel that contained three pints. He has other particulars which lead us"], [786, "A P P E N D I X. 726 again to porcelane, crassitudine raro quanta dictum est vasi potorio ; and in another passage, humorem, putant sub terra ealorc densari, which he certainly applies to the concoction of a fossil, but which bears no little resemblance to the maturing of the materials before mentioned. After all, if it was a gem, it is astonishing that the sardonyx should be mentioned by no ancient author, as appropriated to this purpose. If it was factitious, it is equally strange, that nothing stronger should appear on that side of the question, than the capis of Pliny. The distinction could not have been mistaken. The country he assigns to the production is Kar mania, in the kingdom of Parthia, and that it came from Par thia5* into Egypt, to the countries on the Mediterranean, and to Rome, seems evident from a variety of authorities ; and that it might well do, if we consider that Parthia communicated with India by means of the Persian Gulph, and possibly on the north with China\" itself, by means of the caravans. The men tion of Karmania by Pliny, as the country where the murrhina were obtained, favours the supposition of procuring these ves sels from India; for the communication of Karmania with Scindi and Guzerat is almost immediate, and certainly prior to the navigation from Egypt to that coast. But in Guzerat they were obtained, when the author of the PeriplAs was employed in that trade ; and their arrival at the market of Baroach, from s< The kingdom, not the province, as we place at some frontier, like that between the may see from a former citation noticing Kar- Russians and Chinese at Kiatcha, is evident mania. from Ptolemy, Pliny, and the Periplus.

The immense value of these vessels at Rome might well arise from their scarcity. They were first seen there in the triumphal procession of Pompey ; and it must be observed that Pompey returned from the shores of the Caspian Sea. They were after wards introduced into use at the tables of the great, but of a small size and capacity, as cups for drinking. Afterwards one which held three sextarii or pints, was sold for seventy talents56, and at length Nero gave three 57 hundred for a single vessel. The extravagance of the purchaser might, in this instance,, en hance the price, but the value of the article may be better estimated by the opinion of Augustus, who, upon the conquest of Egypt, selected out of all the spoils of Alexandria a single murrhine cup for his own use. Now, therefore, if the mur rhine was porcelane, it may be a piece of information ac ceptable to our fair countrywomen, to know that Cleopatra did not indeed sip her tea, but drink her Mareotick wine out of china. I have not been able to consult the work of Christius, but take the account of his argument from Gesner, and I refer the reader for further information to Gesner in voce, to Chambers's Dictionary, to Salmasius, Plin. Exercit. and to an express dis sertation in the Volumes of the Academy of Belles Lettres, which I have formerly seen, but have not now an opportunity of consulting. I recollect that it is in favour of the opinion, that murrina and porcelane are the same.

And if the writings attri buted to Orpheus be really the work of Pythagoras, or a Py thagorean, as Cicero supposes, De Nat. Deorum, the know ledge of this property is still very old.

Why glass was so late before it was introduced to the know ledge of the Greeks and Ptomans, or other nations on the Mediterranean, seems extraordinary: but de Neri (Art de la Verrerie, Paris, 1752) informs us, that glass is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and appears in the New only, in the epistles of St. Paul, St. James, and the Revelations ; that of the Greeks, Aristotle is the first who makes express mention of it, and assigns the reason why it is transparent, and why it will not bend, but in a dubious passage; in Rome it was but little known before the year 536, U. C. and was not applied to the use of windows till near the reign of Nero. Seneca, Ep. xc. This seems the more extraordinary as the art of making glass was known in Egypt in the earliest times.

Probably serpentine or h\u00e6matite, in the opinion of Dr. Burgess. Salmasius objects to Pliny for calling it opsidian, or saying it was discovered by Opsidius. In Greek it is always opsian, and is a green stone very dark, approaching to black. It was found in the islands of Ethiopia; and from taking a high polish was used by the emperor Domitian to face a portico, so that from the reflection he might discover if any one was approaching from behind. The opsidian stone, mentioned by Pliny, is very dark but translucent, and a factitious sort of it which he likewise no tices, seems very much to resemble the material of which our brown or red tea-pots are composed.

The specimens of this stone, which 1 have seen, are so dark that the green cast can only be discovered by holding them in a particular position. The closeness of their texture seems to admit of any degree of polish that the artist may be disposed to give them. The specimen which I saw was brought from Egypt by a Gentleman who had visited the country : it was esteemed such in Egypt, and acknowledged for opsian by several of the most 59 But he mentions it as a topaz, and says, blue, why not a turquoise ? which is still a there are topazes of two different colours ; if favourite stone in the East."], [793, "APPENDIX. 733 curious observers at Rome ; and it exactly answers the descrip tion of Isidorus, adduced by Hardouin on this passage : est autem, niger, interdum et virens, aliquando et translucidus, crassiore visu.

That opsian and opsidian have been con founded, or applied to different substances, may be allowed ; but the opsidian of Pliny came from \u00c6thiopia, and so did the opsian of the Peripl&s ; and whatever be the name, the same fossil seems to be intended. How it may be applied by others, concerns not the present question; and if the etymology be Greek (from o-mo^xi or d\\\\ng), it might be applied to any po lished stone which reflects images. It is used by Orpheus under i opallius, lin. 4. in what sense I pretend not to determine ; but his classing it under the opal, which is clouded, and specifying its pitchy colour (xAt inAvog Xt^^nov d\\\\nxvo1'o) and stone like appearance, petrified, as he supposed, from the exudation of the pine, makes me suppose it the same as Pliny describes, when he mentions the imitations of it and the stone itself: In genere vitri et obsidiana numerantur, ad similitudinem lapidis quem in \u00c6thiopia Obsidius invenit, nigerrimi coloris, aliquando et translucidi crassiore visu, atque in speculis parietum pro imagine umbras reddente. M. Dutens (p. 66.) says, it is a vol canic o-lass, such as is found about Mount Etna and Mount Vesuvius; but instead of solving the difficulty, a1:>out which* he says, so many learned men have disputed in vain, this only adds to it; for if it was found in Italy and Sicily, why should it be sought for in Ethiopia, almost at the mouth of the Red Sea, and imported from Egypt at a prodigious expence ? Lord Valentia, in a survey that he has lately made of the western. 3"], [794, "APPENDIX. 734 coast of the Red Sea, has found the bay to which the opsian stone is attributed, about eighty miles below Adooli ; and it is not impossible that some other publick spirited Englishman may visit it again, and determine what is the opsian stone, by some native mineral production still to be discovered on the spot. 56.

Betel. In order to avoid the confusion of ancient authors, we must consider this article under two heads : First, as an Unguent, Odour, or Perfume ; Secondly, as the Betel. First, as an unguent or perfume, it is certainly assumed by Horace : Coronatus nitentes Malobathro Syrio capillos. Hor. lib. ii. ode vii. 89. and bv Pliny61 when he makes it, with all the fragrant odours of the East, enter into the royal unguent of the kings of Persia; (Lib. xiii.. c. 2) And again (lib. xii. c. 12, or 26 Hardouin,) where he mentions the nard of Gaul, Crete, and Syria ; the last agreeing with the Syrian odour of Horace, and almost ascertaining the error of confounding spikenard with the betel. So likewise (lib. xii. c. 59-) Hard. Dat. et malobathron Syria ex qua exprimitur oleum ad unguenta ; but in the same chapter \" Pearls sold in India. for three times their weight of pure gold. Ar. Ind. c. viii. in sine. M It appears by Pliny, lib. xiii. c. 2. that almost all the fragrant odours of the East en tered into the composition of their unguents. In the royal Persian unguent no less than twenty-six odours are enumerated, and among them the malobathron, which is not so pro perly an odour as a stimulant, if it be the betre. But it is frequently confounded with the spikenard, the first of odours, which is pre eminently called folium, or the leaf, in oppo sition to costus, or the root. But the arecka-nut being wrapt in the betel leaf has probably given rise to the mistake. See Pliny, lib. xii. c. 12. where the hadrosph\u00e6rum, mesosplif rum, microsph\u00e6rum \u2014 all distinctions of the betel, are falsely applied to the spikenard."], [796, "APPENDIX; 736 he says, sapor ejus nardo similis esse debet sub lingua ; and (lib. xxiii. c. 4S. Hard.) oris et halitus suavitatem commendat lin guae subditum folium : in which sense, as Dioscorides also tes tifies, it is a masticatory, and not an unguent. Added to this, he applies the titular distinction of hadrosph\u00e6rum, mesosph\u00e6rum, and microsph\u00e6rum to the spikenard (lib. xii. 26. Flard.) which Salmasius, Matthioli, and almost all the commentators, agree in assigning specifically to the betel ; and to the betel, betre, or petros, they are applied in. the Periplus. (p. penult.) The error of Pliny, and his fluctuation in making it both an unguent and a masticatory, arises from his considering the spikenard to be the leaf, xxt l^o^h (which it is not, but a root), and not con sidering, or not knowing, that the betel is, above all others, the leaf, used with the areka-nut, and the constant masticatory of the Orientals from Malabar to Japan. Secondly, that it is a masticatory is confirmed by Diosco rides ; for he says {y-n-OT^irxt ds ttj yXucrcryj ir^dg euudi'xv g-dpctreg), it is placed under the tongue to sweeten the breath, and it has (dvvx/xtii tIvx lig-ofixx^Ti^xv) the virtue of strengthening the stomach. If any native of the East were at this day asked the properties of betel, no doubt he would specify these two particulars above all others. But it should seem that Disoscorides was aware of the confusion caused by mistaking the nard for the betel ; for he commences his account by saying, that some believe the mala bathrum to be the leaf of the nard, deceived by the similarity of the odour; but the fact is far otherwise. (See Matthioli, p. 40.) The author of the Periplus knew that Petros was the leaf, and that when the whole composition was made up together, it was called Malabathrum; for he mentions the method of"], [797, "APPENDIX. 737 obtaining it by the Seres from the Sesat\u00e6, and their exporta tion of it again, (p. ult.) We know likewise that the procuring it at the extremity of the East, is consonant to modern observa tion ; for though it is used in India, it is indispensable in all ceremonies in Ava, Pegu, China, and the islands of Java, Su matra, &c. It is now well known to consist of the areka-nut, the betel-leaf, a mixture of lime from sea-shells, and some times with the addition of odoriferous drugs. The areka-nut has the appearance of an oblate nutmeg, hard as horn, and when cut, resembling the nutmeg in its mottled appearance. Dr. Burgess informs me, that the unripe nutmeg is sometimes pressed, and an aromatic liquid procured, fragrant in the highest degree, which perhaps may have some relation to the perfumed unguent of the ancients. The betel is a species of the pepper-plant, and the lime is called chinam, the use of which turns the teeth black ; and black teeth consequently, from the universality of the practice, are the standard of ele o-ance in all those countries where the usage prevails. For the natural history of the ingredients, and the ceremonies attending the custom, I refer to Sir G. Staunton's Chinese Embassy, vol. i. 272. ; Mr. Marsden's Sumatra, p. 242. ; and Mr. Tur ner's Embassy to Thibet, pp. 285. 343. The name of this masticatory varies in different countries, but its Arabick name is Tembul, Tembal, or Tambal ; and from tamala, added to betro or bathra, tamala-bathra is derived, and the mala-bathra of the ancients, according to the opinion of Salmasius. \u2014 \" But Stephens (in voce) gives a different etymo \" loo-y : Ferunt apud Indos nasci in ea regione qu\u00e6 Malabar \" dicitur, vernacula ipsorum lingua.

Folium Barbaricum, spikenard ; but the third is the Clove, and is not related to the other two folia or leaves, unless it were introduced into the rescript of the Digest, from the custom house at Alexandria, because it was a compound of ctvXXov, a leaf. Caruo-phullon, the nut leaf, is a name applied to the pink flower, because the sheath which encloses the flower is scolloped and jagged like, the sheath of a nut. Whether this was transferred to the clove itself, on account of the angular points at the head of the close, or nail ; or whether to the plant, I am not able to determine.

Their account is contained in the fourth volume of the Asiatic Researches, and Dr. Roxburgh was so fortunate at last as to obtain the plant in a state of perfection, of which he has given a drawing that puts an end to all controversy on the subject. The nard has the addition of spike from the Latin spica, an ear of wheat, which, according to Drj Roxburgh's drawing, it perfectly resembles. And this adjunct is found also in its Arabic name, sumbul ; and in its Shanskreet appellation, Jata mansi; as also its Persic title khustah, all signifying spica. Sir William Jones, Asiat. Res. iv. 1 17. says, it is a native of Budtan, Nepal, and Morang ; and that it is a species of Va lerian. It is remarkable that he had himself seen a resem blance of it in Syria, as the Romans or Greeks mention Syria as one of the countries where it is found ; but Ptolemy gives it its true origin in these tracts of India, A specimen was brought down to Calcutta from Boudtan, at the request of Sir William Jones, and the agents of the Deva Raja called it pampi ; but it was not in flower. Some dried specimens of it looked like the tails of ermines, but the living ones, as Dr. Roxburgh afterwards found, rise from the ground like ears of wheat. It answers the description of Dioscorides. It is weaker in scent than the Sumbul spikenard of Lower Asia when dry, and even lost much of its odour between Boudtan and Calcutta. The odour is like the scent of violets; but the living plant is for bidden to be brought out of Boudtan. It was, however, pro cured by the intervention of Mr. Purling, the English resident; and was at last received in its perfect form by Dr. Roxburgh, who has described it botanically. As. Res. iv. 733."], [805, "APPENDIX 745 In the age of the Periplus it was brought from Scindi, and from the Ganges ; which, according to Sir William Jones, we ought to conclude would be the natural port for it, as coming from Boudtan. This authorizes the change of reading from yx7rxviKy [gapanika,] to yxyyirixyj, [gangitika,] more especially as it is mentioned at the Ganges, and the most fanciful in quirer would hardly refer Gapanika to Japan. Other particulars occur in Pliny which are worthy of re mark ; for he' describes the nard with its spica, mentioning also that both the leaves and the spica are of high value, and that the odour is the prime in all unguents. The price an hundred denarii for a pound. But he afterwards visibly con founds it with the malobathrum or betel, as will appear from his usage of hadrosph\u00e6rum, mesosph\u00e6rum, microsph\u00e6rum, terms peculiar to the betel. Hoffman in voce Foliatum, writes, Folium catasph\u00e6rum est Folium Malabathri quod inde <r\u00a7x^xt, i. e. pilul\u00e6 conficerentur. Folium vero Barbaricum, id quod Indicum, Gr\u00e6ci recentiores nominarunt quod ex India deferretur per Barbaricum Sinum. F. F. -But it is not the Barbaricus Sinus on the coast of Africa that is meant, but the port Barbarike in the Delta of the Indus. There the Periplus finds the spikenard, which is the folium Indicum. Folium catasph\u00e6rum, hadrosph\u00e6rum, &c. is the betel-leaf. Hoffman adopts Salmasius's opinion in regard to the mistake of Pliny : he seems to think that the maloba thrum, as well as the folium, was confounded with the spike nard. If so, the malobathrum Syrium of Horace is the un guent of spikenard, which, according to Sir W. Jones, is found in Syria as well as in India. 5c VOL. II."], [806, "N APPENDIX. 746 The characteristic name of the nard is folium68, the leaf, pre-eminently in contradistinction to costus, the root, both as the prime odours of their two sorts, the root and the leaf. Dr. Falconer has justly cautioned me to be sure that the nard of Pliny is the leaf. I know no more of natural history than I have obtained from the authorities here cited ; but that Pliny mentions both the spica and the folium of the nard, is certain ; and by his expressions I understand, that what we now know to be the root, he supposed to be the growth. Cacumina in aristas se spargunt, assuredly expresses something above ground ; ideo g\u00a9mina dote nardi spicas ac folia celebrant, as evidently ex presses that spic\u00e6 and folia are parts of the nard. But that Pliny was mistaken, and that the spica was really the root, cannot be doubted, after the account that Dr. Roxburgh has given. It is clear also from the authorities adduced by Dr. F. that the ancients were well informed of this. \" In one of the \" receipts for the Theriaca Andromachi, Na^mo ts \\gm Ivdyg.

Add to this the testimony of Dr. Roxburgh, and it will appear evidently that Pliny was mistaken. Another medical friend informs me, \" that the matted fibres, which are the part chosen for medi \" cinal purposes, are supposed by some to be the head, or \" spike of the plant, by others, the root \u2014 they seem rather to \" be the remains of the withered stalks, or ribs of the leaves ; \" sometimes entire leaves and pieces of stalks are found among \" them.\" Is not this the origin of Pliny's mistake, which Dr. Roxburgh sets at rest ? and may not these leaves and stalks be purposely left to increase the weight and price ; or even to de ceive, as the natives are so jealous of their plant ? All this accords with the quotation of Dr. F. from Bod\u00e6us. But there is still a more remarkable particular in Pliny, which is, that he manifestly copies the Periplus in the three places which he allots for the markets of the spikenard ; for he men tions Patala at the head of the Delta67 in Scindi, corre spondent to the Barbarika of the Penpl&s ; and another sort which he calls Oz\u00e6nitides, evidently agreeing with the mart of Ozene (p. 27, Peripl.) ; and a third sort named Gangitic, from the Ganges, answering to gapanic, for which all the com mentators agree in reading Gangitic.

Mr. Falconer imagines it to magnify only from the density of the medium. Mr. Dutens denies that the ancients had- any knowledge of the emerald, and in this he is supported by Tavernier, the Abbe Raynal, Harris, and Bruce. The green gems which the ancients called emeralds, were all of in ferior quality to those brought from Brasil and Peru ; and from the size mentioned of some of them, they are justly supposed to be Fluors; but we read of an emerald island in the Red Sea, and much notice is taken of them, both by naturalists and poets. The greatest difficulty to be surmounted by Mr. Dutens seems to be the archbishop of York's emerald, engraved with a Medusa's head of Grecian sculpture, and brought from Benares ; but this, he calls a green ruby, p. 14. See Bruce, i. 206. who says, Theophrastus mentions an emerald of four cubits, and a pyramid sixty feet high, composed of four emeralds. And Roderick of Toledo talks of an emerald table in Spain 547 feet long ! But Bruce says, likewise, the true emerald is as hard as the ruby. How then are we to distin guish between an emerald and a green ruby ? Bruce visited the Emerald Island in the Red Sea, and found nothing more like emeralds than a green chrystalline substance, little harder than glass; and this, he adds, is found equally on the con tinent and the island. Emeralds have been found in Peru, in the barrows of the dead, of a cylindrical form; so that the Peruvians, anciently, must not only have known the gem, but valued it; and must also have possessed the art of cutting it. Ulloa. Mr. Falconer has suggested to me a singular passage in Pliny, which may be applied to Nero's emerald, and which"], [821, "APPENDIX. 761 had escaped my notice : Iidem plerumque et concavi ut visum colligant. Plin. lib. xxxvii. c. 5. or 16 Hard. ; so that the emerald mentioned in this instance might truly be considered as an eye-glass for a short sight. F. The whole chapter is so very express, that it is hard to conceive what is an emerald, if Pliny's is not: Scythicorum \u00c6gyptiorumque tanta est duritia ut vulnerari nequeant. This seems to express that hardness which the jewellers try by the file. 106. Spvpet. Myrrh. D. P. Mor, Arabick.

Salmasius adds, that the Oriental name of the Ruby is Yacut from Hyacinthus; but Dutens says the hya cinth is orange Aurora, inclining to poppy, p. 35. and makes the Jacinth a distinct gem from the Ruby ; but the Ruby, he observes, likewise, is of a poppy colour, and is called Hya cinth when it has the least tincture of yellow. Whether this distinction applies to the ancients, I am not a judge to deter mine ; but if the hyacinth is a distinct species, I can find no classical name for the ruby. See Pliny, xxxvii. 9- or 41.

Hopia Indica adserta, opera Indica adserta, omnia Indica adserta, and again opera Indica, tincta, adtincta, &c. &c. ; but if we accede to Salmasius in regard to the two species of Chelone, and place the period at Indica ; adserta may be another general title like several in the Digest, and easily con verted into Serica, it would then stand thus : Serica, - - general title, silk Metaxa, - - 1st species, - silk thread. Vestis Serica, - 2d species, - silk web. Nema Sericum, - 3d species, - sewing silk. The only objection to this is, that Metaxa and Nema Sericum are usually applied to the same thing.
