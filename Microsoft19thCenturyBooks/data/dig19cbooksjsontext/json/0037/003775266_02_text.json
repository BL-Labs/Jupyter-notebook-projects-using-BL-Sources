'DEATH BRINGS COOL NIGHT AFTER LIFE'S SULTRY DAY/ Monday morning was bleak and cold. There was neither frost nor snow, but a driving rain that beat fiercely upon all the southern windows of the Water House, and obscured the view of river and vdlage, church tower and moorland. At nine o'clock Beatrix was still sleeping. Bella, to whom necessity had given the habit of early rising, was dressed and out of her room before eight, and found herself at a loss for occupation. There was a cheery fire in Miss Harefield's sitting- VOL. II. B"], [10, "2 AN OPEN VERDICT. room, and the breakfast was laid \u2014 a snug round table bright with pretty china and quaint old silver, with an old blue and red Oriental bowl of hothouse flowers in the centre. How different from the Scratchell table, with its tumbled week-old cloth, which was like an enlarged copy of Mercator's Chart of the World, done in tea and coffee \u2014 its odds and ends of crockery, all cracked \u2014 for what pottery that ever the potter moulded could withstand the destructiveness of the young Scratchells . \u2014 the bat tered old Britannia teapot, stale quartern loaf, scanty remnant of salt butter, and inadequate dish of pale-faced rashers, the distribution of which half cured pig gave rise to much ill-will and recrimina tion among Mr. Scratchell's olive branches ! At home Bella would have had to help in the preparation of the morning meal, and to assist her overworked mother in the struggle to preserve peace and order while it was being eaten. Here she had nothing to do but to sit and watch the logs burning, and listen to the clock ticking and the rain lashing the windows, while she waited for Beatrix. This state of existence, placid though it was"], [11, "DEATH BRINGS COOL NIGHT.' 3 as compared with the turmod of home, soon began to pall upon BeUa, who was of an essentially active temper. She went to the window and looked out, but could see only dim shapes- of mountain and moor through the blinding rain. She thought of Cyril Culverhouse, who was going his rounds already, perhaps, in the cold and rain, or teaching damp chddren in a windy schoolroom. She thought of her poor mother, whose much-tried spirit was doubtless being exercised by the tea kettle's obstinate persistence in not boiling, and of her father, who was most likely making himself an affliction to everybody with his weU-known Monday morning temper. To-morrow would be Christmas Day. This afternoon Miss Harefield's presents, and Bella's poor little offerings were to be sent to the ScratcheUs. BeUa wondered whether her father would be molli fied in temper as evening wore round so far as to aUow of egg-flip or snapdragon \u2014 those luxuries for which the young ScratcheUs always pleaded, but wherewith they were but seldom gratified. Yet, by and by, when going down the hdl of life, they"], [12, "4 AN OPEN VERDICT. would look back fondly upon this arid chddhood, and, softened by distance, the rare and scanty pleasures of these early days would seem to them sweeter than anything which a prosperous later life could yield. The clock struck the quarter after nine, and stiU Bella sat looking at the fire, with the breakfast table undisturbed. Even the urn had left off hissing. Beatrix was not generaUy so late. The two girls had been accustomed to sit down together at eight, for in Miss Scales' moral code late hours were sinful, and a nine o'clock breakfast was the first stage in a downward career. BeUa's patience was exhausted. She went to Beatrix's door and knocked. No answer. She knocked louder, and called, and stdl there was no answer. She was beginning to feel uneasy, when she saw the young woman who waited on Miss Harefield coming along the corridor. ' Is your mistress up, Mary ? Have you done her hair ? ' ' No, miss. I went at half -past seven, as usual, but she was sleeping so sound I didn't like to wake"], [13, "' DEATH BRINGS COOL NIGHT.' 5 her. I know she has had bad nights lately, and I thought the sleep would do her good. I've been on the listen for her beU ever since.' ' And she has not rung ? ' ' No, miss.' BeUa went in without another word. Beatrix was sleeping profoundly. 'Don't wake her, miss/ said the maid, looking in at the door. ' She's been wanting sleep aU along. Mr. Namby says so. Let her have her sleep out/ ' Very weU,' assented Bella. ' I'U go and have my breakfast. I'm quite exhausted with wait- ing/ 'So you must be, miss, and the urn is cold and the eggs too, I'U lay. I'U go and get things hotted up for you.' BeUa sat down to her lonely breakfast, presently, profound silence reigning in the house, and a dul ness as of the grave. She began to think that, after all, wealth was not an unqualified blessing. Here was the heiress to one of the finest estates in York shire, with innumerable acres in Lincolnshire to boot, leading an existence so joyless and monotonous"], [14, "6 AN OPEN VERDICT. that even one week of it was too much for Miss Scratch eU. And yonder at the Park the wife of a millionaire was hastening her descent to the grave by vain cares and needless economies. Tlie rich people did not seem, according to BeUa's small ex perience, to get value for their money. She was still sitting at breakfast when she was surprised by a visit from the butler. ' Oh, if you please, ma'am/ he began, with a serious ah, ' Mrs. Peters and I are rather anxious about Mr. Harefield. We reaUy don't feel to know what we ought to do \u2014 the circumstances are alto gether out of the way. I don't want to do more than my duty as a faithful servant \u2014 and I shouldn't feel satisfied if I was to do less/ ' But what is wrong ? ' asked Bella, puzzled and scared by this circumlocution, and now perceiving the round rubicund visage of the housekeeper look ing in at the door. ' Is Mr. Harefield ill ? ' ' No, Miss Scratchell, it isn't that \u2014 but we cannot find him.' ' You can't find him ? ' 'No, ma'am. He isn't in his bedroom, and"], [15, "'DEATH BRINGS COOL NIGHT.' 7 what's more, his bed wasn't slept in last night. He isn't in the library or the dining-room, and those three rooms are the only ones he ever uses. His habits, as you know, ma'am, are as regular as clockwork, as far as regards meals and so on. He takes his breakfast at nine o'clock, and goes from his breakfast to his library. He never left home in his hfe without letting me know beforehand. But he didn't sleep in this house last night, and he's not to be found in this house this morning.' 'He may have gone away last night with that strange gentleman,' suggested Bella. ' No, ma'am, that he didn't, for I let the foreign gentleman out, and locked the door after him.' ' Have you searched the house ? Mr. Harefield may have faUen down in a fit somewhere. It's too dreadful to think of.' ' I've looked everywhere that was hkely. There are only three rooms that he ever uses, as I said, ma'am. And I wouldn't frighten Miss Harefield for the world. That's why I came to consult you, ma'am, knowing you to be a clever young lady, and your father being my master's lawyer.'"], [16, "8 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' Come/ said BeUa, seeing the two servants looking at her, as if for inspiration. ' If Mr. Hare field has gone away on the spur of the moment, I dare say he has left a letter or a memorandum somewhere. Let us go round the house together, and look about. It was quite right of you not to disturb Miss Harefield.' BeUa led the way downstairs, followed by the two scared servants. Her heart was beating fast, agitated by nameless fears; but even in the midst of her fear she felt a kind of elation, a sense of new importance. Some great event was going to happen. This slow old ship, the Water House, was entering stormy seas, and she was at the helm. A sudden thought went through her heart hke a knife. What if Mr. Harefield were to die ? His death would mean wealth and freedom, love, liberty, aU glad things that earth could give for Beatrix. It would mean union with Cyril Culverhouse. The pang of envy which pierced Bella's little soul at that thought was an almost insupportable agony. She had endured the idea of their mutual love"], [17, "'DEATH BRINGS COOL NIGHT.' 9 with secret pangs and heart-burnings, but with at least an outward patience, whde aU possibility of their union was afar off. But, to see them pros perous lovers, happy in each other; to hear their wedding bells, and to have to sit by and smile assenthigly while her little world praised them and rejoiced in their happiness, would be too much. AU these considerations passed through her mind as she went downstairs, with the housekeeper and butler behind her, on her way to the library, where, if any letter had been left by Mr. Hare field before his departure, it was most likely to be found. The shutters had been opened and the blinds drawn up, the fire was lighted, the chairs were set straight. But the large writing-table, with its litter of books and papers, had been left untouched. The housemaids at the Water House knew their duties too weU to disturb anything there. There were letters on the mantelpiece, old letters thrust carelessly behind bronze candle sticks and Oriental jars. The butler went over to"], [18, "10 AN OPEN VERDICT. the hearth to examine these papers, with a faint hope that there might be a message from his missing master among them. The housekeeper went to look at a tray in the hall, where cards and letters were sometimes put, and where it was just possible her master might have left some message on a scrap of paper. BeUa turned over the books on the table \u2014 a volume of Euripides, the last number of the West minster, half a dozen pamphlets, political and scien tific. She started, and looked at the butler, who was standing with his back to her, deliberately sorting the letters he had taken from the mantel piece, chiefly receipted accounts which his master had thrust there and forgotten, Christian Harefield not being a man of business-like habits, or given to the docketing and pigeon-holing of unimportant papers. Here, under BeUa ScratcheU's hand, lying half hidden among the books and pamphlets, was a letter that evidently meant something. A large blue envelope, sealed with the Harefield crest, and curiously addressed, \u2014"], [19, "'DEATH BRINGS COOL NIGHT.' 11 'For my daughter Beatrix.' A man would hardly write to his daughter, she living under the same roof with him, sitting at meat with him a few hours ago, unless he had something of an exceptional nature to teU her. These considerations and some more passed through Bella's mind as she stood with her hand on the letter, her eyes on the butler's portly back. He was entirely engrossed with his scrutiny of the envelopes in his hand, being of a slow and stolid temperament, and requiring leisure in which to grasp an idea. At this moment no one but BeUa and the writer knew of the existence of this letter. And the writer, where was he ? BeUa put the letter into her pocket. \"I wdl give it to her myself,' she thought. 'It wUl be better/ ' There's nothing here, Miss Scratchell/ said the butler, 'and this is where master always puts his letters for the post.' And then he came and surveyed the table with his slow gaze, which seemed feebly to interrogate"], [20, "12 AN OPEN VERDICT. the covers of the books, as if in the hope that they might tell him something. ' Nothing on the table, ma'am ? ' 'Nothing/ answered BeUa. 'It's a very awkward position for old servants to find themselves placed in/ said the butler ' It isn't like my master to go out of the house and teU nobody, and leave his servants to puzzle and worry themselves about him. He has been eccen tric of late years, but always the gentleman. And how could he go away, except on foot, which isn't likely ? I've been to the stables. He has not been out there. The horses are in their staUs. There's no coach goes through Little Yafford. There's no rail within five mdes.' 'I wish 1 knew what to advise you,' said BeUa, 'but indeed I do not. It's quite a dreadful situation for you to be in. And Miss Harefield wdl be coming downstairs presently, and must be told. I really think you ought to send for my father. He would know what to do, perhaps/ ' I couldn't take upon myself to do such a thing, ma'am. If my master should come back, and be offended at us making such a fuss '"], [21, "13 'DEATH BRINGS COOL NIGHT.' ' But you have a right to make a fuss. His bed was not slept in last night, you say. He disappears suddenly on a Sunday night, after receiving a mys terious visitor. You have a right to be frightened/ ' Why frightened ? Who has disappeared ? ' asked a voice at the door, and Beatrix entered, pallid and heavy eyed after her late slumbers. ' Oh, Beatrix/ cried Bella, going over to her, ' I did not think you were coming downstairs.' ' What is wrong . ' asked Beatrix. ' Is it any thing about my father ? ' There was a pause, and then she turned sharply upon the butler. ' There is something wrong/ she said, ' and you are trying to hide it from me. Is my father dl?' Peacock faltered, stammered, and finally ex plained the state of things. ' When did you last see papa ? ' asked Beatrix, after he had finished. ' It was half-past ten o'clock, ma'am. I brought wood and coals, and asked if there was anything more wanted, and my master said no.' ' Was he looking ill \u2014 or agitated ? '"], [22, "14 AN OPEN VERDICT. 'I did not notice anything particular. He was sitting quietly before the fire.' ' Beading ? ' ' No. He was not reading.' Beatrix sank into her father's chair, very pale, and trembling in every limb. She could think of nothing \u2014 she could suggest nothing. For the moment tlie very power of thought seemed suspended, but this state of mental coUapse did not last long. Bella leant over her and murmured something indistinctly soothing. Beatrix rose and went quickly to the door. 'Let us look in every room in the house/ she said. ' In my mother's rooms first of aU. He may be there/ ' Oh, Miss Beatrix ! ' cried Peacock, ' why, you know those rooms are never opened.' ' Yes, sometimes by him. He keeps the key\" The visitor last night was an old friend of my mother's. The sight of him might bring back thoughts of the past to my father.' She ran quickly up stairs, and to the passage out of 'which her mother's rooms opened. It was at"], [23, "'DEATH BRINGS COOL NIGHT. 15 the end of the house opposite that in Avhich Beatrix lived. ' See/ she cried, ' the key is in the door of the morning-room. My father is there/ She knocked softly, and waited for a minute or so, but there was no answer. Then she took courage and went in alone ; whde Peacock, and the house keeper, and Miss Scratchell waited breathlessly in the corridor. There was a pause, which to these listeners seemed long, and then there rose a cry that thrdled them. They went in all together, full of fear, and found Beatrix Harefield on her knees beside a sofa, on which, stretched at full length, clad in its monk's robe of gray cloth, lay that which a few hours ago had been the master of all things on the Water House estate, ruler of many lives, by the sublime right of ten thousand a year. Send some one for Mr. Namby,' cried Pea- cock. ' Come away with me, Miss Beatrix, love/ cried the housekeeper. ' You can't do any good, and you'll"], [24, "16 AN OPEN VERDICT. only make yourself unhappy. Come away with me and Miss Scratchell.' Bella stood looking on, white and scared, and said not a word. Beatrix heard good Mrs. Peters' entreaties, but took no heed. She was stiU upon her knees, clasping a dead man's icy hand, and all the life within her seemed frozen like his."], [25, "> CHAPTER II. 'DUST AND AN ENDLESS DARKNESS.' The church clock struck twelve, and, as the last stroke died into silence, Little Yafford school-house discharged a torrent of children into the rainy street, boys in red comforters, girls in blue comforters, com forters of the three primary colours and all their secondaries. Overcoats and cloaks were scarce at Little Yafford, and the worsted comforter was the chief winter clothing. ' Rain, rain, go away, come again another day/ shrieked the children, making a choral appeal to the clerk of the weather. Aud they went whooping down the street, spin ning tops, flying shuttlecocks,? as if the rain were rather agreeable than otherwise. Cyril Culverhouse came out of the school-house, unfurling his well-worn umbrella. He had been holding an examination of the scholars at the end VOL. H. c"], [26, "18 AN OPEN VERDICT. of the year, and was disheartened at finding some of them woefully ignorant, despite the pains he had taken with both pupds and teachers during the last twelve months. It was uphill work. He found the children's minds fairly stored with a collection of hard facts. They knew all about the deluge, and the passage of the Red Sea. They could tell him the names of the prophets, and were as familiar with Daniel and Jonah as if the adventures of those holy men had been events of the last year; but of spiritual things, of the principles and meaning of their religion, they had hardly an idea. Here all was dark. They were Christians because they had been signed with the sign of the Cross, and sprinkled with holy water by the parson. Their catechisms told them aU about that. But what Christianity meant, with its Divine law of love, justice, and mercy, they knew nothing. Mr. Culverhouse sighed as he opened his um brella and went out into the cold and rain. This Christmastide did not come upon him as a particu larly happy season \u2014 save in its purely spiritual aspect. He was full of anxiety about Beatrix. It was hard"], [27, "' DUST AND AN ENDLESS DARKNESS.' 19 to live so near her, and yet not dare to approach her. He had seen her in church every Sunday morning, and had seen her looking ill and worn. He knew that she was unhappy, and without a friend except Bella Scratchell. What a dismal season Christmas must seem for her, poor chdd ! How cruel a mockery the joy-bells, and hoUy boughs, and outward sem blance of festivity ! His business to-day took him the direction of the bridge. He could see the Water House on the other side of the river, its gray walls and ivy covered entrance tower looming darkly through a mist of rain. Who was this approaching him along the muddy road, struggling manfully against wind and rain? Cyrd could see nothing but a pair of pepper and salt legs under a gingham umbrella. The pepper and salt legs brought the umbrella nearer him. It was an umbreUa with a slippery brass handle, and altogether an affliction to its possessor. A sudden gust blew it on one side, and revealed the countenance of Mr. Namby, pale and agitated. 'How d'ye do, Namby?' said Cyril, with no"], [28, "20 AN OPEN VERDICT. intention of saying more, for the vdlage surgeon was a talkative little man, and the busy curate had no time to waste upon gossip. But Mr. Namby made a dead stop. 'Oh, Mr. Culverhouse, I have just come from the Water House.' Tins was enough to bring Cyril to a standstdl also. 'There is awful trouble there.' ' Good heavens ! What trouble ? Is Miss Hare field dl?' ' Poor child ! She is in a dreadful state. Her father is dead.' Cyrd felt as if his heart had stopped beating. The rainy landscape rocked before his eyes, the muddy road reeled beneath his feet. ' Dead ! ' he gasped. 'Dead, suddenly. And I'm afraid by poison; 'What!' cried Cyrd. 'You must be mad to say such a thing.' 'It wdl be for the coroner to decide; there will be an inquest, of course. But I have no doubt as to the cause of death. There are all the symptoms of poisoning by opium/"], [29, "' DUST AND AN ENDLESS DARKNESS.' 21 'Good God! Was he in the habit of taking opium ? ' ' Not to my knowledge/ 'But he surely must have been. How else should he come by his death ? It must have been an over dose of opium.' 'I never heard him complain of acute pain. He had an hon constitution. He had no reason for taking opium that I can see/ 'No reason! Look at the men who take it without reason, for the pleasure of taking it. Look at Coleridge \u2014 De Quincey. Mr. Harefield was just the kind of man to be an opium-eater. That would account for his hermit-like life exist ence \u2014 his seclusion from aU the world. He had a world of his own \u2014 he had the opium-eater's paradise/ 'It is possible/ said Mr. Namby, doubtfuUy. 'But it is strange that I should never have per ceived the symptoms. There are unmistakable indications in the appearance of the habitual opium-eater/ ' How often did you see Mr. Harefield ? '"], [30, "22 AN OPEN VERDICT. Not very often, I confess.' ' Not often enough for your observations of him to be worth much. Dead! It is very awful. When did it happen ? ' Mr. Namby proceeded to relate all he had heard at the Water House ; and for once in his life he found Cyril Culverhouse a patient listener. 'And Miss Harefield? How does she bear the shock ? ' ' She is very quiet. She seems stupefied. The whole thing was so sudden. She and Miss Scratchell dined with Mr. Harefield yesterday evening. There was nothing to show that he was ill or agitated, or in any way different from his usual self.' 'Who is with Miss Harefield?' ' Only Miss Scratchell and the servants. That excellent Miss Scales is away in Devonshire, with an ading relation ; but she is expected back daily/ ' She ought to be summoned at once. I'll call at the Vicarage and ask Mrs. Dulcimer to go to the Water House.'"], [31, "' DUST AND AN ENDLESS DARKNESS.' 23 He turned back with Mr. Namby, and they walked together towards the Vicarage, which was at the other end of the village street. Mr. Namby turned into his own garden gate, and left Cyril to go on alone to the Vicarage. Mr. Culverhouse had no exalted opinion of Mrs. Dulcimer's good sense, but he highly estimated her good nature, and he could think of no one better whose friendship he could appeal to on Beatrix Harefield's behalf. Mrs. Dulcimer was warmly attached to Beatrix. She would be over flowing with kindliness and sympathy in this hour of trouble. The Vicar was in his library, Mrs. Dulcimer in the dining-room with Rebecca, allotting little heaps of warm clothing as Christmas gifts for her poor parishioners. The dining-table was covered with neatly made flannels and linsey petticoats. Mrs. Dulcimer and Rebecca were folding and smoothing the little packages, and ' admiring their own work, for Rebecca's needle was as busy as her mistress's in this benevolent labour. Rebecca withdrew respectfully, at the curate's"], [32, "24 AN OPEN VERDICT. entrance, and Cyrd told Mrs. Dulcimer what had happened at the Water House. She interrupted him continually with questions and exclamations ; but he got through his story somehow. ' Poor dear child ! ' cried Mrs. Dulcimer, when she had heard all; 'coming into that fine estate; poor Mr. Harefield's mother was a Pynsent, you know, and all the Pynsent property goes with the Harefield estate, and under such shocking cir cumstances. What a pity she hasn't a husband to protect her interests ! I shouldn't wonder if the property were thrown into Chancery. If your cousin Kenrick had only been wise now ' ' What do you mean, Mrs. Dulcimer ? ' 'He might have been owner of the finest pro perty in the West Riding. He might have been Beatrix's husband by this time.' 'I think the lady would have been entitled to a voice in the matter/ said Cyrd, ' however wise my cousin Kenrick might have been.' ' Oh, nonsense, Cyril ! Such a young man as Kenrick might choose for himself. And in poor Beatrix's position she would naturally have re-"], [33, "'dust and an endless darkness/ 25 ciprocated his affection, if it had only been warmly offered.' ' I cannot agree with you there. But if you will go and see the poor girl ' ' I'll put on my bonnet this instant. Wdl you come with me, Cyril ? ' ' I think not, I should be of no use, ' Well, a man certainly is apt to be in the way under such circumstances. He never knows what to say, or what to leave unsaid/ 'And a woman never errs in leaving anything unsaid/ remarked the Vicar, entering through the curtained archway. While Mrs. Dulcimer was putting on her bonnet, Cyril told the Vicar what Mr. Namby had said about the cause of Christian Harefield's death, a detad which he had not communicated to Mrs. Dulcimer. ' This makes it a painful business/ said Cyrd. ' Very/ answered the Vicar. ' But I should not be surprised at Mr. Harefield having deliberately taken the dose that killed him.' 'Why not?'"], [34, "26 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' Because to my mind he was a likely subject for suicide. Look at the life he led. A man must sooner or later get tired of leading such a life. Some day he must say to himself, \" Wherefore, to what end do I live ? \" And then, if he is half an infidel, if religion exercises no restraining influence over his acts, he wdl make up his mind, suddenly, perhaps, to end his existence. He has no love of his feUow-men to anchor him to earth, no hope of anything bright or good waiting for him in the coming years. He has a very faint belief \u2014 possibly none at all \u2014 in a tribunal beyond this world where he wdl have to answer for his deeds. It is very clear to me that for the last ten years Cliristian Harefield's life has been burdened by some incur able sorrow. He may have grown weary of bearing the sorrow, as people grow weary of bearing pain.' ' You are probably right,' said Cyril ; ' yet I should rather believe his death accidental.' Mrs. Dulcimer went to the Water House, knowing no more than the fact of Mr. Harefield's sudden death and his daughter's desolation. She went up"], [35, "27 'DUST AND AN ENDLESS DARKNESS.' to Beatrix's room, expecting that the stricken girl would throw herself into her arms and pour out all her woes upon that friendly bosom. Mrs. Dulcimer's frdls and puffings and broad bonnet strings were in a flutter with the importance of her mission. She felt as if she were the young heiress's legal guardian. ' My dearest girl/ she cried, ' how my heart bleeds for you ! ' But Beatrix was in a curious mood. She seemed not to want other people's bleeding hearts. Indeed, her own heart was too deeply wounded to receive comfort from such sympathetic bleeding. Mrs. Dulcimer made all the customary speeches which are made and provided for such occasions. 'You must come to the Vicarage with me, my love/ she said. ' You must not stop in this dreary house.' But here Beatrix was firm. She would not leave the house in which her dead father was lying. ' We were not happy together while he was living/ she said, 'but I wiU not desert him now he is dead/"], [36, "28 AN OPEN VERDICT. And then she relapsed into a state of seeming apathy, from which Mrs. Dulcimer found it im possible to rouse her. BeUa was there, looking pale and scared, but ready to be useful if she were required. By and by, failing in aU attempts at consola tion, Mrs. Dulcimer went downstairs to talk this sad business over with the housekeeper and Mr. Scratchell, who had appeared upon the scene as legal representative of the deceased, and had already busied himself in a semi-official manner in locking up papers and setting seals on desks and cabinets in the library. From the butler and housekeeper Mrs. Dulcimer heard details which she had not heard from Cyril Culverhouse. She was told all about the mysteri ous visitor of the previous night. ' I believe he was one of Mrs. Harefield's Italian friends,' said the butler. ' There was some thing familiar about his face. I could as good as swear I've seen him times and often before last night/ 'As good as swearing won't do/ said Mr."], [37, "'DUST AND AN ENDLESS DARKNESS.' 29 Scratchell, with professional severity. 'Unless you are prepared to make a direct statement upon oath you had better say nothing, about your im pressions and recollections before the coroner by and by.' ' The coroner ! ' cried Mrs. Dulcimer, with a look of horror. 'What has the coroner to do with it?' ' Why, my dear madam, as Mr. Harefield's death is both sudden and mysterious, there will naturally be an inquest. The notices have been sent round to the jury already, I beheve, and the inquiry will be held here this afternoon. To-morrow being Christmas Day, you see, allows of no time being lost.' ' Oh, this is too dreadful ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Dulcimer ; ' that poor girl, without a single relation, in a house of death, under such fearful circum stances; I must get her away.' ' I would strongly recommend you to do nothing of the kind. Miss Harefield had better stop here. She will be wanted as a witness, for it was she who discovered her father's death. Her leaving the"], [38, "30 AN OPEN VERDICT. house might create a scandal. She need not be alone. Bella can stay with her.' 'Poor girl/ sighed Mrs. Dulcimer 'What a position ! ' And then, the ruling passion stiU dominant in her mind, she thought of Sir Kenrick Culverhouse, and what an opportunity this time of trouble might afford for the ripening of friendship into love. It was a time in which a young woman would naturally lean upon a masculine mind for support and guidance, in which words of comfort would sound stronger from mascuhne hps. ' If Kenrick were oidy here to-day/ thought Mrs. Dulcimer. And then she remembered that Sir Kenrick had given her a half-promise that he would come back to Yorkshire in time to eat his Christmas dinner at the Vicarage."], [39, "CHAPTER III. BEFORE THE CORONER. At the table where Christian Harefield had sat at meat on Sunday evening, with his daughter and his daughter's companion, sat the coroner, in the gather ing dusk of Monday afternoon, with his jurymen in a row of heavy oaken chairs on either side of him \u2014 looking very much as if they were sitting at a new Barmecide's dinner \u2014 to inquire into the cause or causes of Christian Harefield's death.

Mr. Scratchell sat at a corner of the table, note-book in hand, to watch the proceedings as Aliss Harefield's legal adviser. He had appointed himself to that post, and no one had disputed his right to it. Beatrix had asked for no legal advice. She knew that her father was dead, suddenly, mys teriously, awfully, but no instinct of her mind im pelled her to seek comfort, counsel, or succour from Mr. ScratcheU, or to throw herself into the sanctuary of English law. The coroner was Dr. Judson, of Great Yafford, a medical man much respected in his district, and a coroner who indulged in the eccentricity of think ing for himself. The proceedings were opened by the examination of Mr. Namby, who gave his opinion very decidedly upon the cause of death. He had no doubt upon this point. The deceased gentleman had died from"], [41, "33 BEFORE THE CORONER. an overdose of opium. He described those indica tions which led him to believe this, and Dr. Judson, who knew Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence by heart, knew that the witness was ridit. Peacock, the butler, the last person who had seen Mr. Harefield alive, was the first witness examined, after the medical evidence had been heard, and the jury had withdrawn to view the body. He described the visit of the foreign gentleman, and his departure. He was not able to recaU the gentleman's name, although he had glanced at his card before he carried it to Mr. Harefield. The name was a foreign one, and had slipped out of his memory directly after he read it. Coroner. How long was he with your master ? Peacock. It might be from an hour to an hour and a half. We were just beginning our suppers in the servants' hall when the bell rang, and I opened the door to the strange gentleman. We hadn't finished many minutes when Mr. Harefield rung his bell for me to let the strange gentleman out. VOL. il D"], [42, "34 AN OPEN VERDICT. Coroner. Do you usuaUy take an hour and a half at your supper ? Peacock. We might take as much on a Sunday night. Coroner (with grim facetiousness, reflecting that this is how his servants make such an impression on the butcher's biU). Oh, I see, on Sunday night you eat a httle extra. The better the day the better the deed. Then, as you are in the habit of sitting an hour and a hah at your supper, you conclude that the stranger was with Mr. Harefield as long as that. Peacock. I should say about that time. Coroner. How often did you see Mr. Harefield after the stranger left ? Peacock. I went into the room twice\u2014 once with some fresh logs, once with coals. Coroner. Did you observe anything peculiar in your master's manner ? Peacock. No, sir. When I went in the first time he was sitting before the fire, a little moody -like, staring straight before him ; but he was moody in his ways most times. When I went in with the coals, he was sitting there still \u2014 like a statue. I asked"], [43, "BEFORE THE CORONER. 35 him if there was anything more wanted, and he said, 'No, Peacock, nothing more.' That was his general reply. I couldn't see any difference in his voice or manner. Coroner. Were you with Miss Harefield this morning when she discovered her father's death ? Peacock. I was just outside the door when sh e went in and found him lying dead upon the sofa. Coroner. In which room was he found ? Peacock. In Mrs. Harefield's sitting-room. It hadn't entered into my head \u2014 or into the housekeeper's head \u2014 to look for him in that room, for the room was never used. Mr. Harefield kept the key, and it was kept locked at aU times, like a tomb. Coroner. Who suggested looking into that room ? Peacock. Miss Harefield. ' Let us go into every room in the house/ she said, ' my mother's rooms first of ah/ Coroner. Did she give any reason for making that suggestion ? Peacock. Yes \u2014 she named her reason.

That is what I understood her to mean. Coroner. Then Miss Harefield led the way to the room in which her father was found ? Peacock. She did. Coroner. And he was quite dead when you found him? Peacock. Quite dead. When Mr. Namby saw my master he said he must have been dead some hours. He was stone cold \u2014 icy cold. Mr. Namby said icy coldness of the body was one of the signs of poisoning by opium. Coroner. You need not tell us what Mr. Namby said. Mr. Namby has told us his opinion.

I have never heard him complain of pam."], [45, "BEFORE THE CORONER. 37 Coroner. But have you never had cause to suspect him of taking opium ? He was a man of reserved and lonely habits. Have you never seen him in a stupefied, dreamy state, such as you may have heard of or read of as peculiar to opium eaters ? Peacock. Never. Coroner. Have you ever seen any bottle con taining opium, or any bottle labelled opium, or laudanum, in his rooms ? Peacock. Never. Coroner. Have you ever seen anything in your late master's manner indicating a disturbed state of mind \u2014 the sort of thing which is usuaUy caUed not being quite right in one's mind ? Peacock. No, sir. My late master was not a cheerful man. He was a gentleman who preferred to live alone. He had always lived shut up in his own rooms since his wife's death.

She"], [46, "38 AN OPEN VERDICT. had been present at the discovery of Mr. Harefield's death. She had dined with him on the previous evening, and would naturally be an independent witness, and a more unbiassed judge of his de meanour and mental condition than either his old servants or his daughter. BeUa gave her evidence with a graceful timidity and a gentle firmness which charmed her hearers. She felt that it was her first public appearance, and that the eyes of Little Yafford \u2014 or possibly of a much wider world than Little Yafford \u2014 were upon her. She stood at the end of the long table, with her clear blue eyes fixed respectfully upon the coroner, her little white hands clasped, her head shghtly bent. Even her father's cold eye perceived that there was grace and prettiness in this familiar face and figure. ' A girl like that ought to get a husband able to support her/ thought Mr. ScratcheU, who regarded marriage as an institution devised for taking daughters off a father's hands, and throwing the onus of maintaining them upon an obliging stranger."], [47, "BEFORE THE CORONER. 39 Coroner. You dined with Mr. Harefield yester day evening, I believe ? BeUa. Yes. Coroner. What impression did his manner make upon you ? BeUa. I felt very sorry for Beatrix \u2014 for Miss Harefield. Coroner. Why ? Bella. It was so sad to see a father and daughter so unloving. Or I shoidd say sad to see a daughter so little loved. Coroner. Then you conclude the want of affection was on Mr. Harefield's side ? Bella (after a moment of hesitation). Yes. Coroner. Do you mean that Mr. Harefield was absolutely harsh in his treatment of his daughter ? BeUa. Both harsh and cold. I should havo felt it painfully had I been Miss Harefield.

You are bound to answer any ques tions bearing upon the subject of this inquiry. I want particularly to know the state of feeling bet ween Mr. Harefield and his daughter. Now what was the unhappiness of which you have spoken ? Bella (with her eyes wandering piteously round the stolid faces of the jury, and at last seeking counsel in the looks of her father). Am I really obliged to answer this question? Scratchell. Yes, yes, girl, you'd better answer. BeUa. The unhappiness was about a gentleman to whom Miss Harefield is deeply attached. Mr. Harefield forbade her to see this gentleman, or to hold any communication with him. Coroner. And that had been the cause of ill feeling between the father and daughter ? BeUa. I have never said dl-feeling. I only say that Mr. Harefield's manner to his daughter was morose and unkind."], [49, "BEFORE THE CORONER. 41 Coroner. Did you perceive anything approach ing to eccentricity or mental disturbance in his manner last evening? Bella. Nothing. Coroner. Should you consider him a man likely to commit suicide ? BeUa. I should say not. He was always reserved and gloomy. Coroner. But not more so yesterday evening than usual ? Bella. No more than usual. Coroner. How did Miss Harefield seem im pressed by the discovery of her father's death ? BeUa. She seemed stunned. Coroner. She said very little, I conclude ? Bella. She said nothing. The awfulness of the discovery seemed to turn her to stone. The next and last witness was one in whom even those stolid jurymen felt a keen interest. The next witness was Beatrix Harefield, who came into the room slowly, leaning upon Mrs. Dulcimer, a living image of horror and amazement. Some one, seeing how feebly she moved from"], [50, "42 AN OPEN VERDICT. the door to the table, brought her a chair ; or, in the richer phraseology of the reporters, she was ' accommodated with a seat.' She sat, looking straight at the distant coroner, seen dimly by the light of tall wax candles in old silver candelabra, at the end of an avenue of jurymen. Beatrix was questioned as to the finding of her father's body. Her replies were at first hardly audible, but voice and manner grew firmer as she went on. Coroner. What induced you to suggest that your mother's sitting-room should be the first place to be searched? Beatrix. Because I fancied my father's thoughts would dweU upon my mother last night. Coroner. Why ? Beatrix. The gentleman who came here \u2014 after an absence of many years \u2014 was a countryman and friend of my mother's. That would carry my father's thoughts back. Coroner. Can you tell me the name of this gentleman ? His evidence would be important as to the state of your father's mind yesterday evening."], [51, "43 BEFORE THE CORONER. Beatrix. I have heard him called Antonio. Coroner. That was his Christian name, no doubt. Have you never heard his surname ? Beatrix. Never, to my knowledge. I was a child when he used to visit here. I have heard my father and mother both speak of him as Antonio. Coroner. Was your father in the habit of going into that locked up room of your mother's ? Beatrix. I know he went there sometimes. Coroner. How do you know that ? Beatrix. I found the key left in the door once. No one could have left it there but my father. Coroner. The room was kept locked, I under- stand. The members of the household were not allowed to go in. Beatrix. It was kept locked from every one for ten years. Coroner. Have you never been in the room during that time ? Beatrix. Once only.

Beatrix. I have no reason to suppose so. We lived very much apart, but from what I saw of his mode of hfe, I do not think my father ever took opium. Coroner. You have never heard him complain of pain of any kind \u2014 rheumatism or neuralgia, for instance \u2014 which might have induced him to seek rehef from opiates? Beatrix. Never. Coroner. Do you know whether there was any laudanum in the house at the time of your father's death ? Beatrix (with evident agitation, and after a noticeable pause). No, there was no laudanum in the house at the time of my father's death. Coroner. Are you sure of that ? Beatrix. Quite sure. I have suffered from sleeplessness for many weeks. Last week I bought a httle laudanum, and have been taking it nightly in smaU doses. I took rather a larger dose than usual last night and emptied the bottle."], [53, "45 BEFORE THE CORONER. The jury, who had been getting a little absent minded during what they considered a somewhat wire-drawn interrogation, became suddenly on the alert. Four and twenty eyes were fixed inquisitively upon the pale face of the witness. A gentleman who stood in the shadow of the doorway watching the pro ceedings grew a shade paler than he had been before. Coroner. Did any one know of your taking this laudanum ? Beatrix. No one. Coroner. Was it recommended by your medical adviser ? Beatrix. No. I asked Mr. Namby to give me opiates, but he refused. Coroner. And, unknown to every one, you bought laudanum, and took it in nightly doses ? Beatrix. Yes. The sleepless nights were so miserable. I think I should have gone mad if they had continued much longer. Coroner. Was there any cause for these sleep less nights ? Beatrix (faltering, and with a distressed look). I bad been unhappy lately."], [54, "46 AN OPEN VERDICT. Coroner. There was a love affair, was there not, which your father disapproved ? Beatrix. Yes. Coroner. Was there iU-feehng between you and your father about this love affair ? Beatrix.

No. I submitted to my father's will, but he knew that when I came of age I should fulfil the engagement of which he disapproved. Coroner. In other words, you defied him ? Beatrix. No. I only told him that I should be faithful to the man I loved. Coroner. No matter how objectionable that person might be to your father ? Beatrix. He had no cause to object. He ought to have been proud that I had won the love of so good a man. Coroner. Perhaps a young lady is not always the best judge upon that point. Now, wiU you tell me where you got this laudanum ? Eeatrix. At Great Yafford."], [55, "47 BEFORE THE CORONER. Coroner. At which chemist's ? Beatrix. I got it from several chemists. The chemist I first went to would give me only a very smaU quantity. I went on to another chemist and got a httle more. Coroner. That was very ingenious. How many chemists did you go to in this manner ? Beatrix. I believe I went to five or six shops. Coroner. Getting a httle laudanum at each. How much did you get altogether ? Beatrix. When I emptied all the bottles into one there was a smaU bottle fuU. Coroner. I should like to see the bottle. Let it be sent for. Beatrix. It is in the little Indian cabinet on the writing-table in my bedroom. The bottle was fetched at the coroner's desire.

Tdl last night I kept it locked in my dressing-case."], [56, "48 AN OPEN VERDICT. Coroner. You are sure of that ? Beatrix. I am quite sure. This ended Beatrix Harefield's examination. After this the coroner adjourned the inquiry for a week, with a view to obtaining further evidence. He made a strong point of the desirability of obtain ing the evidence of the strange visitor who had been closeted with Mr. Harefield for an hour and a half on the night before his death."], [57, "CHAPTER IV. CHRISTMAS EVE. Beatrix went back to her room, accompanied by Mrs. Dulcimer and BeUa ScratcheU. In going through the dimly-lighted hall she passed a group of figures standing close together near the foot of the stahcase; the Vicar, Mr. Namby, and one other, a taller figure than either of the two, a man standing with half-averted face, listening to some remark of Mr. Dulcimer's. Towards this one, whose face was hidden, Beatrix looked intently, but there was no time for more than that one earnest look, for Mrs. Dulcimer's supporting arm was round her, and BeUa was on the other side.

In the place of that stern ruler there was now only the lifeless clay. A dreadful blankness and emptiness had descended upon the house, so quiet, so changeless heretofore, but now per vaded with the one idea of death. Beatrix shivered as she passed the door of the room where her dead father was lying. Mrs. Dulci mer perceived that shuddering recoil, and again sug gested that her sweet Beatrix should come to the Vicarage. But again Beatrix was firm. ' Do you think I am frightened at the thought of death?' she asked bitterly. ' My father's life was a living death \u2014 to me. He is no further removed from me now than he was yesterday.' 'My dear child, if I could stay with you here, I would not so much mind/ said Mrs. Dulcimer, ' but I shaU be obliged to go back to the Vicarage almost immediately. There is Clement's tea. He would not think of sitting down to tea without me if he were ever so hungry. And then later in the evening there wdl be the carol singers. We always give"], [59, "CHRISTMAS EVE. 51 them cake and hot elder wine. So you see, my love, I shall be obliged to go.' Beatrix gave a weary sigh. ' Indeed, dear Mrs. Dulcimer, I shall be better alone/ she said. 'I am grateful for your kindness, but I would rather be alone. I do not want even BeUa, and I am sure it is cruel to keep her in this melancholy house. Do go home, BeUa, or go to the Vicarage with Mrs. Dulcimer and hear the carols.' ' Beatrix, how can you suppose that I would leave you ? ' exclaimed BeUa, and again Beatrix sighed weardy. It would have been an infinite relief to her to be quite alone. She had recognised Cyrd in that little group in the haU, and he had let her pass, without one word of consolation, without one pity ing look. He must have known that she was passing, she told herself, and he had kept his face averted ; he had stood coldly by and made no sign of sympathy or kindly feeling. Mrs. Dulcimer tied her bonnet strings, kissed Beatrix repeatedly, promised to come and see her directly after morning service next day, and"], [60, "52 AN OPEN VERDICT. then hurried off to superintend the Vicar's evening meal. ' I shouldn't be surprised if Kenrick was to pop in upon us to-night/ she said, as she was going away. ' He promised to spend Christmas with us.' Beatrix gave a little start at Kenrick's name. He was so near Cyrd in her mind, and just now she was deeply moved by Cyril's strange coldness. Mrs. Dulcimer saw her startled look, and had an inward movement of triumph. Here was one of her good-natured schemes assuredly about to prosper. Kenrick had evidently made an impres sion upon Beatrix ; and now death had made Beatrix mistress of a splendid fortune. 'I only hope that foolish boy wiU remember his engagement to eat his Christmas dinner with us,' thought the Vicar's wife, as she trudged sturddy homewards, with her petticoats held weU out of the mud, and her country-made boots defying the slushy road. When Mrs. Dulcimer had gone the two girls sat at opposite sides of the hearth, very much as they had been seated the night before, only there was no"], [61, "CHRISTMAS EVE. 53 pretence of reading to-night. Beatrix sat looking idly at the fire with great melancholy eyes. BeUa watched her, ready to offer any scrap of consolation which might suggest itself. ' It seems painfuUy clear that my father com mitted suicide,' Beatrix said, at the end of a long reverie. ' Oh, I hope not,' exclaimed Bella, piously. ' We must not think that, dear. He may have taken an overdose of laudanum/ ' Yes, if he had been in the habit of taking lau danum. But he was nq>t/ ' How can you know that ? Poor Mr. Harefield was so reserved. He lived so much apart from you.' ' But if he had taken laudanum habitually some body would have known of it. Peacock, for instance, who always waited upon him. No, BeUa, there was something in that Italian's visit. I believe my father poisoned himself.' ' But why ? ' ' For the last ten years his life has been one long regret. Yes. I am sure of that now. His coldness and unkindness to me were the growth of despair."], [62, "54 AN OPEN VERDICT. He told me that he had closed his heart against all human affection ten years ago.

' Do you mean that there is any creature on this earth so vde in mind and heart as to be capable of beheving that I poi soned my father ? ' ' My dear Beatrix, there are people wicked enough to be ready to beheve anything evd of those who are richer than themselves/ 'I am sorry such a hideous suggestion should come from you, BeUa/ said Beatrix, coldly. BeUa saw that she had gone a httle too far, and knelt down by her dear Beatrix's chair, and"], [64, "56 AN OPEN VERDICT. tried to soothe the irritation her suggestions had caused. Beatrix's wounded feeling was not easily appeased. 'If such a thing can enter into the mind of my earliest friend, my old playfellow, what mea sure of evd am I to expect from strangers ? ' she said. ' My dearest Beatrix, have I been speaking of my own thoughts ? I only said I was sorry you mentioned those unfortunate purchases at Yafford.' 'I shall never be sorry for having spoken the truth.' Mrs. Dulcimer had her wish gratified. At the gate of the Vicarage a large and blundering vehicle loomed upon her through the rainy darkness. It was one of the Great Yafford flies, a cumbrous conveyance of wood, iron, and mouldy leather, which Mr. BoUen, of ' The George,' innkeeper and postmaster, facetiously caUed a landau.

She forgot the awfulness of things at the Water House, forgot everything but this propitious ar rival of Sir Kenrick. ' My dear Kenrick ! ' she exclaimed, making a friendly rush at the newly-arrived guest, as he stood in the haU talking to the Vicar. ' How good of you to remember your promise!' 'My dear Mrs. Dulcimer, do you suppose there is any house in which I would sooner spend my Christmas than in this ? But what terrible news this is about Mr. Harefield.' 'Is it not awful?

She could live very happdy as the foundress and superior of a Protestant con vent, like Madame de Maintenon, at St. Cyr.' ' With this difference,' said Sir Kenrick. ' Madame de Maintenon was an old woman, and had had two husbands.' ' But her only period of happiness was at St. Cyr.' ' So she said ; yet she intrigued considerably to be Queen of France, a la main gauche.' ' Clement ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Dulcimer, looking the image of horror ; ' the word convent makes me shudder.

Kenrick had a fine appetite after his long damp journey from the South/ AU tea-time the talk was of Mr. Harefield and Beatrix. The Vicar had been in the little group of listeners standing by the door of the Water House dining-room, and had heard the whole of the coroner's inquiry. ' That poor girl ought to have somebody to watch the proceeding's on her behalf/ said Mr. Dulcimer. ' I sliaU go over to Great Yafford on Wednesday and see Mivers. He is about the cleverest lawyer in the town.' 'Mr. Scratchell would surely protect Beatrix's interests/ suggested Mrs. Dulcimer. 'Mr. Scratched is very good as a coUector of rents, but I do not give him credit for being exactly tlie man for a critical position/ ' What do you mean by a critical position, Clement ?

Her brain is in a state of stupor.' ' It was very lucky for her that she did make that statement about her purchase of the laudanum,' said the Vicar. ' But why, if the admission was likely to do her harm ? ' asked Kenrick. ' Because to have concealed the fact would have done her more harm. The chemists from whom she bought the stuff would have talked about it/ ' Of course/ assented Mrs. Dulcimer, ' everything is talked about in Great Yafford. Though it is such a large town, it is almost as bad as a village for gossip.' Not at the Vicarage only, but at every tea table in Little Yafford the inquest at the Water House was the only subject of conversation. Though very few people, save those actually concerned, had crossed the threshold of the house during the inquiry, yet every body seemed to know aU about it.

Opinions at present were distinguished by their vagueness. There was a general idea that Mr. Harefield's death was a very mysterious affair \u2014 that a great deal more would come out at the next inquiry \u2014 that the butler and Bella ScratcheU were both keeping back a great deal \u2014 that Beatrix and her father had lived much more unhappdy together than anybody had hitherto suspected \u2014 that Beatrix, being of Italian origin on the mother's side, was likely to do strange things. In support of which sweeping conclusion the better informed gossips cited the examples of Lucretia Borgia, Beatrice Cenci, and a young woman christened Bianca, whose surname nobody was able to remember. Late in the evening Cyrd Culverhouse came to the Vicarage. He had promised to be there to hear the carol singers, in whom, as his own scholars, he was bound to be interested. He was looking pale and worried, and Mrs. Dulcimer immediately suggested a tumbler of Rebecca's port wine negus,' a restorative which the curate obstinately refused."], [72, "64 AN OPEN VERDICT.

It seemed to remove Beatrix further away from her. But then she had always been able to get on better with Bella than with Beatrix. ' You are not without friends, Beatrix, and ad visers in this hour of trouble,' she said, encou ragingly. And then she told Beatrix about the two lawyers to whom the Vicar and his curate had written. ' Strange, was it not, that Cyril and my husband should both think of the same thing ? ' 'Very strange,' said Beatrix, deeply thoughtful. ' You see, my dear, the important question is, where did your father get the laudanum?' ' Oh, I think I know that/ answered Beatrix. ' You know, and did not teU the coroner ? How very foolish!'"], [75, "67 GLOOMY DAYS. ' I did not think of it yesterday. I could think of nothing. I felt as if I had lost myself in some hideous dream.

To-day, for the first time, she thought of her own position, which was assuredly a horrible one. But she contemplated it without a shadow of fear. Bella's speech yester day, Mrs. Dulcimer's hints to-day, had shown her that \u2014 in their minds at least \u2014 it seemed pos sible that people might suspect her of being her father's murderer. There were people who would think that she, to whom crime seemed as far off as the stars, had blossomed all at once into the most deliberate and vilest of criminals. Could this really be so ? Were there people capable of believing such a tiling ? Why was not Cyril near her in this hour of doubt and trouble ? Mrs Dulcimer came with her good-natured attempts at consolation; but he, her natural consoler, held himself aloof, now, when there was no one to bar the door against him. Was it delicacy that kept him away? Yes, possibly. He might consider it an outrage against that silent master of the house to cross his threshold unbidden. ' By and by, after the funeral, he will come,' she thought."], [78, "70 AN OPEN VERDICT. He had entered the house yesterday as one of the public. She had seen him in the hall, but he had either not seen her, or had not chosen to recognise her. These things were bitter to her, but she fancied there must be some wise meaning in his conduct which she could not fathom. ' But he might at least have written to me,' she thought, piteously. Bella came home from the Park by and by, full of the history of her day, trying to change the current of Beatrix's thoughts by talking briskly of all that had happened in the Piper manage. Mr. Piper had been wonderfully kind, and had insisted upon the brougham being brought out to take her back to the Water House. 'I have no doubt the coachman hates me for bringing him out this damp evening/ said Bella, ' but Mr. Piper would not let me come any other way. \" .

' Then you dined alone Avith Mr. Piper and the children ? ' inquired Beatrix, in the same listless tone. 'Not quite alone. Miss Coyle Avas there.' Miss Coyle was a maiden lady of intense gen tility, who possessed a small annuity \u2014 bestowed on her by the head of the house of Coyle, which was supposed to be a family of distinction \u2014 and who inhabited one of the prettiest cottages in Little Yafford \u2014 a rustic bower Avith a porch of green trel lis-A. ork, curtained Avith clematis and Avoodbine. The cottage was so small that a single friend dropping in to tea filled it to overfloAving, insomuch that the small servant could hardly turn the corner of the parlour door with the tea-tray. This smallness Miss Coyle found economical. She visited a great deal"], [80, "72 AN OPEN VERDICT. in Little Yafford, and was not called upon to exercise any hospitality in return. ' With my poor little place it would be ridiculous to talk about giving parties/ she used to say, ' but if my friends will chop in upon me any afternoon they AviU always find a good cup of tea.' Thus Miss Coyle contrived to cry quits with the best people in Little Yafford at the cost of a cup of tea. Even Mrs. Dulcimer \u2014 who prided herself upon the superiority of her tea \u2014 confessed that Miss Coyle excelled as a tea maker, and would condescend to drop in at the cottage once in a way on a hot summer afternoon, when the roads were ankle-deep in dust, and seemed longer than usual. Miss Coyle had not only tea to offer for the refreshment of the body, but she generally had some scrap of news for the entertainment of her visitor's mmd. She was a wonderful woman in this way, and seemed always to be the first to know everything that occurred hi Little Yafford, as if she had been the centre of an in-visible telegraphic system. 'Oh, Miss Coyle was there, was she?' said Beatrix."], [81, "73 GLOOMY DAYS. ' Yes, she has been at the Park a good deal since the beginning of Mrs. Piper's illness. She goes to sit with poor Mrs. Piper almost every afternoon, and they talk of the wickedness of servants. Miss Coyle's father kept seven servants \u2014 four indoor and three outdoor. I have heard her describe them all, again and again. They seem to have been models ; but Miss Coyle said they belonged to a race that has disappeared off the face of the earth \u2014 like the Drift people, or the poor Swiss creatures who lived in the lakes. You may imagine how lively it is to hear Miss Coyle and Mrs. Piper bewailing the iniquities of the present race.' ' Did Miss Coyle speak about my father \u2014 or me?' asked Beatrix, with an anxious look. \u00ab She remembered meeting Miss Coyle at the Vicarage two or three times, and she had a vague notion that if this lady had assisted at a memorable scene, Avhen the sinless among the crowd were bidden to cast the first stone, she would assuredly have been ready with her pebble.

All that the most expensive undertaker in Great Yafford could devise to do honour to the dead was done ; and Little Yafford, draining the dregs of its Christmas cup of dissipation, felt that Squire Harefield's funeral made an appropriate finish to the festivities of the season. The Aveather had changed ; the bare barren fields were lightly powdered Avith snow, the black ridge of moorland was sharply cut against a bright blue sky. ' It's an outing, anyhow/ said the people of Little Yafford, and there was a good deal of extra liquor consumed at small wayside beerhouses after the funeral.

Two days later came the adjourned inquiry before the coroner. This time Beatrix Harefield's interests were watched by the lawyer from London, a httle dark man, with heavy eyebrows and a hard mouth, a defender who inspired Beatrix Avith a nameless horror, although she could but be grateful to Cyril Culverhouse for his forethought in procuring her such skilled service. Mrs. Dulcimer had harped upon the curate's though tfulness in sending for one of the cleverest men in London to protect her dear Beatrix from the possibdities of evil. ' It was very kind of him/ Beatrix said some what constrainedly, ' but I would much rather have dispensed with the London lawyer \u2014 or any lawyer.' ' My dearest Beatrix, Mr. Dulcimer and Cyril must understand the exigencies of the case far better than you can, and both are agreed that the inquest cannot be too carefully watched on your behalf.

' 'You suggested it, when you spoke of people saying dreadful things about me.' ' My dear Beatrix, I only meant to say that the Avorld is very censorious. People are ahvays ready to say cruel things \u2014 about the most innocent persons. It was so in David's time even. See how often he alludes to the malice and injustice of his enemies.' Beatrix said no more, but, when Mrs. Dulcimer had left her, she sat for a long time with her face hidden in her clasped hands, in blank tearless grief. ' I see now why he shuns me,' she said to herself. ' He believes that I poisoned my father.' Beatrix was one of the first witnesses examined at the adjourned inquest."], [87, "GLOOMY DAYS. 79 She made her statement about the medicine chest in her mother's room, and the empty laudanum bottle, simply and briefly. ' Why did you not mention this before ? ' asked the coroner. ' I forgot it.' ' What ! could you forget a fact of such importance ? You found your father dead in that very room, and you forgot the existence of a medi cine chest, which, according to your statement of to day, contained the poison by which he died.' ' The fact did not occur to me at the previous examination,' Beatrix answered firmly. Her manner and bearing were curiously different from what they had been on the previous occasion. She was deadly pale, but firm as a rock. That firmness of hers, the calm distinctness of her tones, the proud carriage of her beautiful head, impressed the coroner and jury strongly, but not favourably. They had been more ready to sympathize with her a week ago, when she had stood before them trembling, and bowed down by her distress. The medicine chest was brought from the late"], [88, "80 AN OPEN VERDICT. Mrs. Harefield's room. There was the bottle as Beatrix had described it \u2014 an empty bottle winch had obviously contained laudanum. ' Do you know if your mother was in the habit of taking laudanum ?' asked the coroner. ' I know very httle about her. All that I can remember of her is like a dream.' Mr. Namby was re-examined upon this question of the laudanum. He remembered that Mrs. Harefield had suffered from neuralgic pains in the head and face during the last year of her residence at the Water House. She had complained to him, and he had prescribed for her, not successfully. He was of opinion that the Water House was too much on a level with the river. He would not go so far as to say the house was damp, but he was sure it was not dry-. It was not unlikely that Mrs. Harefield would resort to laudanum as a palliative. He had never given her laudanum. Peacock, the butler, was examined. He remem bered Mrs. Harefield complaining of pain in the head and face. It was called tic-dollerer. He fancied the name meant something like toothache, independent of"], [89, "81 GLOOMY DAYS. teeth. As he understood it you might have tic-dollerer anywheres. He remembered being in Great Yafford with the carriage one day when Mrs. Harefield told him to go into a chemist's shop and ask for some laudanum. He got a small quantity in a bottle. Mrs. Harefield used often to drive into Great Yafford. Sometimes he went on the box with the coachman \u2014 sometimes not. He knew that she had a medicine chest in her room. He had heard Chugg, the young woman who waited on her, say that she took sleeping draughts. The jury agreed upon their verdict, after some deliberation. Mr. Harefield had died from the effects of laudanum, but by whom administered there was no evidence to show. VOL II."], [90, "CHAPTER VI. BELLA'S REVENGE.

Mr. Dulcimer was likely to prove the \"most indulgent of guardians ; Mr. Scratchell was subservient to the last degree, his sole anxiety being to retain his position, and to ingratiate himself and his family in Miss Hare field's favour.

In the box which she had just packed \u2014 to be brought home later \u2014 there were many things that she had not taken to the Water House, including a handsome black silk gown, and innumerable trifles in the shape of gloves, collars, and neck-ribbons ; but there was one thing which Miss Scratchell carried aAvay in her pocket, and which she held to be of more importance than all her finery. This was the sealed envelope which she had found upon Mr. Harefield's writing-table. 'For my daughter Beatrix.' She took it from her pocket when she was safely locked in her own room, secure from the intrusion of the famdy herd. She sat with the packet on her lap, thoughtfully contemplating it.

She had made up her mind that this sealed packet contained the key to the mystery of Christian Harefield's death. So long as the seal remained unbroken that death Avould remain a mystery. No one would know whether it was suicide or murder ; and this uncer tainty would hang like a cloud over Beatrix. This was Isabella Scratchell's revenge. That pink and white prettiness of hers was not incom patible Avith the capacity to seize an opportunity and to persevere in an inexorable hatred. ' She has beauty and wealth, and a good old name/ thought Bella; 'but so long as her father's death remains unexplained she will hardly have the love of Cyril Culverhouse.' Bella had heard enough from Mr. Piper and Miss Coyle on Christmas Day to know very well which way opinion was drifting in Little Yafford. It was a settled thing already in the minds of a good many deep thinkers, and profound students of human nature as exhibited in the weekly papers, that Beatrix Harefield knew more about"], [96, "88 AN OPEN VERDICT. her father's death than anybody else. The very horror of the idea that her hand had put the poison in his way gave it a morbid attraction for tea-table conversation. There was a growing opinion that the coroner's jury had done less than their duty in returning an open verdict. 'The verdict would have been very different if Miss Harefield had been a labouring man's daughter,' said Miss Coyle, who had more to say on this subject than any one else, and who was always uncompromising in her opinions. Bella was not sorry to leave the Water House, though home looked a little more squalid and un tidy than usual, after the subdued splendour of Miss Harefield's mansion. She had not been able to feel at her ease with Beatrix during this last visit. Even to her essentially false nature there was some effort required to preserve a demeanour of unvarying sweetness towards a person she de tested.

And now that Miss Scales was on the scene, with eyes which saw eveiything, Bella felt that the veneer of affection might be too thin to hide the hardness of the wood underneath it. So Bella resumed the monotonous order of her home life, breakfasted at eight, and presented herself at the Park upon the stroke of nine, where the Piper children, clustering round the newly lighted fire in the schoolroom, hated her for her punctuality.

But Mrs. Pomfret did not wear a widow's cap because it was becoming, or comfort able. She wore it as a badge of respecta bdity. Mr. Culverhouse was at home. He opened the parlour door at the sound of Bella's voice, and looked out. ' Is it you, Miss Scratchell ? Hoav do you do ? ' he said, with calm friendliness. 'Pray come in. Is Mary Smithers worse ?

His hat and cane were on a side table. There Avas no disorder, nothing squalid or un sightly. ' No, I have not come from Mary Smithers/ said Bella. ' I want to eidist your sympathy for poor Mrs. Piper.' And then Bella explained the sad condition into which Mrs. Piper had fallen, how in the hour of sickness her soul hankered after the strong meat of the Baptist chapel where she had worshipped in her youth, and how she would assuredly seek for comfort from Mr. Mowler, unless the Church of England came to her rescue.

' There is no goodness in a clergyman trying to do his duty, any more than in a baker carry ing round his loaves/ he said, coolly. He put on his overcoat, and took up his hat and cane, and he and Bella went out together. That cool tone of his wounded her keenly. ' Are you still with Miss Harefield ? ' he said, at the garden gate. Bella gave him an icy look. The mention of that name was a second stab. ' No, I have left her some time: Cyril saw the look, and perceived the unfriendli ness in the tone. He put down both to a wrong cause. His face was full of care as he walked to the Park.

Bella sighed, thinking of the harassed house keeper at home. For the rich manufacturer's wife such small cares were vanity, but for Mrs. Scratchell they were the serious things of life. With her it was not so much the question as to whether she had been cheated out of a pound or two of meat, but whether she could honestly afford a Sunday joint for her children. ' Mr. Culverhouse said he would call again soon,' said Mrs. Piper, and this gave Bella the hope of meeting him at the Park some morning.

These difficulties had prolonged the morning's lessons until after the children's dinner, and it was nearly four o'clock when Bella, thoroughly wearied out, put on her neat little black bonnet and bade her sullen pupils good-bye. ' I hope you don't bear malice, Elizabeth,' she said at parting. ' I am obhged to be a httle severe about those scales. It's for your good, you know.

' I am not going to be a governess.' ' Very fortunate for you, my dear/ answered Bella, lightly, 'for if you Avere obliged to get your living in that way, you would have to be one of the poor things who don't object to make themselves generally useful ; which means that they are to make all their pupils' clothes, and work a great deal harder than housemaids.'

He greeted her with friendliness, and they went out into the wintry twilight together. ' I am glad you have been to see Mrs. Piper again,' said Bella, ' your visits have done her so much good.' ' I am very happy to hear that. She is a kindly, simple-hearted creature, sorely tried by prosperity, which is for some natures a harder ordeal than ad- versity.' They walked on for some distance in sdence, Bella looking thoughtfully at her companion, every now and then, speculating upon the causes of his absent manner and troubled face. ' I am afraid you have been working too hard lately, Mr. Culverhouse/ she said at last. ' You are looking ill and wearied.' ' I have been troubled in mind/ he answered.

' Do you mean that Mrs. Dulcimer is not kind to Beatrix ? ' asked Bella, her heart beating fast and fiercely. From the moment he mentioned Beatrix Hare field's name in the same breath with his own anxie ties he had in a manner admitted his love for her. ' It is not in Mrs. Dulcimer's nature to be unkind,' said Cyril, ' but I fear she is not so warmly attached to Miss Harefield as she was a short time ago.' 'You think perhaps she has been influenced by things that have been said in Little Yafford/ suggested Bella, eagerly. ' I fear so.' ' I am very sorry for that. I pity Beatrix with all my heart.

There was no one else in Little Yafford with any great pretensions to beauty, and a great many people had praised Bella's delicate prettiness. So long as he was devoted to Beatrix, Mr. Culverhouse would no doubt remain stone blind to the charms of Bella; but Beatrix once banished from his heart, there would be plenty of room there for a small person with smiling blue eyes and winning manners.

The cloud that hung over her young life might be a shadow which the light of truth would by and by dispel ; but, untd the truth should appear, broad and clear as sunlight, he could not take Beatrix Harefield to his heart, he could not bind his life with hers. Did he believe her gudty of that last and worst of crimes, the murder of a father ? Hardly. But he was not fully assured of her innocence. His mind had been racked with doubt \u2014 ever since that day of the inquest when he had stood in the doorway and Avatched her agonized face and listened to her faltering words. There is nothing that the human mind more unwillingly believes than a strange coincidence ; and that coincidence of Miss Harefield's purchase of the laudanum w -thin a week of her father's death by laudanum had been too much for Cyrd's faith. Had his beloved been a penniless orphan, and no worldly gain to be had from loving her, he might have reconcded his doubt Avith his honour and married her, trusting to time for the elucidation of the mystery that now stained her young life with the taint of possible gudt. But in this"], [119, "CYRIL RENOUNCES LOVE AND FORTUNE. Ill case there was too much for him to win \u2014 and in every feeling that drew him to Beatrix he recog nised a snare of Satan. Little by little he had come to know that public opinion in Little Yafford \u2014 and even in the neighbouring town of Great Yafford \u2014 had condemned Beatrix Harefield. Every detail of her conduct had been canvassed. Her late appearance on the morning of her father's death was taken as an evidence of gudt. She had feared to face the catastrophe her crime had brought about, and had feigned sleep' to stave off the appalling moment. Or she had simulated that heavy slumber in order to support her story about the laudanum. Her suggestion that her father should be sought for in a certain room, and the fact that he was found in that very room; her lame story \u2014 obviously an after thought \u2014 of the laudanum bottle in her mother's room \u2014 all told against her. The fact that an empty bottle had been found there proved nothing. Beatrix had no doubt placed it where it was found. There had been ample time for her to do so between the first and second meetings of the coroner's jury. Then as to motive ? Well, one need not look very"], [120, "112 AN OPEN VERDICT. far for that, argued Little Yafford. Mr. Harefield had been a tyrant, and had made his daughter's life miserable. She saw in his death a release from his tyranny, -with the assurance of wealth and independence. Everybody knew \u2014 thanks to Mrs. Dulcimer \u2014 how cruelly the wretched girl had been treated, even forbidden to visit the Vicarage, where she had always been so happy. And then there was that secret love affair which had been spoken about at the inquest. That would give a still stronger motive than her own wrongs. The more cultured inhabitants of Little Yafford, gentlemen who had dipped into old magazines and Annual Registers, quoted the case of Miss Blandy, an unfortunate young woman in the last century, who had given Henley-on-Thames, the place of her birth and residence, a classic fame by poisoning her father Avith ratsbane mixed in his water gruel. Again, as to character. Everybody who was familiar with Miss Harefield \u2014 by meeting her occa sionally in her drives and rides, or seeing her once a week at church \u2014 was aware that she was a girl of reserved and even melancholy temperament,"], [121, "CYRIL RENOUNCES LOVE AND FORTUNE. 113 from whom anything strange in conduct or morals might be expected. Then, again, she was of foreign extraction on the mother's side, and as such prone to crime. She was Italian, and with a natural leaning to poison and parricide. And again, those stock figures of the Borgia and Cenci were brought forward and contemplated shudderingly in the lurid glare of their gudt. Some weak-minded persons clung to the idea that Mr. Harefield had taken an overdose of opium umvittingly, but this tame and uninteresting theory was scouted by the majority. ' If Miss Harefield had not been an heiress we should have heard a good deal more about her father's death/ said Miss Coyle, draining her ancestral teapot at one of her temperate symposia. Miss Coyle Avas quite angry with the coroner for not having looked deeper into things. She spoke of him contemptuously as a hireling and a time server.

He knew what people thought of his beloved; he knew that even kindly Mrs. Dulcimer shook her head, and shrank from familiar contact with her husband's Avard. There was no one in Little Yafford except the Vicar who would take the slandered girl by the hand and boldly demonstrate his belief in her innocence. He, so easy-going on most occasions, was firm as a rock here. He would have Beatrix at his house, as often as she chose to come there \u2014 although the all-powerful Rebecca would hardly look civilly at her as she waited at table \u2014 and although poor Mrs. Dulcimer was sorely perplexed by her presence. Clement Dulcimer was staunch, and defied his parishioners, whom he stigmatised generally as a pack of venomous scandal mongers, whose uncultured minds, unable to appre ciate the strong sound meat of literature, battened upon carrion.

But there was the diffi culty. That stricken face of Beatrix's, those Avdd startled eyes \u2014 as he had seen them in the candle-lit room at the Water House\u2014 haunted him hke an evil dream.

Love might have bridged the gidf, but honour and duty held him back. He had not seen Beatrix since her father's death, and he had made up his mind to leave Little Yafford without seeing her. His business was to announce his resolve in a manner that Avould give her the least pain pos sible ; but he kneAv the blow would be hard to bear. He knew that she loved him with an intense and all- absorbing love. ' Oh, God, if she has sinned so deeply for the love of me,' he thought, in a moment of horror, finding himself suddenly on the edge of a black abyss of doubt, down Avhich he dared not look, ' if to bring about our union she has done this hideous thing ! But no, I will not believe her guilty. I Avdl pity and deplore her position, the victim of groundless sus picion. If I dare not sacrifice my duty to my love, I Avill at least believe her innocent.'

But Mr. Harefield had been dead a month, the first snowdrops were lifting their heads out of the dark borders, the robins were singing SAveetly in the lengthening afternoons, and nothing had been discovered to improve Miss Hare field's position in the eyes of Little Yafford. Nay rather, slander had grown and intensified with dis cussion, and people who had timorously hinted their doubts three Aveeks ago, now boldly declared their conviction of the young lady's gudt.

The curate worked so hard that Kenrick and he saw very httle of each other, and Kenrick had not yet ventured to sound Cyrd about Beatrix.

Kenrick could hardly imagine such folly, but he found it difficult to account for his cousin's avoidance of Miss Harefield on any other ground, unless indeed it were an overstrained delicacy which held him back from pushing his suit. On the evening on which Cyrd had arrived at a definite conclusion as to his line of conduct, his cousin dropped in at his lodgings, after the Vicarage tea, to smoke a friendly pipe. 'You are not going out this evening/ inquired Kenrick when they had shaken hands. ' No, I have some letters to Avrite.'

By slow degrees Beatrix arrived at an under standing of her position. People in Little Yafford believed her gudty of her father's murder. The idea was horrible, and she would have fled, but pride came to her rescue, and she stayed, defying all the slanderous tongues and cold cruel eyes in the viUage, from the judicial discourse and pale gray .orbs of Miss Coyle, to the lively comments and little red-brown rat-like optics of Mr. Tudway. She met cold looks and averted heads at the church door, where she had been wont to find herself saluted with nods and becks, and a world of sympathy and friendliness. Now and then she encountered a startling glance, as of wonder that she should dare to enter the church. Even Mrs. Dulcimer was cold, and seemed embarrassed by"], [137, "' THOSE ARE THE KILLING GRIEFS,' ETC. 129 Beatrix's presence, though affecting all the old cordiality. But the Vicar was full of kindness, and tried to make up for everybody else's cruelty His charity was not of the officious kind which forces itself upon people who do not want it, but it was that stronger and wider charity which is inexhaustible for those who do. He had let Beatrix come and go as she pleased hitherto, and had never pressed her to remain. Now he took her under his wing, brought her from the Water House to the Vicarage on his arm, and let the whole village see that he was not ashamed of his ward. ' Mr. Dulcimer always cared too much for the fleshpots of Egypt,' said Mrs. Coyle. 'Miss Harefield's money blinds him to her character. A sad thing to see a minister of the gospel so devoted to worldly things.' One day, stung by the disapproving look of a face that passed her in the village street, Beatrix made a sudden appeal to Miss Scales. ' What does it all mean ? ' she asked, in an agitated voice. 'Why do these people give me VOL. II. K"], [138, "130 AN OPEN VERDICT. such horrible looks \u2014 or pretend not to see me ? I don't want their friendship. They are nothing in the world to me. But I can't endure to live in an atmosphere of dislike. What does it mean ? ' 'My dear Beatrix, I had rather you did not ask me,' Miss Scales answered, stiffly. Her manner had been gaining stiffness ever since her return from Devonshire. A deeply bordered letter had come to announce the aunt's death, and a week after there had come another letter in a blue envelope, from a local solicitor who had draAvn the old lady's will, to inform Miss Scales that her aunt had appointed her sole executrix and residuary legatee. There was a legacy to the faithful old servant \u2014 a little sum in consols to provide for puss and pug \u2014 ancient favourites who had quarrelled daily for the last filteen yeais \u2014 and all the rest went to Miss Scales. She Avas now a lady of property like her pupil, with an unencumbered estate of nearly two hundred a year. ' It would have been quite two hundred,' said"], [139, "'THOSE ARE THE KILLING GRIEFS,' ETC. 131 Miss Scales, ' if it hadn't been for the money in consols left to Martha. I think my aunt might have left me to provide for Martha and Floss and Fido. I should have taken care they never wanted anything.' 'Perhaps they would rather be able to take care of themselves/ Beatrix had replied, a speech Avhich was not agreeable to Miss Scales. ' But I must ask you/ said Beatrix, as she drove her pony carriage up the moorland road. ' Whom else can I ask ? Have I so many friends ready to give me information ? You must answer me.' ' Ido not recognise any obligation to do so unless I choose, Beatrix/ Miss Scales replied, severely. ' The question you put is a very painful one. I cannot deny that there is an unpleasant feeling about you in people's minds. Your purchasing laudanum at dif ferent shops \u2014 forgive me if I say in an underhand and crafty manner ' ' They would not have given me enough at one shop,' interrupted Beatrix, ' and I was almost mad for want of sleep.' ' My dear, I am not finding fault with you. God"], [140, "132 AN OPEN VERDICT. forbid that I should judge you. But, altogether, the circumstance was most unfortunate, and it has had a painful effect upon people's minds. I am not sure, Beatrix, that it woidd not be well for you to leave Little Yafford.' ' What ! run away from these people because they are cruel enough to believe this hideous thing ? ' cried Beatrix, passionately. ' No, that is a thing I will never do. I will live here till my hair is gray, rather than let them think their false judgment has driven me aAvay.' ' Well, Beatrix, I am very sorry,' said Miss Scales. ' I think a tour in Switzerland \u2014 or a resi- dence in Hanover \u2014 Avhere you might acquire the German language with the best accent \u2014 would be good for you in every way. And, perhaps, before you came back something would transpire to convince people they had misjudged you. However, you must do as you please, of course. I have no authority. Mr. Dulcimer is your guardian. So long as he is satisfied I cannot complain. And now, my dear, with regard to myself, I have been wishing to men tion it for some time, but I did not like to say any-"], [141, "'THOSE ARE THE KILLING GRIEFS,' ETC. 133 thing while your papa's death was so recent. I am going to leave you, and settle in Devonshire.' Beatrix was petrified. She had considered Miss Scales as much a fixture as the old eight-day clock in the hall\u2014 nay, as the Water House itself, or as the massive old bridge with its single arch, which had spanned the river ever since the time of the Romans. Miss Scales was tiresome, and given to much preaching, and to the use of Johnsonian locutions, without the correctness of Johnson. She easily degenerated into a nuisance, but Beatrix was used to her, and regarded her as a part of life. Such fondness as grows out of time and custom, Beatrix had for Miss Scales, though not the affection that springs from merit and sweetness in the object of it. That Miss Scales could wish to remove herself permanently from the Water House was of all things most startling. It was as if the cedar on the lawn had uprooted itself and walked away to shade some other garden. ' Leave me ! ' cried Beatrix, pale with surprise. ' You can't really mean it/ ' Indeed, my dear, I do. My dearest aunt"], [142, "134 AN OPEN VERDICT.

You can have all your mornings free/ ' You cannot suppose that, so long as I remained with you, I could neglect the improvement of your mind, Beatrix/ severely exclaimed Miss Scales, fully believing in her own style of grinding \u2014 quite forty years behind the spirit of the age \u2014 as an improving process. ' No, my dear, that is not the consideration. I want to live in my own house. Dear aunt Judson has left me a bijou cottage at Exmouth, and all her beautiful furniture, and I feel it a duty I owe to myself, after all these years of scholastic toil, to settle down.

' Beatrix, are you trying to murder me ? ' cried the terrified Miss Scales. ' Stop that pony this instant, or I'll take the reins out of j'our hands.' ' If you do that we shall certainly be in the ditch. There, Puck is quiet enough now.' 'As to my liking Floss and Fido better than you,' pursued Miss Scales with her judicial air, when Puck had resumed his accustomed trot, ' that is a very unfair way of putting it. I have my own hap piness to consider.' ' Yes,' said Beatrix, ' that seems the first consi deration with everybody.' 'If we cannot discuss this question without temper, Beatrix ' remonstrated Miss Scales. ' We cannot. At least, I cannot,' answered Bea trix, quickly.

' My dear Beatrix, the parting AA'ill be very pain ful to me ; but it would be more painful to remain.' ' Why ? ' asked Beatrix, fiercely.

' You believe a\\ _at these people believe.' ' I have not said that.' ' No, you would not dare to say it. But you are wicked enough to think it \u2014 you who have known me all my life. This ends everything between us.' ' I should think so/ said Miss Scales. ' I shall pack my trunks to-night, and leave Little Yafford the first thing to-morrow morning.' 'It will be best so,' replied Beatrix, and she turned Puck with a suddenness that swung the chaise"], [145, "' THOSE ARE THE KILLING GRIEFS,' ETC. 137 round in a manner to make Miss Scales a second time in fear of her life. Beatrix droA re home in sdence, went straight to her own room, and shut herself in there. Her own maid, Mary, carried her up some tea, and she sent a message to Miss Scales excusing herself from going down to dinner on the ground of a headache. Had she said a heartache it would have been the truth. Miss Scales eat her dinner in sullen state, medi tating her life of independence with Floss and Fido. She asked Peacock to order a fly for her at a quarter past seven next morning, in time to catch the quarter-past eight London train at Great Yafford. She devoted the evening to packing her trunks, weeding out a few scarecrow odds and ends of finery from the garden of her wardrobe as a parting bequest to Mary. She left the Water House in the early Avinter gray, without having seen Beatrix. Peacock handed her an envelope at the last moment, which she opened presently in the fly. It contained no word of farewell, only bank-notes for the current quarter's salary. This was the first absolute desertion. Beatrix"], [146, "138 AN OPEN VERDICT. felt it heavily. She had been wounded at Bella Scratchell's keeping aloof from her, as she had done since her visit ended. She Avas more deeply wounded by Miss Scales's abandonment. Before the day was out she was to receive another and much heavier blow. A letter was brought her, late in the evening, from Cyrd Culverhouse. It was only the second letter she had ever received from him, but she could have sworn to his hand writing if it had been shown her among a thousand. There is no expert keener-eyed in these things than love. ' At last ! ' she said to herself, with a great wave of joy drowning her heart. That the letter might bring evil tidings never occurred to her. It was hke the leaflet in the beak of the dove. It meant that the dark days Avere ended, and the glad world was beginning to smde upon her again. The letter was long, but she had not read many lines before despair seized her. She uttered no cry or groan.

Mrs. Piper wiped aAvay her tears with the fine hem-stitched cambric that befitted her Avealth and position, and applied herself disconsolately to her smelling-bottle. ' What do you mean ? ' asked Bella, all the pink ness fading out of her cheeks. ' Why, surely you have heard ? ' ' I have heard nothing. Is it about Mr. Culver house ? ' ' My dear, he has left us. He has gone to Bridford \u2014 a horrible place in Lancashire, where they have small-pox every year. You might have knocked me down with a feather when Ebenezer came in and told me about it.' Bella sat pale and speechless. Was it for this that she had schemed ?

' Do you mean that he has really gone/ she faltered presently, ' for ever ? ' ' Yes, my dear, he has left us for a per manency.

His visits buoyed me up/ ' Other people Avill be sorry,' said Bella, faintly. ' Everybody must be sorry. He is a saintly young man/ ' When did he leave ? ' ' Yesterday morning.' ' And I never heard of it,' exclaimed Bella. She was thinking hoAV all things had looked the same, though he was gone. There had been nothing in earth or sky to tell her that the light had faded out of her life. The dull village street \u2014 with her mother's vagabond fowls pecking in the highway \u2014 had looked not a shade duller than usual. She had passed Mrs. Pomfret's trim garden, and had looked tenderly at the square unpretending cottage, thinking that those walls sheltered him ; and he was far away. He Avas gone, and she had not known it. ' He might have called to wish me good-bye,' she complained, 'after my working for his poor.' ' It must have been very sudden at the last,' suggested Mrs. Piper. Bella Avent to the schoolroom to grapple with the"], [153, "' ALAS !

All her misery was Mrs. Dulcimer's fault, she thought, not taking into consideration her own readiness to lend herself to Mrs. Dulcimer's plans. There was only one ray of comfort, a lurid and unholy light, in the dark gulf of her thoughts. If Cyrd had gone away taking her hopes with him, he had left Beatrix also hopeless. There was an end of the tie between those two. If he had meant to marry Miss Harefield he would not have left Little Yafford. She dragged herself through the lesson, somehow, beating time to Elizabeth Fry's performance of the classic melody of Trab, Trab, with somebody's variations \u2014 the variations of an ancient and stereo typed order, first triplets, then little stunted runs, then octaves, then a dismal minor, all in chords, and then a general banging and flare-up for a finale. The piece was hideous, and Ehzabeth Fry's playing was a degree worse than the piece.

Their historical ideas were strictly feudal, and it must have appeared to them only yesterday when the curfew was heard from every church tower, and Peter the Hermit was kindling the souls of Christians with his war-cry of Deus wilt. Bella stopped to see the little Pipers safely through their early dinner, the table of these juvendes being as much a scene of strife and contention as any battle-field in history. It was a hard matter to preserve some semblance of peace, still harder to inculcate anything approaching good manners, the young Pipers having entered the world with an incapacity for using spoons, forks, knives, or other implements of civilized life in a decent manner. The battle-field was generally flooded before dinner was over \u2014 not with the gore of the combatants, but with Brougham's stout, or with Elizabeth's regulation glass of old port, or a sauce boat that had capsized in a struggle to get it ' first/ or a mustard-pot turned over in a free fight.

She was thinking of that ideal vicarage which might have been hers in the future if Cyril Culver house had only cared for her. ' He might have chosen me if his heart had been free,' she reflected. 'Everybody tells me I am pretty ; even Mr. Piper, coarse and common as he is, always compliments me about my looks. Why should not Cyrd have liked me ? ' It seemed a hard thing to Bella that this gift of prettiness should be such a barren boon, that it should not bring her exactly what she wanted. She shed some sullen tears on her way home across the windy Park, along the bleak high road. There Avas no one to see her tears or to pity her. She was angry with fate, angry with hfe, in which all things were so unequally meted out. Beatrix was miserable too, no doubt, in her handsome house yonder, the"], [156, "148 AN OPEN A_RDICT. house whose dulness BeUa had found a shade worse than poverty. Bella changed her dress and bonnet, and went to make an afternoon call upon Mrs. Dulcimer, certain of hearing all about Cyrd's departure from that loquacious lady. The twilight shadows were falling already, and the half-dozen dingy little shops in the vdlage street were dimly illuminated with oil or tallow, but an hour or so before tea was always the best time for finding Mrs. Dulcimer. 'Well, my dear, you have heard the news, I suppose ? ' said the Vicar's wife, dispensing with the usual ' how do d'ye do,' in her eagerness. ' I have, dear Mrs. Dulcimer, and I am so surprised.' ' So is everybody, my dear, Mr. Dulcimer most of all. Such a sudden desertion \u2014 an old pupd too, whom we looked upon almost as a son. I think it positively unkind.

And now her father is dead she is free to marry any one she likes.' Mrs. Dulcimer shook her head with a dismal air, and gave a prolonged sigh. 'Ah, my dear, it is very sad. Those reports!' Bella echoed the sigh. ' I was very fond of her \u2014 once/ she said. ' So was I, Bella. And, even now, I should be the last to condemn her. God forbid that I should judge anybody.

' And I am sorry to say,' she continued, Avith increasing solemnity, ' Rebecca thinks as I do.' ' And Mr. Dulcimer ? ' inquired Bella. ' Oh, Mr. Dulcimer is a very curious man in that respect. He never thinks the same as other people. He is convinced of Beatrix's innocence' and says the Little Yafford people are a set of venomous idiots for condemning her. But say what he wid, he cannot stem the tide of public opinion. The coroner's verdict was so unsatis factory.' ' What does Sir Kenrick think ? ' asked Bella. ' Oh, he and Mr. Dulcimer are of the same opinion.' ' Beatrix is too handsome to be condemned by gentlemen,' said Bella, with unconscious a _nom.

Mr. Dulcimer came in from his afternoon round at this moment. He nodded to Bella, and sank down with a fatigued air in the comfortable arm-chair that always stood ready for him in the snuggest corner of the hearth.

' Miss Coyle is not my bishop,' retorted her husband, ' and if she were I should not consult her as to my choice of guests.' Bella went to the Water House next day.

Mr. Namby came in three times in the course of the day and evening, and was full of anxiety about his patient. He found BeUa sitting quietly by the bedside, ready to assist the faithful maid-servant in nursing her mistress. Mrs. Peters, the fat housekeeper, came in every half hour, and was miserable because her beef tea and calves' foot j eUy were not appreciated by the fever parched invahd. Cyril's- name came more than once from those dry pale lips, whde Bella sat by and listened. His desertion was evidently the blow that had struck home. ' I'm afraid she's heard some of the unkind gossip that's been about, and that it has preyed upon her mind/ said Mr. Namby, in a confidential chat with Miss Scratchell. ' I can't account for her illness in any other way. It's all the mind. Mr. Dulcimer promises to carry her off to the Vicarage directly she is well enough to be moved. That will be a very good thing.

I HAVE NOR HOPE NOR HEALTH.' 155 To Mr. Namby, whose horizon had for the last five-and-thirty years been bounded by the sulky ridge of the moor that shut in Little Yafford, a change from the Water House to the Vicarage seemed a grand thing. And if in the summer his patient could be taken to Scarborough or Harrogate, the cure ought to be complete. Mr. Namby never thought of prescribing the Tyrol or the Engadine. Those places had for him httle more than a tradi tionary or geographical existence, and were only present in his mind as certain wavy lines upon the map.

So one afternoon in windy March, Beatrix was put into the old-fashioned carriage in which her mother had driven during her brief wedded hfe, and Avas conveyed to the Vicarage, there to remain till she should be strong enough to travel. She felt a sensation nearer akin to happiness than she had known for a long time when she found herself seated in the Vicar's firelit hbrary, with a httle old-fashioned tea table by her side, and Rebecca waiting upon her with a cup of strong tea. Rebecca had been talked to seriously by the Vicar, and had seceded in a scan dalously abrupt manner from the Coyle faction. ' Now, Beatrix, this is to be your home as long as you can make yourself happy in it/ said the Vicar. ' The Water House is a very fine old place, but it is damp and dismal, and I don't at all wonder that it made you dl. You are to call this home, and you are to think of me as your father.' 'And you do not believe \u2014 ' faltered Beatrix, and then burst into tears. 'I believe you are a good and noble girl/ said"], [165, "' ALAS ! I HAVE NOR HOPE NOR HEALTH.' 157 the Vicar, cheerily, ' and that a happy and honour able life lies before you.' 'And after all/ he reflected, 'though I detest match-making, it would be no bad thing for that dog Kenrick if he could win this splendid girl for his wife.' That clog Kenrick was still staying, off and on, at the Vicarage. His leave did not expire till the end of April. He had about six weeks before him. He came in presently while Beatrix was sitting in the dimly lighted room sipping her tea. Mr. Dulcimer had been called out into the hall to see a parishioner. There was no one else in the room. ' I am so glad to see you better/ said Kenrick, heartily, planting himself in a chair near Miss Harefield. By that doubtful light he was wonderfuUy like Cyrd. The shock of his entrance \u2014 something in the likeness, as he sat beside her with the fire-glow flickering upon his face, moved Beatrix painfuUy. She could hardly answer him. ' Thank you. I am much better/ she murmured, faintly."], [166, "158 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' But far from well, I am afraid,' he said. ' You seem very weak.' In the next instant her head fell back upon the cushion of the easy chair. She had fainted. Ken rick rang the bed violently for Rebecca. He was not a coxcomb, but he had a very good opinion of himself, and this fainting fit of Beatrix's affected himself curiously. He made up his mind that it Avas he whom she loved, and not Cyrd ; and he made up his mind that he would win her for his Avife."], [167, "CHAPTER XI. ' WHY WAS MY CRESSID THEN SO HARD TO WIN ? ' Slowly and gradually health and strength came back to Beatrix Harefield. The family hfe at the Vicarage was a new thing to her. It was a new thing to live in a house where everybody was cheerful, and where people seemed fond of her. The library was her favourite room, and Mr. Dul cimer her chosen companion. Whether he was silently absorbed in his book, or laid it down, as he did very often, to talk to her, Beatrix found his society all-sufficient. She read and studied at a table he had allotted to her, apart from him, and yet near him. Under his guidance she read the books that filled her mind with the best material; she climbed from height to height upon the hills of knowledge. NeAv worlds opened to her that she had never dreamed of, and she went in and found that there were"], [168, "160 AN OPEN VERDICT. pleasant regions in those strange worlds. Science, which she had only known as a name, opened its treasure-house for her. Art, which she had known almost as vaguely, was revealed to her, with all its mysteries and beauties, unknown to the ignorant. And Poetry, best and sweetest of all, in her mind, opened the door to a fairy-land of inexhaustible delight. She did not forget Cyrd, but she learned to look with a calm disdain upon her mahgners in Little Yafford, and she was almost happy. Before the end of March Mrs. Dulcimer had broken altogether with Miss Coyle, after rebuk ing that ancient sibyl, in no measured phrase, for her want of charity. ' I shall never drop in to tea here again,' said Mrs. Dulcimer. ' No, Miss Coyle, not if we both were to hve for a hundred years.' ' I shall be very sorry for that/ rephed Miss Coyle, sitting very erect behind her oval tea-tray, and with her gaze fixed upon her sdver teapot, marked with King George's pigtad, and an heir loom ; ' but I cannot alter my opinion, even/ with"], [169, "'WHY WAS MY CRESSID SO HARD TO WIN?' 161 a tremulous movement of her cannon cm-Is, ' for the privilege of retaining Mrs. Dulcimer's friend ship.

' Fortunately Miss Harefield does not want to come into your house,' retorted Mrs. Dulcimer, very red and angry, and Avith all her trillings and puffings in agitation. ' Thousands, indeed ! Do you suppose Beatrix Harefield's fortune has any influence Avith Mr. Dulcimer or me ? ' ' I don't presume to speculate upon Mr. Dulcimer's motives or yours, but I beheve the coroner's jury would have come to a very different verdict if Miss Harefield had been poor and a stranger.

' What proof can you bring against her ? ' Enough to hang her if she had been anybody else/ said Miss Coyle. ' Why did she buy that laudanum ? ' ' For her own use.' ' Ah ! ' said Miss Coyle. There is a great deal of meaning in the mono syllable ' Ah !' if it be uttered with a grave shake of the head, a tightening of thin lips, and a pro longation of tone. ' I don't think there is any Christian feeling in Little Yafford,' exclaimed Mrs. Dulcimer, drawing on a tight glove, and bursting it in a ruinous manner. 'Except at the Vicarage/ sneered Miss Coyle ' The place is given over to a pack of prying old maids and spiteful old bachelors.' 'Thank you/ said Miss Coyle, with wither ing sarcasm.' She rose to accompany Mrs. Dulcimer to the door. She was not going to fad in politeness, even to a departing foe."], [171, "' WHY WAS MY CRESSID SO HARD TO AVIN ? ' 163 ' Good afternoon, and good-bye/ said the Vicar's Avife, walking along the httle garden path Avith an air of shaking the dust of Miss Coyle's tene ment from off her shoes. From this time sonvard Mrs. Dulcimer took Beatrix under her wing. She forgot that she too had shared the dark suspicions of Little Yafford. It was in her mind as if those suspicions had never been. She was a woman who lived from hand to mouth. Her ideas were the ideas of to-day; yesterday's convictions went for nothing. She told Rebecca that she was disgusted with the people of Little Yafford for their infamous conduct to Beatrix ; and Rebecca, who, though of too sterling metal to be a time-server, loved to please her mistress, went over to Miss Harefield's party, and defended her stoutly at all kitchen tea parties. And Sir Kenrick \u2014 Sir Kenrick, who had always despised her slanderers, was now Beatrix Hare field's most ardent champion. He had begun by thinking that she would make an admirable mistress of Culverhouse Castle ; he ended by being"], [172, "164 AN OPEN VERDICT. very sure that she would make an adorable wife. He left off fishing for sulky pike in the reedy pools and inlets of the winding river, and spent his days hanging about the Vicarage, idle and happy, and very much in the way of other people's industry. The lynx eyes of Mrs. Dulcimer, trained to see very far into all budding loves, were quick to perceive the state of affairs. She Avas delighted, and forgot that she had ever abandoned her plans for the union of the impo verished Culverhouse estate, and the fat fields and rich pastures of the Harefield property. It seemed to her the realization of her own idea. She took Kenrick's young affection under her protection; she smiled fondly upon the unconscious Beatrix. She was full of Machiavellian schemes for leaving the two young people in each other's society. The end of Kenrick's leave was drawing near. Things were getting desperate, Mrs. Dulcimer thought. It must be now or never. She even went so far as to tell Kenrick so. ' Faint heart never won fair lady/ she said. ' I know she likes you.'"], [173, "'WHY WAS MY CRESSID SO HARD TO WIN?' 165 'I hope you won't think me conceited if I agree with you, but I really think she does/ said Kenrick, remembering that curious fainting fit on the first evening of Miss Harefield's visit. He took heart of grace next day, finding Beatrix alone in the library an hour or so before the late tea. It was a windy afternoon, late in March, the sky dull and gray, the wood fire gloAving redly, Beatrix seated in her low chair beside the hearth, with a book on her lap, deep in thought. ' I don't wonder you admire Pascal,' she said, Avithout looking up, as Kenrick came towards the hearth. ' His is a most delicate Avit.' ' I am sorry to say I don't know anything about the gentleman,' said Kenrick. ' Did he write plays or novels ? ' ' I beg your pardon. I thought you were Mr. Dulcimer.' 'You took me for a better man than I am. All those rows of sober old books are Greek to me \u2014 worse than Greek, for I do know that by sight. I Avonder that you can find so much"], [174, "166 AN OPEN VERDICT. happiness in this dry-as-dust collection of the dear Vicar's.' ' I don't knoAv about happiness,' answered Beatrix, with a faint sigh. ' I find forgetfulness. I suppose that is almost as good.' ' There cannot be much in your young hfe that you can wish to forget,' said Kenrick. ' There is very httle in it that I care to re member.' ' Erase it altogether from your memory then, and begin a new life from to-day,\" said Kenrick, flinging himself head foremost into a gulf of uncertain issues, like the diver who plunges into the fatal deep to win the king's daughter. 'Let the beginning of a brighter and happier life date from to-day. You are one of those floAvers of earth which seem to be born to blush unseen. You, who are so Avorthy of love and admiration, have lived hidden from those avIio could admire and appreciate. But if a real and unmeasured love in the present can compensate for your losses in the past, that love is yours, Beatrix. I love you as I never thought I should love. I did not know that it was in my nature to feel as strongly"], [175, "WHY WAS MY CRESSID SO HARD TO WIN?' 167 as I feel for you. Stop \u2014 do not answer me too quickly,' he cried, reading rejection in her look as she turned to him with the firelight shining on her face. ' You will say, perhaps, \" I am rich and you are poor. How am I to believe in your truth ? \" ' ' I am not capable of thinking meanly of you,' ansAvered Beatrix. ' But you ask me Avhat is impossible. I have made up my mind never to i marry. ' Will you tell me the reason ? ' ' That is my secret.' ' I am not to be answered so easdy, Beatrix. I love you too well to lose you without a struggle. I have spoken too soon, perhaps. I have been too precipitate. But I am to go back to India in a few weeks, and I should hke to return with a new hap piness \u2014 with at least the promise of your love.' ' I have no love to give you. If you could see into the bottom of my heart, you would be horrified at its emptiness. The warmest feehng I have is gratitude to my friends the Dulcimers.

How she was to reign there \u2014 not like his mother, in silence and seclusion, but in all the power of youth, beauty, and wealth, a queen of county society, the centre and focus of a happy world of her own, loved, admired, and revered.

' For God's sake, Beatrix, do not let that foul scandal weigh in your mind. Perhaps that is the reason you reject me,' he added, slow to believe that he had been mistaken when he fancied himself beloved. ' No/ answered Beatrix, ' but the only man I ever loved rejected me for that reason.' ' Oh,' said Kenrick, deeply mortified."], [177, "'WHY WAS MY CRESSID SO HARD TO WIN?' 169 After this confession he could no longer doubt that he had mistaken Beatrix's feelings towards him. He Avas silent for some minutes, and then he ex claimed suddenly, \u2014 ' That man was my cousin Cyril ? ' ' He was.' ' Then my cousin Cyrd is a mean hound.' ' Do you want me to hate you ?

' It ready seems as if no plan of mine is to succeed.' Beatrix did not appear at the tea-table. She sent an apology by Rebecca. She had a headache, and Avould go to bed early. Kenrick was absent-minded, and out of spirits. The meal, usually so cheerful, Avas eaten in sdence ; Mr. Dulcimer had picked up a queer little seventeenth century copy of Bodeau at Great Yafford that morning, and looked at the tad pieces and initials as he took his tea. ' Stop and smoke your cigar here, Ken/ said Mrs. Dulcimer Avhen tea was over, and Sir Kenrick Avas about to fodoAv his host to the library. ' But don't you dislike smoke in this room ?

He told Mrs. Dul cimer everything. 'Something must be done,' she said finaUy, and she made up her mind that she, Selina Dulcimer, was the right person to undertake the task."], [184, "CHAPTER XII.

Before Sir Kenrick's leave came to an end Mrs. Piper had gone to the land Avhere there are no sordid cares, no gnawing doubts as to the honesty of ser vants, no heart-corroding regrets at the Avastefulness and expenditure of a large household. Mrs. Piper had gone to that undiscovered country where we may fairly hope that for those who have lived harmlessly upon earth all is peace. Mi-. Piper drove his smart little pony cart about the country roads and through the village street as usual, but he wore an altered countenance and crape to the top of his tall hat. He no longer had a noisy greeting for every one, no longer quoted Jeremy Bentham or William Cobbett. Never was Avidower more disconsolate than Ebenezer Piper. Honestly and truly he mourned the careful partner of his youth and maturity.

Mrs. Piper's monument was to be the glory of the village churchyard. Mr. Dulcimer was too in dulgent and easy to insist upon a rigid \u00e6stheticism in the memorials which the hving erected in honour of the dead. There was a good deal of bad taste in God's Acre at Little Yafford, but Mr. Piper Avas des tined to put the cap on the edifice by the gaudiest and most expensive mausoleum that ever the chief stonemason of Great Yafford had devised or exe cuted. It was to be a sarcophagus of the jeAvel casket shape, with four twisted columns, like candle sticks, at the corners, and a tall urn surmounting the lid. Each of the columns Avas of a different coloured marble, the urn was dark red serpen tine, with a malachite serpent coded round it.

Altogether the monument Avas to be a Avon derful tiling, and Mr. Piper felt a pride in con templating the sketches which the mason had caused to be made, and in picturing to himself the effect of the whole when this great work of art should be finished. The Piper chddren, in black frocks, and in a state of semi-orphanage, Avere a little more trouble some than they had been in coloured frocks, and with an invalid mamma as a court of appeal. They brought the ghost of their lost parent into every argument. ' I'm sure ma Avouldn't have wished me to learn three verbs in one morning,' said Elizabeth Fry.

Bella and Beatrix were good friends still, but not such friends as they had been a year br even six months ago. There was a restraint on both sides. Beatrix could not have told why it was, but it seemed to her that there was a change in herself, and a stdl greater change in Bella. Bella knew very well what it was that made her uncomfortable in Miss Harefield's society. It was the sealed letter in its hiding-place in Bella's shabby old bedroom. That sealed letter weighed like a load of hon upon Bella's conscience Avhen she found herself in Beatrix's company ; and yet she was glad that she had done this thing, if it had been the means of parting Cyrd and Beatrix. She would like to have seen them parted even more irrevocably, so that under no circumstances could time or chance bring them together again. She was in this temper of mind when she went to spend the evening at the Vicarage, after her little talk with Mr. Piper in the stone portico at the Park."], [191, "183 SOMETHING MUST BE DONE. It was about a Week since Sir Kenrick had made his offer and had been rejected. He had Uken a wonderful fancy to fishing for pike after that catastrophe, and had brought home some very handsome specimens of that rave_ous tribe, for the Vicarage cook to stuff and bake, and serve with savoury sauces for the three o'clock dinner. ' I think I shall have to protest, like the highland gillies when they got too much salmon, if Kenrick goes on bringing home pike in this way,' said Mr. Dulcimer, when the cover was lifted and the hungry-jawed scaly monster appeared before him. Kenrick was off in the early gray to his fishing grounds, so he and Beatrix only met of an evening. He Avas very polite to her, and evidently bore no malice. Hope was not altogether extinguished in his breast. He had much confidence in Mrs. Dulcimer, who had said that something must be done. Kenrick had not the faintest idea what this inveterate match maker meant to do, but he felt that her friendship Avould stick at nothing which a clergyman's wife might do without peril to her soul. 'Bella,' said Mrs. Dulcimer after tea, ' I want to"], [192, "184 AN OPEN VERDICT. show you the things I've made for the missionary basket. You might be able to help me a little, perhaps.' 'I shall be delighted, dear Mrs. Dulcimer,' answered Bella, inwardly lamenting that it had pleased God to call her to that station of life in Avhich her friends always felt themselves justified in asking her to work for them. A young woman of fortune like Miss Harefield might be as idle or as selfish as she pleased. Nobody ever thought of asking for payment in kind for any favour they showed her ; but everybody who did any kindness to penniless Bella Scratchell wanted to extort recompense for his or her civdity in needle- Avork or some sort of drudgery. ' Come up to my room and look at the things, dear,' said Mrs. Dulcimer; and then it occurred to Bella that her hostess had something particular to say to her. She had heard from Cyril that day, perhaps, or had got news of him by a side wind. Bella's heart beat ever so fast at the idea. They went up to Mrs. Dulcimer's bedroom, a large old-fashioned chamber, with an immense four-"], [193, "185 SOMETHING MUST BE DONE. post bedstead and flowery chintz curtains, a muslin draped dressing-table, adorned with a great many china pots, and a pin-cushion that Avas a noteworthy feature.

' cried Mrs. Dulcimer. ' There's no think ing about it. They Avere made for each other.' Mrs. Dulcimer's couples always were made for each other. It is odd how many of them turned out misfits. Bella Avas reflecting that if Beatrix were happily married to Sir Kenrick Culverhouse, her sin about the sealed letter would Aveigh less heavily on her conscience \u2014 or, indeed, need not Aveigh at all. What can any one ask more than happiness ? And, in the eye of the world, Kenrick was a much more suitable husband for a. young woman of fortune than Cyril could possibly be. ' Now I have been thinking,' continued Mrs. Dulcimer, sinking to a mysterious undertone, ' that perhaps if Beatrix could be made to think that Cyid was fickle and inconstant, and that before he left Little Yafford he had got to care for someone else \u2014 you,"], [195, "187 SOMETHING MUST BE DONE. for instance/ whispered Mrs. Dulcimer, making a httle stab at Bella Avith her forefinger, ' it might cure her of her foolish attachment to him.

If she could only be made to think that Cyrd was fond of you, Bella, without actual false hood/ concluded Mrs. Dulcimer, with a strong em phasis upon the qualifying adjective, as much as to say that in so good a cause she would not mind sailing rather near the wind. ' I'm sure I don't know how it is to be done,' said Bella, with a meditative air. ' Beatrix is so self-opinionated. It is not as if she were a weak minded pliable girl. She is as hard as rock.' ' But you are so clever, Bella. You could manage anything. If I were to say now that I always thought Cyrd was very fond of you \u2014 and I did think so for a long time, as you know, dear \u2014 and if you were to say something that would sustain that idea.

' Indeed no, my love. I know how truthful you are. Thus it was agreed between the Vicar's wife and her ductde protegee that, somehow or other, Beatrix was to be persuaded that her lover had been doubly false to her ; false in abandoning her because evil tongues maligned her, false in preferring another woman."], [197, "CHAPTER XIII. 'A SMILE OF THINE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' By what serpentine twists and windings Bella Scratchell reached the end she had in view need not be recorded. She was by nature a creature of many curves, and all her progress in life was devious and indirect. Enough that she succeeded in making Beatrix Harefield believe her lost lover false and fickle, and thus undermined the girl's respect for the man aa_o had renounced her. So long as Beatrix could believe that Cyril had sacrificed his heart's desire to his duty as priest and teacher, she would have continued to reverence and love him. Present or absent, he would have remained the one central figure in her life. From the moment she Avas per suaded to think him the shallow lover of a day \u2014 or indeed, worse than this, a lover who had been draAvn to her by the lure of her wealth, and who at the"], [198, "190 AN OPEN A'ERDICT. bottom of his heart had always preferred Bella's lilies and roses \u2014 from that moment she despised him, and concentrated all the forces of her mind in the endeavour to forget him. ' I will never pray for him or his work again,' she vowed to herself, and the vow had all the savagery of a pagan oath. ' His name shall never pass my lips or find a place in my heart. It shall be to me as if such a man had never lived.' From this time there was a marked change in her manner. It was brighter, gayer, harder than it had been before. That mournful resignation which had distinguished her since her father's death gave place to a proud indifference, a careless scorn of all things and all men, save the few friends she liked and trusted. That disgust of life which attacks most of us at odd times, and which sometimes afflicts even the young, had seized upon her. All things in this world were hateful to her. Solomon, sated with wealth and glory, could not have felt the emptiness of earthly joys more deeply than this girl of nine teen, whose lips had scarcely touched the cup of hfe. She knew herself rich, and with all good things at"], [199, "'A SMILE OF THINE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' 191 her disposal \u2014 beautiful enough to command the love of men ; and yet, because that one man whom she loved had proved false and unworthy, she turned Avith a sickened soul from all that earth held of hope or pleasure. Unhappdy she had not yet learned to look higher for comfort. She Avas not irreligious. She firmly believed ad her Church taught her to believe, but she had not learned, like Hezekiah, to lay her trouble before the Lord. She locked up her grief in her own heart, as something apart from her spiritual life ; and she Avent on conforming outwardly to all the duties of religion, but deriving no inward solace from her faith. Beatrix was in this mood when Mrs. Dulcimer, delighted at Bella's speedy success, but opining, nevertheless, that something more must be done, was seized with a happy idea. 'Kenrick,' she exclaimed at tea one evening, when Kenrick had announced his intention of going to have one more peep at Culverhouse Castle before he embarked on board the P. and 0. steamship that was to carry him on the first stage of his journey to India \u2014 ' Kenrick/ cried Mrs. Dulcimer, with an ex-"], [200, "192 AN OPEN VERDICT. cited air, ' I really think it is the oddest thing in the Avorld.' 'What, dear Mrs. Dulcimer?' asked Kenrick, Avhde everybody else looked curious. ' Why, that after knowing you all these years, and hearing you talk so much about Culverhouse Castle, we should never have seen it.' ' I don't knoAv whom you mean by Ave,' said Mr. Dulcimer, ' but I beg to say that I spent three weeks at Culverhouse in one of _iy long vacations, and a capital time I had there. The Avon is one of the finest salmon rivers I ever fished in.' ' Ah, that was in Kenrick's father's time,' said Mrs. Dulcimer ; ' but though you may be perfectly quainted with the place, Clement, I have never seen it.' ' That is your own fault,' exclaimed Kenrick. ' Nothing would make me happier than to receive you there. It would be something in the style of the famous reception at Wolfs Crag, perhaps, espe cially if it were in the close time for salmon ; but you should have a hearty welcome, and I shouldn't feel my position so keenly as the Master of Ravens- Avood felt his.'"], [201, "'A SMILE OF THINE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' 193 ' There would be no Lucy Ashton in the case,' put in the Vicar, innocently. ' And should we really not put you out if we came ? ' asked Mrs. Dulcimer. ' Not the least in the world. You would have to live as plainly as Eton boys, that is all. My housekeeper can roast a joint and bod a potato. I think she might even manage a bit of fish, and a rhubarb tart. We would not quite starve you, and I know you would be charmed with the dear old place ; but if you are coming you must make up your minds very quickly. My time is up on the 24th.' ' We could make up our minds in half an hour, if Clement would consent/ answered Mrs. Dulcimer, ' It would be such a delightful change for Beatrix. Mr. Namby has been recommending her a change of air and scene for ever so long ; and it is much too cold for the sea-side. A week in Hampshire would do her a world of good.' | Pray do not think of me,' said Beatrix, ' I had rather go home while you are away.' ' I thought this was your home now, Beatrix remonstrated the Vicar. VOL. II. 0"], [202, "194 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' It is the only house that has ever seemed like home,' the heiress answered, sadly. ' Of course you will go with us, if we go/ ex claimed Mrs. Didcimer. 'You are our adopted daughter, and we expect you to go everywhere with us. We don't even consult you. It is quite a matter of course. I have set my heart on seeing Culverhouse Castle, and the visit will be the very thing to do you good. I am sure Mr. Namby would say so if I asked him about it. So, Clement dear, if you would let Mr. Rodger do duty for just one Sunday, we might spend ten days at Culverhouse very easily.' Mr. Rodger was the new curate, a painstaking youth, with sandy hah and a large round face like the setting sun. Mr. Dulcimer Avas at first disinclined to listen to his wife's suggestions. The journey was long and expensive, and there seemed to be no justifiable reason for undertaking it ; but the Vicar was an in dulgent husband, and he was very fond of salmon fishing, so the discussion ended by his gi-ving his consent, and it was arranged that he and the two"], [203, "'A SMILE OF THINE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' 195 ladies should join Sir Kenrick at the castle two days after the young man's arrival there. Beatrix consented to go to Culverhouse, just as she would have consented to go to Buxton, Harro gate, or Scarborough, if Mrs. Dulcimer had wished her to go there. That disgust of life which had taken possession of her, since the overthrow of her faith in Cyril, left her indifferent to all things. She let her maid pack a portmanteau, and get all things ready for the journey. The girl, Mary, who had waited upon her at the Water House, had accompanied her to the Vicarage. She was not an accomplished attendant, but she was faithful, and Beatrix liked her. Culverhouse Castle was six miles from a rad way station ; one of its chief merits, as Kenrick asserted proudly. He was standing on the plat form when the train arrived, and received his guests with as much enthusiasm as if he had not seen them for a year or so. He had a carriage ready to drive them across to Culverhouse. It was a lovely drive in the spring evening, the sun setting behind the wooded hills, and all the"], [204, "196 AN OPEN VERDICT. soft rustic scene steeped in warm yellow hght. Culverhouse was on the edge of the New Forest, and the road from the station to the castle went through a region of alternate pasture and woodland. Meadows and banks were yellow with primroses ; the earhest ferns were showing their tender green ; the dog-violets shone like jewels amongst the grass ; and the woods were full of white wind-flowers that shivered at every whisper of the April breeze. To Beatrix it ad seemed very lovely. She breathed more freely in this unknown world, where nobody had ever spoken evd of her. There was an infinite relief in having left Little Yafford. When Culverhouse Castle rose before them on the other side of the river, Beatrix thought it the loveliest place she had ever seen. The AAron widened to a smooth lake, and beyond it rose the grave old Gothic towers, like a castle in a fairy tale. Beatrix turned to Kenrick, with the kindest smile she had ever bestowed upon him. ' It is a deheious old place,' she exclaimed. ' I cannot wonder that you are proud of it.' Kenrick was delighted. His face glowed with"], [205, "' A SMILE OF THINE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' 197 pride of race and love for the house of his birth. They were driving through the little village street, ah the old men and women, young men and maidens, doing them obeisance as they passed. Then they crossed the bridge and drove under the gateway, which was a couple of centuries older than the castle itself, and a minute later Kenrick passed into the banquet-hall of his ancestors, with Beatrix on his arm. He had offered his arm to Mrs. Dulcimer, but that match-making matron had bidden him take care of Miss Harefield, so he had the happiness of leading Beatrix across the threshold. ' Jest as if they'd been married and he'd been a-bringin' she home,' old Betsy Mopson said after wards to her husband, gardener and man-of-all work. ' Her be a rare beauty, her be.' Kenrick had done wonders in his two days of preparation. He had got in a brace of apple-faced young women, from the village, one a housemaid out of place, the other her younger sister, still on her promotion, but ready to do anything she was bidden. The old rooms had been furbished up. Traces of decay were still visible in every part"], [206, "198 AN OPEN VERDICT. of the house, but dust and cobwebs had been swept away, and a general air of freshness and purity pervaded the good old rooms. Beatrix was enraptured with everything. She seemed to forget her sorrows amidst these new surroundings. Her life had been spent in a prison house, and this first taste of liberty was sweet. After all, perhaps, even for her, deserted and cast off by the one man she had ever loved, hfe held something worth having. Kenrick led his young guest all round the ruins next morning, before breakfast. They were both early risers, and had found each other in the garden before Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer had left their rooms. They went into the cloistered quadrangle, Avhere the roses flourished in summer time, and where now the wallflowers flashed golden and ruby upon the old gray stones, with colours as vivid as the stained glass that had once filled the place with rainbow hght. Kenrick showed Beatrix the plan of the vanished abbey \u2014 the nave here, the transept there, the chancel and apse beyond. Everything was indicated by stones"], [207, "A SMILE OF THINE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' 199 embedded at intervals in the close-cropped turf, where the sheep browsed happdy, unconscious of the sanctified splendour that had preceded them, the white-robed choir, and swinging censers, the banners and jewelled crosiers that had passed be neath the Gothic arches which had once spanned that fair pasture. Kenrick seemed as sorry for the evanishment of the abbey as if he had been a papist of the deepest dye. ' It is dreadful to think that a great part of the house is built out of the abbey stones,' he said. 'I sometimes wonder it doesn't tumble on our heads. But tradition says the monks of Culverhouse were lazy and ignorant, and that there was only one book, an ancient treatise upon Hunting and Fishing, found ;in this abode of monastic learning, when its treasures were confiscated.' Beatrix had explored every inch of the grounds before the long-disused gong, which in days past had called poor lonely Lady Culverhouse to her anchorite repasts, sounded hoarsely from the hall. Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer were standing in the"], [208, "200 AN OPEN VERDICT porch, scenting the morning ah, when Kenrick and his companion went in. ' How well the dear girl looks ! ' said the Vicar's wife ; ' the change has done her good already. You are enjoying Culverhouse, are you not, Beatrix ? ' ' I am very glad to be away from Little Yafford,' Beatrix answered, frankly. ' In that case you ought never to go back,' said Kenrick. ' What a selfish remark ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Dul cimer, hypocritically. ' How do you suppose I am to exist without Beatrix, after having had her as my adopted daughter for the last three months ? ' ' What do you think of the weather for salmon fishing ? ' asked the Vicar, contemplating the bright blue sky with a discontented look that was hardly becoming in a Christian. ' We coidd do with a httle more cloud, couldn't we, Ken ? But, as time is short, we must make the best of things. I shall expect you to set off with me directly after breakfast.'"], [209, "' A SMILE OF THINE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' 201 ' I shad be delighted/ answered Kenrick ; but he did not mean to give up his day to salmon fishing. He contrived to set the Vicar going, in a spot where there was every chance of good sport, and then, under the pretence of having orders to give about the dinner, ran home across the low-lying water meadows like a boy let loose from school. He found Mrs. Dulcimer expounding the chief features of the mansion \u2014 which she had never seen before \u2014 to Beatrix, whde Betty Mopson stood by in attendance upon them, and made a running commentary, in a Hampshire dialect, which was like a foreign language to the strangers from the north. 'Hah! Lady Culverhouse wur a good 'ooman,' said Mrs. Mopson. ' Thur bean't many like she. This be the room where hur died. Her wur a rale lady. And Sir Kenrick, him takes after she.' Kenrick came in time to hear his praises. He sent Betty back to her kitchen. 'We shall not get a decent luncheon if you waste all your morning chattering here, Betty,'"], [210, "202 AN OPEN VERDICT. he said, and Betty departed, grinning and ducking, and with a fixed idea that the young lady with the dark ' haiyur/ was to be the next Lady Cul verhouse. Kenrick spent a happy day in attendance upon the two ladies. He forgot everything, in the in toxicating delight of the present, forgot that this holiday in life was to be of the briefest, and that a fortnight hence he was to be tossing off Gibraltar in a Peninsular and Oriental steamer. Beatrix seemed happy also, or, at least, she appeared to be in a condition of placid contentment which was not unpromising. The Vicar was successful with his rod, and came home radiant. Betty Mopson had surpassed herself in the preparation of a substantial English dinner. Everything went smoothly and well with Sir Kenrick. Next day he carried off his guests to see some of the lions of the neighbourhood \u2014 a fine old abbey church sorely neglected \u2014 a castle where luckless King Charles had spent a night in safe keeping. Beatrix, Avho felt the unreasoning pity which all"], [211, "' A SMILE OF THTNE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' 203 young and generous minds feel for that weak-minded and dl-used Stuart, contemplated the gloomy stone walls as if they had witnessed the heroic doom of an early Christian martyr. Then came the long drive home, through the spring twihght, across woods which were like glimpses of Paradise. So the week wore on, in simple pleasures which might have seemed tame and dull to those Avorld weary spirits of the Sir Charles Coldstream cahbre, Avho haA'e done everything, and found emptiness everywhere, but which were sweet and new to Beatrix Harefield. A faint bloom began to warm her clear olive cheek, the dark depths of her Italian eyes shone with a new light. Yet she had not forgotten Cyrd Culverhouse, nor one drop in the bitter cup she had drained since her father's death. One evening after dinner, while the golden glow was stdl warm in the west, Beatrix and her host found themselves alone together in the cloistered garden. Untd this moment Kenrick had not said one word about his disappointed hopes. His conduct had been perfect. He had"], [212, "204 AN OPEN VERDICT. been fuU of flattering attentions for his young guest ; he had anticipated her every wish, de voted every free moment of his day to paying her homage; but he had never put on the air of a lover, nor insinuated a hope that could alarm her with the idea that Culverhouse Castle was a trap in which she was to be caught unawares. He had his views and his hopes all the same, in spite of her unqualified rejection a few weeks ago. And now 'she had been a guest in his house nearly a fortnight, and she seemed happier and brighter than he had ever known her. His brief span of delight was nearly at an end.

His chances"], [213, "' A SMILE OF THINE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' 205 of being quite alone with Beatrix were few, and this opportunity, which came by accident, might be the last. However it was, he resolved to cast the die. This time he told no long story about his love. He had said his say that March afternoon in the Vicarage hbrary. He only took Beatrix by the hand as they stood idly side by side, looking down at the wallflowers and polyanthuses growing among the old gray stones \u2014 the capitals and bases of columns that had fallen long ago, and said earnestly, \u2014 ' Beatrix, I want you to be mistress of this place. I will not say another word about my love for you. I will not ask for your love.

Kind as the people here are to me, I dare say there is not one among them who does not knoAv that I have been suspected of poisoning my father.' The pained look in her face told Kenrick hoAV bitter this thought was, and hoAV ever present in her mind. ' They know nothing except that you are the loveliest and noblest of women,' said Kenrick. ' My love, my love, do not reject me. You can give me fortune to restore the glory of a good old name \u2014 to bring back to this place the pride and hospitality and usefulness of days gone by \u2014 and I can give you nothing in exchange, save love and reverence. It is hardly a fair bargain, per haps ; yet I am bold enough to press my suit, for I believe that you and I could be happy together.' After a pause of a few minutes, and a long drawn sigh, Beatrix answered him with a sweet seriousness that to him seemed simply adorable. 'I had my dream of a very different life/"], [215, "' A SMILE OF THINE SHALL MAKE MY BLISS.' 207 she said, 'but that dream was rudely broken.

If you can be content with liking and gratitude, I am content to be your wife/ There was a tone of resignation rather than happiness in this acceptance, but it lifted Kenrick into the seventh heaven of dehght. ' Dearest, you have made me almost mad with joy,' he cried. ' You shall never regret \u2014 no, love, God helping me, you shall never regret your sweet consent of this blissful evening.' He drew her to his heart, and kissed the tremulous lips, which shrank from him with an involuntary recod. How cold those lips were !

He had given himself scanty rest or respite at Little Yafford, though it Avas a place where most curates would have taken life easdy ; but at Bridford he learned, for the first time, what work means in an overcrowded, sorely neglected manufacturing town. The ignorances and abuses which he found rampant in those noisome back slums and overcrowded alleys, lying hidden behind the outward respectability of the high street, aroused his indignation against a system that allowed such things to be. He was no democrat ; he had no sympathy with would-be levellers; but it seemed to him that there must be something out of joint in the time, when such depths of social degradation were left to their native gloom, whde the gaslit"], [217, "' OH, BREAK, MY HEART ! ' 209 thoroughfare and the shriek of the railway engine testified to the march of improvement. Soon after the arrival of Cyril Culverhouse at Bridford, the respectable inhabitants were startled by a series of letters in their leading newspaper, letters characterized by that noble eloquence which comes straight from a heart moved to indignation by the wrongs and sufferings of others. No man could feel his own griefs so keenly as this anony- mous writer felt the miseries of his fellow-towns- men. With an unflinching hand he tore aside the curtain from those dens of infamy and ignorance which the citizens of Bridford were willing to ignore, or to speak of with a deprecating shrug, and an admission that Bridford was a very bad place. It had never occurred to anybody that it was his business to make the place better. No modern Peter the Hermit had arisen to cad for a crusade against ignorance and vice.

But it was not with his pen alone that Cyrd worked. Wherever the state of things was worst he Avas oftenest to be found. That tall erect figure of his grew to be as familiar in the alleys and back slums of Bridford as the hawker with his stale and damaged wares, or the drunken factory hand reeling home after dark. Wherever he Avent he did good. He, whose voice had been grave and gentle at Little Yafford, here spoke in tones of thunder. He was fearless in reprobation\" of brutish cruelty and besotted self-indulgence. He Avas tender and compassionate as a woman to the weak and oppressed, the women and children. First he made himself feared, and then he made himself loved. Even the men \u2014 the burly hardened sinners \u2014 to whom he spoke home truths unflinchingly, \u2014 even these ended by liking him. ' I loike 'im 'cos he ain't afeared on us/ said one"], [219, "' OH, BREAK, MY HEART !

The parish church at Bridford Avas only just big enough for a highly respectable congregation, people who had 'top hats' and best bonnets, and who came to church regularly eA'ery Sunday because it was the right thing to do, and dissected their neighbours' characters afterwards on their way home. Here Cyril felt the rough denizens of the slums and alleys were not wanted. There Avas no room for them. They would have been put to shame by the best bonnets and the sleek broadcloth. He did at first try to get them to go to church on a Sunday evening. He organized week-day evening services, and in struction classes. But even from these the factory people hung back. The old parish church, Avith its shining oaken peAvs and brass chandeliers, was too grand for them. Then Cyril took round the hat among the wealthy manufacturing families, some of whom had been roused by those stirring letters in"], [220, "212 AN OPEN VERDICT. the newspapers, and collected funds for a mission chapel. He began in a very humble way, by fitting up a large room that had once been a coffee-house, but had languished for want of appreciation, the community leaning to stronger liquor than tea or coffee. Here he had services and instruction classes four times a Aveek, thinly attended at first ; but by and-bye the room came to be filled to overflowing, and Cyril began to think of budding a chapel. He had got thus far, Avorking night and day, shutting out of his mind as much as possible all thoughts of himself, and the hopes that he had cherished and renounced, when he received a letter from his cousin Kenrick, Avhich gave him more pain than anything that had ever happened to him ; except Christian Harefield's death, and the train of circumstances attending upon it.

There never was man born who doubted his power to win a Avoman's love. The Vicar and his wife Avere both anxious that Beatrix should remain at the Vicarage, but Beatrix had made up her mind that she ought to go back to the Water House. The old servants were all there ; nothing had been altered since her father's death. ' I shall be tranquil and happy there/ she argued, Avhen Mrs. Dulcimer tried to persuade her that she would be miserable. ' I shah have my books and piano, and shall work hard, and I shall be free to come and see you as often as you care to have me.' ' That Avould be ahvays/ exclaimed Mrs. Dul cimer, Avho had been rapturously fond of Beatrix ever since the success of her matrimonial scheme. ' But, my love, you cannot possibly hve alone. People would talk.' Beatrix shuddered. Young as she was, she had had bitter experience of the power of evd tongues. ' I suppose I must have Avhat Thackeray calls a sheep dog,' she said.

Clement would never have thought of it ; but I saw from the very first that you and Kenrick Avere made for each other.' Mrs. Dulcimer could not refrain from these little gushes of self-gratulation. This engagement of Sir Kenrick and the heiress was the first grand success that had come out of all her match-making She had brought a good many couples together, occasion ally for better, and often for worse ; but she had never before made such a match as this.

Beatrix answered not a A\\'ord. She Avas ahvays grave and silent when the absent Kenrick was talked about. Her heart could not respond to Mrs. Dul cimer's raptures. She liked Kenrick, and believed him noble and disinterested; but betAveen such liking and glad unreasoning love there is a Avide gulf. ' Yes, my dear,' pursued Mrs. Dulcimer, ' if you are obstinately bent on living at the Water House, you must have a person of middle age for your com- panion.' ' Then I should like a Frenchwoman who could not understand one word of English,' said Beatrix. She had her reason for this strange desire. She remembered how Miss Scales's heart, or that piece of mechanism which does duty for a heart in the Scales tribe, had been set against her by the slanderous gossip of Little Yafford. Her new companion must be some one who could not talk or be talked to. The knowledge of foreign tongues at Little Yafford was happily at a minimum. Beatrix knew of no one ex cept Bella Scratchell who could have spoken half a dozen sentences in decent French."], [229, "AM I NOT NOBLER THROUGH THY LOVE ? 221 ' You would like to improve yourself in the lan guage,' said Mrs. Dulcimer. She always called French ' the language.' ' Wed, dear, we must put an advertisement in the Times ; but I'm afraid it Avdl be difficult to get the superior kind of person to whom Ave could entrust you. Of course Ave must state that unexceptionable references Avdl be required.' The advertisement appeared, and brought a shower of letters upon Mrs. Dulcimer, giving occa sion to much consultation between her and Beatrix, but among them all there was only one letter that gave Beatrix an agreeable idea of the Avriter. This came from a lady who had only just come to England, a chddless widow, whose husband, a provincial journalist, had lately died, and left her in reduced circumstances, and who had come to London to try to make some use of her literary talents, only to find that literary talents were a drug in the market. Beatrix liked the letter. The lady's references were satisfactory ; so, after a little time lost in nego tiation, Madame Leonard was engaged, and in due course appeared at the Water House. Her appearance was not unpleasing to Beatrix."], [230, "222 AN OPEN VERDICT. She was a little Avoman, with light brown hair and dark brown eyes, small hands and feet. She was neatly dressed in black, and had the manners of a lady. Since society insisted upon her having a com panion, Beatrix felt that she could get on as well with Madame Leonard as with anybody else ; and Madame Leonard, who was evidently of a soft and affectionate nature, seemed delighted with Beatrix. And now the Water House revived and bright ened a little, and cast off the gloomy mantle that had hung over it through the last ten years of Christian Harefield's life. Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer were often there. Bella Scratchell came and went as she pleased. Mr. and Mrs. Scratchell were invited to dinner occasionally, a condescension on Miss Harefield's part which almost overcame the hard- Avorked lawyer's wife. It was a great privilege, no doubt, to visit at the Water House, but it involved fearful struggles beforehand in order to arrive at a toilette which should be worthy of the occasion. There was always something wanting, which it required all Bella's ingenuity to supply ; and even Avhen a happy result had been accomplished, poor"], [231, "AM I NOT NOBLER THROUGH THY LOVE ? 223 Mrs. Scratchell was not quite easy in her mind. She was so unaccustomed to dine out that she fancied some dreadful catastrophe must needs occur in her absence. The kitchen boiler might burst, or one of the smaller chddren might tumble into the fire, or scald himself Avith the kettle. That kettle was on Mrs. Scratchell's mind all the evening, even when she was smiling her company smile, and pre tending to look at the engravings of Continental landscapes which Beatrix showed her after dinner. Even the Bay of Naples could not make her happy. Vesuvius reminded her too painfully of the kitchen boder. Beatrix found Madame Leonard a much more pleasant companion than Miss Scales. She was well read in her own language, and opened the wide world of classic and modern French hterature to her pupd. They read together for hours, each taking her turn at reading aloud, and occupying herself in the interval with those delicate fancy works which women love. Beatrix had let light and air into her mother's long unused rooms, and had taken possession of"], [232, "224 AN OPEN VERDICT. them for her own occupation. Nothing was dis turbed. The daughter respected every detail of the rooms in which her mother had lived. It was her dehght to keep all things exactly as Mrs. Harefield had left them. So life went on, smoothly enough. Beatrix had no friends but the Dulcimers and the Scratchells. She carefully avoided all the ' best people ' of Little Yafford, and received with a chdling reserve any advances that were made to her. To those whom she happened to meet at the Vicarage she was coldly civil, and that was all. If the Little Yaffordites were inclined to change their opinion about her, she gave no encouragement to any tardy gush of friend liness. She lived among them, but\" was not of them. Miss Coyle retained her original views of Miss Harefield's character. Although strictly conserva tive by profession, as became a lady of ancient famdy, Miss Coyle had that kind of .radicalism which consists in detesting every one better off than herself. She cherished a savage hatred of Beatrix, considering it an injustice in the distribution of wealth and power that a young woman of twenty"], [233, "AM I NOT NOBLER THROUGH THY LOVE ? 225 should have ten thousand a year, and a fine old mansion at her sole disposal, whde she, Dulcinea Coyle, should be cabined, cribbed, and confined in a cottage hardly big enough for a dovecote. True that the cottage was pretty, and that Miss Coyle was fond and proud of it ; but she would have been fonder and prouder of the Water House. Then Miss Coyle's income, being of that strictly limited order which renders the outlay of every sixpence a matter demanding foresight and careful calculation, natu rally gave rise to comparisons Avith the revenue of Miss Harefield, which was large enough for the Avildest extravagance. This sense of a wrong adjustment of fortune, together with the fact of Mrs. Dulcimer's desertion, rankled in Miss Coyle's breast, and whereas other people in Little Yafford had left off talking otjihink ing about Christian Harefield's daughter, Miss Coyle continued to think about her, and took every con venient occasion of talking. She was not even inclined to let Miss Hare field's companion go free. She happened to meet Madame Leonard one afternoon at the house of VOL. II. Q"], [234, "226 AN OPEN VERDICT. Mrs. Scratchell, whom it was her custom to honour once or twice a year with a patronizing call. This was too good an opportunity to be lost. Miss Coyle rather prided herself on her acquaintance with the French language, in which she had been thoroughly 'grounded' five-and-forty years ago at an expensive boarding school. A good deal of the ground had given way during those forty-five years, but Miss Coyle did not know that. She was not at all afraid of addressing Madame Leonard, who had been carrying on a friendly conversation with Mrs. Scratchell, with the aid of a little interpretation by Bella. Miss Coyle contrived to leave the Scratchell domicile in company with Madame Leonard. 'Je marcherai avec vous si vous n'avez pas d'objection,' began Miss Coyle, politely. Madame Leonard declared that she would be charmed, ravished. Her manner implied that Miss Coyle's society was the one delight that she had longed for ever since her arrival in Little Yafford. ' Comment est Mademoiselle Harefield ? ' asked Miss Coyle."], [235, "AM I NOT NOBLER THROUGH THY LOVE ? 22? Madame Leonard looked mystified. A stupid person evidently, Miss Coyle thought. ' Vous es la nouveau gouvernesse de Mademoi selle, n'est ce pas ? ' ' Mais, oui, Madame, je suis heureuse de me nommer sa dame de compagnie.' ' Comment est elle ? Est elle plus facile dans son esprit ? ' Madame Leonard looked at a loss to compre hend this question. 'The woman doesn't understand her own language,' thought Miss Coyle. ' One of those Swiss-French-women one hears about, I dare say, who come from the top of Mont Blanc, and call themselves natives of Paris.' And then she proceeded to explain herself at more length. ' Mademoisede Harefield a _te terriblement choqu_ par le mort de sa pere. II mourissait sous des circonstances peniblement suspicieux. Les gens de cette village ont dit des penible choses sur son mort. Je toujours desire a penser le mieux touchant mes voisins, mais je confesse"], [236, "228 AN OPEN VERDICT. que le mort de Monsieur Harefield etait tres sus picieux.

Mon maison est tres petit, mais mes principes sont fortement fixes.' This French _ _ Stratford-atte-Bowe was quite incomprehensible to Madame Leonard, but she perceived dimly that Miss Coyle was not friendly to Beatrix. She bristled with indignation, and rephed in a torrent of rapid words which might have been Chaldee for any comprehension Miss Coyle had of their meaning, but the little woman's gestures told that Avorthy lady how much she had offended. ' Ah ! vous es une temps-serveur comme vos medleurs,' she exclaimed, when the Frenchwoman paused for breath. 'Mademoselle Harefield a beaucoup de monnaie. C'est assez pour vous. Mais quand vous laissez ede je vous promis que ce sera diflicde pour vous a trouver un autre situation.' And with this assertion that Madame Leonard"], [237, "AM I NOT NOBLER THROUGH THY LOVE ? 229 was a time-server hke her betters, and that she would find it difficult to get another situation when she left Miss Harefield, Miss Coyle put up a brown hodand parasol, which seemed made expressly for virtuous poverty, and vanished in a cloud of dust, like an angry goddess. ' But this woman is mad ! I comprehend not one word that she says/ exclaimed Madame Leonard inwardly. ' Who can have anything to say against that dear angel ? She is an envious, a malignant.' The warm-hearted httle Frenchwoman had too much delicacy to speak of Miss Coyle's out burst of spite to Beatrix.

There was a small household which had a pecu liar interest for Cyrd. A widow and her son occupied a wretched back room in one of the Avretched houses in a bhnd alley, a festering lane shut from the air and hght by the overshadow ing bulk of a huge factory, whereof the chimney, although under legal covenant to consume its own smoke, rained showers of blacks upon the surround ing neighbourhood, like the spray from a perennial soot fountain. Nothing could be more squalid than the house in which Mrs. Joyce and Emmanuel Joyce, her son, hved. Their neighbours were no cleaner or tidier than the rest of the community. There was the usual all-pervading odour of fried herrings, and decaying cabbage-leaves. The back yard, nine feet by six, was a horror to stop the nose at. The eye was offended by hideous sights, the ear was outraged by foulest language, and yet in this leper-house there was one spot which the infected air of the place had not tainted."], [243, "235 I ONLY LEARNED TO DOUBT AT LAST. Mrs. Joyce and her son had contrived to impart neatness and order, and even a certain respectabdity to the one small back, room on the I ground-floor, which constituted ' their house and home. Very small were the means by which they had achieved this result, but the result was palpable to every eye. 'It's well to be them,' said the mother of many children, peering with longing eyes into the neatly kept parlour. 'If I had no childer I might make my place tidy ; but where there's chdder there's muck.' Emmanuel Joyce was a cobbler by trade. Now of all trades perhaps cobbling is about one of the most unpleasant with which to be brought into immediate contact, but Emmanuel, who paid his Aveekly rent punctually, and was in that respect a striking exception, had obtained leave to erect a small shed in the angle of the yard next his window. This shed was looked at with envious eyes by some of his fellow-lodgers, and talked of invidiously as an encroachment ; but here Em manuel squatted at his work in all weathers, and"], [244, "236 AN OPEN VERDICT. here he kept his tools, and those crippled boots and shoes upon which he exercised his healing art. In the parlour he had contrived to budd a couple of enclosed beds on the Scotch principle, which, though wanting in airiness, were tidy and decent. At night a curtain divided the one small room into two, and by day this curtain drawn back and neatly looped up, made one of the decorations of the neat parlour. A tall stand of flower-pots, Emmanuel's dearest care, screened the loathesomeness of the yard, and made the one window a bank of foliage and gay colour. The shabby odds and ends of furniture shone with the beeswax and labour which Mrs. Joyce be stowed upon them in the intervals of her plain sewing. There were cheap prints on the wall above the mantelpiece, and on each side of the fireplace there were three deal shelves, containing Emmanuel's much-prized collection of books, all picked up at odd times from the rubbish-box of a second-hand bookseller, and rebound and fur bished by Emmanuel's own dexterous hands."], [245, "237 ONLY LEARNED TO DOUBT AT LAST. ' My son is a great reader/ Mrs. Joyce said proudly, during Cyril's first visit. ' He keeps the money other young men spend on beer to buy books with.' Cyril went over to the shelves and looked at the books. Their character told him more about Emmanuel Joyce's way of thinking than the mother would have cared to tell. There was an odd volume of Shelley, another of Keats, a Milton, and a Shakespeare. So much for the poets. Then came Rousseau's ' Confessions/ in English, Tom Payne's 'Age of Reason/ and a dozen other books all more or less infidel in then tendency. ' Your son goes to church, I hope ?

' I should like to have a httle talk with your son,' said Cyril. 'Ah, sir, if you could but bring him to think better of his Maker, and his Maker's way of managing this world, it would be a blessed thing,' exclaimed the widow. ' That's all my son needs to make him as perfect as any human creature ever was upon this earth. He's the best of sons, he's the honestest, soberest, industriousest of young men. But it makes me shudder some times to hear him talk ; that bold, as if he'd been up among the stars, and knew the way they're worked. I believe it all comes of too much learning.'

He don't care for stories and such hke. He calls them fiddle-faddle. But he'll sit up half the night over a learned book, and then he puts his ideas into poetry.' Cyrd was warmly interested. To begin with, a cobbler who read Keats and Shelley stood out prominently from the ruck of cobblers. It has been said that cobblers, as men whose habits are sedentary and meditative, have a natural leaning to infidel opinions ; but Cyrd did not beheve this. He did not believe that meditation must needs engender doubt. He who wrote the divinest work ever penned by an uninspired writer, ' The Imitation of Christ/ must have been of all men the most meditative. And did not Bunyan's twelve years of imprisonment in Bedford gaol bear fruit in 'The Pdgrim's Progress?' a book that has done more to popularize Christianity than all the writings of all the bishops who ever wore lawn. Cyril could not see any reason why cob bling and Christian belief should be incompatible. 'I wdl call and see your son,' he said, Em-"], [248, "240 AN OPEN VERDICT. manuel happening' to be out of the way on his first visit. He called the following evening, a dismal rainy evening, when he thought the cobbler, as a man not given to spend his time in tap-rooms, likely to be at home. Nor was he disap pointed. Emmanuel Joyce was sitting at a little table, drawn close to the bank of flowers in the window, poring over a page of Carlyle's ' Latter Day Pamphlets/ his elbow on the table, his thin hand entangled in his long hair, and with far from a comfortable expression of countenance. That Thomas Carlyle is a grand and noble writer, no one who has ever read his ' French Revolution/ his ' Life of John Sterling,' and his ' Hero Worship,' could have the insolence to deny ; but he is a writer demanding a considerable expenditure of brain power on the part of his readers ; and for a Avorker who has been sitting in a cramped posi tion all day mending shoes, to find himself lost among the Immensities, or vainly endeavouring to grapple with Phantasmal Captains, Ineptitudes, and other strange creatures, is hardly the most"], [249, "I ONLY LEARNED TO DOUBT AT LAST. 241 refreshing form of mental solace after physical labour. Mrs. Joyce was sewing on the other side of the httle table, wasting her eyesight in order to economize her candle. Mother and son rose at Cyrd's entrance, and the widow brought forward the best chair, a battered old easy chair, which her son had neatly covered with bright-looking chintz, for the visitor. Emmanuel Avas tad, thin, and pale, with hollow cheeks and a projecting forehead, under which shone darkly bright eyes, large and bulbous. His lips were thin, his chin indicated a firmness of character verging upon obstinacy. It was an in teresting face, but not altogether a pleasant one, save when the young man spoke to his mother, and then his countenance was lighted by a smile which made it beautiful. ' Mother told me you'd been to see her, sir,' he said. 'She took it very kindly that you should spare time to sit down and chat a bit with her, especially as you didn't leave a tract behind you.'

It appeals to man's highest faculties \u2014 it kindles all that is best and greatest in his soul \u2014 but it does not pelt him with Scripture texts, or tell him that he is by nature a reprobate and castaway, judged and doomed before he was born.' ' Do you think the Bible tells a man that ? ' Yes, sir, it does. The Bible texts that were flung at my head in my chddhood and boyhood were all to one purpose.

' Am I to take your word for all that ? ' asked Emmanuel, his projecting eyes shining with a fierce hght. ' You are hke the rest of them.

' ' You have never visited one of those hospitals, or you would know that among those sufferers there are many whom heaven has gifted with a patience that makes life almost happy, and a faith that fills even their hours of pain with hope.' ' Dreamers and enthusiasts all,' said Emmanuel. ' Amongst them are some who have talents that make life interesting \u2014 or even genius that lifts them up above the common earth and creates for them a world of their own. We cannot measure our"], [253, "245 I ONLY LEARNED TO DOUBT AT LAST. fellow-men's misery or happiness, any more than we can measure the goodness and justice of God.

And then, warming with his subject, Cyril spoke strongly and earnestly of gospel truth as he believed it \u2014 the unsophisticated teaching of Christ. Emmanuel Joyce listened, and liked to hear, but his opinions were not to be shaken in an evening. He had too long cherished and cosseted the demon of infidelity, to be able to thrust the foul fiend out of doors at a moment's warning.

THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER. After that first interview Cyril saw Emmanuel Joyce often. His duty took him nearly every day to that f\u0153tid adey Avhere the cobbler contrived to grow his flowers, and to maintain a semblance of prettiness in his narrow dwelling. Whenever the curate had half an hour to spare in his daily round he spent it with Emmanuel, and their talk Avas generally of spiritual things ; for, like most un believers, Joyce loved to discuss the religion he pretended to abjure. One day when Emmanuel had quoted one of the most appading passages in 'Queen Mab,' Cyril s_rtled him by asking, \u2014 'Do you knoAv that Shelley was a lad of eighteen Avhen he wrote those lines, and that the poem was published without his consent ? You quote it to sustain your arguments with as much"], [257, "THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER. 249 confidence as if it were the work of wisdom as mature as Bacon's or Pascal's.' Emmanuel blushed. ' He was a boy in years, perhaps, but a man in genius/ he said. ' Granted. Shelley was a marvellous boy, with all Chatterton's precocity, and much more than Chatterton's spirituality. If the light of his genius led him astray, it was not the less light from heaven. I doubt not if Shelley had lived to be old he would have learned to believe in much that seemed fool ishness to his young imagination. Do you ever read Tennyson ? ' ' Tennyson is too tame for me/ ' Take my advice and read him. He is not so great a poet as Shelley, but he is a greater teacher. He and Victor Hugo are the two great moralists of the age ; and I would put Tennyson higher than Hugo, because his ethics are of a graver and calmer cast. I wiU bring you my Tennyson to morrow/ ' You are too good,' said Emmanuel, touched by the curate's tone of equal friendship."], [258, "250 AN OPEN VERDICT. He went to hear Cyrd preach, and listened Avith delight. He was willing to accept his new friend as a great moral teacher, but he was not widing to surrender his infidel opinions. He had hugged them too long. They were his hobby, as dear to him as a gaUery of pictures to a wealthy connoisseur, or a cabinet of old china to a fine lady. But although the citadel had not yet yielded, its foundations were considerably Aveakened. After a fortnight's acquaintance with Cyrd, the cobbler took his mother to church regularly every Sunday, much to the widow's dehght. It was the only happiness that had been wanting in her simple laborious life, to go to church leaning on her son's arm. So things went on till the middle of the summer. Emmanuel had left off reading infidel books, won altogether by the curate's sympathy. He stuck to his opinions, but he read the books Cyril chose for him, and enlarged the range of his ideas. Hitherto he had devoured books ravenously, but had not digested or absorbed their contents. Now he read in a methodic manner, and grouped his"], [259, "251 THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER. subjects, under Cyrd's advice. He had supposed that all hard reading meant useful reading, but Cyrd showed him that the best books were gene rally the easiest to read and remember. One day when Emmanuel began a theological discussion the curate abruptly stopped him. ' I am not going to talk to you about religion any more,' he said. 'Why not?' ' Because it is useless and unprofitable, harmful even, for both of us. I have said all I have to say about sacred things, and I have faded to con vince you. I will not talk of the gospel for the sake of argument, and with a man who has made up his mind to reject gospel truth. Let us talk of literature, politics, anything you like, except religion. I am warmly interested in the growth of your mind/ 'And you do not refuse to hold any communi cation with me because I am an infidel. You do not thrust me from you Avith loathing?' ' Assuredly not.

' Better and better the more I read him ' Just so. I don't think anybody ever thoroughly likes Tennyson at the first reading.' They went on to talk of the Laureate, and Cyril was surprised and pleased by the justice of the cobbler's criticism. Emmanuel was touched by the curate's forbearance. He expressed himself warmly when Cyrd was taking leave of him. ' You are a man in a thousand/ he said. ' You are not liberal in words only, but in acts. One would suppose that in your eyes I should be an out cast \u2014 a Pariah \u2014 Anathema Maranatha.' ' You are a man/ answered Cyrd, ' and your soul is precious in my esteem.'"], [261, "253 THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER. Now came dark days for the pestiferous slums and putrescent lanes which surrounded and hemmed in the high street and market-place of Bridford, hke a foul netAvork of brick and mortar, shutting out the fresh sweet breezes that sweep over wood and pasture, moor and corn-field, and all the spicy summer odours of wdd herbs and flowers. Mysteriously, scarce anyone knowing where the rumour first began, there arose the cry that cholera was in Bridford. People stood at the street corners, and on the door steps, teding one another of this fatal visitant, with awe-stricken faces and hushed voices. They Avere accustomed to small-pox, they were but too famdiar with typhus and typhoid, Avhich two fatal diseases the great Jenner was just then seeking to differentiate. But cholera was a foe that came but seldom, and Avhen he came was scathing as that dark angel of the Lord before whose burning breath the host of Sennacherib melted hke snoAv. They had had cholera in the fatal year of '32. It had revisited them in '47 \u2014 and now, stricken with an awful dread, they clustered in little groups at the street corners, at the baker's, at the close little dingy shops that"], [262, "254 AN OPEN VERDICT. sold everything, and in which the atmosphere was pervaded with subtly blended odours of cheese, blacking, pickled onions, chicory, lucifer matches, candles, bacon, firewood, and red herrings. There was a general exodus of all the well-to-do people of Bridford. They packed their trunks in a feverish hurry, and carried their chddren off to the sea, whereby all the accessible watering-places were sorely overcrowded, and a fertile crop of typhus and scarlatina was grown in close lodgings and sewer scented bedchambers ; so much so that it was afterwards asserted that those who stayed at home, and faced the perils of cholera, and did a good deal to help then poorer neighbours, fared better than those more cautious spirits who fled before the face of the foe. Cyrd worked clay and night. He had studied surgery in Paris in one of his long vacations, and had gone about among the London hospitals in order to be of use in cases of emergency. He was now a valuable aid to the overworked parish doctor and his pallid assistant. The disease had spread fast among the croAvded tenements under the shadow of the"], [263, "THE ONLY SON OP HIS MOTHER. 255 great chemical factory. Those fumes of sulphur and oxahc acid which poisoned the air of heaven in this locality proved no antidote to the cholera poison- There had been a good many deaths already. Cyril hunted the parish officers to accomplish such sani tary improvements as might be effected on the spur of the moment ; but the whole neighbourhood Avas a nest of rottenness. There was not a drain that did its duty, or a sewer that did not breathe forth pollu tion by day and night. The funeral bell sounded ad day long, and the faces of the people were pale and worn with an ever-present fear. Emmanuel Joyce went on with his dady work, and his nightly studies. He wrote dismal verses about the cholera fiend and his victims, and was more than ever inclined to question the justice and benevolence of his Creator. ' It isn't for myself I'm afraid,' he said to Cyrd, Avho had scanty leisure now for hterary discussions, but who looked in at Mrs. Joyce's parlour once a day for five minutes' friendly chat. ' A man can die but once. I'm no more afraid of sudden death than a soldier is when he stands in his place in the ranks"], [264, "256 AN OPEN VERDICT. and knoAvs that the next shot may be for him. But I can't help feeling for the poor creatures round about \u2014 the mothers taken from their young children \u2014 the hard-working fathers carried off, and their little ones left to starve.' ' It is hard, I grant,' said Cyril. ' But there is some good in all evd tilings. This dreadful outbreak may arouse the corporation of Bridford from their Avicked apathy. We shall have sanitary reform, perhaps, after this awful warning.' ' Ay, they'll shut the stable door when the steed's stolen,' retorted Emmanuel, bitterly. A few days later a death occurred in the house in which the Joyces lived. Cyrd found the widow sitting with her work in her lap \u2014 she whose needle was rarely idle \u2014 pale, and crying sdently. ' Oh, sir,' she sighed, ' my poor Emmanuel, my blessed, well-beloved son ! ' ' Dear Mrs. Joyce, is anything amiss with him ? Is he ill ? ' asked Cyril, alarmed. ' No, sir\u2014 not yet.

In life or death we are with Him. Why should Emmanuel be the next ? He is sober and cleanly. He is better cared for in every way than his neighbours.' ' Oh, Mr. Culverhouse, I love him 'so, he is all the world to me. I could not live without him. I have watched him grow up, as a child watches the one flower in his little garden.

But he had drained his purse in giving a little help in cases where help was most bitterly needed.

And now the wealth was useless and idle, and he and the woman he loA'ed were unlike unhappy. His purse was empty ; he could give Emmanuel and his mother nothing but friendship and pity. He saw them every day, though the continual calls upon his time made every moment precious. Unhappily Mrs. Joyce had not the firmness of soul that can face a danger near at hand.

Emmanuel's life was made a burden to him by his mother's care. She wanted him to take half a dozen different concoctions in a dajr. His affection yielded, while his common sense revolted.

Hereupon the widow began to cry. ' I'm so anxious about you, Emmanuel,' she said. ' And so am I anxious about you, mother, but I don't worry you nor myself. What's the use ? Here we are, rank and file, like soldiers, and the shells are exploding round us on every side. We may get hit, or we may not. There are survivors after all great battles. Think of those old fellows we have seen who were all through the Peninsular war. How many times must they and death have been within an inch of each other ! We are no worse off than they were.' The tolling of the funeral bell came like a full stop at the end of Emmanuel's speech. One of Mrs. Joyce's ideas for the preservation"], [271, "263 THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER. of her son's health \u2014 of herself she thought no more than if she had been invulnerable \u2014 was to get hhn as much as possible out of the tainted neighbour hood he lived in. She urged him to abandon his evening studies, and to take long walks into the country, she going with him. The young man humoured this fancy as he would have humoured any wish of his mother's, and the two used to set out after Avorking hours on a rural tramp. The country, or anything pretty in the way of rustic scenery, was not easdy reached from Bridford. Long dusty high roads, bounded by uninteresting fields of mangel, or turnips, had to be traversed before the weary pedestrian arrived at anything rural or refreshing to the senses. Emmanuel and his mother had both a keen love of the beautiful, and they overwalked themselves nightly in the endeavour to reach some green hill-side or wooded dell they knew of. The evenings were sidtry and oppressive. More than once the wayfarers were caught in a thunder- shower, and went home wet to the skin. Altogether this precautionary measure of Mrs. Joyce's was about the worst thing she and her"], [272, "264 AN OPEN VERDICT. son could have done. The end was fatal. One night Emmanuel was seized with racking pain, and the usual symptoms of Asiatic cholera. The parish doctor came early in the morning. Yes, there was no room for doubt, it was another case. The widow heard his opinion with a stony calmness. All her fussy anxiety seemed gone. Her pale set face betokened a despair too deep for words. She sat by her son's pillow. She wiped the drops of agony from his drawn face. She obeyed to the letter every direction the doctor had given her. ' How good you are ! ' she said once, when she had seen the struggle between fortitude and pain, ' how patient ! Oh, my dear one, surely this is Christian patience. I know it. I feel it. At heart you are a Christian.' ' I have tried to live an honest life,' the sick man answered, feebly. ' I have tried to keep my name fair in the sight of men \u2014 and to do as much good as I was able to my neighbours.' ' That is Christianity, my dear. If you would but acknowledge But no, I won't talk to you now. God will have mercy.

' Mother, if I should be taken away,' Emmanuel said later, ' I know Mr. Culverhouse will be good to you. You will not be friendless.' ' Not friendless ! I have no friend but you. The earth would be empty for me if you were gone. Oh, my boy, my boy, do you think that I could go on living without you ? ' Cyril overheard these two speeches. He had knocked gently, and, receiving no answer, had softly opened the door. The neighbours, a family of nine, in the front room, had told him of Em manuel's state. ' Oh, sir/ cried the widow, turning to him with streaming eyes, 'it has come. You know how I dreaded it \u2014 how I have prayed against it. I thought God would have mercy, that the scourge would pass by this door, as the angel of death passed by the doors that were sprinkled with the blood of the Lamb. But He has been deaf to my t prayers. ' He is never deaf to prayer, though He may"], [274, "266 AN OPEN VERDICT. not give us the answer we desire,' said Cyril, gently. ' Do not give way to despair. With God's grace your son will recover, as so many have done.' ' But how many have died ! ' said the widow, sadly, as she resumed her seat by her son's pillow. Cyril stayed for more than an hour, comfort ing both the sick man and his mother by his pre sence. He said very little to Emmanuel, for the sufferer Avas in no state to talk or to be talked to. It was one of those cases in which a death-bed repentance \u2014 a calm survey of past errors and sins \u2014 a deliberate act of allegiance to God \u2014 was not to be expected. The sinking soul might clutch at the cross held aloft before those dim eyes, as a drown ing man catches at the rope flung out to him at his last extremity ; but any act involving thought, any calm reception of divine truth, was impossible. To Cyril's eye the young man seemed already sink ing. He opened his book by and by without a word of preface, and read those chapters of St. John's gospel which contain Christ's parting address to His disciples \u2014 words whose pathetic minor seems to breathe sad sweetness into dying ears. Emman-"], [275, "THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER. 267 uel's face brightened as he heard. He remembered how he had loved those chapters long ago, when he had read them at his mother's knee, before his father's severity and the hard ascetic life had made ad religious reading hateful to him. ' Yes/ he murmured presently, in an interval of pain. ' That is a lovely farewed. Those used to be your favourite chapters, mother/ ' They are so still, dear. I haA'e never tired of them.' Cyrd left with a heavy heart, promising to call in the eA'ening, at the hour when he would be likely to meet the doctor. That anguish-wrung countenance of the Avidow's haunted him all day long. In the places Avhere he went there was little else but sorrow, but there seemed to him to be no burthen like unto this burthen of hers \u2014 a grief and a desolation beyond speech. ' He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.' Those words were continuady in his mind. For that one Avidow \u2014 blessed and chosen above all other afflicted women \u2014 God upon earth worked one of His greatest miracles. Thrice only"], [276, "268 AN OPEN AT3RDICT. in His earthly pilgrimage did He exereise that in effable power \u2014 and on this occasion it seemed exercised on the impulse of the moment. God's human heart had been touched by this entirely human grief. He did not say to the widoAv \u2014 as His servants now say \u2014 ' Rejoice, for your son is in heaven.' He gave her back her son upon earth. Cyril was heavy at heart, for he had seen eA'ery cause for fear in Emmanuel Joyce's condition. ' If it were my life, noAv, that Avas in jeopardy, it would matter very little/ he said to himself. ' Who is there to be sorry for me ? My cousin Kenrick would be grieved, perhaps, in a mdd de gree, to hear of my death ; but it Avould make very little difference in his life. This poor Avoman's existence will be desolate if she loses her son. There Avdl be nothing left her. Hard to break the chain of love when poverty and loneliness haA'e made each link so strong.' The twilight was closing in when Cyril went back to the room where Emmanuel Joyce was lying, in an agony that looked like the throes of death. The widow's ashen face indicated a know-"], [277, "269 THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER. ledge of her son's perd. She tried to speak, but could not. She could only hold out her cold tremulous hand to the human friend of whose pity she felt assured, and look at him with wdd despair ing eyes. He pressed her hand gently, and sat doAvn by the bedside to watch the struggle, while he waited for the doctor's coming. ' You have done everything ? ' he inquired. ' Yes, I am sure of that.' The room had a stifling odour of laudanum and brandy. The sick man's pinched and livid face, holloAv sunken eye sand brow bedewed with death like dampness made Cyrd apprehend the worst. The hands grasping the coverlet were shrunken and Avrinkled, the skin shrivelled hke a washervvo man's after her day's labour. The oppressed respiration, the cold breath Avhich chilled the curate's cheek as he bent over his dying friend, alike inspired fear. Yet the brain remained unclouded all the while, and the hollow voice hoarsely whispered grateful acknow ledgment of Cyril's kindness. Never had Emmanuel Joyce been calmer in mind than in this dark hour. He waited with resignation sor recovery or death."], [278, "270 AN OPEN VERDICT. It Avas more than an hour before the parish doctor appeared. ' There are so many cases,' he said, apologetically. And then he looked at the patient Avith a calm business-like air that tortured the mother's heart. He felt the pulse, put his hard hand upon the clammy brow. 'He's very bad to-night.' ' Worse than he avus this morning ? ' asked the Avidow, hoarsely. ' Ever so much worse.' ' And you said this morning that he was in danger.' ' My good woman, I'm very sorry for you/ said the doctor, shrugging his shoulders, ' but it's a very bad case. Frankly, it's hopeless. There's no use in deceiving you. The young man is dying.' No cry of despair came from the mother's parched lips. She made no moan, but only crouched by her son's bed, clasping him in her arms, as if she would have held him back from death by the sheer force of maternal love. She never turned to \"look at the doctor as he moved slowly towards the door."], [279, "THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER. 271 ' I'm very sorry,' he said. ' It's a sad case. The drainage of tins place is shameful. We positively invite disease. I can't do anything more. You can go on with the laudanum and the brandy ; but I'm afraid it's useless. And you might put a mustard plaster to the soles of his feet.' Mrs. Joyce sprang up and ran to the cupboard, as if awakened to new hfe. There was a ray of hope for her in being told to do something, even though in the same breath the doctor said that it was useless. Cyrd followed the doctor into the dusky alley.

He was governed and impeded by a firmer spirit than his own, or he would hardly have done this thing; ' I ought not to do it on my own responsibility,' he said to himself. 'Suppose both men were to die, and there were an outcry against me in the newspapers. I should be ruined. If the air gets into the veins of either subject he is a dead man. I must have some one with me. Old Boiling would do. He's just the man.

It was a shabby old square red brick house in the market-place, and had never been painted outside or inside within the memory of"], [285, "' SICK, SICK, TO THE HEART OF LIFE AM I.' 277 man. It was a house of about twenty rooms. Old Boiling lived in two of them, and his housekeeper occupied a third. Rats, mice, spiders, beetles, and such small deer had free warren in all tbe others. There was a very fine breed of cockchafers on which the old physician rather prided himself. In the summer evenings they got into his lamp and candles, and made his dingy old surgery musi cal. The furniture was a miracle of antiquity and ugliness \u2014 tables as thick as tombstones \u2014 chairs that only a strong man could move \u2014 horsehair and moreen upholstery so interpenetrated with dust that brushing or beating would have been a mockery. Perhaps that is why the old housekeeper never attempted either process. Dr. Boiling seemed to have left off having his windows cleaned at some early period of his professional career. Perhaps the subdued light which crept through his opaque and smoke darkened panes suited him, just as smoke-coloured spectacles suit some people's eyes. The house keeper had left off suggesting that the windows would be better for cleaning."], [286, "278 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' What's the use ?

' ' Certainly,' agreed the housekeeper. ' They'd get dirty again \u2014 after a time.' ' Of course, and we should be no better off than we are now. I should have spent money on cleaning them for no purpose. Besides, if the AvindoAvs were clean my old furniture might look shabby. Now in this tempered light, it looks uncommonly well.' Common report declared that Dr. Boiling was a miser. The popular mind reasoned in this Avise : that no man who was not a miser would live in one corner of a dirty old house, Avear clothes too shabby for a Jew pedlar to chaffer for, and trot to and fro on his own feet from morning till night, when he could have afforded to make his house spick and span from basement to garret, clothe himself like a gentleman, and drive about in a handsome carriage and pair. But the actual fact was that Dr. Boiling did not"], [287, "' SICK, SICK, TO THE HEART OF LIFE AM I.' 279 care about fine furniture or good broadcloth, and that he liked to use his own legs better than to sit behind a pair of horses. He was a creature of habit. His mind was in his professional work. He hved only for science. In the Middle Ages he would have shut himself up in a laboratory and made all manner of uncanny experiments, with retorts and crucibles, and alembics, and much waste of quicksdver. In our enlightened age he confined his experiments to other people's bodies. He was a marvel of cleverness, experience, enthusiasm ; but in Bridford he did not stand nearly so high as Dr. Simper, who wore unexcep tionable black, drove a smart brougham in winter, and a smarter curricle in summer, and had his shirts starched by a French laundress. Lights were shining through the round holes in Dr. Boiling's shutters vvhen Mr. Saunders got to his door. ' That's lucky,' thought the parish doctor. ' The old man is in his surgery.'

' Have you ever tried transfusion ? ' ' In cholera ? No. I've done it in cases of severe haemorrhage \u2014 and successfully.' ' I want you to do it to-night.' And then the parish doctor told Dr. Boiling about Emmanuel Joyce and the curate's offer. ' Is your curate a strong man ? ' ' 1 should take him to be a healthy man. He has been wasting his strength a good deal lately in attendance upon the sick. But I should judge him to be a fair subject for the experiment.'

Dr. Boiling went to one of the roomy old closets in his surgery, and fished out a particular form of syringe : armed with this and his instrument case he was ready. The two doctors saw a cab Avaiting at the mouth of the alley, and they found Cyril Culver house standing in the doorway of the house that sheltered the Joyces. They all three went in together. Two hours' later Cyril came out of that crowded den, A'ery pale, and leaning on the parish doctor's arm. The two medical men had insisted upon his taking a glass of brandy, and reposing for some time in a horizontal position. The operation had been performed with every indication of success.

Mr. Saunders accompanied Cyril home to his lodgings, comfortable rooms in a queer old pan elled house in a narrow street shadowed by the gloomy stone wah of the parish church. The rooms Cyrd occupied were large, tidily furnished in an old-fashioned heterogeneous way, and scru pulously clean. The landlady was what is usually called a motherly person, which seems to mean a woman whose easy temper has run into fat. She had let her lodgings to curates for the last O O thirty years, her husband, as parish clerk, having a vested right to church patronage. She was of a soft and affectionate nature, and, not being blessed with chddren of her own, lavished ad her maternal feeling upon the beardless, or newly"], [291, "' SICK, SICK, TO THE HEART OF LIFE AM I.' 283 bearded youths who succeeded one another, in an endless procession, as occupants of her roomy first floor. Lively curates had objected to the gloom of the dusky old panelled rooms, with their deep window seats and narrow windows. Aristocratic curates had felt their personal dignity endangered by the shabbi ness of this narrow side street ; but no curate had ever been able to resist the insinuations of Mrs. Pod more's maternal affection. They might complain, but they could not leave her. She shed tears at the least hint of such a desertion, and what curate, rightly minded, could resist a woman's tears ? In her earlier life Mrs. Podmore had been able to ' do for' her curates, as she called it, with her OAvn unassisted labour. She had cooked for them, and Mrs. Podmore's cookery was one of the charms by which she subjugated the clerical mind ; she had kept their rooms clean and neat, and had even looked to their shirt buttons and darned their socks. But with advancing years and increasing obesity, Mrs. Podmore found herself compeUed to take ' a girl,' and a series of neat-handed Phdhses fodowed one"], [292, "284 AN OPEN VERDICT. another in a line as long as Banquo's issue. Mrs Podmore's requirements Avere high, and she demanded an amount of virtue and industry from the genus girl which very few specimens of that class were able to maintain for more than a twelvemonth at a stretch. Either the girl was saucy, and 'answered' Avhen Mrs. Podmore reproved her ; or she was slovenly, and left the flue in the corners of the rooms ; or she was that fearful animal, a breaker, and heralded her approach by a crash of dropped crockery, or a shiver of smashed glass. For the period of her service, hoAvever, Mrs. Podmore's girl was always neat and pleasant to see. She was generally fresh-coloured, and wore lavender gowns, with the sleeves rolled up above the elbow, and her elbows as a rule were rosier than Aurora's fingers. To the curates she Avas rarely saucy. They did not try her temper so severely as Mrs. Podmore tried it. In these quiet old-world lodgings Cyrd Culver house awoke on the morning after the experiment. The bells were ringing for the early morning service. Cyrd's usual hour for rising was fud an hour earlier. To-day it was only the sound of the bells close at"], [293, "' SICK, SICK, TO THE HEART OF LIFE AM I.' 285 hand that awakened him. When he tried to lift his head from the pillow it was as heavy as lead. ' I'm afraid I'm going to be ill,' he thought. He got up, took Ids cold bath, which revived him a httle, struggled into his clothes, feeling weak and giddy and miserable all the while, and ran across to the church. The choir boys were filing into the chancel as he got to the vestry. The Vicar was looking glum. O O ' I say, Culverhouse, as this early service is your fad, you might at least be punctual,' he grumbled, as Cyril Avas pulling on his surplice. ' I'm sorry to be late, but I don't feel well this morning.' ' Eh ? Nothing bad, I hope. You're as white as your surplice. You go too much among those poor creatures. Very proper, of course ; but a man owes something to himself, even if he hasn't a wife and family to consider.' Cyril got through his portion of the service somehoAv; but the gray old church walls, the monuments to departed citizens, the draped females leaning upon anchors, the chubby cherubs blowing"], [294, "286 AN OPEN VERDICT. trumpets, the urns and tablets danced before his eyes, like a confused vision of a stonemason's yard turned upside down. He hardly knew what he Avas read ing. His own voice had a far-away sound, as if it belonged to some one else, or were the echo of words he read yesterday. He had a curious uncertainty of mind about times and seasons, and could not have told whether it was winter or summer. ' I'm afraid I shall not be able to attend to my parish work this afternoon/ he said, when the service was over. ' No, no, my dear fellow,' ansAvered the Vicar, heartily. ' Go home and rest. You've worked hard enough to have earned a few days' repose. I dare say that wid set you right.' Cyril went home, and threw himself down on his bed, and lay there helpless, inert, no one knowing anything about him, tdl Sarah, the maid-of-all-work, came at six o'clock to lay the table for his frugal dinner.

Cyrd gave her a rambling answer. She ran quickly down, and told Mrs. Podmore that Mr. Cul verhouse had gone out of his mind. He was lying on his bed, and talking ever so queerly. The land lady waddled slowly upstairs, halting to pant at every landing, anxious, but too fat to travel fast, even if the house had been blazing. Just as she reached the first floor the street door bell rang. Sarah ran down to answer it, and found herself face to face with Dr. Saunders. ' Oh, sir, how lucky you've come ! ' exclaimed the girl, ' Mr. Culverhouse has gone out of bis mind.' ' Nonsense, girl ! ' The doctor ran upstairs and sat down by Cyril's bed. He found him very weak, and with a good deal of fever about him. He answered Dr. Saunders's questions with difficulty, and had a distressed and anxious look about his brow and eyes. ' I've some good news for you/ said the doctor, cheerdy. 'Emmanuel Joyce rallied considerably during the night, and it's Boiling's opinion that he'll mend.'"], [296, "288 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' I'm very glad of that/ said Cyrd, faintly. ' Now how about nursing ? ' inquired Mr. Saunders. ' This is a case -of exhaustion and low fever. Mr. Culverhouse has been overworking himself lately, and he's thoroughly worn out. He will want a great deal of care. Good nursing will be important.' 'As far as my strength wdl let me he shall have every care,' protested Mrs. Podmore. 'But I can't boast of a strong constitution, and I'm troubled with my breath if I move about much. But as to beef tea, and chicken broth, and jelly, I can make them as Avell as any one.' ' Beef tea and broth will be wanted ; but the chief thing is to see that he takes them. He must have nourishment every half-hour. Look here, my good girl,' said Dr. Saunders, turning to the servant, ' you must help your mistress to nurse this gentleman day and night, till we can get a professional nurse/ ' Yes , sir,' said Sarah.

' I'm a very hght sleeper, sir. I sometimes hear the church clock strike every hour of the night.' ' Living so near the belfry I hardly wonder that you do,' said the doctor. He gave full directions as to what was to be done for his patient. It was not a case for drugs, but for care and nourishment. The loss of blood, coming upon a constitution much worn with work and watching, had caused a greater shock to the system than Dr. Saunders, or even Dr. Boiling, had appre hended. In the next street the parish doctor ran against Mr. Pudge, a man with a pale fat face, greasy, smeared with printers' ink, sub-editor of the Brid ford Chronicle. ' How are your patients going on ?

Her steadiness outwore suspicion, as water wears rock. Every month, and sometimes every mail, brought Beatrix an Indian letter. Her lover sent her a full account of his life, Avhich had now become full of action and excitement. The second Burmese war had broken out, and was being carried on with more valour than discretion. A town was taken trium phantly and with little loss, and then abandoned to the care of a force too weak to keep or defend it. Retaken by the enemy, it had to be conquered again, and this time with a severe struggle. Prome was taken twice ; the city of Pegu three times. Detach ments were cut off ; officers were murdered. Sir Kenrick's regiment was in the thick of the strife. He had won his captaincy, and hoped, in a struggle that favoured rapid promotion, to get another step before he came home.

Then came a spirited description of the last skir mish. Beatrix followed the news of the war with attention and anxiety. She sometimes felt that her heart was wickedly cahn in this period of danger and uncertainty. Any mad might bring the news of her lover's death, cut down from a scaling-ladder, or treacherously murdered by the foe. Every letter she received might be the last that strong young hand would pen. Though Kenrick wrote so lightly and gaily of the war, the facts were not less awful. It was an insignificant business in the history of the"], [302, "294 AN OPEN VERDICT. world, perhaps, but death was as busy there as at Marathon or Waterloo. ' If I loved him as I ought to love my betrothed husband, I should not have a moment's peace,' Beatrix thought, full of self-reproach. Towards the close of the summer, just at the time when Emmanuel Joyce was stricken Avith cholera, Beatrix's health began to languish a httle, and at Mr. Namby's advice she went to Whitby with Madame Leonard, intending to remain aAvay some Aveeks. It was about this time that Bella Scratchell's life became full of perplexity and excitement. A curious, most unlooked-for event had happened, and had changed the whole colour of the Scratchell existence. Mr. Scratchell declared that Providence, pleased with the Scratchells' industry, economy, and patience, had at length taken the family under its wing, as directly and obviously as the Jews were taken in hand by the Divine power in the time of Moses. Mr. Scrat chell did not absolutely expect that miracles were to be Avorked for him, that waters were to be turned into blood, or flies to SAvarm in kings' chambers ;"], [303, "MR.

Like most men who mourn a first Avife Avith a somewhat exaggerated dolefulness, Mr. Piper had speeddy discovered a yearning to take to himself a second. He had not far to look for this second choice. BeUa had always appeared to his taste as the prettiest thing he knew. Her round plump beauty, the sunny tints of her hair, her peachy cheeks, and red fuU lips, her dimples and smaU round chin, her httle white hands and neatly shaped feet, all were after the fashion which in Mr. Piper's eye seemed the perfection of womanly beauty. A strong-minded woman, beautiful as Venus and grand as Juno, would have had no attraction for him. Mr. Piper had an awful dread of being hen-pecked. He wanted a wife whom he could treat kindly, and o-overn with a rod of iron. That rod of iron would O be nicely swathed in cotton-wool and velvet, of course, but it would be unbending. Mr. Piper had enjoyed life in his own way for the last twenty"], [304, "296 AN OPEN VERDICT. years, and he meant to go on having his own way so long as his faculties remained to him. Short of being like Dean Swift, and dying ' first a'top,' Mr. Piper meant to have his OAvn Avay, until he drew his last breath. Bella appeared to him by far the most pliable and soft-hearted young woman of his acquaintance, as weU as the prettiest. His children did not like her, but that was natural. The young Pipers had so strong a bent towards ignorance that they would have hated any one who tried to teach them. Mr. Piper was not going to be governed by his children's prejudices. The very best thing he could do for them would be to give them such a step- mother as Bella. The girls were wdd, rough, and tomboyish. Constant intercourse with a weU-mannered young Avoman Avould tone them down. ' She's every inch the lady/ Mr. Piper said to himself, ' and she'll make ladies of my gals, if they'll let her.'

' You have your daughters for companions, Mr. Piper/ she replied to those charges. ' You can't want me/ ' But I do,' retorted Mr. Piper. ' My gals are no company for me. They haven't mind enough, and they're not pretty enough. I like to see a pretty face on the other side of the table, when I sit down to my victuals.' Bella shuddered. Could any girl\u2014 even one who had known poverty's sharp stings from her cradle upwards \u2014 consent to marry a man who talked about victuals ? There was no harm in the Avord ; it was neither obscene nor blasphemous, but it was revolting. Although reproachful, Mr. Piper was not vin dictive.

They Avere terrified at the storm, but they were glad of its coming, since it afforded an excellent excuse for avoiding their lessons.

She stood at the window, watching the storm, while her pupils, released from the thraldom of study, and grown hardened to the tempest, rioted about the room, knocked over the chairs, pelted each other with lesson books, and concluded every argument with fisticuffs. She did not attempt to check this youthful exuberance \u2014 first, because she knew any such endeavour woidd be worse than useless ; and secondly, because the supervision of her pupils' moral conduct was not in the bond.

Upon this the manu facturer seated himself, Avith his shoulder at an uncomfortable angle with Bella's shoulder, after the manner of such ottomans. ' BeUa, I've been in love with you ever so long,' exclaimed Mr. Piper, plunging desperately into the middle of things. ' Good gracious, Mr. Piper, how can you say anything so horrible ?

While the church bells were ringing daily in the tower above his head, and the old Bridford chimes, famous long ago, were heralding the birth of every hour with a fine old psalm tune that pealed out over the busy, money-making city, like an echo of the past, Cyril Culverhouse was lying at the bottom of a dark gulf of pain and confusion, and all the outer world, and all the life that he had lived, were cancelled and forgotten. Strange images danced before his eyes hke motes in the sunshine, yet seemed to him neither strange nor unexpected. He had a history of his oavii in that period of delirium, a new identity, new surroundings, a mad, wild Avorld, peopled out of his own brain.

The elixir of life was not an impossibility. Here was Luther with his square solid face, and sensual humorous mouth. Here was Pascal, fuU of quaint sayings and far-reaching thoughts. The sick man talked for all of them. His talk was wddest raving to the ears that listened, but to his own fancy it was profoundest wisdom. There is no egotism, no belief in self, equal to that of the lunatic. For him the stars and moon have been made, for him God willingly performs miracles which overthrow all the laws of the universe. He is the axis of the world, and lets it go round. How long those days and nights of fever Avere! That was the chief agony of them.

He remembered Sarah, making believe to step softly, in creaking shoes, Avhose every movement was agony to him. But these things were lost in the darkness of remote ages. His present nurses seemed to have been tending him during a century. There were two, one taU and slender, dignified of bearing, yet gracious in every movement ; the other short, smaU, and brisk. They were dressed"], [325, "CYRIL'S NURSES. 317 exactly alike, in the costume of some religious order, as he supposed. They wore long black robes and white linen caps, such as he remem bered to have seen worn by the Sisters of Mercy in Breton towns that he had visited years ago in one of his long vacations. Admirable caps for ugly women, for the stiff linen borders projected a quarter of a yard beyond the face, entirely con cealed the profile, and overshadoAved the counte nance at all times. Cyril knew only that the taller of his Iavo nurses had dark eyes and a pale face, and that the little woman had black eyes of exceeding sharpness, that flashed at him from the cavernous cap.

' You are murderesses, and have come here to kiU me.' One night, after an age of fever and hallu cination, he sank into a refreshing slumber. It was as if his spirit, neAvly escaped from a burning hell, had slipped unawares into Paradise. Fair meadows and flowing streams, an ineffable sense of coolness and relief, and then deep rest and stillness. When he awoke, the summer dawn filled the room. Through the widely opened Avindows came the fresh breezes of the morning. A soft cool hand was on his brow, the tall nurse's dark figure stood beside his bed.

Very weak still, with a sense of utter helplessness and prostration, he yet felt himself cured. The fire that had made life a torture had burnt itself out. He looked up at his nurse. How purely white that quaint old head-gear of hers looked in the morning sunshine. He remembered the bright freshness of just such another morning in his hohday rambles five years ago, and just such another black-robed figure and white cap, a Sister of Mercy waiting for the starting of the ddigence, in the old market square at Vannes, the white dusty square, the scanty trees, that seem to have been planted yesterday, the shabby old cathedral looking down at him.

' Perhaps her cap is the prettiest thing about her, and she Avould rather show that than her face,' he thought. Even that brief conversation exhausted him, and he fell asleep again. Those weary hours of delirious wakefulness had left him long arrears of sleep to make up. He slept on till dusk, and Dr. Saunders, finding him locked in that deep slumber, pronounced him out of danger. ' Our medicines have never been able to touch him,' he said frankly. ' It has been an unaided struggle between nature and disease. I ought not to say unaided, though/ he added, apologetically, to the little nursing sister in the Breton cap.

I think my son's heart is turned to holy things. He has read his Bible very often lately. I have watched him, and I think he is beginning to find out that there is truth and comfort to be found in it.' ' He cannot read the gospel long without making that discovery. Young men are too apt to form their judgment of the Bible from what other people have Avritten about it.

' Whatever institution they belong to, it's an admirable one, and I'm sorry we haA .n't a few more institutions of that kind over here.

It worried him not a little to be under so deep an obligation, and to have no mode of expressing his gratitude. At one time he thought of putting an advertisement in the Times, thanking his unknown nurses for their care. But on reflection this seemed idle. They were doubtless what they represented themselves, sisters of some religious order, who did good for the love of God. They had no need of his thanks. Yet he puzzled himself not a little about"], [334, "326 AN OPEN VERDICT. the whole business.
