The various political advantages arising from the cession have been often set forth, and are too well appreciated to require enumeration in a pamphlet of topographical details. The country has singularities and advantages in various points of view, which, at a remoter period, may be estimated with impartiality, and found to be of importance. The following observations upon the Floridas have been collected, during a residence in the country ; in"], [12, "8 INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. which period several extensive journeys were made, with a view of obtaining materials for the construction of a new map, and for the purpose now brought forward. Some reports sent to the Indian department, at the seat of government, copies of which appeared in one of the Boston papers, contain a few of the results of the author's personal observations, and make the basis of these notes, though now modified, and in several parts changed, from the acquisition of better information. Those who may peruse these pages must not expect the glowing narrative of an agreeable excursion, through regions comparable to a paradise. The sub sequent relation has only truth to recommend it, and from the very nature of the work, must appear dry and tedious to all not immediately interested in the re sources of the territory. It will be observed that a fuller account is given of the Atlantic border than oi the Mexican shore ; its evident pie-importance, on some accounts, led naturally to the earliest examina tion, and the many excellencies it possesses encoura ged investigation, which the nature of the coast, and its nearer vicinity to recourses, rendered more practi cable ; added to which the author's domicile at St. Augustine, and the total ignorance of a country so comparatively near the capital, induced him to ex plore and remark personally ; and in consequence it may be noted, that on the map almost the whole sea-"], [13, "9 INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. Coast from St. Mary's river to cape Florida, is from hisown actual survey; the names of places are set down as best known to the very few residents in the vicini ty, and the traveller or shipwrecked mariner may rely upon the general accuracy of the detail. The fabu lous reports of the inland bays, lakes and waters, which have heretofore existed, respecting the south ern part of the Florida peninsula, will be readily ac counted for, on a view of the map, and a glance at the description of what is there actually to be found. It is lamented that no account sufficiently satisfac tory could be procured upon West Florida ; the com plete separation of the two divisions of the territory from all communication with each other, and the total impracticability of the author's extending his enquiries to that portion of the country, have been the occasion of this defect. Enough, however, is to be gleaned from former accounts to infer, that the soil and climate is not materially different from the adjacent lands in the Mississippi and Alabama territories. The able editor of the paper published at Pensacola, laments himself the dearth of topographical and statistical in formation, and has made his appeal to the few scat tered inhabitants to supply the defect ; but it has not been ascertained whether if with any and what success, the appeal has been answered. Called by his professional duties, it was not in the author's pow- 2"], [14, "10 INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. er to make an actual inspection of all the points he attempts to describe ; but he is under the conviction that his authorities are respectable, and he has not relied, except upon concurrent testimony, from more than one creditable source. In sketching the civil history of the province for the few years preceding the cession to the United States, the author is almost wholly indebted to the valua. ble manuscripts of George I. F.Clarke, Esq. surveyor general of East Florida, and lieutenant-governor oi the northern district of that province, while under the dominion of Spain. This gentleman, whose in formation on this and every other subject connected with the country, is very extensive, furnished with a peculiar urbanity every assistance ; and likewise some of the remarks on the Indians. The friendly assistance and judicious hints afforded by N. A. Ware, Esq. one of the commissioners of land claims, call for especial acknowledgments; indeed the present map and pam phlet were first put into a train of publication at his suggestion, and by his striking out the general ideas upon it. In the observations on the keys and reefs of the Florida point, the information of the resident pilots at the cape, have been chiefly relied on, as they were corroborated by the accounts of several masters of vessels, particularly Captain Snyder of New-York, who have navigated among them, and do not differ from the directions of Romans, De Brahm"], [15, "11 INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. and their co-temporaries, who have been fully consult ed and abstracted, as far as they were considered useful. It had always been a particular wish of the author to have given a list of all the grants upon record, but not having been able to obtain permission to search the archives, after the departure to Pensacola of the honourable Edmund Law, who had previous to that period the charge of them, he must confine himself to general accounts. He has located upon the map as many of the large grants as have come within his knowledge, but as he has no official information on the subject of any of them, they must be understood as having been laid down, solely with a view of grati fying the general existing desire of knowing, where the larger concessions lay, and their relative position to each other. In constructing the map of Florida, the author has availed himself of all the existing charts and maps, both domestic and foreign of all nations, as well as of various manuscript draughts. Among those consulted, were Romans' chart of Florida, the British nautical survey of West Florida, from the mouths of the Mis sissippi to the embouchure of the Suwanee, the roy al Spanish chart of the gulf of Mexico, from the ma rine depot at Madrid, and various other Spanish maps, Ellicott's map attached to his journal, while running"], [16, "12 INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. the Florida line, Gault's survey of the Florida keys, and a variety of other charts of the coast. Among the manuscripts made use of were ; Sketches of the ri ver Saint John, partly from the author's own drawing, and the rest furnished by Peter Mitchel, Esq. correct ed by a sight of Capt. Le Conte's accurate survey of the whole of that interesting river from its mouth up to the the very head lake, and a very correct British manu script chart of St. John's river, from the bar to the Cow ford ; the author's own survey of the coast from St. Au gustine to cape Florida, extending to the heads of all the waters on the Atlantic border; but his best assist- ance more particularly for the interior of West Florida, was from the manuscript map drawn by the late Jos. Purcell, Esq. formerly of S. Carolina, which is now in the topographical bureau at Washington, to which, with a liberality and attention never to be forgotten, the au thor was allowed access for the purposes of his map this document contained the results of all that was known to the British government up to the time of the re-cession of the Floridas by Great Britain to Spain- The boundary line as lately run by Georgia, was fur nished me by the politeness of the Surveyor General of that state ; Saint Mary's River, from the manuscript survey of Zephaniah Kingsley, Esq. an enlightened and valuable citizen of Florida; Nassau river and Dunn's lake, from surveys made under the direction"], [17, "13 INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. of Mr. Turnbull, a great proprietor in the Territory. The author's journeys in the interior, assisted by the valuable notes and information of Peter Mitchell, Esq. enabled him to fill up the detail from the old path to fort St. Marks, to the head waters of Tampa bay and across, along that parallel to the Atlantic. The re mainder is filled in by the information derived from Lewis, Hegan and Pent, respectable pilots at cape Florida, who mentioned the names of various persons, still living in the Bahamas, who had travelled there in, and by the unanimous testimony of every indian and indian negro consulted on the subject. Mr. Lew is, his father and family, lived for many years on va rious parts of the western coast, from the mouth of the Suwanee, down to Cape Romano, and he afforded me much local information. After all, 1 am aware the map is not perfect, but it concentrates all that is at present known of the terri tory; and if, where information was wholly unattain able, no directions can be given to the traveller or new settler, yet he may be assured that where the detail is laid down, that it is accurate and will not mislead him. Sensible of all possible respect for the opinions of an enlightened public, the work is offered to them, with all its imperfections on its head ; but conscious that some account was desirable of Florida, the author has in the following pages, and upon the"], [18, "INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. 14 map, used his humble endeavors to collect facts and describe realities. Should his attempt to afford a bet ter knowledge of this new country fail, he hopes the candor of his judges will attribute it to any thing but want of exertions, and pardon a futile essay, which was at least founded on good intentions. Since the manuscript of this work was completed, the accounts from East Florida, respecting the sugar cane, have been uncommonly favorable : several large establishments are about to be erected, and considerable investments are making for the ex press purpose of raising the cane. It is a matter of infinite satisfaction, that the certainty of sugar beco ming the staple of Florida is already established : let us hope that the success in this article, will induce other not less certain sources of wealth to be explo red. The olive, the grape, the silk-worm, and many more which are detailed under their proper head, are equally worthy the attention of the agriculturist. On the subject of the territorial government we have reason to believe, that by the exertions of the de legate from Florida, Joseph M. Hernandez, Esq. the east and west divisions will be placed under separate administrations and a separate board of commission-"], [19, "INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. 15 ers, appointed for each province ; by which means all existing difficulties will be smoothed and the hold ers of titles enabled without difficulty or expense to establish their claims, and settlers will pour in from all parts of the union to enjoy the advantages so liberal ly bestowed by nature upon Florida."], [20, "The map of Florida which is published at the same time with this book, by the author, will for the accom modation of the public, be sold, either bound up with it, or separately in sheets, done up in cases or mount ed and varnished, with roller, colored or uncolored as required."], [21, "HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS. Florida was discovered in the year 1-197, by Cabot ; but it doe_ not appear that the country was either named or explored until fifteen years afterwards, when Don Juan Police de Leon landed, in April, 1512, and finding the earth covered with a luxuriant vegetation, in flower, he styled the new region Florida, or Florida. Blanca. It was visited a few years afterwards by Narvaez, and many other adventurers ; and in 1638, Ferdinand de Soto, so cele brated in antient books of travels, disembarked an army in Spirito Santo Bay, and marched through the interior, fighting the Indians and destroying his troops, without gaining a single point ; and after traversing round to the Missisippi, died at the end of three or four years, near the mouth of the Red river. His narrative throws but little light on the real state of the country, and at present is looked upon as a mere historical romance ; for though he doubtless actually passed through the places he describes, yet with a view to palliate his lavish waste of life to the Spanish government, he has interwo ven fabulous accounts of gold, pearls and treasures, which never existed. The first colony in Florida was planted in 1562, by Ribault, a Frenchman, near the mouth of the river Saint John ; 3"], [22, "18 OBSERVATIONS UPON but the unfortunate Protestants, who had fled from persecution in Europe, found the vindictive spirit of bigotry follow, and in 15G4, Menendez exterminated them with a demoniac malignity, unequal led by the horrors of the fatal festival of Saint Bartholomew in their own country. Dominique de Gorgues, in 1568, took ample re venge, and hung the murderers on the same branches from which depended the bleached skeletons of his compatriots. Saint Augustine appears to have been built about 1565, and is undoubtedly the oldest town on the continent of North America, except the Mexican settlements. At the time this town was eva cuated in 1763, by the Spaniards, one at least of the original houses remained, with the date of 1571 upon the front, and all were with out chimnies or glass windows. Sir Francis Drake, in 1586, pilla ged the town ; a ceremony repeated by the Indians in 1611 : and in 1665 Captain Davis, in the piratical spirit of the times, once more desolated the place, which, from these checks, and other causes, does not appear to have much advanced in size or popula tion. Governor Moore of South Carolina, made a fruitless attack upon the fort at Saint Augustine in 1702; and in 1725, Colonel Palmer of Georgia, was equally unsuccessful. General Ogelthorpe, with a large force from Savannah, was completely repulsed in 1740, and retreated in disorder. At length the peace of 1763 gave the Floridas to Great Britain, and for the subsequent twenty years Saint Augustine appears greatly to have improved. The author has conversed with many persons who were there in June 1784, when it again reverted to Spain, and has heard them speak highly of the beauty of the gardens, the neatness of the houses, and the air of cheerfulness and comfort that seemed, during that preceding period, to have been thrown over the town. Neglect and conse quent decay, attended this interesting town during its occupancy by the Spaniards ; where time or equinoctial storms damaged any buildings, public or private, the hand of repair never came, and at"], [23, "19 THE FLORIDAS. the period of the cession, this once elegant place appeared ruinous, dirty, and unprepossessing. Pensacola appears to have been founded some time previous to 1696 ; it was in that year taken from the French by Riola, and in 1699, Monsieur D'lberville sailed in his attempt to retake it. la 1719, it was three times taken and retaken, and at length retained by France ; but in 1722 was restored to Spain. The prosperity of Pensacola and decay seems to have been somewhat similar to its sis ter city. The history of Florida is not the subject of this publication, and the preceding paragraphs have merely been drawn out to re fresh the memory of the reader, who will find in various modern publications more minute information ; but as some interest has been excited to learn the real state of affairs as connected with East Florida, for a few years previous, and at the time of the cession, the author is happy in being able to gratify the public wish. Sometime in the summer of 181 1, general Mathews appears, in consequence of an act of congress passed in the preceding session, to have been au thorised by the executive to proceed to the frontiers of Georgia, to accept possession of East Florida from the local authorities, or to take it against the attempt ofa foreign power to occupy it, holding it in either case subject to future and friendly negotiation. This act appears to have been passed in consequence of the revolution which had just broken out in the northern district of East Florida. This official appearance of American interference, alarmed the go vernment of St. Augustine, who appear to have appealed to the Bri tish minister at Washington, who accordingly expostulated with Mr. Monroe, then secretary of state. General Mathews appears in his zeal to carry the orders of the executive into effect, to have exceed ed his powers, indeed it has been confidently asserted that the in surrection was fostered by his appearance. His taking possession of Amelia Island and other parts of East Florida, was officially blamed, and his commission revoked in April, 1812, and the governor of"], [24, "20 OBSERVATIONS UPON Georgia was commissioned in his place, in consequence, as the ossi cial letter states, of general Mathews having employed the troops of the- United States, to dispossess the Spanish authorities by force : ordering a restoration of Amelia Island and other parts to the Spa nish authorities \u2014 stipulating for the protection of such inhabitants as had joined the Americans from the anger of the Spanish govern ment. A later letter states, that if the troops are to be withdrawn that governor l)_itchell is not to interfere, to compel the patriots to deliver the country to the Spanish authorities. The following letters will carry a true idea of the general history of that part of the country. [copy.] St. Augustine, 25th July, 1821, Capt. John R. Bell, Commanding the province of East Florida. Sir, The following is intended lo comply with your desire of infor mation on the northern division of this province ; and in order tq your comprehending the true state of that section, and the charac ter of its inhabitants, to whom, as the officer that presided over them for the last five years, I feel grateful for their confidence, their devotion, and their support, permit me to recapitulate a part of its history ; and first to premise : that it is bounded on the north by Camden county, Georgia, the southernmost part of the Atlantic states ; the river St. Mary, the line of demarcation, and a very narrow one, has long been the \"jumping place\" ofa large portion of the bad characters who gradually sift through the whole southwardly : warm climates are congenial to bad habits. Second, that, unfortunately for Florida, the laws ofboth governments had the effect ofmaking each country the asylum of the bad men of the other ; consequently, Florida must have received, we will suppose, twenty of those for one it returned to Georgia. This must be the result, on taking only a numerical view of the population of the two countries."], [25, "21 THE FLORIDAS. And thirdly, that by the orders of the Spanish court, prohibiting citizens of the United States from being received as settlers in Flori da, the only part from whence it was ever to expect a population sufficiently large to make it respectable, the good were prevented from coming in, while the bad must come. The result of an obser vation, perhaps inadvertent, made in congress long since, Florida must ultimately be ours, if only from emigration, and loudly comment ed on by the Spanish minister. The revolution, commenced in March, 1812, had spread general desolation and ruin over the whole province ; the dust of a siege had been thirteen months snuffed within the walls of St. Augustine. Dn the 6th May, 1813, the assailants were withdrawn, and the town pf Fernandina was restored to the Spanish authorities. The Spanish government had published a general pardon to its subjects, but, unfortunately, had limited it to three months, a time too short for the ebullitions of individual feelings to subside. Many, and those of the most energetic and influential character, would not trust themselves among the opposite party. The time expired, and those were consequently left out. And in August, of the same year, hostilities re-commenced ; more sanguinary scenes ensued ; and the insurgents aided by bands of idlers from Georgia, took and kept possession of all the territory lying to the west and north of St. John's river. Fernandina having become too weak for offence, and St. Augustine not being willing to let out all its troops, to hunt \" bush fighters/' the newly styled Republic of Florida, over which the in fluence of order had not been felt since March, 1812, and having now no compulsive inducement to union among its members, soon fell into the most wretched state of anarchy and licentiousness ; even the honest were compelled to knavery in their own defence, and thus continued until August, 1816 \u2014 while the most rancorous feel ings were bandied between the \" Pat-Riots\" of the main, and the \" damn'd Spaniards\" of Amelia island."], [26, "22 OBSERVATIONS UPON At that period preparations were making on the Maine for a de scent on Fernandina, then too weak to stand even on the defensive, and no succors were to be expected from our friends, nor was there any thing like good quarters to be looked for from our enemies. Governor Coppinger had lately received the command of the pro vince. I knew his energetic and benevolent character ; that his discretionary powers were very great, but his want of means, deplo rable ; and I personally knew the people of the main, and had had in other days, influence among them. I proposed a plan of recon ciliation and re-establishment of order. It was patronized by the governor, and I received orders to proceed according to circum stances. Messrs. Zephaniah Kingsley and Henry Yonge went with me up St. Mary's river to Mills' ferry, and met about forty of them, and after much debate an agreement for a general meeting at Wa terman's Bluff in three weeks, was concluded on. The day of meeting arrived, and none others but the gentlemen I have mentioned would leave Fernandina. We knew that nothing short of an election of officers would subdue those people, even should they be willing to submit to order at all ; and that was a course opposite to the principles of the Spanish government. How ever, extraordinary cases require extraordinary remedies ; and circumstances authorising a long stride, I provided several copies of a set of laws adapted to their circumstances, blank commissions, instructions, kc. A gathering of several hundred, besides a crowd of spectators from Georgia, met us at the place appointed, a mere mob without head or leader. I tendered them a distribution into three districts of all the territory lying between St. John's river and St. Mary's, with a magistrate's court and a company of militia in each ; and those to be called Nassau, Upper and Lower St. Mary's ; an election of officers from the mass of the people of each, without allowing the candidates to offer themselves ; that the officers to be elected should be immediately commissioned to enter on the funC'"], [27, "THE FLORIDAS. 23 tions oftheir offices ; and that all the past should be buried in total oblivion. These were received by a general expression of satis faction ; a table was brought out on the green, and in a few hours a territory containing about one half of the population of East Flo rida was brought to order ; three magistrates and nine officers of militia elected, commissioned, instructed and provided with laws. Every demonstration of satisfaction ensued ; they took up their offi cers on their shoulders, hailed by the shouts of hundreds. A plen tiful feast and many interesting scenes of friendship and mirth closed the important day. His excellency approved of the proceedings, and tendered me a superintending jurisdiction on the whole, which I admitted, on his consenting to strike out Amelia island : that had a commandant who had a plenty of leisure to attend to the complaints of Fernandina, and I have ever since allowed them the election of officers in filling up vacancies. Such has been the confidence and resignation of those people, that all complaints and appeals that should have gone before the supe rior courts at St. Augustine, have been referred to me for an opi nion, and those opinions have ever been voluntarily conclusive, to any amount. And such their devotion to the government, that at the shortest notice, any part or the whole force of the three districts have met me at the place appointed, mounted, armed and victualled, each at his own expense. Three facts speak volumes in favor of those inhabitants : \u2014 First, that in five years there has not been one appeal and but one com plaint to the superior authorities, in St. Augustine, although the highroad to both has all the while been open. Second, that Geor gians prefer suing Floridians in that part of Florida to suing them in Georgia. Third, that the credit of Floridians stands higher in Georgia than ever it did before, from whence they get all their sup plies. Such is the deplorable state of human nature, that a rob"], [28, "24 OBSERVATIONS UrON bery or a murder will occur in the best regulated societies ; within a fortification ; but 1 can venture to assert, that in no part of the civilized world do fewer irregularities occur among so many inha bitants, than in the northern division of this province. I would caution, that when the people of Florida are spoken of with censure, some regard would be paid to the person speaking, as to who he is, or from whence he gets his information ; to the pe riod to which reference is had, and the part of Florida alluded to. I am aware that the time has been when these were censurable, for they were above four years in a state of anarchy ; the broadside of their country open to the idle and vicious of Georgia ; and even as ter they were called to order, in 1816, some time was required for purification, by compelling many to decamp, and others to mend their manners. And on the other side of St. John's river, under an other local jurisdiction, many who were hunted out from the north ern division found toleration. We knew that a practice called Lynch's law had done more good in Georgia in a few months, before Florida was found to be an asy lum for the vicious, than the civil authority could have done in as many years in that part of the country ; and we were aware that some such energetic measure was indispensible to accelerate our purification. Fines, floggings and banishment, therefore, became the penalties for all wilful injury committed on the property of an other, not as a law of Spain, but as a special compact of the people. A man who stole his neighbor's cow, was tried by a congress of from twenty to thirty persons of his district, summoned for the purpose, and on being clearly convicted, he was sentenced to receive, tied to a pine tree, from ten to thirty-nine lashes ; and that was execute. on the spot, by each giving him two lashes, to the amount of his sen tence ; and the second offence of the same class was punished bj flogging and banishment from those districts. A few such examples firmly managed, and executed under the rifles selected from a com-"], [29, "THE FLORIDAS. 25 pany, drawn up for the purpose, (and but few were required) did us more good than a board of lawyers, and a whole wheel-barrow of law books could have done. A mere remonstrance was sufficient to reduce to a small amount-. on our side of St. Mary's river, the very grievous evil of parties of Floridians and Georgians combined, going frequently to the indian country of Florida to plunder cattle ; a lucrative practice that had been going on for years, and was carried to such excess, that large gangs of cattle could be purchased along that river, at the low price of from two to three dollars per head. Efforts to suppress it altogether, we found to be in vain, without a suitable coincidence on the Geor gia side ; and experience had shown that the civil authority was too heavy booted to make much impression on those \" moggasin boys.\" I then wrote to general Floyd, who commanded a part of the Geor gia militia, and his prompt and efficient aid soon enabled us to put a finishing stroke to a practice replete with the worst of evils. When general M'Gregorgot possession of Fernandina, he was in the belief that he had conquered Florida to the walls of St. Augus tine, and that there was nothing more to be done, as related to these people, but display his standard, fill up his ranks, and march to the possession ; and under that impression he brought several sets of officers. But neither the offers, threats nor intrigues of himselfand his successors, Irvin, Hubbard and Aury, and their many friends in many places, could bring one of them to his flag. Whereas, when a call was made for volunteers to commence in advance the expe dition formed in St. Augustine, for the re-capture of Amelia island, every man turned out, well equipped, not excepting the superannua ted. We got possession of all Amelia island to the very town of Fer nandina, and kept it for several d.iys awaiting the troops from St. Au gustine. During that time.twenty-seven of these men sought for, gave battle to, drove from the field, and pursued to within the range of the guns of Fernandina, above one hundred of M'Gregor's men, 4"], [30, "26 OBSERVATIONS UPON with the loss of seven killed and fourteen wounded, and without ha ving lost one drop of blood on our side; leaving us to bury their dead. The reverses that afterwards attended that expedition were wholly to be attributed to the conduct of the commanding officer who arrived from St. Augustine. When the constitutional government was ordered in Florida, a few months since, some small alteration were made in the laws of those districts. They were but small, for the laws handed them in 1816 were principally bottomed on the same constitutional government, which had been in force in this province in 1813 and 14. But the administration of St. Augustine having been pleased to form the whole province, about fifty thousand square miles, into one parish, making that city the centre, so far defalcated what those people conceived their constitutional rights, that they petitioned govern ment ; and not getting what they expected, they had in meditation to send a representative to the captain-general of Cuba, and further should it be necessary, when the near approach of the surrender of the province to the United States levelled all dissentions. Those three districts contain about one half of the population of East Florida, say about fifteen hundred souls, and embrace three fourths of the agricultural interest of the whole province. They are very thinly settled, and form one of the most inferior sections of Florida, as relates to good lands, and indeed many other natural advantages. The causes that have congregated so large a portion of the industrious part of the population into one of the least delec table sections, are these : Its vicinity to Georgia, a populous coun try, bordering on the river St. Mary, a near and ready market for their produce and their supplies, and the facility of avoiding duties of exports and imports ; the occupancy or neighborhood of Indians in better sections ; the want of protections ; the want of a popula tion sufficient to protect itself ; and revolutionary broils with go vernment, forced upon us by foreigners in their over-strained assi-"], [31, "THE FLORIDAS. 27 <3uity for our welfare, gagging us with freedom, the most free-, civili zed people perhaps in the world, and would fain lately have put it down our throats with negroes' bayonets. [Vide the Jcnett, the Mathews, and the McGregor invasions, in 1794, 1812, and 1817.] East Florida was literally evacuated by the British, when deliver ed to the Spanish authorities in 1784. Perhaps no such other ge neral emigration of the inhabitants ofa country, amicably transferred to another government, ever occurred. Spain allowed it many ex traordinary privileges, such as were not enjoyed by any other part of her dominions, and continued augmenting them ever since. In 1792, Florida was opened to a general emigration, without excep tion of country or creed ; and it was rapidly progressing to impor tance, when the report of the Spanish minister I have mentioned, closed the gates against American citizens, some time about 1804, and virtually shut us in from the world as to a large population. The decline of this province must be dated from that period, in which a very large portion of the convulsions of Europe necessarily fell to the share of Spain, from her contiguity to imperial France, and which called her attentions and resources to objects of more consideration. But that decline was graduated by the nature of things to a slow progression, and we had other fair prospects in our favour, notwithstanding the prohibition ofa population from the Uni ted States, when the troubles of 1812 spread, in one year, universal ruin. The war between the United States and Great Britain, and the visit of McGregor, following in close succession, almost every one, who had the means of migrating, abandoned a country so much and so unmeritcdly affected. Your obedient servant, GEO. I. F. CLARKE."], [32, "28 OBSERVATIONS UPON [copy.] Circular to the officers and people of the northern division of Ea,t Florida. St. Mary's, Florida, 13th August, 1821. John Low, Esq. Magistrate of the lower district of St. Mary's. Dear Sir, I take the earliest opportunity afforded me since my return from St. Augustine, to communicate the following : The authorities of the United States having received possession of this province, on the 10th of last month, my functions as super intending officer of the northern division of East Florida, and those of surveyor-general of the province, have ceased ; and my claims on the Spanish government do not permit my receiving, at present, of ficial charges under the present government. I have not however taken my leave of you all, nor of my former residence : a recipro city of grateful feelings, happily experienced for the last five years, forbid my doing so. I have therefore promised captain Bell, who now commands this province, who has your welfare warmly at heart, and with whose amiable disposition you will be well pleased, that my every aid and assistance, ex-officio, shall be cheerfully employ ed for your good. While in St. Augustine, I laid before captain Bell, a long and candid statement of these districts ; a character of these people that I trust will ensure them the consideration of their new government ; copies of which will be transmitted to the executive of the United States, to general Jackson, and remain in Florida as a record of their merit. It was to me a pleasing task ; a tribute due to their devotion to their country, and to the confidence and support I have all along ex perienced from them.

Where but in the same division can it be said, that foreigners prefer suing the people of the country in their own courts, to suing them in theirs, where they have them frequently in their power ? Where 'but in this meritorious division can it be said, that any part of, or the whole physical forceps three districts, have never failed to meet, at the earliest notice, and that cheerfully, to execute any orders given, ar med, mounted and victualled, each at his own expense, and without pay? An active, brave, hardy, and hospitable people. A people, who having been compromised and thrown into anarchy and confusion, by foreign bayonets, and remained afterwards above four years in a state of licentiousness, all came into order in one day ; and which government they have steadily supported with their person and pro perty ever since, now five years ! A people, who not all the offers, threats, or intrigues of McGregor himself, nor those of his suc cessors, Irvin, Hubbard, and Aury, nor the craft and influence of many others at Fernandina and elsewhere, could bring over one of them from their fidelity to the Spanish government. A people, seven and twenty of whom sought for, gave battle to, and drove from the field above one hundred of McGregor's men, in a body, com manded by Irvin, in sight of their own quarters, without losing one drop of blood ! The representation I have handed in, as a record in their favour, is too long for insertion here ; but a copy remains in my hands, and I trust will be read with general satisfaction. All papers laying in my possession, and appertaining to individuals of these districts, will be carefully distributed to their owners, as soon as leisure will permit me to attend to them. y Captain Bell has authorized, according to the proclamation of ge neral Jackson, a continuance of all your offices and former functions, until laws are formed by higher authority for the government of the"], [34, "30 OBSERVATIONS UPO.V province. He recommends that the judiciary should be confined to such cases and matters as do not admit of, or require appeals beyond the exclusive jurisdiction of these magistrate courts ; that all others should lay over until farther orders.

The proceedings of the United States in West Florida having been conducted by general Jackson, and repeatedly laid before the public, do not need repetition here. It would be an invidious task to detail the events that have occurred in East Florida since the ex- change of flags. The variety of perplexing circumstances, the con- flexion of laws, and the embarrassments arising from the great distance from the place whence orders emanated, which have successfully been the fate of St. Augustine, will, by the wisdom of con- gress, have entirely been removed, and forgotten before this book issues from the press. The only circumstance of much interest arose from the circumstance of the secretary of the province having a day or two after the cession, found it necessary in the absolute want of all law regulation, police, or magistracy, to exercise his au- thority upon the occurrence of some peculiar circumstances, re- specting the carrying off of slaves, to confine fora very short time one of the citizens in the fort of Saint Augustine : five months af- terwards, upon a trial before the county court, damages were awar ded against captain Bell, when the inhabitants, by an unanimous re solution made up the tine by subscription, and the following letters were written to and from that gentleman, which having never been made generally known, are now laid before the public."], [35, "31 THE FLORIDAS.

Sir, When a people receives from its rulers the protection due to the persons and property of the individuals who compose it, when such rulers cause the laws to be observed, and when their actions are guided by the general good, so that their fulfilment of their august charge, is consonant with the duties imposed on them by society, they make themselves at the same time, worthy of the esteem and gratitude of that community over whom they have presided. The Floridians call to mind with pleasure the short but satisfacto ry period, when in you sir were united the civil and military com mand of this province, wherein we are aware you acted as far as was practicable for the public welfare, in the administration of jus tice ; and consequently it was not with an ear of indifference that the sentence given by the court of this county was heard, amercing you in the sum of three hundred and seventeen dollars and four reals, for a proceeding, in which your sense of equity could not al low you to act otherwise than you did. It is not to be understood however, that the award of the court is called arbitrary or unjust ; the people are too well aware of the respect due to all tribunals to at tempt to trench upon their prerogatives : but they however know. that under the circumstances in which you gave the order, in conse quence of which this fine has been laid, such a measure was necessary for the tranquillity of this place. In a country recently taken possession of by another government different in its laws, lan guage and customs, wherein the new authorities have no definite knowledge of its inhabitants, its necessities, in a word of any thing, there must naturally result in the changes from one administration to the other defects, which are consequences of the confusion"], [36, "32 OBSERVATIONS UPON reigning upon the establishment ofa new system.

[answer.] Gentlemen, I received your letter of this morning. The various emotions it has excited it is impossible for me to express. The language of feeling is brief; and I must reply to it with the bluntness and since rity of my profession. I was called upon to exercise the undefined and dangerous pow-"], [37, "THE FLORIDAS. 33 *\u00bbrs entrusted to me by the governor of the Floridas. I would wil* Jingly have evaded this invidious trust, but I was commanded, and it was my duty to obey. I was not promised, have not expected, nor have I received any benefit for my services. I found myself called upon to protect a virtuous and industrious people, from the rapacity and violence of adventurers from every part of the world who looked for redemption from punishment, from the absence, as they suppo sed, of all law and government. I was actuated by a sincere desire of protecting the rights of the citizens of Florida, committed to my charge, without any regard to their being Spanish or American. I did not think it necessary to ascertain with legal precision, whether my powers were to be measured by the limits imposed by the old or new constitution of Spain. The good of all, the peace of the whole community were my only rule of conduct. 1 had no antipathies to indulge in, no resentments to satisfy. I was a stranger to all. If I have erred, if the verdict of a jury of my countrymen should at some future period, be brought up in array against me when circumstances are forgotten , I will powerfully appeal for my acquittal to your affectionate letter, and challenge the world to pronounce the person guilty of tyranny and oppression, who has received so unani mous a testimonial of approbation of his administration, from a peo ple so feelingly alive to a sense of injustice, so warm hearted and so generous. I cannot therefore decline your offer. The time is not far distant, when under the favoring influence of the American constitution, the virtues of the antient inhabitants and proprietors of Florida will be duly appreciated, when they will have to claim and will assert their right to the exercise of government, and when the base individuals, who now endeavour to set one por tion of the community in array against the other, will receive due execration. Be pleased to present my affectionate regard to the gentlemen whose sentiments of approbation you have conveyed, and for your- 5"], [38, "34 OBSERVATIONS UfON THE FLORIDAS. selves, receive the gratitude for the feeling language in which it has been expressed. 1 remain your affectionate servant.

Now that Florida is about to be governed by the wholesome laws ofa republic, and that the shackles which have hitherto impeded her improvement are taken off, we may rationally look forward to read in the page of her future annals prosperity, happiness and in dependence. When the real superiority of our territory is duly appreciated, it will be found pre-eminent in agricultural importance; and when an extensive, industrious and respectable population send their representatives to congress, Florida will be confessedly ac knowledged not wanting in intellectual endowments ; and the pre sent humble recorder of her resources looks forward to the time when her suture glory will be transmitted to after times, by the ele gant pens of native historians."], [39, "3ft TOPOGRAPHICAL OBSERVATIONS The river Saint Mary, which is part of the northern boundary of Florida.was formerly supposed to have originated in the Oke-fin-o-cau swamp ; but this appears to be an error, as there is a high pine ridge between the source of the stream and the swamp. This cir cumstance was communicated to the author several years since by major-general Gaines, who had himself ascertained the fact. The upper branches of this river partake very much of the charac ter of those of the Edisto and Combahee rivers, in South Carolina. There are a few saw mills erected there, and more probably might be built with advantage ; lower down the lands may be made capa ble of the cultivation of rice. The bar of Saint Mary's river has from 20 to 28 feet water. There are two entrances bold and safe ; the light-house is on the northern side of the entrance on Cumberland island ; Amelia island at the mouth of St. Mary's river, i\u00bb well set tled ; considerable quantities of fine live oak have been obtained from this island at various periods, but it is now almost gone, at least all the timber fit for large vessels of war. At the north end of Amelia island is the small town of Fernandina, which sprung up during the embargo in 1808, and the subsequent war. At present it droops ;"], [40, "36 OBSERVATIONS UPON but the excellence os the anchorage opposite the place, will doubt less in due time make it more resorted to, and the town will again flourish. An inland navigation exists through the narrows between Ame lia island and the main land. After passing the straits, Nassau river discharges itself between Amelia and Talbot islands. This river is supplied by many branches, and is navigable a considerable distance up ; the lands are rich, but subject to inundations. Rice plantations may certainly be established here, and made profitable. Talbot and Fort George islands are seperated from the main by na vigable creeks, and are fine cotton islands. These passed, the mouth of the river St. John presents itself. Passing it by far the present, we may proceed up Pablo creek, immediately opposite the mouth of the branch separating Fort George island from the main. The lands in the vicinity of Pablo are excellent, and in cultivation. The sugar has been successfully tried for two years back by Mnjor Chairs. Pablo creek heads in Diego plains, as does also the North river, which leads down lo the harbor of Saint Augustine. A short canal of a few miles in length would complete the inland navigation from hence to Charleston. There is no inlet between the entrance to Saint John's river, and Saint Augustine. The latter harbour is good, but only affording 12 or 13 feet water, is very detrimental to its increase as a commercial town. Leaving a description of the town foi another place, we shall at present follow the outline of the coast. The navigation from the harbour of St. Augustine to the bar of Matanzas, along what is termed Matanzas river, though intricate, af fords water for such vessels as can pass the latter entrance. The St. Sebastian river, which forms the southern and western bounda ries of the city, is of some width at its junction with Matanzas river but owes its size chiefly to the influence of tide water : the head of navigation, including all the windings of the stream, is scarcely ten"], [41, "37 THE FLORIDAS. miles from its mouth, and merely serves to bring a little fire wood into the town : It heads in two or three prongs, one of which, called the Red-house branch, is a narrow but deep and rapid creek, afford ing scites for saw-mills, to be erected at some suture time : Moultrie creek has its mouth covered with several islands, and a long reef of oyster banks and mud flats extend for some distance, forming a se ries of shoals, at which the tides from the respective inlets of St. Augustine and Matanzas meet : Moses's creek fall into the river a few miles north of the latter bar, joining it where the marsh on the main side is wide, and intersected by a labyrinth of small channels, mostly dry at low water. Matanzas river in its whole extent is only separated from the Atlantic by Anastatia or Fish's island, which, at the southern extremity, is very narrow, being little more than a sand bank : upon a small island formed by the Matanzas' entrance on the south, and a creek navigable for boats on the north, and terminating Anastatia island, stands the old tower of Matanzas : the marshes here are wide, but the water course very narrow, particularly in pro ceeding towards what was called the little bar ; the Only access to which, and to the creeks southwardly, is through an artificial vent or canal, dug by the Spanish soldiers and Havana negroes by permis sion of the late government, a voluntary subscription having been raised by three or four planters to pay them : on the site of this was some short time back a natural creek, but a violent gale, com pleting the gradual accumulation of sand at the mouth of the little bar (barra chica), filled that entrance at last and stopped the passage of the waters towards the great Bar also : although the canal affords a boat communication, yet it is insufficient to carry off the great body of fresh water coming down from two large swamps, and the marsh es on each side are completely overflown at present, more particu larly on account of the heavy rains during the preceding season : The water in its efforts to escape has already traced a channel to wards the narrow sand bank which rises from the beach, and it is pro-"], [42, "38 OBSERVATIONS UPON babie that in a sew years the Barra Chica will be again opened near the outlet. The planters have also resolved to dig across the beach and complete the opening of the inlet, the fresh waters having de stroyed their oyster banks and prevented the sea fish from com ing up. Passing the narrows the course of the creek or channel meanders through the extensive marshes to the junction of Hernan dez's and Pellicer's creeks, about six or seven miles from the bar of Matanzas and two miles less from the Barra Chica. The former stream twelve miles further south heads in Graham's swamp : Hit latter is navigable some miles beyond Pellicer's house to where the King's road formerly crossed it on a bridge, long since destroyed, and heads far back in the pine lands : in Sawmill swamp, three or four miles from Pellicer's point it receives a large addition from the drain of Cawcaw swamp, wherein Moses's creek lately mentioned also takes its rise. The character of almost all the land between St Augustine and Pellicer's is indifferent : narrow skirts of hammocl fringe the borders of the creeks, and every spot of good land is co vered by some title or other, many tracts having been successive!} owned and abandoned by the unlucky and ignorant attempters at cul tivation. The plantations of Mr. Hernandez, Mr. Perpall, and Mr. Pellicer are good, and the marsh and savanna lands in their vi cinity when banked and drained would produce fine crops of sugar ii their vicinity to St. Augustine should tempt any one to undertake the great labour. The grounds planted by Mr. Hernandez, are the northern point of a long narrow hammock called Graham. swamp, extending a6 far as the Tomoca ferry (about thirty miles I its avernge breadth is scarcely three fourths of a mile. Colonel Bil low, a rich planter of South Carolina has made extensive purchases upon this swamp, and is preparing with a large spree to establish considerable sugar plantations. On its east side scrub lands and saw palmettos extend to the Atlantic : On its west immense tracts of pine land spread to the river St. John : parallel and"], [43, "THE FLORIDAS. 39 at a short distance therefrom runs the main road southwardly which is in general good, and has been lately cleared out and made passable for a waggon* being one of the only three roads in the pro vince which affords practicable travelling for any mode of conveyance but horses : Eight miles beyond Pellicer's creek is a considerable run of water, with the remains of astupenduous mill-dam, construct ed formerly by a Mr. Bernardino Sanchez : approaching Tomoca one or two other creeks intervene, being the head waters of Smith's and Ormond's creeks. All the good land with one or two excep tions has already been taken up. Upon Tomoca river was former ly an old ferry and the road to the town of New Smyrna proceeded on: it is now quite grown up. Haul-over creek and Tomoca river form the head of Halifax river or Mosquito north lagoon : The junction of the two latter forms an acute promotory called Mount Oswald : Haul-over creek proceeeds northerly, its western branch or Smith's creek heads in Graham's awamp, near which it receives Ormond's creek, and another tributary water : the eastern branch skirts the sea and near its head is scarce a furlong from it across which boats are hauled by the fishermen : this haul-over is only fifteen miles from the bar of Matanzas. From Mount Oswald, Halifax river runs straight for upwards of sixteen miles two points to the eastward of south : its average breadth is about three quarters of a mile as far as Snake island and Orange grove : here a low marshy projection denominated the isl and encroaches from the main upon the uniformity of the river's width reducing it to less than half a mile at this northern point ofa bay ; within which is a stone house, being the last permanent inhab ited building on the coast between St. Augustine and cape Florida : it is occupied by a poor couple who seem to live in much poverty : Mr. Anderson an enterprising planter from South Carolina has 40 or 50 hands employed in raising cotton at the Orange Grove plantation. four miles south of this are the Pelican islands, from whence the ri ver loses its open character, and winds among an innumerable clus-"], [44, "40 OBSERVATIONS UrON ter of mangrove islands down to the bar of Mosquito, hugging the At lantic shore : next the main are a variety of intricate passages con necting with each other and indenting the land : three separate creeks penetrate the interior a little way, all being in some measure connected with Spruce creek: some considerable quantity of good land lies scattered about these waters, but too low for cul tivation without much labour. The whole of the 4and sit for agriculture, from Tomoca to Spruce creek, has been granted away : the main body of it consists in a hammock which appears to be a continuation of Graham's swamp, running parallel to Halifax river a mile or two back, and one or two eligible tracts on the river above the Pelican islands : the narrow skirt of land between the river and the ocean is totally useless. Mosquito or New Smyrna entrance is narrow, but affords water for vessels drawing ten feet : the anchorage is good inside and on the south shore a vessel may lay alongside and make fist to the man groves within a mile ofthe bar. The scite of the abandoned town of New Smyrna is five miles from the inlet, but presents no bluff or elevation on the river, and is shut out from the sea breeze by the cluster of mangrove islands in front. These islands are thickly spread between the narrow beach and the main land over a space from two to five miles in width : one channel on the west keeps next the main : the eastern one after a very crooked course conducts to Turtle Mount or Mount Tucker, the summit of which is about 00 feet above the level of Hillsborough river, as the channel is called. It is a vast collection of shells chiefly oysters which appear to be the work of Indians of other days. Three miles further south is a beau tiful body of hammock land called the Cigeras, which is perhaps un equalled by any in Florida : there appears to be about one thousand acres in a body. A few miles further south conduct to the entrance of Mosquito south lagoon, where the western passage also enters. This piece of water appears to average eight or ten miles in width,"], [45, "THE FLORIDAS. 41 and nearly thirty in length : with the exception of a few scattering mangrove islands on the Atlantic side it is quite open : halfway down on the western side it is separated from Indian river by a narrow isthmus which is only 1980 feet wide, called the Haulover, across which canoes and boats are continually hauled. A canal could be made here at an expense not exceeding one thousand dollars, which would thereby complete a good inland navigation for upwards of two hundred miles. Nearly all the good lands between this place and Spruce creek northerly have been granted away, but the loca- tion of them is not so certain : from the nature of the ground the tracts lie in two parallel lines ; the front on Hillsborough river and Mosquito Lagoon forming one range, and Turnbull's back swamp the other : this latter is situated back a few miles, extending from Spruce creek and gradually shaping its course to the head of Indian river. The main stream of the last water has one of its sources in this swamp ; the other one called the North-west branch comes from the N. N. W. and has a large body of good land about it, upon which claims by grants exist, but the location is very doubtful. There appears but little doubt that the head of this N. W. branch of Indian river and the head lake of St. John's river, approach each other very near heading in the same savanna or marsh : there has always been a tradition of an existing communication between these two, which an inspection ofthe map will explain. From the union of this branch with the main river along the western shore, as far down as eight miles below the Haulover the land is rich, but encumbered with grants of some kind, many of which however there is reason to believe are unlocated. Indian river is a beautiful sheet of water : at the Haulover, it is three or four miles wide, and so continues a long distance north ward : in a southern direction it expands on the eastern side, and a collection of mangrove islands skirt the shores as far as cape Cana veral. Fifteen miles from the Haulover is the north end of Merits*: si"], [46, "42 OBSERVATIONS UPON island, which stands in the centre of the Lagoon parallel to the shores, with abroad stream each side. For more than forty miles it divide* the river, which averages three miles in breadth. On the main or western side is the proper channel : the eastern branch is shallow and its upper end spreads with flats and mangrove islands, confusing the navigator and impeding the passage of all but small canoes. The average extent across Meritt's island is two miles at least, which gives upwards of 50,000 acres ; this is said to have been granted to Mr. Mclntosh of Georgia, and now belongs to Colonel Clinch ofthe United States army. The quality ofthe land on the main is various but in general good and improving as progress is made towards tilt south ; the shores beginning to present an elevated appearance: bluffs of shell rock rear themselves close on the river ; the flatness visible over all the preceding country begins to disappear : the foundation is rock under vegetable mould ; upon the surface is shell stone ; limestone and slate is found in detached spots, anil all the geological signs indicate an approach to a higher and more healthy region. Indeed after arriving at Meritt's island, there can be but little doubt that the country is upon the river free from those causes which produce bilious and intermittent complaints. The grants here are less close to each other : the principal one is to a Mr. Delespine, which was regularly made previous to the pe riod stipulated in the treaty in return for supplies furnished the gar rison at various periods : it has been regularly located and the lines distinctly marked out by blazed trees. It is upon the back of this and the adjoining tracts that was discovered an immense savan na through which the waters supplying the source of the river St. John apparently flow. At a perpendicular distance of something less than three miles from the bank of Indian river, its eastern side is struck, and it presents a breadth of at least twelve miles. From the top of the high pine trees on the margin, the course of waters may be traced apparently a few miles distant, nearest the wes!"], [47, "THE FLORIDAS. 43 boundaries of the great prairie, beyond which the pine'.voods raise their heads. On Indian river some of the best hammocks in the Floridas are to be met with, healthy and elevated : the occasioned breaks of pine bluffs are rather advantageous than otherwise as pre senting better scites for settlements. During the last twenty miles of the extent of Meritt's island, the west branch of Indian river is not more than from one and a half to two miles wide, being at the northern end six or seven : immediately opposite the south of the island which is a narrow point of rock and mangroves, is St. Anto nio river or Elbow creek : a low rocky shore on each side orna mented with tufts of hammocks and a large entrance cove give it an handsome appearance : but immediately behind the hammock and pine lands, the stream is only to be navigated back two or three miles when it heads in a swamp, beyond which is a Savanna. The south entrance to the east channel of Indian river is scarce ly 400 yards wide ; the banks a mile up however recede towards the beach, and it afterwards becomes near three miles across, to within ten miles of cape Canaveral, where it is but a trifling distance over the beach to the sea. Somewhat beyond, a promontory divides the water into two prongs ; the westward continues on till the channel is lost in the archipelago of mangrove keys at the north end of Me ritt's island ; the other comes immediately behind the cape, between which and the south side of the Mosquito lagoon is a large lake of fresh water. The navigation on this east side of the island is ex tremely confused, and many shipwrecked persons attempting with their crafts to find an inland passage have lost their course, and be ing compelled to abandon their boats, have endeavored to travel along the beach, upon which they have been known to expire in the agonies of thirst, while the pond just alluded to was near them, and when a hole scratched on the sands but a, few inches above the reach of the waves would have produced them excellent fresh wa ter ; which may be also thus procured along every part of the Flo-"], [48, "44 OBSERVATIONS UPON rida coast, both on the sea beach and the Lagoon banks ; but in ma ny unfortunate cases it has been unknown. Two miles south of St. Antonio river is Crane creek, of which none of the persons who have previously navigated Indian rivet were aware ; its mouth is almost covered by a point of land, lap ping over, leaving a small narrow entrance on the south, not twen ty yards across. Crane creek for half a mile up is wide, but it is soon confined in a narrow run, through a strip of marsh bordered by pine lands and heading in a piece of swamp ; the sloping banks how ever in general are high, with fine tall pitch pine trees at large dis tances, the undergrowth grass with scattering shrubs, presenting in sailing up a handsome appearance resembling a European park. Game of all kinds is abundant, and as in all the other waters there appears great plenty offish. This remark upon the pine lands here is applicable to many spots. Two miles south St. Andre's river or Turkey creek empties into the lagoon ; its right bank is altogether pine ; on the left for a very short way some hammock scrub and spruce is to be found ; it is but a small distance up that it separates into two springs, soon terminating in little swamps, having passed through high pine land. Immediately beyond the mouth of this creek are the Turkej bluffs, of rich yellow sand and forty feet in height, extending a mile in length ; this terminates the general low rocky shore which was predominant from within about twenty miles of the Haulover ; a trifling distance further on the bluff is of shells with a scrub ham mock, the northern sand bluff being covered with pines, and having a luxuriant under brush of oak and hickory scrub. The Turkej bluffs present one of the most healthy and beautiful spots to he met with on the eastern coast ofFlorida for houses ; they are supposed to be the same as the hills marked in most of the charts, \" Las Tor tolas.\" Pelican island is a small mangrove key eight miles south of Turkey creek, nearest the west shore ; the beach from Meritt's"], [49, "THE FLORIDAS. 45 island is bare of tall growth with only one tuft of tall pines, and one ofcabbage trees, and no mangrove trees or bushes until thus far when they recommence. Five miles below is the mouth of St. Sebastian river, distant altogether eighteen miles from the south end of Meritt's island, and distinguished by a high red sand bluff on the south point of entrance. This stream like the three preceding ones has pine lands alone on its banks, which are in general very high bluffs of light colored sand. It comes from the S. S. E. in a very serpentine course, having its head among the flats, Savannas and ponds which lie parallel to the Indian river narrows, there ex tending southwardly. The whole western shore from some miles north of Elbow creek, past St Sebastian river, and down to the vicinity of the narrows which are eleven miles beyond St. Sebastian, is in general pine land, but elevated and healthy with the opposite beach free from mangrove bushes, and therefore receiving the full action of the breeze from the sea, the shore of which is in general four miles distant, three of which are occupied by the breadth of Indian river. Passing the narrows which are three miles through, and something more than a quarter wide, the pine lands recede from the west front of the Lagoon which is covered by fine marshes half a mile wide, beyond which is a low hammock of rich growth, and the character is retained as far as opposite to the bar of the river, a distance of thir teen miles : upon the beach side near the narrows are occasional pieces of good hammock, but the east bank of the river thence is fringed with mangroves and a line of islands of the same to the out let, which is approached through a narrow channel two miles through among thick mangrove keys. The marshes are covered with the plant called pursley, and contain almost a solid body of clay : they are several feet above the surface of the water. The whole of this pine extent may contain about eight thousand acres, being one of the largest bodies of good' soil to be met with. Fine hammocks with"], [50, "46 OBSERVATIONS UPON in general elevated scites, are found along from Indian river bar to the mouth of St. Lucie river ; but like all the others observed on or near the water courses of East Florida, their breadth seems limited to half a mile. The bay is several miles wide in this extent, with occasionally on the beach patches of good hammock land, among some of which are to be traced old fields and other indications of former settlements : the Gap sixteen miles from the bar is remarka ble, giving at sea the appearance of an inlet : on the sea shore are the rocks of St. Lucie directly fronting the mouth of that river, indi cating its position, and chiefly to be noted from the adjoining strand being called the money bank : a vessel with dollars having been lost here, coin has occasionally been found on the beach, and the tradi tion has sent many to search this mine, which however like manj similar expeditions seems only to end in disappointment. The majestic appearance of St. Lucie river affords at first sight the greatest expectations : disembogueing, by a mouth nearly a mile in width, its volume of waters into a wide and extensive bay, it gives the idea of its having traversed along region from the west, perhaps originating in the much talked of lake Mayaco, which like the foun tain of youth has never yet been found. The view of the first few miles of ascent is imposing ; on the north, a high rocky hill binding a rich vegetable soil, extending some distance back from the shore and six or seven miles along it ; a fine hammock growth of heavj timber presenting a beautiful appearance ; on the opposite side the bank is equally high, but covered with pine growth mixed with oak and hickory scrub ; between them a river whose breadth admittinga free circulation of sea air, at once convinces the traveller that on such a place health must reside. At the forks ten miles from the mouth, the perspective isremarkablj striking ; from the points of land three large sheets of water spread to wards different points, and though pine is the prevalent growth of the river banks, yet it is of a good quality and affords a variety of places"], [51, "47 THE FLORIDAS. ivhere fruit culture would succeed; a fact which may no doubt hereaf ter populate this country with a race of industrious whiles whom the healthiness of the spot may allure hither. The south branch of St. Lucie extends only about four miles when it stops suddenly and a larrow creek covered with a green mantle of water plants alone re nains, heading in a small swamp ; the northern branch may continue en or twelve miles in a N.W. direction, when it also suddenly, con- Tacts in a similar manner and heads in a swamp beyond which sa rannas and ponds run parallel to the sea shore towards the head of St. Sebastian river. The banks every where except the large ham- mocks .at the mouth are covered with pines : two or three miles S. W. of the forks is a body of hammock, and pine lands beyond that again to the borders of a flat savanna country. Proceeding to trace the inland navigation southwardly, some miles Deyond St; Lucie river are found Jupiter narrows, connecting the sound or bay of Indian river with that of Jupiter or Hobe ; they ire eight or ten miles in length, with several narrow channels .hrough a body of mangrove islands lying between the sea beach and he main land, on which latter are to be found small pieces of low -ammock well adapted for sugar. The western shore of Jupiter sound presents a series of ve ry high sand hills with undulating tops covered with forests of low spruce pines ; one swell of high ground rising above the rest is call ed on marine charts the Bleach-yard, from the large spots of land un covered by vegetation, presenting to the coasting mariner the ap pearance of linen spread out on the hills upon the side next the beach; beautiful piece of land reaches from the mouth of the narrows four miles, with a low rocky bluff generally on the river ; it may contain about 1000 acres of first rate hammock, a part of which was cultivated many years since by an old Spaniard named Padre Torre, and more re cently was planted by one Hutchinson, with cocoa nuts, limes,-plan tains, bananas, oranges, &c. which are said by the pilots to be still in"], [52, "48 OBSERVATIONS UPON good bearing, though the place has been many years quite abandoned and grown up in thick bush. From this hammock is sour miles to Jupi. ter inlet which is now closed. Three large rivers coming altogether through a pine countrj, discharge into Grenville sound immediately at the south end o! Jupiter bay, but the large body of water has too sluggish a currenl to force open the inlet which is closed by the sand, though opened occasionally by accidental circumstances. The three streams are distinguished as Grenville river on the north, Middle river, and Ju piter creek on the south ; the latter as well as Fresh-water creel near the bar, have some connexion with the fresh water lakt which approaches within sour miles of Jupiter, by means of la goons and marshes, through which a channel might easily be dug; thereby with another short cut on the south, making a complete though intricate communication practicable at least for boats, from cape Florida and the keys to within forty miles of St. Augustine ; at will appear by the subsequent parts of this report, and a referenct to the map now publishing. This lake is thirty-five or forty miles in length, with marshes al its south end, which contain a body of such fine sugar land, that it will not be long ere it is brought into cultivation, and the canal that i made to drain it will finish the only remaining part of the inland navi gation, connecting the south end of fresh water lake with the north end of Rio Seco ; which spot is indicated by an orange grove neat the beach, to which from Jupiter inlet the present mode of access, i by hauling the boat or canoe across at both places, the intermediali distance of forty-five miles being run along the coast at sea. The Rio Seco winds in a very serpentine course through a boJj of marsh at first, and latterly mangrove islands to its mouth, which is closed at present like that of Jupiter ; the place where the outlet was is also called Boca Ratone and Dry inlet ; patches of hammock are occasionally to be found on the main side, but the chief growtb"], [53, "THE FLORIDAS. 49 is pine ; a mile or two west in the woods is the large lake which gives rise to Jupiter creek. Boca Ratone sound receives also from the south another creek, heading in large marsh flats, but with deep water ; the whole of which together with that from the Rio Seco, unable to discharge itself over the dry inlet, has forced itself by a natural canal through a neck of high land into the Middle river at the place where a stream called the Potomac runs into it ; the rush of the wa ter through this narrow channel is very great, the current driving with a velocity capable ofgivingmotion to the largest wheels, and upon it several saw-mills might work with advantage, should the Florida pitch pine which is abundantly supplied by the adjacent woods, ever become in sufficient demand as lumber. The Potomac river, as the few occasional visitors here have named it, is merely the head of Middle river, its course is through a pine country of good quality, heading in swamps and Savannas, and connected with the Great Glade which will be described. The outlet of Middle river is now better known as Hillsborough, and a precisely similar communication exists from hence to New ri ver, as the north route to Boca Ratone. New river and all the branches discharging through its bar originate in the Great Glade, running through pine lands and heading in cypress swamps, which have previously been inundated from the Glade : the inland com munication from New river to cape Florida, is from the head of New riverto the head of the Rio Ratones through the Glade. On the form er are some occasional spots of good land, with elevated pine lands, healthy and of good quality. The Ratones discharge into the head of the Bay of Key Biscayne, somewhat as delineated in the latest charts of the Florida coast, but no good land is to be found except immediately behind Cape Florida, where a small piece of hammock exists on the high rocky front generally, as upon Key Biscayne Bank : a little further south, strips of similar growth are occasionally to be 7"], [54, "50 OBSERVATIONS UPO.V sound, but beyond all are pine lands and mangroves, as far as the Ticinity of cape Sable, and even there but in very small quantities. From cape Sable to cape Romano, the land is low with mangroFe bushes, closing the banks of small streams draining from the Great j Glade, with small pieces of hammock and long necks of pine land intermixed. Forests of pine are known to extend on the coast from cape Romano to Charlotte harbour, intermixed with excellent pie ces of hammock, but beyond that it is not pretended to make an; statement in this report. The Glade, or as it is emphatically termed the Never Glade, appeals to occupy almost the whole interior from about the parallel ot Jupi ter inlet to cape Florida, thence round to cape Sable to which point it approaches very near, and northwardly as far as the Dela ware river discharging into Charlotte bay : its general appearance is a flat sandy surface mixed in the large stones anil rocks, with from six inches to two feet of water lying upon it, in which is a growth oi saw, and other water grasses, so thick as to impede the passage oi boats where there is no current. Over this are a number of islands and promontories, many of which are altogether of hammock growth, with mixtures of pine and cabbage tree land, each spot doubtless capable in some degree of cultivation ; but deteriorated by being pla ced in a situation so difficult of access, and exhibiting so forbidding an aspect, that for the present the attempts to penetrate across have been repelled, and the dissatisfied traveller has been sent back una ble to complete the object of his mission, and confused in his effort to tread the mazes of this labyrinth of morasses. Towards its northern end however it contracts considerably, and then changes somewhat of its character by assuming the appearance of an open cypress pond, which extends to the great swamp and savanna at the head of the river St. John and Ocklawaha, and here is a passage across ; sot it is a well ascertained fact, corroborated particularly in the author's last voyage undertaken on the Peninsula, that the crossing place of"], [55, "THE FLORIDAS. 51 the Indians is made in a direction west of Jupiter inlet, and in their travels from the nation, by crossing the Haffia or Manatee river, and journeying in a S. E. course along the edge of the savanna swamp or morass to the narrowest spot, the passage over which oc cupies three days continued travel in water. The determination of the circumstance of this immense body of low land occupying the whole southern interior of East Florida, easi ly affords an explanation of those delineations upon antient maps, re presenting it as cut up by rivers and lagoons, communicating with each other and the sea ; and it is by no means improbable that the knowledge of its existence, prevented the late government from com mencing settlements in a country of so little promise, for had the re gions boasted of as equal to Cuba existed here, there is enough of speculation in that island, to have improved the land of promise long before this period. On looking back over the preceding pages the reader must be struck with the reflection, that the sources from whence the various water courses of the Eastern coast of Florida originate, are not the pure springs of a hilly region, but a series of connected reservoirs, from whence exude in languid streams their vast collections of wa ters, a circumstance which under the almost tropical sun of this country might produce eternal diseases, had not the provident hand of nature raised a border of high lands nearly all around upon the sea coast of considerable breadth, and sent the never failing eastern wind to drive back the miasm\u00e6 to the interior : this belt appears to average five or six miles across including varieties of soil ; and while the future settlers upon the east coast of Florida, may be assured of no sickness assailing them from the marsh behind, they are protect ed from the encroachments of, and inconveniences attendant on a direct exposure to the ocean, by a narrow strip of land intervening between the sea and the long lagoons, that run in a parallel direction"], [56, "52 OBSERVATIONS UPON to the coast, on its whole extent nearly, affording an inland navigation almost uninterrupted and which cannot but soon be fully perfected. The Florida reef and chain of keys commence at Key Biscayne or cape Florida. They are sufficiently interesting to be made the subject of a separate section, and therefore we go at once to cape Sable, the southern promontocy on the side of the gulf of Mexico, The advantages on this western side are not so equal, as in general from cape Sable to punta Largo, the land is low and covered with man groves ; north of the latter promontory the belt around the central marsh is wider, and a succession of high pine lands with rich ham mocks thickly intermixed, and a similar coast to that upon the Atlan tic, make the extent as far as Tampa bay on a level with it in most points. Immediately off cape Sable within musket shot of the shore, is a safe anchorage at all times in nine feet water. At Cape Sable or punta Tancha there are actually three capes, at the middle one of which are fresh water wells : these wells are distinguished by a tuft of button trees or white mangroves, being the only trees on the point. The land at these capes and for some miles eastwardly is verj good ; of a rich grey soil thickly mixed in with broken shells, pre senting an even surface like a meadow, without a bush -. this was called many years ago the Yamasee old field, but there appears every reason to suppose it a natural prairie Behind this strip of land which is but narrow, rise hammocks of the usual width, and beyond a boundless savanna, the soil of which is richly alluvial and perfectly dry for a great distance ; but mingling at length with the Ever Glades. Among the numerous tropical productions in the hammocks are a few trees called Huava, of the palm family, from the leaves of which the sine straw Havana hats are made: some live oaks and vines of an amazing size. If coffee can be produced"], [57, "53 THE FLORIDAS. at all in Florida, this is the spot where it may be expected to suc ceed. Cape Sable creek, immediately north of punta Tancha runs up in about an E. N E. course through mangrove islands, marsh and clusters of hammocks, among the growth of which are cedar and small mahogany ; it spreads occasionally into lakes, and heads like all the other streams in the Eternal Glades. The bight between cape Sable and punta Largo, or cape Romano, is called the bay of Juan Ponce de Leon, the upper or northern part being known as Chatham bay : here the Delaware or Gallivan's river discharges itself over a bar of eight feet water. This is a beau tiful stream, and its high banks present most eligible scites for a town ; the lands on each side are represented as rich and luxuriant ; it heads in lake Macaco, or at all events in large lagoons in the re cesses of the Ever Glade morass. Immediately under cape Romano is anchorage for vessels of ten feet : from the cape to bay Carlos the coast is low, with forests of pine coming almost down to the edge of the sea. The river Coo lasahatchie is the only stream of importance between these places. Charlotte harbour has four inlets formed by a chain of islands ; upon the bar of the largest entrance is sixteen feet water. The bay within is spacious and sheltered ; it receives the waters ofCharlotte river, a large and powerful stream with several large branches, and heading in lake Macaco. Although this lake is laid down on the map. yet its existence does not appear to have been actually ascer tained by recent observations : so many former accounts however speak of it, giving it a location, that it has not been thought proper to omit it altogether, for there must be various collections of water in the Ever Glades, which to the eye of a hasty traveller might well appear as lakes and lagoons. Between Charlotte harbour and Tampa bay the land is double, that is, an inland navigation is afforded between the ocean and the main land by a chain of islands : this is"], [58, "54 OBSERVATIONS UPON not quite complete, but the coast partakes more of the character of the Atlantic seaboard than it has hitherto done. Spirito Santo or Tampa bay is a spacious harbour, admitting vessels of twenty-four feet draught of water: it penetrates the coast u nearly an easterly direction, being some miles in width ; at its upper end it divides ; the north-western is called Tampa bay proper, the north-eastern takes the designation of Hillsborough bay. Tampa bay proper is only a shallow lagoon which receives no tributary waters ; two or three rivers discharge into Hillsborough bay. Tbe various contradictory names given to them at different times, render it difficult to determine what are their respective true appellations, The lands upon Spirito Santo bay are low, but immediately back to the north-east they rise into beautiful undulations to the east and south-east. The plains of the Haffia are fertile, extensive and pleas. ing. There appears but little doubt that the savannas and Ion grounds at the head of this river extend to and connect with those, whence emanate the Ocklawaha and St. John's rivers, a circum stance that will be more apparent when the interior of the count.) is described. From Tampa bay to the mouth of the Amisura river the coast it low, and the entrance to that stream is very shallow and extremely difficult to find : it is much to be lamented that so sine a watei should have so shallow an outlet ; it forks a few miles up, the N.E. branch heading up the near skirts of what is known as the Alachui country ; the S. E. branches receive the waters from the large bodies of hammock and other rich land, lying near the present Indian towns, meandering through a beautiful region. A very wide and shallow bay extends from the mouth of the Amisura to that of the Suwanee : the coast is low and broken, and clusters of small keys are spread along. Several minor streams fall into the northern part of this large indentation, which receives the particular denomina tion of Vacasassy bay, from an antient Indian village in that vicinity."], [59, "55 THE FLORIDAS. The Suwanee, formerly called the San Juan, and corrupted by the Indian negroes to its present appellation, is a magnificent river ; by the quantity of mud and sand from the fresh water brought down, a large bar has been formed at the mouth, and the land ap pears like the Missisippi, by the alluvial depositions, to have en croached upon the sea. A low coast covered with cabbage trees intervenes to the entrance of the Chattahatchie or Saint Pedro river, which comes from the northward, heading about the Georgia lines, near the-'place where antient Spanish settlements once existed. Some miles further west the Ausilly, a handsome stream, falls into the bay of Appalachie ; its source is in the western parts of Georgia ; heavy inundations in the rainy seasons cover the banks of these wa ters for many miles, and render a circuitous route to fort St. Marks absolutely necessary. The estuary at the head of the Bay of Appalachie receives-two small rivers, at the junction of which is placed the small fortifica tion of St. Marks : this post has never increased beyond a military position, to which the troops were generally confined : a trading house for the Indians has generally been established here. St. Mark's ri ver heads some few miles to the N. E. at the Mickasukee towns, and the Wackhulla or Tngabona at the Talahassie hammocks near the scite of the old settlements of St. Louis. The Ocklockonne Bay re ceives the waters of the river of that name and of several smaller streams ; and there is an inland navigation to New river which is continued along St. George's sound to the mouth of the Appalachico la river, which is the true boundary of East and West Florida. The lower parts of the rivers are subject to very deep and an nual inundations, but the whole country from the Georgia line, many miles south from the bluff on the Appalachicola to the banks of the Suwanee is covered with fine rich hammocks, which have a great reputation for fertility. It is upon all the ungranted lands between these two latter rivers, that a project has been made, and probably"], [60, "56 OBSERVATIONS UPON will be executed for the purpose of concentrating all the Indians of both Floridas. St. Joseph's bay and inlet is the first harbour in West Florida after doubling cape St. Bias ; it may be used as a shelter from hur ricanes or violent gales with much advantage for small vessels, as may also St. Andrew's bay, which is a deep estuary with several arms receiving the waters of Ekanfinna river. Santa Rosa inlet, thirty miles further to the westward, conducts to the bay of that name, which is of very great extent. The Choc tawhatchie river, and all its tributary streams discharge into the east ern end of this bay ; and near the western end a number of small boggy creeks drain the vallies of the adjacent pine lands. An inland navigation behind Santa Rosa Island conducts to the ce lebrated harbour of Pensacola, which spreading two large arm) deep into the interior collects the Yellow water river, Middle ri ver and its numerous branches ; the Escambia and its labyrinth of adjacent waters, and several smaller and less important streams. Upon a dry healthy point of land and fronting the ocean is buili the town of Pensacola, which only wants the hand of protection ap plied, and the spirit of enterprise diffused over it to cause its in crease and prosperity : possessing a deep entrance and notwith standing its recent severe affliction, having every assurance of health, it might become the depot for all those productions which are no* placed at Mobile : a very small canal would unite the two bays, and thus open the channel for the tide of commerce : but this can only be expected by the union of both towns under the same state government. Before proceeding to a description ofthe interior of the provinces, the author claims the privilege ofintroducing a few remarks on the political connexion between East and West Florida, which have arisen from a review of the attendant circumstances, and as it con tains the concurrent opinions of many well wishers to both provin ces, he offers it respectfully to the public."], [61, "57 THE FLORIDA-!. West Florida has heen gradually pared down to the present rem taant : the large portions of country which have successively fallen to the share of Louisiana, Missisippi and Alabama have left bnt a narrow strip of land between the Perdido and Appalachicola rivers : and deprived of its original ports of New-Orleans and Mobile, West Florida must, like Poland, be distributed among the adjoining states : it will disappear from the map of America, by the ultimate annexa tion of Pensacola and the remaining portion of territory to Alabama, a step called for by reason and polity. That such a course must be highly desirable for East Florida, will be readily acknowledged on a consideration of the subject : and it can easily be conceded, that it will not in anywise interfere with the national question of the entrance of another state into the Union. From their more geographical juxta-position, East and West Flo rida have been perhaps considered by those at a distance as integral ly united : that this is by no means the case is but too well known to their inhabitants ; for so dissimilar are their opinions, that even in this early stage of their independent existence, dissensions and discor dance have sprung up, which a separate administration instead of conciliating appears rather to have tended to foster, and the dispute as to the seat of territorial government has already assumed a deci ded shape. The eligible intended location of the Florida Indians between the Appalachicola and Suwanee rivers, will in addition to the present obstructed communication, place an Indian country between East and West Florida, and thus consummate the separation, which will then only want the fiat of Congress to render politically permanent. The annexation of West Florida to Alabama will not add another 'epresentative in Congress to the latter commonwealth, nor will it irevent Florida from assuming its place in the Federal Union in lue tima, by abstracting so much population ; for it is towards East"], [62, "58 OBSERVATIONS UPON Florida alone that the great mass of emigration will roll ; the warm er latitudes ot the peninsula hold out anticipations of more lucrative productions than West Florida : that country not extending beyond the parallel already tried by our citizens, cannot present attractions superior to the region between lake Borgne and Mobile, where is found a soil at all events equal to any in West Florida. Why should the Federal Government be burthened at present with a double set of officers ? Or why should the members of the territorial legislature, be alternately condemned to emigrate as it were to each extreme of the country. At presentwhile the popula tion of West Florida is but few, it can be but a matter of indifference to any but the residents of Pensacola, whether they obey the lam of Alabamaor Florida ; their rights are in either case equal ; and the views of those who look for the aggrandizement of Pensacola, by the disunion of the trade of the interior from the bay of Mobile to that of the former place, can only be realized by an annexation to Ala bama. Pensacola can never be the seat of government ; and while its citizens claim an imaginary honor, by seeking to keep it under its antient rules, they prevent the very advantages they sigh for. On casting a view over the map of the United States, the most un reflecting observer must be struck with the mere geographical pro priety of the annexation ; a step that would relieve the general go vernment of a contribution, accelerate the organization of West Flo rida, diminish the coming taxes, and take a dead weight from off the remaining part of the territory. As a matter of general interest to both provinces, it may be re marked that under the present organization, the governor cannotgife his attention to one section without detriment to the other, and where the laws of Congress require certain oaths and formalities to be made before him by the territorial officers, months may elapse and the public iuterests suffer ere it can be done. In thus hastily marking a few of the principle reasons for the an-"], [63, "THE FLORIDAS. 59 nexation, the author deprecates the idea of being supposed to ad vocate the interests of East, at the expense of those of West Florida : he is perfectly convinced that it would be to their mutual advantage in every respect, and appeals to their own good sense to confirm that such is the case. Having in the preceding pages briefly sketched an outline of the coast, we may proceed to examine the interior by counties, into which it has lately been divided by the legislative council of Florida. Escambia County comprehends all that part of West Florida lying between the Perdido and Appalachicola rivers, with Pensacola as the seat of justice. In the immediate neighbourhood of this city the character of the land is dry and sandy, its scite having been chosen for health. The good lands on the Coenecuh and Escambia rivers do not begin until their forks at Miller's, the lower parts being sub ject to be overflown ; the same holds good of the other waters dis charging into the bay of Pensacola. Immense ridges of pine lands fill up the space from the banks of the Yellow Water to the Choc tawhatchie, but on the head branches of both these rivers, near the northern line of the province, good lands are to be found, which will doubtless repay the labour of the industrious planter. There are many Indian paths through this county, one particu larly leading from near the mouths of the Choctawhatchie, all along the sea beach to the Signal tower at the entrance of Pensacola harbour : another traverses the pine ridges from the Coosada old town to the east point opposite the city of Pensacola : another leads from the same place, going round the heads of the branches of the Yellow-water, Middle and Coenecuh rivers. This latter river is navigable for small craft to the northward of the dividing line of the 31st degree of north latitude between Florida- and Alabama, though the tide flows up but a few miles. The Choctawhatchie and its"], [64, "60 OBSERVATIONS UPON principal tributary branches are likewise navigable as far up as the Coosada old town nearly, and the produce will readily find its waj to Pensacola, by way of Santa Rosa sound. The former harbour abounds with fine scale and shell fish, but a vessel lying in its waters not coppered would be ruined in two months by the worms : craft obliged to remain there ought to he hove down, cleaned and payed once in five or six weeks. It is more than probable that the northern parts of this and the adjacent counties of Jackson and Duval, are subject in the autumn to those bilious intermittent disorders known commonly at the south as the country fevers. So entirely continental is their situation that it cannot be expected they are different ; but the deep indenta tion of the salt waters of Pensacola and Santa Rosa bays, with the high sandy ridges in their vicinities, induce an expectation of health, The last summer has most unfortunately desolated the town of Pen. sacola, but this is the first time such a calamity has been known there, and without attempting to enter into the doctrine of importa tion or local generation of yellow fever, we may naturally infer that the origin of that fatal disorder was in this instance far from being local. Respecting the culture most favourable for the soil of Escambia county, the trials in the neighbourhood of Mobile will best decide: it is certainly a fact that there is a greater degree of cold in this part of Florida than on the same parallel on the Atlantic coast, though not so much more as to prevent the cultivation of the sugar cane on favourable spots ; but it appears undoubted that the varie ties of the grape may be introduced, and by a judicious culture be made much more profitable than can be expected from cotton, whose daily declining price forcibly tells us that the growth is far beyond the demand, and no alteration is apparently to take place for some time. It cannot however be disguised that fertility is by no mean*"], [65, "THE FLORIDAS. 61 he general characteristic of Escambia county, although many spots ire to be found equal to the most favoured situations in the southern :ountries. Jackson County comprehends the remainder of West Florida, to which in order as it were to amalgamate the two provinces, a large section from East Florida has been annexed, extending as far as the Suwanee. The characteristics of the seaboard of this county are similar to those of Escambia, as far at least as cape St. Bias : the line of dis tinction between the upper and lower parts of the district thus far is distinctly traced by a chain of hilly lands of a romantic character. 'ver the Ekanfinna river is a natural bridge of rocks, a singularity hich distinguishes several parts of Florida. North of the Weemico and in the forks between the Chamiooly and Appilachicola rivers, are extensive tracts of fertile land : over the Chamiooly is another natural bridge, and a series of small Indian towns, one built on the right bank of the latter as far up almost as the Alabama line ; this region is extremely well watered, but from its geographical position must be subject to the annual endemics of the adjacent territories. The Appalachicola river has near its mouth, many channels to discharge the vast volumes of water brought down ; upon these islands rich crops of rice and sugar may doubtless be raised, as well as upon the adjacent banks. The town of Colinton is laid off on Prospect bluff, where sort Gad-sden, better known as the Negro fort once stood : it was here that a large body of refugee slaves took a desperate stand, and were almost wholly annihilated by the blowing up of their magazine when attacked by the troops of the United States. This town will probably become a commercial place, though the bar here having but twelve feet water, will prove as in gome other parts of Florida, a serious drawback. The large region between the Appalachicola and St. Mark's rivers,"], [66, "62 OBSERVATIONS UPON bounded northwardly by the old Indian path from the Spanish bluffs to that sort, is the purchase made by the house of Panton, Leslie and Co. which is now known under the firm of John Forbes it Co. of Matanzas in the island ofCuba; it is commonly called Forbes's pur chase, having been bought by that house from the Indians under the sanction of the Spanish government, for vast debts due by the va rious Indians at the respective trading houses of the firm in Florida, of which they had an exclusive monopoly ; the northern parts of this purchase are very sine lands, which character extends to the Geor gia boundary. There are of course large tracts of pine, but these are by no means of the worst quality. A variety of rich grounds stretch in a N. E. direction from this tract to the Mikasukie towns, and at the banks of the Ocklockonne commence that series of old settlements, which extend along the main path to St. John's river. The traditions concerning these places are that they were peopled by small colonies of Spaniards, but when, is lost in the lapse of ages; yet the numerous Spanish names which still exist, though corrupt ed, seem to corroborate the assertion. The period of this coloniza tion must have been some time in the seventeenth century : Romans states that there was in his time a church bell lying in the old fields near the Santafe, or as it is now called the Santaffy river. Two principal paths lead through Jackson county ; one running parallel with the sea coasf from the White Kings town on the Suwa nee to fort St. Marks, often impassable by inundations ; thence tra versing Forbes's purchase, crossing the Appalachicola at the Span ish bluffs, and after traversing the Ekansinna over the natural bridge, proceeds to the head of Santa Rosa bay. The other road leaves the Suawanee many miles higher up, and passing through Mikasukie and by fort Scott on the frontiers of Georgia, crosses Chattahootchie and Flint rivers above their junction. Here the road branches, one pass ing the Chamiooly over a natural bridge, and joining the southern road near the head of St. Andrew's bay ; the other continues near-"], [67, "63 THE FLORIDAS. ly parallel to the Alabama line to the Coosada old town. In commu nicating between Pensacola and St. Augustine neither of these roads are used, as the fords and ferries are scarcely ever practicable, and there are no accommodations, and scarcely inhabitants. The jour ney is performed by a circuitous route through Georgia and Alaba ma ; noris this great inconvenience likely to be soon remedied, as the travelling will be long too limited to induce persons to establish regular places of rest along so solitary a route ; and even should the Indians not be concentrated here as has been proposed, several years must elapse before United States' sales can be effected, and population come in ; and except Forbes's purchase, it is believed that no concessions have been made in this section. The Suwanee river divides Jackson and Duval counties, and as well as some of its chief tributary waters take rise in Georgia. The Outhlacuchy has long ramifications and comes from the N. W. The Alapapaha to which name the title Suwanee gives place above its junction with the Little Suwanee, has two equal branches which come from the north, after watering a large extent of land in Geor gia. The little Suwanee or little St. John's river heads in the cele brated Oke-fin-o-cau swamp, and is almost the only drain that large tract of low land has The recent surveys of the new counties of Georgia have demonstrated the size of the Oke-fin-o-cau to be very much less than was originally supposed : some of the earlier maps have represented it as occupying half the distance to the Flint and Chattahootchie rivers. Too little is known of the general interior of Jackson county to give such minute topographical detail as is desirable, and unable to speak decidedly on many points, the author has judged it more advi sable to be silent, than to swell his pages with mere speculative ob servations on an unexplored territory. Duval county lies north of a line, drawn from the Cowsord upon St. John's river to the mouth of Suwanee, and is naturally subdivi"], [68, "64 OBSERVATIONS L'PON\" ded into two districts of different sizes : which Brandy creek falling into the St. Mary's, seems to separate the western subdivision : be tween the Georgia boundary and the head branches of the north arm of the Santafly river, are pine lands which are mostly low : on the left bank of the Suwanee, and on New river, as well as the little St. John's, fertile lands are to be met with : but the general appear. ance is unprepossessing, although in the centre a ridge of more ele vated country spreads along, dividing the waters that flow into the opposite seas. But around the Santaffy and all its streams, an undu lating pleasing landscape and rich productive lands commence, giving indications of a material change being about to be observed, and we enter a region which will be more minutely described presently. We pause an instant here to mention the singular circumstance! of the SantafTy river, some considerable distance from its junction with the Suwanee, sinking into the earth and rising again at a distance of three miles : this space is called the Natural bridge, and here an Indian path crosses : it is stated that in times of high freshets, the space above the subterraneous channel is inundated, and that on those . j occasions a parallel current funs over it : Weechatomoka creek, *** 'a branch of the Santaffy. has a similar singularity, sinking precisely in the same manner for half a mile. A few miles below the White Kings old town on the Suwanee, upon the left bank, is the spring mentioned by the younger Bartramin his travels, wherein the mana- tee or sea-cow is often seen and sometimes caught. The eastern or maritime district of Duval county contains Nassau river and its numerous prongs, and little St. Mary's river : the lands upon all these waters are in general very fine and peculiarly well adapted for the cultivation of sea-island cotton. A large body of population are concentrated here, which was the northern district of East Florida alluded to in a former part of these observations. Deep marshes fringe the lower part of St. Mary's and Nassau rivers, and the connecting inland navigation. A large road, formerly"], [69, "65 THE FLORIDASi kept in excellent repair leads from the Cowford on St. John's river> to Coleraine and camp Pinckney on the St. Mary's : it is part of what was once called the King's road, and is the only direct outlet by land from St. Augustine. After passing the head swamps of Nas sau river, a path leads down to Waterman's bluff, on Belle river, nearly opposite the town of St. Mary's : near Coleraine another path diverges southwardly leading to the Alachua country, and an old trail exists from the Cowford ferry, crossing the high hills that di vide the waters of Black creek from those of St. Mary's river, and leading round the head branches of the Santaffy to Suwanee river. It is along the King's road that the mail should come to St. Augus tine : Jefferson in Georgia being made the distributing post office, instead of St. Mary's ; whence at present it is sent by water as far as Pablo creek at the mouth of the St. John's river ; much time, dis tance and inconvenience would be saved by this arrangement, and a semi- weekly instead of a weekly post, be established to the capital of East Florida. Probably Duval county will receive the first impressions of an in flux of population, which must speedily be spread over the country : it presents many attractions, and its vicinity to Georgia may induce the inhabitants of that state, who are already very favorably impres sed with Florida, to make it their abode. Not many grants are in the western district, though probably the maritime portion is nearly all covered with larger or smaller concessions. Saint John's county includes the remainder of the peninsula of East Florida, south of the line drawn from the Cowford ferry, on St. John's river, to the mouth of the Suwanee. It is from this division of the new territory, that greater expectations are formed on account of its extending into tropical regions : in order to treat of it more sys-. tematically, it will be adviseable to distribute the country into cer tain subdivisions : making all to the eastward of St. John's river the subject of one, and all to the westward of another ; the twenty-eighth 9"], [70, "66 OBSERVATIONS UPON degree of latitude being the southern line of these two : and again below that parallel, considering the chain of low lands as a divisioa between the Atlantic and Mexican districts of the rest of Florida. The first of these subdivisions is the extent upon which almost all the previous effortsof its European possessors were lavished, to bring it forward in civilization and agricultural improvement : within this narrow neck of land, with the exception of the maritime part of Duval county, all the white population of East Florida has been concentrated, and in the Spanish regime absolutely confined, for few if any ventured to cross the river St. John above Black creek deterred by the hostile attitude of the Indians. The general characteristic of this portion of Florida is flat, an. unprepossessing : but there are upon it many fertile tracts whicl will, when the hand of industry is judicially applied yield profitable returns. It is remarkable that this part of the new country, whicl had once made large advances in the path of civilization, should har. so retrograted and have become in many parts as great a wilderneii as in its primitive state : the withering influence of the old system of Spanish government perhaps occasioned this, by hitherto caslia; its blight around, and for forty years impeding the natural advantage of the country from being improved, by those willing and capableo the task. In all the accounts which have appeared respecting the peninsoli of East Florida, it has been a customary and primary remark thai the river St. John was the most prominent feature ; the observation must be reiterated ; that majestic flow of water occupying so remark able a place on the map, the appearance of the channel of its course being so varied, and the magnificent growth of timber clothing its banks, gives it at once te the eye of a traveller the importance assign ed to it by all writers. Hitherto its source has been considered i undetermined; but the late exploring and surveying expedition oi captain Le Conte of the United States' Topographical Engineers has"], [71, "67 THE FEORIDAS. set that question at rest : indeed the elder Bartram fifty years since, pursued the same route and arrived at the identical head lake, which terminated captain Le Conte's expedition. Tracing it back from its mouth, we find that lying in latitude 30\u00b0 18' N. with twelve feet water on the bar at ordinary tides : the dis tance between the nearest points of land is about one mile ; the first remarkable place after passing the mouth of Pablo creek is Kingsley's bluff, six or seven miles from the entrance on the right bank ; it is about twenty-five feet high, with a table land of some extent, pre senting an eligible scite for a town, which it is the intention of the proprietor to layout. The ship-yard on the same bluff, is well adapted for the purposes which its name indicates. The Cowford or pass St. Nicholas, twenty eight miles from the bar, is distinguished by its narrowness, being scarcely one thousand yards across, contrasting with the other reaches of the stream which are very wide. The high road laid out by the British and kept up by them and still called the King's road, crosses here. The line of the river which thus far has been perpendicular to the trend of the sea coast, here suddenly forms a right angle beco mingparallel thereto, and for the next thirty or forty miles dilates into succession of lakes or deep bays, never less than three and some times exceeding six miles in breadth. At one of the widest parts, a few miles above the Cowford, is the mouth of Black creek, naviga ble fifteen miles for large vessels to the forks. A few miles above the mouth of Black creek stands the old block house of Picolati : no thing remains of it except two of the shattered walls, through which loop holes and meutrieres are pierced : it stands on a low bluff and half concealed by the luxuriant branches of surrounding trees, it reminds the visitor who views it from the river, of the deserted cas tellated residence of some antient feudal lord. On the opposite or west side of the St. John's was sort Poppa, of which scarce a ves tage remains."], [72, "68 OBSERVATIONS UPON At the old Buena Vista station the river begins to wind in reach es, its general direction being still parallel to the ocean. The Ala chua ferry is only one mile across. The stream after passing the Devil's Elbow widens again, and receives by several mouths the wa ters of Dunn's lake : passing Buffalo bluff, a beautiful and fertile spot, its character is slightly varied by a chain of swamp islands, of which Bartram makes mention and accurately describes in the third chapter of his travels : At the mouth of the Ocklawaha, the river ex pands into a little lake and continues in that character to lake George whose entrance is covered by Drayton's island. After crossing this beautiful piece of water, which is about eighteen miles in length and eight or nine in breadth, the St. John's may be rightly designated as a river. The western banks of lake George are almost wholly pine : two beautiful streams called the Salt and Silver springs empty on this side : behind the pine ridges, extensive tracts of scrub land occupy almost the whole neck between lane George and the Ocklawaha river, extending southwardly in long prongs for many miles. The eastern banks have several orange groves, but the hammocks are not deep ; indeed the isthmus between lake George and Dunn's lake is chiefly pine lands. A bar at the southward of lake George, prevents the passage of vessels drawing more than five feet water, up the river : a few miles beyond is the Volusia settlement, on the east side of the St. John's, a flourishing and well settled plantation, where the sugar cane has this last year been raised with the most flattering prospects, having ri pened nearly six feet by the middle of November. Hope hill esta blishment, a little higher up, is also a good tract of land, and settling with much enterprise. Spring-garden branch comes through a tract of rich land, and aug ments the volume of the St. John's, which here begins to wind and pursue a tortuous course, driving almost in a S. E. direction : Alex-"], [73, "69 THE FLORIDAS. ander's creek comes in near a small lake, on the banks of which if an old settlement called Beresford's cowpen : beyond this the stream grows narrow, and at length heads in a lake of about ten miles in perimeter, beyond which there is no visible progress. The latitude of this place is about 28\u00b0 40' N. according to captain Le Conte's observations. From Alexander's creek upwards the St. John's meanders through extensive fresh marshes, dotted with islets of orange and live oak growth. At the head lake the water is several feet deep, and flows through the thick saw grass, flags and rushes, with some considera ble current ; and as far as the eye can reach the marsh or savanna appears to be interminable : its extent cannot be accurately defined, but from the circumstance of the impracticability of even Indians tra velling in certain directions, -it would appear that it has several branches, one of which undoubtedly connects with the head of the N. W. branch of Indian river ; another continues parallel to the coast, and is the same which has been found only three miles back from Indian river at the parallel of cape Canaveral : a third prong joins the marshes from whence the Ocklawaha river takes its rise, while the main branch loses itself in the deep cypress swamps and lagoons that extend to the Ever-Glade morass, an arm leading most undoubtedly to the source of the Haffia or Manatee river, which originates also in a similar marsh, and flows into Spirito Santo bay. The lands immediately on the borders of Dunn's lake are not of the first quality, but Haw creek and its numerous ramifications which are the chief supply of the lake, come through extensive Savannas, which promise to be future sugar fields, and appear ca pable of being brought into cultivation when properly drained. The number of settlements that once adorned the banks of St. John's river have disappeared, in consequence of the Indian wars and other causes before alluded to ; and in sailing up that majestic"], [74, "70 OBSERVATIONS UPON stream an air of stillness impresses the beholder with the idea that he is navigating the waters of an uninhabited and new country. The suture prospects we may consider as more flattering ; for in estimating the value of our new territory, we have accounted up on what it will be when fully settled, rather than what it now is. Above lake George the lands though in general low, may be con sidered as capable of producing various lucrative articles, for the rise of the river is not of that sudden or great nature as to inundate and destroy ; and it may by trifling embankments be easily alto gether prevented from flowing on the soil. The lands on the margin of St. John's river below lake' George, are hammock and swamp of all qualities, seldom more than half a mile wide ; behind this all are pine lands, both between the river and the hammocks and swamps, that run parallel to and at a small distance from the Atlantic ocean. The Twelve-mile swamp, and a few veins of good land on the large tributary creeks on each side of the river are exceptions. The Diego plains, the hammocks and swamps of Pablo creek, North river and Guana creek, are very good lands and convenient to market. To the southward of St. Augustine, rich fertile ham mocks and swamps are found on the margin of Matanzas, Halifax, Mosquito, and Indian rivers or lagoons, and upon the creeks that empty into them. Great quantities of live oak of the largest size were once to be found, but the timber fit for the first rate vessels of war is already scarce, and so far back from navigable waters as to render its trans portation nearly impracticable. It is no longer to be found to any considerable extent on the St. John's river or its tributary creeks. Some small portions yet remain on the banks of the North river, and on Diego plains, but it is feared that until a canal is made that the wood is scarcely accessible at the latter place. On Dunn's lake there is but very little ; the present supply is obtained only from the"], [75, "71 THE FLORIDA S. hammocks on Pablo creek and Halifax river. At the head of Indian river and its branches, there is some live oak timber, but it is too remote. Cedar is very scarce and but little to be sound, except upon one or two creeks on the west side of St. John's river. Much false expectation has been raised respecting the quantity of live oak and cedar in Florida, and these observations are thrown out, more with a view of guarding the unexperienced from indulging in this supposition, than pretending to state with precision the real extent of resources in this respect. There are many roads or paths through this eastern subdivision of St. John's county, but only two or three practicable for wheel carriages. The King's road from the Cowford to St. Augustine, and thence southwardly to the Tomoca settlements at the head of Halifax river, is now reopened by the exertions of the inhabitants residing in the neighbourhood ; and the road to the mouth of Pablo creek is at present the mail route, and generally used by visitors to St. Augustine. A carriage road also leads from the town to a land ing upon the Six- mile creek, whose mouth is at Picolati, and from which landing a short canal might be made to the head of navigation on St. Sebastian's river, which flows into the harbour of St. Augus tine. Were this done, which is perfectly practicable, the waters of the St. John's being thus connected with an established port, much produce would be transported to St. Augustine, whose bar at least equals that of St. John's, and a dangerous boat navigation through lake Valdez and the bay of Black creek, as well as the other wide parts of the river, would be avoided. Roads diverge from St. Augustine to various points of the St. John's, particularly Kingsley's bluff, Julington creek, Picolati, Buena Vista old and new, Rollestown, Dunn's lake, Buffalo bluff, Volusia( Spring Garden and Beressord's ; and to the settlements at Matan zas, and on the creeks discharging there : these however at present are only bridle paths ; obscure trails lead from the Tomoca and"], [76, "72 OBSERVATIONS UPON Volusia settlements over the head of the N. W. branch of India river, and thence in a southwardly course parallel to that stream. A road also goes along the sea beach from opposite to St. Augus tine to the mouth of St. John's. The Twelve-mile swamp near St. Augustine is equal to any body of land in the southern states for fertility : it appears to have been first cultivated in 1770, but since the occupancy of Florida by the Spaniards scarcely any agricultural operation there was attended lo. Graham's swamp, between Matanzas inlet and Tomoca, is also a rich soil, and the fresh marshes adjacent thereto are very eligible for sugar, &c. Colonel Bulow of South Carolina and some other enter prising planters are forming settlements in and near this place, which will doubtless give a tone to the undertakings in the country. The chain of good lands extends parallel to Halifax river and Mo squito south lagoon down to the head of Indian river. At Ross' old settlement on Mosquito lagoon sugar was formerly raised in large quantities : as also at the town of New-Smyrna ; to which a body of redemptioners from the islands of the Mediterranean were almost kid napped ; and forced to labour until the impositions exercised upon them, compelled the unhappy bondsmen to rise on their oppressors, and they settled in St. Augustine ; where their descendants forma numerous, industrious and virtuous body of people, distinct alike from the indolent character of the Spaniard and the rapacious habits of some of the strangers who have visited that city since the ex change of flags. In their duties as small farmers, hunters, fisher men, and other laborious but useful occupations, they contribute more to the real stability of society than any other class of people : generally temperate in their mode of life, and strict in their moral in tegrity, they do not yield the palm to the denizens of the land of steady habits : crime is almost unknown among them ; speaking their native tongue, they move about distinguished by a primitive simplicity and honesty, as remarkable as their speech."], [77, "73 THE FLORIDAS. OfRollestown, once an equally important settlement, not a vestige is left except a few pits which once were the foundations of large buildings, and a long avenue yet distinctly to be traced through the forests, the commencement of a grand highway to St. Augustine : the object of the sounder was singular, in one respect, which con templated the practicability of reforming the morals of a certain class of unhappy females, by transplanting them from the purlieus of Drury-lane to the solitudes of Florida. The planters upon Tomoca river and its vicinity are almost whol ly English settlers from the Bahamas, who quitting those sterile rocks, came hither to avail themselves of a better soil : all of them have prospered, and several have become very rich by raising sea island cotton, which for some years previous to this period well re paid their labours. As the river St. John inclines considerably to the Atlantic shore, the country to the westward of it is much wider than the eastern subdivision which has been treated of, and is perhaps under all cir cumstances the most interesting part of Florida. The Ocklawaha river, which is the principal branch of the St. John's, the Amasura discharging into the Gulfof Mexico, most of the streams that empty into Spirito Santo bay, Black creek a large tributary of St. John's river,\"all water this district, as also the eastern branches of the Santaffy. The dividing ridge of the waters of the Atlantic ocean and the gulf of Mexico, is very irregular in its elevation ; at some places it scarcely rises into small undulations, in others it swells to considera ble hills: it may perhaps more correctly be designated as a plateau of land ; one spur leading from the old Suwanee town, on the river of that name, runs parallel to the coast close on the west of the great Alachua savanna, where it meets another arm coming from the north-east, running between the sources of Sanfilasky and Tslachlio saw creeks, and stretching towards the St. John's ; these united 10"], [78, "74 OBSERVATIONS UPON proceed in a south-east course, and divide the Ocklawaha and Ami sura rivers, and expanding very considerably have a series of In dian villages planted on them, until as they approach the vast Sa vannas in the south they gradually sink down to their level : branch es of this ridge lie on both sides of the Amisura river, and on the north west of Spirito Santo bay. A very hilly region is also found on the neck which separatesthe St. John's from the Ocklawaha, and bordering close on the latter river. The extent, from the waters of the Santaffy in the direction of the ridge, and extending on each side, including the Alachua territory, down to the head of Spirito Santo bay ; and on the forks of the Ami sura, and other rivers, is a beautiful undulating fertile country, containing large bodies of hammock and oak and hickory land, with pine lands of a rich soil based on limestone : over this portion of the country as in many parts of West Florida nature has scattered a number of wells, holes and ponds of all sizes and various depths, many of them sufficient with the protecting shade of the surround ing trees or bushes, to resist the exhausting evaporations produced by the fervid glow of the summer sun ; becoming reservoirs of wa ter, cool in the warmest day. Some of these have their banks of such a slope as to allow cattle to descend to the water : others are of so perpendicular a descent as to require the use of a rope and bucket, and all are distinguished by a tuft of hammock trees grow ing around even the smallest, giving a pleasing variety to the mono tony of the pine woods. Handsome streams of water are sound in almost all the hammocks, which on the plateau generally discharge into some pond or lake: many of these rivulets afford for two thirds of the year sufficient water to drive mills. Besides the smaller ponds, a larger kind are often met with, some of which are even romantic in their appearance, particularly lake Ware, a beautiful sheet of water three miles wide and about five i\u00bb"], [79, "THE FLORIDAS. 75 length. In this lake is a beautiful island abounding with groves of the bitter-sweet or Seville orange : this was the fivourite retreat of one of the antient chiefs of the aboriginal inhabitants. Lake Pithlachucco and Orange lake are in many parts deep ; most of these large waters are in tempestuous weather agitated like a sea. The great Savannas are also remarkable : after periods of heavy falls of rain, they are inundated to the depth of several feet ; but when the warm seasons have evaporated this deluge, they often be come so entirely dry that the sire runs over them, and sweeps down the tall grass which has sprung up over them to a great height. The great Alachua savanna is the most considerable, being but seldom entirely free from water. Many curious stories are circula ted among the Indians respecting a whirlpool, where a subterraneous discharge of water is said to take place ; but the author has not been able to ascertain the fact. A communication exists by a narrow cypress swamp, from the Alachua savanna to the head of Orange lake : this latter terminates at its eastern extremity in a thick swamp, through which its waters gradually oozing, form at length a creek, rapid and deep, but narrow and very circuitous, and abound ing with logs and sand bars : this water course proceeding in a north-east direction, joins the Ocklawaha river. Ockawilla and Chicuchaty Savannas are very considerable, particularly the latter. In speaking of the hammocks it should be observed, that they in general surround the large lakes and Savannas, though also found scattered over the whole face of the country like islets : within them however a pond or lake is generally found, and often their size is regulated by the extent of this watery nucleus. On the exterior of the hammocks the black oak and hickory land is disposed and gradually spreads to the pine ridges, on which the hick ory is often found. The pine lands however are not all of the same elevated character : many of them being flat and covered with gall berry and huckle berry bushes : and sometimes interspersed with"], [80, "76 OBSERVATIONS UPON cypress ponds and bay galls: these however arc always in the vicin ity of the sources of the streams, and are but rarely found on the plateau; but nevertheless like all the pine ranges, they afford excellent pasturage for cattle, andifsown with the artificial grasses would pro cure abundant crops. It may be here remarked of the pine lands in general of Florida, that they are fertile ; a character strictly applicable, although they seem to the superficial view unfit for agriculture, particularly to the eye of a northern farmer who from early association of ideas, consid ers pine lands and barrenness as terms synonymous. Luxuriant pasture ranges are found every where, and millions of horned cattle may be raised with no other trouble than herding and periodically burning the grass, which quickly grows again, the tender shoots im parting by their succulency and fragrance, a flavour to the flesh not always sound in the stall-fed beeves of a city. The chiefsup port of the antient Indian population was derived from their countless herds of cattle, which a succession of invasions from hostile tribes and lawless borderers have now almost wholly exterminated. The Amanina river is a beautifnl stream, and flows through a tract equal to any in these parts ; and but for the impediment of the shal lows at its mouth, would afford a great outlet for produce ; as it is, small craft will convey the exports to the great emporium of Spirit* Santo bay. The Ocklawaha river takes its rise in lake Eustis, which like the bead lagoon of St. John's river, is formed by the accumulation of waters from the great southern marshes. Its course is parallel to the St. John's, and it occasionally expands into lakes as flowing through the alluvial soil on its banks. As its course diverges to the east to fall into the St. Johns, the vast volumes of water brought with rapidity down its narrow channel overflow the low lands, and a la byrinth of islands intervene, from where the Orange lake creek joins it, to its junction with the principal stream some miles below"], [81, "77 THE FLORIDAS. lake George. These islands are covered with a luxuriant growth of tall swamp trees, but so entirely inundated as to make their re demption for cultivation a Herculean task : but which once ef fectually accomplished, would make them mines of wealth, unequal led perhaps by the best Missisippi sugar fields. The high lands between the St. John's and Ocklawaha rivers, south of the path from the Voluniato the Indian crossing places, are of the same character with those of the plateau on the western side of the lat ter stream. North of the above path, large veins of scrubs extend to lake George and chiefly fill up the neck. These scrubs and undu lating grounds, consist of a sand of a very small and ferruginous grain, producing an infinite variety of dwarf oaks and a number of parasitical plants ; where the land swells to a considerable elevation, there is generally to be seen a growth of small spruce pines, most of which however seem to die, after springing up to the height of twenty or thirty feet. The wythes and other creeping shrubs which interweave with the humble species of oaks, renders a passage very difficult, and the paths which are so directed as to cross the scrubs in the narrowest part, wind so to take advantage of the intervals be tween the patches of bushes. Water is very scarce here, and only found in a few sinks or ponds similar to those in the pine lands, but without trees around them. Another kind of land, are the ridges of white sand covered with the small black or post oak, commonly call ed black jacks. These are sometimes so thick as to exclude the pines, and when this is the case there is#scarcely any grass found on the sand hills. On the southwestern part of the Alachua territory, and extend ing between the Amasura river and the Mexican gulf is a remarka ble tract of country, which presents a curious appearance : the whole of the pine lands, which are remarkably handsome from their undulating surfaces, were burnt some thirty years since ; instead of the clear open woods generally seen, masses of young"], [82, "78 OBSERVATIONS UPON pine saplings are thickly spread over the rocky ground, whicfc is strewn with half burnt light wood logs, that have not been destroy. ed by the action of the air for so many years, while numerous stiU more hardy pieces of timber remain erect though dead, firm as ada- mant pillars. Here and there a solitary green pine remains that escaped the ravages of the original fire, which succeeded by almost annual ones, have kept the woods in a state of continual undergrowth, It is supposed that a space of nearly three hundred square miles have been thus devastated, and nothing can be more desolate that the situation of a traveller who bewildered in this labyrinth, roanu without end over mossy rocks and shaking morasses, impeded al every step by the black shapeless logs ; at every eminence he sees the same scene repeated, and no end appears to this very remarka ble desert. Here and in many other neighboring parts of the extensire plateau, rocks are found upon the surface, of every size ; sometimes loose, or disposed in curious ridges that to a fanciful imagination, give the idea of the irregular rootings of mammoth swine: thew rocks and stones consist ofa sileceous nucleus, enveloped in success ive lamina of different formations of lime-stone : there are even occa sionally met with something resembling mill or burr-stones, well adapted for sharpening tools and grinding corn. Clay too is found here and in many other parts of these western pine lands. The general soil may be described as consisisting ofa light but rich loamy sand. It may be mentioned here, being omitted inadvertently in ib proper place, that a similar scene of devastation exists on the main path from the old Suwanee to the Mikasukie towns, though produced by a different cause. Many years since, a tornado passed over the lands there and prostrated for leagues every tree : so sudden and so universal was the effect of the ruin, that immense numbers of the deer and other wild animals were crushed to death, besides herdi"], [83, "79 THE FLORICAS. of cattle : the Indians and Indian negroes state that the bones of the beasts thus suddenly destroyed are to be seen scattered in every direction, and it has been asserted, that it is only within latter years :hat the trees have rotted away sufficiently, to allow horses to travel along the paths which are thus incumbered. It is within the subdivision of St. John's county now under descrip ion, that a large number of the grants and patents issued since 1812 are ordered to be located : the great Alachua grant to Arredondo ind Sons of the Havana, and several other extensive patents are iaere : and a part of the purchase of Hackley under the Duke of Ala ron is included in this ; more particular notice of which and the _ther, will be taken in another part of the work. The paths through this portion of Florida are numerous : the main routes from the Suwanee meet in the centre of the Alachua at he town of Micanopy, on the northern bank of Taskawilla lake ; from hence which was the antient capital of the Indian nation, the :racts diverge in all directions to Black creek, Picolati, Vibrilia md Buffalo bluff on the central parts of St. John's river : routes also ro down to Tampa bay through the chain of Indian villages and set lements, and to the lower crossing places over the Ocklawaha by svay of lake Ware, and hence a path leads to Volusia on the St. Fohn's above lake George. It is by this latter course that the mail is said to have been ordered to travel from Pensacola ; but why it should be sent nearly one hundred miles from the straight direction it Is difficult to determine : after crossing the Suwanee rirer it ought to pass through Micanopy, and thence either to Vibrilia and new Buena yista on the St. John's, where there is a good ferry established, and >n to St. Augestine : or from Micanopy to Picolati lower down the \u25a0iver. The former route would at present be better, as the stages -vould be more regularly divided ; though in either case, three days _asy journey, without travelling by night, would bring the mail from he Suwanee to St. Augustine."], [84, "80 OBSERVATIONS UPON Several roads from the eastward and northward meet at Chnucha ty. and thence go down to the falls on the Ilaffia. In the northern part, paths proceed from Black creek, Picolati, and the Cowford, di- rect to the upper part of the Suwanee. It is across this part of Florida that at some no distant time a com munication will be established for travellers to New-Orleans. Steam boats coming direct from the large northern cities, will enterthe St. John's and proceed up to some eligible landing, and the passen gers taking stages to the banks of the Suwanee near its mouth, will again embark in these ambulating hotels, and proceed along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico to New-Orleans : by this route a voyage from New-York to the former city may be easily completed in ten dav< Connecting the waters of Black creek and Santaffy rivers by a navigable canal of thirty or forty miles a route may be opened, that will afford many facilities for bringing the produce that comes dona to Appalachie bay, to the Atlantic markets, and ofconveying the re turns : independent of the fruits of the plantations for many miles around the canal. The junction of the Ocklawaha and Amisura rivers would require a shorter cut, but from the high lands is impracticable in such a country : the former river however is navigable almost to its very source, and will serve as a channel of exportation of all the agricul tural productions that do not find their outlet by Spirito Santo bay, or the St. John's. This portion of Florida which the author has endeavoured to de lineate, contains nearly all the most valuable lands in the territory, and may be accounted healthy in almost every spot : the general elevation of the land and the openness of the woods, allows afree circulation of the air, set in motion by the winds from either side of the peninsula, and uncontaminated by the exhalations from intermin able swamps, and endless bodies of low land."], [85, "81 THE FLORIDAS. We now proceed to examine the remaining two subdivisions, into which the county of St. John has been distributed in relation to our subject, being all the lands lying below the parallel of the twenty eighth degree of latitude, considering as before mentioned, the chain of low lands as a division between the Atlantic and Mexican districts, commencing near the head of St. John's river and terminating at the louth of Shark river or cape Sable creek. The western part of this descriptive subdivision is exclusively oc cupied by the remainder of the purchase of Hackley from the Duke of Alagon alluded to a few pages back : included within these limits are the three spacious and celebrated harbors of Tampa, Charlotte and Chatham bays, besides a variety of rivers the mouths of which af ford inlets for small coasting vessels. Tampa or more properly Spi rito Santo bay has been described in a former part of these topogra phical observations : it may be remarked in addition here that there are two other inlets besides the principle one, each aflording from twelve to eighteen feet at low water. The coast generally between Spirito Santo bay and Charlotte harbor is composed of flat islands in front of high forests of pine, behind which there is reason to believe the country is chequered with the small masses of hammock disposed over an undulating region of fertile pine lands as are found upon the plateau in the north and western parts of this country : the authsr however has not been able with all diligent research to find any ex isting record ol a description of this tract : and consequently no de tail is laid down of it, and but few watercourses appear on the map, but when minute information can be procured, it will undoubtedly be found well supplied in that respect. The banks of Asternal and 2h_rlotte rivers as well as those of the Coolasahatc'iie and Delaware ire well wooded with excellent timber. All along this coast down to cape Romano or Punta Larga, the tide ibbs and flows only once in twenty four hours with a rise of but .hree feet : this is increased or diminished according to the preva- 11"], [86, "82 OBSERVATIONS UPON lence of the winds in the gulf of Mexico : in dry seasons the tide ri ses high in the fresh water rivers being perceptible at some distance from the sea. In Chatham bay the tide ebbs and flows what is called tide and half tide : that is three hours flood and three hours ebb: then nine hours flood and nine hours ebb : the current of the tide is very rapid, and the rise is seven feet as far as the point of cape Ro mano, beyond which its influence is not felt. From the head of Chatham bay to cape Sable creek, numbers of small islands and keys line the coast and several small streams empty. Pavilion keys and Lostman's keys are the principal, and like the rest as well as the generality of the land on the main, consist of drowned mangrove swamps. On the margin of some of the small waters, are hills of a rich soil which rise among these dreary mangroves, and from the tra ces of antient cultivation yet visible on many of them, were probably the last retreats of the Coloosa nation of Indians which has long been extinct, having been gradually driven from the country by other tribes. The pine lands behind these swamps are computed to be at a distance of ten miles from the coast across the mangroves, and beyond the narrow ridge they occupy, comes the great Ever-glade morass. Scarcely any paths through this subdivision are known except the one leading from the falls of the Haffia or Manatee : these falls are merely rapids over a bed of secondary limestone rocks, determining the head of navigation of that river. This path inclines in a south east direction, and traverses the great chain of low lands and the prongs of the glades at the narrow parts, known only to a few of the most wandering of the Indians ; after many days travelling in water, du ring which they carry with them prepared provisions and stakes to raise them above the level of the inundation while resting, they find their way to the Atlantic coast somewhere about Jupiter inlet. The vast bodies of low lands that lie south of this trail and fill tip"], [87, "83 THE FLORIDAS. the interior of the southern extremity of the Florida peninsula,appears to have scattered over it many tracts of firm land in the form of islands and promontories, and though at present a communication across appears impracticable, and the accounts from Indians, negroes and refugee whites, place it in the worst possible point of view, yet it is by no means improbable there is a passage from island to island, over the several branches of the morass which are not always of a breadth to deter the attempt : nay the author is more inclined to believe, that from the general exaggeration human nature is prone to, it may be bet ter than supposed, and that if the discouraging accounts do not deter a sectional survey, it is by no mean? problematical but the expense would be amply repaid by the discovery of many rich pieces of land in detached spots : how far admitting them to be found, settlers would be induced to purchase on supposed unhealthy situations need scarce ly be discussed : where the profits are proportionate every risk has been and will continue to be hazarded, by the spirit of enterprise which in this country is so predominant ; which leads the hunter to seek his valuable skins in the frozen mountain of the north west, and sends the agriculturist and merchant to the remotest and most unheal- thy places. The Atlantic subdivision of the southern part of St. John's coun ty has almost wholly been described while treating on the general outline of the Florida coast, for nothing is known of the interior ex cept what has been stated in that place ; the rivers along the whole length from north to south, appearing to head in the Ever-glade mo rals or branches connected with it. Some difference exists between St. Lucie as it was found by the author, and the description given by Romans, who states that he went up the N. W. branch that appearing the principal, for twenty-four miles reckoning direct distance ; that there the river became narrow and partly on account of the obstruc tion of the logs, partly on account of the rapidity of the stream, he left the vessel and going up by land found the river at last to run"], [88, "84 OBSERVATIONS UPON through a vast plain, the bank of the stream being fringed with a few trees. When this account is compared with what was observed by the writer and stated in a former part of this work, he is tempted to con sider with Sir Walter Raleigh, that if the same place and circum stances is viewed by different persons under such contrary aspects, that he had better burn his book and avoid the risk of being consid ered the narrator of untruths. That however there is some great reservoir of water is certain, from the profusion of fresh water which the river St. Lucie pours down : such is the immense quantity that the whole sound is often made fresh through its vast extent and deep indentations. The rapid current of the gulf stream sweeping close along this part of the Florida coast has the effect of closing the bars of the inlets, particularly Jupiter, through which so immense a volume of water seeks to discharge itself, that nothing but the continued throwing up of the loose sea shells prevents the streams from forcing it open: they even sometimes prevail : Jupiter inlet after a heavy freshet in the spring of 1769 was opened and so remained for three or four years. On Indian river inlet the freshets sometimes make ten feet water and at other periods there are not three : the general quanti ty found is five feet. The bar of Rio Seco is similarly closed to Ju piter, and also a small inlet called Indian creek near cape Florida. Cayo Largo though ranked among the Florida keys is no more than a promontory from the main land about half distance between cape9 Florida and Sable, and connected by a very narrow isthmus : the whole however is rather a cluster of mangroves than solid land, ex cept where the gulf washes up a sandy beach on the exterior. Sound point or Cayo Largo was formeily called cape Florida, but that name is now applied to the eastern part of key Biscayne. The topographical observations on the continental part of Florida, as far as correct information has been procured, being thus conclu ded we should proceed to the subject of the keys and banks, known"], [89, "THE FLORIDAS. 85 under the designation of the general Florida reef, but as their capa bilities are confined to maritime concerns, and an interesting account of the wrecking system and other similar points are closely interwo ven with them, we shall defer entering on this branch of our subject for the present."], [90, "86 OBSERVATIONS ON THE SOIL AND ITS NATURAL GhOWTH. The general character of the Florida lands is light : sands of dif ferent granulations, and sandy loams based upon limestone or clay at a variety of depth, are what chiefly are sound; and from this lightness they are perhaps not capable of bearing a succession of exhausting crops ; but nevertheless the land when thrown into old fields soon renovates itself, from a fertilizing principle which per vades the air, and subsides to the earth : this principle is undoubted ly generated by the saline particles, which are carried from each sea on to the lands. The different qualities of land in the Floridas, may be divided de cidedly into, and known under the following names : Flat pine lands Pine land Savannas Hammock savannas River swamps Undulating pine lands Low hammock High hammock Cypress swamps Fresh marshes Oak and hickory lands Scrub lands Salt marshes"], [91, "87 OBSERVATIONS UPON THE FLORIDAS. The flat pine lands are of themselves of two kinds: the one sort covered with a thick and luxuriant growth of berry bushes, dwarf bays and laurels, with grass only in patches, and the pine trees sparsely scattered over the ground : the other kind has little or no undergrowth: being thickly covered with savannas and cypress ponds and galls, it is often overflown from them and on the least fall of rain becomes drowned ; the herbage however is generally plentiful. It is with these two sorts of low piny land, that a great portion of this space between the sea and St. John's river is covered, mixed in how ever often with the other descriptions of soil, but giving on the first view an unfavorable idea to the new comer ; a great number of branches and runs of water take their rise among these low grounds ; and wherever these low pine lands are found they may be consid ered as the head of some river or creek. The elevated and undulating pine lands are healthy and beautiful ; the timber is taller, straighter and of a better quality than on the low grounds : their appearance in the western part of the country has been already described, and wherever they are met with partake more or less of that nature : they abound with succu lent herbage : the Saw palmetto bushes are very rarely sound in these high pine lands, they being confined to a middling description of ground not so low as to be liable to frequent inundations, nor high enough to foster a different species of undergrowth. The low hammocks are the richest kind of lands in Florida, and capable of producing for many successive years rich crops of sugar, corn, hemp, or other equally exhausting productions : they are however clothed with so heavy a growth of timber and under wood, that the task of clearing them is appalling, and they require ditching and banking to guard them from extraordinary floods and rains. Graham's swamp, between Matanzas and Tomoco, is chiefly low hammock. The upper parts of both sides of Indian river and"], [92, "88 OBSERVATIONS UPON its north- west branch are of this quality of soil, as alsot he margins of the river St. John from Volusia to Beresford's old cowpen, though narrow and perhaps somewhat too low. Many fine tracts of low hammock are scattered over the western parts of the peninsula, about the heads of the Santaffy and other rivers, and on the ' anks of Alligator creek and many of the smaller tributary streams ; also in the upper part of the region between the Suwanee and Appala chicola rivers. Here and elsewhere, West Florida proper is scarcely mentioned; for confined between the Perdido and the Appalachicola rivers, it is so comparatively small and but tittle known, that it has not been taken into consideration. It is true that to magnify its importances \"monstrous cantle'\" has been carved out of East Florida ; but in the subsequent pages of this book, it should be understood that East Florida comprehends all to the East of the Appalachicola river, in cluding in fact seven eighths of the whole territory. The growth of timber usual on these low hammocks is principally the cabbage tree, (of which it may be observed in passing, that none are found west of the Ocklockonne river) ash, mulberry, dogwood, Spanish oak, live oak, white oak, swamp hickory, sweet bay, sassa fras, cedar, magnolia, wild fig, wild orange, zantoxyhim or prickley ash, and a vast number of other kinds, with varieties of all : in the more southern latitudes the torch tree is found, also the gum guia cum, mastic, wild tamarind, red stopper, pigeon plum, cocoa plum, sea grape, tiswobd, &c. &c. A thick vegetable mould of from one to two feet ir. depth, covers the surface of the ground in these low hammocks, below which black coarse sand is found, gradually be coming paler as the depth increases, until the clay or limestone is struck. The high hammocks are if possible more dense in their growth than the others, but the coat of vegetable matter is thin, and the white sand lies within a foot or eighteen inches of the surface :"], [93, "89 THE FLORIDAS. they are said to be notwithstanding very productive for years, with out any manure, which indeed is never thought of being applied. In addition to most of the trees\" sound in the low hammocks, we meet laurel, red oak, chestnut oak, chinquopine, beech, persimmon, cinnruion-laureI, bastard-ash, myrtle, locust, and a numerous list of other trees : great varieties of the cane and reed are in both des criptions of hammocks : countless parasitical plants interweave and fold round the trees ; the wild vine shoots up to a most surprising height, and the stalk is commonly found seven and eight inches in diameter. The oak and hickory lands produce almost exclusively those two kinds of forest trees, with occasionally gigantic pines : the under brush is generally composed of sucker saplings of the oak and hickory ; this description of land is generally disposed on the ex terior edges of the high hammocks, and separate them from the pine lands. The black oak is the species most general here ; the soil a rich deep yellow sandy loam. The scrub lands have been particularly described before*in page 68 : they vary but very little in their general appearance wherever sound, and are of too forbidding an aspect to lead the farmer to ex pect from them any advantage, except perhaps that of raising hogs, for which they are peculiarly well adapted, from the abundance of acorns on the dwarf oaks, and a number of curious roots to the sandy plants. The pine land savannas have a very black and rich appearance, but notwithstanding they contain only white sands, though the clay beneath is perhaps nearer the surface ; they are merely sinks or drains to the higher grounds, their low situation preventing the growth of pines. Most of the roads in the vicinity of St. Augustine are unfortunately obliged to traverse very extensive regions of (his sort, and consequently in wet seasons they are scarcely passable, and greatly disgust the transient visitor. 12"], [94, "90 OBSERVATIONS UPON The hammock savannas have a more fertile soil ; fossil broken shells, are embedded in the mould which is rich and black, and of some depth : the clay is often within a foot of the surface of the earth. The great Alachua savanna, the savannas on the borders of Haw creek and its prongs, and the large savannas west of and paral lel to Indian river, are of this description : deep ditching and high banking will be however requisite, to guard them from the inunda tions their low position naturally exposes them to. Pasturage of the most luxuriant kind is afforded by these savannas, which are valuable features in the territory. - The word swamp is, in the signification now adopted, peculiar to America ; by it is understood a tract of land lying low, but with a sound bottom, covered in rainy seasons and high waters with that element. Almost all forest trees, pines excepted, thrive best in the swamps, where the soil is rich, and when capable of being clear ed and drained they are proper for the growth of rice, sugar, corn, bemp, indigo, &c. &.C. The.r-uer swamps are annually overflown, and require judicious and indefatigable attention to their embankments when in a state of cultivation. The growth common in these swamps are the swamp oak, willow oak, swamp maple, tupelo, elder, willow, swamp mag nolia, black birch, sumac, cypress, black and white poplar, Florida holly, sycamore, hawthorn, Sic. &c. Sometimes the land immedi ately on the river banks is rather higher than the grounds a little behind, which are then called back swamps ; these are nearly con stantly full of water, and have chiefly tupelo growth, and no under wood. Cypress swamps are mostly near the heads of rivers, and in a con tinued state of inundation ; little or no underbrush, but only crowds of the cypress shoots or knees, which point up like small pyramids. In the river St. John many of the swamps and islands are of this kind, as also in the lower parts of the Ocklawaha ; they are like wise bordering on the great southern morasses in every direction."], [95, "91 THE FLORIDAS. While we are on the subject of wooded low lands it may be ob served, that in the pine lands, the early courses of the creeks and streams are through two sorts of channels, bay galls and cypress galls. The bay galls are spongy, boggy, and treacherous to the foot, with a coat of matted vegetable fibres : the loblolly bays spread their roots, and the saw palmetto crawls on the ground, making them al together unpleasant and even dangerous to cross : the water in these bay galls is strongly impregnated with pyroligneousacid. The cypress galls have firm sandy bottoms, and are only troublesome from the multitude of the sprouting knees. Clay is often sound in both these kinds of galls, which are sometimes very narrow and sometimes dilate into large morasses. The fresh water marshes are of two kinds, hard and soft ; the hard marsh is made up of a kind of marly clay whose soil has too much solidity for the water to disunite its particles : and therefore, being also generally higher above the water, may be with little trouble adapted to proper cultivation : the soft marshes lie lower and are more subject to overflow and require in the embankments, earth from the highland to make them substantial, and consequently are more expensive in their redemption ; but this once accomplished they are undoubtedly the most fruitful ; affording in the dry culture means of raising sugar, hemp, corn, cotton and indigo. The salt marshes are likewise of two kinds, hard and soft, from the same causes that effect the fresh marsh : the hard salt marshes however are often altogether clay, and like those in Indian river are covered with purslain : these when fully embanked and redeemed, and freshened by the cultivation of cotton or hemp for a year or two, would undoubtedly become the finest sugar fields : that hard kind of salt marsh upon which fresh water occasionally flows and known com monly as rush land, is extremely eligible when properly prepared for agricultural purposes. The soft salt marshes are totally useless except as manure : in the"], [96, "92 OBSERVATIONS L PON part os the peninsula south of Musquito, the mangrove takes the place of the marsh grass and reeds, and by its interlacing roots give a greater consistence to the soil : when the main stem ofa mangrove bush or tree gains a little height it sends down to the water a new shoot or root, and each horizontal branch as it puts forth, do^s the sam.-, by which the parent trunk is surrounded, like the East In dian Banyan tree : these downward shoots as they approach the wa ter branch into several points, which again subdivide almost ad infini turn, until the family of roots are twice as numerous as the upper branches, thickly set together, extending in all directions, and closely interwoven with the similar ramifications from the surrounding trees or bushes, often causing the growing up of the channel ofa narrow creek, whose waters in times of freshets and floods ooze through their roots as through a thousand miniature arches. It maybe observed generally of the soil of Florida, that there are four strata : the upper tract of vegetable mould or earth : below sand; beyond that marl or clay; and lowest of all indurations ofshell and lime stone rocks. This arrangement is however by no means constant; there are frequent bluffs on the St. John's, particularly at Volusia, which are high and covered deep with a rich loamy black sand thickly overspread and mingled with broken fossil, and periwinkle shells in every state of perfection, and below this is only sand : other varie ties from the general rule are continually found. However this may partially be, it seems certain, that the two harder substrata re tain the moisture from oozing through the sands, and thus become another cause of fertility. It has been a matter of some question whether the orange is an in digene of Florida, but after a due consideration of the question it would appear it is not ; for although now found in almost every swamp and hammock, yet it is only where the wandering Indians may have scattered the seeds : in those places where they have not been at all seasons of the year, though far south, the orange is seldom if"], [97, "THF, FLORIDAS. 93 ever found ; where man has not penetrated with the fruit in his hand it is unknown. The kind of orange most common in the Florida woods is the sour and bitter-sweet : of these latter some are almost as free from acid as a China orange, and retain only enough of the aromatic bitter, to make them in the taste of many superior to the sweet orange itself. A most delicious wine is made in England of the Seville orange, which appears to be the same that is called the bitter-sweet : the numerous groves of this fruit in Florida will one day when the sugar is plentiful, induce the farmer to adopt orange wine as a pleasant, healthful and economical domestic beverage. The wild grapes of Florida when duly trained and cultivated, will afford another simple fermented drink : let us hope that the dreadful practice of drinking ardent spirits may be checked in our new terri tory, and that the more sober juice of the grape and orange may su persede the use of those intoxicating draughts, which in many parts of our union threaten almost to brutalize the human being and degrade him beyond redemption. The myrtle wax shrub is found in every part of the Floridas ; the berries are gathered in a vessel and bruised and then boiled : the wax is skimmed off and when cold is of a dull green : from this can dles are made : it may however be bleached by various simple chemical processes ; in many parts of Carolina and Georgia the planters use lights of this wax altogether. The gall nuts which in our druggist shops bear a high price, are commonly found on the dwarf oaks among the scrublands in every part of the country. Hops are said by Romans to be indigenous in Florida, but the au thor did not meet with any. In Sweden formerly a strong cloth was made from the stalks of hops, which required however a much lon ger time to be steeped in water than flax. The starry aniseed or somo, or skimmi of Japan and China has been found indigenous in Florida : and many other plants of that"], [98, "OBSERVATIONS UPON THE FLORIDAS. 94 country are also natives here : whence we may infer that others, productive in commerce, may be profitably introduced. Almost all the natural vegetable productions of Florida may be advantageously turned to account by the industrious, and time will develope the mode in which it is to be done : at present we can only point out those more immediately prominent, and proceed to another division of our subject, having in this one merely aimed at giving a stranger a more distinct idea of the soil and growth of our territory and enabling him to judge for himself. Again however it is deemed incumbent to warn those who are unacquainted with the subject, from condemning the vast tracts of pine lands in Florida to neglect, for in the end they will be found to yield perhaps the most satisfactory returns : it may be said \" do not visit Florida with high raised expectations of fertility or you will be disappointed\" : butit must be added, \" and on the contrary, do not suppose every pine tract a barren, or that sterility is a consequent attendant on our light soils and sandy regions.\""], [99, "95 OBSERVATIONS UPON THE SEVERAL APPRO- PRIATE ARTICLES OF CULTURE. The great expectations which have been raised respecting Flori da, have included within their range a hope of introducing many if not all of the richest of the West India productions, particularly coffee, and it even lead to the projected formation of a company in Philadelphia for that purpose, who fitted out an expedition in July 1821 to explore the country and select eligible spots for the future cultivation of the coffee plant : the results of this expedition have never been published, but reports of a nature most favorable to the scheme were afloat twelve months since : they have however gradu ally died away, and if the project has not been abandoned, it waits at least a more auspicious moment for completion, congress having refused to grant a peremptive right of purchase to a company, of lands stated to be eligible for the purposes intended. From the preceding pages the reader has not perhaps been im pressed with such sanguine expectations respecting the coffee plant, and the author without pretending to negative the assertion of the practicability of raising this berry, does not think it can be recom-"], [100, "96 OBSERVATIONS VPOS mended as a safe speculation, for reasons stated in other places. Sea Island cotton, Cuba tobacco, sugar and a numerous list of fruits, marketable both in a green and preserved state, surely are produc tions in themselves sufficiently lucrative to draw the attention of the planter, and to these will he confined what follows on the subject of cultures appropriate to Florida. Respecting cotton, it has been so profitable to every Florida plan ter who has raised and prepared it for market, as done in the south ern states, that it may only be slightly mentioned. The resident gentlemen on Amelia, Talbot and fort George islands, at Pablo, at Matanzas and at Tomoco have cultivated it for many years, and their brands have ever commanded the first prices in the markets of Sa vannah and Charleston, particularly those of our respected dele gate Joseph M. Hernandez, Esq. from his plantation Mala Compra at Matanzas ; of which, by the bye, it may be remarked, that the soil (high hammock) is now as white and as sandy as the beach of the Atlantic, and yet most luxuriant crops are annually produced. Here and at other plantations exists a practice of cutting down the old cotton stalks and suffering the shoots therefrom to spring up, which yield with but little trouble a cotton no ways inferior to the first crop : this is called ratoon cotton. Many of the fields at Tomoco are equally white and equally fertile with those of Mala Compra, and this singular appearance is sound in very many other parts of Florida, where the original growth has been almost exclusively live oak. Respecting sugar, the recent successful trials that have been made upon it, have determined the curious fact that it will grow in almost any of the soils of Florida, south of th mouth of St. John's river : the great length of summer, or period of absolute elevation of the thermometer above the freezing point, allows the cane to ripen much higher than in Louisiana : it is perhaps the fact that the ex hausting vegetation of this article may not allow a profitable planting"], [101, "THE FLORIDA-!. 97 of it upon the same lands more than two or three years in succes sion, yet as it may be raised on the pine lands, a change of fields is easy, and attended with but little comparative trouble ; and by suffer ing the lands to lie fallow, or by a judicious succession of crops, it will not require a very extensive tract to establish a sugar plantation. Perhaps it may be thought that Florida presents but little to tempt the large sugar planter: granted, but it is undoubted that if the culture of the cane should be adopted on a small scale, by the same proportionate number of cultivators that are in the habit of raising cotton in Carolina, Georgia and Alabama, their labour would be amply repaid, and a source of wealth be opened, particularly should some public spirited and enterprising individuals establish, on cen tral and eligible points sugar mills to receive the small crops, pre cisely on the same principle that cotton gins and rice mills exist in the southern states. This would augment the population and in crease the resources of the country sooner, and better perhaps, than any other mode. A race of independent respectable farmers would create society and happiness among themselves, and prove the back-bone of the new territory. The fruit culture of every kind will in time become general, but although highly eligible and certainly lucrative, it will require the success of a few capitalists to give the tone to the general opinion on this head. The necessity of waiting four or five years before re turns upon the principal can be made, will deter many from attend- ing to this important branch. It is upon the poorest spots of land, unfit for almost any thing else, that many of the numerous subsequent list of fruits may be brought into cultivation : this mode is one that requires little hard labour and exposure to noontide suns ; it can and will be adopted by a large number of the poorer class of persons, who now inhabit the middle country in Georgia and North and South Carolina : these industrious people, who are obliged to toil incessantly to raise a 13"], [102, "98 OBSERVATIONS UPON few stalks of cotton, the produce of which barely supplies half their winter clothing, will find in the warmer latitudes of Florida a plea sant employment, that will more than triple their returns in their present state of living. Another concomitant advantage attendant on the raising and cul tivation of fruit will be the circumstance of being able to do it with out slaves. If this be properly fostered, we shall only find negroes wanted by the planter of sugar, cotton and tobacco, while a genera tion of industrious whites will grow up whose simple manners and virtuous habits will resemble the vine cutters and olive dressers of France and Spain ; but free as the air, their unshackled independ ence will render them doubly happier than those almost still feudal peasants ; and as a body they will prevent the possibility of those commotions which have lately threatened more than one slavehold ing state. It is a well known fact that in West Florida the French govern ment ordered a suppression of the vineyards, lest their success might injure those in France ; and we learn that similar restrictions as to the olive, and perhaps the grape, were imposed by the Spaniards over the Florida colonies. Although these decrees are antient, and have perhaps long become dead letters, yet they must have prevent ed the spirit of enterprise, that in the first instance suggested such establishments, which once quenched, was not easily revived. The native grape of Florida is so very luxuriant, and circum stances shewing the practicability of planting vineyards with suc cess, let us hope an effort may be made to introduce with judgment some of the most approved foreign grapes, which may be tried by graft, by sucker, or by seed. The Corinthian grape, (vitis apyrend) or the grocers' currants of the stores, is an article of great consumption, and flourishing in the Levant, must infallibly succeed in Florida. The great demand for dried raisins, both in boxes and jars, can"], [103, "99 THE FLORIDAS. surely be supplied from our own territory. We will not in the first instance pretend to rival the wines of the Rhine, the Rhone, the Loire or the Garonne ; to supersede the produce of Oporto, Xeres, Sicily or Madeira, but at least we can, after furnishing the deserts for the table of the opulent, provide a pleasant beverage for those who do not choose the products of such expensive vintages, and who will not be dissatisfied to exchange French brandy, New-England rum, or apple whiskey, for the less exciting but more palatable wines of their own country : North Carolina has proved that from their native grapes a delicious wine may be prepared, and can we doubt our success in a still more genial climate ? \u25a0 The following list of productions capable of being raised in Florida, has been made out with some pains, and it is believed all these stated are profitable and practicable articles. China orange The olive Madarin orange The Vine in all its varieties Maltese orange Corinthian grape, or St. Michael orange Zante currants Myrtle orange Pine apple Lemon Fig Lime Plantain Citron Banana Shaddock Yam Mangoe Bread fruit Pawpaw Arrow root Cocoa Gal1 nuts Date Dolichos, or Soy bean Sweet almond JalaP Bitter almond True rhubarb Tamarind GinSer Pistaccio Gum gleni Acagua Gum g\"'\u00abcum"], [104, "100 OBSERVATIONS UPON Aloe Fustic Cinnamon Braziletto Pimento Sassafras Sago palm Balsam tree Red pepper Senna Saponeka Sarsaparilla Jesuits bark Hemp Benne oil Turkey madder Palma cbristi oil True opium poppy Tea Camphire tree Sugar Balm of Gilead tree Cuba tobacco Tumerick Rice Frankincense Cotton Cloves, Pepper Silk Nutmegs Cork oak Leechee plant of China Chesnut tree Liquid amber These and a number of other articles particularly the gums, may be produced in most parts of the peninsula ; and upon looking over the list it cannot be denied that if but a little were introduced how much should we gain and how advantageous would bej_ur prospects. Having spoken already of the vine and cotton, let us in turn consider each staple article of importance. The Cuba tobacco has already been raised in the neighborhood of St. Augustine from seeds supplied from the Havana : the second year it however degenerates : this appears no obstacle since the seed can be procured with the greatest facility, it being very small and light : and in the lower latitudes the plant may be cultivated without such frequent renewal. If we can produce in Florida by these means a tobacco equal to the best from Cuba, it will be a great desideratum. To perfect the fragrance of the leaf, the vanilla which is found indigenous all over the country lends its ready aid, and"], [105, "101 THE FLORIDAS. should segar smoking still continue in fashion, the Florida weed may in time be thought equally good with the best Cabanas. It is to the olive that the patriot, the merchant and the agriculturist will look for permanent and substantial advantages to result to Flori da ; the olive, favorite of Minerva, fertilized the plains of Attica, and saw young Freedom thrive beneath its shade : from the earliest time to the present eventful era, the olive has brought plenty to the regions where it was fostered, and when even liberty had passed away, re mained to support and comfort the unhappy enslaved beings, whose ancestors had planted it in happier times. It is not necessary here to describe the olive tree and its fruit, the process by which the pulp yields its oil, or the mode of preserving the drupe : the inquisitive reader is referred to Michaux's North American Sylva, where under the head Olive, he will find an elegant description from the classical pen of Augustus Hillhouse, an enlight ened citizen of the United States, whose residence in the country of its cultivation and his literary researches, have enabled him to de scribe all its usefulness : a few slight abstracts are made from his pamphlet, published in Paris, that are considered interesting. There are more than thirty varieties of the European olive tree, distinguished by their temperament as to soil and climate and the qualities of the fruit Some of their varieties, like those of the vine, owe their characteristic properties to the scene in which they are reared : Among the principal are, The weeping olive, endurant of cold rather than of drought ; its branches are pendent like those of the weeping willow : its fruit and oil are pure and good. The round olive is also hardy, requiring a moist good soil ; its oil is ofa superior quality. The small round olive requires dry and elevated grounds. The picholine olive yields the most celebrated pickled olives : this rariety is not delicate in the choice of soil and climate."], [106, "102 OBSERVATIONS UPON The olives should for Florida, be raised from the seed sown in the spring : in a year they will have attained to a height of two or three feet : in the third spring with proper attention they will be four or five feet in height and half an inch in diameter, with a tap root of thirty inches : they should then be transplanted and placed three feet apart ; and at the end of five years may be permanently placed in the olive grove, at a distance of about forty feet : the young olives begin to yield fruit the tenth year and are fully productive about the twen ty or twenty-fifth. The olive arrived to an advanced age may be transplanted in the same manner as the young tree. This mode of raising the olive may be censured and rejected : the length of time which must elapse before they begin to reward the labor of the planter seem to forbid the adoption, more particularly by an American, who however he may persevere in an object once undertaken, would probably droop, did he foresee that he must not expect to reap the fruit of his own labours : an American particu larly in a new country labors for himself and not for his son, whom he expects when arrived at maturity will equally labor : this prin ciple is to be lamented, and may prevent the planting of other fruits as well as the olive ; but as respects the latter, could this objection to obtaining plants from the seed be overcome, it is doubtless the most eligible practice, as the plants thus reared begin a new life, they are more vigorous, of longer duration, and better adapted to a new climate than offsets from an old tree : they form also a perpen dicular root which penetrates deeply and secures them from the dan ger of suffering by drought. With the nicest economy in the process the weight of the expres sed oil is equal to about one third of the ripe fruit : the mean pro duce of a tree in Florida may be assumed at thirty pounds weight of oil : though in fruitful years in Italy three hundred weight have been known to be obtained from a single tree. The constant breezes which traverse the Florida peninsula would"], [107, "THE FLORIDAS. 103 refresh the languid olive tree through the sultry summer, while in these southern latitudes they would be secure in the winter. Let us then hope that the olive may ere long be as much the emblem of Florida, as it has been of her mother country, from whose trammels she is at length freed. While the olive trees are young and yet unbearing, the attention of the farmer will be directed to the Benne plant from which and from the poppy a fine table oil is procured nearly equalling that from the olive; it grows in almost any kind of soil ; the peculiar advantages of the benne and its history and productions, have been set forth at length in the publications upon Florida, which are already before the com munity and it is not necessary here to repeat them. Oranges, lemons and limes are already in full bearing in many pla ces, and their extensive introduction will one day supersede any im ports from abroad : the plantain;and banana will also in time prove lucrative to those who raise them. Preserves from the citron, shad dock, mango, pawpaw, tamarind, &c. may and ere long will be made in Florida equal to the most delicate kinds from the Antilles. The pine apple and the bread fruit will in the lower latitudes form elegant articles of culture, to be shipped to the northern cities, where they are always in request. The fig is a native of the country, and the dried fruit is a profita ble article of commerce. The spices, gums, dye woods, and medicinal articles, may form the minor objects in the nursery, and fill up the time not employed in attending to those things which are cultivated in larger quantities. The palma christi or castor oil is planted by many gentlemen in Georgia and South Carolina, who obtain from nine to twelve dollars per dozen bottles for the expressed oil ; the luxuriance with which this plant vegetates in Florida will cause it not to be neglected : it is an article of the materia medica, in much request, and perhaps but too little planted."], [108, "104 OBSERVATIONS UPON The dolichos or soy bean is said to produce in China, four craps annually : from this kidney bean is prepared the soy or Indian cat sup. In the south of Spain and many parts of the Mediterranean this bean, or a variety of it, forms a large portion of the food of the lower class of people : it is there called caravances : as an article of subsistence for negro slaves this is nutritious, and apparently raised in the greatest abundance with facility. Rice of course can readily be grown in the usual low situations ; but it is probable that all the lands fit for this grain, will be found to be more profitably devoted to the sugar cane. A most important branch has yet to be treated of ; the breeding of the silk worm, which in this country is so easy : it would afford an employment to the children of the poor white settler who other wise might be idle, useless, and contractive of indolentand bad habits : by introducing into every family the fashion of attending to these val uable insects, as much as to the poultry yard, the quantity of raw silk would be great enough, to form in no long time one of the staple com modities of Florida : this combined with the fruit cultures would complete the circle of small, quiet, domestic occupation, which is so desirable to form in every family that comes to reside in the ter ritory. A remark on the best mode of rearing the mulberry trees on which the silk worms altogether subsist, may not be here improper ly introdeced. The white mulberry is the best, and it should be sown by seed so as U> spring up in the form of wide hedges often feet in breadth, lea ving a lane between each : in this mode the leaves may very readi ly be gathered by a pair of sheers, or even by hand if it is thought proper to form the hedge of less width. The hand of taste will na turally place these hedges, so as to combine with the exterior fence of the garden; and take away the monotony of the uniform wooden palings, which usually enclose the flower plots or vegetable beds of our southern plantation gardens. Respecting the treatment of the"], [109, "THE FLORIDAS. 105 worms and the methods used to reel off the silk, any Encyclopedia will explain them. Hemp will flourish in this country : how far the introduction of it is eligible, is unknown, but it is thought that it might be profitable. There are a number of varieties of the palmetto, from whence the inhabitants and even the Indians form ropes : much' of the small tack ling of the fishing boats is made of this grass, which is rather the bet ter for being kept wet, as it is apt to crack like rushes when dry : we also find in the country that palmetto, from whence the rigging, cordage and cables of most of the West India small craft are made. The cork oak (quercus suber) being of quick growth might advan tageously be planted, and would cause another foreign production to be dispensed with. The Spanish chesnut not only yields a harvest of remarkable dry fruit, but by the elegance of its foliage and the depth of its shade would form a beautiful ornament to the grounds of a plantation. Indian corn, buckwheat and guinea corn are among the most im portant bread stuffs, and constitute natural objects of cultivation : the latter grain is preferred by the West India negroes to the Indian corn, and is thought to be even more nutritive : it is also perhaps better adapted to the warm soil of Florida, producing most abundant returns : this as well as millet is peculiarly fit for fattening poultry. The sweet potatoe in its fine varieties need scarcely be mentioned, that and every esculent grows almost spontaneously and with a ra pidity scarcely credible. The dog grass of South Carolina or annual meadow grass has been recommended as the best adapted to be sown in Florida, where it succeeds in the very meanest soil. The clover and other foreign grasses probably require favorable spots,though the author has seen occasionally a few clover blades in the western pine lands, which in dicate at least that they would live in soil nst the richest. The scud or scots grass might also be tried. 14"], [110, "106 OBSERVATIONS UPON Rye and oats succeed well and grow with great rapidity : as food for working horses the latter is certainly preferable even to the soft gold seed corn. We have not yet made mention of the tea plant : that the latitude of Florida is sufficiently genial for its production there can be no doubt ; but whether the soil would answer, or if so whether it can be grown as cheap as the present importations from China, are ques tions that have not been considered. By obtaining the seeds in Canton and sowing them in tubs, young sprouts may with- care and attention be safely brought over : the experiment is certainly worth trying, although many may sneer at the suggestion : but this was also the case when cotton was first tried, and will always attend what are considered innovations : it is to be hoped that there are in the union, men of enterprise who will not be easily discouraged from es saying : the profit if successful' would amply repay : the trouble and disappointment would be small, and the expense not to be men tioned. Remarks on the raising of stock do not come precisely under this head of the work, but as most other objects of the attention of the agriculturist have been treated of we may include all points relative to a nursery, farm or plantation. Certainly one of the most eligible employs in Florida will be that of breeding large herds of cattle : the rains and dews create a luxuriant vegetation all the year, requiring only a regular and successive burn ing of the grass, to allow the young shoots to sprout : in other pla ces mention has been made of the excellencies of the country for this object, and we can only repeat here the great advantages of this plan. Already the hides and tallow from South America are scarce, and it has been demonstrated by writers on political economy that the demand for leather in the world is greater than the annual sup ply and expedients are of course made : in the south the skin of the alligator is formed into water proof covering for the feet, and for sad-"], [111, "THE FLORIDAS. 107 die seats, and experiments are making to find other succedaneums. The cattle require no winter fodder ; the few wild animals will soon be extirpated and a single herdsman may attend to large droves. Sheep may also be bred in numerous flocks : when the success of our manufactories have driven foreign broadcloths and woollen stuffs from the market, the demand for the fleeces will be great : the climate of Florida will tend to improve the texture of the wool and supplies of a superior quality will be sent to the northern marts. The Angola goats may be brought into the country where they would find a temperature congenial to the one they inhabit, and the mohair would add another article to the long list of Florida produc tions. The critical reader must not imagine that the discussion, of what are considered appropriate objects of agricultural attention, are merely Utopian : the country is capable of producing all, if the en ergies and skill of man are combined to attend to them : and can we doubtit? Can we suppose that so many sources of wealth will re main unvisited, unexplored and rejected ? Certainly we must answer, No. The adoption of all will not come at once : each successful ex periment will induce the trial of something new, until the resources of the country are fully developed, the territory thickly peopled and the tide of agricultnre and commerce at the full. It is doubtful whether a happier man will be found than a respecta- ble independent planter, who fixed in a salubrious spot in Florida, finds on his farm every luxury that is so dearly purchased by the cit izens ofa crowded city : his sugar, tea, fruit, preserves, animal and vegetable food will be the produce of his own fields or farm yard : the livers supply the most delicious shell and scale fish : the wild fowl are excellent and numerous : his vineyard, olive and orange groves will offer their unstinted products ; his orchards and his garden supply all to tempt and gratify the appetite : except for a few articles of wear-"], [112, "108 OBSERVATIONS UPON THE FLORIDAS. ing apparel, which if necessary could be supplied at home, he will be wholly independent ol the world, while he will send out his cargoes of superfluous productions to supply the wants of his less fortunate fellow-citizens in more northern climes. Such will be at a future day the situation of the Florida planter who by a judicious ar- rangement of his capital and industry, shall turn the silent forests in- to smiling fields and flourishing plantations."], [113, "109 OBSERVATIONS ON THE TEMPERATURE AND CLIMATE. The climate of the whole of Florida during eight months of the year, from October to June, is delightful, and almost one continued spring ; as the range of the thermometer in the hot months of sum mer is only from 84\u00b0 to 88\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, and constantly cooled by the sea breeze, they are by no means so oppressive as in Caro lina or Georgia, and such intense sultry weather as marks the north ern dog-days, is seldom if ever felt. On the Atlantic side the winds from the south and south-west make a thick heavy atmosphere, and impeding the airs from the ocean, cause an oppression and heat that create the only unpleasant sensations experienced during the Florida summer. Generally speaking the springs and summers are dry, and the autumns changeable : the winters are mild and even serene ; snow is scarcely seen at St. Augustine twice in a century, but the black frost is au occasional visitant ; though at the severest times the ice has never been formed thicker than the sixteenth part of an inch ; its action has never extended south of cape Canaveral, and but very"], [114, "110 OBSERVATIONS UPON rarely reaches Mosquito inlet. The nipping of the white frost oc casionally is felt so far as the extreme capes of Florida, though not an annual visitant. The duration of the frost or cold of any kind never lasts but a few hours, and seldom occurs more than once or twice in January, which is the severest month. The cold winds are always from the north-west. In the peninsula of Florida rain is foretold one or two days be fore, either by an immoderate dew, or by the total absence of the dews on a calm night ; the winds from the north-east are cool and moist, and cause the frequent showers by which the sand of this climate is endued with a prodigious vegetative power : almost inva riably when the rain has ceased, the sky does not continue over cast, but the clouds pass away, the horizon clears up, the sun again makes his appearance, and the breeze which brought the shower blows free and unsurcharged with moisture. The rains and dews, without being troublesome, create at most seasons such a luxuriant vegetation, that the surface of the earth is never without good verdure. The long absence of the sun, the days and nights being nearly equal, gives the ground time to cool and re cover from the daily evaporations. Another pleasant consequence of this, is the very delightful fresh ness of the nights in the sultriest period of the year, by which the body is refreshed, the sleep sound, and the natural faculties restored to vigour. As a precaution, a sheet of clean writing paper or a silk handker chief placed in the hat keeps the head cool, when necessity requires an exposure to the summer sun : this is more needful, as light straw hats are generally worn. Saint Augustine has always been healthy until the summer of 1821, when it was visited by the yellow fever which proved fatal to many strangers : we shall endeavour presently to account for this pesti lence, and to show that its return is not to be dreaded, and that it"], [115, "111 THE FLORIDAS. is not an attendant either on this town or upon any part of Florida. No opportunity of information has been afforded respecting a similar scourge at Pensacola the last year, but that city having ever been free hitherto from such fatal fevers, similar causes to those in St. Augustine may have operated there. That not only St. Augustine, but such parts of East Florida as have been occupied are healthy, is to be clearly inferred from the fact of the ninth regiment of British infantry having been stationed during the revolutionary war in detachments at St. Augustine, Ma tanzas, Picolati, and St. Marks on Apalachie, and during a period of twenty months not losing a single man by natural death. That the climate is good for patients of a consumptive habit is notorious, several persons during the last winter and spring from Carolina and elsewhere having recovered their health ; and that the air is not at any season hurtful, is equally known from the circum stance of the native and foreign ladies walking till late in the moon light on summer and autumn evenings, with only the slight co verings on their heads of their lace veils or mantillas, and many even without these. Medical men have stated that dampness or dis colouring of plaister, soon moulding of bread, moistness of sponge, dissolution of loaf sugar, and rusting of metals, are marks of bad air : now all these are remarked in St. Augustine, and notwithstanding it is very healthy : this dampness is occasioned by the saline particles which arising from the sea, by no means occasion sicknesss. And for the salubrity of West Florida we have the authority of Romans, who tells of an old man of eighty-three, who had very du tifully gone five miles on foot to catch fish for his mother, who had taken a fancy to a dish of that food, and in the meantime was busied at home in preparing a batch of bread. The fashion of sending invalids from the north, on an expensive journey to the south of France and Italy, may perhaps be superseded, if the physicians could be induced to recommend a winter at St."], [116, "112 OBSERVATIONS UPON Augustine to their patients, who would thus, instead of being ti moved, perhaps to die in a foreign climate, be near their friends and within a few days' sail of their homes : admitting for one instant that the summer months are unhealthy, no one can doubt the salu brity of the rest of the year. The geniality of the climate, the beauty of the orange groves, the vicinity of the ocean, and the quie tude of the place, would contribute greatly towards the restoratioS of health to consumptive persons. Without entertaining any preju dice in favour of St. Augustine, the attention of the faculty is seri ously entreated by the author to this subject, and to the propriety of ordering their debilitated patients to try the salubrious air of Florida, which has in one remarkable instance restored along crip pled gentleman of New-York to the use of his limbs, a fact well known to all his acquaintance, who came in wonder to visit bin on his return in full activity to New-York. But although the sea coast, and the elevated lands in the interior are undoubtedly healthy, it is by no means certain that the banks of the large fresh water rivers are free from those miasma? which generate intermittent fevers, agues, and the disorder known at the southward as country fever : in the fall of the year, when that sea son is rainy, these complaints do occasionally appear, but they are confined to the immediate borders of the water courses, and do not extend to the high lands in the vicinity. Upon the salt waters, such as Matanzas, Halifax, and Indian rivers, no such disorders exist, and hence the planters at Tomoco, Mosquito, &c. are perfectly free from sickness. In proceeding to give a probable account of the rise of the yellow fever in St. Augustine, it must be prefaced by a sketch of the local situation of the town, in which brevity will be studied : the writer also begs leave to request that his theory must not be too fiercely assailed by gentlemen of the medical profession, who in the present era of discussion on so mysterious a subject, may differ as widely"], [117, "THE FLORIDAS. 113 each case was independent of the other : neither contagion nor in fection were in any one case perceptible ; the foul air that genera ted disease was confined to each dwelling. Some of the most deci ded cases arose, when late in October there was hired for the occu pation of the officers a house, that had been closed all the summer ; it was in a close part of the town, but no sickness was near: three or four of the officers fell almost immediate victims. It is true that many died from the effects of inordinate indulgen ces, great exposure to the hot sun and heavy rains, and a few cases could not be traced to satisfactory causes, but in general explana tions could be given. Three or four vessels also came from the Havana laden with fruit, which performed little or no quarantine ; one had on her voyage lost the captain and all the crew ; and one lay close along the wharf, aground at low water ; several cases were clearly traceable to these vessels : but each nucleus of infection does not appear to have expanded, nor was there any actual infected district. The author and many of his friends were continually call ed on to visit and even nurse the sick, without having any appre hension of incurring any danger. The humanity, the attention, and tke friendly unremitted good offices ofthe Spanish ladies, towards the sick strangers, will ever be remembered with admiration by those who saw their efforts, and with gratitude by those who experienced them. It is in woman's bosom that all the virtues take a deeper root, and flourish as in a more genial soil. The author has seen from these amiable females a tenderness bestowed on the dying man, that would not have been exceeded by the patient's own family, and the pillow of disease has been propped, and the bed of death smoothed by the most maternal and sisterly cares. From what has preceded it is inferred that with a proper venti- lation and a due attention to cleanliness and sobriety, St. Augustine will never again be visited by so sweeping a pestilence, and we may"], [118, "114 OBSERVATIONS t/PON THE FLORIDAS. argue in proof thereof its remarkable salubrity this past year, not a single fatal case of fever having occurred in the space of the last fourteen months. The very judicious arrangements which have been made lately, by the municipality of St. Augustine, will soon reproduce that per fect neatness and propriety, which formerly distinguished this town : its reputation for health established, we may hope that it will be a retreat in summer for the Carolinian and Georgian, and a shelter to the inhabitant of more northern states, from the rigor of their severe winters. A society will thus be gradually formed, that may tempt the invalid to renew his visit annually, and induce many to join the colony which trill be planted in the Montpelier of America."], [119, "THE FLORIDAS. 115 from the author as from each other : the conclusions attempted to be drawn from facts, appear natural ones, and are submitted for con sideration in the study, not put forth as dogmas to the public. The town of St. Augustine is situated on a neck of land, formed by the river Matanzas which is the harbour, on the east, and St. Sebastian's creek emptying thereinto, on the south and west ; on the north an entrenchment extends from the glacis of sort St. Mark, which is at the north end of the town upon the harbour, to the marshes of St. Sebastian's creek. This neck of land is divided into two peninsulas by a small stream called Mari-Sanchez creek, run ning parallel to the harbour, but heading in some low lands within the lines : it is on the eastern peninsula alone that the town is built, the western one being occupied by kitchen gardens, corn-fields, orange groves, and pasture grounds. Somewhat more than half way between the sort and the south end of the western peninsula, a stone causeway and wooden bridge crosses Mari-Sanchez creek, and connects the two portions of the precincts of the town, and it is to the north of this causeway that the principal part of the buildings are placed, forming a parallelo gram somewhat more than a quarter of a mile wide from east to west, and three quarters in length from north to south. The houses on the side of the harbour are chiefly of stone, hav ing only one story above the ground floor : these latter are invaria bly laid with a coat of tabbia, a mixture of sand and shells well known in our southern states, and are scarcely ever used but as store rooms, the families living in the upper story. The dwellings with few exceptions, on the back streets, parti cularly in the north-west quarter, have but the ground floor ; and are generally built of wood, though stone ones are common, but al most all are laid with a tabbia flooring. The undeviating salubrity of St. Augustine, while under the Bri tish flag, was certainly augmented by the perfect cleanliness aud 15"], [120, "116 OBSERVATIONS UPON neatness, which was the characteristic of the town during that epoch ; and that it continued so, while the buildings crumbled into ruins over the heads of the indolent Spaniards, and the dirt and nui sance augmented in every lot, is an additional proof of the natural healthiness of the place. St. Augustine owed a large portion of its inhabitants to the many dependants on the Spanish government who held numerous small posts, the salaries of which were perhaps not punctually paid, but the daily allowance of rations in kind, enabled the holders to exist in their various shattered habitations which they were unable to re pair, and in many instances only half occupied : and thus it was at the exchange of flags in July, 1821. At this period, and for sometime before and after, these families dependant on the government, and many others, emigrated to Cuba and left their houses and lots uncleaned and shut up ; the breaks in the dwellings however, open to the heavy rains which fell at that period, the waters of which of course stagnated where they fell. The casemates of the fort had also many of the rooms disused and shut up, from a variety of causes, not the least of which were the leaks in the tabbia pavement of the platform. The author lately heard it stated by a medical gentleman of high attainments, and now one of the first characters in Congress, who bad honoured him with his friendship and acquaintance ; that a ves sel whose hold was clean and empty, which should remain at anchor in any southern port during the hot summer months, would have the infectious miasm\u00e6, which generates what is called yellow fever, collected in her hold, to which all going into it were exposed. Thus were endangered crowds of adventurers, mostly in a state of poverty, who flocked to St. Augustine and were pent in numbers in the common boarding houses that were opened in jnany of the tenements which had so long been closed. The fever broke out in the back streets in isolated houses, and"], [121, "THE FLORIDAS. 117 Cayo Largo, Long key or Sound point key, is actually a peninsula. In 1769 captain Bernard Romans with great labor, fatigue, inconven ience from musquitos, and a total want of fresh water for four or five days, explored its inside waters. He was stimulated to this enter prise by the reports of the Providence and Spanish fishermen, who told him unanimously, that they had often tried to enter at Angel-fish creek and to come out at Boca Herrera, the creek oppposite to key Tavernier ; or the contrary way, but always in vain, nor did any of them know an instance of its having been done. Captain Romans then went in at Angel-fish creek, and after a great deal of time spent in Sandwich gulf, no passage was found : he afterwards entered into Grant's lake, by drawing the boat over dry ground for above six times her own length. Out of this lake he found his way, by a very nar row passage at the south end : but as no part of key Largo yields any fresh water, and after he got into Grant's lake all the ground round him being mangrove swamp, he was unable to find any : two of his people were nearly exhausted by thirst, which it was impossible to alleviate till he reached the watering place at Maiacombe. This is stated by way of caution if any stranger should get there : for though he will find abundance of fresh water on every other part of the coast, he ought not to venture to be for any purpose, within this peninsula of key Largo, without a store of that invaluable necessary. Key Largo formerly abounded with mastic, lignum vit\u00e6 and maho gany, but the most valuable has been long cut down, and there is none now but very young timber. A portion of good rich land is on this key, among the principal growth of which is found the wild cinna mon, wild olive, &c. : in most places where capable of cultivation, the soil is a rich black mould of considerable depth : the larger growth heavy, but the under brush not so thick as usual in the ordi nary hammocks. Key Largo has no living animals on it except ra coons and insects. The south end of key Largo is determined by a small creek scarce a musquet shot wide, admitting only boats and"], [122, "118 OBSERVATIONS UPON called by the Spaniards Boca Herrera. The bay within abounds with fish, turtle, and lobsters. Key Tavernier has little or no high ground, affording only sand crabs and some few doves and other birds. There is here a small harbor within a reef where the wreckers usually lie. Nearly east from this key lies the southern point of Carysfort reef making a wide channel called Palmeston in and outlet : this south point is dry, but in the channel is four and five fathoms, and ships in distress may find shelter under the point. From key Largo passing by Bull's island with a little key at its south end, the navigator proceeds to Young Matacombe, which is sour miles long with a well of good fresh water at the east end : abreast of this key is a clump of sunken rocks called the Hen and Chickens. Next to the south west is the island of Old Maticombe remarkable for being the most convenient and the best watering place on all this coast : on its east end are fine wells in the solid rock, said to have been cut by the Indians, but which appear to be natural chasms, similar to those sound on many parts of the peninsula of Florida : they yield excellent water in abundance as do likewise some ponds near them. This island was one of the last habitations of the In dians of the Coloosa nation. There are some good rich lands upon it capable of cultivation. About a mile towards its north east end lies a small bushy gravelly key, on the extremity ofa reef: it is called Malanza, that is slaughter, from the catastrophe of a French crew, said to have amounted to near three hundred men, who were unfor tunate enough to fall into the hands of the Coloosas, by whom they were to a man murdered on this spot. Matanza key is the leading mark for finding the watering place on Matacombe, in the channel to which is ten feet water. East from old Matacombe is the south point of Matanza reef and Spencer in and outlet : from which the Great reefbegins to be divided"], [123, "119 OBSERVATIONS UPON THE FLORIDA KEYS AND WRECKERS. The general Florida reef commences at cape Florida, on the eastern coast in about latitude 25\u00b0 38' N. and trends about southwest to bay Honda, twenty-five or thirty miles south of cape Sable, whence it sweeps nearly west until terminated by the Tortugas bank. The edge of soundings, which are chiefly one hundred fathoms, are nearly parallel to the outer edge of the reef; within which, be tween the banks and the keys is a channel, where about fifteen feet may be carried all through : the general rule for sailing within the reef is, to have a careful man at the mast head to look out ; from the transparency of the blue water he will see all the heads and shoals a good way off, in a clear day at least a mile, and thus making the eye the pilot, and keeping a middle channel, this dangerous navi gation is passed. Key Biscayne has been styled and is now called Cape Florida, though there is not actually any decided headland, and hence the un certainty of the latitude : at the south end are wells : the inlet at the north end called Bear Cut, admits craft of six feet water into the bay"], [124, "120 OBSERVATIONS UPON behind where are the settlements : and the channel at the south the same. Soldier's Key is six or seven miles to the southward, containing on ly a few roods of land. Elliott's key next below, is eight miles in length and about half a mile wide : there is a harbor here with eight feet water, and an inlet over the reef of two fathoms nearly opposite : there is also an anchorage often feet under the lee of the island. Upon this key is a small quantity of land fit for vegetation and light productions. Saunder's Cut, is to the north of Elliott's key and the inlet known as Black C\u00e6sar's creek'is to the south, dividing it from Jenning's island a small spot, with two keys at its south end forming an inlet known by the name of Angel-fish creek. Here commences the long irregu lar land called Key Largo, about the middle of which is the pro montory of Sound point. / Sound point, is the only spot that may be said to form a true pro montory, from the Rocky springs a little south of Jupiter inlet. This point has sometimes been named cape Florida, but the Spaniards hav ing designated the southern end of key Biscayne by that name, their appellation has prevailed. It is on Sound point, that is on the ex tensive reef before it, that almost every vessel that is cast away meets her fate. The north point of that reef (Carysfort) extends as far as Angel fish creek and its south point which is dry, marks a deep channel to go in towards Key Tavernier. The people who watch the misfortunes of navigators, to make a benefit of them (the wreckers) know so well how much ships are exposed in approaching this reef, that they station themselves a little south of the point, from whence they can with certainty wait for the sight of any ship, that is so unfor tunate as to be driven ashore : hence Key Tavernier has become for the last fifty years the general rendezvous of the little fleet of small craft, which are annually fitted out for wrecking, of which more notice will be taken presently."], [125, "121 THE FLORIDAS. into smaller spots ; the channel within them is likewise deeper and wider, but there is less smooth, water than from key Biscayne to key Tavernier. KeyVivora is the next key, beyond which is Cayos Vacas or Cow keys, on the largest and westernmost of which is tolerable water plenty of deer. The next islands are called Bay Honda keys, extending some leagues westwardly. Beyond these is Newfound Harbor, due south from which, and four miles off is key Looe, a little sandy bar or island which takes its name from the British ship of war Looe having.been lost there. To the east of key Looe is Dartmouth in and outlet, through which all vessels generally pass that go from St. Augustine to the Havana. A few miles further westward is the island called by the Spaniards Cayo Huesso (Bone key) and by the English key West ; since the cession of the Floridas to the United States it has received the name of Thompson's island. \u2014 It extends east and west for six or seven miles, having a shallow bank before it : at the north east end is a small anchorage ground called Spanish Harbor ; the principal harbor or roadstead is at the west end ; but it is considered unsafe in northern and western gales. There is about twenty-sour feet water, and the way in is to keep close on board the west side of the small key which lies some miles to the south-east of the west point of Thompsotj's island : draw close enough alongside this key to chuck a biscuit on shore : then steer about N. W. by N. to the point of the island. Key West is perhaps two miles across in the very widest place ; and is naturally divided into two parts differing materially from each other : the west end offers a considerable body of rich dark mould interspersed with loose limestones ; the timber growing on it is neither high nor large, but the underbrush is very thick : at this end fresh water is found in abundance and of good quality. The eastern half has very little good soil upon it : the salt ponds of which so mucb 16"], [126, "122 OBSERVATIONS UPON has been spoken, extend nearly all through it ; they are separated from each other and from the inlets and bays formed by the sea, by solid rocks and loose stones almost destitute of vegetation. The wa ter in them, as they now are in a state of nature, is about two feet deep pretty uniformly, and extremely salt : the ponds are generally allowed to be of the very best kind, and of an extent sufficient when properly attended, to supply the United States ; it is singular that no other of the Florida keys contatn such natural ponds, though pos sibly artificial ones might be constructed on them in favorable situa tions. Deer are extremely abundant, as well as a variety of birds : indeed almost all the adjacent keys are well supplied in this respect, if they yield fresh water. The tide ebbs and flows here regularly six feet, and the time of high water at the full and change is eight o'clock. The Havana bears from hence S. 6 degrees, W. twenty-five leagues, but vessels steer higher up on account of the currents. Key West was granted to Don Juan P. Salas, the private secretary to governor Coppinger of East Florida, but it is at present claimed by general John Geddes of Charleston, S. C. and by Mr. Symington-, both of whom have establishments upon the island, and are both in possession. The title of the former gentlemen has been pronounced by the attorney general of the United States as clear and indisputable : Mr. Symington has also obtained some first rate legal opinions deci dedly in his favor. At key West terminates what was formerly called by the British Hawke channel, but which is now known as the passage through the keys ; from this passage there are several channels into 'the Gulf ot Mexico : the first of these passages is to the west end of old Mata combe island, but will admit no vessel of above six feet draught of water : it is called Onslow passage, passing near Cayo Axi or Sandy key, off cape^Sable : the second passage is at the south west end of Vivora island with nine feet water : the third or Gordon's passage"], [127, "THE FLORIDAS. 123 has eight and a half feet water : the fourth has the name of North passage : it opens at the west end of the southernmost of the bay Hon da keys, and goes along the north east side of the largest of the Mar iyrs : its depth of water is seven feet, but it is narrow and difficult. None of these passages are now much in use, except by the fisher men and turtlers. The fifth passage called by the Spaniards Boca Chica, lies between My West and Mule keys: vessels from the southward in the stream should stand in through key West channel or in coming down through the keys ; after clearing the south point of key West, steer in, keeping close on board the shore within thirty or forty yards, then laying N. N. W. until all shoals are cleared : the lowest soundings are sour teen feet. To the westward of key West channel are two others, one between Mule key and Marquis bank, called Boca Grande : the other lies between that bank and the dry Tortugas shoals and is the westernmost and broadest of all. The Martyr keys lying back between bay Honda and key West may be divided into two classes : the high, and the low or drowned islands. The high islands are based upon grey, white or black hard rocks ; the low or mangrove islands are sounded on coral rocks, co vered with a rich but wet soil. The high islands are heaped in pla ces with sand on which little or nothing grows : in other parts they have a stratum of bluish marl, on which flourish in great abundance and in a most agreeable temperature, a large variety of tropical trees, shrubs and plants. None of the islands are inhabited. The quant ity offish, and loggerhead, hawsbill and green turtle found here is almost incredible, particularly about bay Honda : among the long catalogue of fishes is a remarkable species of prawn which in a for mer page has been improperly noticed as a lobster : it wants in fact the two claws : it is sound, sometimes weighing several pounds, in the holes of the coral rocks, beautifully spotted with red, yellow, blue, green, grey, and a little black, but all change into one red color"], [128, "124 OBSERVATIONS UPON in boiling : the other fish are excellent in their kind, and may like all other fish caught on the Florida shore, be eaten with safety, which is not the case always in the Bahamas. From the promontory of key Largo the chain of the Florida keys on the south, and the coast of the. main down to cape Sable on the north, from what was former ly called Richmond bay: this is very shallow and full of grass and mud banks : and a labyrinth of small keys intervene behind the principal ones already described from the Martyr's to key Largo. The Marquis bank and keys and the Mule keys extend for a long distance westwardly from Thompson's island, having no reef in front. Hence to the dry Tortugas bank and keys is twelve leagues terminating the general Florida reef. It has more than once been a matter of discussion respecting the most eligible places for naval and military stations on the keys ; from all the information that has been collected, it would seem that key West or Thompson's island is the best as a naval depot, but probably vessels of small draught might advantageously be placed at old Mata combe, or key Tavernier, as cruisers : at Matacombe a military post might be established equally advantageously as at cape Florida or key West, and it would be mid-way between both : an establishment for the purposes to be mentioned presently might also be made at Ma tacombe, which besides its central situation and fine water, has a pro portion of good land fit for agricultural or at least horticultural pur poses. It would scarcely be worth the expense or trouble to erect permanent sorts at any of these places, and a due consideration of the purposes required to be effected by military and naval posts, will quickly determine which of the three is the most eligible. In the event ofa war, various stations for cruizers would be ap pointed along the extensive general reef, where every vessel bound northward might be watched : the abundance of fish, turtle, and game in and among the keys would prove a constant source of re freshment : from hence also the pirates might be watched, when"], [129, "125 THE FLORIDAS. driven from their haunts and hiding places in the various obscure haunts around the island of Cuba and the Bahama banks. The wreckers have been more than once mentioned and a slight notice of these people may not be unacceptable. For many years wrecking has beeen reduced to a perfect system, and upon the coast of Florida has been engrossed by the inhabitants of the Bahama islands, and principally by those of the island of New-Providence. The usual custom in fitting out these small craft on a wrecking and turtling voyage (for they are generally combined) is upon shares : the merchants of Nassau are chiefly the proprietors of the vessels, into which a few barrels of pork and buscuit are put, the crews being supposed able to subsist themselves by fishing and hunting, and these crews are composed of the pilots and fishermen of the islands. Forty or fifty wreckers have often made their rendezvous at Key Tavernier, which has before been noted as a central position for their purposes, and at these times one or two vessels have been se lected to fish for the others, in which case they always had a share of any booty. On returning to Nassau, the government duties, admiralty fees, the tythe to the resident governor, and a variety of other colonial charges, took on an average thirty-five per cent., from the gross amount of the sales of the property brought in by the wreckers : one moiety of the nett proceeds then fell to the owner and fitter out of the craft ; the other half was divided among the captain and crew in certain shares and portions of shares, as agreed upon previous to the commencement of the expedition. It has been estimated that the duties to the British government alone produced an annual revenue of fifteen thousand pounds sterling from this curious source ; besides keeping a numerous body of hardy and enterprising subjects in employ, and repaying with great profit the speculations of the merchants. It is also a notorious fact that since the termination of the late war, the town of Nassau"], [130, "126 OBSERVATIONS UPON has been almost supported by the wreckers, who are so sensible of the advantages derived from their employment, that they have open ly declared they will never leave the reef, until driven off by armed force, and seem to consider themselves possessed ofa right in the wrecking -ground as their own individual property, independent of any change of government. The great effect of gales of wind upon the Florida or gulf stream, the uncertainty of the line of the eddy, and the numerous baffling currents continually drive the mariner upon the reefs ; the unex perienced navigator too is sometimes by light winds and unknown sets of the gulf accidentally carried within side the reef, through some of the inlets, and when he has got out an anchor, he sees through the clear water, that he is surrounded by rocks and shoals, which are more appalling to the eye than dangerous in reality, often lying in deep places. It is then that the wrecker makes his appear ance, and the frightened master ofa rich laden vessel, is compelled to accede to the terms of the only pilots who can take him safely out, for which in many instances two and three thousand dollars have been paid : there is seldom any competition, for by a point of honour among them no wrecker interferes with the one who first finds the bewildered vessel. The variety of the modes of gain, and the different kinds of im position, smuggling, &c. would fill a volume ; but on the other hand by trusting too much to the captain of the rescued vessel, it has more than once occurred that he has given bills of exchange which have never been paid, and made engagements and promises, which unless fulfilled before the extrication of his vessel, have been bro ken without a scruple when he found himself once more safe in the open sea. In justice to the wreckers among the Florida keys, it must be re marked that much of the abuse which has been thrown upon them is very undeserved, and that where in one instance they are accused"], [131, "THE FLORIDAS 127 of extortion, there are many more where they have been ill treat ed for their services. The idle tales which have been told of their making false lights on the coast, all who have resided in those parts, assure to be un truths. Those fires are occasioned by the hunters and Indians who burn the forests to clear them of underbrush, and to procure fresh pasture for the deer. Lightning also often sets fire to trees, and it is not very uncommon, in dry seasons, to see spontaneous flames arise in marshy places. But after all, what business has a mariner who knows there are no harbours or light-houses on this coast, to follow a light out of his course ? and would it not be ad viseable for all passing along this coast, upon seeing a light to the westward, to look out for breakers if he stands in for that quarter ? We understand that lately a considerable number of small craft, have been sent down from various Atlantic ports upon voyages of wrecking and turtling, but they should be protected in some mode by the American government, and measures taken to prevent the interference of foreigners with their lawful pursuits. An establishment at Old Matacombe would be very convenient, where some authorised persons could reside to regulate by rule and law, to determine upon the rates of pilotage in extreme cases, and prevent imposition on the one hand and the want of a sufficient re muneration on the other. A revenue vessel of light draught of wa ter would be a preventive to many disorders and keep off the Providence wreckers, who might shun an armed cutter when they would laugh at any regulations that were not supported by compe tent strength, and put into effect by force of arms. Sources of considerable profit in various respects are to be found upon the Florida reef, and among the archipelago of keys : the quantity of wrecked property annually thrown here is very great, and can only be fully known to those who have long been in the habit of wrecking : the number of vessels fitted out from Nassau is"], [132, "128 OBSERVATIONS t/PON THE FLORIDAS. the greatest proof. Turtle shell and drift logwood and mahogany are no small branches of emolument ; the quantity of turtle taken is vast : a gentleman in Nassau has amassed a very large fortune lately by purchasing all the turtle not wanted for the consumption of the Bahamas, with which he makes very large quantities of turtle soup : this after being boiled to a hard jelly is preserved in cases perfectly air tight and sent to London, by which the soup in that city can be afforded to be sold at nearly one half the former prices. Would not a similar supply be acceptable to our northern cities 1 No attempt has been made by the author to introduce any sailing directions through this intricate navigation : he refers the navigator to the gulf pilot by captain Bernard Romans, De Brahm, he. from which many of the preceding observations have been abstracted, and which contain minute directions ; the eye is however chiefly recommended, the clearness of the water shewing all dangers. In closing the remarks upon the Florida keys, it is with satisfac tion we find that a minute exploration of them is about to take place under the orders of the general government, and we may shortly expect to find many facts brought to light and many errors correct ed : we may hope that the minuteness and accuracy of the new charts may enable the navigator to avoid many of the dangers, and that a familiarity with the passages, may teach him to pass this long dreaded coast in comparative safety. When a few years shall have induced a trade from the harbours on the western coast of the Florida peninsula, a knowledge of the passes through the keys into the gulf of Mexico will be requisite for the shipmaster to shorten his voyage, and it is not impossible but an intimate knowledge of the navigation may lead to the laying down of some rules for the hitherto dubious courses through the reef."], [133, "129 OBSERVATIONS UPON THE INDIANS The Indians were formerly very numerous in the Floridas, per haps as much so as in Mexico : the histories of Ferdinand de Soto and other early travellers assure us of this fact, and the vestiges that remain to the present day attest it. From various causes how ever, they have gradually, and within the last forty years rapidly disappeared, particularly from East Florida ; and the numerous tribes are reduced to some small bands and a few ruinous villages of indolent dirty vagabonds, wholly unlike the bold character of American Indians. The Floridas having almost constantly belonged to Spain, their mode of considering the rights of the Indians is perhaps the one to he referred to, when that question shall be agitated : and this, be cause their relations with the aborigines of America have been very different to those of most other nations. Having obtained a grant from his holiness the pope, \", he who kept the keys of heaven,\" to all those parts of the western hemis phere they should discover, they made a lodgment on a spot of a province or kingdom, and having fortified it, entered into treaties 1?"], [134, "130 OBSERVATIONS UPON of incorporation with the nearest tribes, and thus gradually advanc ed to those more remote. Cortez varied in Mexico a part of this mode of process, but not the principle : he went straight to the capital, but after becoming firmly footed there, carried on the sys tem of incorporation. The pope made those grants in order to extend the Catholic re ligion, sounded no doubt on the credence of those days in his bound less powers, and on the immensity of .good in the object ; and per haps these were as good data of primitive territorial rights, as those of most other nations : he gave what was not his, and others have taken what was not theirs. However this incorporating system may have been abused in practice, as very many of the intentions of all governments are, when acted upon far from home, it must be allowed that it intimate ly combined benevolence in its leading principles ; that in practice, it exhibited a perpetual reciprocity of interests, and that the depo pulation of the aborigines under this system, has been much less ra pid than in other parts, even where the purchasing system has been preferred. In New Spain but a small defalcation comparatively exists of the Indians, and that may be traced to the amalgamation with the whites ; but where alas ! are the tribes that once inhabited the territory between the Floridas and the St. Lawrence ? We re fer here only to the Spanish continental settlements, for on the islands it would appear that extermination had been the order of the day, and that the after plans of incorporation had grown out of the horrors of those. People of all countries from a remarkable effect of habit, are prone to suppose their method of managing, to be the best and only means by which a desired end can be effected. This doubtless in duced the British government to discontinue the Spanish system of incorporation, upon their obtaining possession of Florida at the peace of 1763 ; for soon after, treaties were held with the Indians,"], [135, "THE FLORIDAS. 131 afid a line of demarcation was established ; pointing out decidedly the lands of the white and red nations respectively : according to the words of the treaty the British government retained the lands, \" all round the seashore back as far as the tide rises ; all the lands on the east side of the river St. John, from its source until it runs into the sea ; all the lands to the westward of the river St. John, that are situated between the sea and a line drawn from the place where the Ocklawaha creek falls into the said river, near Spald ing's old upper trading house, to the forks of the Black creek at Colwill's plantation, and from thence to that part of the river St. Mary which is intersected by a continuation of the line to the en trance of Turkey creek into the Alatamaha ;\" which place upon the river St. Mary is at or near Coleraine in Georgia. The existence of this line, which was actually marked through the woods, has been doubted, but the evidence of its having been fixed remains in the records of East Florida : the older Indians have a distinct idea of it, and the author has heard them allude to it, and they are under the strong impression that it is by that line of demarcation their lands are now to be meted. This treaty was made in 1769 by governor Tonyn. In 1784 we learn that the Spanish government of East and West Florida, met the Talahassy and Seminole Indians in a body, who held those districts with their celebrated warrior McGillivray at their head, and formed and executed a treaty of incorporation, (or rather reformed and re-executed the treaty which the British occupancy and treaty had rendered obsolete) which completely made the In dians of Spain coequal with the whites, and put the sovereignty into the hands of his catholic majesty. That treaty stipulates that the sovereignty, rights and jurisdiction of his majesty, go alike through all parts of these provinces. And this the United States virtually acknowledged in treating with Spain, and Spain only, on the boun dary line between the Floridas and Georgia, and which line was"], [136, "132 OBSERVATIONS UPON moreover run under a military force, expressly to guard against in- terference on the part of the Indians. The same treaty says, that should the Indians be dispossessed of their lands (for they had a right to lands individually but none nationally) his majesty will re munerate them in other parts of his territory. Each Indian had a right to land, as well as and on the same sooting with white, free black and coloured subjects, in any part of the province. However this might have been understood by the Spanish gov ernment, the Indians themselves have always entertained the idea that their boundaries remained as fixed by the British, and their op position to, and final stoppage of the running of the Florida line, de monstrates this, as well as their hostility to any whites who crossed the line. It is a matter of notoriety that no Spaniard, previous to the exchange of flags, dared to cross the river St. John above Buena Vista, and the Spanish governors in their talks from time to time, seem to have tacitly consented to this assumption of the Indians. The history of a purchase made from the Indians, under per mission from and ratified by the Spanish government, proves on the other hand that the Indians could not make sales without their sanc tion, and goes far towards the inlerence that it should rather be considered as a grant from Spain. The house of Panton, Leslie k Co. stands identified with the his tory of the Florida Indians. Spain having received back the Flori das from Great Britain, neglected no step to assuage the regret of the red people, at parting with their friends the British, and to con ciliate their good will. In the earliest meeting, the Indians request ed to be supplied with English goods and by English merchants ; and having been desired by the government, to point out the commercial house most to their satisfaction, among the many with whom they had traded, they chose that of Panton, Leslie $\u25a0 Co. This advantage gained and carefully improved by the principals of that house, men of the first rate talents, information and address, it soon became the"], [137, "133 THE FLORIDAS. monitor of the Indians, the guardian of the tranquillity of the pro vince, and a favorite with the court of Spain. They had several trading establishments in each province, and were allowed to import articles ofcommerce ofevery description free of duties, when foreign goods were so strictly forbidden, that to be detected introducing a single piece of linen, would have subjected by the laws of Spain, any other persons, to the penalty of working in the mines for life. They became the sole suppliers of all articles wanted by the government, garrisons, inhabitants and Indians of East and West Florida. During this lucrative range of political and civil importance, the firm had credited generally and largely the Indians of both provinces, at that time a numerous body : for tribes, afterwards shut into Geor gia, then traded to their stores ; and preferring, as a matter of ac commodation to all concerned to receive a body of land, as a general extinction of those debts, rather than urge individual payments, they obtained permission from the Spanish court to treat with the Indians on that head. A total extinction of debts so easily obtained, was of course pleasing to the Indians, and not injurious to Spain, who held lands only to give to those in whose possession they might become nationally beneficial ; a treaty was concluded between that house and their debtors, and Spain ratified the treaty ; thereby virtually ceding to the house of Panton, Leslie & Co. a territory of about twelve hundred thousand acres for the purposes of discharging the debts of her Indian subjects. These lands which descended to the firm of John Forbes & Co. of Matanzas in the island of Cuba as the surviving partners of the house of Panton, Leslie & Co. are situa ted between the Appalachie and Appalachicola rivers, and are gener ally known as Forbes' purchase. So much would not have been stated on this subject, did it not in volve a curious and important question relative to Florida lands and grants : if the line ofdemarcation laid down by the British, was con clusive against the Spanish government and recognised by them, all"], [138, "134 OBSERVATIONS UPON the grants made by the governors, within the Indian territory, and they constitute a large portion of the whole, may be considered as ab initio void, and the United States may be compelled to obtain the Indian lands, within this line, by treaty and purchase : and on the other hand, should the principle of the Spanish sovereignty over the whole country be adopted, it will naturally scllow that all the bond fide grants made within the Indian territory are binding on the Uni ted States, who are likewise bound to protect and provide other lands for their Indian subjects, should those they occupy be wanted. The Indians of East Florida are supposed not to exceed one thou sand souls ; or upon the widest calculation fifteen hundred : they consist generally of tribes of the Seminole nation, but there are among them many refugees from the Creeks, Choctwas, Alabamas, and other hostile tribes, the scattered remnants of those who in 1810 broke up the Seminole settlements. The first disorganization of the Florida Indians arose, upon the breaking up and retirement of the trading houses of Panton, Leslie k Co. : then came the irruption of the Georgia borderers in 1812, when the Alachua settlements were de stroyed, and their king and chief, Payne, received his death wound in the field : his brother Bowlegs died soon after ofa broken heart and the Indians remaining without a chief of talent or enterprise, order was lost among them : their defeats in 1818 completely broke them up, and 'hey are now dispersed in small squads and single families all over the country : a few still inhabit the small villages between Ala chua and Tampa bay ; mingled with parties of their foes many have come to the waters on the eastern side of the peninsula ; and others emaciated and Daked supply wood to the city of St. Augustine, car ried in bundles on their backs. Among the wanderers are a family of the Euchee nation. The whole of them will no doubt submit to any system that will ameliorate their life which at present is very wretched : they are humbled to the dust. The author was last year a witness to the most absolute state of starvation they were reduced"], [139, "THE FLORIDAS. 135 to, from the loss of their crops in 1821 ; at the period when the at tention of themselves and their negro slaves were directed to the cultivation of their crops, a few worthless wretches from St. Augus tine, for the purpose of alarming the Indians, and inducing them to sell their slaves for almost nothing, a practice of imposition that had often before been practiced, went into the nation and spread reports that two thousand American troops under the command of General Jackson were coming down to expel them from their lands and carry away their slaves and cattle. The Indians upon thi_ abandoned their crops and sold many of their slaves, by which the avarice of the speculators was gratified. It has been reported that a similar expe riment was about to have been tried the last summer, but fortunately it miscarried in its birth. Many of the emigrant Creeks and others who had got down to Tampa bay, and its waters launched their canoes there, and tempted by the smoothness of the summer ocean, ventured along the coast as far as cape Sable, when they became acquainted with the Bahama wreckers, who employed them to hunt on the cape and adja cent keys, in return for bread stuffs and trifling presents ; the game beginning to grow scarce, the wreckers carried a few of them through the reef to the woods immediately west of cape Florida ; large bo dies soon followed and these refugees quickly spread along the east coast as far north as Jupiter inlet. The remnant of the black and colored people who had served with colonel Nichols during the late war, fugitive slaves from all the southern section of the union, as well as from the Spanish planta tions in Florida and from St. Augustine followed upon the steps of the Indians, and formed considerable settlements on the waters of Tampa bay. When the Indians went in pursuit of these negroes, such as escaped made their way down to cape Florida and the reef, about which they were collected within a year and a half past to up wards of three hundred : vast numbers of them have been at differ-"], [140, "136 OBSERVATIONS UPON ent times since carried off by the Bahama wreckers to Nassau, but the British authorities, having invariably refused to allow them to be landed, they have been smuggled into the remoter islands, and at this period, large numbers have been found on St. Andrews and the Bi minis. The chiefs of the outcast Indians who had. by means of the wreck ers found a mode of communicating with the governor of Nassau, once or twice went over, but were coolly treated. On the last vi sit they were imprisoned for a while, and then sent back without pre sents, and the shipmasters forbidden under heavy penalties to bring them over again. For several years past they have been very trou blesome on the coast, plundering the wrecks and destroyingthe game, and at cape Florida have been made the instruments in the hands of one designing individual, of oppressing the very few settlers on that point. At the present time the greater portion of these Indians are about Charlotte harbour ; not more than fifty were on the east coast lately, and were preparing to join their countrymen, on the conclu sion of the hunting season. No greater proofneed beadduced of the impassable state of the country, than the fact of these Indians com municating with Charlotte harbour by coasting round the peninsula, instead of striking directly across, a course which they all unite in stating they have attempted from both sides in vain, being always stopped by the waters of the Never Glade. Whatever steps the United States government may adopt respect ing the Indians, they will doubtless be sounded on principles of jus tice and humanity ; and their efforts will be directed to their im provement and civilization. On this head the author must quote the words of George I. F. Clarke, Esq. of Florida, to whom he is chiefly indebted for the materials of the preceding part of this article. \" The hand of aid and instruction properly extended, will make the Indians serviceable ; they will learn to labor, and our good ex ample will wear out their former propensities.

Are we not all the children of habit, the mere reflection of education and manners ? and why should these be incorrigible ? It is evident, that the only difference in man, laying aside his color, is the difference of opinion ; and that difference of opinion arises from the difference of education. Let the sceptical in this part of the philo sophy of human nature turn his eyes to the city of Mexico, and see there the examples of talents natural and acquired, in the fine arts and belles lettres, manifest among Indians ; let him look into the Hava na and see the many finished workmen in the useful and elegant crafts, to be sound there among the Africans ; let him view man in all parts of the world, where he has had opportunities for his improvement, no matter where born or by whom begot and then let him declare it he is not always the master-piece of Nature's works and the only master of arts. And after thus seeing what he has acquired, will the caviller attempt to say what bounds have been prescribed to his ac quirements by his country or his color ?' 18"], [142, "!38 OBSERVATIONS UPON THE LAND TITLES. The lands which have been granted in both Floridas, under the administration of Great Britain and Spain, are not in their gross amount very considerable, with the exception of the few large con cessions. The questions that are likely to arise upon them, will not probably involve the point of validity except in certain cases, but \u25a0will turn on the location ; as much of the valuable ground is covered by conflicting grants : this will particularly be the case should the old British concessions be admitted to proof, for the lands taken up by them being in general of fine quality, were petitioned for by and allotted to Spanish subjects, and many of the grants for services are located upon these grounds. When Great Britain withdrew from Florida, all her subjects who left the country were renumerated for their lands, excepting it is be lieved, those who remained in the United States or in the Floridas, and the claimants under these circumstances alone can pretend to set up a title. Towards the close of the existence of the Spanish government in the Floridas, and perhaps for ten years previous to the signing of the"], [143, "139 OBSERVATIONS UPON THE FLORIDAS. treaty, the inhabitants foresaw that these provinces must unevitably become an integral part of the United States : They could not but perceive that strangers to their habits, manners, customs and religion would ere long rule the counlry ; and did they not possess some in herent right in the soil, they judged, and not without reason, that they might be lost in the current of the new population. Their lands therefore were to become an indispensible property, and unconnect ed with a government which then supported them, they must obtain tracts either to dispose of at an advantageous opportunity, or for the purpose of bending themselves lo the labors of agriculture. With this prospect, all those entitled to them solicited grants for services, and obtained them by virtue of certain special ordinances from the court of Spain. It was their right so to do, and their motive was as suredly praiseworthy and justifiable : they were prompted by the same sacred instigation that induces the actions of all mankind, in ma king a provision for their offspring. Hence the number of concessions made in the latter years of the government of Spain in Florida, compared with those of the earlier periods : but the circumstance of the 24th of January, 1818, having been fixed upon by the treaty as the date, posterior to which no grant is to be recognized by the American government, will if strictly en forced, cut offa large number of meritorious concessions, which were issued as a reward for services, by virtue of the royal orders before mentioned, particularly the one dated in 1815. The effect of these orders being to remunerate citizens for beneficial acts done to the government, it would seem almost proper to infer that all, who might thenceafter make out their right of reward and the previous non-re muneration, had an inchoate title created to their respective quotas from the very date of the order, although they happened to apply for them after a certain day which was not finally determined on until twelve months from it had elapsed : hence two equally deserving in dividuals having applied for their several bounties, earned painfully"], [144, "140 OBSERVATIONS UPON by their blood and toil, on the 23d and 25tb of January, 1818, respect ively ; the one would have a good title, and the other be excluded by the treaty and be deprived of his reward. There was no time fixed for the inhabitants to come in and claim their concessions, and many delayed from that assurance, and from a want of means to pay the fees upon their preliminary titles. Upon the subject of the date of the 24th of January, 1818, exten sive legal opinions from American and Spanish jurists have been gi ven, which go the length to state, that by the constitution of Spain ; (which was promulgated at Cadiz on the 19th March, 1812, and af ter a bloodless revolution was on the 7th March, 1820, adopted as it was originally made, and then sworn to by Ferdinand the seventh) the king had not the power to do any act, which took away property from a Spanish subject ; and the eighth article of the treaty which did so, by the act of fixing the date, was not confirmed by the Cortes, but only the second and third articles, which transferred the sover eignty and the public lands to the United States. As we are not lawyers we quit this subject, having ventured upon it but for a moment, to plead something on behalf of those Floridians whose titles are destroyed by the treaty, without any fault alleged or implied of their own. The investigation of the various intricate claims in Upper and Lower Louisania, have brought to light a variety of the usages of the Spanish government, respecting the mode of granting and taking up lands ; and from the statements made in Congress, and more par ticularly the learned elucidation afforded by Messrs. Barton and Ben son, much of the mystery thrown around them has been cleared up. It is now admitted, that the fact of an actual survey or location, is by no means to be assumed as any criterion of the validity ofa claim : it would be a rule indiscrimiate in its character, and not distinguish ing between valid and invalid concessions. Isa concession be good or bad, it is so from causes and facts anterior to the fact of survey or"], [145, "THE FLORIDAS. 141 location, and wholly independent of it ; it is so from causes co-eval or co-existent with the issuing of the concession or warrant itself ; it is either good or bad then, and the subsequent location or survey happening sometime after, and dependant on circumstances of per sonal convenience or personal influence, is wholly immaterial to the intrinsic merits of the concession. In fuller corroboration of this fact it must be mentioned, that in Florida when the unconditional grants for civil or military services were made, the petitioner often named a place which was specially stated in the grant ; but when upon examination, the spot he had chosen was found to have been already taken up, he was allowed to locate elsewhere, and the survey and plat returned accordingly ; up on the well recognized principle that the grant, being made without prejudice to a third person, held good against the government when once issued, to be located elsewhere, when the specified spot was oc cupied. Among the various modes in which lands are occupied in Florida, some are by grants from the crown of Spain direct : others from the governor general of Cuba, but the most from the colonial governors : some are held by a written permission for certain purposes, such as erecting mills or bridges ; and in some instances land is occupied, the original tenure to which was from the verbal permission of the governor. This practice was always countenanced by the Spanish government, in order that poor persons when they found themselves a little at their ease, might at their own conveniency apply for and obtain complete titles : in the meantimesuch imperfect rights were suffered by the government to descend by inheritance, and even to be transferred by private contract : when requisite they have been sei zed by judicial authority, and sold for the payment of debts. In making the grants for services it was not contemplated either by the authorities or by the individuals, that these lands were to be actually occupied : most of the grantees were in some capacity or"], [146, "142 OBSERVATIONS UPON other holders of offices under the government, and resided in St. Augustine, and wished to continue there : the Spaniard is different from the American in all his habits, and more particularly as a set tler ; he is fond ofsociety, and could not exist on a remote farm se veral leagues from a neighbour, passing the greater part of his time within his own domestic circle. Like the French the Spaniards are social beings, and love towns and villages and groups of habitations. The plantations in Florida were with sew exceptions cultivated by English settlers, or by those Spanish subjects who by an intercourse with Georgia, had adopted the American customs. In anticipation of the exchange of flags, during the last two years of the Spanish government, those who had money or influence pro cured their surveys, such as they are ; but all could not be accom modated, nor was it material to the validity of their concessions by the laws and usages then existing. The returns of these surveys were by an authorised surveyor, who deposited his plat in the no tarial office, being sworn previous to each location to the due per formance of his duty. With respect to the powers of the governors to make grants, it seems doubtful whether they had any other limit than the discre tion of the confirming tribunals : although the author has taken much trouble, he has not been able to find whether they were limit ed to any extent in granting. Stoddard in his interesting sketches of Louisiana expresses an opinion, that the powers of the lieutenant governors or sub-delegates were discretionary ; but from other sources we know, that about 1801 the governor of Louisiana was restricted in the extent of his grants, particularly to new settlers. From the best sources of information we find, that the governors ef Florida were authorised from time to time to grant lands, by virtue of certain royal orders direct from the court of Madrid, to new set tlers who became Spanish subjects, and the quantity granted was in proportion to the family and slaves held by the applicant. Grants"], [147, "THE FLORIDAS. 143 to a large amount have been thus made by the governors, condi tioned for the confirmation in proportion to the number of settlers or slaves brought in ; upon due proof of which, the number ofacres pro rata were patented to the colonist with a royal title. Any inhabitant or new comer could also obtain a grant for lands, on condition of his occupying, planting and cultivating the same for ten years, erecting buildings, &c. ; at the expiration of the time, upon sufficient proof, the royal title of full concession was made out to him ; but many of the inhabitants who held lands under similar conditions, which had long been complied with, neglected to take out their royal or confirmatory titles, which under the Spanish gov ernment was not obligatory upon them, and besides the fees were somewhat expensive ; but upon the knowledge of the cession, num bers crowded to prove the fulfilment of their grants ; and most of the records from 1818 to 1821 are filled with royal titles predicated upon former conditional grants, the articles of which had been com plied with. The titles made by Spain, being held by the treaty binding on the United States, to the same extent that they would have been valid under the dominion of the former, will smooth all difficulties arising under patents dated previous to the 24th of January, 1818 ; but the many claims posterior to that period, which will be clamorously urged, will cause the treaty of cession to be brought up at a future day for construction, before the supreme court of the United States ; yet the question will never be fully set at rest, until Congress have invested the judicial departments of the government with authority to try and investigate it. The boards of commissioners with their limited powers, are good enough for the purposes for which they were created ; to ascer tain the quantity claimed under Spain, and to confirm their plain concessions ; but they have not power, nor can Congress give-"], [148, "144 OBSERVATIONS UPON power to Commissioners as such, to adjudicate conclusively against the individuals. Let us hope that the long contests in Louisiana and Missouri respecting land claims, may not be repeated in the case of Florida ; and that prompt and efficient measures may be laid, for the conclu sive adjustment of all the titles in the territory : until this is done all population, all settlement will be withheld ; nor would the in troduction of the public lands to the market tend to smooth difficul ties : on the contrary it would onl^ transfer the law suits to the purchasers. Disputes between the United States and a portion of the citizens of Missouri have existed nearly twenty years, origina ting in grants made by France and Spain. The general proposition that a citizen should have a remedy to determine his rights, where the same subject happens to be claim ed by both the government and the individual, appears too obvious ly just and necessary to require illustration in any ordinary case. In the determination of these claims Floridais materially interested : they are interspersed through a large portion of the territory, in all directions. The disputes that may and will arise on some or all of these claims, unless immediately adjusted, will have a tendency to nrevent emigration, at least to the central parts, and to throw the population into distant detached settlements ; and will prevent some of the best of the province from being brought into the market, peopled and cultivated. The first years of the Spanish government after re-occupying the Floridas, seem to have passed away without many grants being made ; except confirming in their possessions, such of the British subjects who chose to remain upon their lands or lots. In the year 1793 a royal order came out from the Spanish court, authorising the governors to make grants to new settlers or inhabitants, condi. tioned for the performance of some acts of public utility or for the complete settlement of the lands."], [149, "145 THE FLORIDAS. Another ten years rolled away, and about 1803 a new order ar rived, under which considerable tracts of land were granted I in 1809 a royal cedula appears to have authorised the issuing of grants as rewards for civil or military services ; and in 1815 another man date from the king of Spain, authorised the governors to make con cessions for similar services ; this latter order being issued upon the special representations made to the Spanish government, of the losses sustained by the inhabitants from the revolutionary proceed ings of 1812. It is not distinctly understood to what amount the governors were limited ; probably the quantum was left to be deci ded upon by themselves, in proportion to the merits of the several applicants : in the list of grants issued as a reward for civil and mi litary services, the largest quantity does not exceed fifty thousand acres, except in one instance, viz. the grant made on the 19th ot November, 1810 by governor White, to Don Pedro Miranda, as a reward for his various services expressed in the concession. The several orders to the governors or sub-delegates of Florida coming direct from Madrid, and regulating the mode of making grants in certain cases, do not appear to have interfered with the general standing instructions to these officers, for issuing conces sions in the ordinary routine ; nor with the power of the governor general and intendant of the island of Cuba, to order concessions to such persons as he judged proper : in virtue of this authority, the governor-general granted to the commercial house of Don Fernan do de la Maza Arredondo and Son of the Havana, on the 17th of December, 1817, a large tract of country situated around the old Indian town of Alachua, upon the fulfilment of certain conditions. This immense concession has been surveyed, and Messrs. Arre dondo and Son having sold out to various persons, settlements have been established upon it, and measures taken for the compliance with the terms of the grant, the period for which is extended by the terms of the treaty. Several companies have been formed for the 19"], [150, "146 OBSERVATIONS UPON purpose of colonizing here ; one among the farmers of New-Jersey, another in New-York known as the Florida Association, ke. The settlers upon this tract will form a centre for a population in the very heart of the country, should the measures of the government not be prejudicial to their intentions. A recapitulation of the places upon which concessions have been made, will put into one view their extent. The neck of land between the rivers St. Mary and St. John on the north and south, the Atlantic ocean on the east, and the King's road from the Cowford ferry to Coleraine on the west, is entirely covered by grants in occupancy and cultivation : this is the northern division mentioned in the historical observations. South of this division the grants extend on both sides of the river St. John, as far almost as the head lake : upon Dunn's lake and Haw creek, andupon most of the other tributaries of St. John, particu larly Pablo and Black creeks : over the plains of San Diego, and upon each branch of the North river : almost entirely through the Twelve-mile swamp and its ramifications : the principal part of all, and the entire of the choice lands southwardly, from St. Augustine to Tomoca river, east of the main road, besides the banks of all the small water courses. The concessions are close together upon the front of Halifax ri ver to Mosquito bar, and the deserted town of New Smyrna ; thence in a similar way to Mosquito south lagoon to the Haul-over isthmus ; and also occupy the rich hammocks or swamps running parallel to the coast, a mile or two west of the front water courses. The banks of Indian river and its north-west branch, northwardly from the Haul-over are likewise occupied ; likewise southwardly, though not without some vacant spots to St. Sebastian river. Thus far the concessions have been made without the old Indian boundary line ; whereby the peninsula from the head of St. John's river, and between the right bank of that stream and the Atlantic"], [151, "147 THE FLORIDAS. ocean, may be considered as almost entirely covered by various grants ; and it is a matter of question whether the federal govern- ment should or should not be at the expense of sectioning this and the preceding northern divisions of the territory : the surplus lands would invariably be of inferior quality and could never repay the expenses of the survey. On the other hand, if an act of Congress relative to this matter be carried into effect, it will be the means of settling the boundaries of numerous concessions which otherwise may long remain in suspense. This act provides that the public surveyors are to mark off each claim as allowed by the commission- ers or otherwise, from the loose mode of surveying generally hith- erto used in Florida, but a very small number of the few lines ac- tually marked through the woods are distinct, and therefore almost all the located as well as the unlocated grants will require to be marked out ; which if done otherwise than by the government sur- veyors, at the contract price of four dollars per lineal mile, will put the proprietors to an enormous expense, which they are at present unable to afford : moreover if they are left to regulate their own surveys, litigations will unavoidably arise, which would be avoided were the location made by impartial persons, as the government surveyors cannot but be. The application of the universal system of sectioning, would fur- ther produce an intimate topographical knowledge of the country, so highly desirable, that should the United States not carry it into effect, the author considers it a subject proper for the consideration of the territorial legislature : the local contribution, raised among the proprietors and claimants of the land within the district treated of, would be infinitely less to each individual, than the amount they would have to pay to their private surveyors ; and the country would at once be accurately known, the boundaries of each tract conclusively fixed, and general satisfaction would be produced. Upon the western side of St. John's river the grants are much"], [152, "OBSERVATIONS UPON 148 less numerous, but are disposed over a large portion of country ; many are placed upon the shores of the Ocklawaha river, and not a few through an imaginary hammock which was supposed to extend from that stream to the Alachua territory : no such hammock is known to exist ; but the creek which flows from the eastern end of Orange lake into Ocklawaha river, called Orange lake creek, has a narrow skirt of thick swamp on each side which the claimants of the lands may probably not find so desirable as the rich luxuriant hammock which they had been taught to expect. Several large concessions are in the heart of the peninsula ; among which particularly is the one upon Alligator creek of eight miles square ; and the great Alachua grant before mentioned made to Arredondo and Sons ; the Miranda grant, upon the waters of Tampa and Hillsborough bays ; a grant upon the Coolasahatchie, and some others. During the period of the invasion of the Indian territory from Georgia, a great number of tracts of land were run out in the Alachua district for the conquerors, by surveyors whom they brought in their train, of which plats were made ; the persons employed on these surveys seem to have taken some pains to define the respective al lotments, for in traversing through the district, the lines are occa sionally seen very distinct ; so that should the claimants come for ward they will have much less difficulty in finding their lands than many who have obtained grants under more peaceable circum stances. The author has been informed that copies of most of the plats are in the hands ofa gentleman in Georgia. We shall conclude the account of the various grants of land made in the Floridas, by giving the boundaries of the three celebrated grants made to the Duke of Alagon, the Count of Punon Rostro, and to Don Pedro de Vargas, respectively. The two latter individuals received compensation for what they were deprived of by the treaty, but the Duke of Alagon having fallen into disgrace, received"], [153, "149 THE FLORIDAS. not the equivalent he was entitled to by the new constitution of Spain, and it is said that his remonstrance upon the stretch ofpower used by Ferdinand the seventh in depriving him of his lands, caused his banishment. Whatever was the cause of his losing the smiles of his royal master, it is well known that he is now in exile in one of the Italian states, and under the surveillance of the Spanish mi nister. How precarious is the tenure by which a courtier holds his unenviable situation ! GRANT TO THE DUKE OF ALAGON. This grant appears to have been made upon the 17th of Decem ber, 1817, in consequence of the Duke's application made on the 12th of July preceding : Letters patent were issued on the 6th of February, 1818, to the governor of Cuba and the council of Indies to give effect to the grant and on the 26th of June of the same year formal possession of the lands was delivered to the Duke's agent by the governor of East Florida. These lands according to the words of the concession include \u2014 \" All the uncultivated land not ceded in EastFlorida, which lies between the rivers Saint Lucie and St. John, as far as the mouths by which they empty themselves into the sea and the coast of the gulf of Florida, and the adjacent islands, with the mouth of the river Hijuelos in the 26th degree of latitude, following the left bank up to its source ; drawing a line from lake Macaco, then descending by the way of the river St. John to the lake Valdez, crossing by another line from the extreme north of the said lake to the source of the river Amanina, following its right bank as far as its mouth in the 28th deg. 25th min. of north latitude, and running along the sea coast, with all the adjacent islands up to the mouth of the river Hijuelos.\" , Of this large concession the Duke of Alagon after the confirma tion of the treaty by the United States in 1819, but before the ex planatory ratification by the king which annulled his grant, conveyed"], [154, "150 OBSERVATIONS UPON the western portion to Richard S. Hackley an American citizen and formerly consul from the United States at Cadiz : the extent of the lands held by Mr. Hackley is marked upon the map of Florida. GRANT TO THE COUNT OF PUNON ROSTRO. This grant was also made on the 7th December, 1817, upon the same day with the concession to the duke of Alagon, in consequence of a petition presented by the count upon the 3d day of November preceding : this grant does not appear to have been perfected : it includes \u2014 \"All the vacant lands not heretofore ceded in Florida, ly ing between the river Perdido, westward of the gulf of Mexico and the rivers Amanina and St. John, from Poppa* to the point where it empties into the ocean for the eastern limits ; and for the northern, the boundary line of the United States ; and to the south by the gulf of Mexico, including the desert islands on the coast.\" It has been said that the count of Punon Rostro was indemnified for the loss of this concession, by a large grant of crown lands in the heart of old Spain ; which to him was doubtless no disagreeable ex change : besides he appears never to have taken possession of the land?, or done any other act of ownership. GRANT TO DON PEDRO DE VARGAS. The petition for this grant was not made until the 25th January, 1818, and the concession issued on the 2d of February : the gift be stowed upon this favored courtier is described as being \" The pro perty of the land which lies comprised within the followtng limits, that is to say : from the mouth of the river Perdido and its bay in the gulf of Mexico following the sea coast, to ascend by the bay of Buen * Poppa is the name of an antient Spanish fortification on the west bank of St. John's liver opposite to Picolati, where (here was a ferry : these two forts are situa ted at the north end of a large bay of th\u00a9 river, which extends south as far as the old fort of Jiuena Vista- this bay was formerly called Lake Valdez."], [155, "THE FLORIDAS. 151 Socorro and of Mobile, continuing by the river Mobile until it touches the northern line of the United States, and descending by that in a right line to the source of the river Perdido, and following the said river Perdido in its lower part, and the bay of that name returns by the sea coast towards the west, comprehending all the creeks, entries and the islands adjacent, which may belong to Spain at the present time till it reaches the west line of the United States, then returning by th ir northern line, comprehending all the yacant lands which be long or may belong to Spain, and are in dispute or reclamation with the United States according to the tenor of the treaties : and also all the vacant lands not ceded to any other individual which are between the river Hijuelos in East Florida and the river St. Lucie, drawing a line from the source of one river to the source of the other, and fol lowing by the coast of the gulf of Mexico from the mouth of the Hi juelos to the point of Tancha, and doubling this by the coast of the gulf of Florida to the mouth of the river St. Lucie with the islands and keys adjacent.\" The equivalent given to Don Pedro de Vargas for the annulment of this grant was according to report an extensive monopoly in certain branches of commerce in the Spanish colonies ; which upon reflecting that the principal part of this immense concession (comprehending all the counties of Escambia, Jackson and Dural, and large parts of St. John's county together with the lads in dispute now part of Alabama) is after all dubious both as to right of granting and good quality, and point of time, was a most superabundant remunera tion. In the early grants the amount of land conceded appears to have been computed in cavallerias and sometimes in peonias. The esti mation of the former in Florida is that it contains thirty-three and one-third American acres : of the latter the relative value is one fourth of the former. By the law of the Indies {Recopilacion de las leyes de los Indios) published at Madrid in 1776, a work similar to a digest of the statute'"], [156, "152 OBSERVATIONS UPON os one of our states, a peonia is described to be \"a lot of fifty feet wide and one hundred deep : cultivatable ground for one hundred bushels (fanegas) of wheat (trigo) or barley (cebada) ; for ten of Indian corn : two roods (huebras) of land for a kitchen garden (hu ertd) ; and eight for saplings of fruit trees (arboles de secadal) : pasture land for ten breeding sows (puercas de vientre) : twenty cow's and five mares (yeguas ; one hundred sheep and twenty goats.\" By the same statute a cavalleria is defined as containing a lot of one hun dred feet wide and two hundred deep, and in all other respects equal to five Peonias. In the island of Cuba the lands are granted in a circular form : the location being determined by fixing upon a known spot as a cen tre, and the terms of the concession are so much lineal distance upon each point of the compass (sobre cada viento.) These circles are supposed to be tangential, and the spaces between them are called tierras realengas, (vacant or royal lands.) But as they actually in tersect each other in almost every instance, endless lawsuits, dis putes and contentions arise. Probably to obviate this, or perhaps to comply with the usual mode of laying out lands in Florida, the very sew grants which have been made in this mode specify that they are to be equal to a grant of so far sobre cada viento, but to be laid out in a square form.* In concluding these observations upon the Floridas, and their va rious resources, which have been drawn up from a variety of docu ments published and unpublished, as well as from the numerous * The author in the first part of these observations upon land titles, derived much assistance fi-om the interesting speech made by Mr. Barbour in the house of repre sentatives in congress, when treating of the Louisiana land claims ; the circumstan ces were so very applicable to Florida that many of the remarks have been closely copied. This ought to have been acknowledged in the Introduction."], [157, "153 THE FLORIDAS. notes taken by the author and his friends in the territory, he re spectfully entreats that the public will discriminate between what he has stated as actually now to be sound in Florida, and the infe rences he has drawn as to what it is capable of being made. So many false lights are held out upon the opening of a new coun try to induce emigration thither, that he feels a natural anxiety lest what he has pointed out as the probable future, may be interpreted as the existing present. In dividing his remarks he has endeavour ed to obviate this impression, and he momentarily intrudes to re move it. Florida is now a republic; unshackled by the restrictions of a monarch, or the despotic sway of an inquisitorial governor, who in many instances united the legislative, judicial and executive powers, jt will soon develope the real extent of its capabilities. The sanguine disposition of some may carry them in their enter prises beyoud the bounds of prudence, and their failure in certain cases may be quoted against the country : caution and prejudice may withhold numbers from joining the population or embarking in any bus certain undertakings ; but enough will be sound whose enter prise, energy, and perseverance, will place things in their proper light and prove the general truth of the propositions which have been advanped in favour of the Floridas. With a superficial extent larger than the state of New-York, with a climate in most parts as salubrious as the rest osthe United States, with a soil capable of producing more than one lucrative staple, it is surely no visionary hope that we indulge when we look forward be yond the few years that are to intervene before Florida takes her natural post of importance in the Federal Union.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. A PROCLAMATION. Whereas a treaty of amity, settlement and limits, between the United States of America and his Catholic Majesty, was concluded and signed between their Plenipotentiaries in this city on the 22d day of February, 1819, which treaty, word for word, is as follows : TREATY of amity, settlement and limits, between the United Stales of America and his Catholic Majesty. The United States of America and bis Catholic Majesty desirino- to consolidate on a permanent basis, the friendship and good correspon dence which happily prevails between the two parties have deter mined to settle and terminate all their differences and pretensions by a treaty, which shall designate with precision, the limits of their re spective bordering territories in North America. With this intention, the President of the United States has fur nished with their full powers, John Quincy Adams, secretary of State of the United States ; and his Catholic Majesty has appointed the most excellent lord Don Luis De Onis, Gonsalez, Lopez y Van,"], [161, "AP PENDIX. 157 lord of the town of Ray aces, perpetual Regidorofthe corporation of the city of Salamanca, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal American Order of Isabella the Catholic, decorated with the Lys of La Ven dee, Knight Pensioner of the Royal and distinguished Spanish Or der of Charles the Third, member of the Supreme Assembly of the said Royal Order of the Council of his Catholic Majesty, his Secreta ry, with Exercise of Decrees, and his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary near the United States of America. And the said Plenipotentiaries, after having exchanged their pow ers, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles. ARTICLE I. There shall be a firm and inviolable peace, and sincere friendship between the United States and their citizens, and his Catholic Majes ty, his successors and subjects, without exception of persons or places. ARTICLE II. His Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States, in full property and sovereignty, all the territories which belong to him situated to the eastward of the Missisippi, known by the name of East and West Florida ; the adjacent islands dependent on said provinces, all pub lic lots and squares, vacant lands, public edifices, fortifications, bar racks, and other buildings which are not private property, archives and documents which relate directly to the property and sovereign ty of said provinces are included in this article. The said archives and documents shall be left in possession of the commissaries or offi cers of the United States, duly authorised to receive them. ARTICLE III. The boundary line between the two countries, west of the Missi sippi, shall begin on the gulf of Mexico, at the mouth of the river Sabine, in the sea, continuing north, along the western bank of that river to the 32d degree of latitude ; thence by a line due north, to the degree of latitude where it strikes the Rio Roxo of Natchitoches or Red river ; then following the course of the Rio Roxo westward, to the degree of longitude 100 west from London, and 23 from Wash ington ; then crossing the said Red river, and running thence by a line due north, to the river Arkansas ; thence following the course of the southern bank of the Arkansas, to its source, in latitude 42 north ; and thence by that parallel oflatitude to the south sea. The"], [162, "158 APPENDIX. whole being as laid down in Melish's map of the United States, published at Philadelphia, improved to the first of January, 1818. But, if the source of the Arkansas river shall be found to fall north or south of latitude 42, then the line shall run from the said source due south or north as the case may be, till it meets the said parallel of latitude 42, and thence along the said parallel t,o the South sea : all the islands in the Sabine, and the said Red and Arkansas rivers, throughout the course thus described, to belong to the United States ; but the use of the waters and the navigation of the Sabine to the sea, and of the said rivers Roxo and Arkansas, throughout the extent of the said boundary, on their respective banks, shall be common to the respective inhabitants of both nations. The two high contracting parties agree to cede and renounce all their rights, claims, and pretensions, to the territories described by the said line, that is to say, \" The United States hereby cede to his Catholic Majesty, and renounce for ever, all their rights, claims, and pretensions, to the territories lying west and south of the above de scribed line; and in like manner, his Catholic Majesty cedes to the said United States all his rights, claims, and pretensions, to any ter ritories east and north of the said line, and for himself, his heirs and successors, renounces all claim to the said territories for ever.

ARTICLE VI. The inhabitants of the territories which his Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States, by this treaty, shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States, as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the enjoy ment of all the privileges, rights and immunities, of the citizens of the United States.
