Since the first volume of these Letters was published, events in the East have advanced with rapid strides. The Porte has replied to the unjust ap-jjression of the Czar by a declaration of war : England and France, after a series of negotiations equally long, patiently continued, and iruitlcss, have armed in concert, and, uniting their forces, have marched to the assistance of the Sultan in a righteous but unequal contest ; and, whilst we are tracing these lines, a French and an English army are, for the first time since the twelfth century, encamping together on those famous fields and plains which their ancestors trod in company when fighting under the banner of the Cross. In antici pation of the expected conflict (perhaps the most consi derable event in European history within the last half century), an extraordinary increase of curiosity, mingled with warmest sympathy, has been manifested towards the Turks. The public have not been content with seeking information from books, newspapers, maps, and diplo matic documents ; numbers have gone to study Turkey on her own soil, and to test even on the battle-field her new and reformed system. This general pre-occupation of the public mind has been a fortunate circumstance as regards myself, in par- a2"], [14, "AUTHOR'S PREFACE. IV ticular by establishing the correctness of the facts and statements given in my first volume. Translated into Italian shortly after their publication, the ' Letters on Turkey' have come to be regarded as a standard au thority in all that relates to the Ottoman empire ; and it may be affirmed, without exaggeration, that almost all the numerous publications on Eastern affairs which have appeared either in France or foreign countries during the last eight months have taken their materials and opinions from this work. It is true that writers who have done me the honour to borrow- from me have not always con sidered themselves obliged to indicate the source from which they drew so largely. Such, in particular, appears to have been the feeling of the author of a volume pub lished in England, under the title of ' The Ottoman Empire and its Resources. London, 1854;' the second part of which work, devoted to statistics, is merely a compilation from, and often a literal reproduction of, my ' Letters.' In many instances, indeed, neither the substance nor the form has been changed, nor anything omitted, except the name of the real author. About two-thirds of the present volume now appear before the public for the first time. That portion which relates to the history and condition of the Greeks under Ottoman rule is extracted from the ' Moniteur,' in which it was originally inserted during the course of the year 1852, but in a form less regular and complete than the present. The accuracy which I have from the first endeavoured to bring to my task, and to which its success may be principally attributed, has been even more difficult to"], [15, "AUTHOR'S PEE! V attain in this second part than in the former one. The difficulty has arisen from the nature of the subject, \u2014 the investigation of the Ra'iah communities of Turkey. If, in fact, these communities are themselves in the greatest ignorance of their own affairs, by reason of the mystery in which the patriarchates studiously enshroud themselves from the eyes of their dependents, how much more difficult must it be for a foreigner to penetrate this darkness ! But I have spared no pains in the seeking to distinguish the truth from amidst the official falsehoods (as they may be termed) in which it is hidden. I have drawn my information from the sources least liable to suspicion, have carefully weighed conflicting testimonies, and, when my facts have been doubtful or insufficient, I have pre ferred an omission to an error. The ancient and bitter animosities which divide the Christian communities subject to the Porte, the jealousy and detracting spirit which infects them all, have aug- mented the difficulties of my task. My aim has been to avoid all personality, whilst at the same time I have com- mented freely on facts and circumstances, and endeavoured to describe them with perfect impartiality. If I have not succeeded in representing things as they actually are, I have at least shown them as I saw them myself. My judgment may be called in question, but not my honesty of purpose. After treating in succession of the Osmanlis themselves, and of the non-Musulman subjects of the Porte, in order to complete the picture of the Ottoman empire as it now exists it would be requisite to give an account both of the tributary or vassal nations, such as the Servians, Moldo-"], [16, "AUTHOR'S PREFACE.

The idea of this Translation arose many months ago. Its progress through the press has been impeded from various unavoidable causes, and we might have been deterred altogether from adding \" another pebble to the heap \" of works, original or compiled, that have appeared since the beginning of the year on the exhaustless and little understood subject of \" The East.\" Among all these publications, however, none gathers so many important points into one view; not one, we believe, professes to give more than a casual and general notice of the non-Musulman subjects of the Porte ; and none, that we know of, is so well adapted to correct, not by opinions or arguments, but by the plain statement of simple and authentic facts, the ignorance, and the false impressions, which so extensively prevail 'in this country concerning the condition of the Christians in the East; and, indeed, concerning the Turkish empire aud the Musulman religion generally.1 1 Since the preceding lines were penned, we have received an urgent request from some friends now at Constantinople, who saw these sheets in MS., to hasten their publication."], [18, "PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR. VIII The author, M. Ubicini, from his intimate knowledge of the subjects concerning which he writes \u2014 a knowledge acquired during a long residence in the countries then selves, and kept up by his constant communication with the best informed and most influential persons in those countries \u2014 is well entitled to be listened to with more than common attention ; and he is, in fact, so listened to in France, where his works are regarded as a standard of authority. Our design originally was to have given a translation of the first volume of this work (the only one then pub lished), which treats solely of the \"Ottomans;\" and con siderable progress had been made, when the fact mentioned by M. Ubicini in his preface2 was discovered. Whilst con sidering how far the plagiarism alluded to rendered it worth while to continue a genuine translation of this work, M. Ubicini courteously proposed to place in our hands, as they came from the press, the following sheets, on which he was then engaged. The subject having been hitherto but little handled, and being particularly adapted to the circumstances of the moment, which daily gave rise either in parliament or the press to discussions on the position of the Christians in Turkey, and the relations between them and their Ottoman rulers, it appeared desirable to proceed in the first instance with the present volume, which, being a distinct work, complete in itself, loses little or nothing by being published apart. Its pre decessor, however, contains so extremely interesting and valuable an account of the institutions, statistics, and 2 See AutL e, p. iv."], [19, "PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR.

At the same time a considerable per sonal acquaintance with some of those countries had made us more alive to the ignorance and misrepresentation which have taken hold of the English mind respecting them, and also enabled us to estimate the accuracy of M. Ubicini's statements. We hope that a perusal of the following Letters may at least help to make one truth apparent, though it may surprise some people to be told that the tyranny and oppression which the Christian, and especially the Greek subjects of Turkey, are so generally believed to be groan ing under, and concerning which they so eagerly pour forth complaints to all who will listen, are often mere groundless inventions, or the grossest exaggerations. This assertion, however startling, will bear probing. We beg to quote the apposite words of a gentleman whose evidence is authoritative on all matters relating to the East.3 \" No traveller in Turkey ever yet entered a town or village inhabited by Christians in which he was not immediately surrounded by a crowd of idlers, with the Kodja Bashi, or primate, at their head, all anxious to relate some tale of cruelty or oppression. If he be (as is generally the case) ignorant of the language, the story 3 Mr. Austen H. Layard. a 3"], [20, "X PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR. will lose nothing of its horrors by being reproduced to him through his Greek dragoman. Should he really desire to investigate the various complaints thus poured forth to him, he will find for the most part they are utterly untrue, or rest upon the slightest possible foundations ; and pro- bably the very persons accused have been standing by all the time. It is no uncommon sight, either in the capital or the provincial towns, to see a group of Greeks or other Christians in a coffee-house engaged in heaping upon the Turkish Government and the Turkish authorities every term of abuse which their language affords, while a party of Turks are sitting quietly by listening to all this treason- able language and treating it with the most perfect in- difference. The impunity with which Christians in Turkey state and exaggerate their grievances proves of itself that their grounds of complaint are not great. Would the inha- bitants of a village in Poland, Lombardy, or anv Christian country under an absolute government, dare thus openly to vilify it, and appeal, as these people do, to a passing stranger? But in Turkey there is no secret police, no espionage ; a Christian is safe in his own house. He mav say what he pleases, read what he pleases, and pray as he pleases ; and he frequently does pray weekly, if he be a Greek, for the overthrow of 'the infidel' and the speedy triumph of the Czar.4 And yet, after all this, we are seriously told that he is living in the most abject slavery, rhe victim of the most terrible oppression and cruelty !\" 4 Prayers to this effect have been introduced by the priests under Russian influence into many of the churches of Bulgaria aud Roumelia."], [21, "PREFACE BY THE TRAN! I XI There are persons who understand the subject well, and whose opinions, therefore, are worthy of respect, who consider that, of all the errors and misfortunes of Greece, none has been greater than the revolution of 1821, which gave her a German prince for a monarch, and German idea? and affinities as guarantees of her liberty ; and who infer, from the extraordinary progress and development of her commerce, wealth, and education during the quarter of a century preceding that event, that, had Greece remained tranquil and undisturbed, under the suzerainty of the Porte, and been in a situation to partake the benefits of the progressive reforms of which the Edict of Gulhane' is the corner-stone, she might by this time have risen almost to a par in power and import ance with her Ottoman rulers. Montesquieu has affirmed that the Greeks were better protected and more prosperous under their Turkish conquerors than under the Greek emperors ; and we beg to ask attention to this fact from those who believe that it is only within these few years, and in consequence of her weakness and need of Christian help, that Turkey has ceased to regard her Christian subjects as dogs, or cared for their well being. \" Travellers,\" says Mr. Monckton Milnes,5 \" see so small a portion even of the surface of Oriental life, and are not only so ignorant of what lies below it, but have so misapplied and falsified even the external relations of social existence in those countries, that one is almost 6 Preface to 'Palm Leaves,' p. 13."], [22, "PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR. XII afraid to conjecture where so many have been deceived. We have taken our notions of Eastern domesticity so much more from the theatre than from reality, and coloured them with so much ferocity and vice, that what is really commonplace becomes paradoxical. The general mass of Tours, Travels, and Journeys, especially in the East, merit no other destiny than to interest the few who are already interested in the author, or at best to serve as guide-books to sights and curiosities for those who intend to go over the same ground.\" It would be well, however, if the negative virtues of these Tours and Travels were limited to the modest influence here assigned them, but unfortunately they have proved the prolific sources of error. Every tourist who takes a \u2022 eks' run to Constantinople and the Levant comes back with a budget full of crude and partial information hastily picked up by the wayside, and probably thinks it necessary to write a book, or, at any rate, a long in some popular periodical. One traveller copies from another, and thus by the great influx of travellers of late years into Turkey error has been more and more widely disseminated. After reading the reports of some travellers, one might well be surprised on visiting Turkey to meet with any Turk working, or any Greek above the con dition of a slave or a serving-man. It would be diverting, were it not lamentable, knowing the floods of misrepre sentation which will ensue, to watch the way in which tourists, especially if they are supposed to entertain any project of printing, are sometimes taken hold of and inoculated with some particular bias to suit the views of"], [23, "PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR. XIII the ready informant. It is this sort of travelling that has produced such books as some that have lately appeared ; 6 aud while we acquit their authors of an intention to mis lead, we must severely blame them for having given currency to such inaccurate statements. Another great cause of the mistakes and misrepresenta tions into which travellers fall, next to their usual igno rance of Oriental languages, is the disregard and contempt they indulge for the religion of the country, arising out of their total ignorance or misapprehension of the nature and spirit of that religion, and of its practical effect on the whole of Musulman life. \" No stronger instance can be given of the slight attention hitherto paid, even by thoughtful men, to the real question of the East, than the usual estimation of the character of Mahomet.\" The religion taught by the Prophet deserves not the reproaches that have been cast upon it, nor the horror with which it has been invested, because we have been content to take for granted, without further investigation, that the Musul man creed is a compound of sensuality, intolerance, and imposture. But, as M. Jonesco observes in his letter,1 Christian and Musulman both worship one God ; and however the Musulman in his pride may, and often does, look dowrn on Christianity as a faith inferior to his own, he bears it no intolerant hatred. He may be indifferent, but he is not systematically hostile ; nay, on the contrary, a belief is cherished by many who have arrived at more enlarged philosophic views, that the day is destined to 6 See Quarterly Review, No. 138, p. 538. 7 See Appendix, p. 446."], [24, "ACE BY THE TRANSLATOR. XIV arrive when Islamism and Christianity shall approach, unite, and be blended in one ! What, too, was the often repeated saying of the late Sultan Mahmoud, that \" hence forth he wished to know the Christian only in his church, the Jew in his synagogue, and the Musulman in his mosque \" ? We do not mean to affirm that there is not still, and will not be for many years to come, a great amount of bigotry and fanaticism existing among the remote and ignorant population, and in certain cities aud districts ; but we do say, that, ju=t as we Christians are no longer exactly what we were three or four centuries ago \u2014 since we no longer burn heretics or witches, or pretend to exorcise evil spirits \u2014 so have Mahommedans, in tbe progress of time, likewise undergone a change. Many of them are becoming more enlightened, more philosophic, aud, looking beyond the letter of the Koran, seek for its spirit. It is this which has enabled Mahmoud and his son Abdul Medjid to accomplish inno vations and reforms without destroying the edifice of the empire, and being themselves buried in the ruins. Time was, in the days of the Crusades, and when Islamism menaced Western Europe by the sword of the Kalifs, that it might have been well to stimulate Chris tian zeal by regarding the founder ofthe Musulman faith as a vile impostor, and making the very name of Turk another word for savage ; but now all that has passed away, our tasks and duties should also undergo a change. We ought now to substitute investigation for prejudice, and accuracv for exaggeration. J OO The Turkish empire is as interesting and important at the present day as when, three centuries ago, the power"], [25, "lCE BY TH1 XV of the Grand Signior was felt from the gates of Vienna to the frontiers of Barbary. It then aroused the fears, it uow fixes the hopes, of civilized Europe. We have ceased to dread a barbarous invasion of Moslems, and we seek, on the contrary, to render the Moslem a rampart against the invasion of Northern despotism. AVhen Europe was sunk in barbarism and ignorance, the Musulman Arabs were the guardians and dift'users of all the science and learning that existed in the world ; and they probably deserve our gratitude for saving the \"ark of civilisation\" as much as ever the Greeks did in more ancient times. The Arabic numerals in constant use daily attest our obligations ; and the faithful repro duction of some of their highest works of art constitutes at the present hour one of the principal enjoyments of those who go to admire at Sydenham the wonderful combination of colours, and the exquisite variety, harmony, and grace, that rendered the Moorish Alhambra one of the wonders of the world. But what concerns us, and what we have now to do with, is not the past but the present condition of Musulmans, particularly of the Turks. The question is not what they have been, but what they are ; the past is only practically interesting as it may assist in guiding our anticipations of the future. We entered into the late war for the assertion of a great principle ; but we knew not when we did so whether the \" sick man,\" whose house we determined to defend because it was unjustly attacked, was capable of raising an arm to protect himself. It has been with some wonder and much respect that we have beheld the calm, unanimous resolve of the nation, and the moderation, firmness, and"], [26, "PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR. XVI dignity of the government, in defending their indepen dence against the overbearing aggressions of Russia ; whilst our admiration has been called forth by beholding the courage and perseverance manifested by the troops of the Sultan in defence of Silistria and Kars, and in tbe various military operations on the Danube. We had perhaps somewhat forgotten the noble attitude of the Porte in iboO, when, alone and at her own extreme peril, she withstood the unjust demands and combined menaces of her two powerful neighbours, Austria and Russia, and magnanimously refused to yield up to them the Hungarian fugitives, Kossuth and his companions, who, after being defeated in their patriotic struggle, had sought an asylum in her territory. She refused to betray the unfortunate who had committed themselves to her protec tion ; and to the resolution and good faith with which she befriended them in their utmost need, do they owe their lives and future career, if such be in reserve for them. But whether the proofs of energy and vitality given by Turkey since 1850 reveal a capacity for occupying an independent part on the stage of European politics, and fit her to engage in the struggle, henceforth inevitable, of modern civilisation, is not now our province to discuss. One of her main sources of weakness is the uncultivated condition of wide tracts under her rule of the finest land in the world. Amongst the modifications and arrange ments which must ensue now that the war is happily brought to a close, M. Ubicini suggests that Turkey, in exchange for certain worn-out and obsolete privileges, should confer on Europeans the right of possessing landed property within her territories. What an open-"], [27, "ICE BY THE TRANSLATOR. XVII ing might this not become to internal civilisation and commerce ! \u2014 what a means of reclaiming the waste spaces, of removing one of the great blots and reproaches of the country, to wit, the want of due cultivation, and of assimi lating and removing the barriers between the different races of its inhabitants ! What a prodigious development of her internal resources might we not hope for under the action of Western capital, industry, and science ! In some such measure as this may be found after all the solution of many cf the difficulties that now surround the Eastern question. We have dwelt too long perhaps on the vindication of the Turks, but it has been one of our chief objects to show how much this people has been misunderstood in England, and how much their faults and imperfections have been exaggerated, and their virtues ignored ; deem ing it most important in the present condition of Eastern affairs to prove that, whatever be the vices and errors of the Turkish government, yet that under its rule Christians may flourish, read the Bible, acquire wealth and education, and enjoy very considerable social and political privileges. Do we then pretend to affirm that the Christian popu lations in Turkey are animated by a warm attachment to Musulman rule ? Far from this : it would not be true of the majority, though it might not be untrue of all. Neither do we mean to affirm that their condition, even at the present day, is free from grievances ; or that the remembrance of the far more serious grievances of former days does not still rankle at the core : but what we do say \u2014 and what, we think, recent events entitle us to say \u2014 is that, whatever be their situation in Turkey, the great"], [28, "PREFACE BY THE TRANS1. XVIII mass of Christian subjects of the Porte would not willingly see the rule of the Sultan exchanged for that of the Czar. In the following translation we have paid more attention uracy than to style ; for our sole ambition has been to render the author's meaning and spirit as faithfully as possible. The sentiments and opinions, as well facts, belong entirely to M, Ubicini; and the translator is responsible only for the Preface, some notes which are distinguished by the letter T. affixed to them, and the \" Conclusion,\" which, though framed upon that of M. Ubicini, it was found necessary, owing to the rapid of events, to write afresh ; and, in so doing, much new matter crept in. A few tuumportant or tedious de tails aud repetitions have been here and there omitted : such omissions, however, are very trifling ; and there are one or two passages which, not being clear in the original, have remained obscure in the translation. The candid reader is requested to bear in mind that the author, being a Roman Catholic, and addressing his work to those of the same creed, naturally sees things through a Roman Catholic medium \u2014 and therefore often writes with a bias towards his own church, which would appear strange if coming from, or addressed to, Protestants. Some discrepancy will be observed between the state ments of M. Ubicini concerning the Protestant missions in Turkey, and those subjoined by us in a note, on the autho rity of Lord Shaftesbury and some others.9 It should, however, be remarked, that M. Ubicini does not prose?? in this instance, to give the results of his own personal expe- 9 Debate in the House of Lords, 10th March, 1854."], [29, "PREFACE BY THE TRANS] XIX rience aud knowledge : and that the authorities he quotes are, on the one hand, M. Bore, a Roman Catholic priest, and head of a Roman Catholic and rival mission, and therefore scarcely likely to be perfectly impartial ; and, on the other, a work written above twenty years ago ; ' wiiilst the present Protestant movement in Turkey, the labours ofthe American missionaries, and the recent liberal ires of the Sultan Abdul Medjid in favour of the Protestants, have all taken place within the last ten or twelve years, and therefore subsequently to Captain Slade's remarks quoted by M. Ubicini. Had the latter, at the time he was writing, been aware of the facts stated in the House of Lords, we feel confi dent, from his candour and general accuracy, he would given them due weight in his view of the Protestant prospects in the East ; and we must frankly and consci entiously acknowledge that Captain Slade's account was perfectly true at the period of its publication. Let us be thankful that so happy a change has since then taken place ; and rejoice that a truer pattern of what Chris tianity really is, and what its followers ought to be, is now likely to be exhibited to the eyes of tbe Musulman. Hitherto, judging from what he has seen, he has believed that the Greeks and the Latins prayed to pictures and images, and that the Protestants never prayed at all ! What wonder, then, if the Musulman, whose religion is the fundamental principle of his life, should have looked on ail alike with lofty indifference ; or that, whilst he tolerated and protected, as the Koran commanded, those 1 Slade's ' Records of Travel.'"], [30, "XX PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR. who professed a creed inferior to his own, he attempted not to disguise the contempt that lurked at the bottom of his heart for the men whose religion, if it existed at all, had no visible influence on their conduct?

In proportions of colossal grandeur, with aspect at once majestic and mild. she seemed to reign over the sanctuary. On her right hand, and of similar proportions, were the figures of the Emperor Constantine and of another personage, probably John Pal\u00e6ologus, the last of the Christain emperors who contributed to the restorations of St. Sophia.

But the feeling against this interpretation was too power ful. The contrary doctrine which was maintained by Ebou-Hanifc, the first of the four great orthodox Imaums, accorded better with the enthusiasm of the Uniformists, and consequently prevailed. Within ten years from the death of the Prophet, Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Persia had sub mitted to the Musulman invaders. In ten years more they had spread themselves over Africa as far as the Pillars of Hercules ; thence crossing the Straits, they drove the Goths from Spain, and the whole of Europe seemed at one moment on the. eve of becoming Musulman. Such was the spirit of the Musulman conquest, and history shows that their mode of acting upon it was uniform.

But apostates and idolatrous Arabs had not even this option. They were compelled to choose between Islamism and the edge of the sword, according to the text of the Mi which declares them to be Muhab, or beyond the pale of the law. Before advancing a step into an enemy's country, the commander of the Musulman army, in obedience to the example of the Prophet5 himself, issued the following summons : \" Health and prosperity to all who walk up rightly and believe in God and his Apostle. We desire you to confess that there is but one God, and that Mahomet is his Prophet.\"6 If vanquished, they were forced to submit to the tribute, and their country- formed a part of the Dar-ul-Islam ; though they might remain under the government of their own chiefs, or become in corporated with the Musulmans,accordingto circumstances. 5 The Prophet never attacked any body of troops, however small, without first appealing to them to become converts. \" If the appeal is successful, we forbear to fight with them, because the object of the is obtained.

On these conditions the Kaliph insured to the Christians the safety of their lues, their goods and places of worship : and promised not only that they should not be disturbed, but that if need were they should be protected in the ex- of their religion. ''Labour, pay, and pray as you will,\" was the maxim constantly employed by the Musul mans towards the races they conquered. Nor was it de parted from at the capture of Constantinople. Tlie Greeks having become ra'iahs.' that is to say, subject to the Karadj, were permitted to retain their civil laws, their tribunals, and the exercise of their religion.8 The ceremonial observed at the election and investiture of the Greek Patriarchs continued nearly the same as under the Byzantine Court.1 The Sultans, successors of Mohammed II. , observed scrupulously the conditions of the treaty to which he had sworn ; and so far from seeking to diminish the privileges of the Raiahs, they rather con tributed to extend them, sometimes even to the detriment of their own interests. A church might occasionally have been converted into a mosque, contrary to the treaty ; but even in the most oppressive periods of Ottoman rule, the religious liberty of the Greek Christians was never interfered with, nor the rights of the Patriarchs disturbed.

And the same was seen centuries ago. Much has been said of the proselytising spirit of the Turks, though in fact nothing is more contrary to their principles, nor more at variance with their practice. Un like the Christian, the Musulman looks not upon the human race as one vast brotherhood, to which he himself belongs. He offers no prayers for the conversion of the infidel, aud he suffers no sorrow from the reflection that millions of his fellow-creatures are in danger of being cut off from the eternal happiness which God has promised to the elect.

As the morahty of Islamism is less pure in its source than that of Christianity, so is its relative inferiority as a political institution. All, in fact, that Islamism aspires to, is that the whole earth should embrace the Musulman faith, or become tributary to those who hold it : in other words, that the Church should pay a ransom to the Mosque. Whilst Christianitv desires the conversion of the Gentiles, in order that, the name of the Almighty may be glorified throughout the world, and that all mankind may become partakers of the eternal happiness of heaven The Otto mans have always carried out their doctrine in their practice ; and whilst nothing is so rare as to find one of them change his religion, on the other hand they have never attempted to make proselytes among their ra'iahs. This has been a great political error. Even at the pre sent day, if a Frank,' or any subject of the Porte, present himself in order to make profession of the Musulman faith (and this is no uncommon occurrence), the cadi re ceives his overtures with extreme reserve, and as though he were acting under compulsion of the law. He is in continual alarm lest the ambassadors of the Christian powers should accuse him of attempting to make pro selytes. Experience has shown him that the Frank who volunteers to embrace Islamism rarely does so from con- B 3"], [46, "10 In trod.

It is related that a stranger one day presenting him self before the grand vizir Raghib Pacha, declared that the Prophet Mahomet had appeared to him in person, inviting him to become a Musulman; he had, therefore, hastened all the way from Dantzic to make his public profession, impatient to enjoy the privileges that belonged to the true faith. \"Here is a pretty fellow !\" exclaimed the vizir ; \"he would persuade us that the Prophet has appeared to him \u2014 an infidel \u2014 at Dantzic too, whilst he has never vouchsafed such an honour to me, who have passed my life in the land of true believers, and for three-score and ten years have never once missed the five daily prayers I\" He then commanded that the candidate for Islamism should forthwith receive fifty sound blows of the stick in order to try his faith. The sequel of the adventure (which is related in the ' Memoire the Baron de Tots) shows that the vizir was right in the zeal of such neophytes. At no period of history does it appear that the Porte has ever made the least attempt to introduce religious uniformity into its dominions by compelling its Christian subjects to abjure their faith : only if any one did voluntarily embrace Islamism, and afterwards returned to his former faith, he was put to death.9 must not, however, suppose that the indifference of i, in conformity with the posi the Ko: teen 1 irrence \u25a0 a consider ; ir throughout the European press, and 'if which I .-' ipeak hereafter."], [47, "11 Introd. .MUSULMAN INDIFFERENCE TO CONVEB tiie Musulman to the work of conversion is inconsistent with a large measure of fanaticism. Satisfied \u25a0 superiority of his own creed, though careless about its adoption by other men, the true believer, and especially the Osmanli, looks down on all other religions with haughty contempt, modified only by the natural bene volence of his disposition.

As if there were some innate repulsion in their very natures, which death itself cannot destroy, the Arab proverb says, \" Mingle in the same vase the blood of a true believer and that of an infidel, you will see them separate of themselves.\" This prejudice, most deeply rooted in the feelings of all Musulman nations, has been productive of a two-fold evil to the Turks : the exclusive spirit which it generated, isolating them from other nations, caused them to remain stationary ; whilst the impassable boundary it traced be tween them and the races they had conquered, prevented all amalgamation between them."], [48, "Introd. 12 LETTER- ON TURKEY.

The degraded Greeks, who had bent a willing neck to the yoke of servitude, and in whose souls the woi J patriotism had long ceased to find an echo, bore up with fortitude against a trial which they dignified with the name of martyrdom. This sort of persecution, for such it was in their eyes, kept alive their religion, and conse quently their nationality. They also looked with hope towards the other nations of Christendom. Inhabitants of a land still teeming' with memories of the crusades, they persuaded themselves that Europe must once again take up arms in their behalf. But the same memories were not less vivid in the minds of the Turks. The atrocities formerly perpetrated by the soldiers of the cross, the battle-cries of Christendom which responded to the groans and complaints of the Greeks, the voices of princes and pontiffs summoning their subjects to arms : such recollec tions as these were not adapted to inspire the Turks with the most kindly feelings towards their Christian subjects. The earlier sultans, as M. Bore well remarks, were en gaged in a perpetual struggle against all the monarchs of Christendom ; and were too well justified in fearing that their ambitious policy, concealed under the mask of religious zeal, would seek to make the Christian popula tions of Turkey subservient to their own ends.

But in a country where the law had simultaneously a civil and a religious action, such a union, though legally possible, became in fact impracticable. The law being one and indivisible rather in its essence than its application, the authorities eh. its execution were consequently invested with a double character, and would naturally be drawn to make distinctions between those whi and those who rejected its spiritual jurisdiction.

The Turks were destined to learn the lessons of a more con ciliating and a wiser policy by experience only and by the progress of time. The Turks, as we have seen, overthrew the administra tions, institutions, customs, and hierarchy, which they found existing in the Eastern Empire ; but they did not impose on their new subjects either their own forms of ad ministration, or their civil law, which was written in the book of their religion. When they wanted money, being masters, and strong enough to require no disguise for the tribute they imposed, they merely fixed the sum which eacli district, town, or village, was bound to furnish ; leav ing it to the inhabitants themselves to apportion the con tribution, and collect it as they chose. This was the origin of those distinct municipalities, often totally independent of the political government, which we find in all parts of the Turkish territory ; and, although at first sight they may seem the offspring of 2 Cantemir, \u2022 Histoire de l'Empire Ottoman,' vol. ii"], [52, "16 Introd.

In this local organisation, and the financial system based thereon, Mr. Urquhart imagines he has discovered the true source of the vitality of the Ottoman empire.3 Its conservation appears to me, however, to depend upon other causes than the existence of Greek municipalities in Roumelia and Bulgaria ; though the influence of these in the maintenance and development of races, and in the rvation of creed and nationality, is an incontestable truth. Thus it is that in Turkey, excepting the Jews, (who there, as elsewhere, have remained stationary), the populations who have always preserved their municipal organisation have changed the least, as we see in the Greeks, Armenians, and a portion of the Bulgarians : whilst the Albanians and Sclavonians, who from the earliest times have been subject to military chiefs, speedily adopted the creed of their conquerors.

The islands of Spezzia and Hydra enjoyed that species of commercial navigation, based upon the equal division of profits, which gave so great an impulsion to the Greek navy, and procured for it the monopoly of the carry ing trade between the Mediterranean and Euxine Seas. These rapid advances must not be ascribed entirely to the civilising spirit of the Greek race. Were this the sole cause, it would be impossible to account for the fact that in the Christian villages of Turkey we find a greater amount of prosperity and comfort than in those of Greece ; and for this other, and still more remarkable fact, that since the formation of the modern Hellenic kingdom, the tide of emigration, naturally expected to flow from Turkey into Greece, has in reality set in the contrary direction, 4 For a very interesting account of Ambelakia see also Urquhart's Spirit ofthe Eaat.'"], [54, "Introd. 18 LETT) I URKEY. so that during the three years from 1834 to 1836, nearly 60,000 individuals quitted their fatherland to take up their abode in Turkey.

The movement which is now taking place in the midst of the Christian races of Turkey, and which may end either in the dismemberment or regeneration of the Empire, is produced by two causes. Oue of these is the strength which nations subjugated, but not wholly crushed, find in themselves and in their traditions, which urges them sooner or later to seek their emancipation either by isolated or united efforts, according to their affinities of religion, language, or geographical position. The other is exterior, and consists in the secret influence exercised over the subordinate population by a power inimical to the Porte."], [56, "20 LETTERS ON TURKEY. The name of this power has already been pronounced by all ; it is Russia.0 The ambitious views of Russia, and her projects on Constantinople, are no longer subjects of political speculation, but matter of history of no recent The correspondence of the Prince de Ligne con tains some curious details. The Prince writes as follows, in a letter dated from Baghtchcserai, in the Crimea, on 1st of June, 1787 : \" Their Majesties now and then touched on the subject of those poor devils of T^irks, and some hints were thrown out in a quiet sort of a way. As an amateur of antique virtue, I spoke of re-establishing the Greeks, and talked of Alcibiades ; Catherine was for resuscitating Lycurgus and Solon ; but Joseph, who thought more of the future than the past \u2014 more of the positive and practical than the ideal, exclaimed, ' What the devil will you do with Constantinople ?' It appears to have been during this visit, to the Crimea that the project of seizing on the Ottoman territory was agreed upon between Catherine II. and the Emperor Joseph, though the final details of its dismemberment were pro bably reserved for future discussion. At a later period the Emperor Alexander was less scrupulous: openly speak ing of the necessity of Constantinople forming part of his empire. ' Russia,' said he, ' must have the key of her own house.' \" Two methods of accomplishing this object appear to have occurred to Russia. The one, plain and undis guised, was an armed invasion of the Ottoman territory on the first plausible pretext, and at the first opportune moment.6 This w.s written in 1S52. 6 This was written in"], [57, "21 Introd AMBITIOUS VIEWS OF RUSSIA. To this, however, more than one objection presented itself. Would the European powers, after becoming in 1841 guarantees for the integrity of the Ottoman empire, remain passive spectators of the struggle as in 1788, and more recently in 1828 ? In the event of such a violation of existing treaties, their interference would become not only a right, but a duty. In the next place, was there nothing to be apprehended from Turkey her self, even though wholly unaided ? More than one ex periment of this kind might have supplied food for reflection, if not for discouragement, to the adversaries of the Porte. A note of Count Pozzo di Borgo, quoted in the preceding volume, proves what an unexpected resist ance tbe Turks were capable of opposing to the Russians in 1828. When the news of the rupture between Russia and the Porte reached Paris and London, France and England, who by their neglect of Turkish interests had not a little contributed to the crisis, looked on the Sultan's cause as lost : and before field-marshal Wittgenstein had even crossed the Pruth, were already concerting measures to prevent the Russians from reach ing Constantinople. The Czar alone more accurately- ap preciated the present situation and prospects of Turkey ; and had only been induced to make his attack lest he might let slip an opportunity that would not again occur. The note just referred to says,7 \" When the Imperial cabinet was debating the question whether the time were come to take arms against the Porte, the urgency of the 7 Dispatch of Count Pozzo di Borgo, Russian Ambassador in Paris, dated November, 1828, cited in the Portfolio, No. 7."], [58, "22 LETT'.

Ex perience has now shown us that we have taken the right course. The Emperor has put the Turks to the proof, and found them entering into a physical and moral organisation to which they had hitherto been strangers.

Turkey herself perceives, and endeavours to avert it by taking the initiative in reforms. In consonance with this idea, we have seen, since the promulgation of the khatti cherif of Gulkhane, ancient distinctions abolished ; all subjects, Musulman or Christian, comprised in the general denomination of Tebdh (subject) ; practical equality before the law, the personal security and free enjoyment of property guaranteed to each individual. On one point, however, we must not deceive ourselves ; the numerous obstacles which the Sultan has to encounter while labouring in the cause of reform, and striving at the eleventh hour to produce unity in the empire by giving satisfaction to the demands of liberty and civiliza tion, arise not among his Musulman subjects alone, but often from the Christians themselves. The lessons of experience and sound policy, frustrated a5 they frequently are by the pride and religious pre judices ofthe Osmanlis, as often fail of success with the subject races, by reason of similar pride, by the remem brances of former humiliation, and by the hate and thirst for vengeance ever brooding in the hearts of the vanquished, and continually fomented by Russian agency. The individuality of races, which the new system of equality of rights tends to destroy, was efficaciously main tained by the distinctions of the old regime ; and I have frequently observed men of influence among the raiahs regretting the removal of the former evils of servitude, and rejecting systematically, and through a fancied patriotism, the successive ameliorations introduced by the Porte.

True it is, that for such a population, rendered distrustful by the memory of long oppression, the difficulty is to forget ; their own salvation however, no less than that of Turkey itself, depends on the fulfilment of this condition. At the present crisis then, the question of races is the question of the maintenance or approaching dismember ment of the empire itself. Considered apart, the races in Turkey may be separateil into two distinct groups. We may range on one side those populations that are immediately subject to the au thority of the Sultan, hitherto confounded under the general denomination of Raiahs ; and, on the other, those which are simply tributary, and which, though politically dependent on the Porte and recognised as belonging to the empire, possess, generally speaking, a distinct legisla tion and internal government. Our present business is with the first of these only. The Raiahs, or non-Musulman subjects, may be sub divided into five classes or communities, designated offi cially \" milleti khamsa (the five communities),\" governed, under the control of the Porte, by their respective Patriarchs, and by the Grand Rabbi of the Israelites. These are : \u2014 1. The Greek nation or community (roum composing all the Ottoman subjects professing the orthodox Greek religion, in number about 6,000,000. 2.

The Israelite nation or community (iehoudi milleti), about 150,000. We shall consider each of these communities separately ; commencing with some detail of their past history, and proceeding to examine their present situation. The history of subjugated nations is everywhere the same ; or rather they possess no history. Years and ages roll away : generation silently succeeds generation with out apparent change. But on a closer examination we shall perceive that this immobility is only external. Something is ever at work beneath the surface : the heart is alive. Like those rivers which disappear beneath the earth, an ear applied to the soil will catch the deep murmur of the waters below : a few leagues farther on the stream gushes forth entire. Such is the state of the Christian populations under Ottoman rule. They not only do continue to exist, but increase ; and to such an extent that from time to time the Sultans have taken alarm at this prodigious multiplication, and formed the project of wholesale extermination.

Such is the history of the past. The study of the present will comprise, for each of these races in particular, an account of the reforms of the Porte during later years, with statistical researches respecting their population, finances, political state, morality, industry, and religion, and the instincts and dispositions that they manifest. By the aid of this double investigation we shall endeaveur to anticipate the future.

Accia juoli, a Florentine adventurer, had already conquered Attica. Cyprus was subject to a prince of the house of Lusignan. The Morea only, and, at the other extremity of the empire, Trebisond, celebrated in the romances of medi\u00e6val chivalry, still preserved a national existence under the family of the Comneni. That exhaustion which affects races as well as individuals, the deterio ration of the national character, and the pernicious influence of schism and religious controversy, had in the course of time produced this dismemberment and accele rated the fall of the empire. On the 29th of May, 1453, after a siege of fifty-two davs, Constantinople fell into the power of the Otto mans. The emotion caused by this great event, which brought the Turks in less than half a century to the gates of Vienna, and had thus gone near to change the whole face of Europe, quickly subsided in the West. It was an event very striking to the imagination, but, in the opinions of those days, not materially affecting the political interests of the Western nations. The Turks hitherto had not excited much attention in Europe ; and the Greeks, known chiefly by the memory of the Lower Empire, called forth slender sympathy. The spirit of the Crusades had expired, and Christendom beheld with indifference the fall of Constantinople.

Throughout the East, however, the sensation was painful and profound. Stupor soon gave place to general mourning : all Greece felt the blow. In the Morea and in the islands the people fled without knowing whither to go. The sea was covered with ships loaded with the families and property of the fugitives. They sought refuge in the mountains, in the monasteries, and in the islands occupied by the Genoese and Venetians. \"It was,\" say the chroniclers of the time, \"a dispersion like that of the Hebrews after the fall of Jerusalem.\" 2 Many fled to Transylvania, Hungary, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and Apulia ; and even the vast plains of Kouban and Tartary received a portion of the fugitives. The mass of the nation, however, still continued to inhabit Constanti nople and the provinces, and many who had fled during the first panic afterwards gathered courage and returned. In fact the behaviour of the conqueror afforded no grounds to justify either the fears of the Greeks or the exaggerations of their historians. If we were to give credit to the accounts of these latter, we must believe that more than 40,000 persons were slain, and 70,000 reduced to slavery, in a city whose total population, according to 2 Villemain, ' Essai sur l'etfat des Grecs depuis la conquete Musul mane.'"], [67, "31 Letter I.

The loss of life was, under the circumstances, in reality small, and con fined to those who fell victims of the fury of the victors in the first moments of success. According to Gibbon,3 '' In the first heat of pursuit about two thousand Chris tians were put to the sword, but the victors acknowledged that they should immediately have given quarter, had not the valour with which they were at first resisted prepared them for a similar opposition in every part of the capital. As soon as the death of the Emperor Con stantine and his chosen band was known throughout the city, the inhabitants of every class, age, and sex crowded for refuge into the church of St Sophia, which they had lately abhorred and shunned as polluted by the recent celebration in it of the Latin mass.4 The doors were broken open with axes, and, as the victors encountered no resistance, their bloodless hands were employed in selecting and securing their captives. Above 60,000 of these unfortunates were transported to the camp or the fleet, or dispersed in servitude throughout the provinces of the Ottoman empire. Amidst vague exclamations of bigotry and hatred the Turks were not accused of a wanton or immoderate effusion of Christian blood, but, according to their maxims, the lives of the vanquished were forfeited, and the legitimate reward of the con querors was derived from the sale, the ransom, or the service of their captives. The wealth of the conquered 3 ' Decline and Fall,' vol. vi. ch. 68, pp. 311 to 319 (Milman's edition). 4 Gibbon, p. 298. \" No sooner had the church of St. Sophia been polluted by the Latin sacrifice than it was deserted as a Jewish synagogue or a heathen temple by the Greek clergy and people.\""], [68, "Letter I. 32 LETTERS ON TURKEY. city had been granted by the Sultan to his victorious troops, and the rapine of an hour is more productive than the pillage of years.

On the eve of the assault he had thus ad dressed his soldiers : \" The city and the public buildings are mine ; to you I resign the captives and the spoil, the treasures of gold and beauty ; be valorous, rich, and happy.\" Though blood had stained the steps of the churches and palaces, the edifices themselves had every where been spared. Mohammed, on entering the dome of St. Sophia, beheld a zealous Musulman in the act of destroying the glorious mosaics with which it was adorned. One blow of the scimetar reminded the trans gressor that the public monuments were reserved for the prince. From St. Sophia he proceeded to the august palace of Blanquernes, the last residence of the Greek emperors. On entering its deserted hails, a melancholy reflection forced itself on his mind, and with deep feeling he repeated a distich of Persian poetry:7 \"The spider has woven her web in the palace of C\u00e6sar (kausar), and the owl sings her watch-song on the towers of Efrasiab.\" 5 The total amount of spoil has been estimated at four millions of ducats: about one-fourth of this was the property of the Venetians, Genoese, Florentines, and merchants of Aneona.

He had long resolved to establish the capital of his empire on the same commanding spot which had been chosen by the first Constantine, but Constantinople \"had lost a third of its population by the disasters of war and by the flight of its inhabitants, and it was necessary that this void should be filled up. Mohammed, therefore, issued a ferman enjoining all the Greeks dispersed through Roumelia and Anatolia to take up their habita tion in the capital on pain of death. The same ferman likewise promised all those who had fled beyond the limit of the Ottoman rule the protection of their property and the free exercise of their religion, and, assured on these points, they returned in crowds. Before the end of September five thousand Greek families had arrived from Trebisond, Sinope, and other ports in the Black Sea ; and more than ten thousand other persons from 3! bria, Adrianople, Silistria, and Heraclea.8 Henceforth Mohammed made it a rule, on capturing a city, to com pel the inhabitants to furnish a certain contingent to the metropolis.9 The Greek race nowhere appears to have offered a very determined resistance. During the century and a half that the Ottomans had been established in Asia Minor, they had had time to become accustomed to their future rulers.

The horror they had originally felt towards the Turks had become somewhat softened by time, and was far exceeded by their hatred for the Latins. They deemed the city of Constantine less polluted by the presence of infidels than it had been by those whom they repudiated as heretics. The first minister of the unfortunate Constantine was heard to declare that he had rather behold in Constan tinople the turban of Mahomet than a cardinal's hat. A sentiment so unworthy of Christians and patriots was familiar and at last fatal to the Greeks. II. Let us here pause for an instant, and, discarding from our minds Greek exaggerations, endeavour to define with precision the new situation in which the conquest placed the nation. This situation was impressed with the cha racter of unity [forme unitaire~\\, which was tbe peculiar and constant feature of all Musulman organisation. In Europe, in Asia, and in Africa, wherever the Musulman conquests prevailed, this form remained invariable ; for it was founded on the text of the Koran itself, and neither Mohammed II. , nor any other Musulman conqueror, had power to alter what the Prophet himself had already settled.1 In Turkey it was perhaps more strongly deve loped by reason of the governmental genius of the Otto man race. The Greeks, under the designation of Ralah (flock), retained their churches, the free exercise of their See Introduction, pp. 4-7, 13, 18."], [71, "35 Letter I. THE PATRIARCH. worship, aud the right of administering their own affairs. The churches in Constantinople, with the exception of St. Sophia (the conversion of which into a mosque is so bitterly deplored by Phranza and Ducas), were shared between the two religions ; their limits were reciprocally fixed ; and the Greeks then, as at a later period the catholic aud schismatic Armenians (for the raiahs were classed by distinction of religion, not of race), formed an extensive community quite distinct from the conquering nation, and under the government of their own Patriarch assisted by the Holy Synod. When I come hereafter to speak of the constitution of the Greek church, I shall endeavour to explain accurately the spiritual character of the Patriarch, and his attri butes as Orthodox Pontiff. In this place we have only to consider his temporal authority, as it was established by Mohammed H., when that monarch conferred on him civil supremacy, and at the same time rendered him responsible for the conduct of his flock. The power and prerogatives of the Patriarch, as chief of the Greek nation, are set forth at length in the khatti- cherif promulgated by Mohammed, at the time of the installation of the Patriarch Gennadius. By this khatti- cherif (considered by the Greeks as their constitutional charter, and many provisions of which still remain in vigour) the Patriarch enjoyed the rank of vizir, and was entitled to a guard of Janissaries. Being both head of the church and archbishop of Constantinople, his tribunal was competent to decide all civil and correctional causes within his diocese \u2014 such as marriage contracts, divorces, legacies, and testaments ; and also larcenies and other"], [72, "Letter I. 36 LETTERS ON TURKEY. offences of minor importance. This tribunal, composed of the principal dignitaries of the lay2 clergy, assembled twice in the week. Among the punishments it was compe tent to inflict were imprisonment, and even in certain cases sentence to the galleys. All the cadis and military gover nors were bound to execute the decisions of the Patriarch referable to the Greek Christians, and likewise those of the bishops in their respective dioceses. The Patriarch maintained a permanent agent at the court of the Sultan, under the name of Kapou Kiaia, through whom his reports were presented to the Divan, and fermans and other official communications received in reply. The Patriarch was elected by the synod, and presided over it by right. This body, composed originally of all the metropolitans and archbishops residing at Constan tinople, formed, as it were, the council of the nation, representing, in a measure, the legislative authority of which the Patriarch was the executive. From this body emanated all decisions and regulations concerning the church, and an appeal lay to it from the judgments of all subordinate courts. It also administered the revenues of the church and the nation in general. The amount of these revenues, arising from sources to be hereafter detailed, was paid into the patriarchal or public treasury. Among other expenses charged upon this fund, a sum of 25,000 piastres was paid annually to the government under the name of \" present ;\" which exempted the whole of the arch- Letter II., p. 129."], [73, "37 Letter I.

The Turkish authorities were bound to assist the Patriarch and other members of the clergy in recovering when necessary their dues and revenues. E^ery bishop, whether metropolitan, archbishop, or suffragan, enjoyed in his diocese the same prerogatives as the Patriarch at Constantinople. Each equally derived his principal revenues from the administration of justice and from the sale of ecclesiastical functions, and likewise from collections, made under the name of \" Free Offerings,\" at the episcopal visitation, which usually took place twice a year;3 was equally exempt from the kharadj, and also from the operation of that law by which the Sultan was declared heir to the property of all his subjects, Musulman or Christian, who died childless. The priests were numerously dispersed through the different quarters of Constantinople and in the towns on the Bosphorus, and formed, in conjunction with the monks, or caloyeroi, who inhabited the innumerable mo nasteries of the islands and continent, the inferior order of the Greek clergy. 3 See Waddington's ' Greek Church.'"], [74, "38 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

The constitution of Greek society in the lesser towns and villages was similar to the above ; but, contrary to the state of things at the present day, the inhabitants enjoyed greater comfort and security in proportion to their distance from the capital. The conquering nation, as I have elsewhere stated,4 held the soil by a sort of feudal tenure, akin to that of the middle ages. Wher ever the land had not been converted into vacoufs,5 or transformed into timars and military fiefs, it was generally in the hands of the raiahs, whose condition differed only from that of the Musulman cultivators in being subject to the kharadj. It was not uncommon to find whole cantons and villages occupied by Armenians and Greeks, whilst the Osmanlis, who for the most part disdained agricultural pursuits, followed their beys or sandjaks to the wars. The Armenians were predominant in Anatolia ; the Greeks and Bulgarians in European Turkey. From the moment of the conquest we find the muni cipal system established amongst the latter.

The tenure of office of these magis trates, precursors of the present medjlis, was annual ; and the mode of their election was as simple as that of the parish priests in the times of the primitive church. Once a year, after divine service, the heads of families assembled in the church or under the village tree, and proceeded to the election of their municipal magistrates, one for each village or commune, and three for every town. The principal duty of these officers was to ap portion the tribute imposed in gross to the individual resources of each inhabitant. It was their business to pay into the hands of the collectors or kharadji the amount of the capitation tax ; whether variable, or fixed by composition for a certain number of years. They also controlled other contributions, such as the tithe, and the house-tax, called kapniaticos, or smoke-tax ; and administered the communal fund set apart to indemnify proprietors who had been sufferers by the exactions and 6 The hodja-bachis (chief of the elders), common to both Musulman and Christian villages, were the chiefs of the municipalities, and ac countable to the pasha of the locality for the contributions.

The municipal system, admirably adapted to facilitate the relations of the authorities with the raiahs, was zealously promoted and extended by the Porte : it established a mutual responsibility in each village, rendering every man answerable for his neighbour, and the primate answerable for the whole community. This system, which has prevailed in Walachia and Moldavia up to the present day, has been constantly efficacious in preventing revolt or insurrection under any circumstances, even under the occasional severity of local taxation. Sometimes, however (though such instances were very uncommon), when exaction had become too oppressive for endurance, the whole population of a village has disappeared in a single night, abandoning their habita tions, and leaving not a trace of their footsteps behind.

The latter affairs, however, fell more especially within the province of the priests, who, besides the ordinary functions of religion and public worship, had a civil jurisdiction over their parishioners analogous to that exercised by the bishops in their dioceses ; it was their business to decide all cases which were not of sufficient importance to be brought before the diocesan court. The priests were the pastors and judges of the commune, of which the primates were the stewards and attendants. Belonging to, and forming a part of the people, lodged and fed like them, sharing the same labours, and leading the same life,2 they constituted, notwithstanding their ignorance and avidity, one of the main elements of opposition to the conquest ; and they contributed powerfully to the maintenance of nationality, which the superior clergy of Constantinople, more learned indeed, but corrupt, and slaves of the Divan, were ever tending, though involuntarily, to destroy. III. The condition of the Greeks after the conquest appears, even in the opinion of Montesquieu,3 to have been prefer able to what it was under the Byzantine emperors. In the sequel of their history there is little to develop.

The condition of the Greeks underwent little change until the reign of the Sultan Selim I., the grandsoii of Mohammed II. About sixty years after the conquest, and shortly after the massacre of the sect of the Shiites, this prince, whose cruelties and fanatical zeal for Musulmau orthodoxy had gained him the surname of Yavouz (Inflexible), came to the determination of ridding himself entirely of the Christians, or of forcing them to embrace Islamism. He sent for the Mufti Djemali, and proposed to him the following question : \" Which of the two is the more meritorious, to subjugate the whole world, or to convert nations to Islamism ? \" The Mufti, not suspecting the Sultan's projects, replied that the conversion of infidels was unquestionably the more meritorious and agreeable to God. Selim next summoned the grand-vizir Piri Pasha. \" Too long,\" said the Sultan, \"have these infidel ra'iahs polluted the air with their infectious breath ; let them either embrace the true faith, or disappear from my sight.\" The Vizir, having hi vain endeavoured to dissuade the Sultan from a measure both sanguinary and impolitic, consulted with the Mufti ; and both proceeded to give warning of the danger to the Patriarch Hieremias. with sugges tions as to the course he should adopt.

He quoted, in the first place, certain texts of the Koran, which forbid conversion by violent means, and then proceeded to plead a capitu lation alleged to have been granted to the Greeks by Mohammed II. at the time of the capture, by which it appeared that, while one half of the city was taken by assault, the other half surrendered voluntarily, and opened their gates to the Sultan, on the faith of a treaty accepted and solemnly sworn to by him. The Patriarch affirmed that the original document had been destroyed in a fire, but he was ready to supply its loss by the testimony of three Janissaries, each more than a hundred years of age, who had taken part in the conquest, remembered the transaction, and vouched for the truth of the statement. This story, given at great length by Cantemir, saved the Greek nation.5 The Sultan revoked his sanguinary edict against persons ; but many of the churches were de molished or converted into mosques. Among the latter was the metropolitan church in the quarter of the Blan quernes, which Mohammed had given to the Patriarch Gennadius, as a compensation for that of the Holy Apostles, converted into the mosque of the conqueror himself.

At later periods, indeed, \u2014 in 1640, the last year of the reign of Murad IV.,6 and again in 1770, after the insurrection in the Morea \u2014 the question of exterminating the raiahs was agitated in the Divan. But the principles of equity and the dictates of sound policy prevailed over the alarm and irritation of the moment. The labours of the French missionaries in the Levant commenced with the 17th century. The Lazarists, recently founded by St. Vincent de Paul, established themselves at Constantinople, Salonica, Smyrna. &c, and from thence spread over the rest of the empire.7 \" They began,\" says M. Villemain, \" to build churches and to open schools, whither they attracted many children of the Greek com munion. They occupied themselves both in instructing the Catholics of the Levant, whether natives, travellers, or captives, and in converting the Greeks and Armenians. The liberty that they enjoyed under the protection which the French embassy claimed over all the Eastern Ca tholics, the privileges conceded to them by the Turks, and their efforts to make proselytes, were often the cause of grave schisms among the Christians at Constantinople, and excited great jealousy in the synod, which more than once made accusations against them to the Divan. 6 Or Amurath.

When military ex peditions became less successful, the Porte had recourse to means which came more readily to hand, and in 1656, whether that the government felt the inconvenience of the system, or was inspired with a desire to conciliate the raiahs, this tribute was abolished, and the ranks of the Janissaries were replenished by Asiatic Turks. This impost of blood was particularly odious to the Greeks, inasmuch as it involved the apostasy of their children ; their national ballads abound in instances of mothers who had poniarded their offspring in the very arms of the Turkish commissaries.

Their influence, however, was confined to their own nation, and they appeared to have no other ambition than to live in peaceful obscurity, when destiny unexpectedly called them to fill a prominent and influential position in the Ottoman state. The relations of the Porte with the Western cabinets were becoming daily more numerous and more important, but the Turks, from indolence or prejudice, continued to neglect the study of foreign languages, and persisted in declining to accredit ambas sadors to European courts. Whatever communications they found it necessary to hold with the Franks were carried on through the medium of interpreters, who were either Jews, or Polish or Italian renegades.6 At length, perceiving the many inconveniences which arose from this system of employing foreigners in its confidential affairs, the Porte began to consider whether amongst its own subjects, interpreters might not be found who would more efficiently serve its interests.

It is impossible to give an idea of the ignorance and rudeness that prevailed at this epoch. The Greeks of Asia especially, the earliest victims of the conquest, and the most deeply involved in its influence, were become so rate as to retain scarcely any traces of their ancient origin. It was a miracle that the greater part of them were still Christians. Their very language even seemed in danger of disappearing. Happily there arose from time to time distinguished men, as Cyril, Lucan, and Callinicus, patriarchs of Constantinople, Dositheus patriarch of Jerusalem, Basil of Smyrna, Philaretes of Athens, Meletius, the Archbishop Metrophanes, and Demetrius Cantemir, the greater part of whom wrote in the ancient Greek dialect.8 The same prejudice which in Europe induced the learned to despise the use of the common tongue, and to substitute a barbarous Latinity, reigned in Greece with full force. The elevation, however, of Panayoti and of Alexander Mavrocordato to the important office of dragoman, instituted a new era for Greece. Under their fostering care flourishing col leges arose in many parts of European Turkey and Asia Minor, and the schools of Constantinople and Yanina became particularly celebrated.

Many of these became eminent in their turn, but their names belong more especially to the history of the second period.9 The establishment of these schools (for the most part founded and supported by the Fana riotes) does not appear to have met with any obstacle from the Ottomans, although the Greeks pretend that the fear of awakening the jealous susceptibility of the Porte compelled their founders to disguise them under the name of houses of correction, or to place them under the safeguard of the sanctuary, by converting the vestibules of the churches into schools of primary in struction. But even the very authors who, to enhance the merit of their countrymen, would make us believe in a persecution, or at least in a systematic hostility on the part, of the Turks, furnish us with most striking traite of their tolerance in regard to Christian instruction, of the liberty which they allowed on this point to different communities, of the respect they professed for the monasteries, nearly all converted into schools, and for religious orders to whatever sect they belonged.

A kind of in tellectual fever, like that which marked the revival of letters in France and Germany, seized upon the people. It was a sort of reaction of the West upon the East. The Turks, impelled by the reformatory genius of Selim III., began to depart a little from their ancient routine. Catherine followed with a firm step in the path that Peter had opened. The Greeks, who instinctively fore saw- the struggle approaching between the two empires, greedily listened to each external rumour, and remained in an attitude of vague expectation. IX. In the expedition to the Morea in 1770, we see Russia for the first time openly and directly interfering in the affairs of Greece, but her hidden influence dates from a much earlier period. From the time of Peter the Great a hope of liberty had begun to dawn amongst the Greeks. The commencement of the 18th century beheld the inhabitants of Salonica watching with anxious interest"], [100, "64 LETTERS ON TURKEY. the victories of the Czar of Russia, and speaking of him as their liberator. Peter, availing himself of these sympathies, skilfully directed their tendency to the in terest of himself and his successors. To conquer Byzan tium \u2014to rebuild the Empire of the East, as Charlemagne had rebuilt the Empire of the West \u2014 such an idea had a grandeur which suited well the aspiring genius of the great Czar. At the same time his penetration told him that the hour for action had not yet arrived, but he pointed out the goal, and opened the way to his successors. From this moment commences the influence of Russia upon the Greek population in Turkey \u2014 an influence some times imperceptible, but uniform, systematic, and constant, and for which religion offered the readiest and most efficient medium. The Czar exercised a secret power over the monks of Mount, Athos, and in the synod of Constantinople ; whilst rich presents, costly church orna ments, and printed books, were distributed from Moscow among the convents and bishoprics of Greece ; and these in return sent precious relics, which the Muscovite clergy received with infinite veneration. Even at the present day the system has not undergone much change. If you enter a Greek church or monastery in Turkey, the priest or the abbot who accompanies you soon calls upon you to pause before some candelabrum of massive gold, or some splendid missal richly illuminated and glittering with gems, and informs you with pride that it is the crift of the Emperor of Russia : and if he dared, if he tlid not suspect you of belonging to those schismatics who are worse in his eyes than the very Musulmans themselves, he would further show you one of those"], [101, "Letter I. 65 TREATY OF CONSTANTINOPLE. little catechisms printed at Moscow, in which absolute obedience to the Czar of Russia, and the recognition of him as the head of the orthodox church and the true successor of Constantine, are tenets placed among the articles of the creed. So also, as M. Villemain has informed us in his work on the Greeks already quoted, the Greek priests in the time of Peter the Great mingled the names of the grand dukes of Muscovy with those of the saints of the church. In the year 1720, Peter the Great concluded a treaty with the Porte, in which, for the first time, Russia, after the example of the Catholic powers, stipulates for the protection of the Russian monks and pilgrims to Jerusa lem.1 The 11th article of this treaty, which was con firmed by the same article of the treaty of Belgrade in 1739, is the origin of the protectorate which the Czars at a later period claimed over the Greeks in Turkey. It runs thus :\u2014 \" The merchants of both nations shall enjoy perfect freedom and security in travelling and trafficking between the two countries. The Russians shall make pilgrimages to Jerusalem and other holy places, and they shall not be subject either at Jerusalem or elsewhere to any tribute, karadj, pekasch, nor to any pecuniary exaction whatever for their passports. Russian ecclesiastics remaining in the territories of the Porte shall not be molested.\" How wide is the difference between this modest commence ment, and the exorbitant pretensions which Russia has put forth in our days, and which have so justly alarmed the Treaty of Constantinople, November 5, 1720."], [102, "66 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

It passed as a tradition to his successors. In the reign ofthe Empress Anne (1730-41) emissaries were despatched by Marshal Munich to scatter sold and proclamations with an unsparing hand throughout Epirus and tbe mountains of Thessaly ; for Russia justly relied much more upon raising revolt among the populations of the peninsula where the Klephti and the Armatoli,3 always in arms, preserved the traditions of their race, than amongst the bastard populations of Roumelia and Thrace. A partial insurrection was the consequence, but the Greeks were abandoned to their fate at the peace of 1739.

The Turks, after having in vain tried to subdue them, treated with them, and, at the commence ment of the 10th century, under Selim IL, formed them into a militia, under the name of Armatoli (kpftttruyjii), who were entrusted with the care of the roads and the defence of the country against the rapine of the Albanian Mahometans. According to the imperial Khatti-eherif, Northern Greece was divided into fourteen armatoliks or captaincies, the commandants of which obeyed the pashas, and in some places the Greek primates. Those who would not accept this military bondage continued to live in their mountains, and preserved their former names of Klephti, which in the original language signifies robbers. \u2014 T."], [103, "67 Letter I. INSURRECTION IN THE MOREA. Elizabeth (1741-62) new emissaries appeared in the mountains of Taygetus, the country of the Mainotes, and spread rumours of war and of approaching emancipation. A popular tradition had taught the Hellenes that \" their deliverance would be accomplished by a fair-haired nation from the north, named Ros,\" and they naturally beheld in the Russians the predicted people. But rumour and conjecture seldom took a definite form. It was by vague reports, repeated in a mysterious tone, by whispered pro phecies, and by dim allusions \u2014 clothed in that mystic language which some years later mainly contributed to the supcess of the Hetairia, and which is so much the delight of the Sclavonic races that it occurs even in their official documents \u2014 that the multitude were worked upon, till at length these floating rumours became mingled in the religious belief of the country. The traveller Chandler, who visited the Morea a few years later, when the Empress Catherine was seated on the Russian throne, relates that wherever he went he heard it continually announced that the Russians would soon arrive to effect the emancipation of the Greeks. He mentions a story that was current of a luminous cross having appeared above the dome of St. Sophia, and that the Turks, having attempted in vain to banish the mira culous sisrn, had been thrown into the utmost consterna tion by their failure. The insurrection of 1770 was the result of these in trigues. It is difficult to say whether this event and its consequences were more calamitous to the Greeks or disgraceful to the Russians.

Gregory Papadopoulos, or Papasoghlou, a native of Larissa, and an officer in the Imperial Guard of Russia, appears to have been the first instigator of the insurrec tion. He communicated his plans to Orloff, the favourite of Catherine, who embraced the project with ardour, aud interested the Empress herself in its favour. They openly spoke of driving the Turks out of Europe, and establish ing Greece into an independent state, though how or when this was to take place they did not state. The real object, however, was the annexation of the Crimea to the Russian empire, but Papadopoulos and another Russian emissary named Tamara set out to raise a revolt in Greece.

They were true to their word. In the month of April, 1770, the Russian fleet, commanded by Admiral Spiritoff, appeared in the bay of \u00c6tylos, and the insurrection burst forth like flame from one extremity of the Morea to the other.

Above fifty thousand Greeks were put to the sword, whilst the Russians from their vessels quietly be held the conflagration of towns and villages and the massacre of the wretched inhabitants.0 They soon set sail from the coasts of Greece to join the flotilla of Admiral Elphinstone, which had been despatched to re inforce the squadron of Spiritoff. The Turkish fleet was destroyed at Tchesme (July 7, 1770), but Russia made no further effort to support the unhappy nation which had been induced to rely on her. Spiritoff, after passing a disastrous winter at Paros, collected the broken remains of his squadron and returned home ; and so, for the present, vanished the hopes of the Greeks.

When their work was finished they demanded their pay, and when the money was not forthcoming, they disbanded, according to their usual practice, and pillaged the country. They laid waste the villages, and, driving the inhabitants before them like cattle, regained the defiles of their native mountains. Some, however, remained in the Morea, where, instal ling themselves into the houses and lands of the Greek Qtry, they deprived the soil of its husbandmen and the Turks of their subjects, till at length, finding no more ra'iahs to plunder, they turned their violence against the Musulmans themselves, and treated as van quished those they had come to defend.

Though it contained some stipu lations favourable to the Greeks, it appeared to have been dictated less by a spirit of justice and a desire of repair ing their wrongs, than by the desire of Russia to preserve a right over those very people whose cause she had aban doned.

Still the treaty of Ka'inardji, by giving Russia the free navigation of the Black Sea, and the power of appointing consuls and vice-consuls in the seaports of the Levant,8 became a source of advantage and prosperity to the Greeks. The consular agents were generally selected from among the natives of the place to which they were appointed ; and they profited by the opportunity thus afforded of carrying on their commerce under the pro tection of the immunities which their Berdts 9 secured to them. But as the privilege of the Berat was not restricted to the person of the consul or consular agent, but extended to all the functionaries, and even to the servants of his house ; and moreover as a certain number of Berats were placed at the disposal of each embassy, and could be purchased on application for three or four thousand piastres, a vast number of Greek traders availed themselves of these facilities to equip merchant vessels, ' Treaty of Ka'inardji, Art.

By degrees, and in spite of recent experience, the latter accustomed themselves to regard their destinies as bound up with those of the empire of the Czars. Their active and enterprising genius launched them with ardour in the new career opened to them. In a few years the Euxine and the White Sea,' both of which had long been looked upon as Ottoman lakes, were covered with trading vessels from the Greek islands of the Archipelago and the Ionian Sea, carrying on a profitable commerce with all the ports of the Mediterranean. Three small islands, Hydra, Spezzia, and Ipsara, which had been only known to mariners as rocks, were foremost in con tributing to the rapid rise of the Greek navy. Instead of the speroneras, or barks with lateen sails, that hitherto had sufficed for all the trade between the islands, large vessels were built to navigate the whole extent of the Mediterranean, from Kherson and Taganrok to Gibraltar. Some even extended their voyages to America. These were in general well armed, and capable of defying the attacks and pursuit of the formidable pirates of Algiers.

The town of Odessa, recently built on a steppe of Tartary, and chiefly inhabited by Greeks, rose quickly to the first rank in commercial importance. In 1816 the number of vessels belonging to the Christian subjects of the Porte, fitted out in the ports and islands of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece, amounted to 600, employing 17,000 sailors, and armed with 6000 pieces of cannon.

Hussein Pasha, the High Admiral, also used all his influence to support it. with the two-fold object of diminishing the growing sway of Russia, and of training up sailors for the Turkish navv, which he was labouring to regenerate.

In him we mark the point where political action joins the literary movement, and with him we enter into this new phase ; and events, which twenty-five years later brought about the deliverance of Greece, already begin to \" cast their shadows before.\" Rhigas was the precursor of Greek independence and the first martyr in its cause. He was born at Yelestina a small town of Thessaly, in 1753 or 1755. Fie came eajly to Bucharest, where he addicted himself to commerce, the sole path to fortune and independence for a Greek of that period. In 1790, at the moment when the French revo lution broke out, we find him a professor in the college of Bucharest. From his youth he had mingled a passion for study and letters with the duties of his business ; poetry and comparative geography especially attracted him : but there was another passion which still more strongly possessed his heart, and that was the love of his beautiful and unfortunate country. He dreamed only of its liberation. With this view he organised an associa tion, of which he became the soul and the chief, having for its object to prepare the minds of the people for a new effort in favour of emancipation. This association was the germ out of which the Hetairia afterwards grew. The Society founded by Rhigas included nearly all the en lightened and influential men of the nation. Some few"], [113, "Letter I. RHIGAS. 77 foreigners were admitted, but Rhigas wished to depend for the deliverance of Greece upon Greeks alone. Above all, he carefully concealed his designs from Russia, though he did not refuse to open secret negotiations with Pasvan Ogiou, the famous rebel chief of Servia,4 who for several years had held the armie? of the Porte in check. In 1796 Rhigas repaired to Vienna, to mature his enterprise and to prepare for its execution. From thence he corresponded with the members of the Hetairia, who were dispersed through different parts of Greece, and with the autho rities of the French Directory. He there edited a Greek Journal for the instruction of his fellow-countrymen, and priuted his translation of Le Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis. He also constructed a map of Greece and had it engraved on a large scale, with the names of places in Romaic, which he probably intended to serve as a basis of operation for the Hetairists.-' At the same time his Odes and songs, written likewise in Romaic, the language of the people, and inspired by the fervour of his patriotism, aroused in the hearts of all an enthusiasm for liberty and for their country.

The Turks themselves, captivated by the masculine vigour of these melodies, often demanded to have them sung, little imaoining- the meaning of the sounds which delighted them. In fact the moment approached, and the Greek nation, ready to spring to arms, only awaited the signal, when Rhigas was arrested at Trieste, with eight of his companions, as he was about to embark for the Peloponnesus, and deli vered over by the Austrian police into the hands of the Turks, who put him to death at Belgrade (May, 1798), and threw his corpse into the Danube. All the journals of Europe resounded with this catastrophe. Some weeks afterwards, Anthimos, Patriarch of Jerusalem, published with the sanction, and probably at the instance of the Porte, a sort of mandate addressed to the Greeks of Turkey, and intended to retain them in their faith and obedience.

But the exertions of Rhigas were not lost : whilst the Hetairists were reconstructing their society on a new basis, a revolution was taking place in the studies and teaching of the nation. The Greeks who had chosen literature as their career, no longer devoted them selves to learning for its own sake. They no longer re garded antiquity from an abstract and speculative point of view, but sought for its positive and practical bearings. When commenting on Demosthenes or Xenophon to their pupils, they pointed rather to the patriotism of the statesman or the general than to the Attic graces of the writer, or the matchless eloquence of the orator. They sought after the spirit that had animated the historians of ancient Greece, and no longer demanded of these the secrets of their art, but serious and useful lessons of life. The ambition of restoring their language to its purity was no longer their sole purpose. The idea of restoring their country equally engrossed them, and they bent over the remains of departed Greece in the hope of beholding her resurrection to a living existence. Amongst these illustrious men we may cite the names of Lambros Photiadis of Yanina, professor of belles lettres in the college of Bucharest (1795), his pupil Neophytes Doukas of Epirus, and Veniamin (*'. e.

It was situated amidst olive groves on a gentle slope descending to the sea-shore.

Through the good offices of Sarus Petraki, a rich Greek banker, all powerful at the Seraglio, he obtained a ferman for the removal of all the Turkish inhabitants from Aivali ; another ferman, similarly obtained, erected the place which now took the name of Kydonia, into an independent municipality, enjoying the right of administering its own affairs, and subject only to the general superintendence of the Turkish governor, and customs officers of the district.

His description acquired a greater interest, as it preceded by a very few years only the sad catastrophe which involved the whole in ruin.

Coray was born at Smyrna in 1748. He was of Elian descent, and rly youth was passed in commercial pursuits. In the year 1782. being then thirty-four years of age, he determined to exchange commerce for medicine, and set out to pursue his studies at Montpellier ; thence, after a time, he removed to Paris, where he continued to reside until his death in 1833. Through France and her language Coray first became known to his country. When he published in 1799 his translation of Theophrastes, followed shortly by that of the Treatise of Hippocrates, ' Concerning Water, &c.,' Greece had not heard of his name, and she little dreamed that one of her own sons was earning prizes from the Institute of France, and a reputation which was shortly to become European. His translation into Modern Greek (Romaic) of ' Bec caria's Treatise on Crimes and Punishments' (1802), which he dedicated to the young Republic of the Ionian Islands, was the first work that attracted the notice of his country men. The style of the dedication, and the notes and other matter which he added to the text, left no doubt of the views of the writer, and conferred on his work almost the character of a political event. \" It was the first time,\" observes a contemporary Greek author, \" that the Christian \u2022' powers of the West had displayed any interest in the \" cause of enslaved Greece. By the constitution of the \" Ionian Republic they had bestowed on a small part of \" her territory the shadow at least of a political existence, \" and encouraged hopes in the remainder of the nation."], [120, "Letter I. 84 LETTERS ON TURKEY. \" The Septinsular state rose on the ardent imagination of \" the Greeks, like a new constellation of Pleiades, pre \" saging a brilliant future for the entire nation.\" Under such circumstances, the translation of ' Beccaria ' circu lated rapidly, and made a vivid impression on the minds of its eager readers. The following year, 1803, Coray published a pamphlet entitled ' The Present State of Civilization in Greece,' wherein he pointed out the awakening of the nation, and fully evinced himself to the world as a publicist and a patriot. From this period his political aud literary works followed each other with uninterrupted rapidity. In 1804 he published his edition of ' Heliodorus,' followed by his French translation of the ' Geography of Strabo,' the joint work of himself and Laporte-Dutheil. Next appeared his fine edition of the ' Hellenic Library ' (17 vols. in 8vo., 1807-1825), printed at the expense of the brothers Zosimados,5 comprising Isocrates, Plutarch, Strabo, the Polities and Ethics of Aristotle, Esop, the different Histories of \u00c6lian, the Fragments of Heraclides, and Nicolas Daniascenus, &c. He at the same time engaged, with the co-operation of several of his learned countrymen, to compile a complete Lexicon in modern Greek and French. The prince Demetrius Morousi took upon himself the expense of ex ecuting this great work, which was too soon interrupted by the outbreak of the insurrection ; \" still, however, 5 The brothers Zosimados were wealthy Greek merchants of Leghorn, who had sent Coray to Paris, and maintained him there for the express purpose of elucidating the ancient, and adding to the modern literature of his countrymen. 6 The printing of this Lexicon was commenced in 1817, in the printing office of the Patriarch of Constantinople.

Coray perceived the danger to which his national language was exposed, of becoming on the one hand pe dantic and ridiculous, by the senseless engrafting of ancient Hellenisms on the corrupt and motley jargon of the day \u2014 a system of pretended improvement, adopted aud de fended by some writers, and well characterised by others as the mixto-barbaros ; on the other, of totally disap pearing under the rude dialect in common use, called \" Romaic,\" and which had its advocates, as Christopoulos and Katarghi,7 who defended it under the plea of its being the daily language of the people. Coray therefore em ployed all his efforts, in the first place, to discard the foreign words and idioms, which during ages of barbarism aud neglect had crept in from all the languages of Europe, but chiefly from the Italian and the Turkish, and to re place them by terms derived from the ancient Greek ; in the next place, to purify and regenerate the popular idiom, by restoring to it, as far as possible, the grammatical forms and construction of the ancient language.

The Hetairia,8 of which the foundations had been laid by the unfortunate Rhigas, was revived and re organised. A new society had been formed in Vienna during the sitting of the Congress, towards the latter end of 1814 It adopted the appellation of Philo-musai, and professed that its object was to give an extended education to Greece, by increasing the number of schools. The Greeks began to excite interest in diplomatic circles and conferences, whilst Turkey, which had neglected to send an envoy to the Congress, came to be looked upon as quite out of the pale of civilised Europe. The Ionian republic, now placed under the Protectorate of England, after having been protected in turn by France and Russia, had been the means of directing the attention of the Western Cabinets towards the Greek Peninsula, and the far-famed discussions between Catherine and Joseph II. during the journey to the Crimea, were renewed by their descendants Alexander and Francis II. The Philo-musai meantime pursued their course, declaring that they occu pied themselves with the moral and intellectual, not the political emancipation of Greece, whilst their adoption of the solemn and unwarlike Bird of Minerva for their emblem seemed an assurance to the world that the cultivation of 6 See page o&} note, and page 73,"], [123, "Letter I. 87 THE PHILO-MUSAI. learning and the diffusion of wisdom were to be their sole aim and occupation. Count John Capo d'lstrias, a Corfiotc, in the service of Russia, was at the head of the association of the Philo-musai, which soon included among its mem bers all that was distinguished in the Greek nation, and most of the persons throughout Europe who were illustrious either in science, art, or politics. The Emperor Alexander sought the honour of appearing as patron of the Philo musai, and many of the other sovereigns present at the Congress of Vienna followed his example. Thus marvel lously are the wills and passions of mankind overruled by Providence, and made, unconsciously to themselves, the very instruments of working out changes and events to which they are the most opposed. One ofthe principal members of the society was Coray, who, notwithstanding his great age, and an absence of thirty years from his native land, passed his nights and days in the service of his countrymen ; labouring by his writings to render them increasingly worthy of the liberty they were preparing to seize. He wrought assiduously in the establishment of schools, which he directed from the depth of his retreat in a distant country as judiciously as though he had been at Athens or Constantinople. The principal Greek colleges were those of Kydonia (lately mentioned), of Chios, which might have challenged com parison with the most celebrated institutions of learning in Europe, of Patmos, of Korou-tschesme on the Bosphorus, founded in 1799 by the exertions of Prince Demetrio Morousi, of Bucharest, Jassy, Yanina, Athens, and Corfu, where Lord Guildford, in 1823, founded a university, the first that had been seen in Greece.

Another at Trieste, though of more recent date, shared in the rising prosperity of that city, und boasted among its professors \u00c6sopius, one of the most accomplished writers in the Hellenic language. Leghorn had also its college, founded and supported by the funds ofthe wealthy Greek merchants, who constituted a large proportion of its commercial aristocracy. At Vienna the Greeks had long possessed several printing establishments, and there they published two journals, the 'Hellenic Telegraph' and the ' Hermes Logios,' both extensively circulated in the nation. The city of Odessa, equally devoted to pleasure and commerce, contained both a college and a theatre, where tragedies in the modern Greek language were very tolerably per formed. Theatres likewise existed at Bucharest, Jassy, and Corfu. Literature was daily extending : during the first twenty years of the present century above three thousand works, either original or translations into modern Greek, issued from the various presses of Con stantinople, Jassy, Vienna, Leipsic, Venice, Paris, and Moscow. A new work was no sooner announced in pro spectus than subscribers pressed forwaid to defray the cost of publication ; whilst main of the wealthy merchants, who were members of the Philo-musai, caused the best works in the ancient and modern languages to be printed at their own expense, aud gratuitously distributed among the schools.

This political offshoot of a literary stock adopted the title of 'Eraipla -run (pikixxn, Society of Friends, and the symbol of a Ph\u0153nix rising from its ashes.9 Impatient for the accomplishment of its objects, this new society was manifestly preparing to hurry forward events rather than patiently await their gradual development by time and opportunity. XV. The origin and earlier movements of the Hetairia, for the most part imperfectly understood, have been the subject of numerous versions and conjectures, varying and often contradictory. At the present day its true history is better known, and the following data may be found interesting.1 About the end of 1815, and a year after the formation of the Philo-musai association, four individuals, Greeks of obscure birth, happened to meet at Moscow. Their names were Nicolas Skouphas, Athanasius Zacalof, Atha nasius Sekenis, and Anagnostopoulos : \u2014 the three last natives of the Morea ; the first of Epirus, a man without education, but of considerable experience in the affairs of 9 Taken from the armorial bearings of the Mavrocordato family. 1 For an account of the original proceedings of the Hetairia, sec ' The History of the Greek Insurrection,' by M.

They were all ev in commerce, their commercial affairs had brought them to Russia, and being all acquainted with Alexander Mav rocordato, ex-Hospodar of Walachia, they were accustomed to meet frequently at his house. In the course of these meetings, Nicolas Skouphas suggested the idea of resuming the project of Rhigas, for the emancipation of Greece by means of an extensive and secret association, devoting itself to find funds for the furnishing of soldiers and sup plies to the insurrection. His companions embraced the project with ardour. The whole of the winter, and fol lowing spring, were passed in arranging their places of operation. Meanwhile Skouphas died, and was replaced by an Ionian named Galati, whose rashness and indis cretion were more than once on the point of ruining the whole affair. At length, having agreed upon their course, and bound themselves mutually by the most solemn oaths, they separated. One remained in Russia, the other three proceeded to visit Turkey and Greece. Wherever they went they gave themselves out as the secret agents of some invisible power, which was to interfere at a destined moment for the liberation of Greece. But whence that power, or what would be the time for its action, they carefully avoided to declare ; assuming airs of mysterious reserve, as though they were themselves but partially initiated into the secret, or that a single word incautiously pronounced might fatally compromise the whole under taking. This nameless power they chose to designate as the Ap%rj,2 or \" First principle,\" a term borrowed from 2 It is difficult to find an English word that will adequately render aPX*> ' arche ;' it means the beginning, the first principle, the alj"], [127, "Letter I.

Its very vagueness, however, acted all the more powerfully on the imaginations to which it was ad- dressed : the unknown has no limits and cannot be defined, therefore the Alpha, thus dimly shadowed forth and shrouded in mystery and distance, was well adapted to elude the questioning of the sceptic, and to acquire sacred and sublime proportions in the imagination of the enthusiast Some dreamed of a coalition of the Christian powers of Europe advancing to the rescue ; and the encou- ragement which the potentates assembled at Vienna had openly bestowed on the Philo-musai gave strength to such rumours ; others whispered the name of Russia alone. Certain it is that the four missionaries of the Hetairia found no difficulty in obtaining both partisans and money. It will be remembered that the first years of the Bourbon Restoration, from 1815 to 1820, witnessed an extraordinary agitation and propagandism of liberal ideas throughout Europe. In France, Italy, Germany, England, societies of various kinds sprung up or increased ; some professing social, some religious, some political objects, more or less openly avowed, but all evincing the restless desire for emancipation and the impatience for a new state of things which was fermenting below the surface. The Hetairia belonged to the political category, and was, in some respects, akin to the Carbonari of Italy. To attain the first rank of the Hetairia it was necessary to pass through seven previous degrees of initiation ; but it was not neces sary to be thus far advanced, in order to learn that the essential object of the association was warfare against the"], [128, "Letter I. 92 LETTERS ON* TURKEY. Turks;3 this article of the creed became evident on the very threshold The real strength and resources of the Hetairia were known only to the most deeply initiated adepts who composed the secret committee, and who were very few in number : no restrictions, however, checked the number of the ordinary members, and these, in the be ginning of 1820, were computed to exceed 200,000. The multitude of the affiliated, and the indiscriminate and often careless manner of their admission, had become a serious danger to the society. To restrain the impatience and imprudent sallies of so large and heterogeneous a mass was no longer possible, especially as the original strictness of the rules had, in course of time, become relaxed. Every day threatened discovery and ruin. The appointment of a visible and efficient chief to replace the visionary \" Arche \" seemed imperative, and this post of honour was offered, in the first instance, to Count Capo dTstrias : he declined it, and the Hetairists then placed Alexander Hypsilantis at their head. XVI. Hypsilantis was at this time about twenty-eight or twenty-nine years of age. His family, originally of Tre bisond, was reckoned amongst the noblest of the Fanar; and his father, Constantine, had been successively Hos podar of Moldavia (1799) and of Walachia (1802). 3 'History of the Hellenic Revolution,' by Spiridione Tricoupi, in modern Greek, London, 1853, referred to in page 89 (see note also a review of this work inserted in ' L' Atheneum Fran9ais ' of the 3rd December, 1853."], [129, "Letter I. ALEXANDER HYPSII. \\ 93 After the peace of Tilsit, he emigrated with his family to Russia, where Alexander, his eldest son, entered the army and rapidly attained the higher ranks. He lost his right hand at the battle of Dresden, and at the period of which we speak he was a major-general in the Russian service and aide-de-camp to the Emperor of Russia. He is described as possessing more daring than true courage ; more ardour of imagination than strength of character : prone to generous impulses, but destitute of real greatness of mind, his ambition to become the liberator of his country was inspired rather by the desire of acting a brilliant part than by the self-sacrificing devotion of true patriotism : he largely shared the vanity and intriguing spirit common to his countrymen of the Fanar ; an overweening confi dence in himself, together with a presumptuous under valuing of others, rendered him apt to rush headlong into the most hazardous undertakings, without the qualities necessary to ensure success. Such was Alexander Hypsi lantis. and with him commences the revolutionary phase of the Hetairia. The circumstances of the moment seemed to favour the designs of that association. The Sultan Mahmoud was engaged in an obstinate struggle with the great feudal chiefs of his empire. The famous Ali of Tepeleni, pasha of Yanina, who had been outlawed by the Porte, March 1820, was rousing the Greek ra'iahs on all sides to arms and liberty, trusting, by their revolt, to strengthen his own position against his sovereign the Sultan.

The Danubian Principalities, excited by the Hetairists of Bessarabia, and sympathising with Hypsilantis, seemed awaiting but the signal to rise ; and the whole Turkish empire, enfeebled within and attacked from without, appeared tottering to its downfall. The Hetairists further persuaded themselves that they had nothing to dread from the interference of the European Cabinets, but that, on the contrary, they might rather hope for support. Russia covertly favoured the designs of the Hetairia; Austria would probably countenance a revolt in Servia, in the hope of ultimately annexing that province to her own dominions ; England might be ex pected to view with satisfaction the establishment of a State on the west of Turkey which should form, under her protection, a counterpoise to the Provinces of the Danube, already almost in the grasp of Russia ; while France, notwithstanding her ancient alliance with the Porte, would be irresistibly drawn on to espouse the cause of Greek emancipation, by the same spirit of chivalrous enthusiasm which had led her, forty years before, to unsheath the sword against England on behalf of the independence of the United States of America. Such were the calcula tions, or such rather were the dreams, which occupied the Hetairists, when, in February, 1821, Alexander Hypsilantis (who had been for some time leading a retired life in the bosom of his family) suddenly quitted his residence at Odessa aud -appeared at Jassy, the capital of Moldavia only a few leagues distant from the Turkish frontier.

Michael Soutzo, who had been secretly prepared to expect him, he was received with open arms. The conspirators had neither arranged their plans nor organised an army ; but tlypsilantis had provided himself with a great store of proclamations and manifestoes, which he dispersed in all directions, and by the soul-stirring eloquence of these he hoped soon to raise the whole country. In the mean time the masters of sixty merchant vessels that happened to be in the harbour of Galatz were massacred, and all the Mahometan inhabitants of the town shared the same fate. On the 5th April Flypsilantis left Jassy for Bucharest, spreading on his way reports that forty thousand Russian troops were marching to support the insurrection. The Greeks also who had fled from Constantinople affirmed that a vast conspiracy, which would place the capital of the empire in their hands, was on the point of breaking out there. In spite, however, of all these efforts, the Hetairists met with no cordial response from either the nobles or the peasants of Moldo-Wallachia, whose natural apathy and instinctive distrust of Russia, and perhaps also their want of confidence in an enterprise, apparently so crude and ill combined, rendered them apprehensive of compro mising themselves by declaring in favour of Hypsilantis. The true character of his enterprise, at first doubtful, soon became manifest. Four days after his departure from Jassy, the Russian consul at that place issued a formal pro test, against the proceedings of the Hetairists, disavowing, in the name of his government, all connexion with them. On the following day the Hospodar, Michael Soutzo, was compelled by the Moldavian boyars to quit his capital :"], [132, "Letter I. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 96 he immediately, with his family, sought refuge in Bessa rabia.\" The protest of the Russian consul was followed by an ukase of the Emperor, depriving Hypsilantis of his rank in the army ; and at the same time the minister of Russia at Constantinople, the Baron de Strogonoff, com municated to the Divan the resolution of his government to observe a strict neutrality, and to maintain the treaties existing between the two powers. The Austrian minister supported this declaration by a note drawn up in similar terms. This reserve of the cabinets was in some measure necessary to their position. The sovereigns of the Holy Alliance, being at that moment assembled in congress at Laybach, deliberating on the expediency of setting aside the constitutional system established at Naples by the insurrection there in 1820, could scarcely contradict their own principles by contemporaneously supporting insurrec tion on the Danube. Some years later, it is true, they did depart from these principles and favi >ur the Greeks ; but the Greek struggle for independence was the triumph of opinion, not of policy. In the present conjuncture Russia was true to her old system of abandoning those she had compromised, the moment, their cause seemed lost. She repeated the part she had played in the Morea in 1770, and still more recently in Servia in 1818, where she first encouraged and then disavowed the attempt of Czerny- Georgy.5 4 Some time after, the ex-Hospodar, desirous of exchanging this asylum for one in Italy, was arrested on his passage through Austria, and im prisoned at Goritz, where he languished for some years.

Moldo-Wala chia began to show symptoms of agitation, but not in favour of the Hetairists. Theodore Vladimiresco had unfurled the national banner in Lesser Walachia ; but it was to negociate with the Porte by offering to join it in driving out the Greeks on condition that Roumania should be restored to its ancient freedom and to the government of its native princes. The Greek army of liberation, as it pompously styled itself, consisted merely of a handful of Albanians drawn together by the hope of plunder, and the Sacred battalion of Hypsilantis formed of the elite of the Greek youth. The cause indeed was lost, but Hypsi lantis had advanced too far to retreat. He kept the field for two months longer, till the unfortunate battle of Dra gachan, fought on the 19th June, compelled him to seek refuge in the Austrian territory : there he was speedily arrested and imprisoned in the Hungarian fortress of Mongatz. He was liberated at the end of some years, and retired to Vienna, where he died on the 20th of July, 1828, at the age of thirty-eight. XVII. During this interval important events had been taking place both in Greece and at Constantinople. A vague uneasiness pervaded the capital. The people were agi tated by rumours of plots and conspiracies ; the Greeks it was said were about to seize on the Tophaneh and the Arsenal, whilst a Russian squadron was at the same time to enter the Bosphorus and to bombard the city.

The Greeks addressed one another with a mysterious air ; whilst the Turks regarded them with gloomy and threatening looks, and loudly accused the Sultan, whose sacrilegious clemency, they said, permitted these enemies of the empire and the faith to live ; and incendiary fires, the never-failing sign of popular discon tent at Constantinople, nightly burst forth in various quarters of the city. Thus the year 1820 closed amidst general apprehension and mutual mistrust. Nothing certain, however, had as yet transpired respecting the plot which was preparing in Moldavia, until John Callimachi, the chief dragoman of the Porte, secretly informed of the conspirations of the Hetairists, denounced the conspiracy to the most influ ential, though not the jtrincipal, of Mahmoud's minis ters, Khalet-Effendi. This favourite was then at the height of his power. Whilst the Stdtan, according to established custom, lived retired in the recesses of the seraglio, Khalet, who was \" Nichandji \" 6 or keeper of the privy seal, was the soul of the government. He made and deposed grand-vizirs at his pleasure ; the divan trembled before him, and even the ambassadors of foreign powers were desirous to secure his good graces.

Neither that circumstance nor the continual advancement of his fortune had been able to overcome in him the an- cient instincts and prejudices of the dervish. His fana- ticism, however, rendered him only more popular with the multitude.

Callimachi having re- vealed his grounds of apprehension, Khalet affected to treat them as chimerical, and the chief dragoman still insisting on the incontestable evidence of the designs of the Hetairists and the treason of Michael Soutzo, Khalet flew into a rage, deprived Callimachi of his employment (which was bestowed on Constantine Morousi), and banished him to Kaisarie.7 It is possible that Khalet did 7 C\u00e6sarea, in Cappadocia. f2"], [136, "100 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

Fresh intelligence, however, soon rendered all incre- dulity on the subject of the approaching rebellion in the principalities impossible. Prince Charles Callimachi, brother of the lately dismissed dragoman (and successor as Hospodar of Walachia to the old Prince Alexander Soutzo), arrived at Constantinople. Khalet beheld his arrival with ill-dissembled uneasiness, and pretended to consult Callimachi, as though uncertain what course to adopt.

Whilst he was still hesitating, the official ac- count of Hypsilanti's invasion of the principalities reached Constantinople.

Such a manifesto in the present conjuncture, by sub stantiating the indistinct apprehensions that had lately prevailed, brought popular effervescence to a crisis ; and the ferment was still increased by the tidings which simultaneously reached Constantinople of the insurrection having broken out in the Morea. The popular fury against the Christians, and particularly against the Greeks, became uncontrollable, and the Divan, placed between two perils, terrified on the one hand by the violence -of its Musulman subjects, and distracted on the other by the menaces of insurrection, which seemed to burst, forth on all sides, perceived no safety but in the destruction of those it dreaded.

This letter, which was con veyed to him through the medium of the Russian ambas sador at the Porte, he placed before the divan ; and it added to the terrors of a position where all seemed peril, bv creating- fresh distrust and terror. A new khatti-sherif was issued, calling on all faithful Musulmans, from seven to sixty years of age, to take up arms in defence of their country.

Massacres, the de struction of churches, and outrages of every sort ensued throughout Thrace, Macedonia, and Asia Minor. The brothers John and Charles Callimachi were beheaded, one at C\u00e6sarea, the other at Boli, their respective places of banishment, and during two months a complete reign of terror prevailed. Europe received the tidings of these cruelties with a universal shout of horror and indignation. In vain did the Porte endeavour to justify its course by the plea of necessity, and by citing the conduct of the Greeks in other places, especially on a recent occasion, when the Mollah of Mecca had been seized by them, as he was peaceably and unsuspectingly pursuing his voyage to Constantinople, and, with ail his family, had been sub jected to the most frightful atrocities. But the hour had not arrived for the Osmanlis to obtain an impartial hearing.

Unfortunately the Divan, deceived and bewildered by the intrigues of Khalet-Effendi, struck blindly on all sides, and destroyed the innocent along with, and some times instead of, the guilty. The few who had really been in league with Hypsilantis had timely secured their own safety by quitting Constantinople before the news of his revolt could arrive there, and had either joined his standard or taken refuge in the Morea. The patriarch Gregorius, the chief dragoman Constantine Morousi, the metropolitan Cyril, and many others who had been put to death, were innocent of all co-operation in the attempt for which they suffered as victims. But terror strikes and does not reason, and a populace, once excited by the sight of blood, becomes hke a wild beast urged on by a mad desire for more. Khalet-Effendi did not long enjoy the triumph of his intrigues.

Confirmed by this sight in the cer tainty of his recall, he advanced to meet the messenger, and received an order to prepare for death. He was strangled on the spot, and his head, bearing the accusatory yafta, was exposed in the accustomed place at Constan tinople. So fell Khalet-Effendi, after having exercised, during twelve years, an authority almost unbounded over his sovereign and the Ottoman Empire. XVIII. Events in Greece had, in the interim, begun to assume an alarming aspect for Turkey. The designs of the Hetairists, defeated at Constantinople and on the Danube, seemed likely to triumph in the Morea. The Morea, indeed, was their proper scene of action, for there only could an armed resistance to the Ottoman power be efficiently organised, and there only could the sympathies of Europe become sincerely enlisted in the Hellenic cause. The heroes of Constantinople and the Danube were unknown to western nations, and their names sounded strangely in western cars ; but in the Peloponnesus each step revived some classic recollection ; and the appella tions still familiarly heard there in common life were the same that had stirred our earliest enthusiasm and com manded our youthful reverence.4 The first signal of revolt was given from Calamata, a small town of Maina, in the south of the Morea, and the c iades, Epaminondas, Aristides, Socrates, Plato, are as fre - bestowed by the modern Greeks on their children as the de ma of John, Theodore, Peter, and Paul. \u2014 T."], [143, "Letter I.

Even those who were inclined to cling with most tenacity to the old erro neous system, began to comprehend that Turkey must in future seek for strength and safety not in war and exclu sion, but in prudent reforms and judicious concessions ; such as in progress of time might overcome the antagon ism of races and religion, and produce amalgamation and unity. The defeat of Navarino had, however, nearly occa sioned the destruction of the Christian subjects of Turkey ; for on learning that disastrous affair the Sultan Mahmoud for an instant entertained the idea of commanding a general extermination, by way of reprisal for what he con sidered \u2014 perhaps justly considered \u2014 a violation of the law of nations.

On other occasions he had been heard to utter these noble words : \" I henceforth recognise the Musulman only in his mosque, the Christian only in his church, the Jew only in his synagogue.\" Language so new from the lips of an Ottoman sovereign, and these striking acts of liberality and toleration, were not dic- tated to Mahmoud merely by a sagacious view of his position and by the evident necessity of attaching to himself the Christian population of his dominions: they had also their source in his secret jealousy of Mehemet Ali, the Pasha of Egypt, and in a desire to surpass in liberalism an insolent vassal whom he could not conquer in the field, and whom Europe, in its infatuation, affected to oppose to him in everything as a sovereign and a reformer. However, the liberal policy of Mahmoud, whatever its motives, was not long in bearing fruits. When Greece was established as an independent kingdom, it had beeu expected, naturally, that the Greek subjects of Turkey would flock in numbers to the new state in order to partake the blessings of its free government, and to unite themselves to their compatriots in religion, race, and language. Strange to say, however, the emigratiou, as we have elsewhere stated,5 took a contrary direction : and from the years 1834 to 1836, the Turkish provinces bordering on the Hellenic frontier received several thou sand Greek emigrants, driven from their own country by internal troubles and divisions, iu&cparable perhaps from a newly-founded state. 5 See Introduction, page 18."], [149, "Letter I.

The schism of the Greek and Latin Churches, as Gibbon remarks, followed close upon the restoration of the Western Empire by Charlemagne. Originating in the antipathy which the subjects of the old and new Rome felt for each other ever since the time of Constan tine, this schism began in the ninth century, through the ambitious intrigues of Photius, Patriarch of Constan tinople, and was consummated by his successor, Michael Cerularius, in 1054.

Greek priests were in the habit of purifying altars at which a Latin had officiated ; fanatical monks were incessant in their denunciations of the union, and in preaching the extermination of those they termed schismatics; and the patriarchs themselves in their writings excited the people against the latter.

The schism of the Nestorian Church, introduced by Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, in 428, is also based upon two essential differences ; its followers hold ing that there are two natures and two persons in Jesus Christ and that the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son.

The Orthodox Church, from the time of its separation from Rome, had continued to recognise four patriarchs in conformity with the decisions of the council of Chalcedon in 451, viz. those of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. Although these four seats were con sidered equal in principle, the supremacy was ensured to that of Constantinople by the presence of the imperial court, and subsequently by the privileges conceded to Gennadius and his successors by the khatti-sherif of Mohammed II. From a passage in the Turco-Gr\u00e6cia6 we find that at the close of the sixteenth century the Patriarch of Constantinople exercised his jurisdiction over all Christians of the oriental rite. He was recognised as the sole (Ecumenic by the three Patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, who nevertheless gave him the title of brother and colleague. He controlled the Churches of Asia Minor, of Greece, of the islands in the \u00c6gean Sea, of the two Mcesias, of the trans-Danubian regions, and even those of Russia. 6 See Crusii Turco-Gr\u00e6cia, p. 197."], [155, "Letter II.

From that time the custom has been for the deputies of the Servian people to elect this dignitary, and then submit their choice to the approbation of the Emperor of Austria.7 In Russia, the patriarchal seat of Kiew 8 had been for nearly a century independent of that of Constantinople, when it was abolished by Peter the Great, who appro priated its revenues, and instituted in its place a synod entirely dependent on the crown. At the beginning of the eighteenth century he obliged this body to acknow ledge him as head of the Church. The synod is composed of metropolitans and archbishops, under the presidence of the metropolitan of Novogorod, and of a lay delegate who presents an annual report to the Emperor.9 It is charged with the temporal administration of the Church, the spiritual authority being entirely in the hands of the Czar. ' Set ' Servian review, published at Pesth in 1850. From a statistical table published at the same time, it appears that the Servian patriarchate of Carlowitz includes 8 dioceses, 57 deaneries, '2465 eccle siastics, 1706 churches, 32 convents, and 1,716,697 ofthe faithful. 6 Or Kiev. 9 The delegate at this time is the Colonel Protasoff.

Bulgaria, Thrace, Macedonia, part of Epirus and Thessaly, Turkey in Asia, and Egypt. The Patriarch of Constantinople exercises a direct authority over about three-fourths of these countries, peopled by six millions of orthodox believers, two millions of whom are Greeks, and four millions Sclavonians ; the remaining portion, consisting of Egypt and a part of Turkey in Asia, is under the jurisdiction of the three Patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.

This right of equality has always been recognised by the law, in spite of the frequent attempts made by the Church of Constantinople to encroach on the independence of the other Churches in Turkey. In 1843 a violent alter cation arose on the subject of a claim set up by the holy synod of Jerusalem to elect its patriarchs without the participation of the synod of Constantinople. Two parties were formed \u2014 one of which energetically supported the prerogatives of the \u0153cumenical prelate, whilst the other argued that these prerogatives were too limited, and his su premacy over the other patriarchs of the Orthodox Church too uncertain, to entitle him to intervene in the election of prelates whose rights and privileges were distinct from, if not equal to, his own. The Porte judiciously abstained from interference in this dispute, which has been on the point of producing a schism in the very bosom of the Church, and which is not yet decided. The Patriarchate of Constantinople comprises in its jurisdiction 108 eparchies (dioceses), of which 86 are styled metropolitan : of the latter some are merely nominal, corresponding to what we call \"Sees in partibus.\" Of these 86 metropolitan sees 58 are in European Turkey, 16 in Turkey in Asia, and 12 in the Archipelago.

His ordinary residence is at Da mascus. The Patriarchate of Jerusalem was erected in 418 by Juvenal, 44th bishop since the Apostle St. James, and confirmed by the council of Chalcedon in 451. It was originally formed by the annexation of Palestine and Arabia, these countries having up to that time been subject respectively to the Patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria. The Patriarchs of Jerusalem, subject in civil matters to the Emperors of Constantinople, were entirely independent in their ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and were placed in the fifth rank among the orthodox patriarchs, administering the countries subject to their authority according to the \u0153cumenical canons. They were elected, as at the present day, by their own synods, notifying their election to the other patriarchs by letter.4 The Patriarchate of Jerusalem, now the poorest of all, by reason of the limited extent of its territory, is partly sup ported by the monastery of the Holy Sepulchre, which is ' Reply to the pamphlet of M.

Of the (Ecumenical Patriarch and of the Holy Synod. The Sultan Mohammed II. , says M. von Hammer, on the very day of his entry into Constantinople (1st June, 1453) took measures for the election of a new Greek patriarch, to be chosen and consecrated according to ancient usage. The choice of the synod fell upon the monk Scholarius, called also Gennadius. The Sultan invited him to a sumptuous repast, and when, after a long and friendly discouise, Gennadius was about to withdraw, bestowed on him a precious sceptre, addressing him thus : \u2014 \" Be the patriarch, and may Heaven protect you ! Enjoy all the rights and privileges that, your prede- - have enjoyed before you.\" Shortly after, by a diploma declaring the person of the patriarch inviolable, his privileges and those of his Church were further secured"], [163, "Letter II.

The synod, which in the government of the Orthodox Church may be said to represent the legislative body, meets on certain fixed days in a hall (synodikon) of the patriarchal palace ; its decisions in matters of faith and discipline are absolute ; it also nominates to the vacant dioceses in the jurisdiction of the patriarchate of Constan tinople, takes cognizance of the appeals from the judgments pronounced by the episcopal courts of the various dioceses, superintends and directs the schools, discusses ail measures of general interest, and audits yearly the accounts of the committee charged with administering the revenues and expenses of the community.2 The revenues are of two kinds ; the one derived from the annual dues paid by each metropolitan or bishop, according to the number of families in his diocese : the other derived from the sale of bishoprics, the price of which is in proportion to the extent and wealth of each eparchy. The amount of these revenues is paid into the patriarchal fund (jo xoitoii), which forms alike the public treasury of the Church and of the nation. The synod appoints one or more of its members to be custodes (keepers) of the synodical stamp or seal, which is preserved in the synodikon, and bears the following insc ription, \u2014 \" The servants ; the Greek Patriarch of Con- ' This committee is composed of eighteen members, chosen among the chief persons in the nation."], [165, "Letter II. THE PATRIARCH AND THE SYNOD. 129 stantuwple ; and the metropolitans of the synod holding its session in the capital.\" The synod, which in conjunction with the delegates of the nation has the power of electing and also of deposing the patriarch, is composed of the twelve metropolitans of C\u00e6sarea, Ephesus, Nicomedia, Heraclea, Salonica, Chal cedonia, Derkon, Hadrianople, Nicea, Tirnova, Cyzicum, and Amasia, under the presidency of the patriarch : three lay members, M. Aristarchi, grand Logothetis and ex-Prince of Samos, M. Vogoridis, and M. Psycharis, were added to it in 1847, by virtue of a bou'iourouldou of the Porte, in spite of the remonstrances of the patriarch and bishops, who rejected this innovation as contrary to the holy canons and to the immunities of the \u0153cumenical seat. It is not, however, their province to interfere in anything that concerns the doctrine or discipline of the Church ; nor to take a direct part in the appointment of archbishops. The number of these latter in the synod is not fixed ; and it is customary to summon all the patriarchs and bishops present in Constantinople to decide cases of importance. It thus happens that the synodal statute, formerly mentioned, which recognises the independence of the Hellenic Church, bears the signature of five ex patriarchs of Constantinople, of the patriarch of Jerusa lem, and of fourteen metropolitans or bishops. The titles of the patriarch are, \" N , by the grace of God, Archbishop of Constantinople, the new Rome ; and \u0152cumenical Patriarch.\" He is addressed, in speaking or writing, by the title of \" Panhagiotis Sas \" (your all holiness;. The three patriarchs of -Alexandria, Antioch, g 3"], [166, "Letter II. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 130 and Jerusalem, are simply styled \" Makariotis Sas ' (your blessedness.) The prerogatives of the patriarch, as well as the revenues which compose his income, are referable to his double capacity as chief of the Cnurch and Archbishop of Con stantinople. The patriarchal income is derived, first, from the revenues of his chancelry (chancellerie) ; secondly, from the sums paid, under the name of presents, by each metro politan or bishop, either when he is himself promoted to a see or at the enthronement of the patriarch ; thirdly, from the collation of the ephimerias, or cures of souls, depending to the patriarchal Church ; fourthly and lastly, from the produce of a tax of ten per cent., which the patriarch, in his quality as civil judge of the diocese, has the right to levy on all causes brought before his tribunal. The whole of these revenues may amount to between 3200/. and 0/. annually. Dependent on the patriarch are the secular or lay clergy. The origin of this body, peculiar to the Eastern Church, may be traced back far beyond the conquest, when the successors of Constantine, borrowing a host of sumptuous formalities from the Orientals, multiplied the great offices of the court in proportion as the empire became gradually weaker. The Church, following Lhis example, surrounded itself with a considerable number of dignitaries, who formed a retinue to the \u0153cumenical i , and who were distinguished by titles answering to those of the civil functionaries. A slight tonsure, and a simple consecration by the imposition of hands, were the only forms required to show the connection of these with"], [167, "Letter II. 131 THE PATRIARCH AND THE SYNOD. the ecclesiastical orders. They were divided, as indeed they still are, into two classes of five members each., designated under the name of first and second pentas. In the one are the grand logothetis, or high chancellor of the patriarchate : the skevophylax, or keeper of the wardrobe : the kartophyla.v, or keeper of the records ; the chief ecclesiarch, and the chief orator. The second penta com prises, the grand treasurer, the protonotary, the re) dary in chancery, the protosyngelos, and the chief of the choir. In the train of these dignitaries comes a of subaltern officers, also under the designation of clergy, such as the protopsalter, the lamladomarios, the protocano marchos, the nomophylax, the castrincius, and a multitude of others too numerous to particularise. x\\lthough the greater part of these offices are at the present day sinecures, they are nevertheless profitable owing to the mode of payment for appointments practised in the Greek Church ; all dignitaries, from the patriarch down to the humblest priest, levying on their immediate inferiors a fee or tax for their elevation. Mohammed, at the time he invested Gennadius with the dignity of Patriarch, conferred on him, as head of the Greek Church, an annual pension of a hundred ducats of gold. This gift of imperial munificence passed as a right to the earliest successors of Gennadius, Isidore and Joseph : and the first attack on it came from the Greeks themselves. At the fourth patriarchal election after the conquest, the synod being greatly divided and a prey to discord among themselves, an ambitious monk, named Kilocarabes, who had risen as it were from the dust of the cloister, managed to secure his election by obtaining, or"], [168, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter II. 132 rather purchasing, the support of the Divan by means of gold and presents skilfully distributed amongst the mi- - and persons of influence in the government. From this time the ancient mode of election and investiture underwent a complete change : the patriarchal dignity was purchased by the highest bidder; and, instead of receiving a dotation from the imperial treasury, the patriarchs were compelled to pay an annual contribution. This contribution, by the terms of the original ordinance (renewed 30th of June, 1789), was fixed at 32,000 piastres, besides the rights of kalemie (registering), fixed at 10 per cent. : but the value of the customary presents made to ministers and grandees of the Porte raised it to triple that sum. The Turkish government, which is essentially fiscal, having thus intervened in the nomination of the patriarchs, extended a similar intervention to all the archbishops and bishops of the empire, and a department, under the name of Piscopos kalemi, was created for the obtaining and registration of bairats. I have already stated that the election of the Patriarchs of Constantinople was conducted by the synod 3 conjointly with the delegates of the Greek nation. As soon as the \u0153cumenical chair becomes vacant, either by the death or the deposition of the titular, the twelve metropolitans and the bishops present at Constantinople, the members of the two pentas, and the rest of the lay clergy, as well as the notables chosen from among the merchants, the artisans, 3 Page 3G."], [169, "Letter II. 133 THE PATRIARCH AND THE SYNOD. and the heads of the esnafs,4 assemble in the Synodikon for the purpose of choosing a successor. The election is made either by acclamation, according to ancient custom, or by scrutiny, but always in presence of a commissioner delegated by the Porte. In the first case the synod deli berates concerning the selection of the candidates, and afterwards proposes the most fitting person to the notables and heads of corporations. The Archbishop of C\u00e6sarea, as the senior dignitary, names the candidate in an audible voice, and the assembly approves or rejects the nomination by crying, Axios ! (he is worthy), or Anaxios ! (he is not worthy). In the latter case the synod proposes a new can didate. When all are agreed, the name of the individual elected is immediately proclaimed, amidst, the applauses of the assembly, echoed by thousands of Greeks congre gated round the patriarchal palace. Finally, the presi dent of the synod, mounting the pulpit, addresses a discourse to the new patriarch, enumerating his duties and functions, pointing out the path he should follow, the dangers he should avoid, and inviting him to follow tbe example of his predecessor, zealously watching over the orthodox faith, and preserving the purity of its doctrines. The next day the new patriarch pays an official visit to the grand vizir and to the minister of foreign affairs : from the former he receives his bairat and the insignia of his new dignity. Such is the mode of election most commonly practised. But when several parties support different candidates, and 4 Esnafs, guilds or corporations. See Letter III."], [170, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter II. 134 there is reason to suppose that the election will be tumultuous, the government causes a list of the notables to be prepared, and cards of admission to the Synodikon to be distributed to each applicant \u2014 the election then takes place by ballot, and is decided in the usual manner by majority of votes. The election of Mgr. Anthimos, in December, 1845, was thus conducted. The nomination is approved by the Sultan, and the new patriarch proceeds next day to the palace to receive his investiture with the usual ceremonies. In like manner the deposition of a patriarch is effected by a sentence of the synod, ratified by the Porte. We find in the \" Turco-Gr\u00e6cia,\" under the date of 1564, an account of the deposition of the Patriarch Joseph, ex-metropolitan of Adrianople, signed by 52 metro politans and archbishops ; at this period all the bishops present in Constantinople were members of the synod by right. The patriarch, if in danger of being deposed, generally avoids the sentence by a voluntary resignation, retiring to some remote diocese, generally in Asia, or to one of the monasteries of the Prince's Islands. The deposition of a patriarch does not incapacitate him from again occupying the \u0153cumenical chair ; and the list of the patriarchs contains the names of several who have been at least six times deposed and re-elected in the course of their career. Of the twenty-five patriarchs whose lives have been written by Crusius, and who occupied uriarchal seat of Constantinople from 1453 to 1574, thirteen were deposed or imprisoned, two abdicated, and one died by poison. Two others were put to death in the reign of Mohammed IV., in 1651 and 1657, for the crime of high"], [171, "Letter II. 135 METROPOLITANS AND BISHOPS. treason. But the most terrible catastrophe of this kind was the execution of the patriarch Gregory, on Easter- Day, 1821, which has been already related5. Up to the year 1732, at which period the catalogue of the \"Oriens Christianus\" ceases, there had been 95 patriarchs since Gennadius. Their number now reaches 143, thus giving an average term of 2 years and 10 months for each. The other patriarchs, not having a political character like the Patriarch of Constantinople, are subject to fewer vicissitudes, and the Porte rarely interferes in their affairs, unless in cases of grave com plaints on the part of their flocks. The remainder of the Greek clergy is divided into two orders ; the first, composed of the Hieromonachi, or priests who have taken vows of celibacy, includes, besides the regular clergy, all the dignitaries of the Church from the patriarch to the bishops ; the second comprises all the inferior clergy, as the papas,6 deacons, subdeacons, &c., who are allowed to marry before taking orders. IV. Metropolitans and Bishops. We have seen that there are twelve of the metropolitans who have admission to the synod in right of their rank : these are the metropolitans of C\u00e6sarea, Ephesus, Flera clea, Derkon, Nicomedia, Chalcedonia, Salonica, Adria nople, Nicea, Tirnova, Cyzicum, and Amasia. The eight 3 See page 1 6 Papas (*xva.s) is the singular; it makes in the plural tkt\u00abSs,-, papades. \u2014 T."], [172, "Letter II. 136 LETTERS ON TURKEY. first are called \" Gerontes\" (ancients) ; the four others, like all the metropolitans and the four Archbishops of Cyprus, Letitza, Carpathos, and Mezzovo, are styled Panicrotati (most holy). The suffragans are simply called Theo philisteti (very dear to God). All indiscriminately receive in discourse the qualification of despotes (master). By an abuse which prevails also in the Latin Church, certain metropolitans, and even some simple bishops, either by reason of the antiquity or other pretensions of their see, add to their appellations a series of titles corresponding to ancient ecclesiastical dignities which no longer exist. Such are the metropolitan of C\u00e6sarea, who styles himself Primate and Exarch of all the East ; that of Heraclea, Primate and Exarch of Thrace and Macedonia, &c. Similarly in France, the Archbishop of Lyons styles him self Arch-Count of Lyons, Primate of Gaul ; the Arch bishop of Bourges, Primate of Aquitaine, &c. Independently of these purely honorary distinctions. each prelate placed at the head of an eparchy exercises similar functions and enjoys similar privileges, whatever his ecclesiastic title. His functions are both religious and civil, like those of the patriarch, whom each represents in his particular province. His privileges, mentioned in his bairat, consist principally in exemption from personal ser vice, and in immunity from imprisonment in ordinary cases. The metropolitans and archbishops are nominated by the synod, themselves choosing their suffragans ; but this nomination is always attended with considerable expense, every prelate, on taking possession of his eparchy, being obliged to pay to the patriarch a sum, under the name of present (philotimon), which varies from 15,000 to 80,000"], [173, "Letter II. METROPOLITANS AND BISHOPS. 137 piastres. The tariff of the Philotimons for the different eparchies is regidated according to their respective im portance.7 If the new prelate does not possess the capital of the sum demanded, he signs certain bonds,8 which bear an annual interest of 10 per cent. : the synod recognises and guarantees the^e bonds, and the bishop generally con tri\\es that they shall be speedily liquidated. Should he how ever die or be displaced before the extinction of his debt, it becomes a charge upon his successor. The episcopal income is derived, 1st, from the tax im posed on every family of the eparchy, according to the bairat ; 9 2nd, from the usufruct of the metropolitan or diocesan church ; 3rd, from the fees for ordinations ; 4th, from the tax on successions and matrimonial dispensa tions ;'\u2022 5th, from certain customary dues (adeti), to enforce the payment of which even the bishop may demand the aid of the Turkish authorities, though not mentioned in his bairat It is difficult from their uncertain nature to estimate the amount of these revenues. They vary in general from 15,000 to 100,000 piastres, according to the extent and resources of the eparchies. From this sum the me tropolitan has to deduct the interest of the capital and of the cost of the bairat ; and also the amount of such annual dues as he is bound to pay either to the patriarch or to 7 In 1847 a project was entertained for regulating this tax, which is subject to numerous abuses, but it fell to the ground. 9 Called aulikife omologife. 9 Ricault, in his History of the Greek and Armenian Churches (p. 115), gives the copy of one of these bairats, the exact model of which still exists. 1 No marriage in the Greek Church can be celebrated without a dis pensation, purchased of the patriarch or bishop. Confession, absolution, the communion of the sick, and baptism, are also subject to fees, of which the bishop claims a share."], [174, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter II. 138 the synod, and which are estimated at about one-fourth of his legal revenue.2 Every metropolitan is attended by a numerous train of followers, composed of inferior clergy, monks, and even cer tain bishops \u2014 it being the usage of the Greek Church in Turkey that all ecclesiastics aspiring to the higher dig nities must commence with the humblest offices. These attendants present the superior with his pipe, serve him at table, hold his stirrup, and escort him on foot when he rides through the city. It must be observed, however, that these and similar ceremonious services are in conformity with Turkish usages, and imply no sort of dishonour ; they con stitute a kind of noviciate analogous to that of the esquires in the feudal system. In the intervals of their occupations the young novices learn to read and to chant ; they pro gress to the study of Hellenic Greek, and of the Holy Scriptures, and are eventually attached to some monastery, from which they soon, by the aid of their patron, arrive at a bishopric. V. Of the Inferior Clergy. We will now proceed to examine the constitution of a parish or Ephimeria. The first functionary is the proestbs, whose office it is to recite the Lord's Prayer, Creed, &c, in the ritual, and also to officiate in external rites and ceremonies, as baptisms, marriages, and burials ; secondly, the pneumaticos or confessor, who must be at least forty years of age, and provided with a written licence from the 2 It must be understood that I am only taking into account the tributes that are legally levied in accordance with the privileges of the bairat, and which seldom amount to a fifth part of a bishop's exactions."], [175, "139 Letter II. THE INFERIOR CLERGY. bishop ; thirdly the papas ephimerlo, who recites the liturgy, chants matins and vespers, and takes part in all the Church ceremonies : the last rank comprises the deacon and two choristers, who may either be in orders or secular; the canonarch or reader, wdio recites the hymns chanted by the choristers ; and finally, the candelanaptis or beadle.3 The last-mentioned have received no eccle siastical orders, but all the rest are comprehended under the general denomination of papas (papades, priests), and form, as I have said, the second order of the Greek clergy. The precediug enumeration must be considered as refer able to a large parish only \u2022; since the greater number of churches in villages, and even in cities, are served only by an ephimerios, who discharges all functions, with the assistance of a chorister and one or two acolytes.

With the ex ception of the Proestbs, the parochial clergy are paid out of the parish funds, mainly derived from alms-collections, and they also have a share in the surplice fees. The priests of the villages are wretchedly poor : all their revenues consist in a few trifling fees, of which a portion is to be deducted for the bishop, in a slight assignment out of the communal fund, and in the slender contributions which they receive from peasants as poor as themselves, for performing the ceremony of the \" Aghiasmos,\" or house-blessing, at the beginning of every month. Out of this the priest is obliged to pay the expenses of his ordination and of his cure of souls ; to annually pay to his bishop two ducats on the festivals of Easter and the Epiphany, under pain of excommunication ; and finally, to redeem himself from the perpetually recur rinjr interdictions which overtake the smallest trans gression.

Let us not be hasty therefore to reproach these poor priests with greediness and ignorance, for both are the unavoidable necessity of their condition \u2014 at the same time it must be owned that their ignorance is incredible. It appears, from the work of Crusius, that at the beginning of the seventeenth century very few among the priesthood and monastic order were capable of understanding the psalter and the other books of the ritual.5 The priest of a poor country village, having once in his life had occasion to visit the city of Salonica, determined to profit by that favourable opportunity to end a difficulty that had long perplexed him : addressing himself therefore to one of his brethren of the city, he inquired, \"Is it true that Jesus Christ is God ? I certainly have heard some people say so. Then again I have heard others say he is man. If he is a God, how can he be a man ? If he is a man, how can he be God ? 'Which of these things is one to believe ? it is very certain that one cannot believe both.\" This ignorance of the inferior clergy ceases to surprise when we learn the manner in which they are prepared for the Church. In the year 1847 I happened frequently to meet with the priest of one of the villages on the Bos phorus ; he was a good sort of man, dividing his time between saying masses for his parishioners at a piastre apiece, weaving mats for his livelihood, and smoking his chibouk. As we were very good friends, often chatting together, he one day related to me his history, which is that of three-fourths of his brethren.

His subse quent education was completed by a Loghiotatos (scholar or pedant), who qualified him to use the Church ritual by making him learn by rote the forms for the baptismal, marriage, and burial services, of which, being ignorant of the ancient Greek in which they are written, he of course understood not one word. However, having in due time by the foregoing process become qualified to aspire to the priesthood, he applied to the bishop of his district for admission to holy orders. The bishop demanded four hundred piastres, though at length, in consideration of the indigence of the applicant, he consented to reduce his demand to three hundred. The one sum was as much as the other beyond the reach of poor Methodius (as he was called), whose whole earthly possessions barely amounted to two hundred piastres. The bishop being inexorable, Methodius was obliged to seek for a more reasonable or more necessitous prelate, and at length dis covered one who was content to accept all that he had to give in exchange for his ordination. He afterwards found means to borrow the purchase-money for his cure of souls, the fees of which, together with the profits of his mat making, enabled him to eke out an existence, and to give his children a precarious support. His ignorance was extreme. I tried in vain to extract something from him on the subject of our different creeds ; but he had never heard of the \" Filio-que,\" nor of the Council of Nice.

Monasteries formerly were so numerous in Turco- Greece, that, according to the report of one traveller, the number of clergy exceeded that of the laity, espe cially in Bulgaria, Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly, the Morea, and the Cyclades. Many of these monasteries were destroyed during the war of Greek independence ; others, which formerly enjoyed a great reputation \u2014 as St Cyriani near Athens, St. Luke in B\u0153otia, Megaspi leon and St. George on Mount Kalmos in Arcadia \u2014 are now included in the dominions of King Otho. Among the Greek monasteries still remaining in Turkey, those most noticeable are the monasteries of Mount Athos, of Meteora, of Mount Sinai, and of the Princes' Islands. The Greeks designate by the name of Mount Athos, or the \"Holy Mountain\" (Agion Oros),6 not only the peak of Athos itself, but the whole extent of the peninsula between the gulfs of Contessa and Monte-Santo, which forms the eastern extremity of Macedonia, and is united to the continent by an isthmus about a mile and a half wide, through which Xerxes endeavoured to cut a pas sage for his fleet. The whole length of this peninsula is forty miles, and its greatest breadth about nine. Mount Athos_ rises in the centre to a height of more than 6000 feet, with a base of about seventy miles in circum- 6 Frequently also Monte Santo."], [180, "Letter II. 144 LETTERS ON TURKEY. ference. Its summit, covered with snow even in the month of August, is visible at sea in clear weather from a very great distance. Vast enclosures, bounded by high turreted walls, and resembling small cities, crown the heights, or are based on the sides of the mountain. These are the abodes of the monks, or caloyers, as they are called in the Eastern Church. Each monastery has a communication with the sea by a zigzag path de scending to the shore, and terminating in a creek which forms a small harbour. Two of these monasteries \u2014 namely, Zographos, situated on the western side of the peninsula, and Chilindari, near the cape of the same name, founded by King Stephen of Servia,\" in the twelfth century \u2014 are occupied by Bulgarian monks, who perform divine service in the Sclavonic language. A third, known by the name of Boussikon, was founded by the Empress Catherine for Russian monks. Many hermitages are scattered through the deep gorges, or perched on the loftiest peaks : they are easily recognised by the cross which surmounts them. These apparently inaccessible abodes are the retreat of anchorites, called by the Greeks Phileremes. At the present day the district of Mount Athos reckons twenty greater monasteries, each containing from six to thirty-three churches ; two hundred and fifty isolated cells (kellia), with as many chapels; one hundred and fifty hermitages : and ten villages composed of scattered houses : in all nine hundred and thirty-five churches, chapels, or oratories, in a space not exceeding ten leagues in diameter. The \" in terior walls of all these buildings,\" says a traveller, \" are painted in fresco, or covered with pictures on wood ; the refectories of the convents are also profusely adorned with"], [181, "145 Letter II.

These monasteries became in progress of time places of refuge for disappointed ambition, for the fallen favourites of the imperial court, and for the unfortunate in general. Some sought, within their walls an asylum in which peacefully to await death, others to expect a restoration to imperial favour. The conquest made little change in the aspect of the \" Holy Mountain.\" Mohammed II. not only forbore to molest the caloyers : he even protected them on condi tion of their paying a small tribute.8 The monasteries remained unharmed as much by reason of the toleration systematically observed by the Musulmans towards their rai'ahs,9 as of a certain degree of respect which they entertain towards religious orders in general. Their principal features remain the same at the present day as when visited in 1545, less than a century after the conquest, by the traveller and naturahst Belon, who was the first to give an account of them \u2014 as if the life of the caloyer partook of the immobility of the rocks on which his habitation is placed. 7 Annales des Apotres Modernes, v. ii. p. 117. 8 Pendunt omnia monasteria, ne ullam molestiam Turc\u00e6 inferant, quotannis duo millia aleorum.

The hour of prayer is announced by repeated strokes on a plate of wood or metal (the use of bells being interdicted to Christian churches in Turkey). At the sound of this signal, which is repeated from convent to convent, and heard throughout the mountain, the religious ceremonies commence. These consist in the nasal intoning of psalms and liturgies, and in genuflexions (metanoia) sometimes repeated three hundred times in succession.2 In such exercises, and the observance of the frequent and rigid fasts3 enjoined by the Eastern Church, consists nearly all 2 See Waddington, On the Greek Church. 3 At the commencement of Lent, nearly three whole days, the Mon day, Tuesday, and Wednesday of Quinquagesima week, are passed with out eating or drinking : the kitchen and refectory are closed, and the first meal permitted is on the Wednesday at three or four o'clock in the afternoon : the same austerity is practised at the conclusion of Lent : from Holy Thursday the monks remain without food till the following Saturday evening.

Every monastery possesses, nevertheless, one or more libraries, rich in manuscripts of antiquity and of the middle ages. The learned professor Athanius of Chios, writing at the end of the last century, speaks of the libraries of St. Laura and of Ivron on Mount Athos as the most considerable that existed at that time in Greece. During the revolution of 1821 they all sustained irrepar able damage. The Turks, who more than once had mili tary possession of the monasteries, tore up the manuscripts to make cartridges, and injured the marbles and frescoes of the churches, with an ignorance and barbarism only equalled by the previous barbarism and neglect of the monks themselves. The ' Scolia' on Homer, being written on parchment, had served the latter as fishing-baits, whilst ' Lives of Illustrious Men ' were used to stop crevices of doors and windows. Bougainville, in his ' Voyage,' mentions a lay brother of Meteora, who, hap pening to be the baker of the convent, used daily to light his oven with the manuscripts which he found in a room of the monastery, and in this way a considerable number of priceless treasures were destroyed for ever.

They have recently been partially explored by men of science from France and Germany. In 1843, M. Mynoide Mynas, charged with a scientific mission in the East by M. Villemain, then Minister of Public Instruction in France, brought away forty-one manuscripts and some marbles, collected chiefly in the monastery of St. Laura, and relating to subjects of philosophy, law, medicine, &c/J The sensation caused by these discoveries has awakened suspicions in the monks as to the value of their treasures, and made it difficult for strangers now to obtain access to their libraries ; and even their hospitality, owing to the same cause, has been less liberally proffered, so that more than one traveller of the present day, bent upon minute inspection of the monasteries, has been compelled to abandon his intention and shorten his visit, having, by some indiscreet question, given alarm to the prior, and * The following extract, from the ' Journal a la Main ' of M.

A general assembly (Synodon) is annually held in the month of May, at Raria, a town which forms one of the eleven Kazas, or districts, of the Lira of Salonica : to this assembly each monastery sends a delegate, and the assem bled delegates in their turn elect four magistrates, called Epistatis, who are invested with the general government of the Holy Mountain, and whose president must always belong to one of the five great convents of St. Laura,5 Vatopedi, Iphiron, Chilandari, or St. Dionysius.

One prohibition, peculiar to the monasteries of Mount Athos, where it has existed from time immemorial, appears to proceed as much from superstition as from a desire to maintain the severity of the monastic rule. No female of any race, biped or quadruped, is allowed to approach the Holy Mountain : the greater part of the brethren revering their abode as a spot consecrated by various miracles, and believing that its sanctity would suffer were the presence of any creature of the femi nine gender permitted to approach it.

To the produce of these collections must be added the offering's which the orthodox Churches of Greece and Russia send yearly to the monasteries of the Holy Moun tain, and also their share in the revenues of the \" dedi cated \" monasteries of Walachia and Moldavia The origin of this dedication, which constitutes one of the most important and difficult points in the financial economy of the principalities, renders a short digression necessary. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, at the pe riod when the government of the principalities was first intrusted to Greeks of the Fanar, the provinces contained a great number of monasteries which had been founded in former times by native princes or nobles. The immense domains attached to them had been originally granted on condition that the revenue, or some portion of it, should be employed in works of public charity or utility \u2014 such as the founding of a school or an hospital attached to the monastery, supporting a certain number of indigent fami lies of the district, bestowing annually marriage portions on a certain number of orphan girls, &c. Some of these conditions, though formally inserted in the deeds of grant, had fallen into disuse even under the administration of the"], [189, "Letter II. 153 MONASTERIES. native princes ; the abuses became far worse under the Fanariotes. The latter cancelled the greater part of the original grants, aud subsituted \" chrysobulls \" (as they were called), by which a portion of the monasteries of the country were dedicated (the word used is, in the Roumain dialect, \" inclinare\") to the Greek communities ofthe Holy Sepulchre, Mount Sinai, and Mount Athos.7 Originally the dedication appeared to be, as the word implies, a simple homage tending to establish the superiority of the Greek over the native race, but neither involving real possession nor any right to the usufruct of the revenues. Tlie monasteries were in the habit of applying their funds to the support of local establishments of public utility, to paying the government taxes, and to the general expenses of the community ; after which, any surplus that might remain was sent either to the Holy Sepulchre or to Mount Athos, under the name of \" offering.\" But when these Greek communities succeeded in obtaining from the Fanariote hospodars permission to depute liegoumenes, or priors, to represent them in the principalities, and to administer in their name the income of the \" dedicated \" monasteries, the homage soon became servitude, and a share in the surplus revenue a right of absolute possession. Not only did they appropriate the whole income of thest monasteries, but even pretended the right of disposing of the capital. The divans of the hospodars, and subse quently the national assemblies, constantly protested against this spoliation, which alienated to foreigners more 7 The number of these monasteries amounts to 59 for Walachia, and 43 for Moldavia: V.sl in all, 28 of which were \" dedicated \" to Mount Athos. h3"], [190, "154 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

In 1822, when the government of the two provinces returned into the hands of the native princes, a firman of the Porte annulled the pretensions of the Greek monks, and restored the monastic revenues of the principalities to their legitimate owners : these latter were, however, again despoiled by the fresh arrangements of 1831, which were entirely in favour of the Greek pretensions ; the only con dition being that the Greek communities should pay an annual sum of two millions of Wallachian piastres (about 28,000?.), which was allotted to the school funds.8 Some idea may be formed of the wealth of the monas teries thus alienated when we consider that these two millions of piastres do not exceed a tenth part of their actual revenues in Wallachia alone. The provisional government of 1848 decreed the emancipation of these tributary monasteries, and named a commission to fix the amount of the annual indemnity that should be assigned to the Holy Places under the former name of \" offering :\" but the labours of the commission were arrested, three months afterwards, by the fall of the provisional govern ment, and things resumed their former state ; so that even at the present day the total amount of the tribute paid by the principalities to foreign monasteries may be estimated at 400,000/., nearly a quarter of which goes to the account of Mount Athos. The monastery of Mount Sinai has likewise its share, \" We must deduct from this sum 300,000 piastres, allotted to the Patriarch of C i ile for the support of Greek schools in Turkey."], [191, "155 Letter II.

This monastery contains about a hundred monks, under a superior who is styled Archbishop and Head of Mount Sinai : the rule observed in it is extremely austere. Tlie archbishop, as we have already observed, is chosen by election, but receives his investiture from the Patriarch of Jerusalem. The monasteries of the Princes' Islands were formerly among the most flourishing in Turkey. This name has been bestowed on a group of small islands situated at the entrance of the Gulf of Nicomedia, in the Sea of Marmora. It consists of five barren rocks and four habitable islands. namely, Proti, Antigoni, Khalki, and Prinkisso ; the last, having been a place of exile for certain princes of the imperial family, gives its name to the whole group. The monasteries of these islands are now almost abandoned by their former occupants, and serve chiefly as places of retreat and rendezvous to the Greek aud Frank merchants of Constantinople during the summer months. Some oi monasteries have been diverted to uses entirely different from their original destination : that of Haghia Triada (Holy Trinity) has been converted into a school, dependent on the patriarch ; that of St. George, in the island of Prinkisso, to an hospital for the insane ; another monastery on the same island is now the summer residence of the Patriarch of Jerusalem. A few pale and sad-looking monks, or even a deposed patriarch, aeccompanied by two or three faithful priests who have not deserted him in his fall, may sometimes be seen wandering through the empty cloisters like the ghosts of former inhabitants, in striking contrast to the evidence afforded by the buildings them selves of their former monastic population and prosperity."], [192, "Letter II. 156 LETTERS ON TURKEY. It now only remains to speak of the Thessalian monas teries of Meteora, which are situated in the wildest regions of Mount Pindus. Perched on the summits of precipitous and isolated rocks, some of which rise to a height of three hundred feet, the only access to these aerial prisons is by nets attached to ropes and pulleys, by means of which the visitor is drawn up, or by ladders firmly fixed to the rock in those places where its surface affords any points of sus pension. These monasteries are now seven in number ; the largest is Meteoron,9 or Meteora, partly rebuilt in 1371, by John Pal\u00e6ologus ; Aghia Triada (the Holy Trinity), founded by Maria Pal\u00e6ologus, in 1436 ; that of Varlaam, founded in 1536, and which during the time of Ali Pasha of Yanina was used as a prison ; and the convents St. Nicholas, Rosaria, St Stephen, and the Trinity.1 They were formerly more numerous ; but many have been ruined by the progress of time, by wars, and also by the natural decomposition of the rocks on which they were based.

Having now terminated our account of the several classes of the Greek clergy, and of the general organisa tion of the Orthodox Church in the East, it may be desirable to complete the picture by showing more parti cularly the corruptions by which this church is continually undermined ; but as description would feebly convey the impression of the evils which these corruptions \u2014 simony, superstition, fanaticism, and imposture \u2014 entail on the people, I prefer to relate a conversation which I once held with a Greek of Smyrna. It was in 1849, during the Holy Week. My friend was a man considerably advanced in years ; by extensive travel in his youth he had acquired an independence of thought and a tolerant spirit rarely found amongst his countrymen.

Nowhere is the maxim, that the priest must live by the altar, practised on so grand a scale, and at the same time with so little scandal, as with us, for even those who suffer by the system are not shocked at it. ' \" But,\" said I, \" whence do these abuses spring ? From an inherent vice in your church, or as a consequence of the conquest?\" \" Though following the conquest,\" answered he, \" they cannot be called a con sequence of it.

What has ever prevented the synod, or what prevents it even now, from assigning to the patriarch and secular clergy a fixed revenue from the funds of the community ? and the Porte would never have opposed such a measure, provided that the fiscal duties had been secured and the fee of the bairat regularly paid. But the patriarchs and the bishops have preferred deriving their revenues in the mode practised in the Lower Empire ; a mode which was universal during the middle ages, when, instead of the state comprising the church, it was the church that com prised the state. \" At that period, however, the fatal effects of the system were in some degree modified by the wealth of the clergy, continually augmented, by the liberality of the emperors. But after the conquest the church was despoiled of its domains, and the Porte, taking advantage of the divisions and intrigues which perplexed the synod, disposed at its pleasure of ecclesiastical preferments, whilst the patriarch, obliged to expend considerable sums for his election, acquitted his debt by taxing the metropolitans; the metropolitans levied exactions on the bishops, and so downwards to the lower grades. One of your writers has justly observed that the installation of a patriarch is for this afflicted church a jubilee which it celebrates by paying double duties. The exarchs open the campaign by a progress through the eparchies, provided with encyclic letters which authorise them to levy contributions in the metropolis and great, communities ; the metropolitans and bishops then commence the circuit (devri), not as formerly"], [196, "LETTERS ON TURKEY.

Have you seen the miracle of the fish in the church of Baloukli ? \" \" Never.\" \" You know the legend, however ? \" \" Not at all.\" \" Well then \u2014 on the morning of the capture of Constantinople, whilst the last ofthe Pal\u00e6ologi was making a final effort, and gloriously struggling amidst the ruins of his empire, our monks were engaged, as you know, in a noisy discussion about the nature of the light which they said was circulating about their navel. At the same moment, a monk of St. Basil was occupied in frying fish in the kitchen of his convent, situated just outside of the wall of Constantinople, on the high ground where the church of Baloukli now stands, between the Seven Towers and the gate of Silivria. Suddenly a messenger arrives covered with dust, who announces that the city is in the power of the Turks. ' I will believe it,' said the monk, ' when these fish shall be alive again in the frying-pan.' He had no sooner spoken the words than the fish began leaping out of the frying-pan into a tub full of water, where they swam and are still swimming. Go to Baloukli ; at the entrance of the church, under an arch, there is a cistern always guarded by a priest ; and in it you may see these fish with your own eyes, their scales sdvery white on one side and half-fried on the other. But you must first throw some small coin into the basin, or they will not appear. What think you of this ? there is not a church or Greek convent in Turkey which does not possess a miracle of this sort, authenticated by some legendary tale. In one place a miraculous spring {ayiaa^a) which protects"], [198, "Letter II. 162 LETTERS ON TURKEY. from the evil eye ; in another, some holy relic which cures women of sterility. All the saints perform miracles daily through the agency of the papas or caloyers, from Hagios Charalambos (St. Rocque) who preserves us from the plague, down to Hagia Varvara (St. Barbara) who provides husbands for young girls. \" I should never end were I to relate to you all the tricks and impostures of our priests \u2014 nevertheless there is generally more ignorance than evil design. It is often in all sincerity that they give heaven a portion of the profits of frauds practised on the people ; and promote the fanaticism and superstition of the vulgar. \" They have no conception of Christianity but in its external rites, and can only teach others what they believe and practise themselves. Their whole religion consists in the constant repetition of the sign of the cross, in attending mass, in kissing the pictures which adorn the templon (or screen),6 and in the strict ob servance of Lent and the other fasts.7 Thus it happens 6 Templon is the name given to the partition which separates the sanctuary from the rest of the church. As, according to the Greek rite, the consecration of the Host must be performed out of sight of the congregation, the officiating priest, concealed behind the screen, only appeara at the moment of elevation, making afterwards the tour of the church with his acolytes. The doors of the sanctuary are closed im mediately after the chalice has been replaced on the altar. 7 The Greeks have four Lents (tessaraeosti) : that before Easter, which lasts eight weeks ; that of the Holy Apostles, after Pentecost, three weeks ; that of the Holy Virgin, during the first fourteen days of August ; and that of Christmas, during forty days before Christmas. They have three fasts (nistia): one of twenty-six days, before St. De- ; the second, of four days, for the raising of the cross ; the third, of eight days, for St. Michael; without including Wednesday and Friday in every week, and sometimes Monday also. Finally, they have"], [199, "Letter II. INFLUENCE OF THE CLERGY. 163 that a priest may consent to give absolution to a thief or murderer, especially if the victim of the thief or the murderer chanced to have been an infidel or schismatic, but never to one who has transgressed the ' Tessara costi! I leave you to judge what must be the effect of such a religion on the popular morals. Not long ago, a Greek, on his way to join in the solemn devotions which the Church prescribes at Easter, beheld one of his most detested enemies a few paces in advance. His eye flashed, his hand was at the hilt of his dagger, but, suddenly recollecting himself, ' ara-ao, arxuo ' (wait, wait), he cried, ' I will settle your affair by and bye ; let me first receive the Holy Communion ! ' tie entered the church, received the Communion, and, on coming out, found his enemy in the same place, and, rushing upon him, plunged his dagger into his heart.8 I am aware that such excesses are committed elsewhere ; but what is most afflicting is, that with us they are rarely noticed, nor are they cared for even by the Church, which is always ready with its thunders to enforce the payment of its dues. \" Let us suppose, however, the case of a priest (and such exceptions are to be found) who should undertake to three vigils : those of the Epiphany, of St. John the Baptist, and of the Cross, \u2014 making a total of 238 days in the year on which they must either fast or abstain from meat, fish, and even dairy produce. s Another fact, less tragic, is related by M. Vaillant in his 'Rou manie:' \u2014 \"Basil, a famous brigand, after an affray in which a whole family had perished by the poignards of his band, perceived one of his men making free with a pot of butter. 'Pagan,' he cried, dealing a severe blow, 'hast thou no fear of God? Is it not Friday?' \" \u2014 La Rou manie, by M. Vaillant, t. ii. p. 71."], [200, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter II. 164 inculcate the precepts of a purer religion and sounder morality ; let us suppose what is more difficult, that this priest, intrusted with a cure of souls, should meet with no obstacles on the part of his superiors ; what, would be his means of influencing the rural populations that sur round him ? Religion, in my opinion, can only recommend itself to the people by the beneficent acts and by the per sonal dignity of the priesthood. The priest charged with preaching the Gospel to his parishioners should appear to them as one placed amongst them by Providence to aid, to comfort, and direct them on every occasion, as a kind of superior being, bearing in some degree a divine character. But how shall he gain the affections of his flock, if he be compelled to despoil it for his subsistence ? What can be his moral ascendancy over the people, if his condition does not differ in any respect from their own : sharing their ignorance, their rude labours, and the oppressions or contempt to which they may happen to be subjected ? \" Still these village priests, notwithstanding their poverty, which scarcely raises them above the level of the lowest peasant, and their ignorance, which retains them where their poverty has placed them, are far more estimable than the dignified clergy. Their fanaticism \u2014 a necessary consequence of their ignorance \u2014 is at least perfectly sin cere, and it is by their influence alone that the people have been preserved faithful to the religion of their ancestors. For the oppressed, it is a paramount necessity to cling to the belief of a protecting Deity and a future state ; and the priest is the organ, however unlearned, through which this belief reaches his flock : even when compelled by"], [201, "Letter II. 165 INFLUENCE OF THE CLERGY. his indigence to become in some degree their op pressor, they feel that he is an oppressor against his will : that he is in reality a victim like themselves, a com panion and brother in suffering ; and to him therefore they have recourse for counsel and consolation. If he cannot otherwise instruct, he can teach them patience by his own example, and give them some consolation under present ills by the recital of ancient traditions and pious legends, which announce, in a speedily approaching future, the fall of the Ottoman domination and the final triumph of the Cross. Thus it is that faith has survived among the people, and with faith nationality. The further we go from the capital, and remove from the influence of the patriarch and the synod, the more striking does this result become. In the Morea the priests, and even the bishops, never omitted to mingle national recollections and hopes of an approaching national restoration with the doctrines and rites of religion. When the insurrection broke out, the clergy were the first to take up arms, and their example was all-powerful in rousing the rest of Greece. Let not such things, however, be expected from our bishops and metropolitans. I would not, with Zal lony, accuse them of intentionally riveting the chains of our country by working, in concert with Turks and Fanariotes, to debase the national character. The ani mosity of Zallony towards the Fanar has led him into exaggerations ; but when has a patriarch ever refused to launch the thunders of the Church against his brethren guilty of rebellion against the Turks ? Think of Rhigas, and, more recently still, of Hypsilanti. Perhaps you will say the patriarch was compelled to act as he did. Granted ;"], [202, "Letter II. 166 LETTERS ON TURKEY. but a man may always choose between the committal of a base action and death. Thus, if these dignitaries have not systematically endeavoured to degrade our nation, at least they have done nothing to redeem it. On the contrary, it is through their exactions that we daily sink lower and lower; intent only on enriching themselves, they are indifferent to the general suffering. Money is the end of their ambition and of their intrigues. It is for money alone that they corrupt, ruin, and brutalise the people.\" 9 \" But,\" said I, after having long listened in silence to his remarks, \" you have sufficiently pointed out the evil : is there not a remedy ? \" \"The remedy,\" he replied, \"would be, first to diminish the number of bishops and great ecclesiastical dignitaries ; next, that the whole of the clergy, from the patriarch down to the humblest curate, should receive a fixed stipend, the funds for which might be obtained by a small annual contribution levied on each family throughout the nation, and which would afford a surplus that might be applied to maintain seminaries for the education of youths for the church. Amongst other advantages which would arise from my plan, such as the suppression of parochial fees, would be the equalising the pay of the clergy \u2014 the re moval of temptations to simony, to unjust exactions1 \u2014 and the gradual dispersion of the ignorance in which the priesthood are in general sunk.

The appellation of Greek (Roum) in official language is not applied exclusively to the populations of Hellenic origin, subjects of the Porte. It is used to designate indiscriminately all those of its Christian subjects, of whatever origin, who recognise the civil and religious jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople. This distinction must be borne in mind, in order to avoid an error prevalent in the East, where religion and na tionality are often confounded. A united Armenian, VOL. II. i"], [206, "170 LETTERS ON Ti RKEY. Letter III. or a Melkite of Syria, for example, when asked the question, \" Are you Armenian or Greek, or what?' would not fail to reply, \" No ; I am Catholic.\" A Maronite, on the other hand, when interrogated as to his faith, de nies that he is a Catholic, lest he should be confounded with the other populations of the Latin rite that inhabit Mount Lebanon. The designation \"Frank \" is similarly applied by the ( Irientals to Europeans in general ; and, taken in a sense sometimes political, sometimes religious, is used to designate French and English, Germans and Russians, as well as Catholics, Protestants, and Schismatic Greeks. The number of subjects of the Porte under the juris diction of the Patriarch of Constantinople, and forming the Greek nation or community, may be estimated at six millions. Of this number rather less than two millions are Romaics (a name given to the Greeks of Turkey to distinguish them from the Hellenes); the rest are almost entirely Sclavonian. The Greek race is dispersed throughout the whole empire, but in unequal proportions. In European Turkey it forms about the eleventh part of the whole population ; -;t Minor it scarcely amounts to the twenty-fifth part : whilst in the islands it, may be calculated at three fourths. Metellin contains 60,000 Greeks out of 80,000 inhabitants ; Rhodes 28,000 out of 38,000. The Greeks of European Turkey are in number from 950,000 to 1,000,000, about one-half of whom inhabit Constantinople and Thrace ; the remainder are found in ii\\ and other provinces, sometimes in isolated -, sometimes intermingled, as localities vary, with Albanians and Zingaris, or with Bulgarians and other"], [207, "Letter III. 171 STATISTICS OF THE GREEK COMMUNITY. Sclavonic races. They inhabit by preference the shores of the two seas, and the great plains which extend to the north and south of the Balkans, whilst the Turks, as liege lords of the country, dwell chiefly on the high grounds, or in the cities. This distribution dates from the conquest itself, when Mohammed II. , after the taking of Constantinople, sent military colonies into Bul garia to sill up the voids caused by emigration, and the new comers, more occupied with war than agriculture, took possession of the mountain-passes and heights looking the valleys, leaving the plains to the Greeks and Bulgarians. In general, the intermingling of the races is only perceptible in the great centres of population ; in the provinces they live entirely separate. M. Jonesco does not count a single village of mixed population among the seventy-one of the Dobrudscha. The Greeks of Syria aud Asia Minor are dispersed throughout the seaports of the Levant, from Trebizonde to Jaffa and St. Jean d'Acre. Their numbers decrease in proportion to the distance from the coast ; and beyond a certain limit they are only found in great commercial towns frequented by caravans : such as Angora, Aleppo, :cus, &c. The agricultural population consists almost exclusively of Turks, Armenians, and Kurds. The islands, on the contrary, are nearly all Greek. They form, as we have seen, two Eyalets : that of Crete, comprising three livas \u2014 Canea, Bethymos, and Candia \u2014 and twenty-one districts : and that of the Archipelago, comprising eight livas \u2014 Tenedos, Lemnos, Mitylene, Chios, Samos, Stancos, Bhodes, and Cyprus \u2014 subdivided into forty-six districts. Among these islands, Samos pos- i2"], [208, "Letter III. >. TURKEY. 172 sesses an independent internal administration, by virtue of privileges conceded by the Porte. It is exempted from other contributions by paying an annual tribute to the treasury of 40,000 piastres, and has its own flag, bearing a blue and white stripe, with a red cross. Among the immediate subjects of the Porte of Sclavonic origin, the Bulgarians hold the first rank. Their country, bisected by the Balkans, touches on the Black Sea and the Sea of Thrace, at the points of Bourgaz and Salonica, extending to Albania and Servia in the west, and follow 111\"- the course of the Danube in the north from Feti-Islam to Silistria. Some historians ascribe to them a Finnish . surrounded, however, and in immediate contact with populations of the Sclavonic race, they have gradually adopted their language, whilst their nationalities have become imperceptibly blended. They had formerly a powerful aristocracy, which has disappeared through in ternal convulsions, whilst a long subjugation has been fatal to their former martial spirit. Bobust, industrious, and inured to fatigue, they devote themselves to agri cultural labour of every kind. Their number may be computed at not less than three millions, or three times that of the Greek population of European Turkey. In considering this disproportion, we are the more struck with the ascendant acquired by the Greeks over the surrounding populations : compensating by activity for want of numerical strength, they soon monopolised all the commerce of the country, leaving the soil to be tilled by the Bulgarians, on whom they also imposed, if not their language, their religious faith. This supremacy continues to exist, so that throughout Roumelia and"], [209, "Letter III. STATISTICS OF THE i MMUNITY. 173 Bulgaria the richest commercial houses, the best-provided khans, and the most efficient schools, are possessed and directed by Greeks, and an opinion generally prevails, that where Greek influence ceases, barbarism commences ; but all fusion between the two races is rendered impossible by their mutual and inveterate antipathy. The Greeks de spise the Sclavonians, calling them barbarians and kondro kephalai (wooden-heads), as they did even in the time of Michael Pal\u00e6ologus, 1261 : on the other hand, the astute and wily spirit of the Greeks is utterly repugnant, to the Sclavonians, who regard them with jealousy and distrust. Next in order come the Servians of Bosnia and the Herzeaw ine, in number about 1,500,000, about one-third of whom are Musulmans, and the Servians of Metotria. This name is given to that portion of Albania which extends over the livas of Prezrina (the ancient capital of Servia under the king Douchan), of Prichtiua, and of Novi-Bazar. The Sclavonic population of this country may be computed at 200,000. Not far from thence, in the mountains between Novi-Bazar and Montenegro, we find another Sclavonic population, divided into four great tribes \u2014 the Hazes, the Pipari, the Vaskowikis, and the Biclopawlikis. A portion only of these half-civilised tribes is immediately subservient to the Porte ; the others are confounded with the Montenegrins, and recognise no authority but that of the Vladik'a of Cetinje. The Vlaques, or Zingaris, sometimes classed with the Greeks, sometimes with the Sclavonians, belong in reality to neither of these races. Originating, as their name indicates, in Walachia, whence they emigrated at differ-"], [210, "174 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. ent times into the southern provinces,1 they sprang, like the Walachians of the Danube, from the Roman colonies which Trajan sent into ancient Dacia. Their language, although much adulterated by importations from the sur rounding populations, still bears a resemblance to that of the Moldo-Walachians,2 and, like the latter, they take pride in the appellation of Roumouns or Roumains. The Greeks call them Vlaques, and the Sclavonians Zing. iris. A document recently published at Athens computes the number of Zingaris dispersed through Greece and the Turkish provinces of Thessaly and Macedonia at 600,000. This is probably an exaggeration, as the num ber in Turkey itself does not appear to exceed 200,000 or 220,000 individuals.

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION. 175 If we subtract from this total about 600,000 Ca tholics (Greeks, Bulgarians, Bosnians, &c.) belonging to European Turkey, we shall find that the remaining six millions will fairly represent the effective strength of the Greek community in the Ottoman empire. II. Government and Administration. Having now to examine the interior government of the community, we shall endeavour to define exactly, if pos sible, its situation with regard to the Porte, and also the authority it is called on to exercise in the management of its own affairs. Independent of the government of the Porte, which controls the Greeks like other subjects of the empire, Musulman or otherwise, we find in the bosom of the nation two distinct authorities, one established by the conquest, the other retained by it, ; namely, the central authority, represented by the synod and the patriarch, \u2014 and the local authority of the bishops and munici palities. The synod is not only a council, in a great measure permanent, established in the bosom of the Orthodox Church, to secure the integrity of the faith and the main tenance of discipline ; it forms also the great council of the nation, and deliberates on all measures of g interest, which the patriarch, as its representative at the Porte, is charged with carrying into execution. It revises judgments passed by bishops in their dioceses, regulates and distributes imposts, the amount of which is paid into the patriarchal chest, superintends schools, &c. Its"], [212, "Letter III. 176 LETTERS ON TURKEY. decisions are supreme in ecclesiastical matters ; in other they require the \" Bouiourouldou\" ofthe Porte to ensure their validity. This right of veto, however, which admits of the interference of the Porte in the internal economy of the Greeks, if some encroachment on their self-government, does not extend to legislative action in respect of measures repudiated by the synod, except only in cases anticipated by the capitulations. The following is an example : \u2014 In 1847, the Divan, on the reiterated complaints of a great number of notables, issued an ordinance, with the view of reforming the dady abuses practised in the nomination of metropolitans and bishops, and of conferring on the lay members a larger share in the administration of the commonwealth. A preliminary assembly of notables met to discuss this subject at the patriarchate some days before Easter; but the members of the clergy who were present protested energetically against all intervention of the laity in the affairs of the rchate, as being contrary to religion and to their own prerogatives at elections. The synod also rejected the formation of mixed committees, as proposed by the \" bouiourouldou,\" viz. composed of an equal number of clerical and lay members. A report of this sitting was sent, according to custom, to the Porte, but signed only by the patriarch and the twelve metropolitans of the synod. The notables declined giving their signature, and addressed a petition to the Porte, protesting against tendencies so manifestly in oppo sition to the bouiourouldou and the intentions of govern ment, and demonstrating the necessity of many reforms, of which the synod always refused to take the initiative."], [213, "Letter III. THE SYNOD. 177 One of the most radical of these was the allotment of a fixed revenue for the patriarch and bishops, aud the separation of the spiritual and temporal power, as being the only efficient remedy for abuses. The consequence was a fresh bouiourouldou from the Porte, followed by a new meeting of the synod and notables, many of whom however refused to attend. The patriarch again declined submitting to the injunctions of the Porte with regard to the intervention of the laity at elections. He professed himself ready to second the initiative of government in all other purely administrative measures indicated in the bouiourouldou, and pledged himself to promulgate shortly, in conjunction with the synod, certain regulations, re garding which he was ready to listen to the opinions of the notables, promising to take their opinions into serious consideration. A first discussion took place concerning the schools and the administration of the revenues. It was agreed to form a committee, charged with elaborating regulations on these points; other unimportant measures were adopted ; but nothing more was said of the bouiou rouldou, and affairs remained nearly in the same state as before. The Porte was deficient in firmness on this occasion, as it has been on many others, when it Las preferred to abstain from the exercise of its rights rather than appear to use violence towards its Christian subjects. Candour obliges us to add that the venality of some influential members of the divan may have frustrated the disinterested benevolence of the rest. Such methods are far from having lost their efficacy in Turkey, even in the higher departments of government ; and they are too well i 3"], [214, "Letter III. 1 TURKEY. 178 known to the patriarchate to admit of our supposing that it would hesitate to employ them when thought necessary to its interests. This weakness of the Porte (for so on either supposition it must be deemed) is a deplorable evil, and was found to be especially detrimental in the case above mentioned. Never had amore favourable opportunity presented itself for resolving to the public satisfaction this question of the patri archates \u2014 one of those which affect most deeply the future well-being of Turkey. Nothing could be more legitimate than the intervention of the government in such cases, a* it limited its initiative to taking cognisance of the appeal of a part of the nation ; nor could the right be seriously con tested, since the Porte must surely be acknowledged the protector of all its subjects, independent and irrespective of any anterior treaties or conventions. What in fact was demanded ? The separation of the temporal and spiritual power, as desired by the notables. Here there was no religious question. The Church, deprived of the temporal authority which had been conferred by the conquest, would still have retained its spiritual authority undiminished. Nothing was assailed but certain abuses, which the Greeks were the first to suffer from and to complain of, and which likewise cause serious damage to the State. On this sub ject M. Eugene Bore' writes as follows in a work published at Constantinople (1847) : \u2014 \" The patriarchs of the Milleti or Christian communities remaining invested not only with all their ecclesiastic jurisdiction, but also with a certain judicial power, which enabled them to inflict on i\\u- members of their flock fines, bastinado, and iinprison- it followed that the members of the Greek, Arme-"], [215, "Letter III. 179 SYNOD. nian, and other churches were subject to two distinct authorities. It. must be admitted also that this second authority, by abusing its prerogatives, and oppressing instead of protecting its dependents, gave rise to com plaints and accusations, which, instead of attacking those really blameworthy and responsible, were too often laid to the charge of the superior authority, itself ignorant of these excesses, and generally misconstrued as to its inten tions. Even at the present day, how many unhappy Christians, victims of this arbitrary ecclesiastical power, ignorantly and unjustly blame the State for acts perpe trated by the delegates of spiritual authority in its name, though entirely without its knowledge or concurrence ! Herein are found continual pretexts for the remonstrance and intervention of foreign powers. The only effective mode of removing the evil would be to deprive the spiritual chiefs of civil power, which tends continually to create two laws and two judicial authorities, while the State is ever proclaiming unity in both. If all matters not directly affecting religion and conscience were left to the civil tribunals, and all spiritual rulers debarred from employ ing violent and coercive measures to punish offences which God alone can judge,3 the much-coveted reign of liberty of conscience might then be established in the empire.\" * On this occasion, habitual weakness and a dread of foreign intervention deterred the Porte from acting, and the opportunity of effecting a great reform was lost.

In 1840 the English ambassador, having, in the name of his government hold ing the protectorate ofthe Ionian Islands, made reiterated complaints against the Greek patriarch for having pub lished certain writings attacking the rights of the Ionian Parliament and the dignity of the protecting power, the Porte referred the case to the council of state. An in quiry was instituted ; and after the patriarch had been repeatedly examined before it touching the nature and object of the incriminated writings, a report was drawn up, which pronounced that the patriarch had transgressed the limits of his ecclesiastical authority, by using language hostile to the government of her Britannic Majesty. This report, inserted at length in the ' Moniteur Ottoman,' was followed by an imperial rescript, dismissing the pa triarch, and inviting the synod and primates of the nation to proceed immediately to the nomination of his suc cessor.1' Constituted as at present, the patriarchate is a per petual focus of discords and intrigues.

Nothing was talked of throughout the Fanar but the approaching disgrace of the grand Logothetis, when a few days later, to the general surprise, a vizirial letter appeared, declaring the accusation of the synod ground less, and commanding several of its members, who were regarded as the principal instigators of the accusation, to quit Constantinople and repair to their dioceses. Among these were the metropolitans of Nicomedia, Cyzicum, Bosnia, and Sophia. It was evident that this measure, considered apart from the motives that dictated it, con stituted an abuse of government power, and an encroach ment on the administrative independence of the nation, as recognised by the khatti-she'rifs of Mohammed II. and his successors ; but whom have the Greeks to blame but themselves for these violations of their privileges ? Had not internal rivalries and the ambition of parties caused them to seek its intervention, the Turkish government would never have interfered in the affairs of the patri archate : and as it was, it simply profited by an occasion offered to it ; nor must we wonder if its course under such circumstances was arbitrary, nor attribute to it a systematic design of withdrawing all power into its own hands.

The elements of this change are however within reach. They may be found in existing institutions, and only require a more extended development : it is of these that we are about to speak. Municipalities. Municipal organisation in Turkey is^of very ancient date : it is common to the Osmanlis, and to the greater part of the tributary races, as the Greeks, Bulgarians, Armenians, Israelites, &c. The former borrowed it from the Arabs, amongst whom it had existed from time imme morial, as a consequence of the system of direct taxation established by the Koran. The Ayans of Arabia and the tribes of Barbary, presiding at the assessment of the taxes and the levying of tithes, bore a close resemblance by the nature of their functions to the kodja-bachis of Turkey ; in the same way as the latter resemble the mayors of the communes in France. Analogous institutions existed in the Low-er Empire, especially where Boman colonies had settled ; these appear to us to be a remnant of the muni cipal institutions brought from Italy, or perhaps of the self-governing cities of ancient Greece. Such facts were however of a transitory nature, peculiar to certain locali ties, and without fixed basis or legal guarantee, until the conquest generalised the system, by making the munici palities at once a method and a principle of government. We have seen that the Turks treated with each nation, or rather with each church, as with a body corporate, to which they conceded a certain power of self-government, in order to secure its obedience more firmly, and at the same time"], [219, "1' III.

Sometimes indeed the patriarchs were compelled to advance the required amount, and look to their flocks for reimbursement. In those days of violence and trouble the impost was very different from what we now see it under an equitable and regular government. Apart from the extortions of pashas and governors, the ordinary and legal tribute was aggravated by various extraordinary impositions, sanc tioned by custom. Demands were perpetually made for forage and provisions to be furnished for the troops, or for government agents and all travellers of distinction bear ing bou'iourouldous : loans were exacted in kind, or boun ties to obtain exemption from the statute labour obliga tion.7 These irregular demands fell chiefly on the distant provinces, they being most exposed to the rapa city cf governors and government subordinates. The necessity of apportioning these tributes to the resources of individuals induced towns and villages to associate for the purpose, by which means a multitude of small communi ties were gradually formed in the bosom of the great community ; and from Dacia and the Danubian provinces, ' Gorve'e was the term used under the old French regime to designate such compulsory labour; it has no equivalent in our language, though the thing itself existed, and was most rigorously enforced by the English protectors in the Ionian Islands, as the peasants, especially those of Ce phalonia, sadly experienced. \u2014 T."], [220, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. 184 where it earliest flourished, the system extended itself to all the tributary territories. If we except certain localities which had submitted to the conquest under special conditions, and some which at later periods had obtained special immunities from the Porte, we shall find these municipal organisations every where nearly uniform. The Porte lent a willing aid to the establishment of the system, its great and immediate advantages being apparent, whilst its latent evils had not yet disclosed themselves. Ottoman domination in fact, however apparently des potic, has nothing of that arbitrary spirit which seeks to reduce all to a common level. Whilst European govern ments, of whatever form, impelled by that mania for centralisation which they have set up as a rule, reserve to themselves exclusively the execution of political and administrative laws, and aim at an amalgamation of interests and social relations, with a reckless disregard of discrepancies of manners, opinions, and even us local cir cumstances, the Turkish government has always reserved its power for a higher sphere of action, leaving subordi nate interests to be controlled by the separate exigencies of each district. Such was the origin of municipal corporations in Turkey. Their organisation presents at once great simplicity and great uniformity ; but a distinction must be drawn be tween the municipalities of villages and those of cities. The former are composed of primates, designated by the names of proesti, protoyeri, demogerontes, procritis, &c, according to the localities. At their head is the kodja-bachi, a sort of official delegate of the village."], [221, "Letter III.

The mode of conduct ing the election has already been mentioned in a former letter.8 The functions of the primates are wholly gra tuitous ; as for the kodja-bachi, although he receives no fixed stipend, he nas certain privileges which enable him to improve his own means while serving the general interests. In some districts, particularly in Thessaly, he receives a small salary as an indemnity for the time he devotes to public business, and which varies in amount from 300 to 1000 piastres. The duties of the kodja-bachis, as chiefs of the municipalities, are considerably more numerous than those of our mayors,9 as they are at once receivers, administra tors, and judges. One of their principal duties is the collection of the kharadj (capitation tax) : great abuses having prevailed in former times under the Turkish collectors (kharadji), a decree of Sultan Mahmoud in 1834 relative to this mat ter relieved the ra'iahs from whatever was exorbitant and oppressive in the capitation tax, and gave fresh import ance to the municipalities, weakened by the feudal abuses which that Sultan so vigorously assailed.

A new ordinance, June, 1850, confirmed and completed the previous measure, by determining that the collection of the poll-tax should be effected in every province by the primates only, it being their further duty to consign the amount to the patriarchate, whence it is paid into the imperial treasury. The kodja-bachis and the primates are jointly intrusted with the administration of the revenues and expenses of the municipal district, including the interest of the public debt, the maintenance of the village school and church, and the pay or salaries of the officiating clergy. Amongst all these charges the last mentioned is one of the most con siderable. From numerous facts collected and collated by M. Jonesco, and published in 1853 in his 'Excursion agricole en Thessalir,' it appears that the average amount of this impost paid to the church in the province of Thes saly exceeds that of the kharadj paid to the state by the Christian populations. For instance, the village of Parie tes, in the vale of Tempe, with a population of 529 inhabitants, pays to the church a sum total of 7035 piastres, which amounts on an average to rather more than two shillings and sixpence per head, including the children.1 This multiplied by 6,000,000 (the number at which we have reckoned the Greek population in Turkey) gives 18,000,000 of francs (720,000/.), an enormous sum 1 The priests scarcely receive a fourth of this sum, the greater part being absorbed by the bishops and their retainers, besides the monasteries."], [223, ".

It is his duty likewise to attend to the civil registration of his district Fie draws up annually a report of the births and deaths which take place within his jurisdiction ; this he transmits to the bishop, with whom he is constantly in communication, and the bishop transmits it to Constantinople. The verification of these reports is made in the offices of the patriarchate, and a duplicate is sent to the Porte. These documents, however, become of very little value in the way of general statistics, because, the annual contribution which the bishops are obliged to furnish to the patriarch being in pro portion to the number of families in their several dioceses, they are accustomed to make their returns fall short of the reality. Finally, the kodja-bachis have a power of arbi trating between litigants, in cases where parties prefer their jurisdiction to that of the cadi or bishop. Should the case be referred to Turkish tribunals, these latter pronounce judgment, and cause it to be executed by the primates. Moreover, the kodja-bachi intervenes as ad ministrative officer in most transactions between individuals, by drawing up contracts, legalising signatures and bargains, affixing seals on the property of the deceased, &c. Such is the general and nearly uniform aspect of the Greek municipalities in Boumelia and Bulgaria, in Asia Minor, and the islands. With occasional diversities in form, the principle on which they are based is every where the same ; embodying the right of self-govern ment originally conceded to the raiahs, and forming a"], [224, "OS TURKEY. Letter III. 188 counterpoise to the administrative authority. In cer tain localities, in fact, the latter became entirely super seded by the operation of peculiar privileges freely conferred by the Porte, and which in some cases are not limited to single villages or towns, but embrace whole districts \u2014 as formerly in Kydonia,2 and in Zagoria at the present day. The district of Zagoria, in the liva of Yanina, is well described by a writer in the ' Quarterly Review,' whose words we venture to borrow. \" To the east of the Lake of Yanina, in the midst of the dark mountains of Pindus, there is a small district broken into a thousand deep chasms and frowning preci pice-; in its fastnesses numerous Greek families took refuge on the fall of the Byzantine empire, but they sub mitted to the Musulman conquerors without provoking an assault, receiving in return a guarantee that their civil privileges and religious rites should be for ever respected, and that no Musulman should settle among them. The Greeks of Zagoria have since formed a kind of inde pendent republic, under the protection of the Porte. Forty-four villages, containing about 25,000 inhabitants, are dispersed amongst its ravines and rocks. Each vil lage elects a primate, whose duty is to collect the taxes, to communicate with the vakeel,* or chief primate; and, assisted by the principal villagers or elders of the com munity (' gerondes,' ycgovTEr4), to watch over the interests of the population. The vakeel is elected by the votes of the whole district, to represent their interests, and act 2 See page SO. 3 Vake-ol or kodja-bachi; the office is the same. 4 In the district of Zagoria these magistrates are called protooritis."], [225, "189 Letter III. \\GUKIOTES. as their agent at the divan of the Pasha of Yanina, at which latter place he resides : this officer is elected for six months, by two representatives from each village de puted for the purpose. They meet at Yanina, examine the accounts of the previous vakeel, sign them if correct, and name his successor. The new vakeel takes an oath to maintain inviolate, to the best of his power, the privi leges and liberties granted by different sultans. It is his special duty to communicate with the pasha on all busi ness connected with the district which he represents, and especially as to the amount of taxes ; to take means to have those taxes paid, when due, to the proper authori ties : to investigate all disputes between the inhabitants of Zagoria, to adjudicate in them, and to see to the execution of the decrees which he may pronounce. The privileges thus conferred upon the Zagoriotes have been faithfully respected by the Turkish government, and their territory has remained inviolate, except when a rebellious Albanian chief may have carried his marauding expedi tion into their tranquil villages. The district is too rocky and barren to admit of much cultivation, and its inhabit ants have not engaged in commerce and manufactures like those of Ambelakia formerly, but they have carefully educated their children and fitted them for holding places of great trust and responsibility. Each village has its schools of mutual instruction, and many also a second school on the common system. In the year 1840 there were 3958 children of both sexes receiving instruction, out of a population of about 25,000 (i. e. about one sixth). \"After leaving the schools the youths usually seek their"], [226, "Letter III. 190 LETTERS ON TURKEY. fortunes in various parts of Turkey, in the Danubian pro vinces, or in those European ports which trade with the Levant, and become lawyers, merchants, or teachers. After a few years of successful industry they return to their native villages, marry, reside a limited period with their families, again seek occupation abroad, and visit their homes at distant intervals, until they finally retire from active life and settle in Zagoria to finish their days. The traveller in Albania, after traversing some of its wildest districts, is surprised to find himself suddenly in the midst of a highly civ'dised community, to see around him spacious and elegantly-furnished houses, and to be accosted by men of refined manners, speaking more than one European tongue. The women of Zagoria, too, are remarkable, to a proverb, for their beauty. We speak of Zagoria 5 as it was some eleven years ago ; we know not what Greek intrigue may have made it since.'

In Turkey, especially, it is dangerous to draw general conclusions from particular facts ; since uo country presents such constantly recurring exceptions to what, appears to be the rule. A disposition to generalise has been the source of numerous errors respecting Turkey on the part of writers in other respects accurate. How often have the mu nicipalities departed from the character and object of their institution, and become to the unfortunate raiahs a source of oppression far more grinding than the oppres sion of the Osmanlis ! In Greece, particularly, they had given rise to a species of aristocracy which vexed the whole country by its exactions ; and, when the war of independence broke out, it was precisely the struggle between this aristocracy and the mass of the population that engendered political divisions and retarded so long the emancipation of the country. A countryman of Mr. Urquhart's,7 the historian of the Greek Bevolution, draws a lamentable picture of the oppression, rapacity, and intriguing spirit of the kodja bachis and primates in Greece proper, forming a remark able contrast with the disinterested patriotism that Air. Urquhart ascribes to them in Boumelia and Bulgaria. Perhaps also the latter author pushes his enthusiasm too far in attributing te the municipalities not only the conservation of Christian races in Turkey, but even the 7 See Gordon's History ofthe Greek Revolution."], [228, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. 192 duration of the Ottoman empire itself; and in opining that the most powerful instrument of Turkish reorganiza tion would be the elevation of the Greeks to higher political importance. It must be remembered that the municipal system is by no means the exclusive heritage ofthe Greeks; and that the Ottomans are endowed with an administrative capacity superior to that of any of their Christian subjects. I have already noticed this truth, which is admitted by all writers who have studied the history and institutions of Turkey. We shall now proceed to examine the municipalities of cities, between which and those of the rural districts there is a great similarity. At Constantinople, Smyrna, in all the trading ports of the Levant, and the cities of the interior, each principal quarter inhabited by Greeks forms one or more parishes ; every parish has its magistrates or ephores chosen by the inhabitants, whose functions have been already described. The number of Greek parishes or municipalities at Constantinople is fifty-four, namely, twenty-two within the walls, four in the suburbs of Galata and Pera, and the remainder in the scattered villages which skirt the Golden Horn and both shores of the Bosphorus, from San Stefano and Kadi-keni as far as the Black Sea. Some of these villages, as well as certain quarters of Con stantinople, are inhabited almost entirely by Greeks ; such are Therapia, Princes' Islands, Psammatia, the Fanar, &c. Nevertheless, the whole population does not exceed 80,000 souls ; which gives an average of 1600 inhabitants to each parish. The ephores are generally three in number \u2014 an admi-"], [229, "Letter III. 193 THE EPHORES. nistrator, a kiatib or secretary, and a treasurer. They are elected annually, like the primates of villages, by the universal suffrage of the inhabitants, an ephimerios of the patriarch confirming the election. Their duties are also very similar, and comprise the levying of the kharadj, the superintendence of schools and hospitals, the administration of the funds of the district, and the care of the registers of the civil state But their duties are almost a nullity in a judicial point of view, the majority of cases being brought before the bishop's divan or the mixed tribunals of commerce. Mr. Urquhart, instituting a comparison between the urban and rural municipalities at the time that he wTote, and being struck with the difference in the apparent results, endeavours to explain it by the system of direct impost prevalent in the cities. True it is that the farming of the kharadj and other imposts, the levying of the ihticjab and customs-dues by the agents of government, and all those institutions borrowed from fiscal science in Europe, which replace the direct impost of rural communes, exercise a pernicious influence over the urban municipal bodies, by rendering them more accessible to corruption, and de priving them of their most important and responsible function : at the present day, however, circumstances are no longer the same ; recent reforms, and the creation of medjlis (or provincial councils), wherein the delegates sit by turns as administrative and judicial authorities, tend ing every day to enhance the dignity and credit of urban municipalities.

K"], [230, "LETTERS ON TURKEY Letter III. 194 Most of the schools throughout Turkish Greece are annexed or subsidiary to the churches. Amongst the Turks we everywhere find the mcdresse and imaret in juxtaposition to the mosque ; religion, charity, and science being inseparable in the eye of Musulman piety ; but it was no analogous idea that originally suggested the conversion of the vestibules of churches and the cloisters of monasteries into primary schools, where children might be taught their alphabet and catechism gratuitously. The Greeks, if we are to believe their own historians, in placing their schools under the shadow of the sanctuary, had no object but that of protecting Christian education from Turkish persecution in the former days of fanaticism and intolerance. There can be no doubt that in certain localities the violence and rapacity of individual pashas may have forced the municipalities to have recourse to this expedient : but that Ottoman persecution was \u25a0 \\ i-v general, or systematically acted upon by the ruling power, cannot be admitted with so many facts to the contrary related by the Greeks themselves. Apart, how ever, from the contradictions and exaggerations into which Greek narrators are too easily betrayed, it must be admitted that times are greatly changed ; and that when we find Greek professors haranguing from their professorial seats against the government, aud openly making their lectures the vehicle of sedition, we need no other fact to convince us how far we are from those days when the chief dragomans Panayoti and Mav rocordato found it necessary to disguise their schools of science and literature under the title of \" houses of correction. \" To return to the schools at present existing in Turkish"], [231, "III.

I visited several of them at Pera, Scutari, and Princes' Islands, in company with a Greek of Andros, who, like many of his fellow-countrymen, had embraced the professorial career. They scarcely differed from those which I saw a year after in Bulgaria and Macedonia ; and one may serve as a sample of all the rest. The first object that struck me on entering was a portrait of the Emperor of Bussia, placed opposite to a painting of the Saviour. This fact is general in Turkey. M. Font. charged by the French government with a scientific mis sion to Armenia and other parts of Asia Minor during the years 1826 and 1827, remarks it often in the course of his narrative, and especially on the occasion of a visit paid by him to the Armenian bishop of Erzeroum. \" The bishop,\" says he, \" inhabited a very fine monastery. I found him occupied in instructing a great number of children ; the schoolroom was a vast apartment, deco rated, according to custom, with portraits of the Emperor and Empress of Bussia, whom the orthodox are led to consider their legitimate sovereigns.\" In the middle of the room I perceived a group of chil dren sitting, or rather squatting, ou the floor, around the didaskalos, or teacher. This latter is usually a deacon, waiting for his ordination to the priesthood, though the office is sometimes filled by a layman. Natives of Kydonia, Yanina, and the islands of the Grecian archi pelago, frequently earn a subsistence in this way at Con stantinople. The schoolmaster is remunerated by the ephores, who allow him a monthly salary of 200 to 250 piastres.

But here ends the instruction : there were no other books, either of history, geography, orthography, or grammar. This kind of estabbshment, dignified with the name of school, is little more than an asylum where the poor inhabitants of the commune send their children as soon as they are able to totter, in order to have leisure themselves to attend to their other affairs. The schools are in general very numerously attended, and this alone might be an obstacle to instruction, if any serious benefit could be looked for from institutions left entirely to themselves, and uncon trolled either by the local administration or by the pro fessors charged with public education.

In the provinces the amount of elementary instruction varies in different places, but there is no permanent sys tem. On the whole, however, we may. assert that the schools are more numerous, and more frequented, in Turkey in Europe and the islands than in Turkey in Asia. In Macedonia and Thessaly no village is without its school ; the master being more or less liberally remu nerated, according to the circumstances of the inhabitants. If the village is too poor to have a didaskalos, the class is held by the papas (priest), to whom a slight compensation is allotted for his extra trouble.

The seminary is placed under the control of ephores chosen from among the notables and the most respectable archons ; but their superintendence is purely nominal, and their intervention is limited to the choice of a professor, who is generally some scholar, loyhiotatos* whom they happen to have reasons for patronising, his qualifications for the important trust being a secondary question, or altogether a matter of indifference ; as to the director of the seminary, he only seeks to make a profit out of the sum allotted for an assistant, and therefore prefers the one who will accept the smallest salary. Not that men of merit are never to be found in these situations, but they are rare. I have known several who, by their own account, had passed some years in France, and attended our classes with assiduity, but, though their pretensions were greater, they had not more real knowdedge than their colleagues from Yanina, or the great school of the Fanar.

The last of these brothers, whose hearts were truly of antique mould, died in 1842, and his funeral oration wTas pronounced by a distinguished scholar and theologian, Constantine \u0152conomos. The great school of Yanina,4 fostered by the bro thers Zosimados, soon attained the first rank among the Grecian schools. Celebrated men gave instruction there \u2014 Lambros Photiadis, who was subsequently sum moned (1795) to the chair of polite literature in the College of Bucharest ; Psallidas, a disciple of Kant, author of a treatise on moral philosophy, entitled ' Vera Felicitas,' in Greek and Latin ; Michael Christens, of threefold celebrity as physician, professor, and patriot The famous Ali Pasha of Yanina, at the zenith of his power, of his tyranny, and his exactions, respected the 4 The most, ancient of the Grecian schools, founded by the learned Ralano in 1760."], [237, "!

This also was the secret motive of Mehemet Ali in endowing Egypt with so many scien tific and literary establishments, few of which have sur vived him. At the present day, however, education at Yanina is in a most deplorable state. The 300,000 francs derived from the munificence of the brothers Zosimados scarcely suffice to maintain four or five elementary schools, and one superior gymnasion, which will not bear com parison with the most humble of the common \" classical \" schools in England or France. The greater part of the above-named revenue, administered by a commission of notables under the presidency of the bishop, instead of serving, as the founders intended, for the liberal remune ration of professors, for the formation and support of libraries, and providing the schools with every requisite and advantage, is employed in supporting the bishop him self and his party against the pretensions and intrigues of the opposing faction, and in gaming adherents in the bosom of the synod. These abuses became so great even in the lifetime of the Zosimadis, that the last survivor bequeathed the residue of his own and his brothers' fortune to the university of Athens, instead of his native city ; and re cently, when the principal inhabitants of Yanina formed a subscription, founding an academy for the education of their youth, they decided that it should be established not at Yanina itself, but a few leagues distant, in the territory of Zagoria. Nor was this abuse an isolated fact ; we find the same k 3"], [238, "202 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. cause everywhere contributing to the decline of schools in Turco-Greece. Adrianople and Salonica also possessed lyceums (or colleges; more or less richly endowed. These lyceums, alas ! which formerly maintained several hundred students, who were instructed, boarded, lodged, and clothed gratuitously, now serve only as a refuge for sixty or eighty needy scholars, obliged to provide their own subsistence. Confined to their narrow cells, their life resembles that of the soft is in the Musulman medresses. Some of these receive a small allowance from their families ; others obtain subsistence and clothing as they can, by performing menial services, generally about the residence or person of the bishop. We must now examine what may be called the hish education, which is placed under the immediate charge of the patriarch. There are but two establishments devoted to this branch, both of them tolerably flourishing \u2014 the seminary of Khalki and the Patriarchal seminary. The seminary of Khalki, annexed to the monastery of the Holy Trinity, has fifteen professors, clergy and lay men, and seventy or eighty students. The instruction is gratuitous, and comprises Latin, philosophy, and mathe matics, besides theology and the Hellenic Greek. This establishment, the only one of its kind in the whole empire, furnishes annually to the church about fifty mem bers, more enlightened and probably less corrupt than the mass of the Greek clergy ; but what can the moral in fluence of this small number effect amidst the swarm of priests and caloyers, who, sunk in ignorance and sloth, encumber the one hundred and fifty-three eparchies (dioceses) of Turkish Greece?"], [239, "III. SCHOOL OF THE PATRIARCHATE. 203 The school of the patriarchate (patriarchiki scholi), in the Fanar, is in fact the ancient school of Kourou-tchesme, on the Bosphorus. It was founded about the year 1799 by Demetrius Morousi. grand dragoman to the Porte under Selim III., who devoted to its support the revenues of two rich domains in of which his brother Alexander was Hospodar. It acquired great celebrity by its chair of philosophy, successively filled by Dorotheus Pro'ius, of Chio, afterwards metropolitan of Adrianople, where he perished at the beginning of the revolution of 1821 ; by Plato, his countryman, who was associated in the compilation of the great dictionary of Coray ; by Stephen Doukas, of Tournovo, in Thessaly, who was after wards archimandrite of the metropolitan church of Jassy and prior of the abbey of Bochitessa in Moldavia ; and finally by Coumas, who translated Tenneman's ' Manuel de Philosophic' Like the other Grecian schools, that of Kourou-tchesme suffered greatly in consequence of the revolution of 1821. Its founder, Demetrius Morousi, was beheaded at Choumla in 1812, accused of having betrayed the confidence of his master, and sacrificed the interests of the Porte by giving up Bessarabia to the Bussians ; his brother Alexander was, in 1802, deprived for the second time of his post of hospodar, and replaced by Michel Soutzo ; whilst the last of this illustrious family, Constantine Morousi, denounced as a secret agent of the Hetairists, was, as we have already seen, ohe of the first victims to Musulman vengeance in the insurrection of 1821.

Being at once a normal school aud one for the high education, the school of the Fanar is endowed with four professorships of Greek and foreign literature, one of philosophy, one of history, and two of science, and it also educates professors for the whole em pire. The students, from one hundred to one hundred and twenty in number, receive instruction, board, and lodging, gratuitously, except a few, who provide for their own ex penses. The school is administered by four ephores \u2014 two of them archbishops and two layinen \u2014 whose duty it is to superintend the general education, to fill up the professorships as they become vacant, to administer the revenues, estimated at four or five thousand ducats, to control the expenses, &c. Of all the existing schools of Turco-Greece, this is the only one that has hitherto produced any results worth speaking of. Amongst the present professors I have pleasure in citing the name of a man of real merit, M. Constantine Euthyboulis, known by his fine translation of the philosophical works of Cousin. He aud M. Constantine Typaldos, directeur of the semi nary of Khalki, are perhaps the two men most dis tinguished by ability and merit in the ranks of the professors. I have already indicated some of the causes that have led to the decline of the Greek schools. The principal and most destructive was the revolution of 1821, which occa sioned the closing of the great schools of Patmos, Kydonia, Chios, Smyrna, and Mount Athos ; some of which had begun to rival the universities of Germany and Italy."], [241, "Letter III. DECLINE OF GREEK SCHOOLS. 205 Another cause was the formation of the new kingdom of Greece, which attracted the intellectual movement from Constantinople to Athens. The number and talents of her professors, her juxtaposition to Western Europe, and the literary ardour of her recently emancipated students, have combined to render Athens what she was in the time of Pericles \u2014 the centre of Greek civilisation. Nowhere is the intellectual activity, which has always been the characteristic feature of the Hellenic race, so strikingly displayed.5 One of the first monuments that meets the eye, on entering the city, is the University, placed between the king's palace, which resembles a large barrack, and the chamber of deputies. The language in common use is no longer the corrupt dialect, disfigured with Turkish and Italian phrases, which grates on the ear in the streets of Constantinople, Smyrna, or Chios, but a polished and refined idiom, little differing from the classic tongue. Therefore we find that the great families of Con- stantinople and other Turkish cities no longer send their children to Odessa, Marseilles, or Leghorn, but prefer Athens as a place of instruction. Three-fourths at least of the works that are annually published in modern Greek are the produce of Hellenic presses, whilst the eight presses of Constantinople publish little more than paraphrases or translations of our most popular French romances, such as the ' Comte de Monte-Christo,' which was the favourite reading of the inhabitants of the Fanar in 1847.

Greek schools in Turkey : I mean the seminaries opened in the chief towns of the empire by the Lazarist mission aries. It is very certain that the number of the schools founded by the Lazarists, with the assistance ofthe \" Filles de St. Vincent de Paul'' and the \" Freres de la Doctrine Chre'tienne\" (Brothers of Christian teaching), increases yearly in a remarkable degree. In 1849, at Constan tinople, the latter were gratuitously instructing nearly six hundred children in their schools of Pera and Galata. In the same localities, and at Bebek, instruction was similarly bestowed on seven hundred young girls in the houses of the Sisters of Charity, who also maintained at Galata a school of one hundred and sixty pupils, all living in the establishment, which was so managed that fifty indigent orphans were supported out of the funds derived from those pupils who paid for education. In the same year, at Smyrna, the schools ofthe \"Freres\" contained more than three hundred pupils, not including the adult classes; whilst sixty boarders and three hundred day-scholars were educated by the sisters. At Damascus also there were two schools frequented by four hundred and fifty children of both sexes. At Beyrout, Salonica, Aleppo, and wher ever the Lazarist missions extend, hundreds of children of all creeds receive elementary instruction freely and gratuitously. Education of a higher class is given by the Lazarist fathers in person, and has been no less diligently pur sued : their college at Bebek contains above eighty resi dent pupils of every nation, and may compete, in point of study, with the educational establishments in France, to which it was assimilated by a royal ordinance promul-"], [243, "Letter III. LAZARIST SEMINARIES. 207 gated during the reign of Louis Philippe. Besides a foundation of French and Latin the pupils are taught Turkish, Greek, and Italian \u2014 the three languages most generally used in the East. The cost of education at the college of Bebek is very moderate, the establishment, not being founded for pur poses of emolument but of civilization and beneficence. The professors are men of talents and learning, and the site of the building, in a charming village on the European shore of the Bosphorus, is both agreeable and salubrious. The Franks of Pera and Galata mostly send their children there to receive their education. Three other establish ments of the sort exist in Turkey : that of the Propa ganda, at Smyrna, under the direction of the congre gation of Picpus, having eighty day-pupils and as many boarders ; that of Angora (the ancient Ancyra), in Asia Minor, founded by M. Bore, now apostolic prefect at Constantinople ; and the college of Antoura, in Syria, which contains seventy-five pupils. By means of such institutions, which improve and multiply every year, clas sical attainments, which formerly had to be sought at a great distance and expense, have been placed within the reach of all, and contribute by their influence to cement the much-desired alliance of the Eastern nations with Western Europe. To ensure the success of their enterprise, the Lazarist fathers have qualified themselves for imparting instruction to Greek children in their own tongue, and many of them now speak and write modern Greek fluently and correctly, aided thereto by their previous studies. From their great printing establishment at the central mission of St. Bene-"], [244, "208 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. diet, at Galata, a considerable number of elementary books of piety and education for the use of the schools in the Levant are annually sent forth, edited and frequently composed by the fathers. Amongst these may be men tioned the Lives of Photius and of Michael Cerularius by M. Bore, and the Franco-Greek vocabulary by Father Daviers. This press also published controversial works in the French, Latin, English, Italian, Greek, Armenian, Turkish, and Persian languages, the object being either to confirm the Boman Catholic population of Turkey in their faith, or to repel the attacks and calumnies with which the Greek Church unsparingly assails its rivals and opponents. But none of the causes of decline just enumerated can reasonably be laid to the charge of the Turco-Greek schools themselves. It is not their fault if the same revolution that emancipated the Hellenes had such disastrous con sequences for them ; nor if the moral and intellectual vitality of the nation gradually receded from the ancient capital of the Byzantine C\u00e6sars, to invigorate resuscitated Athens; nor if the Lazarist missionaries trespassed on their domain ; nor if the Turks themselves, by their literary and scientific establishments \u2014 as the colleges of Galata-Serai and Valide-Sultene' \u2014 which are open to all subjects ofthe empire, contributed towards the decay ofthe national establishments. To these causes, in a great mea sure external, others were added, which proceeded from the Greeks themselves, and arose from defective organisa tion\u2014from the dilapidation of the revenues\u2014 from the in secure tenure of the professorships\u2014 and from the want of active superintendence on the part of the central adminis-"], [245, "Letter III.

In liberty of teaching ? You possess it to an extent which exists nowhere else in Europe, either in Germany, England, or France. You are responsible to no one. The government neither de mands nor dictates your course of instruction ; you may say and teach what you choose. All that is required of you (and even this has not long been the case) is, that your schools should not become nurseries of Bussian or Hel lenic propagandism, and that education in your hands should not foment discontent and troubles in the state.6 Employ, then, all your available resources, aud, instead of abusing your rivals, strive at least to equal, if you cannot surpass them ; render yourselves worthy of your mission by your science and your character, and let the nation in 6 In 1849 serious disturbances took place at the school of Kourou tchesme, touching the question of Hellenism.

By such means you will restore your schools to their pristine splendour; their deserted halls will soon be refilled; you will arrest the progress of Boman Catholic opinions : and you will thus vindicate at once your language, your creed, and your national existence. Public Establishments. One consequence of the extension of the municipal system amono the Greeks has been, that they possess no public national establishments, strictly so called. Each locality, forming a body distinct from the great com munity, administers its own affairs, and provides for its own wants. The national or public chest (ro y.otvov) is charged only with the general expenses of the patri archate, and the only establishments at Constantinople that can be considered as belonging- to the nation are the Patriarchal School, and the great hospital of Baloukli ; . though not aided by the state, are placed under its protection, aud are appropriated to the public service. The great hospital of Baloukli, situated near the church of the same name, consists of three establishments, dis tinct in their objects though forming one building ; namely, \u2022in hospital for aged men, one for the sick and infirm, and one for insane persons. The establishment is administered by eight ephores chosen by the general assembly, to which they submit an annual report of their administration. It"], [247, "211 Letter III. CLASSIFICATION OF THE POPULATION. enjoys a revenue of about two huudred thousand piastres, partly furnished by the church, the rest being derived from property situated at Galata, on the site of the old hospital. The old hospital has been converted into khans and magazines, which are let by the administration to private individuals. From the foregoing account it appears that the schools at present existing in Constantinople and the suburbs are as follows : \u2014 Primary or Elementary Education, thirty-eight ; of which two, viz. at Orta-Kou and at Buyukdere, are on the system of mutual instruction. Schools of Supei-ior or (as it is sometimes called) \" Secondary\"' Education, twenty ; of these eight are in the city, the rest dispersed through the suburbs. Classical Schools, Lyceums, or Colleges, established and supported by private individuals, three ; viz. one at Pera, one at Galata, one at Kalki. The num- bers receiving education in these are reckoned from one hundred and eighty to two hundred. All the pupils reside in the house. Seminaries for the education of the clergy, two ; viz. one at Kalki, and the Patriarchal School or Seminary, formerly the College of Korou-tchesme. Classification of the Population. We will now, in conclusion, take a survey of the different classes of the Greek population at Constantinople and in the provinces. The orthodox clergy have already been sufficiently noticed.

Letter III. 212 an order in the state, few traces now remain He who visits for the first time the quarter of the Fanar, and notices its crooked streets and painted wooden houses of gloomy aspect, is tempted to ask whether he really sees before him the abodes of those Greek princes of Constantinople who wielded the influence of Turkey when her weight in the scale of European affairs was so con siderable. Disappointment is increased by the first aspect of the interior ; the vestibules, staircases, and courts appear to have been in a filthy state of neglect even before the splendour of the Fanar began to decline. It is only when we reach the upper stories that we find relics of frescoes, mosaics, marbles, and rich sculptures, attesting the magnificence of the former owners, and still bearing recent traces of their former princely occupants. By this contrast the past and present are simultane ously revealed. We perceive that the apparent penury was intended to baffle the cupidity and elude the ra pacious scrutiny of the Turks ; and whilst humility and neglect were conspicuous in the outside of the houses and in the ground-floors abandoned to domestics, the interior apartments, withdrawn from the eye of curi osity, and overlooking delightful gardens, resembled in luxurious magnificence the palaces of the Arabian Tales. Here it was that the wealthy Fanariots, on returning from the Divan, abandoned themselves to the pleasures of the kief,' or meditated their intrigues in tranquil security ; here, reclining on sofas, clothed in sumptuous vestments and golden stuffs which ancient sumptuary 7 Kief, a word which can hardly be rendered, unless by the Italian \" dolce far niente.\""], [249, "Latter III.

The revolution of 1821 put an end to this prosperity, and was the signal for a general dispersion of the Fanariote nobility. Some individuals, early compromised in the plot, had anticipated the explosion by secret flight ; the remainder, who were happy enough to escape the first -ought refuge in foreign countries. The family of Hypsilantis continued to live at Odessa, where they had resided since 1807. A branch of the Mavrocordato family had long since settled at Moscow. Alexander Mavrocordato, the head of the other branch, took up arms in the Greek cause, and was soon placed at the head of the new provisional government of Greece. The Soutzo and Caradja families withdrew to Austria, which country they afterwards quitted for Athens. Many in dividuals who had penetrated the designs of the Hetairia, without active participation in them, followed their ex ample, finding that the Turks made no distinctions in the objects of their hatred and vengeance. The storm, however, blew over ; the exiles recovered their palaces, but neither their former occupations nor their former influence. The posts of grand interpreter and dragoman of the arsenal were now filled by Turks ; the Danubian principalities, on regaining their ancient right of nominating their own princes, had voted the total ex clusion of the Fanariotes ; and their political importance was thenceforth lost in that quarter. Thus deprived of"], [250, "214 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. the only career ever opened to their ambition, they se cluded themselves in their houses, there to enjoy retire ment, as well they might, amidst the relics of their former wealth. Being still archons, or ephores, in right of their descent, they occupied themselves now in intrigues about the nomination or deposition of an archbishop, as formerly about the office of dragoman or hospodar. Some, who had fled to foreign countries, continued to reside there, or returned to Constantinople as the agents or representatives of the states that had afforded them protection. One of these was Prince Alexander Handjeri, who during ten years filled the post of first interpreter of the Bussian Legation at Constantinople. Many who had retained considerable property and family connections in the Danubian principalities returned to dwell on their estates, and became confounded with the. in digenous Boyars. A son of Prince Charles Callimachi, who had emigrated to Bussia after the murder of his father and uncle ; Caradja, son of the former Hospodar of Moldavia . and Vogorides, afterwards named by the Porte Prince of Samos \u2014 were the only members of the old Fanariote nobility who returned to Turkey after the death of Mah moud, and succeeded in obtaining employment \u2014 some in the Ottoman embassies, others as kapou-kiaialeri, or representatives of the Princes of Walachia and Moldavia, at Constantinople.8 It would seem that the Turks, notwithstanding their mistrust of the Greeks, have been impelled in all times 8 The hospodars of Walachia, Moldavia, and Servia, and also the governors of certain provinces and cities, enjoy the privilege of having permanent agents in the capital, who watch over their interests."], [251, "Letter III. 215 THE NOBILITY. by a certain fatality to avail themselves of their services. It may be also that the Porte, having proclaimed the charter of Gul-Khane under the influence of European ideas, has in some measure yielded to a fear of compro mising its rising reputation for liberality, by excluding the rai'ahs from the higher offices of state at the very moment that it was abolishing the qualification of ra'iah, and admitting equality of civil rights. This fear, which recently has more than once led the policy of the Divan astray, was listened to rather than the murmurings and mistrust of a part of its subjects, and even at the present day we find the most important posts of Turkish diplomacy filled by Greeks, as at London, and lately at Paris. But neither the employments occasionally con fided to members of the old families, nor the title of Bey ('sometimes improperly translated Prince)9 which they generally assume, nor any of the other situations of profit or authority with which they may happen to be tem porarily invested, can properly constitute a race of Greek nobility.

In military hierarchy it corresponds to the rank of colonel, and i3 consequently inferior to the designation of pasha, which is bestowed on general officers, but can only be borne by Musulmans. The Porte gave the title of Bey to the hospodars of Wallachia and Mol davia; but it could not be transmitted by inheritance, their children being' simply called Beyzadeh (son of the bey). The descendants of these families have therefore no right to the title of Bey, which, as I have observed, is improperly rendered by \" prince.\""], [252, "Letter 111. 216 LETTERS 0>: TURKEY. Empire began to wane, and Turkey was still looked upon as beyond the pale of the public law of Europe, the Fanariote nobility ceased to exist from the moment that the reforms introduced into the empire had begun to alter its internal condition and its relations with foreign powers. In place of this nobility arose a middle-class aristocracy, so to speak, which, without any political situa tion in the state, exercises an immense influence over the civil and religious affairs of the Greek community. I have already spoken of the origin of this aristocracy, which is chiefly composed of merchants, and which began to appear about the end of the last century, at which period various causes before enumerated contributed to concentrate the commerce of the Levant in the hands of the Greeks. The privileges granted by the Sultan Selim III. to the company of Bairataires, or \"Bairatlis\" (privileged merchants), which he had just instituted, the impulse given to the Greek marine hythe chief admiral Hussein Pasha, and, somewhat later, the suppression of the English Levant company, had all tended to give the Greeks al- most the whole traffic of the Mediterranean. The Sciotes (or Chiotes) especially became remarkable for their pro- digious activity ; they extended their operations as far as America, and their establishments in Xew York, Liver- pool, and London might compete with those at Marseilles, Genoa, Leghorn, Trieste, Odessa, and Moscow. The greater part of these houses speedily acquired immense wealth, and many of them nobly used it. I have already mentioned the Zosimadis of Yanina. Their example was imitated by many of their compatriots in foreign countries :"], [253, "- III.

But the commercial prosperity of the Greeks received. a fatal blow by the revolution of 1821. Many wealthy houses in Constantinople, Smyrna, and the islands, were overwhelmed in one common ruin Chios above all was fearfully devastated, and her principal merchants, espe cially those who were suspected of favouring Bussia or of promoting the designs of the Hetairia, beheld their dwellings and rich storehouses pillaged and destroyed, and in many cases even forfeited their lives on some groundless suspicion. It was thus that the greater number of the Greek merchants were driven to seek safety under foreign pro tection. Some, as the Zizinia and the Rodoconaki, be came French ; others, as the Baltazzi and Ralli, Aus trians : and those who had houses of correspondence in London or Odessa became English or Russian. They derived a twofold advantage from this step\u2014 in security to their trade, and a participation in the privileges and immunities of the Franks ; and this fact explains why the principal Greek merchants at Constantinople and in other parts of the empire, with very few exceptions,' have been 1 The Ps^'.tins family and some few others, who i.. aed sub jects of the Porte.

If at Pera, indeed, they are occasionally ap pointed ephores to certain churches and schools, it is in consequence of special privileges conferred on them as Franks by treaty, and not in their capacity of members of the Greek community. The next division of the Greek population comprises the medical practitioners and the professors of science and literature. For a long period these were the only profes- - open to the youth of Turco-Greece who were poor and aspired to independence. The spirit of adventure which contributed to launch many of their countrymen into commercial speculations was equally powerful in inducing these to adopt a career that demanded several of study and residence in the most civilised countries of Europe. The majority went to Pavia and other Italian universities, where the course of study was less tedious and less expensive than elsewhere. Some made their way as far as France and England. The celebrated Coray studied at Montpelier ; and many others acquired a great reputation either as physicians or scholars. I have already toned some who, on returning to their native coun- try, rendered the chairs of the new colleges illustrious by their talents, and by their teaching prepared the way for Greek emancipation. Many professors of medicine became equally celebrated :"], [255, "Letter III. 219 CIT I. amongst these we find both ministers and diplomatists. Not to mention Panayoti and Alexander Mavrocordato, who founded the political influence of the Fanar, we have had in our owni times Capo d'lstria and Colletti, both of whom commenced their career by the study of medicine. Even to more humble aspirants the medical profession in Turkey has been, and is, a sure source of wealth, espe cially to those who are conversant with the dialects of the country. Many circumstances also combine to render the profession of medicine attractive to the imaginative and sanguine Greek. The respect in which it is held, the privilege it confers of free access to the great and to the interior of the harems, the facility with which any one may assume the medical character, and the impunity which among believers in fatalism naturally attends mistakes, all combine to swell the number of so-called physicians. Formerly it was not even necessary to have received a diploma from an Italian or other university ; to have been seen for a year or two in the streets of Constantinople attached to the suite of some eminent prac titioner, as interpreter, or even as a domestic, was suffi cient to confer the right of purchasing a diploma, signed by the hakeem-bashi,2 and thenceforward of practising at pleasure on the limbs and lives of all the Sultan's subjects.

Zagoria had also its haloiatroi, or skilled doctors, re nowned for the cure of hernia, who were to be found in all parts of the empire, competing with the Cephaloniotes, and exercising indiscriminately the functions of physician, surgeon, dentist, apothecary, and even barber. But besides these roving empirics, the capital and larger provincial towns were crowded with medical men \u2014 Greek, Italian, Armenian, and Jewish \u2014 some practising their profession on their own account, others attached to the household of some pasha, whom they accompanied to his seat of government.

He had been for a length of time private physician to the pasha of the district, but who he was, or whence he came, was never known. Public rumour designated him as French, though he bore an Italian name ; nevertheless the French authorities, on making an inventory of his papers after his death, could find out nothing positive concerning him. 1 have met with many persons who knew him in Persia, or in the town where he died, and all agreed in pronouncing him a man of extraordinary attainments. He not only spoke all the European and Oriental languages, so as to be able to pass at will for Italian, English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Arab, Turk, or Persian, but he was equally well versed in (he history of every country-, and familiar with its manners, politics, and even its court intrigues.

ARTISANS. 221 raised him to the power of an Olivares or a Richelieu ; as it was. he died without leaving even a trace of his real name. At the present day a great improvement has taken place. The creation of the medical school of Galata. Serai', the establishment of quarantines, and of a sanitary systeui similar to that of Europe, at Constantinople and in the trading ports of the Levant, has led to the abolition of many abuses. The Turks themselves, abandoning by degrees their former prejudices, begin to addict them selves to the study of medicine. At present, however, the majority of the native physicians are Greeks or Armenians, who have graduated either in France or Italy, the school of Galata-Sera'i being specially designed for the supply of surgeons to the army or navy. Some of these are deservedly in high repute both as practitioners and as men of general knowledge : I may mention in particular Doctor Stephanos Caratheodory, a Greek, whose marvel lous command of languages might have rivalled that of cardinal Mezzofanti himself, and whose recent publication on the subject of the Holy Places made a great sensation at Constantinople. We have now given an account of the different classes which constitute what may be called the middle class amongst the Turco-Greeks, aud who may be cons'dered as occupying the position and influence once held by the old aristocracy of the Fanar. We have next to consider the artisans, and the esnafs or various guilds. For example, there is the esnaf of the silk-mercers, that of the bacals or grocers, of the tailors, braid-makers, &c. The affairs of these esnafs are similarly administered ; each is under the direction of an elected"], [258, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. 222 chief styled a kiaia, who represents his own guild in their intercourse with the government authorities, and exercises the functions of a police magistrate. The kiaia inflicts certain fines limited by law, intervenes as arbitrator in disputes, fixes the tariff of wages, and is, in fact, the soul of the corporation, which acquires consideration from the probity of his personal character. His functions are annual and gratuitous. There are certain trades which seem to be appropriated by particular nations : as, for instance, the esnafs of the cloth-merchants, bakers, grocers, shoemakers, tailors, furriers, chandlers, and silk-mercers, consist, almost wholly of Greeks: the armourers, paper-makers, book- sellers, confectioners, distillers, engravers of gems, and dealers in wood and charcoal, are mostly Turks; the jewellers, watchmakers, locksmiths, slipper-makers, lace- merchants, embroiderers, joiners, and carpenters, are Armenians : the brokers, pedlers, salesmen, tinkers, &c, are Jews. This distribution of trades, now become tra- ditionary, has been as much owing to chance as to the individual bent of each nation. There are also some employments common to all, such as the khamals (porters\\ the sakas (water-carriers), the kaihjis (boatmen), the fishermen, house-painters, &c. In these latter callings, all the members of the esnaf being equal, and voting numeri- cally for the election of the kiaia, the nation which has the greatest number of representatives in the esnaf naturally carries the day. The institution of these esnafs dates from the earlier periods of the monarchy. They bear a considerable analogy with; the guilds of the middle ages, and with"], [259, "223 Letter III. ARTISVNs. the councils of prud'hommes in France. They formerly enjoyed a great number of privileges, which by lapse of time have fallen into disuse \u2014 amongst them that of having places set apart for them in all public ceremonies, and being present by representation at the coronation of the emperors. The ancient spirit of fraternity which presided at their institution, and which rendered all the members mutually responsible, has gradually disappeared, showing that even Turkey cannot resist the changes of time. However, even with all the deficiencies of their present organization, the esnafs are valuable auxiliaries to the civil power, so that, both in the capital and the provinces, they are much favoured by the Turkish courts ; and an individual would hesitate to engage in litigation with one of them, unless both law and equity were manifestly on his side. Such is the general outline of the Turco-Greek popu lation in the towns, particularly at Constantinople. To complete the account, we must mention the behiars 4 and seamen, who form an intermediate class between the settled inhabitants and what may be called the floating population. The Greek seamen of the imperial navy (three thousand in number) have their quarters in the arsenal of Tersaneh. They are principally natives of the seaport towns of Thrace, Asia Minor, and the islands of the Archipelago. They would unquestionably form the most efficient portion of the Turkish crews, and would render still more important service, were it not for the regulations which debar Chris- 4 Bekiars, literally \"single men;\" in French, \"garcon.\""], [260, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. 224 tians from promotion to the higher ranks of the navy, by which all zeal and emulation are extinguished at the very t of their career. The Greek be'kiars, whose numbers may amount to near fifteen or twenty thousand in the capital alone, are, generally speaking, of Bulgarian origin, or natives of ;a. The Bulgarian be'kiars follow the occupations iherds, fishermen, and arabadjis ;5 they are prin cipally established at Kefeli-Keni, a village on the right bank of the Bosphorus, between Therapia and Buyukdere. At this spot a great number of families subsist by the fisheries of the Bosphorus ; the fish principally taken is the pelamides or tunny, the trade in which with the interior amounts annually to more than twenty thousand piastres. There are also families of Ziganes from Bul garia, the women of which tell fortunes, while the men dabble a little in various callings, though they principally pick up a livelihood as jugglers, &c. Finally, there are some whose migrations are periodical, and who quit their villages every year at harvest- time to seek work in neighbouring countries, and, when the labours of the field are completed, return home with the earnings of their toil. The Zagorian is the Savoyard or Auvergnat of Turkey. Like those mountaineers, he departs in youth from the sterile soil of his native hills to seek for employment abroad, and after collecting a little store returns to spend the remainder of his days in his native village.

Of this class were the Zosimadis already mentioned : though few reach such a height of prosperity, aud many, who set out with hopeful and ambitious hearts, return at the expiration of ten or twelve years no richer than before. The Zagorian is to be met with everywhere \u2014 iu Greece, in Austria, Russia, and the United Statea His trades are as universal as his travels ; nothing comes amiss to him ; pedler, merchant, surgeon, innkeeper, quack-doctor, or schoolmaster \u2014 he knows and is fit for all : in short, the original portrait of Juvenal's satire. Having now passed in review the different classes who compose the Greek ra'iah population of Turkish towns and cities, let us say a few words respecting those who are en gaged in agriculture and rural pursuits. The Greek agri cultural population on the continent and in the islands may be divided into three classes : namely, landed proprietors ; farmers of tehiffliks ; and husbandmen, or cultivators ofthe soil. The first class is not very numerous, so far at least as regards the Greeks, the majority of the tehiffliks (large lauded estates) being in the hands of Turks or Armenians, whilst the Greek generally prefers to invest his money in commercial enterprises, both because these produce a larger return, and are better suited to his active and enterprising disposition. On the other hand, the occupation of a gentle man farmer, as the English style it, is remarkably congenial to the habits and tastes of the Osmanli and the Armenian, l3"], [262, "226 \"KEY. letter III. who resemble each other in many points. The li'e ofthe Turkish aga or country gentleman, living on his tchifflik, and superintending its cultivation, is a model of simplicity and dignity. Respected by his vassals, and beloved by his neighl , ever ready to extend hospitabty to the \u2022er, he passes tbe day in superintending the labours of the field ; and, when evening arrives, he recites pas sages of the Koran to his assembled family and servants. But the grave and monotonous calmness of such an .ice is little suited to the busy and restless nature of the Greek. The second cias-s comprehends renters or farmers of tehiffliks. These are in some measure traders, and many Greeks are therefore found amongst them. They hire large tehiffliks or domains to relet them in small portions to peasants, or metayers, who are the real cultivators of the soil. Tlie \" metayer \" pays as rent a fixed proportion of the produce of the land he cultivates, the proprietor advancing the capital and finding the stock by which the labour of the cultivator is assisted. It, is difficult to determine with precision the proportionate value of the landlord's advances, as they vary in different provinces, and even in different localities ofthe same pro vince ; but they usually comprise, besides the land and necessary buildings, od-mills, wine-presses, &c., accord ing to circumstances, a pair of oxen for labour, seed for cropping the farm, and firewood. The profits are almost everywhere distributed in the fol lowing proportions. The government first takes a tenth of the whole produce ; the remainder is then divided into thirds, of which one becomes the share of the landlord,"], [263, "227 Letter III. \\ ATORS. and two fall to the metayer, the amount of the vergu, or land-tax, being defrayed between them. In some districts, however, especially Thessaly, a large proportion of the peasants engaged in husbandry are not metayers : in the latter province out of about eight hundred families com posing the population of twenty tehiffliks, half at least are labourers hired by the day, and earning on an average six piastres per diem. This, deducting Sundays and holidays, very numerous in the Greek Church, on which no labour is performed, leaves barely 12/. a year for the support of themselves and their families, the payment of the kharadj to the state, and the dues claimed by the church. Notwithstanding this, their condition is, on the whole, superior to that of the agricultural labourer in France and many other parts of Europe ; and the gene rality of travellers who have visited European Turkey concur in representing the Bulgarian peasant as one of the happiest of his class. Money, indeed, is seldom seen under his roof, but he has all other things in abundance meat, poultry, milk, eggs, rice, cheese, wine, bread, and clothing. It is also true that h ; possesses neither spoon nor fork, he has no bedstead, and sleeps upon a mat of reeds ; a few wooden vessels comprise the whole of his furniture and household effects : but he aspires to nothing beyond the peaceful enjoyment of his means, and may therefore be called happy. I have elsewhere mentioned this absence of wants as one cause of the decline of agriculture in Turkey. Whilst the peasant with us is stimulated to unceasing activity by the desire of increasing his property, there he"], [264, "228 QBKEY. Letter III. only covets peace and repose. If he possess a field, far from seeking to enlarge it, he only cultivates as much of \u25a0lecessary for his subsistence. He rises at daybreak, and, placing his working-tools on the shoulders of his wife, driving his oxen before him, and smoking his tchibouk, he marches to his field, and quits it again as soon as the sun has attained some height above the horizon, whilst the household affairs are attended to by the grandmother, who remains at home to look after the children and pre- he meals. The cultivators of the soil in European Turkey and in the islands are generally more prosperous than in Asiatic Turkey : either because the former possess more outlets for the sale of their produce, or that, the Turkish popula tion being less numerous, the Greeks had formerly less to suffer from the aggressions of the pashas. The nature of the cultivation varies of course with that of the locality. Here wheat predominates, there the vine or olive ; else where sheep and cattle are depastured on the extensive plains or mountainous tracts. The metayers and day labourers form the most numerous and interesting class of the rural population. The tradesmen of towns and vil lages, where there are no esnafs (such as bakers, grocers, &c.), and also those, both male and female, who follow trades peculiar to certain localities, weavers of mats, carpets, &c, may be classed as belonging to the same population, for their habits and modes of life, exclusive of their special callings, resemble those of the agriculturists among whom they dwell."], [265, "Letter III. POLITICAL TENDENCIES OF TURCO-GREECE. '2^9 III. Political Condition of the Greeks in the Turkish Empire. To complete this sketch of the condition of the Greek inhabitants of Turkey we ought perhaps to give some account of their manners and the habits of the different classes. This would doubtless form the most picturesque portion of our work, and prove interesting and curious to our readers ; but these details would hardly come within the scope of our undertaking, and they have been fre quently given, with more or less minuteness, by various historians and travellers. Our particular object is to as certain the political tendencies of the Turco-f Jreeks, the sentiments they entertain towards the Turks, and the modifications which their national character has undergone. These are the points most important for us to elucidate, and we will commence by the Greeks of the Orthodox Church. In the first place it is essential to distinguish accurately between the Greek population of Turkey and Constantino ple, and the Hellenes, or Greeks of Greece proper. At first sight the difference is not very apparent ; both possess the characteristic features of the race : shrewd, though credu lous ; enterprising and ingenious, turbulent and inconstant ; distinguished by keen curiosity, boundless vanity, and a fertility of invention which too often leads them to regard the practice of deception as an accomplishment rather than a crime.6 In these respects the Greeks are what they were 6 Whatever points of resemblance this portrait may bear to the Greeks of Asia and Constantinople, it is greatly exaggerated with regard to the others.

The reader who would see them portrayed to the life will find the picture sketched by a frequently occasion to admire their good qualities than to remark their vices. Their cheerfulness and personal bravery, their eager thirst for knowledge, and great natural talents \u2014 the devotion of servants, when kindly dealt with, to their masters\u2014 their tenderness towards childhood \u2014 and their grateful remembrance of benefits, and even of the smallest marks of kindness \u2014 are the characteristics which have im pressed themselves most vividly on our recollection. \" Probably neither the virtues nor the vices of the Greeks would have such warmth of attention had they not both been faithfully transmitted from antiquity. Distorted or exaggerated by the broad and turbid meridian through which they have passed, they are in substance and nature unchanged, and possibly may not be susceptible of change; as the magnificent country in which they seem indigenous, after being subjected in its various fortunes to the extreme of human care and cultivation \u2014 the extreme of devastation and neglect \u2014 retains the same splendid outlines of its mountains, its islands, its peaks, and its pro montories, unaltered and unalterable. But as in ancient days political circumstances were such as to bring forward and illustrate the ioftier ter, throwing a partial shade over its defects; so, in the later times, the hand of slavery forced into light whatever therein was defective, barren, or misshapen. We ought besides to draw a broad distinction between the higher aud lower orders ; and there exists a numerous class of Greeks who are exempt from any general charge of demoralization. The agricultural part of the population, those with whom traveller* are usually least acquainted, are certainly as free from vicious habits as any existing peasantry. Ignorant, indeed, and unedu cated, they possess not those activ% virtues which are commonly attri buted to the Swiss aud other mountaineer- of the west; but is it not some merit to have come forth from so long a bondage unseared by any deep impression of the fetter?

This durability of feature is one ofthe points which most forcibly strikes the traveller who visits the localities of Greece at the present day. For example, it is difficult, even with the assistance of a guide, to trace the limits of the Agora at Athens ; but, on seeing the eager crowds which throng the precincts of the chamber of deputies \u2014 on hearing the mingled sounds that arise from the groups of street orators, storytellers, and newsmongers \u2014 cries, jests, repartees, laughter, ap plause, and acclamations, all going on at the same time, and mingling in one Babel of confusion \u2014 I could easily have supposed myself among the contemporaries of Demosthenes or Philip of Macedon. So too, when from the lofty Acropolis I have gazed around on the distant mountains tinted with their fleeting lights and shadows, and the blue ocean with its silvery waves rippling among the isles and promontories, so faithfully described by the poets, I have found that the very contemplation of what rose before my eyes gave a new sense to some epithet which heretofore had seemed frivolous or obscure. The scene in the Hermes-street, above sketched, was a real drama of Aristophanes ; and the panorama from the Acropolis formed the best illustration of Homer.7 7 The clouds in the play of Aristophanes to which they give their name are naturally represented as coming to the theatre at Athens from"], [268, "Letter III. 232 LETTERS ON TURKEY. At the same time we must be on our guard against pushing this parallel to exaggeration Although the pri mitive type has never been quite effaced even among the races which have the most degenerated, still it has be come more or less obscured by the action of time and circumstance. For this reason there is as wide a differ ence between the Romaics, or Greeks of Turkey, and the Hellenes, as probably between these latter and the ancient Greeks. The courage and love of liberty which still animate the Flellenes are no longer to be found amongst the former. In proof of this we need but to look back to the Greek war of independence. The Hetairia\" had fas will be recollected) calculated from the very outset on a general rising throughout the Greek populations in the Turkish provinces : how were their expectations answered ? Attica and the adjoining islands, part of Thessaly, and Epirus, alone responded to the appeal sent forth from the Morea ; whilst Thrace and Constantinople, the flourishing cities of the coasts of Asia Minor, and the islands of the Turkish archipelago, remained inactive and silent spec tators of the struggle.

POLITICAL TENDENCIES OF TURCO-GREECE. 233 Turks, were it not for the fact that, at Smyrna, in Chios, and in Candia, the Greek population were nearly treble their Ottoman masters in numbers. But those also were Greek only in name : the last spark of patriotism had become extinct in their breasts, and they would probably long since have ceased to exist as a separate race but for the barrier of religious dissimilarity, which, as we have elsewhere observed, was from the beginning so broadly marked by the Turks that its effect was to preserve the distinctions of nationality along with those of creed. Grown wealthy by commerce and by usury, more keenly alive to the enjoyments of luxury than to the dis grace of subjection, the chief glory of the Greek ra'iahs consisted in skilfully duping the masters who despised whilst they made use of them ; and however great their likeness to the degenerate Greeks of imperial Rome, they bore no resemblance to the ancient heroes of Sparta and of Athens. The former were in fact their real ancestors. When it was announced that Constantine had determined to remove the seat of his empire from Rome to a half- Grecian city on the shores of the Bosphorus, the whole flock of adventurers and parasites \u2014 thus described by- Juvenal three centuries before \u2014 \" Grammaticus, rhetor, geometres, pictor, aliptes, Augur, sch\u00e6nobates, medicus, magus : omnia novit Gr\u00e6culus esuriens in ccclum jusseris, ibit\" \u2014 hastened, like birds of prey, to the new capital ; whilst all that was really noble in the Greek race \u2014 the laborious peasant, the sincere lover of science, and the earnest phi losopher \u2014 clung to the soil of their native Greece, de voting themselves to cultivating its fields or its literature."], [270, "Letter III. 234 LETTERS ON TURKEY. It is therefore not astonishing that the Greeks of the Lower Empire, springing from so ignoble a stock, should have degenerated more and more, till the last remnant of patriotism and national honour disappeared with the last Constantine on that fatal day which deprived him of his throne and his subjects of their liberty. Since that time, as Gibbon observes, the Greeks have not changed. It may be said of them to-day, as truly as at the time of the conquest, that they had \" idle hands and busy tongues.\" The testimony of Gibbon is confirmed by Tournefort, De Tott, Spon and Wheler, Thornton, and all the other travellers who have at various periods visited Turkey. Eton alone takes up the cause of the Greeks with enthusiasm. Writing some time before the Greek revolution, he says, \" Like noble and spirited coursers, champing with impatience the curb which restrains them, they wait but the signal that shall release them from subjection and set them free on the path of glory.\" However, when he comes to speak of the different classes of the population, it is curious to note howr at every instant his conclusions contradict his premises. He begins by describing the Greeks of the Fanar, \" who,'' he says, \" generally have all the vices of the Turks. Those who become vaiwodes or hospodars of Walachia and Mol davia closely resemble the Turkish pashas in their avidity and love of exaction ; their minds have lost all vigour, and their hearts all generosity.\" He next goes on to describe the merchants and lower orders of Greeks at Constantinople, \" whose character indeed offers nothing remarkable ; they resemble tbe rest of the Christians in all narts of the empire who live by traffic : that is to"], [271, "Letter III. 235 TURKISH PARTY. say, they are as cunning and as rascally as the Jews themselves.\" Where, then, was the patriotism, the courage, he spoke of in such glowing terms ? It was there where, thirty years later, it burst out in a flame which astonished all Europe ; hidden amongst the half-savage mountaineers of Epirus aud Albania, the lawless inhabitants ofMistra,9 and the sturdy, intrepid islanders. To judge from appearances, the conquest had given the death-blow to Greek nation ality, and its last traces must soon become extinct ; but so far was this from being the case, that, from causes already explained, not only has Greek nationality continued to survive, but has even acquired a development which, in the apprehension of certain writers, is incompatible with the duration of the Ottoman empire. Let us now examine how far these apprehensions are likely to be realised. As regards their political ten dencies, the Greek subjects in Turkey may be divided into two parties : the one, attached to Turkey, and to the maintenance of the status quo of things ; the other, who are partisans of change, desiring, or rather dreaming, of the emancipation of the Greek people, but destitute of any common agreement as to the time for the revolutionary movement, or its definite object. The first party is the least numerous, and includes in its ranks the ancient nobility of the Fanar, the superior clergy, the lay dignitaries of the church, and the wealthy merchants who have continued subjects of the Forte. It 9 The inhabitants of the southern part of the Morea, the ancient Laconia, are in many respects worthy descendants of their Spartan ancestors. \u2014 T."], [272, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. 236 is a very common error to suppose that the superior clergy of the Eastern Church in Turkey are secretly attached to Russia. The clergy in Turkey, as elsewhere, are of the ecclesiastical party, and of that alone ; they arc little solicitous as to what power governs, provided their own religious and civil supremacy be not attacked. Under the Ottoman rule, the Fatriarch of Constantinople is not only the spiritual pastor of twelve millions of souls, but is also invested with a sort of kingly authority over six millions of subjects, over whom he exercises the most extensive jurisdiction \u2014 levying imposts, distributing jus tice, dispensing spiritual pardon and condemnation, remitting or inflicting temporal punishment, and, in short, opening and closing at wdl the gates of the prison and of paradise. In the same manner each metropolitan in his eparchy for diocese) participates in the right of the patriarch to exercise (of course within narrower limits) both spiritual and temporal authority. But suppose the power of the Czar once established at Constantinople : the \u0153cumenical patriarch, the head of a great church, invested with the delegated power of the Sultan over a fifth part of his subjects, sinks at once into a Bussian archbishop, adorned perhaps with a more pom pous title than his colleagues, but equally dependent upon the Synod of St Petersburg, and equally liable to receive the commands of the autocrat from a colonel of hussars, who may chance to be one of his aides-de-camp. No illusion on this subject is possible. The Greeks of the Fanar cannot forget that the Czar Peter the Great severed the tie which united the Muscovite Church to the"], [273, "237 Letter III. HELLENISM \u2014 RUSSIAN TARTY. mother-church of Constantinople, and declared himself sole head of the orthodox religion ; and they know how the unfortunate bishops of the Russian Church have been ever since compelled to submit to a despotism which de mands only slaves, and tolerates no partners in power. It is not surprising, therefore, that the most considerable Greek families, and all those who in Constantinople or the provinces occupy an elevated position in the church, in commerce, or as government functionaries, should openly incline towards the Porte, with whose interests their own are closely bound up. The party opposed to the Turkish domination is united on one point only \u2014 the expulsion of the Turks from Europe ; that end attained, they have no longer anything in common. Some dream of an independent Romaic state ; others would be not unwilling to see the imperial throne of Byzantium restored, and occupied by the Czar or some member of his family ; others, again, who form what is called the party of Hellenism, simply desire to be annexed to Greece. Hellenism, like Germanism, exists as yet only in theory. Imported into Turkish Greece by professors from Athens, it has scarcely yet made its way beyond the circles of literary and social life. It serves as a brilliant and effec tive text for learned essayists, for doct.rs in their schools, and for the declamations of their aspiring pupils. But there is a wide distance between declamation and action. I have conversed with many Greeks in Turkey, and amongst them have met with very few who seriously be lieved in the possibility of such an annexation, still fewer who were disposed to act in the cause. It must, how-"], [274, "ERS ON TURKEY. Letter III. 238 ever, be acknowledged that these few belonged to the most enlightened and liberal class of the nation ; namely, the members of the medical, legal, and literary profes sions. Beyond this narrow circle, Hellenism, however well adapted to flatter the national vanity of the Greeks, can not boast of many adherents. The doctrine of race, on which it is founded, has no ready access to the under standing of the masses. We should have little chance of being understood by a peasant of Bulgaria or Macedonia in telling him that, wherever the Greek idiom is spoken, there too should Greece itself be found : and granting that the motive were sufficiently powerful to stimulate and prevail with the multitude, what could be effected by two millions of souls, which is the whole amount of the Greek population in Turkey? \u2014 for there is no possibility of a combined action with the Bulgarians and the other Sclavonic populations, the antipathy between the races being such that they would rather perish separately than be saved together. It can. then, hardly be supposed that the domination of the Osmanlis in Europe is seriously menaced by Hel lenism. The disturbance which broke out a few years ago at the school of Kourou-tchesme, and which led to the dismissal of all the Hellenic professors, was in feet nothing more than a revolt of students against their preceptor. Is it not a law in physics that the force of attraction in bodies is in a direct ratio with their bulk? The kingdom of Greece therefore exhibits too little solidity, its part in the affairs of Europe and the East is too unimportant, and its future too uncertain, to constitute it the rallying-point for the scattered members of the Grecian family."], [275, "Letter III.

Based mainly on the prevalent reli- gious fanaticism \u2014 relying more on the instinct than on the reasoning power of the masses \u2014 and favoured by nearly all the inferior clergy, whose immediate contact with the people gives them the greater influence \u2014 the Russian principle is daily more and more propagated by the inde- fatigable zeal and numerous resources of its votaries. Whilst Hellenism is confined to the precincts of colleges and drawing-rooms, Russian influence penetrates every- where, working its way sometimes openly, sometimes by the secret distribution of golden bribes, religious tracts, catechisms, and portraits of the orthodox Emperor, min- gled studiously with those of the Ylanayiix.

Even the indistinct- f distance lends strength to the charm. An unseen but irresistible impulse thus draws the Greek populations within the arms of Russia : all thoughts, all eyes, are turned to her as the country whence the deliverer is to appear : the superior clergy alone offer a passive resist ance to this tendency, aware that their own spiritual power, and the real or assumed supremacy of the Church of Constantinople, would fall in the triumph of Russia. We must be careful, however, not to exaggerate the importance of this movement. With their eyes ever turned towards Russia, the Turco-Greek population will not"], [276, "LETTERS ON TURKEY.

He himself is generally the first dupe of his own exaggeration. A few years ago, some travellers in the island of Mity lene were returning, charmed with an excursion they had made to the delicious valley, filled with gardens, kiosks, and country-houses, which skirts the south of the town. Perceiving a family of Greeks seated beneath a plane tree, enjoying the cool shade, they approached and entered into conversation. The head of the family in formed them that his name was Antoniades ; that one of the three women present was his wife, the two others his daughters ; that he had a son established as a com mercial agent at Smyrna ; that he himself had a shop in the neighbouring town : and that, his affairs having, by the grace of God, prospered well, he had been able, out of his savings, to purchase a country-house, where he and his family came to enjoy the fine season. Tlie travellers congratulated him on his happiness ; and one of them having made some exclamation about the beauty of the site, he immediately launched into a tirade against the tyranny of the Turks : \u2014 \" Barbarians, that they were !\u2022 scattering on all sides ruin and desolation, and that too over a country so bountifully treated by"], [277, "Letter III.

His visitors, he said, should be on the spot some six weeks later, when the fruits of all kinds would be mature, and the now tranquil landscape would swarm with multitudes of country -people gathering in the harvest. Thence, gliding imperceptibly from the elegy to the idyll, he com menced an animated description of the details of the scene. Nothing was wanting : the songs of the reapers \u2014 the golden ears falling beneath their sickle\u2014 the rich gum of the mastic shrub dropping into osier baskets \u2014 the joyful shouting of the children \u2014 the arch frolics of the young girls \u2014 -the circling dances that concluded the day.

Their path led across an extensive field of wheat, and through orchards of luxuriant fruit-trees, bordered by hedges of myrtle. Everything, as the merchant informed them, was his property. The house itself, surrounded and half concealed by orange-trees, was constructed of wood, according to the custom of the country, but very spacious and convenient. The customary glyco (sweetmeats), coffee, and pipes, having been handed round, the merchant resumed his favourite theme, and recommenced his complaints against the tyranny of the Turks, blind to the astonishment of his guests, who marvelled at an oppression which raised its victims to such an enviable prosperity.

The erroneous impressions respecting Turco-Greece which prevad so generally at the present time may be mainly ascribed to a neglect of this truth. They are also perhaps in some measure attributable to the dissimilarity of national character. The Turk, bene volent and hospitable, but grave and reserved, commands a certain respect, but attracts no confidence, for the very courtesy of his manner is tinctured with the profound conviction of superiority which he inwardly cherishes: whilst the Greek, voluble, familiar, and communicative, vates you by the flattery of his address, by the warmth of hi ig, and by the graceful expressions of his picturesque la his exaggerations and hyperboles win their way more easily from the air of good faith with which they are uttered ; and if he does not impose upon, lie at least captivates and amuses you.

Were a Bussian army encamped under the walls of Con stantinople, they might possibly be roused to insurrection : but, short of such an event, neither they nor any of the Turco-Greeks will make a forward movement. The campaign of 1829 afforded evidence of this. While the Russians were besieging Varna, at only five days' march from Constantinople, the Turco-Greeks were, during four months, in the most feverish state of anxiety. but public tranquillity was not for a moment disturbed either in the capital or the provinces.

Armenian writers give them the name of Haig hasdan, or Haiasdan, derived from Haig, great-grandson of Japhet, who, according to their account, fled thither from Babylon twenty-two centuries before Christ, (2107). The popular name of Aram, however, appears to be de rived fronuAram, the sixth successor of Haig, and con temporary of Ninus, though Strabo derives it from Armenus, one of the Argonauts.

Armenia, previous to its becoming the prey of the Per sians, Turks, and Russians, formed a vast kingdom, which underwent and survived numberless convulsions and catas trophes, from the time of its foundation by Haig, up to the end of the fourteenth century of the Christian era. It was successively governed by four dynasties, namely, the"], [284, "Letter IV. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 248 Haicians, or descendants of Haig ; 2 the Archazouni, or Arsacides ; 3 the Pacradouni, or Pagratides ; 4 and the Roupenians, or Rupenians.5 These dynasties do not follow each other without interruption, the three first being separated by an interval of several centuries, during which Armenia, subjugated by its powerful neighbours, beheld its native princes replaced by foreign governors \u2014 Marzbans/ Curopalates,' and Osdigans 8 \u2014 who oppressed the country by tyranny and exactions. Each of these dynasties also presents numerous breaks and interregna, occasioned by the rivalry of the nakharars, or nobles, which produced civil wars and the progressive decay both of the court and the nation. The political vicissitudes, no less than the geographical position of Armenia, contributed to the formation of a mixed religious creed, which, borrowing its elements from the Sabeanism of the Chaldeans, the Magism of the Per sians, and the paganism of the Greeks, placed the temples of Jupiter. Venus, aud Hercules side by side with those of Mithra and Armazd (Ormuzd).9 The first-named worship was derived from the old empires of Babylon and Nineveh, to which Armenia was originally tributary ; and when, at a later period, it passed under Persian rule, the reform of Zoroaster took root and flourished, not without a not- , years before J.

About this epoch Christianity was first introduced into Armenia. The first seed is believed to have been sown in the lifetime of Jesus Christ by Thaddeus, one of the seventy-two disciples, and by St. Bartholomew the apostle, whom the people of India, Arabia, and Persia, revere as their first missionary. After this the Gospel was preached throughout Armenia by Syrian priests, who commenced erecting monasteries on the ruins of the ancient pagan temples. But the true apostle and civiliser of Armenia was Saint Gregory, surnamed the Enlightener (Lousa rovitch), sprung from the Arsacides of Persia, who con verted the great king Tiridates (Dertad) in 302, and instituted the Patriarchal see, of which he was the first titular occupant, under the title of Catoghigos (universal). Saint Gregory, after holding this dignity for a period of thirty years, which he employed in organising his church, retired to the desert, and died there in 342, at the age of eighty-five. The introduction of Christianity was the signal of the regeneration of Armenia. Ignorance began to disappear, and schools were opened in every quarter : letters and science were cultivated, and celebrated men arose, amongst whom was Mesrob, the inventor of the Armenian alpha bet '! Saint James of Nisiba ; the historian Phaustus of Byzantium; Saint Isaac the Great, who translated the 1 Towards the middle of the fourth century.

This great social and intellectual movement was arrested at the end of a century by the Greek heresy of Eutyches, which was also the cause of the -chism by which the Armenian nation is still divided against itself. \"Towards the end ofthe tenth century,\" says M.Flandin, in his 'Souvenirs de Voyage en Perse et en Armenie,' \" the greater part of Armenia scarcely merited the name. All the petty princes who shared the territory amongst them were engaged in intestine warfare, and ready to give up their country to the Mahometans rather than submit to one of their own number. There could be no existence for a country torn by such rivalries, and it was therefore easily subjugated by the Khalifs and overrun A portion, however, of the Armenian nation retired towards the north, and settled between Kars and Ani, and for a short time this country formed a small kingdom under the protection of a Musulman prince ; it was the last that bore the name of Armenia, and Ani became its flourishing capital, though its pros- perity was of brief duration.

In the general dispersion some, however, took an opposite direction, and fled as far as Cilicia, where they founded, at Tarsus, a small state, which bravely maintained itself in the midst of the Greeks and the Sultans of Iconium and Syria. When the cru saders appeared in Asia Minor, the princes of Tarsus, remembering the approximation of their creeds, came to the support of the Christian cause, and several of them fought valiantly under the banners of the princes of Antioch. \" In the fourteenth century, the King of Tarsus, being hard pressed by the Mahometans, appealed for assistance to the Pope and the Latin Christians ; but the appeal of schismatics was disregarded. A kingdom of Franks how ever had arisen opposite to the Cilician coast, in Cyprus, and the princes of the house of Lusignan were its rulers. The Armenian monarch, in the midst of his struggle against the infidels, died without an heir, and the people hastened to offer their vacant throne to a Lusignan : but, notwithstanding the support which it derived from this connection with the Franks, the little kingdom of Tamts was still too feeble to oppose a barrier to the .powerful Sultan of Cairo. The knights of Rhodes, as became their renown, made the most valiant efforts to sustain the Chris tian cause, but all was in vain ; the standard of Mahomet was planted on the walls of Tarsus, and the last sovereign of the house of Lusignan, Leo VI., after successive cap tivity at Jerusalem and at Cairo, reached Paris, and died there in 1393.3 3 He was buried in the church of the Celestins.

From this date the history of Armenia becomes blended with that of the Ottomans, successors of the Seldjoucides, afterwards with that of the Mamelouks, and finally with that of the Asiatic Greeks. The ancient territory of Haiasdan, conquered by the Sultans, was divided into pashaliks. The eastern portion only, contiguous to Persia, continued subject to that power ; whilst in the southern part the emirs, or Kurd chieftains, protected by the moun tains of the country, divided it into a number of small, independent principalities under the nominal sovei of the Porte. The taking of Constantinople by the Turks produced a favourable change to the Armenian nation. By com mand of the conqueror, Joachim Archbishop of Brousa removed, with a great number of Armenian families, to Constantinople, where he was raised by Mohammed to the rank of Patriarch of his nation, with full autho rity over all Armenians established in Greece and Anatolia, and invested with rights and privileges similar to those which had been recently granted to the Greek patriarch. The Sultan having also accorded to the new colony a vast and commodious quarter in the suburb of Galata as a residence, many families, whom the calamities of war and religious persecution had driven into other countries, flocked thither to enjoy, under the protection of the patriarchal throne and the tolerant rule of the Sultan, repose and prosperity which had long been unknown to their nation.

These convulsions, not produced, as might have been supposed, by the vexations or intolerance of the Turks, but by the violent efforts of the Roman Church to detach the Armenians from their schism, and bring about unity of religion, led to an explosion at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Up to that time the Armenian Church and nation had enjoyed a profound peace. We find indeed towards the end of the sixteenth century (1587) that the Bishop of Sidon was sent as ambassador by Pope Sextus V. to the Greek communities of Syria, namely, the Armenians. Melkites, Jacobites, and Chaldeans, with a view to re establish the authority of the Holy See over these four schismatic churches. But this effort was not crowned with success, although the legate of the Pope, after having for a long time negotiated with the Armenian Patriarch of Cilicia 4 respecting the union of the churches according to the statutes of the council of Florence, finally persuaded him to sign a confession of the Catholic faith. 4 The Armenian Church then obeyed two patriarchs, who resided, one at the monastery of Eczmiazin, in Great Armenia, the other at Sis, in Cilicia.

After having taken orders he hesi tated fora while about joining the Jesuits, but at length came to the decision that he could serve the cause of the church more effectively by remaining in his own country and en deavouring to reclaim his schismatic brethren. He appears at this time to have conceived the plan of the-congrega tion which he afterwards founded, aud to which he gave his name. The doctor Arachelian, one of the first dis ciples of the Propaganda,5 to whom he disclosed his pur pose, tried in vain to dissuade him from it, by representing the difficulties of the enterprise and the dissensions it would cause in the nation. Mdchitar, moved by regard for the church alone, persisted in his project, and came to Constantinople to mature it (1700).

This persecution, kindled by Ephrem, blazed with double fury under his successor Avedik, who, by his own intrigues and the protection of the grand mufti Feizoullah, had mounted the patriarchal throne in 1702. It soon spread to Asia.

The following description is by a writer whose name is an authority on all subjects relating to Armenia : \u2014 \" On the morning of the 8th of January, eight of the principal Armenian bankers of Constantinople were informed that a decree was issued commanding their banishment to Angora, and their counting-houses to be sealed up. All the Armenians of Angora residing at Constantinople were at the same time ordered to depart, leaving all their possessions behind. These rigorous measures were soon extended to the rest of the Armenian Catholics, who, by a fresh ferman, the promulgation of which had been intrusted to the Patriarch of the Armenian Church, were condemned to quit Con stantinople, and take up their abode in the surrounding villages, which were inhabited by many of their non united countrymen. Fifteen days only were allowed for their removal, and being thus obliged to dispose of their houses and possessions hastily, and for half the value, many were reduced to great poverty.

All separatists and schismatics were therefore invited to abjure their errors and conform to the laws, by returning to the bosom of their church and nation, on wdiich condition alone they would be pardoned.9 It may be easily conceived that the Roman Catholic powers of Europe did not remain indifferent spectators of this attack on their co-religionists. M. Guilleminot,1 the ambassador of France, interfered most energetically on behalf of the united-Armenians, and by pointing out the loss, not to say ruin, which must ensue to commerce, and indeed to government itself, if this proscription of so many of its wealthy subjects, especially the Armenian bankers, should be persevered in, succeeded at last in producing in the mind of the Sultan convictions which humanity and sound policy ought already to have inspired. everest measures were rescinded, many Armenian Catholics reinstated in their employments ; finally, liberty of religious worship was proclaimed, and a patriarch appointed by the Vatican and recognised by the Porte as the religious head of the Roman Catholic Armenians in Turkey.2 But this result was not obtained till after long and difficult negotiations, the success of which was entirely due to the intervention of France.

Pertew Effendi endeavoured to elude this demand by offer ing to include the Armenians among the Latin raiassi \u2014 that is to say, among the ra'iahs of the Latin creed, who, without forming a distinct nationality, recognised the spi ritual jurisdiction of the apostolic vicar of Constantinople ; but General Guilleminot absolutely rejected this proposi tion, and persisted in claiming the full and entire eman cipation not only of the united-Armenians, but also of all the other nations united to the Roman Catholic Church, as Melkhites, Maronites, Syrians, &&, and their incorporation under a temporal chief, and enjoyment of all the liberties and privileges guaranteed to other raiahs.

The Russians, ever since their establishment beyond the Caucasus, in con sequence of tbe cession of Georgia to the Czar Paul I., by the last king, George XIII. (28th of December, 1800), had been almost continually at war either with Turkey or Persia concerning their respective frontiers. At the close of the last campaign against the prince royal of Persia, Abbas Mirza, which had been still more favourable to the Russian arms than the preceding ones, and which was marked by the capture of Erivan 3 and Tebriz, tbe Persians were compelled to cede the khanat of Talich, as well as the Armenian provinces of Nakhitchevan and Erivan. Russia attached the greater importance to the latter province, because it contains the monastery of Eczmiazin, which is venerated as the religious centre of all Armenia. The year lbi'd was marked by an event which caused a great sensation among the European legations at Pera, and which was oil the point of producing a rupture be tween the Porte and England. A young Armenian, aged twenty-two, had voluntarily embraced Islamism. Some little time after, becoming a prey to remorse of conscience, he quitted Stamboul for Syra, returned to the Christian faith, substituted the European costume for the Oriental, and, relying on his change of attire to escape the terrible consequences of his abjuration, had the imprudence to go back to Constantinople. lie knew, however, that J The city of Erivan was taken in October, 1824, by Paskevitch, who for this service received the title of Trince of Erivan. \u2014 T."], [301, "Letter IV. 265 CASE OF OYAGHIAN. although the religious law of Islam was extremely strict on this point, punishing every such relapse with death, yet the Turkish government, alive to the severity of its own legislation, never sought out offences of this nature ; but, on the contrary, studiously evaded the necessity of inflicting a penalty which it had not power to abolish.

It pleaded that the delay which had taken place in the execution of the sentence proved the reluctance with which the government had yielded to a legal necessity beyond its control ; and, above all, it pleaded the impossibility of abrogating in this summary manner one of the fundamental laws of the empire.

It may be remem bered that the fourth Ecumenical Council, assembled at Chalcedon in 451, during the pontificate of Saint Leo, had lished, in opposition to the heresiarch Eutyches, archi mandrite at Constantinople, the perpetual and universal belief of the Church, that the divine and human natures, united in Jesus Christ, formed a single person only. The partisans of Eutyches, united with those of his disciple Dioscorus, spread themselves in Asia, and everywhere propagated the report that the assembly of Chalcedon had admitted the duality of persons, and renewed the errors See Mosheim, Eccles. Hist., vol. iv. p. 260. \u2014 T."], [305, "269 Letter V. PATRIARCHATE OF ECZM1 of Nestonus. The disposition of the Armenian nation was then unfavourable to the Greeks. These false reports, artfully contrived, were eagerly caught up ; and although the Armenians have subsequently in some measure recog nised the mistake which led them to suppose the see of Rome tainted with Eutychism, the misconception never theless paved the way for the schism completed a century and a half later (596) by the second council assembled at Tevin, at which ten bishops were present, under the pre sidency of the Patriarch Abraham I.2 The schism has subsisted since that time \u2014 that is to say, during twelve centuries and a half; and although the Armenians are as much opposed as the Romish Church to Eutyches personally, and reject him as heretical, nevertheless, by a strange contradiction, they reject with equal zeal the epistle of Pope Leo the Great, and the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon, by whom Eutyches was condemned. Thence arises the singular position of this Church, which, \" halting between two opinions,\" vacillates and temporises between the Greeks and the Latins, sometimes inclining to one and sometimes to the other in search of enlighten ment and support ; but on the whole still adhering with unwavering attachment to her ancient doctrines and ritual observances. The points on which the Armenian Church is at vari ance with that of Rome are seven in number :\u2014 1, it denies the supremacy of the Roman see ; 2, it rejects 5 We must not confound the second synod of Tevin, held by Abraham I., with that which Moses II. assembled forty-five years before, and in which the calendar was reformed."], [306, "LETTERS ON TURKEY.

The Armenian Church is governed by three patriarchs. The chief of these is the Patriarch of Eczmiazin, in Russian Armenia, who is styled Khatoghigos or universal. The two others reside in the Ottoman territory ; the one at Sis, in Cilicia, the other at Agthamar, a little island in the lake of Yan. The erection, or rather restoration, of the patriarchal seat of Eczmiazin dates from the year 1441, about the epoch of the Council of Florence. Up to this time the seat had been transferred from one city to another accord ing to the will of the Patriarch or the chance of events. The successors of St. Gregory, down to Joseph, eleventh patriarch, had resided in the city of Vagarschabad, the ancient capital of Armenian royalty. When this city fell into the power ofthe Persians, in 452, they took refuge at Tevin, which then became the second capital of the kingdom, and there they continued to reside tdl the end u When the Greeks and Latins were disputing about the pr of the Holy Ghost, the Armenian Church declared for the former. * The opinion that the Armenians hold concerning the two natures in Jesus Christ is not that of Eutyches himself, but of some of his dis ciples. It consists in supposing that the two natures in Jesus Christ form but one after their union.

Tevin, in its turn, was conquered by the Seldjeucide Turks ; and the king, Aschod III., who had already removed nis court to Ani, summoned his patriarchs to that city, where they remained till 1113. After this the patriarchs were often obliged by the neces sities of the time to change their residence, and to move from one city to another on the banks of the Euphrates. The} eventually (in 1394) fixed their residence at Sis ; and had no other seat up to the death of the Patriarch Joseph III. (1440). His successor, Gregory IX., having made some inno vations in his church, four bishops of Cilicia drew up a letter addressed to the whole Armenian clergy, com plaining of his conduct, and of the deplorable state of the see of Sis, and proposing to transfer the patriarchal residence to Eczmiazin. In order to effect this, a very numerous assembly, composed of bishops, heads of monas teries, anchorets, and ordinary priests, met at Eczmiazin itself, and, as Gregory persisted in remaining at Sis, they proceeded to the election of a new patriarch. The choice fell on Cyriac, abbot of the monastery of Virap, who con tinued the series of universal patriarchs, and exercised, hke his successors, a full jurisdiction over the whole Armenian Church, whilst henceforward the patriarchs of Sis were considered as only of secondary rank.s * The Patriarch of Eczmiazin has always been considered as the cato ghigos or universal. It is pretended that this church owes its pre eminence to a miraculous translation of an arm of St. Gregory the Illu minator in a reliquiary of the cathedral.

There had been up to this time ninety-two patriarchs successors of St. Gregory. We shall only mention Narses, or Nersis, the Great (364), who merited this title by his virtues and the useful reforms he introduced into the church and nation ; and Moses IL, founder of the Arme nian era, the commencement of which was fixed by him at the year 552. He was also the framer of a calendar, to regulate the annual period for the celebration of Easter and the other festivals of the church ; according to which the year was divided into twelve months, of thirty days each, the 11th of August being considered as the first day of the year ; the five days remaining at the end of the year v- ere counted as supernumerary, or avelik. From the removal of the patriarchal seat to Eczmiazin down to the year 1780, at which date the chronology of Serpos stops, a new series of forty patriarchs may be reck oned. Several of these were eminent men, but none have approached in merit or reputation Nersis, archbishop of Georgia, who succeeded the patriarch John in 1843, being then more than seventy years of age. This prelate, who has left an admirable name for beneficence, sagacity, and firmness, whilst occupying the metropolitan see of Georgia, had founded at Tiflis a school (which has now become celebrated throughout the East), a caravanserai, the finest and most spacious in all the Georgian provinces ; and he was actively occupying himself in the reform of the churches subject to his jurisdiction, when he- was involved in the disgrace of General Yermoloff.

Cliardin, who visited it at the end of the seventeenth century, has given a very detailed de scription of it, which is equally applicable at the present day. The name of Eczmiazin is Armenian, and signifies \" the descent of the only-begotten Son ; \" the Mahometans call it Uteh-Eclisse, or the Three Churches, because there are two other monasteries contiguous to that of Eczmiazin, the residence of the patriarch. Of thirty-three villages which were formerly dependent on the patriarch, he now retains only three. His revenues have diminished in the same proportion. They are derived from a personal tax of one ducat per head, and of a twen tieth part ofthe general produce. Pilgrimages and elee mosynary grants constitute also another resource of the convent of Eczmiazin, which contains within its cloisters twelve bishops and from forty-five to fifty vartabieds, not including deacons. The principal prerogative of the patriarch, and that which in a manner constitutes his spiritual supremacy, is the consecration of the holy chrism. The rites which accompany this ceremony, one of the most important of the Armenian Church, bear some affinity to the ancient 6 Revue de l'Orient, 1843, vol. i. p. 289.

Mass is celebrated during forty days, and on the last day the catoghigos himself officiates in ponti fical pomp, and surrounded by all his clergy. The arm of St. Gregory the Enlightener being then plunged into the caldron, the contents immediately begin to boil ; the consecration is effected, and the \" holy chrism \" is pre served in jars to be distributed among all the churches of the Armenian faith. Sis and Agthamar also compound the \" holy chrism ; \" but Eczmiazin owes to the arm of St. Gregory the exclusive privilege of supplying it to the Armenians of Constantinople ; and the patriarchs of the other sees are obliged to mingle the holy chrism of Ecz miazin with their own in order to perfect the consecration. What are we to think of this miraculous ebullition ? According to the accounts of travellers who fonnerly visited Eczmiazin, the secret lay in a powder which the priests of the church introduced into the oil at the moment of the immersion of the arm of the Enlightener. But it appears that latterly, the Catoghigos having abandoned these equivocal practices, the consecration no longer takes place in public. The monastery of Eczmiazin formerly possessed a rich library, which has been much damaged and partially destroyed by the ravages of time and of war.

The see of Constantinople had scarcely existed a century and a half, when Joachim, archbishop of Broussa, was summoned thither by Mohammed H., eight years after the taking of the city. We find it mentioned for the first time in the acts of the council of Sis, held 1307, where the name of a certain Hesychius figures among those of the bishops present, bearing the title of bishop of Stimbola (Stamboul). The temporal privileges ac corded to the new archbishop greatly augmented tlie importance of the see of Constantinople, and his suc cessors, having obtained from the Catoghigos of Ecz miazin the right of consecrating and distributing the holy chrism to the different churches placed under their jurisdiction, hastened to assume the title of Patriarch in order to place themselves on an equality with the Greek patriarch. This practice has been continued ever since,"], [313, "Letter V. 277 PREUAITAL CHURCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE. although the title itself is purely honorary. In an eccle siastical point of view, the Patriarch \u2014or, to speak more strictly, the Primate \u2014 of Constantinople is only a simple bishop, dependent on the Catoghigos of Eczmiazin, and the supremacy he exercises over his suffragans is entirely derived from his residence in the capital. He neither ordains them, nor interferes with their administration ; his office is limited to representing them at the Porte, and being the medium through whom they receive their bairats. The present primate received in 1850, from the Patriarch of Eczmiazin, an authorization to wear the \" Gonker ;\" but merely as a personal distinction, and not as in right of his title, nor to be transmitted to his successors. The election of the patriarch is conducted in the same manner as that of the Greek patriarch. In case of the death or deposition of the titular, the Porte issues a firman, commanding the election of a new pontiff, and appoints a functionary of the government to be present at the election in quality of commissioner. The chiefs cf the esnafs and the notables assemble either at the patriarchal palace or in the church, and the choice is made by accla mation. The vote by ballot is ordered by the Imperial commissioner only when there is reason to apprehend that the assembly may be turbulent. The expenses of the bairat are defrayed by the national treasury, in order to obviate the intrigues and other abuses which we have pointed out when speaking of the Greek Church.

The revenues of the patriarchal see are not fixed ; they vary from one hundred thousand to one hundred and twenty thousand piastres a year, and they arise chiefly from the dues of the bishops and from voluntary contributions of the faithful In addition to the above, a sum of three thousand piastres a month is allotted from the national treasury for the expenditure of the patri archal household. The patriarch is assisted by an ecclesiastical council (hoquever gioghouk), composed of thirteen ecclesiastical members, bishops, vartabieds, and priests, and two lay members, one of whom fills the post of secretary. This councd has power to take cognizance of all abuses in church discipline, to elect bishops for the whole extent of the empire, but not to ordain though it may depose them (episcopal ordination must proceed from Eczmiazin) ; it also exercises a superintendence over seminaries and schools.

They receive no pay, with tbe exception of the secretary, who is also secretary to the civil council, and who from his two offices derives a monthly stipend of about 700 piastres. III. Of the Bishoprics of Turco- Armenia The number of bishops dependent on the see of Con stantinople is not fixed. A diocese is sometimes intrusted"], [315, "Letter V. BISHOPRICS OF TURCO- ARMENIA. 279 to a simple doctor in theology, or \" vartabied,\" as in the case of the present titular of the diocese of C\u00e6sarea (in Cappadocia), whilst on the other hand bishops of long standing may subside into abbots and superiors of monas teries. At the present day the number of Armenian dioceses is thirty-six, including that of Agthamar, besides many monasteries, which enjoy the title of bishoprics. Of these thirty-six, three only belong to Turkey in Europe : those of Rodosto, Varna, and Adrianople. The most important in point of population is the diocese of Mouch, which ex tends from the city of Mouch to the confines of Diarbekir, and contains more than one hundred towns and villages, with a population of fifteen thousand families. Next in order is Erzeroum, containing two cities, Erzeroum and Khenous, and about fifty towns and vil lages, with a population of from eleven to twelve thousand families. Next come the dioceses of C\u00e6sarea and Nicomedia, each containing about ten thousand families, and numerous villages, many of which are inhabited exclusively by Armenians. After these, the following stand in the order of their relative importance : Van, Tokat, Varna in Roumelia (which has under its jurisdiction the Armenians of the Danubian provinces and those of Bessarabia, Transyl vania, and Hungary) ; Sivas, Arabkir, united in 1851 with the diocese of Koule-Vank, an ancient abbey ; Eguin, Amasia, Trebisond, united to the two sees of Hunie and Seboah in 1851 ; Chabin Kara-Hicjar, Angora, Erzingan, Baibourt, Palou, Hassan-Kale, and Gazmi"], [316, "Letter V. 280 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Vank, long since united ; Agthamar, Smyrna, Diarbekir, Edirne (Adrianople), Baiazid. Bidlis, Ourfa, Kars, Bagdad, Broussa, united to Kutahiain 1852 ; Banderma, Terdjan, Kighi, Rodosto, Ardjuk, Tadem, and Sourp- Daniel, near C\u00e6sarea, formed of three or four villages, whose population barely amounts to a thousand families. Among the monasteries which enjoy the title and privileges of bishoprics, we may mention those of Naregue ; of Arakefotz-Vank, or monastery of the Holy Apostles, near Mouch ; Arghiri, situated on the summit of a mountain near Diarbekir ; of Tchunguchet and Ab delmesseh, near Palou ; of Aluri-Vank, near Van ; of Sourp-Sahag, near Mouch ; another of the same name near Van ; and Tchartchaganatz-Vank, near Erzingan. In the dioceses of Van, Mouch, Erzingan, and Eguin, there are also many monasteries, administered by the bishops of the nearest cities, who sometimes reside in them : such are the monasteries of Armach and Sourp-Garabied (St. Charles), the residences of the Bishops of Nicomedia and C\u00e6sarea. The number of these monastery-bishoprics cannot, however, be precisely stated, because it often happens that the titular of the adjoining see appropriates the monastery and all its dependencies, and subjects it to his own administration. This was the case with the monastery of Koule-Vank, which, within the last two years, has come to form part of the bishopric of Arabkir. The election of the bishops, like that of all the Ar menian clergy, takes place by universal suffrage. When a particular church requires a bishop, the clergy send a deputation or address a petition to the patriarch at Con-"], [317, "Letter V. 281 INFERIOR CLERGY. stantinople, with a list of candidates, setting forth the merits of each. The patriarch submits this list to the eccles' istical council, which makes its choice. The newly-elected bishop is then summoned to Constanti nople, where he undergoes a rigid examination, after which, if he is judged competent, his nomination takes place according to the ceremonies prescribed by the ritual. IV. Of the Inferior Clergy. The bishops, in their turn, ordain those who are simply priests, in which order are comprehended the ordinary priests (derders) and the vartabieds, or doctors in theology. The latter are divided into two classes, the greater and the lesser vartabieds, and again subdivided into fourteen degrees, which each candidate must successively pass before he can reach the summit of the doctorial hierarchy. The vartabieds form the most enlightened and learned portion of the Armenian clergy. They are restricted to celibacy, whilst the ordinary priests are permitted to marry, and they carry, as a distinctive mark of their rank, a sort of caduceus, made of some precious wood and elaborately carved. The ranks of the Armenian priesthood are generally recruited from the class of poor artisans, and no previous studies are required to fit the candidate for ordination. When a parish is in want of a priest, information is given to the mutevelli, or administrator of the pious foundations belonging to the church ; and if the latter (who is a lay man, and generally chosen from among the most influ-"], [318, "Letter V. 282 LETTERS ON TURKEY. ential persons of the parish) should happen to have on hand some indigent follower, who can read and write tolerably, he immediately recommends him to the suf frages of the faithful, and the election proceeds without delay. It is needless to say that the candidate of the mutevelli is always adopted by the assembly, which, in the same sitting, prepares a petition to the patriarch, requesting him to confer the order of priesthood on the object of their choice. This petition is signed by the preacher and officiating clergy of the parish church, by the mutevelli, and by all the parishioners. The patriarch, considering the testimony of the petitioners a sufficient guarantee for the moral character of the candidate, occu pies himself only in ascertaining whether he possess the necessary qualifications and attainments. If the result _>f the investigation be favourable \u2014 a result which is gene rally secured by the powerful protection of the mutevelli \u2014 the public examination of the candidate takes place on the following Saturday, after vespers, according to the ritual ; the candidate having in the interval received the minor orders, including that of deacon. The examination is a mere formality, the candidate replying to the ques tions of the patriarch and bishop by reciting certain formulae of the ritual previously committed to memory. After it is over, he passes the night in the church, in repeating such prayers and hymns as have been pre scribed by the bishop, and on the following day he is consecrated to the priesthood. It is needless to expatiate on the abuses of such a method of ordination. Many of the patriarchs, justly alarmed at the dangers incurred by the church under a system so cor-"], [319, "283 Letter V. ORDINARY PRIESTHOOD. rupt, have made praiseworthy efforts to reform its abuses, and have even refused to confer the priesthood on any candidate whatever whilst the conditions of ordination should remain in their present defective state ; but the old system, being regarded as a prerogative of the grandees of the nation, has always maintained its ground. Some improvements have, however, been introduced during the last few years ; and although the candidates for the sacerdotal order are not yet required to possess any very profound learning, it is considered essential that they shoidd be able to write, and should know enough of the literary language of Armenia to understand the ritual and other ecclesiastical books, which are written in that idiom. Unfortunately this laudable precaution has brought forward an abuse of another kind -. for now, if a candidate of respectable acquirements present himself (a circumstance which excites the jealousy of the low ignorant clergy, and therefore rare), he is received at once, and obtains his ordination, without sufficient in vestigation as to his orthodoxy or moral conduct. Still, however, the improvements which have been gradually, and in some respects rapidly, taking place in the Arme nian nation, afford hope that these two essential objects may eventually be combined ; and that henceforth those candidates only will be received whose attainments are respectable, and whose orthodoxy and morality are exempt from reproach. The dissatisfaction of the Armenians with the present condition of their clergy in general, and the consideration enjoyed by the very few priests who combine learning and morality of life, may be regarded as a sign of future amendment on all points."], [320, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter V. 284 The new priest, as soon as he is ordained, returns to the church, where he remains secluded from all inter course, except with the old priests who are charged with initiating him iuto his sacerdotal functions. During this period he must neither quit the precincts of the church nor officiate nor celebrate mass ; and is only permitted to take one meal during the twenty-four hours, and that at sunset. Fish and all kinds of meat are prohibited. He must recite the whole of the Psalter daily, with the addition of various hymns and prayers ; and also read fifteen or twenty chapters of the New Testament, together with a sort of breviary called Narcque. The rest of his time is devoted to the study of the ritual, and of all the details relative to the ceremonies of the church, &c. Some years ago the obligations imposed on newly-ordained priests during this ordeal of forty days were far more strict and rigorous. They were forbidden to shave, to pare their nads, or to change their linen, and were required to lead the life of anchorites of old ; but latterly the severity of these observ ances has been greatly modified by the bishops. At the expiration of the forty days the bishop appoints a time for the new priest to celebrate his first mass, which is generally fixed to take place on a Sunday or some festival. The wife of a married priest is not permitted to attend the mass, nor even to be present in the church, when her husband officiates. As the newly-ordained priest receives no salary, and is not entitled, during forty days more, to share in the ecclesiastical revenue of the church to which he if attached, he is allowed during the interval to say a great number of masses, the fees of which are allotted to his benefit."], [321, "Letter V. 285 ORDINARY PRIESTHOOD. The Armenian clergy receive no stipends, aud exact no contributions like those of the Greek Church ; their revenues depend entirely on the voluntary contributions of the faith ful ; it is therefore rare to meet with a wealthy priest, though some few are in easy circumstances. The Armenians have no parochial churches, properly so called, but the patriarch assigns to every priest a certain number of families within the district of the church to which he is appointed, aud to whom he thenceforward becomes in a manner the chaplain. No one but himself has the right of confessing their mem bers, of administering the communion, celebrating mass in their private residences on Sundays, &c. ; and if one of the families should remove to another parish, no priest of the latter can u.-urp his duties, unless in a case of emer gency, when, if another priest is called in, he is obliged to divide the payment of his ministry with the appointed priest of the family. Neither the patriarch nor any of the bishops have a right to dues or contributions from the inferior clergy, nor can they exact any payments from the people, excepting fees for baptisms, marriages, and fune rals ; these fees are fixed by a tariff which has been settled by the patriarch or bishop, and of which a printed copy is placed in every church : the diocesan authorities are very careful that this tariff shall not be exceeded. Twice every year \u2014 at the feasts of Epiphany and Easter, periods at which an interchange of visits and presents takes place in Armenia, as in France and some other countries on the anniversary of the new year \u2014 the priest makes a round of the families under his charge, reads a hymn adapted to the occasion, with the Gospel ofthe day, and receives a present from the master of the house."], [322, "Letter V. 286 LETTERS ON TURKEY. These donations are generally employed by the receivers of them in administering to the necessities of the poorer brethren of their flock\u2014 a charity for which their own poverty allows them no other opportunity throughout the year ; but, tbe gift being purely voluntary, the priest is not permitted to demand anything beyond what is freely offered. Should he transgress in this particular he would incur a reprimand, and probably a more serious penalty, from the superior authorities. Owing to such wise restric tions as the above, the shameful abuses of the Devri* \u2014 of simony and other scandals which dishonour the Greek clergy \u2014 are unknown among that of Armenia. With respect to morals also, though it is difficult to pronounce absolutely on the subject, the Armenian clergy appears to be very superior to the Greek. The bishops exercise a vigilant control over the conduct of the priests, and punish every transgression with severity. The sources of ecclesiastical revenue are various, and are both fixed and casual. Of the former are the vacoufs, or pious foundations, which generally consist in dwellings, shops, or warehouses, which the church either lets on lease or sells : in the latter case, if the purchaser happens to die without direct heirs, the property returns to the church. The sale of wax candles, strange as it may appear, is also a profitable source of emolument ; it is exercised by virtue of a charter granted by Sultan Mahmoud, about twenty years since ; up to that time none but Musulmans could manufacture or sell wax candles in Turkey. One of the principal officers of the mint at Constantinople, * See Letter II."], [323, "287 Letter V. THE MONASTIC CLERGY. Artin Bezdjan, an Armenian, being in great favour with the Sultan, succeeded in obtaining a ferman authorising the establishment of a wax-candle manufactory for the exclusive use of the churches, and for the benefit of the Armenian hospital of Ycdi-Koule (the Seven Towers). Every parish in Constantinople and the provinces is con sequently obliged to provide itself from this manufactory with wax candles and tapers, which are afterwards sold at the doors of the churches to the faithful, for the pur pose of being lighted as an offering before the high altar, or the picture of some favourite saint, according to the custom prevalent in all the churches of the East. A sub scription is also made twice a year to supply the oil re quired for the consumption of the church, each person contributing according to his means.

Of the Monastic Clergy. Armenian monasteries in considerable numbers still exist in Turkey ; their foundations date in general from a remote period ; but more than half are now deserted, and some are entirely crumbling into ruins. The life of the monks who inhabit these monasteries is not less austere than that of the caloyers of Athos :9 they take only one meal in the twenty-four hours, and that \" See Letter II. pa^'o 1-14."], [324, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter V. 288 consists of herbs and pulse, simply boiled and seasoned with a little salt. On Saturdays and Sundays, however, they indulge in the luxuries of oil, milk, and fish, in addition to their usual diet. The period of the noviciate is very long and very severe ; sometimes, indeed, the sacerdotal habit is not assumed till after eight years' probation. The forty days immediately following its investiture are passed in abso lute solitude, silence, and seclusion even from the light of day. Among the principal monasteries of Turco-Armenia are those of Sis and of St. Cross in the island of Agthamar, in lake Van ; they are the residences of the respective patriarchs of Sis and Agthamar. The jurisdiction of the latter, as we have elsewhere seen, is inconsiderable, ex- tending only over four large towns and several smaller ones, inclusive of some villages on the borders of the lake of Van ; it includes also certain bishoprics, one of which, that of Aluri-Vank, is at the same time both bishopric and monastery. The monasteries of Lim and Guedouz are situated on two other small islands of the same lake. These islands, as well as the island of Agthamar, are exclusively inhabited by monks. From time to time the Economos or steward of each monastery visits the main- land in order to purchase various necessaries for the com- munity, small boats being kept on the lake for the pur pose; and though the islands are the resort (Agthamar especially) of crowds of pilgrims from all parts of Armenia, there is no record that on any of them the foot of woman has ever been placed. Ancient regulations, still in force, forbid the brethren ofthe monasteries of Lim and Guedouz"], [325, "Letter V. ARMENIAN MONASTERIES. 289 from becoming candidates for any episcopal dignity, except under a dispensation from the Catoghigos of Eczmiazin. Neither science nor literature is much cultivated by these recluses, who are even forbidden to possess any book except the liturgies and works on ascetic theology. Formerly, indeed, the rule on this point was much less rigorous than at present, and Father Nerses Peghlou, one of the most eminent restorers of philosophic science in Armenia, was a monk of the convent of Lim. The pre sent abbot, Father Agop Topouz, is himself a man of learning, and, notwithstanding the intellectual darkness in which he endeavours to keep his monks, several of them are respectable scholars. The revenues of Lim, Guedouz, and Agthamar are derived from salt-pits (salines) on the shores of the Lake Van ; from certain lands with which the faithful have at various periods endowed the church ; and from collections made at stated periods in the Armenian churches of Russia and Persia, as well as Turkey, for the benefit of these monasteries ; the islands on which they are respec tively situated being in themselves totally unproductive. The convent of St. James at Jerusalem is the resi dence of the Armenian bishop of that city, who enjoys, as we have stated above, the title and insignia of patri arch. This is the richest of the Armenian monasteries, either in Turkey or elsewhere, by reason of the great confluence of pilgrims from all parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa to Jerusalem ; none of wdiom quit the monastery without leaving an offering in return for the hospitality which they have received. This hospitality is freely given, and no payment demanded or expected for anything VOL. II. O"], [326, "Letter V. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 290 except for the rent of a room, for which 250 piastres (\u202221. 6s. Sd.) is always charged, whether it be occupied for a day, a month, or a year. This sum includes also a jar of wine, containing seven or eight quarts, which is distributed weekly to each pilgrim by the monks. The monastery derives likewise considerable revenues from the Vacoufs ' which it possesses in different parts of Armenia, from the produce of alms collected in the churches, and from voluntary donations sent by the faith ful through the medium of the pilgrims. If there be any overplus, it is applied to the benefit of the nation, and contributes to the endowment of schools, hospitals, and other establishments of public utility ; as for example, in 1851, tbe monastery of St. James, at Jerusalem, lent five hundred thousand piastres, without interest, to assist the hospital of Yeni-Kouleh. Attached to the monastery is a seminary, the scholars of which are instructed, lodged, fed, and clothed gratuitously ; there is likewise a school and a printing-press, tlie latter the gift of M. Bedros Youssouf, a wealthy Armenian merchant, who resided at Trieste, and several of the valuable MS. treasures of the library have been given to the world through the medium of this press. The monastery of St. John the Baptist, near Mouch, is much frequented by pilgrims, and is endowed with a considerable number of vacoufs, farms, and villages, from which it receives tithes ; within these few years a school has been annexed to it. The monasteries of Angora and Tokal, residences of the bishops of these two localities, and the monastery of 1 See vol. i. Letter xii."], [327, "Letter V. ARMENIAN MONASTERIES. 291 Marsuam, are all likewise places of pilgrimage, but are less wealthy. They derive their revenues from the lands cultivated by the monks or let out in farms ; from a cer tain number of flour-mills ; and from the voluntary con tributions ofthe surrounding villages, over which, however, they possess no jurisdiction. A seminary also is an nexed to this monastery. The monastery of Armach, near Nicomedia, seat of the bishop of that city, contains a school, where the children of the villages subject to the bishop's jurisdiction are fed, clothed, and taught gratui tously, on condition of their afterwards devoting them selves to the priesthood, or becoming teachers in the country itself. The revenues of this monastery, though modest in amount, suffice for its maintenance. The monastery of St. John the Baptist, near C\u00e6sarea, formerly the residence of the bishop, to whose jurisdiction it is subject, has been highly venerated from time im memorial as a resort for pilgrims. Till within the last two years it possessed a seminary, which has lately been closed and replaced by a well-managed school, situated at Talos, a village near the city. The wealth of this monastery is not equal to its reputation; its revenues barely sufficing for its support. There are many Armenian convents of minor im portance : amongst them are those of Sebouh, in the diocese of Huuia ; of Dadasgui-Vank, of St. Narses, of St Gregory the Enlightener, in the diocese of Erzingan ; of Sirikli, in that of Terdjan ; of St. Georges Pontgou, of St. Sahag, of Eresina, of St. Sahag Loussabdough, of St. Croix de Varak and Naregue, in that of Van ; of Ameredal, of Avekhou-Vank, of Khintragadar, of o2"], [328, "Letter V.

I. Statistics of the Armenian Community. The persecutions, the wars, the emigrations, and the calamities of all kinds to which the Armenians have been subjected for many centuries, have caused them to be compared, not unaptly, to the Jews. Like that people they present the phenomenon of a race dispersed through out all countries of the globe, and still preserving a dis tinct national existence, though their political existence has long been annihilated. Intermingling, but never becoming incorporated, with the people of other countries; like the Israelites engaged in monetary transactions and affairs of commerce ; like them immutably attached to their hereditary faith, and constantly cherishing in secret the hope of their national restoration, the Armenians are to be met with in most commercial cities throughout Europe and Asia, from Amsterdam and Venice to Ispahan"], [330, "Letter VI. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 294 and Madras, though the bulk ofthe nation continues to dwell in Turkey. It is difficult to form an exact estimate of the number of Armenians in the Ottoman empire. The statement which I have given from official calculation, and which raises the numbers to an average of two million four hundred thousand, is only an approximate computation, and probably below the truth. In fact, when ten years ago the Porte ordered a census to be taken throughout the empire, a report was immediately circulated that the object of this measure was to enable the government to impose a new tax on each locality proportionate to its population. The greater part of the Armenian provinces, therefore, believing that their interests required them to represent their numbers as few as possible, scrupled not to make fictitious returns, and these not to the Turkish authorities only, but likewise to their own bishops and patriarchs, whom they regarded, in this affair, as the agents of the Porte. It should be further observed, that the returns got up on this occasion included only the male population who were liable to the kharadj, and that females, children under seven years of age, old men above seventy, ecclesiastics, students in the seminaries, together with infirm and insane persons, beggars, and those who happened to be absent from their homes, were all omitted. To supply this deficiency, it was proposed that the number of those who actually paid the kharadj should be multiplied by four, and the result, which amounted to six hundred thousand, would, it was thought, give an accurate return. Other statisticians of Constan tinople suggested a plan which proved not less full of"], [331, "POPULATION. 295 error. We have seen that every Armenian priest has under his spiritual (jharge a certain number of families, who form, as it were, his fief ; a register of these families is deposited in the archives of each diocese, which is bound to send a duplicate to the patriarchate at Con stantinople. An average of five individuals for a family was fixed on ; the total was to be multiplied by five : but this suggestion overlooked the impossibility of esta blishing a parity between the rural and the city popula tions. In the former, families of three and four gene rations, including often thirty or forty persons, dwell together under one roof, and are reckoned as one family ; in the towns each household is distinct, each son, as he marries, establishing himself in a home of his own. It results, therefore, that the amount of two million four hundred thousand, at which the Armenian population in Turkey is usually reckoned, is likewise below the truth. It appears also, from the enumeration of the bishoprics and larger monasteries which I have made above, that the population is distributed in an unequal manner through the empire. The Armenians inhabiting Turkey in Europe are scarcely four hundred thousand, of which more than half reside at Constantinople ; the others are scattered through Thrace and Bulgaria, forming the three bishoprics of Rodosto, Adrianople, and Varna. On the other hand, Turkey in Asia contains not less than two millions of Armenians, the majority of whom still inhabit the ancient territory of their forefathers in the neighbourhood of Mount Ararat ; the three Eyalets (governments) of Erzeroum, Diarbekir, and Kurdistan,"], [332, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter VI. 296 contain many villages peopled entirely by Armenians; and in these provinces, notwithstanding frequent migra tions, the Armenians preserve a numerical superiority over the Turkish and Turcoman races. In several of these villages, particularly in the neigh bourhood of Erzeroum, we find the inhabitants literally dwelling underground ;' their houses, if houses they can be called, being scooped out beneath the surface, and only accessible by an opening like the mouth of a well, recalling in every particular the description given by Xenophon, and exhibiting the same features now as in the time of the retreat of the Ten Thousand.2 The mountain district of the pashalic of Moussoul, towards the Russian frontier, is inhabited by a race of Armenians who are styled Zei'toun,3 from the nature of the country they occupy, which is covered with vast groves of olive-trees. The origin of these tribes is lost in antiquity, and the number of their population is un known. Several Armenians of Constantinople, from whom I sought information on the subject, gave me various ' These subterraneous habitations are constructed not on the side of i >ut of a gentle slope, and all the earth excavated from ti- ls thrown back again upon the roof, in such a manner that on three sides there is often no sign of any dwelling existing underneath.

There is no fence to keep people off the roof, which has no appearance different from the surrounding country.

When an inhabitant of the Ze'itoun happens to visit the capital \u2014 which is, however, a rare occurrence, and prompted generally by the need of seeking teachers for their schools \u2014 he avoids with the utmost care and dexterity all interrogations concerning his country, being persuaded that the safety of his fellow-countrymen would be compromised if strangers became acquainted with their numbers and resources. The environs of Boli, in Cappadocia, offer another example, no less interesting and curious, of a ra'iah popu lation in Turkey exercising a self-government distinct from the general authority, and under the sanction and shelter of the law. The traveller Fontanier relates that at the time Persia was devastated by intestine wars and commotions, after the death of Nadir-Shah, a number of Armenian families fled from their country, and implored the protection of the Porte. A suburb adjoining the city of Boli was granted them, together with certain privi leges and immunities \u2014 amongst others, that of enclosing their dwellings with walls and gates, through which no Musulman was allowed to pass. The village built by the first settlers is still inhabited exclusively by Christians ; their numbers are about five hundred ; they have a church, and are exempt from all contributions and im posts except the kharadj. Thus they enjoy a large amount of freedom, and their village has become a retreat for all Christians seeking a refuge from oppression, includ ing those even who may chance to be in the service of the pasha of the district himself.4 Besides the Armenians in 4 Fontanier, Voyage en Orient, p. 307. o3"], [334, "Letter VI. 298 LETTERS ON TURKEY. the Ottoman empire, there are great numbers residing in Russia, Persia, and the principal trading towns of Asia and Europe. According to the statement of M. Berg haus, of Potsdam, the Armenians in Russia amount to five hundred and eighty thousand, whilst the editors of the ' Almanack de Gotha ' reckon them at one million. The greater part of these inhabit the province of Erivan, which is a fragment of the ancient kingdom of Armenia. The small city of Nakhitchevan, in the government of Ekaterinslav, founded in 1781 by Armenian families transplanted from the Crimea, and which has become the centre of a brisk commerce, is still exclusively Arme- nian. Klaproth, in his 'Travels,' has some interesting pages relative to this place.5 The Armenians in Persia may be reckoned at about 600,000 individuals, scattered principally over the north west part of the kingdom. Close to Ispahan, forming, in fact, a suburb of the city itself, we find the Armenian colony of Julfa; this colony forms a distinct and inde pendent church, governed by its own patriarch. In 1603 Shah Abbas, having taken the town of Julfa in Armenia by assault, destroyed it entirely, and, carrying off twenty three thousand families, placed them in the suburbs of his capital, where the unfortunate exiles built a town, which they called after the name of their native city. It is supposed that thirty thousand Armenians are to be found in the cities of Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta ; whilst Armenian brokers and their agents cross the Ganges, and penetrate even to Birmah, Siam, and the English 1 Klaproth, Voyage au Mont Caucase et en Georgie, vol. i. p. 65."], [335, "Letter VI.

In Europe we find them scattered throughout Austria, Italy, and Holland, so inter mixed with the rest of the population that it is difficult to arrive at any distinct account, of their numbers.

Government and Administration. The civil government of the Armenian community is vested in two authorities \u2014 the Patriarch and the Civil Council. The Civil Council (caghacagan gioghouk) is com posed of twenty members, elected for two years, like the members of the ecclesiastical council, the election being vested in the esnafs, and confirmed by the Sublime Porte. The authority of the civil council, placed intermediately between the Ottoman government and the Armenian nation, extends over all the Armenians of the empire ; though this authority, or rather the abuse of this authority, is sometimes pushed so far as to invade the spiritual func-"], [336, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter VI. 300 tions and privileges of the bishops, and sometimes even to depose them, contrary to the canon law. For all such encroachments, however, tbe patriarchs themselves are in a great measure to blame, since it depends on themselves to exercise a proper degree of firmness in determining the precise nature and extent of the power belonging to the civil councd, and the limits of its intervention in diocesan administration. \\11 reports transmitted by the Armenian patriarch to the Porte require the seal of the civil council The keeper of the seal, styled Logothetes, ranks next to the patriarch. and presides over the council in his abser The attributes of the Armenian patriarch are very similar to those of the Greek \u0153cumenical patriarch. He dispenses justice, not in person, but by his delegate, or vicar-general (pochanort).

The nation and the Armenian community are subject to no taxes by the Ottoman government except the kharadj, aud the ordinary impost paid to the state. We have already seen how the ecclesiastical expenses are supplied. Other expenses, such as judicial fees and salaries, the maintenance of schools and hospitals, &c, are defrayed from the proceeds of voluntary contributions paid into the public treasury.

Three other churches, situated in the neighbourhood of Koum-Capou, Goudik-Pasha, Yeni- Capou, and Koum-Capou, include a like number. The parish of Balata alone contains three thousand families. With regard to the proportion between the number of churches and the general number of the population, we shall find the average to be a little more than seven thou sand individuals for each parish. Public Education. Every parish has its free school, in which the children of the district learn to read and write. Originally these schools were supported at the expense of the parish ; but the parochial revenues proving insufficient, the Patriarch Carabed placed each of them under the administration of an esnaf. In a few years the esnafs also becoming unable or unwilling to continue the expense, the principal inha bitants of the different quarters of the city united together to undertake the charge. The inhabitants of Psammatia, in 1842, set the first example of these voluntary associa- at Pera ; that of the hospital of Yem-Kouleh ; that of the ancient plague hospital, contiguous to the preceding ; that of Tersancti, for criminals condemned to the galleys, in the interior of tbe prison of the Marcn^h ; and, lastly, the little church of San Stefano, two leagues from Con stantinople, erected at his own residence for the use of the workmen, by M.

LETTERS ON TURKEY. 304 tions\u2014 an example readily followed by other parishes ; but such associations, from their very nature, cannot offer any guarantee of permanency, so that, after all, the schools remain in a precarious state of existence. The instruction afforded in them is very limited, being confined in general to reading, writing, the elements of arithmetic, and the catechism, and (for children on whom nature has bestowed a voice) a httle instruction in church music. Some few indeed, besides the foregoing rudiments, teach a little grammar, geography, and history, and a smattering of mathematics ; but their number is very inconsiderable ; and the greater part of the pupils, who generally belong to poor families, have scarcely learned to read and write before they are removed by their parents and apprenticed to some trade. In 1837 a college was founded at Scutari, which, like all establishments of public charity and utility in the Ar menian community, was supported by voluntary donations and subscriptions. Scarcely, however, had it begun to prosper, when party intrigues and jealousies interfered, and at the end of three years and a half the experi ment was obliged to be given up, and the college doors closed. They were reopened in 1846, to be again closed in 1852 ; and the locality was transformed into a primary school, succursal to that of the church of St. John the Baptist, which had been burned down. A few years ago a similar attempt was made to establish a college within the precincts of the great hospital of Yeni-Kouleh, intended to serve also as a seminary for the education of the Vartabieds. This experiment succeeded no better than the former, and in hke manner terminated"], [341, "Letter VT. PUBLIC EDUCATION. 305 in a simple school of primary instruction, which, at the time of my last visit to Constantinople, was supported on a costly scale, the pupils being lodged and boarded in the establishment. The education of the female sex is still less advanced. The few schools which exist at Constantinople and its neighbourhood are of not more than fifty years' standing. Before that time a woman who possessed the slightest knowledge of reading or writing was certain to be regarded with an evil eye by her companions, and marriage for such a phenomenon was almost out of the question. The Armenian Catholics were the first, to break through this prejudice, and mention is made of a certain Mariam Karakachian, about the beginning of the seven teenth century, who had translated from the Latin several collections of sermons. Subsequently this example was followed by the non-united Armenians. In 1821 the sister of M. Djanig, an Armenian sarraf,7 sounded and endowed in the quarter of Psammatia the first school for girls, and at the present day there are similar schools in almost every parish of Constantinople ; also at Broussa, Varna, Adapasa (in the diocese of Nicomedia), at Baghtchedjig, an Armenian village on the Gulf of Nicomedia, and in most of the principal towns of Ar menia. The instruction given in these schools is restricted to reading, writing, arithmetic, the art of embroidery, and other feminine works : music and ornamental accom- plishments have not yet been introduced.

Under such disadvantages it might have been sup posed that literature and science could have made little progress amongst the Armenians. The contrary, however, is the fact. Originating at the most unfavourable epoch, at a time when the political decline of the kingdom had commenced, the literature of Armenia rapidly increased during the eighth century under the dominion of the Osdigan Arabs. By a curious contrast, we sometimes see the most calamitous periods of history the most remark able for intellectual development. The school of Mechitar, growing up amidst the lagunes of Venice, gave an impulse to Armenian language and literature which was communicated to the rest of the na tion, reaching even those who were dispersed over remote countries. Eleven Armenian printing establishments were at this period in existence amongst the principal cities of Europe : namely, one at Venice, established 1565 ; one 8 We have heard that a school for girls has been established at Con stantinople under the auspices of Lady Stratford de Redcliffe, conducted by some English Protestant ladies, and that many of the pupils are Armenians.

The talents of these distinguished men are unfortunately lost to the nation. Manuscripts accumulate under their pens, but remain buried in their closets for want of a publisher to incur the risk of printing them. Libraries are luxuries as yet unknown among the wealthy Ar menians. If by chance one of them purchases a book, all his acquaintances think themselves entitled to borrow it, and thus the same copy serves for fifteen or twenty families. An Armenian work, of which from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand copies should have been struck off, and the whole impression sold in the course of a few years, would be a prodigy of literary success- Armenian writers are, generally speaking, too poor to publish their works at their own expense, being indeed scarcely able to support themselves without the assistance of a professorship in a college or some employment in the civil administration The Armenians have a literary language which differs entirely from the spoken dialect, and is considered by their national writers as having existed before the Deluge ! However absurd this pretension may be deemed, it would be curious to follow, step by step, the changes which this language has undergone since the invention of the alphabet by Mesrob. In the seventeenth century, a few learned men, conceiving that the forms aud rules of Latin might be applied with advantage to the Armenian language, invented a sort of bastard dialect, which was partly adopted by the Armenians in Holland, and in which a small number of books appeared at Amsterdam. But this example has found few imitators, and the ancient"], [345, "Letter VI. 309 -LITERATURE AND SCIENCE. language, although degenerated from its primitive purity, has continued to prevail amongst the learned of Armenia. Towards the middle of the last century one of the dis ciples of Mechitar, Father Tchiamschian, attempted to restore the language by discarding all the foreign ele ments which had been introduced. His grammar, ampli fied and completed by the supplement of Father Gabriel Avedchian, was adopted by the nation, and, in conjunc tion with the classical works sent forth by the press of the Mechitarists, has contributed to form a literary lan guage totally distinct from the dialect in common use ; the latter having become corrupted by the introduction of words and idioms from the various languages of the surrounding nations, intermingled with the original Armenian. The Armenians of the Ottoman empire usually employ the Turkish language in conversation even amongst them selves, or, if they use their own, it is disfigured by a multitude of Turkish words introduced without necessity. In the same manner the Armenians in Georgia use Georgian expressions ; while those of Russia or Persia, Transylvania, and other countries, borrow phrases from the nations among whom they live. This corruption of the Armenian language by the heterogeneous admixture of foreign dialects has hitherto prevented the con struction of such a grammar as would give it a fixed and uniform character. Still, however, some attempts of the kind have been made at Constantinople, and not wholly without success. For example, there are three Armenian newspapers published in Turkey, \u2014 one at Smyrna, and two at Constantinople ; these are written in"], [346, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter VI. 310 the common Armenian dialect, as it is spoken at Con stantinople, without any admixture of foreign phrases, and this new style is beginning to grow daily more into use, though much has yet to be done before it can take its place amongst regular languages. The Classification of the Population. The Armenian community may be divided into four classes : the clergy ; the literary or professional class ; the sarrafs, or bankers ; and the artisans and tradesmen. We have already directed our attention to the two former : we have now only a few words to say respecting the two latter, which comprise the commerce and the industry of the nation. The occupation of the sarrafs ' is of very ancient origin in the Turkish empire, and arose out of the mode of collecting the taxes employed in the earlier times imme diately succeeding the conquest. It will be borne in mind that the Porte was anciently accustomed to farm out the different branches of the revenue to the pashas and other governors of provinces, who were required to pay the amount in advance into the Miri or Treasury, and these, in their turn, as Mr. Urquhart justly remarks, not having fortune or credit enough to furnish the neces sary guarantees, were obliged to have recourse to the Armenians.2 1 Sarraf, a money-changer or banker ; one who knows the value of things, particularly of specie. It is used figuratively in the following expression : \u2014 Sarraf ani nougoadi me'iini, those who know the value ofthe small change (inonnaie) of eloquence. \u2014 Bianchi, LUctiunnaii-e.

THE SARRAFS. 311 \" The pasha, being generally without personal pro perty or credit, and his office itself, on which rested the whole chance of repayment, being of most precarious tenure, it was necessary for him to grant very advan tageous conditions to the capitalist who should become his guarantee. Here we come to the secret spring which puts in motion the whole machinery of Turkish administration. \" The Armenians have been, and still are, the richest and most commercial people of the empire, and by their wealth they are the surest guarantees the Porte could obtain : by their knowledge of the Turkish language, by their intimate acquaintance with all commercial dealings, and by their condition of raiah, they offer to the pashas every quality that can recommend them as able men of business, as bankers of solidity, and as docile creditors. The revenues being often collected in kind, their capacity of merchant united to that of banker makes them doubly useful, and gives them opportunities of rapidly acquiring wealth. The Sultan views their prosperity with no un friendly eye, as their riches are not squandered by ex travagant habits, nor expended in rebellious enterprises, but remain carefully hoarded in their coffers till some pre text or some necessity brings it into the Miri. *' The confidential agent who accompanies the pasha to his province is generally a relation of the sarraf ; all money transactions pass through him, and the agrotege and commission are very considerable. This agent re ceives the revenue for the province for which his prin cipal has become responsible, and traffics in its produce,"], [348, "312 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter VI. which he manages to obtain at a reduced price as tribute by exaction, &c. Thus, to every pasha a steward is attached, like a sucking-fish to a shark, whom, let him writhe as he will, he cannot get rid of, who watches his movements, commands his resources, and, urging him con tinually to acts of violence and extortion, leaves him only a small portion of the plunder. The pasha cannot throw him off, because bis office depends on his guaranteeship ; he cannot induce him to plot against the Porte, because the bulk of the Armenian's fortune is at Constantinople, where also his family are retained as hostages. The principal evil of the system is that the sarrafs naturally wish to conceal from the pasha the amount of their profits, and this they most effectually do by collecting the revenue before harvest-time. By anticipating the time of payment the bankers obtain 2 5 per cent, interest per month on the money which the peasant is obliged to borrow ; they de press the market by the necessity which the peasant is under of realising at any price, they can bargain with the villages for the exclusion of all other competitors for their produce, and even for a further reduction below the price of the already depressed market. \" It is by this band of bankers, jobbers, and specu lators that Turkey secures the exact payment of her revenue, and surrounds the governors of her provinces with a financial thraldom and espionage, through which the boldest arms have never succeeded in breaking, while at the same time the pashas are driven to such an excess of extortion that enmity is placed between the province and its governor. To destroy the influence of the Arme-"], [349, "Letter VI. 313 THE SARRAFS. nians, which grinds the peasantry and puts hatred between ''\u2022e pasha and his province, it is only necessary to collect the revenue without the intervention of tho pasha ; and for which the municipal system, so prevalent in the Turkish empire, affords, without any new experiment, the ready- means.\" But it may be thought that so powerful aud united a body as the sarrafs would strenuously oppose any change. Mr. Urquhart, writing in 1833, proceeds to say, \" I can apprehend no such resistance ; the security that would accompany the change would increase the value of capital, open newT and vast fields of industry and enterprise ; capital would be eagerly withdrawn from its present pre carious investments ; and even if fortunes are not to be so rapidly realised, they are not so liable to sudden ruin, nor their possessors exposed to political intrigue and powerful vengeance. The sarrafs have no distinct influ ence nor political importance ; and their capital, and com mercial habits, would secure them better rewards in the honourable career of industry than they can reap in the successful hazards of gambling.\" We may now, therefore, form some notion of the nature and importance of the part which an Armenian sarraf fills in Turkey. Although that importance has been somewhat diminished of late by the suppression of the malikianehs,3 the sarrafs are still the intermediate agents between the treasury and the revenue contractors, and guarantees to the former for the payment at the appointed period of the 3 Vol. i. Letter xii. VOL. II. P"], [350, "Letter VI. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 314 money due, whether the taxes have been actually collected or not. In the latter case they advance the required amount at an interest of from 15 to 20 per cent. Con tracts of this nature, though generally fulfilled with remarkable exactness and fidelity on both sides, occasionally give rise to disputes. When this happens, the sarraf is permitted to bring his suit before the council of the mint. He would be wholly without redress before the ordinary tribunals, as the Musulman law declares all interest upon loans to be usurious, and therefore illegal ; but the council of the mint is empowered to recognise the legality of interest upon loans made by a banker to the government or government authorities. The sarrafs accredited by the Ottoman government, under the protection of fermans styled Gouiroglou, formed, until within the last fifteen years, a corporation, consisting of sixty or eighty members,4 the president of which was nominated by the Porte. Since 1842 the number has been reduced to fifteen, and the company itself divided into two bodies, one of which acts for the provinces of Roumelia, and one for those of Anatolia. The sarrafs are the usual money-lenders in Turkey ; they prefer to make advances upon personal property rather than upon land. The exorbitant rate of interest which they exact from the borrower often leads to the articles upon which the loan was obtained becoming the property of the lender. In addition to the foregoing employments, the sarrafs 4 Corresponding to the number of the pashaliks. See Urquhart, as above."], [351, "Letter VI. THE SARRAFS. 315 conduct the private affairs of the grandees, pashas, and great officers of state. They collect their debts, advance money when required, and manage the estates and for tunes of their patrons. In return they enjoy the most unlimited confidence, and are never asked for an account, nor even for an acknowledgment, of the money which s through their hands. Since the recent reforms, the Armenian sarrafs, in order to find employment for their capital, have invested it in the principal industrial enterprises of the empire ; thus the cloth manufactories, the powder-mills, the working of the mines, the lines of steamboat communication, are chiefly in their hands. But their most lucrative pri vilege is that of coining money, a privilege conceded a century ago to the family of Duz-Oghlou. This ex plains how the greater part of the specie of Turkey is at the present day in the hands of the Armenian sarrafs, and accounts for their influence over their countrymen. Untd 1842 they possessed the exclusive right of electing and deposing the patriarch, who consequently found him self absolutely dependent upon their favour, and they regulated, nominally in conjunction with him, the civil, and even the religious, affairs of the community : \u2014 at that period the Porte issued an ordinance which invited the esnafs to take part in the election of the patriarch, and established two councils, one for civil, the other for eccle - siastical affairs. Still, however, the ancient abuses main tained their ground; for the corporations (esnafs) thus called on to act politically, finding themselves little skilled in the practical part of public business, yielded insensibly to the influence of the sarrafs. This exclusive preponderance p2"], [352, "Letter VI LETTERS ON TURKEY. 316 of a caste has not, however, produced the evils that might be expected, owing to the national spirit which animates the Armenian race. The fourth class, that of the artisans, is divided into esnafs (corporations) according to the different trades ; the principal being those of the merchants, architects, gold smiths, watchmakers, locksmiths, painters, silk-weavers, tenners, &c. The merchants are of two classes, ordinary merchants, and bairatlis or chartered merchants, whose privileges consist in the exemption from certain imposts, and other immunities already mentioned.5 In architecture the Armenians have made considerable progress. The imperial palaces of Beylerbey and Tche ragan, the new palace of Dolma Baghtcheh (the elegant faqades of which adorn the shores of the Bosphorus), the great barracks of Selimia at Scutari, the mosque of Top kaneh which adjoins the arsenal, and many of the bazars aud public edifices in the city and suburbs are the work of Armenian architects. The corporation of goldsmiths includes all workers in gold and silver and jewellery. Engraving on precious stones, as well as the inlaying of metals (dornre en metaux), forms a separate trade, which none but Musulmans are permitted to exercise, at least at Constantinople. The watchmakers confine their labours to the repairing rather than to the construction of clocks and watches ; though occasionally they have had many skilful mecha nics amongst them, both in ancient and modern times.

The Broussa silks, of which such admirable specimens were seen at the London Exhibition in 1851, are chiefly manufactured by Armenians : the Armenians excel also in embroidery and the trade of tanning, which is princi pally carried on at Adapuyar. The manufacture of gunpowrder was introduced at Con stantinople, in the reign of Selim III., by an Armenian named Arakel Hadji Dael, who obtained the monopoly of it for himself and his heirs. One of the latter, Boghos Dadian, established a manufactory of cloth and silks at Nicomedia : the late Sultan converted this into a national establishment, and assigned over the profits to the de partment of the ministry of war. At the head of this establishment is an Armenian named Artin Saroukhanian. The rural population, especially in Turkish Armenia, retain the habits and manners of their forefathers, and are wholly employed in husbandry and in pasturing their cattle and flocks in the rich plains of Armenia. They are more advanced in agriculture than the Musulmans ; and if the government would only assist their efforts by the construction of roads, and establishing facilities for inter communication throughout the country, agriculture would progress, instead of retrograding as at the present day.

This view of the subject, though but device of a wily statesman, might perhaps be nearer realization than he imagined, but its immediate result was to produce an apparent inferiority of the Armenian Catholics to the other Christian subjects of the Porte. Dis- contents recommenced ; complaints were renewed ; the re- presentatives of the Roman Catholic courts at Constanti- nople resumed their interference ; the whole question was re-opened, and, before many months had elapsed, a new khatti-sherif was issued, substituting in place of the nazir an ecclesiastical chief, to be elected by the united-Armenian body, and to combine in his own person the two-fold au- thority possessed by the patriarchs of the other communi- ties, although he was to bear simply the title of bishop.

ARMENIAN CATHOLICS. 321 munities of Latin Christians in the East, was restricted to the body of the united-Armenians alone. These changes must be briefly explained. When the united-Armenian community, released from persecution in 1831, began to breathe a little and recover, it found itself surrounded by difficulties. Many of its members were scattered abroad, and reduced from wealth to beggary ; their habitations had either been sold, or consumed in the great fire at Pera in 1831 ; commerce had been destroyed, or had passed into other hands ; everything had to be restored ; hospitals, schools, and churches to be re-constructed, and the funds for the patriarchal administration provided. However formid able these difficulties, the united-Armenians, by prudence and readiness to make personal sacrifices for the general good, succeeded in overcoming them. Their first step was to convoke an assembly composed of representatives of the various classes of the community, by whom the national interests were debated with complete freedom of discussion. The result was the separation of the temporal and spiritual authorities, the former being con ferred on a patriarch elected by the community and con finned by the Porte : the latter on a primate appointed by the Pope. Pains were taken to prevent any encroach ment of these two authorities on each other, but in spite of this the clergy continually pretended to a larger share. in the management of affairs, whilst the people endea voured to restrict them to the exercise of their own peculiar functions. At length, to avoid the dangers and scandals of perpetual contests, a compromise was adopted. A deliberative voice in the council was conceded to the p3"], [358, "Letter VII. letters on turkey. 322 primate, and the patriarchal seal {nichan) was divided into three parts, which were respectively confided to the patri arch, tbe primate, and the president of the council. Lay judges were appointed to decide common disputes, the more important being reserved for arbitration ; and the reputation acquired by the united- Armenian tribunals became so great that the other ra'iahs, and even Musul mans themselves who had any difference with Catholics, often preferred their judgment. Local occupations did not, however, prevent the united- Armenian patriarchate fr jm extending its care to the interests of other Catholic communities remote from the capital, as the Melkhites, Syrians, Chaldeans, Aleppans, &c. No effort was spared to obtain a redress of their wrongs, and such was the prestige of the French nation \u2014 whose ambassador se conded the efforts of the patriarch\u2014 and the credit at that time enjoyed by the Armenian Catholics, that the Porte attended to their slightest complaints in less time than was formerly required to obtain an audierce of the grand vizir. Soon, however, those very Catholics, influenced by treacherous counsels, became impatient of an authority as yet only known by its benefits. The Aleppans. who at the time of the separation of the united-Armenians from the national church had themselves desired the inscrip- tion of all the Syrian Catholics in the bairat of the united- Armenian patriarch, began to show signs of discontent, and, deaf to the remonstrances of those who pointed out the evils and scandals of internal discord among the Christian rai'ahs, and the benefits of the Armenian Catholic protection, declared that, rather than endure it"], [359, "Letter VII. 323 ARMENIAN CATHOLICS. longer, they would place themselves under that of the Greek or the Armenian patriarch. They appealed both to Rome and Austria, and eventually, through the inter vention of Ahmed Fetlii Pasha, they were, by an imperial decree, replaced in the class of Latin raiahssi, with a Musulman functionary at their head ; and finally, their establishment as a separate body, having an official seal (nichan) of their own, was demanded and obtained by Austria ; that power having, since the pacification of Syria, pretended to a special protection over the Maronites and other Christians of Lebanon, and been constantly engaged in undermining French influence in those countries. These dissensions proved in the greatest degree in jurious to the credit of the Armenian Catholics, and soon caused them to decline from the highest to the lowest station among the ra'iah subjects of the Porte. Greeks, Jacobites, all the Christian churches opposed to the sway of Rome, soon recommenced intrigues against rivals whom they continued to regard with dislike and jealousy, but no longer with fear ; and the Catholics found them selves more than ever exposed to the open and secret attacks of their enemies. The Armenians of the national church, on the contrary, drew more closely their bonds of union, suppressed former divisions, and made every effort to emerge from a state of stagnation. They founded schools, printing-presses, hospitals, and a fund for the poor ; and having witnessed the amelioration realised in so short a time by the Catholics, in giving a national basis to their administration, they endeavoured to adopt a similar organisation. This period was marked by the"], [360, "Letter VII. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 324 promulgation, notwithstanding the active opposition 'of the clergy and a portion of the notables, of several im perial decrees, calling upon the esnafs to concur in the election of the Armenian patriarch, and entrusting the administration of the community to two distinct councils, one for civil, the other for ecclesiastical affairs. In the mean time, the Latinized Armenians, weakened by suc- cessive dismemberments, were reduced to a very small minority in the great Armenian family. The only way to preserve the position they had enjoyed since the reign of Selim III. would have been to unite together more closely, and to supply their want of numbers by perfect concord ; but the reverse of this took place. The civil 'isious produced by the rivalry of the Propagandist and Mechitarist factions broke out with increased fury, and plunged the community into such a state of anarchy that sagacious and impartial men have considered its disso lution as the only remedy for a situation which daily becomes worse. But, before proceeding further into the details of these dissensions, it may be desirable to glance at the actual position and geueral administration of the Armenian Roman-Catholics. II. Government and Administratios The united-Armenian community in the Turkish empire does not amount to more than from thirty-eight to forty thousand souls, thus distributed : about seventeen thousand at Constantinople, nine thousand at Angora, four thousand at Erzeroum, two thousand five hundred at"], [361, "r VI T. ARMENIAN CATHOLICS. 325 Trebizond, fifteen hundred at Artwin, and one thousand at Broussa. The civil and ecclesiastical authorities are entirely distinct ; the former is confided to a patriarch, chosen by the community and confirmed by the Porte, and enjoying the same rights and privileges as the patriarchs of the other communities. The patriarch receives a fixed stipend of five thousand piastres per month, exclusive of the salaries of the officers of his chancery. The community also provides for the expense of the bairat, amounting to sixty thousand aspers,5 paid to the Ottoman treasury under the name of present (pechkech), and also the yearly impost, fixed at three hundred and thirty-eight thousand aspers. The amount of these together may be about one hundred and fifty thousand piastres, which are furnished every year by a proportional tax levied by the national council. The national council is composed of twelve lay members, styled Bairatlis, because their election is confirmed by a bairat of the Porte : they are unpaid, and their functions limited to two years ; six retiring and six resuming office annually. The council, in conjunction with the patriarch, regulates everything concerning the civil and financial affairs of the community, and is arbitrator and judge in all dis putes which arise between Armenian Catholics themselves. In the provinces the bishops are assimilated to those of the other Christian communities, and combine in their own persons the civil and religious authorities. Each con stitutes, in conjunction with the primates, the civil tribunal 5 The asper is worth l-120th of a piastre."], [362, "Letter VII. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 326 of his diocese : aud it is also the joint duty of the bishop and primates to apportion the impost in the different localities. The Armenian Catholics of Constantinople, about thousand in number, form seven parishes : viz. Galata, Pera, Orta-ko'i, Buyukdereh, Kandili, and Scutari. They have a hospital for the poor, an infirmary for the insane annexed to the church of St. Jean Chrysos tom at Pera, a primary school in each parish, and two institutions for female education, one of which was founded by the family of Duz-Oghlou, who contribute ily to its support. This school, directed by a French lady, contains fifty boarders, six of whom are received without charge. The instruction is in French and Arme- nian, and conducted on the French system. The ecclesiastical hierarchy consists of, \u2014 1st. The patriarch of Cilicia ; 2nd. The primate of Constanti- \u25a0 ; 3rd. The bishops ; 4th. The monastic and the secular clergy. The jurisdiction of the patriarch of Cilicia,6 who re sides at Bezoummar, in the Lebanon, extends over Cilicia, Mesopotamia.

The primatial see is supported without any appeal to the funds of the community, all its expenses being provided for by the Propaganda of Rome and the \" (Envies des Missions.\" ' The mode of electing the primate is still unsettled. Before the year 1845 it was customary for the united- Armenian community to send to Rome the names of three candidates, of which one was to be selected by the Holy See ; but at the death of the last primate, Marusci, in 1845, Monsignore Hassoun was appointed without the national consent or even participation. An energetic remonstrance was immediately forwarded to Rome against this innova tion, accompanied by a demand for the restoration of the ancient usage ; but the papal court, under pretext of upholding the independence of the church, not only re sisted, but endeavoured to erect its violation of the law into a principle, The affair was then submitted to the national council, and a project laid down for the mode of electing the primate. The 25th article of this project, based on ancient regulations, required that the primate should be nominated from a list of three candidates chosen by the community, and, in case the Vatican should refuse to elect one of these, a protest should be made (Protestarono contra di Roma). Violent discussions followed this pro posal \u2014 opinions, on both sides maintained with equal 7 We find in the report of the missions for the year 1844 a sum of 26,500 francs allotted for the primate Marusci.\u2014 Annales de la Propagation de la Foi, vol. xviL"], [364, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter VII. 328 vehemence, appeared, when the votes were taken, to be equally divided, so that no decision could be arrived at, and the council was dissolved. Public attention, wholly engrossed with this affair, became withdrawn from every thing else ; daily business was neglected, the public debt soon increased to a million of piastres, and at length the patriarch, intervening as civil chief of the community, ob tained an order from the Porte for a new convocation of the council for the despatch of other business, the contested article being reserved as a pending question, and some progress was made in relieving the finances. In the following year the quarrel, which at different times had occasioned the intervention of Rome, France, and the Porte, was renewed on a question of the appointment of bishops. The primate of Cilicia, being at Rome, 1851, took upon himself, without consulting the authorities in his own country, or even acquainting them with his inten tions, to obtain from Pius IX. a pastoral letter erect ing the cities of Broussa, Angora, Trebizond, Erzeroum, and Artwin into bishoprics, and appointing five prelates chosen by himself and the See of Rome to fill them. The united-Armenian community resented, not unnaturally, this ecclesiastical encroachment, and, though consenting to recognise the institution of the five new bishoprics \u2014 notwithstanding the necessity for them was not very ap parent \u2014 refused to confirm the nomination of the indivi duals selected to be the new bishops, on the ground of the irregularity of their appointment ; while the Porte, which had kept aloof from the dispute concerning the election of the primate, now intervened, as its own prerogatives were virtually attacked. It must be remembered that provincial"], [365, "Letter VII. ARMENIAN CATHOLICS. 329 bishops of the united-Armenian Church enjoy a civil power not possessed by their primate at Constantinople, and that the pretension of the papal see would have enabled it to create an authority over a certain portion of the Sultan's subjects wholly foreign to and uncontrolled by tbe Porte itself. No matter how small that portion, the principle remained the same, and all the arguments adduced by Rome, founded upon the alleged necessity for maintaining the unity of doctrine and discipline, and strenuously supported by the propagandists, fell to the ground before this axiom of political law : \" that a sovereign cannot tolerate a foreign civil authority within his own domi nions.\" It was in fact a claim, similar in principle though different in form and proportions, to that which, recently insisted on by Prince Menschikoff, has given rise to the grave situation in which Europe is now placed. The nomination of the bishops was eventually recognised by the community, but with a reservation of the national rights on the occurrence of the next vacancy. The clergy are divided into two orders, the secular and the monastic or regular. The first comprehends the priests of the Propaganda of Rome, who in general occupy the higher dignities of the church, and the ordinary priests, who have received their education at the seminaries of Angora, Trebizond, or the primatial see at Con stantinople. Although marriage is permitted to the priests of the united-Armenian Church, and of other Eastern churches recognised by the Holy See, but few avail themselves of the permission, and these are in general confined to the dioceses of Erzeroum and Artwin. The number is diifo-"], [366, "Letter VII. 330 LETTERS ON TURKEY. nishing daily, in consequence of the efforts daily made by Rome to Latinize the doctrines of the Eastern commu nities, and to bring them all into more perfect subjection to herself. The united-Armenian priests, like those of the non united church, are subdivided into Vartabieds or doctors, and ordinary priests or Derders. This distinction, how ever, is less marked than among the non-united Arme nians; and the title of \" Vartabied\" is often erroneously applied to ecclesiastics in general, whether they have attained the degree of doctor or not The Vartabieds carry a crosier like the Romish bishopa The regular or monastic clergy is composed of the Mechitarist monks of Venice and of Vienna, who have a college at Constan tinople, and of the Autonine monks of Mount Lebanon. The rule followed by the Antonfoe brotherhood is the same which was formerly observed in all the Armenian monasteries, and which Mechitar himself originally gave to his disciples, though he subsequently substituted that of St. Benedict. These Antonines are about ninety in number, and occupy three convents on Mount Lebanon ; some of them are likewise attached to churches at Con stantinople and other parts of the empire. M. Guys, in his description of Mount Lebanon, says that \" they are well-informed, polite, and correct in morals ; and what ever accusations the other fraternities of the mountain may have brought on themselves, the catholic- Armenian monks, confining themselves to the observance of their monastic rule and the occupations of their ministry, have been admirable guides and examples to the people.'' The united-Armenian priests receive no regular stipends,"], [367, "Letter VII. ARMENIAN CATHOLICS. 331 but, like those of Ireland, derive their support from the church fees and the remuneration they receive from their flocks for the performance of their sacred functions. In the houses ofthe principal sarrafs a domestic chaplain is generally attached to the establishment, who resides in the famdy, where, under au unpretending exterior, he often exercises considerable influence ; the post is gene rally held by a Mechitarist of Venice or Vienna. Such priests as have no means of providing for themselves are supported by the community ; but the generality of them are in tolerably easy circumstances, the Antonine monks being the most indigent. We must not quit the subject without a brief notice of the schism between the Mechitarists and the disciples of the Propaganda, the consequences of which threaten to be so fatal to the united-Armenian church and community. This rivalry of old date, and long dormant, was awakened to fresh vigour in the year 1846, by a question of the establishment of a society, the object of which was to reconcile the two divisions of the nation, in order that they might labour conjointly to effect the intellectual, and perhaps ultimately the political, emancipation of Armenia This idea, originally suggested by Father Minassion, a Mechitarist monk, was ardently adopted by the young and more intelligent portion of the Armenio-Catholic com munity, those especially who had studied at European universities and acquired more liberal and tolerant prin ciples than their countrymen by contact with the Western 'nations. But when the founders of the society submitted their statutes to the primate, Mgr. Hassoun, that prelate refused his approbation, and his refusal was confirmed by"], [368, "Letter VII. LETTERS OX TURKEY. 332 a decree of tbe Propaganda, dated 28th of May, 1850.8 Notwithstanding his opposition the society was eventually constituted, and, being secretly favoured by the Mechi tarists, they were attacked by the disciples of the Propa ganda, with a violence augmented by the antagonism of the two parties in the former question of the bishoprics. In that question, as well as in that of the election of the primate, the Mechitarists upheld the liberties and pre rogatives of the Armenian Church, which tbe Romish party, in their zeal for what, in the Western world, is called ultramontanism, were ready to sacrifice. In point of fact, however, the origin of the dispute dates still farther back. It took its rise in the question as to whether the non-united Armenians should be considered sretics or not? and whether it was lawful to enter their churches or partake of the Holy Communion with them ? The disciples of the Propaganda, the Mechitarists of Vienna, and the Antonines of Lebanon, declare the non united Armenians heretics and schismatics, and refuse communion with them ; whilst the 3fechitarists of Venice, influenced probably by the hope, which they never aban don, of an ultimate reunion of the two fractions of the nation, take the opposite view. * \" The Holy Congregation, after having maturely considered the na ture of this co-national society, especially with regard to its regulations aud the spirit which is daily developing itself, no, withstanding certain pretended modifications, has thought fit to agree in the sentiments already manifested (_by Mgr. Hassoun), and to disapprove of this society, par ticulars t of the dangers which might accrue therefrom to the spiritual welfare of Armenian Catholics. Its objects are of a character so vague and indeterminate, that incautious persons might easily, and without being aware of it, be led to tbe commission of actions which ice would condemn.\""], [369, "Letter VII. 333 ARMENIAN CATHOLICS. The history of this dispute is sufficient to demonstrate the spirit and tendencies of the adverse parties. On the one hand we recognise the absolutism, love of dominion, and desire of encroachment, characteristic of the Church of Rome : ever seeking to realise the ideal of universal supremacy which formerly constituted her strength, and which has survived the decay of her power, she leaves no means unemployed to infuse her own spirit into the other churches, whose spiritual allegiance she demands ; and she is well seconded by the Armenian disciples of the Propaganda, who, notwithstanding their nationality, being educated at Rome, are imbued with Romish ideas ; and having exchanged their national and instinctive attach ment to their country for devotion to their adopted church, have become, before and above all things, not only priests, but Romish priests. With the Mechitarist monks of St. Lazarus, on the other hand, patriotism remains the supreme influence to which every other, even that of the church itself, is secondary. From the isles of the Lagunes or the shores of the Bosphorus, their eyes are equally directed towards Mount Ararat, to which they fondly look as the home of their faith and their affections \u2014 -the central point of their political and religious existence, when time shall bring about the resurrection of Armenian nationality : and if they must acknowledge their brethren of the na tional church to be in error, to be even heretics, still are they not all brethren in language, customs, and descent ; children of the ancient Ha'iasdan ; companions in exile and servitude ? and shall they not endeavour to lessen the breach that now keeps them apart, and seek to unite in the great work of national restoration? Such are the"], [370, "Letter VII. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 334 considerations which impel the more liberal and less Latinized section of the Armenio-catholics to toleration towards their countrymen. It must, however, be confessed, that with all this appa rent liberality and tolerance, the Mechitarist party are far from being free from a sectarian spirit, and would rather act in contradiction to their own principles than second any measure which originated with their opponents. Thus, human motives, personal animosities, and the thirst for rule, influence both parties ; whilst mutual envy and jealousy are fostered by the riches and credit of the Mechitarists on one side, and by the high ecclesiastical positions occupied by their adversaries on the other. The hostility of the two parties, being once established, is manifested on all occasions, but chiefly in their respec- tive modes of education : in their schools at Constantinople, and in their colleges at Venice and Paris, the Mechitarist fathers of St. Lazarus mingle with religious and literary instruction the records of Armenian glory, the renown of ancestry, and the love of country ; the language used, and the authors read and commented on, are Armenian ; whilst their opponents treat with irony and sarcastic disdain tbe native authors enumerated by Father Sukias de Somal, and, rejecting the native language and literature of Armenia, permit their pupils to use only those of Rome, Italian and Latin ; whilst they are inexhaustible in their satire of the ' Grammatiche ed Academic Haicane,' of which the Mechi- tarists are so proud, and the ' Purissimo Linguaggio Ha'i cano,' which to them appears so harmonious. In short, to use their own words, they would \" let nationality perish rather than doctrine ! \" \" The holy pulpit was never esta-"], [371, "L ar VII. ARMENIAN CATHOLICS. 335 blished to teach patriotism, but the love of Gospel truth.\" 9 In the same spirit they treat the saints of the national church with contempt ; and for Mesrob, Narses, and St- Gregory the Enlightener, they substitute St. Francis d'As sise, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Dominic, &c. From the church and the schools the schism has invaded the administration and weakened its efficiency ; thence it has passed into the nation at large, which it has divided into two camps, the animosity ofthe parties being increased by the presence of Armenian or Propagandist priests in the bosoms of families. Though a few persons of reflection may escape this fanaticism of sectarian hostility, it possesses the majority of the nation, and causes all other interests to be neglected, the most sacred duties to be forgotten, and the closest connexions to be dissolved. Not only is all intercourse broken off between families who entertain chaplains of different creeds, but, discord has found its way into the family itself, setting husband against wife, son against father, brother against brother, and be coming a fruitful source of divorces, lawsuits, and scandals.1 Such a state of things is, however, too violent to last : and, as all expedients of conciliation have been tried, in vain, it is probable that before long there will be a spontaneous dissolution of the Armenio-Cafholic com- 9 See II Mekhitarista di San Lazaro, p. 123.

As to the political consequences of such an event, the Armenio-Catholic community is not sufficiently numerous or important to affect in any way the destinies of Turkey. The question regards only the possibility of a national restoration, and the probabilities in favour of this must be drawn from the character of the Armenian nation in general. IIL Of the Moral and Political State of Turkish Armenia. M. Lamartine has given us a striking portrait of the Armenians. \" These Armenians,\" says he, \" are a superb race of men ; their costume, which is plain and noble, displays to advantage2 their athletic forms ; their physiognomy is intelligent : they have florid complexions, blue eyes, and beards of a lightish colour. They are the Swiss of the East Industrious, peaceable, and regular in their habits, they resemble them also in calcula- tion aud love of gain. Offering their commercial skill for hire to the Turks, they have nothing heroic or bel- ligerent in their nature ; commerce is their deity, and they would engage in it under any master. They, of all the Christian races, have the most affinity with the Turks. The women are lovely, their features are pure and deli cate, and their serene expression recalls the beauty of the \u2022 Latterly the Armenians, like the other subjects of the Porte, have replaced the turban by the Fez, or red woollen skull-cap, universally worn in the Levant."], [373, "Letter VII. 337 ARMENIAN CATHOLICS, women of the British Islands or of the peasants of Switzerland.\" 3 Such in fact is the general appearance of the Armenians of Constantinople and the trading ports of the Levant ; but the noble exterior conceals a narrow spirit and a pusillanimous character. Beyond the limits of cities, and nearer his native soil, in the environs of Tauris or Erze roum, tbe Armenian is no longer the same being ; pride of expression and energy of sentiment combine to set off the beauty of his external form, and in the midst of his rude labours he has preserved the independent spirit and the warlike disposition of his ancestors.4 He has only beheld oppression from afar ; for even when war was raging around him he continued to cultivate his field, whilst his wife and daughters pursued unmolested their usual avoca tions ; and his churches have been respected, though left open night and day. He has been found more than once fighting in the Persian ranks before the Russians passed the Caucasus, and even serving in the East India Com pany's army ; and Armenian merchants, disdaining the inactive life of the countinghouse and the desk, often lead their caravans in person to Japan or China. The same contrast that we have already noticed between the dege nerate Greek of Constantinople on the Asiatic shore, and the Palicar of Epirus or Macedonia, passing his life in the free air, with his gun on his shoulder, exists between the Armenian of the city and him who dwells in the ancient plains of his forefathers. They are distinguished by a remarkable attachment for traditional customs and man- 3 Lamartine, Voyage en Orient, vol. ii. p. 190. * See Fonton, La Eussie dans t'Asie Mineure. Paris, 1840. VOL. II.

The wife, during the first years of her marriage, presumes not to raise her eyes or to speak in presence of her husband, nor the daughter to seat herself in pre sence of her father ; the head of the family is understood at the slightest sign, and as instantly obeyed ; and the whole system of social life seems to recall the age of the patriarchs. Transplanted into cities, the Armenian 5 speedily dege nerates. The change from the agricultural to the com mercial life, the leve of lucre, the contact of the Turks, and, at a later period, the imitation of European manners, have contributed to destroy all manly instincts. The energy of the race has disappeared or diminished along with their national customs.6 The national religion only, and certain qualities which mark the commercial tendencies of the race, as order, economy, diligence, and fair dealing, have remained unchanged, and have not a little contri buted, in our own time, to revive the power and credit of the Armenians. The parsimony with which they are often repro docs not exclude a love of ostentation. Econom \u25a0 home, they are fond of shining in tbe eyes of strangers ; and ever since the abolition ofthe ancient sumptuary- laws \u2014 which interdicted them, in common with other ra'iahs, from the use of certain stuffs, and obliged them to paint the front of their houses black \u2014 the greatest display of luxury in Turkey, both in dress and house-ornament, has been made by Armenians. They have the finest 6 Jaubert, Voyage en Armenie et en Perse. 6 See a description of an Armenian marriage in the ' Coup^i'ceil sur I' Armenie,' by M.

This taste is more particularly observable amongst the Armenian Catholics, whose manners partake more of European civilisation, and who exhibit also a greater apti tude for the arts and liberal professions. If they cannot boast of so many profound scholars as the non-united Armenians, they have more artists and men of literature and science, especially medical practitioners, many of whom are professors in the school of Galata-Sera'i. They send their children to be educated in France, Italy, Germany, &c, give them French preceptors, and affect a famihar use among each other of European languages, which the other Armenians are only beginning to study. Their women have long since discontinued the use of the yashmak,\"' and the feredge,8 and have adopted French fashions. But all this civilisation is merely external, and if in domestic arrangements as in manners and lan guage the surface is European, the foundation remains Armenian. If I were asked whether this aspiration towards the knowledge and customs of the West, admitting that it may gradually produce a moral regeneration, is to be considered also as a forerunner of their political emanci pation, I should reply in the negative. Some Armenians indeed more enlightened than the rest, and somewhat influenced by the hope which, in the masses as with 7 A veil used by the Turkish, Armenian, and Jewish women, cover ing the head and neck, and leaving open only the upper part of the nose and eyes. 8 A large cloak, also used by Armenian and Turkish women.

Where are the elements of it to be found ? How will it be possible to reunite the disjointed members of the family of Ha'isdan, scattered over three quarters of the globe? What is their rallying-point ? If the indepen dence of Armenia was little more than a chimera even in the time of its princes, how can it be made a reality after six centuries of servitude ? From 1813 to 1829 the Armenians appeared to think their emancipation at hand. Russia stood in need of them to make a diversion against the Ottoman forces, and held out to them the hope of becoming an inde pendent principality, under the protection of the Czar. Her promises were believed, and, in their devotion to their destined liberator, they w ithstood for more than six weeks an army of 80,000 Persians, who were marching against Russia, and prevented them from crossing their frontier ; but these services reaped a poor reward, for not only were the Russians faithless to their promises, but they seized the opportunity of some trifling disturbance in the country to lay violent hands on the venerable arch bishop Narses, who was dragged in the first place to St. Petersburg, and afterwards banished to Bessarabia, whilst several of the principal Armenian chiefs were scattered in exile through foreign countries, or carried off to Russia to be heard of no more. From this time, the Armenians of Turkey, who for merly used to emigrate to Russia in bodies of from twelve to fifteen thousand at a time, have been gradually drawing nearer to the Osmanlis, with whom they have a much"], [377, "Letter VII. 341 ARMENIAN CATHOLICS. greater affinity ; for, of all the nations subject to the Porte, the Armenians have most in common with the Ottomans, and arc the most directly concerned in the maintenance of their empire. Much of the commerce and industry of the country is in the hands of Armenians ; since the reforms in Turkey their condition has become greatly improved ; their wealth is no longer in danger of spoliation, and it may therefore be easily imagined that they are the last to desire a change. The truth is, that at the present time the Armenians dread no less than the Turks them selves the appearance of a Russian army under the walls of Constantinople : though, in the event of those northern invaders actually laying siege to the capital, it may be questioned whether the Armenians of the capital would take up arms in its defence, for they are more attached to life than even to fortune, and have a greater dread of battle than of servitude.9 9 For a very interesting account of the Armenian nation the reader is referred to Baron von Haxthausen's ' Transcaucasia,' of which an admir able translation has recently appeared. \u2014 T."], [378, "LETTERS ON TURKEY.

The charm of this purely oriental city, its cool streams, its multitudinous palaces and gardens, and the rich luxuriance of the sur rounding country, reminding the fugitives of their beloved Granada, induced them to arrest their steps, and they were received by the Sultan with the benevolence which the Koran enjoins towards all those who voluntarily seek the protection of the Amaun. Towards the end of the same century 1. 1492), under the influence of the cruel Torquemada, a new persecution arose against the Jews of Spain, more sweeping and relentless than the former : eight hundred thousand of them were expelled the country, being allowed to carry away or sell their moveable pro perty only. The unhappy fugitives separated into two bands, the smaller of which, after being driven from country to country, came at last to Rome, where the pope Alexander VI. permitted them to remain ; the others directed their steps at once towards the dominions of the Sultan, where some of their countrymen had previously found an 1 See his ' Relation de ses Voyages,' in Hebrew, printed at Constau tinople in 1543; translated into Latin at Ley den in 1643, by Arias Montanus, and into French at Amsterdam in 1734, under the title of ' Voyage du cctebre Benjamin autour du Monde, commence\" l'an 1173.'"], [380, "LETTERS ON TURKEY.

The sultan Bajazet II. even went beyond his predecessors in affording a ready protection to his new guests. The blanks which the conquest had left in the population of Constantinople had never been filled up, notwithstanding all the efforts of the conqueror ; Bajazet therefore encouraged them to become permanent subjects of the Porte by granting them liberty of self government in their civd and religious concerns, and placing them on the same footing in all respects as the ra'iahs of the empire.

Remains of the race are still to be found in Circassia, inhabiting the northern slopes ofthe Caucasus. They consist of about 12,000 families, under an inde pendent chief, who bears the ancient name of Khagan, or Chagan, and maintain themselves principally by pillage and the chace. The title of Khagan, or Chagan, is preserved by the Jewish rabbins at Constantinople to the present day. See Gibbon, chap, xiii., xiv., xlvi.; 'History of Charlemagne,' by G. P. R. James; Bouillet, ' Diet. Univer selle.'\u2014T. * Within the circuit of the city walls there are no Jews. They are separated from it by a stream of water and an arm of the sea of St. Sophia, and can only reach the city by boats, and only for affairs of commerce. About a thousand of them meet together under their mas ters, the disciples of Wisdom; among whom are found the great Attalion, Abdias, Aaron Caspus, Joseph Scharginus, and Eliakim, the fovernor-in-chief. Some are workers in silk and makers of robes, and the greater part are rich merchants. No Jew is allowed to ride on horseback, except Solomon of Egypt, the king's physician, who renders the Jews great services and consolation in their captivity. The Greeks hate them with an indiscriminate aversion, especially the tanners, who discharge before the doors of the Jews the dirty water that has been used in their trade, and incite the people to pursue and ill treat them in the streets.

This uniformity of career, this tranquillity under Ottoman rule, so opposite to the agitations and convulsions of other ra'iahs, especially of the Greeks, whose very existence has been often in peril, is explained partly by the peaceable habits and disposition of the Jews, which cause no umbrage to the Porte, and partly by the tolerant character \u2014 so long mis understood \u2014 of the Turkish Government. Patient, indus trious, and resigned to their fate, they wore without apparent sense of humiliation the coloured beneesh 6 (jehou daiii), which the ancient sumptuary laws of the empire enjoined as a mark to distinguish them from the Musul man, and took as much pains to withdraw from notice as the Greeks to put themselves forward. United by an indissoluble bond of common faith and common interest, which gathers strength from their isolation and the con tempt with which they are regarded, the Jews, whilst they appear to be occupied only with their commerce and indifferent to all beyond, secretly cherish the hope of one day regaining possession of Jerusalem, and therefore with patient assiduity continue the uninterrupted series of their annals up to the day marked as the end of the great 5 It is said that there are more than 40,000 Jews at Constantinople: many are good linguists, rich merchants, and skilful workmen. \u2014 Turco- Gr\u00e6cia, p. 485. 6 A cloak with open sleeves."], [383, "Letter VIII. 347 THE ISRAELITES. captivity. This indeed is the central point of their union ; this is rather their faith than their hope ; and for this reason Jews are seldom found engaged in the culti vation of the soil, which for them is always the \" land of the stranger, and the house of bondage.\" Here they have been born \u2014 here perhaps they may die : but still they may be called upon to depart at a moment's warning, and, holding themselves, therefore, in readiness for the long expected signal, they await its arrival with that patient and submissive faith from which oppressed races derive their strength and consolation. Once only the Jews at Constantinople have been on the eve of rebellion, led away by the belief that the hour of their deliverance had arrived. This happened in 1666, under the vizirship of Koupruli-Ahmed Pasha. Ac cording to popular tradition, the year 1666 was destined to be signalized by some wonderful event. The Musulman was expecting the Dedjal and the Medhi, and the Jews were looking with extraordinary earnestness for the Mes siah. \" At this moment,\" says M. Jouanin, who borrows his account from the pages of the learned historian of the Ottoman empire, \" a Jew of Smyrna, named Sabatha'i Levi (or Sevi), profiting by the general belief, announced himself as the expected Messiah. This impostor, son of an agent of the English factory7 at Smyrna, was possessed of eloquence and an advantageous exterior ; he affected great modesty, expressed himself in oracular language, and went about everywhere proclaiming that ' the times were accom plished! At length, establishing himself at Jerusalem, 7 According to others he was the son of a poulterer of Aleppo. \u2014 See Histoire Universelle, v.

The disciples of the new Messiah had given out that he was endowed with miraculous powers, and his rapidly-spreading reputation began to cause so much excitement, that the governor of Smyrna would have seized and imprisoned him, had he not withdrawn with a number of his followers, and departed for Constantinople. On his arrival in that city, the grand vizir Koupruli, little respecting his pretended mission, caused him to be arrested and thrown into prison, whither the Jews, re- garding persecution as the seal of prophecy, thronged in crowds, soliciting permission to kiss his feet\u2014 a privilege readily granted to those who were willing to pay for it. The countrymen of Sabatha'i, stimulated by his predic- tions, began to excite commotions in Constantinople ; he was therefore removed to the castle of the Darda- nelles, and from thence to the Seraglio of Adrianople, for the fame of his reputed miracles was so great that tlie Sultan Mohammed IV. was desirous of interrogating in person this self-styled \" King of Israel.\" On appearing before the Grand Signior, he replied in bad Turkish to the questions that were addressed to him. \" You speak very ill,\" said the Sultan, \" for a Messiah, who ought to possess the gift of tongues ; but perhaps you can work miracles ? \" \" Sometimes,\" was the modest reply of"], [385, "349 Letter VIII. THE ISRAELITES. Sabathai. The Sultan, desirous therefore to try his miraculous powers, commanded that he should be stripped and set up as a mark for the arrows of the Itchoglans, to which his miraculous endowments would probably render him invulnerable. On hearing this order, the wretched impostor fell on his knees, exclaiming that such a miracle exceeded his powers. They then offered him the alternative of embracing Islamism, or being impaled ; he chose the former without hesitation, became Maho metan, and even carried his humiliation so far as to accept the post of doorkeeper of the Seraglio in exchange for his visionary kingdom of Israel ; and to extenuate in some measure the disgrace of so ridiculous a finish to his lofty pretensions, he pretended that his mission related merely to the substitution of the Mahometan for the Jewish faith, according to the predictions of ancient pro phecies. Thus a great number of Jews were brought over to Islamism ; but the degraded Sabathai, after serving for ten years as an instrument of these conversions, was exiled to the Morea, where some time afterwards he died.8 This was the only crisis that the Jews have had to endure ; for the storms which have burst at intervals over other ra'iahs, and even threatened to overwhelm them, have passed harmlessly over the Israelites. Not only have they always stood aloof from the hopes and struggles of the Greeks and the other Christian communities, but have s The populace, however, were so persuaded of the divine mission of Sabathai, that for a long time they refused to believe in hiB death, a cir cumstance which encouraged the appearance of another impostor, called Daniel Israel, a few years after.

This hatred has been often frightfully evinced by the eagerness with which the Jewish rabble have been seen to follow the Turkish executioner, in order to gratify their personal hatred by inflicting additional cruelties on the victims of the law.9 The treat ment which the corpse of the unfortunate patriarch Gregory \u2014 executed on suspicion of being implicated in the Greek insurrection \u2014 received from the Jews in 1821, was an instance of this ; l whilst at Salonica, in that and the following year, the Jews were seen casting aside their national habits and instincts, and enlisted under the Turk ish flag, fighting with insatiable fury against the Greeks.2 These circumstances, especially the outrage to the body of the patriarch, have aggravated the reciprocal hatred entertained by the Greeks, who never miss an opportunity of satisfying their rancour against the Jews, by depicting them umler the most odious colours to the Porte and the foreign legations, and endeavouring to bring on them persecution of every kind. The mysterious assassination of Father Thomas at Damascus, in 1840, afforded the Greeks one of these opportunities, which they eagerly seized. The recollection of this catastrophe is probably stdl fresh in the public mind. On the 5th of February, 1840, Father Thomas, the superior of a convent of Spanish monks at Damascus, and his servant Ibrahim-Amarah, disappeared 0 When such victims happened to be Greeks. 1 Letter I. page 1U3. 5 See Raffenel, Histoire des Eve'nemens de la Grece, t. i. p. 205, and t. ii. p. 238."], [387, "Letter VIII. THE ISRAELITES. 351 in the quarter of the Jews, and no trace of either could be discovered until, after the lapse of some days, the body of the priest, frightfully mutilated, was found in a sewer of the city. Public rumour pointed out seven Jews, the richest and most respected among the Hebrew population, as the authors of this murder, to which many horrible details were of course added, the principal being that the murderers, after having cut the throat of the victim, had received the blood in a basin, to be used in the celebration of their Passover ! This event, the investigations to wdiich it gave rise, the arrest and torture of the seven accused persons, and the general persecution that ensued of the Israelites at Damascus, caused a profound sensation in Europe. M. Cremieux, the distinguished French lawyer, published an eloquent plea in behalf of the Damascene Jews in the ' Gazette des Tribunaux,' 7th April, 1840 ; whilst in the following June M. Fould brought the affair before the Chamber of Deputies at Paris ; his example being followed, at a very short interval, by Sir Robert Peel in the English House of Commons. In London, .at Paris, and at Vienna, committees were formed to inquire into the affair, and to pursue in a uniform and simultaneous manner the investigation of the truth concerning it ; whilst the Jewish consistories of London and Paris each deputed one of their chief members, Messrs. Montefiore and Cremieux, to proceed to Damascus for the same object. Syria was at that moment under the government of Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of Egypt ; and when the delegates, accompanied by Dr. Munck, arrived at Alexandria (4th August), they found that Austria had already inter-"], [388, "Letter VIII. 352 LETTERS ON TURKEY fered, and, at her demand, the Viceroy had laid the matter before a commission composed of the consuls of England, Russia, Austria, and Prussia On the 1st of September a ferman was issued, ordaining that the Jews who had been accused and imprisoned at Damascus should be set at liberty ; and the private secretary of the Viceroy, in transmitting a copy of this ferman to Messrs. Montefiore and Cremieux, added, \" Political circum stances do not permit us to subject the conduct of the local authorities in this deplorable affair to severe investi gation : we entreat you therefore, gentlemen, to accept for the present this ferman, which has been granted not as a matter of favour, but of justice.\" Thus concluded this tragic drama, which still remains involved in mystery. The courageous interference of some of their European brethren did indeed put a stop to the persecution kindled against the Jews of Damascus, but could not obtain a revision of the accusation and trial, which alone would have silenced the reproaches that are continually brought against the Jews when any circum stance happens to recall the memory of this unhappy event. The sensation produced by this tragedy had not wholly subsided when the disappearance of a young Greek child, in the island of Rhodes, furnished a new opportunity of attacking the Jews. Some Jews, as it is reported, being in quest of eggs, at the entrance of a village not far from the city they found a Greek woman who offered to sell them the quantity they required. After agreeing about the price, they begged her to allow her son (a child about eight or nine years old) to carry the eggs to a house in the Jewish quarter"], [389, "Letter VIII. THE ISRAELITES. 353 which they indicated. The woman consented, and the little boy departed with the Jews, never to return. On the following day the mother, terrified at her child's con tinued absence, addressed a complaint to the governor. The event soon became known, and roused the whole Greek population of the island against the Jews, who were accused, as usual, of having killed the child, in order to use its blood at the celebration of their Passover. Strange to say. the consuls of England, Austria, and Sweden, took part with the popular excitement against the Jews, urging the Pasha to act with rigour towards them. The latter having appealed to Constantinople, the council of justice took cognizance of the affair, and commanded the ac cused parties to appear before them ; they went, accom panied by a deputation of their brethren to watch the trial. It was about a year after the promulgation of the khatti-sherif of Gul-khane : Reshid Pasha, then minister of foreign affairs, was anxious to establish his reputation for liberality and tolerance ; Lord Ponsonby, the English ambassador, also interfered personally in defence of the accused, disavowed the conduct of the consul at Rhodes, and on the 20th of July the council came to a decision, \" that the Jews should be acquitted, after a full and minute investigation of the charge made against them by the Greeks, of having carried off a young Greek boy with the intention of putting him to death, and using his blood in the Paschal ceremonies.\" The Pasha of Rhodes was deprived of his post, and the Israelite deputation, allowed to bring an action for damages against the English, Austrian, and Swedish consuls, ob tained an indemnity of one hundred and fifty thousand"], [390, "Letter VIII. 354 LETTERS ON TUBKEY. piastres, for the expenses of their journey and residence at the capital Nor did the measures of the Porte stop here. In order to extinguish at once the odious prejudice, which represents the Jews as obliged by the precepts of their law to use human blood at the celebration ofthe Passover, it was determined that their religious books should be examined by a commis sion of learned men, well versed in Hebrew theology. The result of this examination demonstrated in the clearest manner that the Jews were expressly forbidden to use in their sacrifices, not only human blood, but even that of the inferior animals,3 and the Porte promulgated an official 3 The origin of this popular prejudice, which has served as a pretext for so many atrocities, is thus related in a work entitled ' Religion et Judaism,' by M. Hurvitz, of Berlin, t. ii. p. (37: \u2014 \" According to a tradition of the Talmud, carefully preserved by the Israelites, it happened that, during their bondage in Egypt, a king of that country, being afflicted with leprosy, caused several little Jewish boys to be put to death, for the purpose of bathing himself in then blood; for it was a general belief at that time that this disease might be cured by a bath of fresh warm blood; and this remedy was often resorted to by persons of high rank in Egypt, who, when attacked with leprosy, used to procure children, by purchase or stealth, for the sake of their blood. If such was their practice towards Egyptian children of the lowest caste, it is reasonable to suppose that those of the en slaved nation would not be treated with greater compassion. Now, as the Passover of the Jews is intended to celebrate their departure and deliverance from the land of Egypt, there is something very natural and appropriate in commemorating in this festival, both by words and symbols, all the wounds and sufferings of their former captivity, so as to evince a more lively gratitude to God. For this reason the Talmudists command that wine of a very red colour should be used on the eve of the Passover, to bring to mind the cruelty of their tyrants.\" Hence arises the absurd belief, prevalent in the middle ages, that the Jews drink blood on tbe evening of Easter-day; with the addition, that they use Christian blood in preference to that of their brethren.

With this short historical preamble, we shall proceed to give some details relative to the present state of the Jews in Turkey. II. Statistics of Religious Sects. The number of Jews in the Ottoman empire (not in cluding the tributary provinces of the Danube) does not exceed one hundred and fifty thousand, about one fourth of whom reside at Constantinople, and less than half in European Turkey. The cities which (after the capital) contain the most are, Salonica (twelve thousand), Smyrna (five thousand), Broussa (three thousand), Jerusalem (eight thousand). The Israelites of Turkey are, generally speaking, attached to the doctrines of the Talmud, and to the teaching of their masters or rabbins, whence they are sometimes called Talmudists or Rabbinists. It is well known that the Talmud is held to be the sequel and development of the Bible, and that it has become the civil and religious code of the modern Jews. It is composed of the Mishna (or second law), which contains the text ; and of the Ghemara or commentary. \" Ghemara,\" in Hebrew, signifies \" accomplishment\" or out a shudder, as showing to what aberrations the human reason may be carried by religious animosity."], [392, "Letter VIII. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 356 \"perfection ;\" and the Oriental Jews regard the Talmud4 as an emanation from the Divinity. They maintain that the Pentateuch was transmitted to them orally by Moses, but the Talmud by writing. It is their absolute, un changeable, and unique law ; nothing in it having under gone the slightest modification, either as to the celebration of the Jewish festivals, or the observance of the most minute ceremonies of their worship. Nevertheless, the Jews have been unable to escape the Manich\u00e6an super stitions which so early penetrated into all Eastern creeds. They admit the power of demons and angels, of whom they regard Jehovah and Satan as the chiefs ; they believe that man is constantly accompanied by two of these, the good on his right, the bad on his left ; and that the air is filled with malevolent spirits, whom they call Schedim. But this name is never pronounced by them without awe ; and in alluding to these spirits they generally use the expression \" those im'tlwut.\" On the day that precedes the ceremony of circumcision the child is never out of sight of its parents, lest it should be stifled by Asche mida'i, the king of the Schedim.0 There are also among the Israelites of Turkey a few of a sect called Karaites (Readers, or followers of Scripture) ; because, rejecting the Talmud and the Rab binical interpretations, they adhere exclusively to the letter of the Bible. They may be considered as the 4 There are two Talmuds: that of Jerusalem, which was completed in the eleventh century ; and that of Babylon, which was composed at a later period. The latter is the only one followed. It occupies twelve volumes in folio. 5 Archives Israelites, an. 1840. Extract from the ' Magasin du Lit te'rature Etrangere.'"], [393, "Letter VIII. 357 THE ISRAELITES. Protestants of Judaism. According to the opinion of the Rabbins, this sect took its origin about the middle of the eighth century of the Christian era ; but the Karaites themselves claim greater antiquity, and assert that they were in existence before the destruction of the first temple. Their only book is the Pentateuch, the literal sense of which they follow with scrupulous exact ness ; and eveiy one considers it essential to transcribe it at least once in the course of his life. There are about forty families of this sect at Constantinople, where they have a separate synagogue in the village of Khas-Koi, on the shores of the Golden Horn. Some also are found at Bagdad and in Egypt; but the most numerous com munities are in Gallicia and the Crimea. The Karaites of Turkey are independent of the Jewish community, pro perly so called, and have a particular chief of their own (milleti bashi), who represents them before the Divan There are also at Constantinople and Alexandria small colonies of Jews, composed of families not originally belonging to the empire, but who have emigrated at different periods from Italy, Germany, and England. These preserve their nationality, together with all the privileges enjoyed by foreign subjects ; they are repre sented at the Divan by the legations of Tuscany, Austria, or England, and are very superior in point of education to the rest of their brethren in Turkey. There is in Salonica6 also a sect peculiar to that city 6 Two-thirds of the population of this city are Jews. They had already settled there in the time of St. Paul, and had founded a college, which became celebrated over all Europe for the learning of its pro fessors."], [394, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter VIII. 358 called the sect of the Mamins (in Turkish, deumneh) ; it is composed of Jews, originally converted to Islamism, and adopting all its external signs, whilst they adhere secretly to the observances of the Jewish religion. These sectaries, in number about six or seven thousand, inter marry only with each other, and live entirely isolated ; they are assimilated in civil matters to the Musulmans, as the former body is to the Europeans. They are principally engaged in the trade of tobacco used for smoking, whence they are designated in the official acts of the Porte as dhoukan tudjdjari tha'iferi (community of merchants of tobacco for smoking). III. Government and Administration. Of the five communities subject to the Porte, that of the Jews is unquestionably the best administered. At its head is the grand rabbin (khakham-bashi ) of Constanti nople, chosen by the notables, and assimilated, according to the tenor of his bairat, to the patriarchs of Christian communities. Like them, he may be deposed, either at the pleasure of the Porte, or in consequence of the complaints of his people. He is provided by the nation with a residence and a moderate pension for his support. The khakham-bashi is assisted by a council of six members (daianim), three of whom are rabbins, and three lay members, the former being appointed for life, the se cond annually. This council is of very ancient institution, and is the depositary of the legislative power. It has the right of convoking the national assembly, either for the election or deposition of the khakham-bashi, or for the"], [395, "Letter VIII. 359 THE ISRAELITES. adoption of any great measure that concerns the general interests of the community. The council itself first dis- , and then proposes, whatever matters are in question to the assembly, in such a manner that the latter has only to accept or reject them. The judicial authority is vested in a tribunal (Bet-din) consisting of three permanent members, who are chosen from among the citizens the most conspicuous for age, intelligence, and virtue. This tribunal has the power of judging matters both civil and religious, and its decisions are always characterised by the strictest equity. The ordinary administration of justice within the juris diction of the grand rabbinate of Constantinople is con fided to two tribunals, one of which sits at Khas-kbi, the other at Balata, a quarter of Constantinople adjoining the Fanar. Each of these tribunals is composed of four rabbis, named for life by the national assembly. The proceedings in these courts are almost gratuitous : in civil matters they take cognizance of all disputes between Jews themselves, or between Jews and foreigners, provided both parties consent. Such is their reputation for equity, that both Greeks and Armenians, notwithstanding the contempt that they openly profess for the Jewish race, have been often found submitting their disputes with Jews to the decision of the Bet-din in preference to their own tribu nals. On the other hand, there is no example of an Israelite appealing to a Christian or Musulman tribunal from one of his own nation. These tribunals cannot in any-case condemn to capital punishment, but are competent to inflict fines, imprison-"], [396, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter VIII. 360 ment, and the galleys for a bmited time. It belongs to the Turkish authorities to carry the sentences into execu tion, on the demand of the khakham-bashi. This func tionary may, by the voluntary choice of the community, become a member of the bet-din, but he is not so in right of his office. In law his judicial attributes are a nullity ; and, strictly speaking, he is nothing more than the official delegate of the nation to the Porte. As there is no religious hierarchy among the Jews, each synagogue is independent, and the khakham-bashi of Constantinople enjoys no supremacy over the grand rabbins of other cities, whom he can neither appoint nor remove, being simply charged with officially transmitting to them the orders ofthe Porte : the administration in the provinces is exactly modelled upon that of the capital The prin cipal sites of the Jewish population possess, in propor tion to their relative importance, a certain number of grand rabbins, divided into two classes, elected, like the khakham-bashi, by the notables, and exercising the same jiowers. Each city has a bet-din, with function? similar to those of the bet-din of the capital ; and the rabbi, or a member of the bet-din, represents the community before the pasha or governor. This system of administration is both simple and honourable. All offices are conferred by election, and the most worthy candidate is generally chosen ; a circumstance which may be attributed to the limited number of citizens, to the slightness of the remu neration, and to the spirit of nationality7 which is so re markable in the Jewish race. The smaller localities are administered by inferior"], [397, "Letter VIII. THE ISRAELITES. 361 rabbis,7 who are nominated by the rabbins of larger cities, and are also under their control.

Tho administration of the finances in the capital is intrusted to a commission of five members, elected by the general assembly, and renewed every second year. They draw up a schedule of imposts, and fix the rate in propor tion to the resources of each head of a family. Fiscally, the nation is divided into three classes : first, those who are in easy circumstances, and who may be reckoned as one-fifth of the community ; secondly, the indigent, who pay nothing, and depend upon alms ; and, thirdly, those who, though not rich enough to pay taxes, can yet main tain themselves without charitable aid. 7 Rabbi, or rabbin. The word was originally used in three forms : \u2014 Sab, rabbi \u2014 rabbin or rabboni.

The synagogues are supported by subscriptions and voluntary donatious, the proceeds of which are more than sufficient for the purpose. Constantinople contains thirty seven synagogues, situated in those quarters and villages of the Bosphorus where the Jewish population chiefly abound \u2014 as E>jebali, Balata, Piri Pasha, Khas-kbi, Ga lata, Orta-koi, Kourou-Tchesmeh, Arnaout-keui, Kouns koundjouk, and Dagh-Hamam. The number of private places of worship, or oratories, exceeds ninety. Every quarter has also its special magistrate, or Regi- dor,* charged with the superintendence of the municipal police and of public morals. He also exercises a censor- ship over whatever concerns internal or domestic tran- quillity ; sees to the enforcement of regulations affecting the public weal ; and has the right of entering any house to assure himself that its inhabitants are at home at the prescribed hours, and observe a regular conduct in all 'things.

These schools are very nume rous, aud are under the direction of rabbis of the second rank Wherever there is any considerable number of Jews congregated in the same spot, there a school is always to be found ; but the instruction is as meagre as le, and does not even include the elements of the Hebrew language : the masters use the language common to the Jews of Turkey, a sort of dialect, the foundation of which is Spanish, mingled with indigenous or foreign words \u2014 Turkish, Arabic, Greek, or Italian, according as these languages prevail in the respective localities. Youths who are intended for a rabbinical career re- ceive a superior education in the classes attached to the libraries (yeschirot). The origin of these libraries, which supply the place cf high schools, may be traced to a very ancient traditional custom almost coeval with the time of the prophets. A Jewish scholar, or a citizen of wealth, dying, leaves a valuable library, collected at great pains and expense. He bequeaths it by will to his heirs, adding a sum of money or realised property, the interest of which is to be devoted to the instruction of a certain number of poor students. The library then becomes a place for study, as its name (yeschirot) indicates ; a college for the lectures of professors, who are paid out of its revenues. These foundations, resembling in some respects the Turk- ish Vacoufs, are frequent among the Jews in Turkey, and are encouraged by the public, which contributes to the support of the students. The condition of the latter is nevertheless very poor, but their poverty is both a stimulus to exertion and a safeguard from evil.

THE ISRAELITES. 365 commentators, they undergo an examination in Hebrew theology, in which they generally exhibit considerable proficiency, as the reputation which many subsequently acquire by their writings evinces. IV. i and Intellectual Condition. The Jews of Turkey reside principally in cities and in the trading ports of the Levant and commercial towns of the interior, where they follow the business of brokers in the bazaars, or engage in retail traffic. Most of them are 7 O C members of the different guilds ; and especially those of the traders in tin and hardware, dealers in secondhand goods, and lapidaries, consist almost entirely of Jews. Rarely do we see the Jews of Turkey in any elevated position, or following any of the liberal professions; and such of the nation as are distinguished by their wealth as merchants, or their skill as medical practitioners,1 or whose science and talents shed lustre on their community, will generally be found to belong to the colonies of Euro pean Jews already mentioned. Thus, as we perceive, the Jews are the poorest of all the subjects of the Porte. To form an idea of their poverty it is only necessary to ride, on any day of the week, through the quarter of Balata, where the Jews of the capital chiefly dwell. Few more filthy places can be found ; the observer is afflicted by an appearance of misery, resulting not from design, as in the neighbouring 1 In the first rank stand M.

Letter VIII. quarter of the Fanar, but from real poverty : whilst in the street his path is constantly crossed by men in ragged garments, with haggard countenances, wearing an anxious expression. The half-opened windows of the low, damp houses reveal glimpses of women of small stature, thin, wan-looking, and of a livid paleness, wearing no veil, but a coarse linen cloth round the head ; and surrounded by a swarm of meagre, dropsical, rickety children, the whole forming a sad and distressing spectacle. The indigence of the Turkish Jews, which is only to be equalled by their ignorance, arises in a great measure from their aversion to anything like progress, and their preferring to remain stationary in the midst of the move ment taking place around them, wherein other nations, Turks, Greeks, and Armenians, take a more or less active share. Formerly, when the Christian and the Musulman were equally ignorant, almost all diplomatic or commer cial relations were conducted by the Jews, who still pre served some traces of the learning and intellectual culture which their ancestors brought from Spain, and who were particularly skilled in the Eastern languages. The most ancient, and, for a long time, the only printing-press, with European types, at Constantinople, was established in the house of a Jewish rabbi named Ines Castro : aud we find the Jews employed as interpreters, both to the Porte and to foreign consuls and ambassadors, long before the Greeks. At a later period they occupied still more important posts in the Ottoman government \u2014 and the cus toms, the mint (which afterwards passed to the Greeks and Armenians), and the principal banking firms were all in their hands.

In 157G, under Selim H., the Jews obtained the privi lege of having two printing-presses, one at Constantinople, the other at Salonica. This gave a fresh impulse to learn ing, and served to multiply throughout the East copies of their Law, which had become very scarce. Many learned rabbis and other distinguished Israelites were thereby induced to quit their own country and repair to Turkey.

If, however, the Israelite has intellectually degenerated and sunk to the lowest rank among the subjects of the Porte, on tbe other hand this inferiority is redeemed by economical and moral virtues which raise him in cha racter far above the generality of the Christian ra'iahs. No community is so well administered as the Jewish. Religious apostacy is extremely rare amongst them ; their morals are strict, and occasion no scandal ; and the only abuses are those caused by the absolute power of the rabbins, and the puerile restrictions which they often im pose on their flocks, pretending a Scriptural authority for so doing \u2014 as, for instance, forbidding the use of meat which has not been killed by an authorised butcher, pro- Qg every Israelite from appearing in the streets on the Sabbath day who is wearing or carrying any object not of the strictest necessity, &c, as a bunch of keys, a watch, any ornamental trinket, or two handkerchiefs.3 Crimes and vices common among the Greeks and Armenians \u2014 3 These arbitrary prohibitions (no trace of which can be found in the Law of Moses), notwithstanding the assertions of those rabbis who in sist that the Jewish religion should be based on the Old Testament alone, have frequently been the cause of serious recriminations against the rabbis on the part of their flocks.

THE ISRAELITES. 369 such as drunkenness, fraud, extortion, robbery, and murder \u2014are unknown among the Israelites. The Law of Moses, which prescribes the strictest probity in civil transactions, is scrupulously observed. It is true that in Turkey, as elsewhere, the Jews practise usury, alleging the authority of a passage in Deuteronomy, which says, \" Unto a stranger thou mayst lend upon usury, but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury.\" \u2014 Chap, xxiii. ver. 20. Another law or custom, which the Turkish Jews oene rally observe, is an obligation on all young men to marry as soon as they attain the age of eighteen. These early marriages, commanded as a religious duty by the rabbins, are conducive to the purity of morals, but at the same time constitute one of the principal causes of the impoverishment of families by occasioning an excessive increase of population.4 Poverty in its turn engenders uncleanly habits, which are more striking among the Jews of Turkey than else where (except, perhaps, those of Poland), and the effect is a proportionate mortality. Thus, when the cholera was raging at -Constantinople in 1848, the deaths from Octo ber to the end of December were 16 per cent, among the Jews ; whilst among the Greeks the ratio was only 7 1 ; amung the Armenians 4-| ; and among the Musulmans scarcely 4.5 Let us hasten, however, to state that this want of cleanliness is not, as is sometimes supposed, a vice inhe- 4 By the same rabbinical law a wife may be repudiated after ten years of marriage without children. 5 Report of Dr. Verollot, French sanitary physician at Constantinople, inserted in the Almanack de VEmpire Ottoman, 1849.

This is the bright side of the Israelitish character. Whilst among the other ra'iahs the heaviest charges are imposed on the poor, among the Jews the rich ouly pay taxes to the state, and contribute from their own means to the expenses of jus tice, of general administration, and the support of temples and schools. Among no people, excepting perhaps tlie Ottomans, is charity so assiduously and generally prac tised. This remarkable feature of the Jewish character in all countries may be partly ascribed to their isolated condition in the midst of other nations, for it is true that their beneficence is restricted to those of then own creed and nation But have we any right to make this a re proach, when we consider the persecutions and opprobrium which they have universally encountered ? Even in Turkey, where they found more tolerance and hospitality than in any other country, humiliation still follows their footsteps, and is not confined to their treatment by the Greeks, who still bear them so fanatical a hatred that even at the present day few Jews would venture on Good Friday into the quarter of Psammatia or the Fanar, for fear of being stoned. When a Greek wishes to express the highest degree of deprecation, he says, \" God forbid that such a misfortune should happen to any one \u2014 even to a Jew!\" But this feeling extends to the Osmanlis themselves, who,"], [407, "Letter VIII. 371 THE ISRAELITES. independently of the natural calmness and equanimity of their character, have no motive for personal rancour and animosity against the Jews. If in fact it be that the Armenians bear a great analogy to the Osmanlis, the affinity between the latter and the followers of Moses is still more remarkable ; for religion forms the point of con tact. The unity of the Godhead is the fundamental prin ciple laid down alike by Moses and Mohammed ; circum cision is practised both by Jews and Musulmans ; both equally abstain from the flesh of unclean animals, and repudiate the worship of images ; and yet the Jews are regarded by the Turks with a dislike akin to that felt towards them by the Christians. It is not that they are pursued by injuries or persecutions, but simply kept at, a distance, as reprobates who have incurred the Divine wrath. Oriental fatalism reads in all things a manifestation of the mercy or vengeance of the Almighty. \" If your race is proscribed,\" say they, \" and wandering over the earth, it is because God has so willed it; and as God never commits an injustice, such chastisement can only have been inflicted on you to expiate some great crime.\" At the same time the Osmanlis hold it unjustifiable to punish the children for the sin of the parent, and therefore, whilst they despise the Jews, and freely apply to them the epithet of tchiffut {mean, avaricious), they never treat them with any particular oppression or cruelty. The Jews on their part support with patience a yoke which is neither heavy nor humiliating, since it admits no legal distinctions be tween them and the Christians, allows them to be governed by their own laws, and suffers them not to be molested either in their national customs or religion"], [408, "App. Letter VIII. 372 LETTERS ON TURKEY. APPENDIX TO LETTER EIGHTH. I. After the destruction of Jerusalem, numerous schools were established by the Jews, in which their language and literature were taught : the most celebrated of these were at Tiberias and Babylon. The Mishna, which contains the traditions of the Jews and their interpretations of Scripture, is supposed to have been compiled in the latter part of the second or beginning of the third century, by Rabbi Jehuda. From this period it was considered one of the chief treasures of Hebrew literature, and the Rabbis wrote commentaries upon it. These commentaries were at length collected into two separate works, and severally entided the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. The Jerusalem Talmud appears to have been compiled about the third century, or rather later, by the Rabbi Jochonon ; the Babylonian Talmud in the sixth century, by the Rabbi Asci. Each Talmud is divided into two parts : the Mishna, or text, and the Gemara, or commentary. The Mishna was printed in 6 vols. sol. at Amsterdam, 1698 ; the Babylonian Talmud at Berlin or Frankfort, 12 vols. sol. 1715 ; and the Jerusalem Talmud at Amsterdam. As to the schools just mentioned, it is uncertain how long that of Tiberias lasted; but the Babylonian school was broken up by the Arab conquerors 1040. The scholars"], [409, "App. Letter VIII. 373 THE KARAITE JEWS. chiefly found refuge in Spain, where they were well received, and founded schools in many of the principal cities. II. The Karaite Jews are a pure remnant of the ancient Hebrews, and an industrious, honest, hospitable race, univer sally respected by the people among whom they happen to dwell. The word of a Karaite is deemed as good as a bond. The Rabbinical Jews hate them, accuse them of heresy, and in every way calumniate them, though their only crime appears to be that they abide scrupulously by the written law, rejecting the Talmudical interpretations and additions. The principal dwelling-place of the Karaite Jews is the for tress of Dschoufout-Khaleh, near Baktiserai, in the Crimea, where there are about twelve hundred. Under the Tartar government of the Crimea they enjoyed many immunities and privileges not shared by the Greeks and Armenians, which have been greatly reduced under Russian rule. Another considerable settlement of Karaite Jews is about three days' joumey from Bagdat, in the desert of Hit. They are mentioned by Benjamin of Tudela, and six hundred years after his time Dr. Wolff found them living in the same place and exactly in the same manner. They profess to have remained in this place ever since the Babylonian captivity. When their brethren returned to Jerusalem they remained behind, and they allege that their forefathers, therefore, had no hand in the crucifixion of Christ. In order to impress the Scriptures on their hearts, they read them incessantly, and are thence called Karaites or readers. They call themselves Children of the"], [410, "LETTERS ON TURKEY.

For many interesting particulars respecting these Hebrew Waldenses, see the Travels of Dr. Clarke, of Dr. Henderson, and more recently those of Dr. Wolff. The Zoharites are another sect of Jews, who it is affirmed believe in the Trinity ; but they mysteriously conceal their doctrines. They regard the Zohar, a rab binical work of the first century after Christ, as their chief religious book. Another sect are the Chasidim, or Pietists, who likewise profess a great reverence for the Zohar, ascribe to their rabbis the power of working miracles by cabalistic means, and are most bigoted enemies not only of the Christians but of all other Jews.

A large portion of the Albanians are Christians, some being schismatic Greeks, the remainder Roman Catholics. The latter are subdivided into several phis or tribes : the most considerable is the tribe of the Myrdites, who occupy the territory between Prizren, Drin, Scodra (Scutari), Croja, Tiran (Tirana), the Gabar Balkan, and the valley of the Dibres. Ever since the emigration to Italy of the son of Iskender Bey (Scander beg), or rather since 1595, when they became finally subjected to the Porte, the Myrdites have formed a species of community, under the hereditary government of the Doda family, residing at Oros. In concert with other Catholic tribes, such as the Clementi, near the sources of the Zem and the Castrat, below Scutari, they might be able to bring into the field from twelve thousand to fifteen thousand men, which would indicate, according to the analogy of Montenegro, a population of eighty-five or ninety thousand.

In the midst of the perpetual revolutions which agitated Syria subsequent to the seventh century, the Maronites preserved in their mountain-dwellings an independence in religion and even in politics, which procured them the name of Maradites or Marada'ites (i. e. rebels), and exposed them to persecu tions, under which they would have been destroyed but for the intervention of the King of France, who, in 1659, took the Maronite Patriarch, with all his prelates, being Maronite Christians, under his protection, and commanded his ambassador at Constantinople to remonstrate in their behalf.

Diring a long period the only Protestants in Turkey were the Europeans residing in the different cities and trading ports of the Levant ; it is only since 1831 that we find English and American missionaries flockinjr to Constantinople and other parts of Turkey, for the purpose of making Protestant converts, with the aid of the Bible Society.6 Their efforts have had but partial success ; and ' out ten years before this date the Society of American U ists* had commenced sending missions to Armenia, Georgia, and Persia. In 182u Messrs. Fish and Parsons visited Asia Minor ; in 1 \u2022 Grindley penetrated into Cappadocia. Some years later Messrs. Smith, Dwight, and Dittrieh travelled through Armenia. \"We eulogize,\" says M.

This want of success has not been occasioned by any obstacles raised by the Porte (the Ottoman government, iinmoveable in its apathy, as in its principles of toleration, having left the field entirely open), but is rather to be found in the fact that Pro testantism, with its rigid and severe forms, has little chance of success by its own attractions in the East, where, above all things, an appeal should be made to the eyes and the imagination. Thus we find that, within twelve or thirteen years from the time of their first ap pearance in Turkey, the Protestant missionaries had made but very few converts. The missionaries, perceiving this, without abandoning the conversion of the Jews (which was the object to which they had originally almost exclusively devoted themselves), began to turn their attention to the Christian subjects of the Porte, and particularly to the Armenians, who seemed to be more vulnerable than the rest. We accordingly find that subsequent to the above mentioned date the Protestant missionaries maintained a constant intercourse with various Armenian families, and that many members of this community assidu ously frequented the Protestant churches on Sundays of these distant excursions; and if their religious propagandism bas not been crowned with success, we are at least indebted to them for excel lent geographical observations, as well as for local details of manners and customs, which are extremely valuable, by completing portions of the travels of Chardin and Tavernier.''\u2014 Seo Bort:, L' Armenie, p. 52, in the collection of the ' Univers Pittoresque .' s3"], [430, "App. Letter IX.

After 1845 the number of Arm who had thus de facto broken through their allegiance to the church was so considerable, that not only the patri arch, Monsigre Matthew, thought himself called upon to exercise a stricter surveillance over his flock, but that Russia (in quality of protectress of orthodoxy, and even of non-orthodoxy, in the Eist) took alarm, and addressed energetic remonstrances to the Porte through the medium of her ambassador. She instigated the Greek patriarch to fulminate an interdict against the new dissenters, and even to obtain certain repressive measures against them, which were conceded by the weakness of the Porte : and which, exaggerated by public rumour, soon assumed the appearance of a persecution, and called forth the interven- tion of the representatives of the two great Protestant powers at Constantinople \u2014 England and America. \" From this moment,\" says an English writer (whose unfair treat- ment of myself personally I shall abstain from imitating\"), \" there began a series of persecutions in the metropolis and principal cities of the empire. The converts were every- where cited before the episcopal synods, and every means tried to compel them to abjure their new creed.

These rigorous measures only served to aggravate the evil they were intended to repress ; and hastened, instead of retard ing, the crisis. At the beginning of 1846 several hundred Armenians in Constantinople and the provinces, and chiefly in that of Nicomedia, openly embraced Pro testantism.8 A priest, named Vartanes, whose character was afterwards called in question, was of the number. The patriarch, more and more alarmed, and anxious to strengthen the bonds which held his flock to their allegi ance, caused a sentence of excommunication to be pub lished in all the parishes of the capital against the new sectarians, enjoining the faithful, under the most terrible threats, to break off all relations with them. \" Whoever,\" says the excommunication, \" has among them a son or a brother who has joined the dissenters, and gives him bread, or treats him in any way as a friend, must be made 7 Edward Mie helsen, 1 a Empire and its Resources.

Frequent communications have been held on the subject between the patriarch and the Porte ; several of the new converts have been called to appear before the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who has closely questioned them.

Four years after the adoption of this measure, which, though it remedied present abuses, gave no security for the future, the Sultan conceded the complete emancipation of the Protestant raiahs, permitting them to be recognised as a distinct national body, like the Latins (November, 1850), and to be represented at the Porte by a civil chief of 9 13th February, 1846."], [433, "App. Letter IX. 397 THE PROTESTANTS. their owu Since this time the Porte has constantly extended to the Protestants all the advantages and privi leges enjoyed by other ra'iah communities, and confirmed them specially by the ferman ofthe 6th of June, 1853.1 The number of Protestants in Turkey, according to the highest estimate, does not exceed two thousand : nearly all belonging to the Armenian nation They are divided into ten small communities or parishes, three of which are at Constantinople and in the suburbs, and the seven others at Broussa, Ismid, Adabazar, Merzefan, Trebizond, Erze roum, and Aintab. A small body of Protestants reside at Jerusalem under the pastoral care of the Anglican bishop Gobat. The Anglican see of Jerusalem was established in 1841 by the exertions of the Anglo-Prussian mission, sent to Palestine for the special object of converting the Jews. Four years after (September, 1845) a ferman was obtained to authorise the erection of a Protestant church at Jerusalem.

But even if all these people vvere able to read, and very few can do so, the trans lations made for their use are generally too imperfect and faulty to be intelligible to the multitude ; and so it often happens that, instead of the happy results the missionaries 3 See Missionary Researches in Armenia, by F.

The Romish mis sionaries adopt a different course. They begin by making themselves a part of the population whom they seek to convert, adopting their language and habits, and assimi lating themselves in all respects as nearly as possible to the inhabitants of the country. Through heat and through cold they toil on foot over the most savage and desert regions ; nor are they ever seen mounted on the backs of mules, accompanied by wives and children, and encum bered by a camp equipage, tents, mattresses, and all the conveniences of life, like the train of a pasha travelling to take possession of his government.\" 4 I am glad to place side by side with this testimony, which, coming from a Roman Catholic, may be suspected of partiality, that of Mr. Slade,5 an English naval officer and a Protestant : \u2014 \" The Protestant missions,\" says he, \" are much vaunted : doubtless they cost large sums, but the good they do is as a drop in the ocean com pared to the good works of the Roman Catholic church, silently and modestly performed in ail parts of Turkey.\" \u00b0 4 Bore, L' Arm&nie, p. 52. 5 Now a Bear-Admiral in the Ottoman service, under the name of Mushaver Pasha. 8 Slade's Records of Trace!, vol. iii. chap. xx. of the French translation. \" Independently of moral qualifications, which apparently are not very seriously investigated by tbe appointers of missionaries, it is rea sonable to suppose that other qualifications are considered indis}.' particularly a knowledge of languages.

The conduct of the Eastern Christians in general affords of itself a strong obstacle to the success of Pro- testant missionary efforts among the Mohammedans. Whilst the Turk implicitly believes the tenets of his religion, keeps its precepts, obeys its laws, and evinces his belief by his practice, praying in public when the hour of prayer arrives, the Christian, on the contrary, seems ashamed of his religion : the Protestants especially, until within recent years, had seldom, in countries where their numbers happened to be few, any churches or public worship of their own.

The gross superstitions and ridiculous ceremonies of the Eastern churches, their images and tinsel, are objects of contempt, and abhorrence to the true Musulman, who prides himself on the rigid puritv of his own faith, and regards the followers of these outward shows, as in fact they are regarded by many Protestants, in the light of idolaters ; and as for the Western churches, the refuse of Europe has too often furnished the model of their Christianity, as it was displayed by the swarm of ignorant Italians, Frenchmen, See., who, exiled from their native country for some crime or political offence, sought their fortunes in Turkey, and there unfortunately became the type of the Europeans, who have consequently been supposed to be habitual drunkards, atheists, and a tomed to indulge without restraint in every grosser rice \u2014to say nothing of the defects of want of truth and"], [439, "Note.

Missionaries, in their religious discussions with the Osmanlis, should never lose sight of these facts ; unfortunately, hitherto, they have either been unaware of them, or have left them out of view. And to this may be attributed a great part of their ill suc cess in making Moslem converts. The first thing necessary is to prove to the Turks that the Christianity they have mostly seen is really no Christianity at all. It is not by words that this can be effected, but by a reference to facts. Hitherto the Turk has had an example before him which contradicted the precepts of those who proposed to be come his instructors. There is reason, however, to hope that the separate Protestant communities which are now being formed among the Greek and Armenian converts will go far towards furnishing the proof that has hitherto been wanting. As yet the results have been encouraging. The new proselytes have shown honesty, straightforward ness, and earnestness in maintaining their faith, and a simplicity and purity in their religious worship which have already produced a most favourable impression on the Turks, who have been heard to remark, \" that, if this be Christianity, they can understand how nations have become powerful and prosperous by possessing it. \" Ro man Catholicism undoubtedly has had, and may continue to have, very great success amongst the ra'iah populations, but irs outward forms and ceremonies render it peculiarly repugnant to the Musulman.

We have always argued the most important results, political as well as religious, from the great movement which has of late taken place among the Eastern churches.

He did not deny that in the Turkish dominions, notwithstanding the greater freedom allowed to the Christian population, and the pro gress they had made, there had been occasional out breaks of violence ; but they were local and not general, and had been caused by some ill-conducted fanatics.

Mr. Layard made a statement which had been confirmed by the American missionaries, namely, that there were forty towns and villages in which there were distinct congregations of Pro testant seceders from the Greek Church.2 Twenty-five years ago not a single seceder was to be found. Now there were sixty-five regularly appointed Protestant teachers, and in Constantinople about fourteen schools belonging to these seceders. In Turkey free scope was allowed to every religious movement, and there had been no hin drances except from the Greek and Armenian priesthood.3 Associations, open and recognised, were permitted for religious purposes ; printing-presses had been established at Constantinople, Bucharest, and other great towns, where the Scriptures were printed in every Oriental language, and for circulation among Turkish people. There were forty Bible depots in Turkey, where Bibles were freely sold, and colporteurs were allowed freely to perambulate the country circulating the Scriptures. Now contrast this with what was done in the Russian dominions, and it 2 Lord Dudley Stuart states that, when he was recently at Constan tinople, having occasion to address some inquiries to an American missionary with whom he was acquainted, the latter was obliged, in order to answer, to examine this question very closely, and he found that, instead of forty distinct Protestant congregations, there were sixty, having among their members Greek, Armenian, and even Musul man converts. 3 See p. 394."], [442, "Note.

He now begged the attention of the House to the contents of a ferman, under the sign-manual of the Sultan Abdul Medjid himself, whereby religious liberty was effectually secured. The terms were as complete as it was possible for them to be ; it ran thus :\u2014 \" ' To my Vizir, Mohammed Pasha, prefect of police in Constantinople. When this sublime and august man date reaches you, let it be known that hitherto those of my Christian subjects who have embraced the Protestant faith have suffered much inconvenience and distress. But, in necessary accordance with my imperial compassion, which is the support of all, and which is manifested to all classes of my subjects, it is contrary to my imperial plea sure that any one class of them shoidd be exposed to suffering.

Let us now endeavour to concentrate in a brief summary the facts and statements put forth in the present volume. And first with regard to the different nations subject to Turkish rule : having considered them severally, and described with all the accuracy and impartiality in our power their past and present condition, their advancement in civilisation and in education, their various characteristics, resources, social organisation, and religious and political tendencies, \u2014 let us see what share each might be likely to assume in the regeneration or dismemberment of the Ottoman empire. We must begin by discarding all belief in the practicability of a united and combined action among the Christian races of Turkey for the attainment of any common end ; for of all hypotheses this is the most extravagant and impossible to be realised, as any im partial person who has lived six months in Turkey, and studied the subject, can testify. Whatever dislike the various raiah populations entertain of their Turkish rulers is nothing compared to their detestation of each other ; and sooner than co-operate in the work of establishing the supremacy of the Christian over the Musulman element by their joint efforts, they would continue to endure centuries of bondage ; and probably any one of them \u2014 Greek, Armenian, or Latin \u2014 would even unite with the Turk to prevent the ascendancy of the others, vol. il \u2022 t"], [446, "Conclusion.

Havino- therefore dismissed as wholly chimerical the idea of a combination of the Christian raiahs for any pur pose whatever \u2014 whether as a levee en masse against Musul man domination, or in aid of some hostile power invading the Ottoman territory \u2014 it remains to be seen which of these . taken singly, or whether any of them, is likely to prove dangerous to the Turkish power. To begin with the Armenians. Of a purely oriental character, loving tranquillity and repose \u2014 those of them who dwell in cities, wholly occupied in commerce or sedentary pursuits, preferring the pen to tbe sword\u2014 they have, as we have shown in a previous letter, many points of affinity with the Turks, and many interests iu common with them. Their position in Turkey is easy, prosperous, and secure, and they would gain nothing by a change ; unless, indeed, it were to bring about the restoration of their national independence, and realise the fondly cherished dream of their philosophers and learned men : but the time for this seems still far off. Whatever hopes they may formerly have conceived of aid from Russia have been deceived and betrayed, and they are not likely to trust her again. The popish fraction of the Armenian nation, known by the name of united-Armenians, is too inconsiderable to possess any weight, even if it were not too much occupied and weakened by internal dissensions and religious disputes. Tbe Latin raiahs and the Jews have no inducement to turn against the Porte, which exercises over them a mild and paternal government so long as they punctually"], [447, "Conclusion.

They have no political nationalities to be reconstructed, and nothing, in fact, to desire beyond what they already enjoy. As to the Jews, they look for re storation to their holy city and kingdom when the appointed period shall arrive, but they do not expect that event to tened by the agency or intervention of any human power. Meanwhile they live contentedly ; unmolested, indeed rather favoured, in a country where there is no religious persecution, and where they are in fact often protected by Turkish soldiers from the only persecution that assails them \u2014 the fanatical and savage attacks of the Greeks at Easter-tide.1 Of all the ra'iah races, then, the Greeks alone, seen through the magnifying and embellishing vista of classical associations, have appeared likely to become formidable to the Turkish power, and many sanguine persons have imagined that the Greeks, possessing within themselves the elements of political regeneration, were destined to rise out of the ashes of Turkey and resume a glorious position among nations. Without however going so far as this, there certainly has been a very general expecta tion, ever since the commencement of the hostile attitude between Russia and Turkey, that the Greeks ofthe Turkish empire, seizing the favourable opportunity, would rise in a body and side with the power that appeared both able and willing to aid them in throwing off the intolerable yoke, 1 At Athens, as is well known, this fanatical hatred against the Jews is allowed to rage unchecked \u2014 nay sometimes rather encouraged by the Government.

A con trary opinion has been expressed throughout the preceding pages, and we now ask, has not that opinion been amply justified by recent events ? What has been the result of all the secret machinations employed to procure a general rising of the Greeks in the Turkish empire during the many months that have elapsed since Prince Menschikoff landed at Constantinople ? Of the clamours about persecution, \u2014 the cry of '; Christianity in danger,' \u2014 the \" holy war\" proclaimed by the Czar for the alleged defence of the orthodox faith and for the boasted purpose of placing the Greek cross on the dome of St. Sophia, \u2014 the calls to arms, repeated in Russian journals and responded to by those of Athens, the enrol ment of troops and the crusade publicly preached at Athens against the Turks, and the formation of a \" Greco- Sclave\" legion which was to become a rallying-point and a nucleus for all the Christian population of Bulgaria and Roumelia \u2014 what has it all led to? what mighty effects have ensued ?

The attacks on the Turkish frontier by Grivas, Kara-Tassos, and the other Klephtic leaders, in the name of \" patriotism,\" and with the sanction and encouragement of the sovereigns of the Hellenic kingdom,2 not only failed to call forth any sympathy among the Greeks of Constantinople and the rest of the Turkish empire, but were met by them with the most formal aud emphatic disapproval.

In fact, the Greeks themselves in the Ottoman dominions form a sounder estimate of their own position, strength, and interests, than those who, professing to stand forth as their champions, claim for them the sympathies of Europe, and advocate a restoration of the Byzantine Empire on the ground of the services rendered by the ancient Greeks to the cause of freedom and knowledge. It is common to state that three-fourths of the population of the Turkish Empire are Christians, and then to go on arguing as if they were all Greek Christians ; and further, to assume that being Greek Christians they must be of the Greek race. We have more than once in the preceding pages warned our readers against this error, which, originat ing in confused ideas of history and geography, confounds the ancient Greeks of Athens and Sparta with the mongrel races that populated the Lower Empire, mixing up under the name of Greek almost all the Christian populations of Turkey, including in the number the Albanians, who are Skipeters3 by race, and a large portion of them Maho- in of the Albanians.- The Illyrians were probably the original stock from which the Albanians sprang. Ptolemy mentions a tribe of Albani, with a town called Albanopolis. In the twelfth century we read of their town under the name of Albanou or Erbanou: it is said to have commanded the passes from the country around Lychnitis to the East. From this people the Byzantine Greeks gave to the inha bitants of the mountains who spoke the same dialect the name of Albanetes (AXfrnvni) (AXfavat) : hence the European name of the country.

The real Greeks, in fact, constitute a very small portion of the population of the Turkish empire,4 and they are well aware that they too small a minority to dream of vanquishing the dominant race, even if there were no other obstacle to the attempt. Recent discussions in Parliament concerning the \" East ern question,\" and the relative position of the Greeks and -. have called forth assertions and sentiments which show to what an almost incredible extent erroneous no tions prevail even amongst public and practical men (some of whom have visited the very countries themselves), as to the Turkish oppression under which the Greek Christians are supposed to be groaning.

It will be seen that the second objection, namely, that \" a Greek cannot become a magistrate,\" is founded on a remarkable ignorance of tacts, and of everything relating to municipal organisation in Turkey. It will further be seen that not only do the Greeks at the present day become magistrates and - of their own communes, but that they rise to some of the highest and most influential posts of the Turkish empire, are accredited by the Sidtan as am- dors at the principal courts of Europe,8 and en trusted with the most important interests of the Otto man empire in relation to foreign powers. And to show that this is no innovation, but has been the case for centuries past, we need only recal the names of Panayoti, of Mavrocordato, and other eminent Greeks, mentioned in the first letter of this volume,9 and the history of the Greeks of the Fanar, who long held the high dignities of princes and governors of Walachia and Moldavia. \" The religious and political privileges which the Sul tans, from the time of the conquest, had accorded to their Christian subjects, were confirmed and extended soon after the accession of the present Sultan by the khatti slforif of Gul-Khane, whereby the equal rights before the f all the subjects of the Sultan, whether Christian or Musulman, were recognised ; the protection of their lives, honour, and fortunes guaranteed ; a just system of im- 8 The present representative of the Sultan in England is a Greek gentleman, as was also the late ambassador of the Porte to France. 9 See page 53"], [453, "Conclusion. 417 THE GREEKS. posing and collecting taxes, a regular mode of recruit ing the army, and a fixed term of military service intro duced. Many other measures have since been adopted equally liberal in principle and equally advantageous to the Christians. Councils for the administration of local affairs, in which the heads of the different Christian and Jewish communities have seats along with the Turkish authorities, have been established in all the principal cities of the empire ; and also courts of law for the settle ment of commercial and other civil suits, in which Christ ians are placed on the same footing as Musulmans. '\u25a0All forced labour (called corvee) and contributions levied for military and other purposes ; all irregular impositions, amniahs, and compulsory presents to the authorities, for merly so oppressive to the raiahs, have been abolished and declared illegal.

Look also at the history of the Greek monasteries \u2014 respected by Turks, and plundered by Christians. From the time of the conquest, and through all the uudes of the Ottoman empire, these establishments were invariably protected and even favoured by the Porte.1 No sooner did Greece become an indepen dent kingdom than the Government seized their lands, their flocks, their houses, and all their possessions, turning the monks adrift to get their livelihood as they could. And let it not be said that these monks were lazy useless drones, whom it was a benefit to get rid of: poor, rate, ignorant, and superstitious they might be, but they were laborious, frugal, and hospitable : they tended their 3 The two former were ruined by the Greek Revolution ; the latter still exists.

During the Greek revolu tion the monastery on Mount Helicon, though for a long time in possession of the Musulman troops, was spared and even protected by them ; and only a few weeks ago5 the monks of Mount Athos sent to implore the Turks to come and protect them against the intended visits of their co religionists, who, under the command of Grivas, and in defence, as they alleged, of the Christian religion, were overrunning and plundering the neighbouring province of Thessaly.6 Let us glance at the history of Samos. Its in habitants at the revolution threw off the Turkish yoke, and hastened, as soon as Greece was proclaimed an independent kingdom, to migrate in numbers to her shores. But their reception so little answered their expectations, that the greater part of them returned and voluntarily replaced themselves under Musulman rule. The Porte received them with indulgence, and uniting Samos, Patmos, and several smaller islands, into one government, placed them under the control of the Greek prince Vogorides, with the privilege of administering their own affairs, appointing their own magistrates, and bearing a national flag.7 5 This was written in June 1854. 6 The Commission for the settlement of the Greek question values the losses of the Turkish state by the ravages of the Hellenic bands at 120 millions of piastres, or about 1,000,000/. sterling. \" Tlie disturbances in Samos some time after this were occasioned by the people rising against their magistrates, whom they accused of malversation of the public money.

Hydra, Spezzia, and Psara were exempt from the kha radj, on condition of each contributing annually a quota of men to the Ottoman navy.8 These men served under their own chiefs, were independent of the Turkish officers, and treated not only with kindness, but with consideration and respect.

If the father of a family hap pened to die whilst the children were young, the survivors were exempt from paying the tax until the eldest son became of age to marry. The fervent believers in Turkish tyranny may be rather surprised at the following contrast between Greek persecu tion and Musulman tolerance. The circumstance occurred in 1846. The authorities of the Greek Church at Con stantinople cited a large number of persons to appear before them, from whom they required an adhesion to certain religious views insisted on by the authorities. On these persons declining to give the required adhesion they were treated with great rigour ; sentence of ex communication was passed on them by the patriarch, in which women, and even children, were included : bakers were forbidden to furnish them with bread, and water carriers to supply them with water, under pain of sharing in the excommunication. These proceedings at length came to the ears of the Porte : the Greek patriarch was summoned, and informed by the vizir that, liberty of con science being the law of the Turkish empire, persecutions on account of religion could not be allowed, and the patriarch was in consequence obliged to desist from the course he was pursuing.

Besides the schools and colleges which, from the period of Selim III. to that of the Greek revolution, continued to rise and flourish on all sides, we must remember tbe wonderful progress of the Greek navy \u2014 the Mediterranean covered with ships built, manned, and owned by Greeks ; factories established by Greek merchants in all the chief trading cities of the world ; and the internal commerce of Turkey itself almost wholly in the hands of these active and en terprising raiahs.'

We will only refer to one more evidence that the \" in tolerable and grinding nature of Musulman rule\" is an expression greatly exaggerated, even where Greeks are in question.

I have received a copy of it from the Porte : no time will be lost in pro mulgating it ; and I have reason to hope that this great act of long-withheld justice will be followed by other proofs of the Sultan's comprehensive beneficence, and of the improved spirit prevalent among his Musulman sub jects.

Some months ago, if we had replied to these assertions by pointing to the fact that there never was a time when the Christians in Turkey enjoyed such perfect security and equality of rights as at the present moment, we should probably have been told that the Porte, in con ferring new privileges, liberties, and protection on its Christian subjects, had yielded to the agency of diplo macy at Pera \u2014 to the presence of the allied forces in the Bosphorus \u2014 in short, to the political exigencies of the mo ment.

How is it that the Turk is suddenly endowed with all those good qualities which we thought it impossible for a Musul man to possess, and exempt from those bad ones which we were taught to believe inseparable from his character ? And what is the inference to be drawn from all the foregoing facts? The answer is obvious. Either the Turks have been hitherto grossly misjudged and mis- represented, and the cruelty, despotism, and intolerance ascribed to them very much exaggerated ; or they are no fonger the same people they were fifty years ago, and their advancement in humauity, toleration, and what we are accustomed to call the \" Christian virtues,\" has been a real and substantive progress \u2014 not merely a superficial imitation of European civilisation and customs. Probably there is truth in both suppositions. It is at all times dif ficult for a European to draw the proper inference in matters relating to Turkey ; for what often seems, on a super ficial glance, to be a cause of her decline, proves, though an evil, to be a lesser one than she would otherwise have endured. Anecdotes are frequently quoted from ancient travellers, and from other works published at the end of the last century, in proof of the cruelties and misgovern ment of the Turks.

Perhaps, however, one of the strongest evidences we have ofthe reality aud soundness of the reforms which have taken place in Turkey is to be found in the alarm which these reforms excite in Russia. On the 30th of March 1854, Lord Palmerston stated in the House of Commons \u2014 \" I have no doubt in my own mind, and indeed it is proved in Sir Hamilton Seymour's correspondence, that among the reasons which induced Russia to strike the blow at Turkey when she did, was her plainly perceiving that the progressive improvements of Turkey were adapted to strengthen the Turkish government ; and that, in propor tion as those improvements tended to ameliorate the con dition of the Christian population, that population would gradually withdraw their gaze from Russia for support, and turn to other sources ; \u2014 that the Russian government, perceived that the Christian population of Turkey was slipping out of its hands, and the Turkish government getting too strong to be easily overthrown, and therefore Russia took that step.\" We have, indeed, every ground for believing that, had Turkey done less for tbe cause of civilisation and freedom, Europe would not have heard of the Menschikoff note, nor of the invasion of the Principalities. The late Emperor of Russia, in fact, told us himself that he dreaded the progress that has been made in every direction by the Christians in the Ottoman dominions ; he foresaw the inevitable result, and was persuaded that the time was come for making, at whatever cost, the most de termined stand against it.

But let us beware of pressing on her at this moment of her diffi culties for concessions which ought to be allowed to proceed from the motu proprio of the Sultan, and at timely and fitting moments, so as not to produce any diminution of his power or derogation of his sovereign independence. Caution in this respect was insisted on even by the late Czar himself, who declared, \" That the best way of supporting the Ottoman government is not to harass it by imperious demands, urged in a manner humiliating to its independence and dignity.\" Such was 7 See Lord Palmerston's speech already quoted. u2"], [472, "LETTERS ,0N TURKEY.

For it should be seriously remembered that statesmen in Turkey have a vast amount of prejudice, bigotry, and fanaticism to deal with ; and that the Ulema and the Dervishes, animated by mutual and bitter hostility on every other point, make common cause in preventing all reforms, and they have immense hold on the people. The increased unity of the political and administrative . a recently introduced into Turkey by the reforming spirit of the late Sultan Mahmoud II., and which consti tutes the basis of the new organization promulgated by the present sultan, Abdul Medjid, is perhaps the most, certain index of the ultimate regeneration of Turkey. At the close of the eighteenth century Turkey seemed destined tu expire in the shadow cast over her by advancing Russia. Not ouly her newly acquired territories, the conquered states aud kingdoms, began to detach them selves from her declining empire, returning to their ancient masters or their former independence, but the original domains of the race of Osman began to escajie from the feeble and indolent hands of his successors. The fair and fertile provinces of Anatolia became gradually the prey of Dere-beys (or princes of the valley), some of whom were in a condition to bring fifty thousand men into the field, and who, sheltered behind the walls of their strongholds, defied the fermans of the Porte, and tyran nised at pleasure over the surrounding population.

At the same time the placing the Christians in a position of equality with the Musulmans, by the khatti-sherif of Gul-Khane and subsequent fermans, has prepared the way for amalgamating the races by the weakening and destruction of the barriers that have so long kept them apart. Whilst the Western nations were working out their several developments with more or less of energy, Turkey, during four centuries, remained quiescent in the original conditions of her existence, her strength diminishh that of the neighbouring states, increased. Among the Turks the religious principle absorbed all others \u2014 and the Koran was the foundation, not only of their religion, but of their legal and political constitution No change could be made in any of the institutions of Turkey unless based on the Koran. Mahmoud first among the rulers of Islam discovered this truth, and the means of applying it He saw that the first step towards the regeneration of his empire was to introduce a wider interpretation of the pre- cepts of the Koran : he changed not the letter of the law, but modified its spirit, to suit the exigencies of his plan of reform. The Koran declares that \" It is lawful to employ tlie arms of the infidel for his destruction,\" and Mahmoud in troduced European arms and discipline among his troops.

Thus did he remove the chief barriers which separated Turkey from the rest of Europe, and, by the indomitable energy of his character, succeeded in the enterprise which proved fatal to his unfortunate predecessor Selim III. The present Sultan has pursued the same path, and, though it has been less rugged and dangerous to him than to Mahmoud, who led the way, it is still surrounded with difficulties. The great fault of the Ottoman government is its want cf power to secure a pure and uncorrupt administration : the great thing to be desired is, that it should be strength- ened at the core, and so enabled to acquire a more efficient control over the administration of its distant representa- tives, pashas, and other functionaries; and since, as we have shown, the Christians in Turkey have at no time been victims to deliberate injustice or systematic into- lerance, and that great efforts have been made, and are continually in progress, to enlarge the measure of their freedom and equality, surely a government in itself dis posed to be humane, just, and tolerant, should be as much as possible strengthened and assisted, and should be shielded from whatever tends to enfeeble or humiliate it. But some will still exclaim, \" How vain are all such efforts ! Civil equality, and the field thrown open to the ra'iahs ; complete emancipation, and free access to all employments in the state, are but the means and instru ments of Christian ascendancy and Turkish annihilation. The impassable barrier of separation placed originally by the Osmanlis themselves between them and their ra'iahs"], [476, "LETTERS ON TURKEY.

Tlie period will only be hastened when the Christians of Turkey will rise to the ascendancy, \u2014 all the external commerce of the country be in the hands of the Greeks, all its intelligence and progress be mono polized by them, \u2014 and the slave of yesterday, raised to be an equal, will to-morrow become the master.\" We have already given reasons for not sharing this opinion. If the Christian races, the Greeks in particular, be endowed with a more enterprising spirit, a greater apti tude for commerce and the arts ; if they have a livelier temperament, and are more busy, acute, and indefatigable in the pursuit of what they deem their interest, the expe rience of the last twenty years has, on the other hand, demonstrated that, in direct contrast with the Turks, they possess none of the great qualities necessary for founding and maintaining a mighty empire. In the words of La martine, \"A mere literary or commercial genius is not of itself sufficient to resuscitate a nation, therefore we do not entertain strong hopes for the Greeks. They in this respect resemble the people of Italy, presenting to the eye glorious groups and brilliant individualities, but no union, no body politic : \u2014 Greeks, but no Greek nation.\" Whoever will take the trouble of turning to the his torians of the Lower Empire will find in their pages con firmation of all that has been stated in these respecting the Greek character, and will be ready to acknowledge that, so far from having degenerated, the Greek of to-day is rather above than below the level of his Byzantine ancestor.

With such truths before us, it is but reasonable to think that the subversion of the Turkish empire would be to the Greeks a mere transition from one foreign dominion to another. Too feeble to stand alone, they must continue to lean on some powerful neighbour for protection. It is not a mere extension of territory, nor even all the com mercial prosperity above predicted, that would give them strength to be independent \" But,\" concludes M.
