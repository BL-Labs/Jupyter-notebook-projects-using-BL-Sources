Failings the verbal explanations of the author, it is deem- ed not superfluous, to premise a few explanations con- cerning- the accompanying play. In the first place, it was originally written in Fiench by the author, who being essentially cosmopolite, and desirous of writing a play on the lines of the true dramatic art, such as those of the three or four greatest French dramatists of the present century, (we need hardly name Scribe, Dumas pere, Victor Hugo, and their legitimate heir, par excel- lence, Sardou ;) the author wished to take advantage of the infinite resources of the most sparkling, terse, witty, and elegant of modern tongues, for dialogue at least, and prose, \u2014 (though not poetry,) in addition to the possible satisfaction of triumphing on the unrivalled French stage beside such masters of the dramatic art, as have never been surpassed or equalled in any land, except by our own phenomenal Shakespeare. Believing that the domestic life of our contemporaries is a very sterile and unpromising field, from which to elicit those dramatic scenes and adventures, we, at least, deem to be as indispensable to the plot of a play, as that plot itself (which of late it is true, seems to shine chiefly by its absence so far as any emotional or exciting incidents are concerned ;)"], [8, "1 \u2014 we selected the period of the reign of Charles the second, as being the most animated and adventurous epoch of not remote times, when gallantry, political and social intrigues, larking frolics, and duels on every occasion were the order of the day, hence quite admissible on the stage; and so cus tomary as to obviate the possibility of laying omeself open to the reproach of exaggeration or absurdity. The play however, is neither intended, nor desired to be historical. In such case, the htstorical personages should necessarily be the protagonists, on whom the main interest of the action should centre. This we took care to avoid ; the well known character of Charles, and his two favourites b, ing far too futile, and frivolous to suffer them to be in vested with any of the graver interest and nobler aspira tions, required to constitute protagonists susceptible of arouz ing and retaining the attention of an intelligent audience throughout a five act play. Accordingly the historical personages we have called up, are wholly subordinate lo the principal ones, on whom the entire plot turns. These latter being all three, purely fictive, and each typical of the class and nation they repre sent. Charles and his favourites we have been careful to de pict exactly as history, and the private records of the time have handed them down to us ; their well known wit and fun serving us for an amusing remplissage of the action and the denoument. In conclusion, we have only to add, that deeming thea tres to be essentially places of amusement, not intended to be converted into moral dissecting rooms, or tribunes for"], [9, "2 political and social disquisitions, we have chiefly aimed at rendering our drama amusing and interesting, from the first scene, to the last. And although externals are necessarily the last of our considerations, we are fain to admit the weak ness of rejoicing not a little at the thought, that our heroes will at least be able to appear in costumes so becoming and elegant, as not to render the expression of their impassioned and noble sentiments, almost ludicrous, from forming such an antithesis to the hideous and grotesque modern costume of the male sex, wherein they are at such pains to enable themselves to be mistaken for the flunkeys who stand be hind them at table. Finally we beg to state distinctly that the play has neither been paraphrased from, nor suggested by any dra matic work or novel, of which we are aware, in any known tongue."], [10, ""], [11, "The scene is laid in England.

The scene represents a part of the garden of Spring-gardens bosquets and arbours and clumps of trees are scattered about, in such a way that persons can conceal themselves amidst or behind them, so as not to see each other, yet to be visible to the spectators. It is night, and the gardens, and avenues, dimly visible in the background, are all gracefully illuminated, more or less, by coloured lanterns suspended among the trees, or scattered amidst the grassy parterres. The stage forms a more or less open space intersected by alleys and thickets opening into it. First scene. Groupes and couples of citizens, apprentices, and others, prome nading in the background, and the alleys crossing it. The marquise and fenny, enter and come to front. Both are disguised as coquettish work-girls. The Marquise. I repent having let you over-persuade me to venture here. To be frolicking in London, instead of demurely awaiting the term of my banishment in Britanny, is playing the game of my adversaries. Jenny. How can it reach their ears. Madame's declared an tipathy to England, renders it the last place, they would seek her in, and here no one can recognise her, these gardens being frequented by none but the middle and lower classes. Besides,"], [13, "3 since politics have been but a pretext to colour the personal rancour of the king ! ! Marq. All the worse. It is no joke when Louis the fourteenth takes a virulent spite against any one \u2014 a pleasant prospect, if I must await the grand climacteric to be rid of his conquering pretensions. Jen. Well, a young widow, conspicuous for beauty and wit, might expect that at the court of a monarch so gallant, she would have to chuse between his love, or his vindictiveness. Marq. As if I had not been surfeited with the coun:ry, during the life-time of the marquis. Jen. [laughing] No wonder, poor man \u2014 when, ? t sixty one has the temerity to take a wife of seventeen, so attractive and so addicted to Marq. Fascinating all those who are worth their salt. Do I deny it. One is pretty or plain; bright, or stupid. Of wr at use then are beauty and brains, except to amuse oneself. Jen. Excellent in theory, but the practice may leac , perchan ce from the court, to the Bastille, and meanwhile, from Versail les to Brittany. Marq. And from Brittanny to dull, prosaic, freezing England. Jen. (piqued] Her grace, the late duchess, did not so de preciate her native land. Marq. Oh ! my mother was British to the back bone. But from her I have inherited solely, a tincture of her exaggerated scruples, \u2014 vastly attenuated, luckily,\u2014 her ancient domains, and her native tongue. Jen. And her English beauty, surely, that item ought not to be omitted ? Marq. Decidedly, but if my' father had not leavened it with his Gallic wit, I should care little to play the part of the mask, which the fox, turning inside-out, lamented should prove vacant within, though so pretty without."], [14, "4 Jen. [laughing] That fox was wiser than men, who all to nothing prefer the exterior to its contents. Marq. [contemptuously] Such may be the rule in England, but not abroad. The worse for those cavaliers you vaunt to me. For if there be one dolt more despicable than another, it is the idiot who falls in love with a fool, for her face. Jen. [piqued] Milady will discover that there are English cavaliers, who can hold their own against all the world, if she comes across their best specimens. Marq. As if they could ever fascinate me, with their British morgue and stiffness. Jen. [maliciously] A certain French proverb asserts that it is temerity to say \"Fountain I will never drink of thy source\". (Groupes of apprentices and others gather in background, whis pering, and staring at marquise. Rochester behind them.) Marq. [uneasily] Decidedly we seem to be creating a sensa tion; and that queer-looking oaf there, who stands aloof, scru tinizing us from top to toe. If he were an emissary of Louis? every thing now causes me a panic. Jen. Oh ! that is a puritan preacher who professes to fish for souls. Marq Doubtless he fishes to good purpose, and I bet that he dedicates himself specially to redeeming the weaker vessels. Jen. Precisely, all the women swear by him, perhaps he is meditating the conversion of madame. Marq. He would lose his Latin at that task. But we are too much under observation here, I wish we were well back at home. Jen. If madame would hut deign to hearken to me. The fact is, all are on a level here.

Were it only for the sa tisfaction of realizing the effect, produced by simple miss Juliet, instead of the dazzling great lady. Mar. True, it would be a variety; at all events, my escut cheon will not be blurred by the experiment, for once. Jen. That is how to take it, since we have only come here for a lark, and see, the moths are already swarming round, to vie which shall burn their wings first and best. (enter Roger, several young men approach, saluting awkwardly. Rochester remains aloof , Jenny advances to meet Roger. The marquise in the rear, converses with the apprentices, who have come up to her, and accepting the arm of one of them, turns to go out.) Mar. [to Jenny] Await me here, Jenny, I am going to dance, (exit marquise with apprentices). (Jenny and Roger converse, in front; promenaders, pass in back ground; music is heard faintly in distance). Jen. Quick, say, is your lord Ardown coming ! Roger. Did I not engage to bring him. I had only to hold out to him something novel, uncommon. He is so satiated with drawing room successes; all the ladies throw themselves at his head. Jen. The very counterpart of my mistress,she only esteems men as toys, to experiment upon, \u2014 you have not awoke his suspi cions, I hope. Rog. I knew better than that, my dear. Jen. Provided only he should not betray himself ! Rog. No fear on that score, he is particularly anxious to keep up his disguise, and lest he should be unable wholly to dissemble his grand air and supreme distinction, he is to pass for the son of an opulent ship-owner, in Holland \u2014 a democracy, exempt from castes you conceive?..."], [16, "6 Jen. The train took fire, easily then? Rog. Like a match put to gunpowder. He has been bored to death of late. Fancy how entertaining he found the routine of his old feudal castle when just returned from sojourning in the most brilliant capitals of Europe, and being the star of the ascendent in all of them. Jen. Why did he not come up to the court then. There is no lack of fun and rollicking at Whitehall, if the scandal-mon gers are to be credited. Rog. A likely thing that the Marquis, who sent him abroad as soon as he came of age, to prevent his being involved in that vortex of dissipation, would suffer him to plunge into it when he has just recalled him to induce him to marry his cousin. Why he had not been two months in Paris, this spring, when his fa ther pelted mylord with letter after letter orderinghim summa rily to return instanter. Jen. But it is reported in France that the king is turning to devotion. Rog. It must be to the fair sex then, to judge by all the intrigues in which Charles, and his two favourites, Buckingham and Rochester, are entangled. Jen. I thought that incorrigible scamp was in disgrace ? Rog. That is but an intermittent casualty, to which his ir repressible impertinence subjects him, but with the first day of spleen or fog, he is immediately recalled, for Charles cannot exist without his right hand-man. You may guess that it is not at the school of such a trio that the rigid marquis wonld allow his son and heir to take his brevet. Jen, [hastily] Dear me, I hope the earl is not a novice. For to captivate the marquise !.... Rpg. [piqued] She must be deucedly difficult then, for all the women go frantic after him. Jen. I breathe again, you threw a wet blanket over me, for it"], [17, "7 is not the first comer that she admits to court her. Rog. Hey day ! He condescend to court any one. Learn that the genuine high style is superciliousness, indifference, and im perturbability. Mylord would derogate if ever he swerved from the supreme impassibility, the uualterable cold blood that stamp his caste. Jen. [laughing] He will have to alter bis cue, if he enters the lists with madame. Rog. Bah ! a word, a look and they are all at his beck. Only a few incognito escapades up to London have sufficed him to strike up an intrigue with the duchess of Portsmouth ! Jen. [dismayed] The beauti ful Louise de Kerouailles, but if he is in love with her'? Rog. The king's mistress ! \u2014 a man of his race ! gentlemen may tread on each other's heels, for a whim, but they do not drag their hearts in the mire after them. Jen. You reassure me, for if I did not think to do right... Rog. And / then ! do you mistake me for a stage varlet. Did I not know that you are qualified to guarantee your mistres ses antecedents.... Not the less I am in a quandary, for between the court of a Lotiis and a Charles! Jen [provoked] It is a question of leaving or taking. If he is so squeamish he should put up with a fright. Rog. Gently ! Wit, beauty, and coquetry; all three in the superlative. That isa trinity so high-spiced as logive one goose flesh all over. Not to speak of larking it in public gardens. Jen. [scornful/y] You might know that the more danger of compromising oneself, the greater the temptation. Rog. The deuce it is! and this mysterious voyage in disguise? Jen. Did I not explain to you that madame is inculpated of having participated in the cabal of her friend, the countess of Soissons, thanks to a certain great personage, who vexed at being repulsed, under cover of this pretext, had her banished"], [18, "8 to her estates in Brittanny, in hopes that she would purchase pardon at any cost. Rog. Bless me ! that irrepressible suitor of hers must be the grand Mogul at least. Jen. About as good. Therefore, when the missives, from being urgent, began to be menacing, it was full time to place oneself in safety. Rog. That should teach her not to tamper with those who can deal in requitals. I warrant you that whoever treads on my master's corns has cause to repent it. For he is peculiarly haugh ty. Imagine, if he were cut to the quick. Jen. The marquise will have found her match then, for she is a spoiled child who only needs to be reined in. Rog. If the lot falls on Lord Ardown, he is the very man to break her in. If ever she ventures to shie or kick, he will cure her of any desire to try it on again. Jen. Why then have you so vaunted him to me. I would ne ver have brought about this meeting \u2014 the sole means of overco ming her inveterate prejudices \u2014 if I thought he were to make her a bad husband. For though our own mariage will be bro ken off, unless we can fix my mistress in England, not at any price, would I lend myself to make her miserable. Rog. Miserable forsooth,\u2014 ihe may bless her stars if Lord Ardown falls in love with her. High-born, generous, intellectual; as handsome as a picture, and as brave as a lion, if he exacts the deference to which he is entitled, she has only to refrain from developing his Blue-beard instincts, by giving no cause for them. Jen. But if he is so overbearing, why don't he stick to English girls, they are earth-bound enough for any one. Rog. That's the rub. He says they are either so stupid or so silly that they bore him to death. Italian and Spanish beauties have spoiled him for insipid wax dolls. He prefers foreigners, for"], [19, "9 that reason, but the laxity of their manners and morals makes him doubt them all. (The music ceases, the promenaders begin to thicken in the background) Jen. The dancers are returning. Remember that madame is to pass for the God-daughter of a great lady who had her educated with her own children, otherwise he might suspect a mystery; and that she has run away, because they wanted to marry her to a rich farmer. Rog. Have you not dinned it into my ears enough. I am as anxious as you that our little plot should succeed, if but to se cure for myself such a saucy helpmate. But, all the same, every hair of my head stands on end at the thought of bringing to gether two such antagonists. However, I wash my hands of it; my conscience is pure. Jen. [saucily] Gospel truth, of course. (More dancers appear in the background). Rog, [hastily] Lord Ardown will be here in a moment, ac companied by my comrade Nicholas; who is to pass for your cousin. Be sure to receive him cordially. Jen. [laughing] No fear but I shall do you honour.

I will put the name on my infanta in forty eight hours, [aload] Come Jermyn, we should be indiscreet to impede any longer the manifestation of Madame's gratitude; [to Buck.] Bad luck to you, Duke! You have tripped me up again, but I will make you pay dear for it yet! [exeunt Roch. and Jermyn.] Buck, [respectfully] Hence forth madame I am convinced that you are not what you would appear. Mar. [with dignity] Your grace is right. The blood of my ancestors is not less illustrious than even yours. Buck, [dropping on one knee and kissing her hand] Ah madame1"], [51, "41 I divined it. Your features, your language, your entire demea: nour vied to reveal your noble origin. I will not be so indiscreet as to seek to penetrate your secrets. But I would fain remindt you that I am well nigh omnipotent in England, and that you; cannot do me a greater honour than to put my absolute de votion to the proof. Mar. I believe it mylord, yours is too lofty and too ancient a lineage not to have instilled into your soul the indelible remi niscences of the renowned paladins your forefathers. But the dangers which threaten me are not such as even your dauntless rapier could shield me from. Buck. Who knows madame ? grant me your confidence;. and I make bold to vaunt that I will bring to reason whoever oppresses you. Mar. Alas ! My ill fate remounts so high, that your best will would inevitably be impotent to redress it. Buck. Essay it, I beseech you; we two, combined, would be wondrously strong. Mar. Circumstances compel me to maintain absolute silence. Buck, [piqued] Nevertheless, I should be more discreet than the echoes of Spring gardens. Mar. [apologetically] I have amply reproached myself for that inexcusable imprudence. But if you only knew how despe rate I was rendered by unwonted, and intolerable ennui. Buck, [eagerly] If that is all, it depends on yourself to enjoy any amount of amusement. I engage to purvey it for you \u2014 See now. \u2014 There is a masked ball at court, to morrow night, accept my escort there. Under any disguise you chuse, you will make your unannounced apparition, on my arm, to disappear, in the same way, at your own hour; exactly like Cinderella."], [52, "42 Mar. The proposal is infinitely tempting, but I dare not risk it. I should fear too much, envious eyes, in general, and... the tete a tete in particular. Buck, [piqued] I perceive that I have an irremissable draw back; that of coming in second best, and inopportunely. But Ardown will know nothing of it. His family is at variance with the court; and he cannot go there. Besides, he is on the eve of marrying his cousin, Lady Beatrice Dudley; a beautiful girl, of large fortune, who has just been brought back from the convent, where she was educated in Paris, for the wedding. Mar. [surprised] Lady Beatrice Dudley, is it she who was at Montmartre, where she turned many heads, at the abbess's weekly receptions ? Buck. The same. Mar. [aside] My poor Marillac, you are, lucky to have a fascinating sister. Were it not for me, there would be an end of your dreams of felicity. Bueh. You reflect \u2014 May I hope to persuade you ? Mar. I will consider the question mylord. [The clock strikes] But the hour is late... My attendant will soon be here, and I would not wish... [She looks nervously at dhe clock.] Bnck. It is evident that you need a defender, since you are afraid. Mar. [proudly] What then have / to fear. Buck, [ironically] How can I tell ? That he should turn restive, lash out,\u2014 take the bit in his teeth; take vengeance. Mar. [haughtily] All those I have known hitherto, have taken nothing but patience. Buck, [looking at the clock too] [aside] So late; and Ardown comes not yet. 1 must gain time, [aloud] Ah ! Madame, beware,"], [53, "43 lest you confound the Gallic cock with the British lion. They have nothing in common save indomptable valour. The first, loquacious; gallant; sociable, good-natured, courteous, chival rous; his wit as sharp as his rapier; and as prompt to retort. His heart in his hand, and his head veering with the wind. Flinging the gauntlet as readily as the handkerchief. Breaking a lance for every thing and nothing: a whim, a word, an idea. \u2014 Always under arms, in the boudoir, as in the field, Fascinating every one, grave or gay, fanatizing censors and compe titors, foes and friends; alike by the innate daring, expansive gcnerosity,and inexhaustible verve which carry all before them; on the contrary, the king of the forest, paces his solitude, or buries himself in his lair, content to reign alone over the lioness of his choice. Careless of all others, whom he disdains and shuns, until urged by necessity, or by some wanton aggression, he issues from his retreat, putting every thing to rout at his first roar, ma king the ground quake at every toss of his mane, overleaping at a bound, all that Inrs his way. Felling each antagonist with one stroke of his formidable paws, and crushing him to death with his potent jaws. Mar. [impressed, but trying to jest] A thrilling picture; but is it not slightly exaggerated ? Buck. Not in the least. The race originates in the unparal leled amalgam of striking attributes derived from the stanch Saxon Thanes, the bold Danish vikings, and the chivalrous Norman knights whose blood flows in the veins of direct ancient lineage. All such, participate in their general characteristics. The elite alone, resume them in totality... These chosen few, always unfathomed, and unappreciated abroad, because viewed tran siently, and on the surface, form a type apart. Glaciers without; volcanoes within; they are extreae in every thing. In good, as"], [54, "44 in evil; in wisdom, as in folly, in enthusiasm as in disdain; in right, as in wrong; in calm, as in fury; in hatred as in love. Men of action rather than words\u2014 recognising no superior save God; no law, save that of honour; their word is a bond, their will a destiny. For they neither stop, nor recoil; nor stoop, nor compound; nor waver nor succumb; before whom or whatsoever; \u2014 be it bliss or despair; the throne, or the scaffold. Mar. [impressed] And by what tokens can one know them ? Buck. Whoever has once observed them in action, would recognise them any where. They are sober and taciturn. Their voice is low, their sentences are brief, their countenance is grave, their air, nonchalant. Their glance is veiled, when not fulminating. Their hand is open, but its grasp is iron. They note every thing, with half closed eyes, and are never so much to be feared as when they seem most indifferent; are too indolent to yawn, yet climb the summit of Mont Blanc for change of air. Luxurious as were the Sybarites of old,yet they pass through fire and water for a wager. They advance to the cannon's mouth, as coolly as they saunter in the mall; are always reticent, but never menda cious; and with a glance, freeze the blood of those who never knew till then what it was to quail. Mar. It is the very portrait of one I know Buck. Beware then, for this type is either fatal or sublime. There is no medium. Like the bulldog they never relinquish their hold, and when they pursue a woman such as you; they either cloister, or kill her...

Buck, [laughing] What ! but to show your mettle. It is but a question of measuring your daring with the lion. Mar. [intimidated] He will kill me if he finds you here. Buck. It is undeniable that I am slightly compromising. But I will serve you for a shield. Mar. ['wringing her hands in despair] He will begin with you Buck. Not before we have exchanged a few stoccades. Between cavaliers, homicide is not unfrequent; but, as a rule, they abstain from assassination. Mar. Ah for mercy's sake mylord, hide, fly. Buck, [haughtily] You demand too much from me,madame, I neither conceal myself, nor fly from any one. Mar. Alas, I love, and am beloved; would you then be so cruel as to blast my life for ever. Buck, [nobly] None ever threw themselves on my genero sity, in vain. Delay him at the door, while I escape by the win- dow.

Mar. [pouting] A flattering declaration. Ard. No \u2014 for it is more akin to delirium. As well compare the flame of a volcano to a farthing rush-light. Unquestionably, it is the first time that real love has ever kindled all the blood in my veins to flame, and winged my soul to its most empyrean spheres. For never yet, amidst all the fair women who have attracted me, in many lands, was there one, capable of kindling my heart, and fascinating my intellect to the same degree. You are the first, as you will be the last great passion of my exis tence. For it is not in the power of mortal man to love twice, to so supreme an extent. Mar.

It is no longer time to hesitate. My father is bent on thrusting an odious marriage on me. To put an end to all annoying complications, the only secure means is to leave them behind us.

He prepares her shipwreck on the court shoals J and reserves to himself the flotsam and jetsom of the salvage. DA.i. Ail / brinj Ardown. Roch. [surprised] The deuce you do. The barometer will run down to storm then. Duch. Certes, it must be exasperating for a lover of his ra bid type, to see one, who fooled him into mistaking her for a neophyte, practising all the arts of an experienced coquette to entangle the king and the cream of his courtiers in her nets."], [71, "61 Roch. You purpose a grand flare up then ? Duch. Nothing less sufficed. Supreme passion is blind. Ar down, frenzied with wrath and jealousy, had actually resolved to carry off his Dulcinea by force to immure her behind the grates of an Italian convent, in order to cut the grass beneath Buck ingham's feet, and doubtless to profit by her repentance, later. Roch. Not so. Englishmen of his calibre, in such cases never forgive. Those flaws in erotic or conjugal contracts, so placidly condoned in France, are prohibitive clauses here; unless indeed the culprit succeeds in throwing dust in their eyes by ultra-ma chiavelism. Duch. \\ ironically J Do you deem that beyond our powers ? Roch. No,there you are right. Duch. So right, that nothing can persuade him chat he has been duped by a practised intriguante, save seeing her in her true colours with his own eyes, wherefore I have brought him here. Roch. [sneering] Whereby you have placed your own dear self between the hammer and the anyil. Duch. How so, a stranger, disguised and masked, who will make him known ? Roch. [sneering] Who but himself, by Jove ! Duch. Would 1 have risked it had he not pledged me his honour solemnly, to make no blow-up here Roch. [sneering] In normal circumstances, that gage whould stand good for a million; but in the present, 1 would not give a brass farthing for it. Duch. (disconcerted) What! you think ? Roch. Tl-at when one has the temerity to heat a bomb to incandescence no one can calculate where, how, or when, it will explode. Add to which,.that such violent projectiles burst with a"], [72, "62 glare which force the most dazed eyes to see clear. Duch. Which figures of speech signify?. Roch. That when the rumpus reaches his majesty's ears, he will instantly fathom its origin, that too quickwitted not to divine your motives for such an imprudence, and though so easy going, being English, not the less, he will never condone having been bamboozled, if once aware of it. Duch. (startled) Happily all these formidable prognostics are baseless. No one in their senses would venture to make a row, or to draw a sword beneath the royal roof, which is high treason. Roch. (sneering) If you reckon upon that, when the blood mounts to Ardown's head, aud renders him as reckless of his own life, as of that of others Duch. Too late \u2014 he is down there, admiring the arts of his supposed novice, rendered doubly conspicuous by the swarm she gathers ronnd her. He waits for her to come this way, where he may ensconce himself behind the shrubs, and hear, as wel' see all, at his ease. Roeh. It will not be, at yours, at all events! I know that type; ami I warrant you that no crowned head could stay him, at such a crisis. Duch. Ah bah ! under the shock of this thunderbolt, he wil' rush straight home, and marry his cousin in twentv four hours, as he swore, to do, if the facts bore out my affirmations. Roch. Bad symptom, such hot haste. He would not be in so great a hurry, if he were not afraid of himself. Besides, married, hewill be lost to you, no less. Duch.

Roch, It is not by severing him from an adventuress, to marry him to a relative, young, beautiful, rich, and immacu-"], [73, "63 late: that this is likely to result. Duch. Reverse your proposition, and it changes aspect. Roch. Do you imply that this girl of noble birth. Duch. Has taken a lover in one of my compatriots, the vi comte de Marillac, one of the most briliiant of our court raffine's. Roch. How the deuce; she who has just issued from her convent. Duch. Precisely. It was at the weekly receptions of the abbess of Montmartre, who keeps open house for all the gallants of Versailles that they both fell in love. It is however, an honorable attachment. It was but to defend himself against so formidable a rival that de Marillac put the rights on his side. Roch. Pleasant, to educate one's daughters in foreign con vents. Duch. Hence the necessity of driving Ardown into the snare, at once, for alone, lady Beatrice will never dare to brave pa rents so rigid. But could de Marillac, have time to arrive; all would transpire, and my vengeance be baulked. Once married, Ardown may make the discovery at leisure. Roch. Truly, a plot worthy of you; duchess. But take care that you do not lose him who is your all in all, for one who is nothing to you. Duch. [startled] Charles can never know it. Roch, Some spiteful gossip has already reached him, if one gleam of light confirmed it, he would not relent, if you expired a his feet. Duch. [scornfully] I should still find means to cajole him, vanity is a trump card to play on. But here they all come, and Ardown at their heels. Let us clear out.

Besides, under the mask, all licence is permitted. To overawe me [with finesse] you should take it off. Mar. [coquetting] At Seville, we do nothing for nothing.

The Duke perceives the king kissing the hand wherewith the Marquise holds her mask, while with the other she endeavours to raise him. Her head is turned a way from them.] Duke [putting his finger on his lips] Hush! we are intruders here [He drags Barillon hastily behind a tuft of tall shrubs, where they seet without being visible to the king and Marquise.

I ask therefore, as a special grace from your majesty, to interdict by your royal authority, the marriage on the eve of taking place, between the earl of Ar down and his cousin, lady Beatrice Dudley. Char, [scowling] This is, in sooth, a singular request. By what right could I intervene in th's private family affair, and what matters to you the marriage of this worthy heir of a disloyal sub ject, who aspires to transplant into England the rebellious con spiracies of the ligueurs and frondeurs of France.

Personally, sire, very little, but indirectly very much. Charl. You speak in enigmas. Mar. Sire, I have a beloved brother, whose death this mar riage would occasion. Charl. (smiling) Oh! death! that is saying a good deal! You We him then exceedingly, this brother? Mar.

But if I place my crown in jeopardy, to serve you; at the very least, you should prove yourself gra teful for it. Mar.

(putting it on, and seeing the pair in distance) Who then are those? Charl. Reassure yourself, only two astute diplomatists, who would not confide to the right ear, what they had just heard with the left. Mar. (recognising them) Good heavens! the ambassadors of France and Spain! Can they have perceived us? Charl. Odds fish! to make sure of that, one need but note how studiously they avert their gaze. Mar.

So Duchess, you have got a trifle beyond your depth, methinks, Are you not slightly overmatched! for once? Duch. (irritated) This is no time to jest. Roch. It may teach you perhaps, to be as much on your guard with English-men in future, as with... the Marquise de Vaudreuil \u2014 for example. Duch.

Duke Inscribe a sixth on the list, messire to complete the half dozen. Roch. (laughing) Your excellence, has overheard my little aparte. It must have agreably tickled your diplomatic ears, But by the way, what did you hint, apropos of it? Duke A doleful truth, messire. It is deplorable, after thirty years of diplomacy, to be compelled to seek counsel from your cap and bells in a case, precisely of their competence. Roch. I place then entirely at the disposal of your excellency. Duke I take you at your word. How is an old stager, some what of my guise, whose head har, been turned, by a flash of lightning, from the eyes of a certain aristocratic Armida the devil has shot across his path, on the verge of the fifties, \u2014 to induce her to marry him, however much against the grain?"], [83, "73 Roch.

It is clear, thai when perdition in the company of any number of young madcaps would be preferred to salvation under the guardianship of an austere grey beard, the enterprise is ha zardous. Duke Who nothing risks, nothing gains. Roch. Bravo! With the adroit, and daring, I sympathise. Duke You do not deem the case desperate then? Roch. Nothing is desperate save death; and even that is du- bious. Who knows but the dead may return, or live elsewhere? Duke I go ahead then, for the great stake. Roch. The worst is, that the experiment having been made already, the victim may object to repeat it. Duke Nevertheless, a ducal coronet, set in millions?... Roch. First rate lhat receipt, in general; But when riches are a drug?... Duke They lose their prestige, conceivably. Still when fish ing in troubled waters, there are always chances for an old hand. Roch. But unless proof against all the Circean arts of the sex, success might prove more damaging than defeat. Duke The Circes I defy, since when I have securely established my circumvallations, the most recalcitrant garrison can be compelled to surrender at discretion. For I am a man of the old stock.with clear brains, an inflexible will, and well braced muscles, none the worse for wear yet. Neither am I easily dis couraged, when I have set my heart on any thing.

Buck, [pretending to cogitate] Could one but allege some right... Char, [impatiently] Odds fish, when there is none... Buck. Then sire, unless you interpose your royal will. Char, [irritated] One would think I had an arny at my back, a budget on a par, and subjects of exemplary loyalty crowning the whole. \u2014 Not to speak of the subvention.... Buck, [muttering half between his teeth] True, a subsidized king. Char, [wrathfully] God damn me, if one would not think that you had sworn to exasperate me \u2014 Ah! Rochester would already have got me out of this scrape. You are deteriorating sadly George!"], [91, "81 Buck. I am reflecting sire. \u2014 If one could raise a question of nationality? Char. You cannot change her baptismal register, I fancy. Buck. No, but a new marriage certificate would do as well. Char, (eagerly] True! an English husband, and she ceases to be a French subject. But where to find him, thus on the nail? For a commoner she would reject, and a husband who might pre~ sume to be one, /should veto. Quick! fish me out this model spouse, predestined, and resigned. Buck. But sire, we have onlv twenty four hours at our dis posal. And the Marquise is so beautiful no one could be trusted, unless madly in love with some one else \u2014 moreover.nothing shor1 of some imperious personal motive held in terrorem over him could induce a man of birth to play so humiliating a part. How then find all these indispensable conditions at a moment's notice. Char, [striking his forehead] Eureka! I have found the very one required, and under our hands too. Buck, [pretending incredulity] Your majesty is pleased to mock me. Char, [triumphantly] And lord Ardown, then, what say you to him? Buck, Ah sire! your ready wit is never at fault. True, he combines all. But he is so proud; what could make him consent, short of a seas fold... and for a duel ! an English peer !... unless indeed the satisfaction might tempt him of taking such immediate vengeance on that girl, to whom, in his frantic passion, it appears, that he promised marriage. Char, [exulting] The very thing. He would not be an Os mond if he were not as vindictive as an aspic. And as for hold ing him in terrorem, is not his father steeped up to his ears in trea sonable cabals, to put that orthodox catholic brother of mine"], [92, "82 in my place.

Let no one say virtue is not recompensed. To my signal good nature, in leaving that old fool's head upon his shoulders, I owe the notable use it will be of to me now The father's head, or the son's hand. ..I stick to that; and confiscation to boot. Buck, [laughing] At that rate you may perhaps decide him, sire. Char, [jubilant] Moreover, it will enable me to kill two birds with one stone; inasmuch as, he might go, post haste, to marry his cousin, in his Celtic rancour against that Juliet; which would play the deuce with me; as I engaged my word to the Marquise to prevent that marriage, without having the remotest notion how to keep it. Buck. Sire you would sell us all. But how did that backstair's gossip reach your ears. Char. As they are always trying to catch Louise tripping, an imprudent escapade of hers, to Spring Gardens, was made a handle of, lo prove she had a 9ecret intrigue with this Ardown, and had followed him there through jealousy; whereas it was me she suspected of coming after that pretty French girl. She is so rabidly jealous of me. But enough. I go at once to put the knife to Ardown's throat. You meanwhile, see after the Marquise; and persuade her to make no futile objections to the clever plan which can alone meet the emergency, [exit Charles] Buck, (alone) I flatter myself I am blossoming into a first rato diplomatist. To retain the Marquise in England is the pri mary necessity. Fi r once carried back to France she would be"], [93, "83 lost to us all. And though forced to push forward a rival I would rather despatch to the nether regions; as his character and an tecedents will compel Charles to maintains him in the capacity of king log, hewill have no cause to thank me for assigning to him the part of Tantalus. Thus I take a thorn out of ny foot, while preparing for myself a stepping stone, entitling me to become the future consoler; unless the female heart has ceased to have any gratitude. Last, not least, I pay the duchess in her own coin, by wounding her in her most sensitive spots, while there is no humiliation in following on the track of a king. Mar. (coming to herself and looking around) You are alone, \u2014 at what conclusion have you arrived? Buck. At a first rate stratagem. Mar. Of your coining? Buck, (laughing) Don't even hint it, for Charles. Mar. (laughing) Believes it is his ! What an admira ble courtier you are Buck. Come \u2014 let us understand each other Your blood- thirsty ingrate still thrones it on his pedestal? Mar. Without doubt. Had there but been a fence between us, I should have gone into exstacies at coutemplating him in that new light. He was superb; He reminded me of a Roland. or a Coeur de lion. Buck. How truly feminine \u2014 In that case, to marry him will not prove objectionable. Mar. Stop A tete a tSte with my beloved would be slightly hazardous, \u2014 for the moment. Buck. That is not included in the programme. Mar. How then? Buck. Well, Charles being in a quandary to hunt up for you, instanler, a husband who would naturalize you English, without"], [94, "84 revendicating the honours of his charge; Ardown chancing to be at hand, :nd moreover, reassuringly in love with a certain Ju liet Mar. (laughing outright) His majesty found nothing better than to select him for his man of straw. \u2014 That was a happy hit. Buck. Oh ! you know monarchs, like husbands, are bound to be professionally hoodwinked. Mar. One essential however you overlook \u2014 Ardown's con sent. In his present humour, be would sooner lay his head on the block. Buck. You are mistaken. Jealousy maddens him far more than wrath. That you should return to France, to reign there as the queen of the royal hareem, renders him frantic. To pre veni your falling into the arms of Louis, or Charles, or of any one save himself, he would plunge into the bottomless abyss with you, or sell his soul to the arch fiend. Mar.

I object to trusting myself to his tender mercies, for the present- Buck. That forms no part of Charles' programme. Mar. You are worth your weight in gold, duke. When I have tamed and fettered my British lion. I shall have a medal struck, in your honour. Ruck, (laughing) On those terms, I fear I shall play the Pa ladin till the end of the chapter. (Enter Charles) Ruck. Madame has yielded to reason sire, though much a gainst her inclination. Char. That is well, for I have arranged every thing. Lord Ardown is ready; my confidential secretary will accompany the"], [95, "84 Marquise; his catholic almoner will celebrate the marriage immediately; and in a quarter of an hour, the countess of Ardown will be a Rritish subject, safe from all foreign jurisdiction.

It was not more difficult than that? Char. Eh! don't fancy it was all smooth water. In the first place, I was so confoundedly at a loss how to broach the matter, that at last I plunged headlong in to it, without any circumlocu tion. Ruck. Of course, the earl was indignant; foamed, stormed; \u2014 swore he would die a thousand-fold sooner Char. You are altogether mistaken. He merely drew him self up, with his grand patric'an haughtiness, fixed his eyes full on me, with a glance that struck me as slightly sardonic; and between, ourselves, he pretty nearly interchanged our roles, I was so deucedly nonplussed by his imperturbable self posses sion. Ruck, (laughing) I fully realize the situation. Char. Luckily howerer he resumed the whole, by saying.that although he could not have acceded to the proposal, under other circumstances, as it tallied with certain aims of his own, for the moment, he was willing to accept it. Ruck. Your majesty guessed light, as to his vindictiveness; but his consent being the essential, his motives are unimportant. Char. Odds fish ! he got off cheap; after obtaining the full pardon of the Marquis, forall his past and present misdemea nors \u2014 not to speak of his own. Ruck.

Char, [impatient] If you only come to pick a quarrel with me, I warn you the moment is inopportune. Duch. [plaintively] What a reception. A new face, a ca price, yet unsatiated, and all is effaced. Devotion, sacrifices, vows, felicity, raptures participated, [she feigns to weep] Never theless, I was confidently assured that de Barillon, no later than tomorrow, was to reconduct this intriguante to France.

Who is unacquainted with the erotico-"], [97, "86 political adventures of this unfaithful mistress of Louis; whose return he insists upon, so much to the mortification of her British admirers. Char, [piqued] You are altogether misinformed. She is not the mistress of Louis; and she will not return to France to mor row; because she remains definitively in England. Duch. [furious] Ah ! it is you then, sire, before whom this calumniated saint, lowers her flag ? Char, [ironically] Since lam just having her married;... Duch. [amazed] Married ! Char, [looking at his watch] By this time, she must be le gally, and legitimately, countess of Ardown. Duch. [uttering a half scream] Ah ! what on earth can have made you lend a hand to their loves ! Char, [struck of a heap] What mean you by that ? Duch. [sarcastically] Simply, that they are passionately in love with each other, and that you have played into the Mar quise's hands. Char, [incredulous] Bah ! Ardown, who has lost his head for that Juliett. Duch. [raging] Why, you unlucky dupe, she is Juliet, and you... you... have allowed youself to be hoodwinked, as usual...

There is a mystery under this, 1 shall take care to fa thom; and rest assured, that I shall deal out strict justice to whoever dares deceive me. Duch. [disconcerted] Ah sire, what an absurd notion Char. Enough, I begin to see clearer; and you will find it difficult to throw dust in my eyes, once I have opened them. Batyour turn will come. For the moment, I must look to what is more urgent, and more interesting. [ He goes to door, and. meets his secretary on threshold ] The devil ! I am too late. Secretary. Sire, Lord Ardown refuses absolutely to obey your majesty's orders, and insists on taking the countess with him; against her will. Char, (furious ] To hell with him. Let lord Ardown be sent to the Tower, under a charge of high treason. [He rushes out.] Duch. [alone] Heavens ! what have I done ! Ardown be hanged ! How could I be such a fool as to compromise my self thus, for him. I am ruined, if I do not turn aside Charles suspicions bv a master stroke. With his Stuart obstinacy, he will never give in. I must burn my ships; and risk all for all. [exit] (Charles and Buckingham reenter by the large door.) Char. Please explain to me why the devil you have play ed me this impudent trick. For I know all now. \u2014 This then is the cause why that artful beauty was so deeply interested in her brother's loves. For this too, Ardown was slashing at yvu with such right good will, when, in the nick of time, I preven-"], [99, "88 ted your cutting each other's throats. But what would baffle the Sphynx to unriddle, is to divine, what possible motive you can have had, to make me hold the candle to them both. Buck. Sire ! my excuse is, necessity. The capital point was to prevent the marquise being amenable to French law. There was but one way to achieve this, and but one man at, hand who could serve the purpose. Had I told the truth, jealousy would have overmastered reason, and all been lost. I knew that your majesty could keep lord Ardown out of the way, till better arrangements could be more leisurely made. More- over, his previous love affair with the marquise, sufficed, by simply antedating their clandestine marriage, to exonerate your majesty from having got it up suddenly, for the express purpose of baulking Louis of his rights, which he would have resented to an extent, greatly to be deprecated. For all these cogent reasons, it was essential not to let the truth transpire till the ceremony was an accomplished fact. Hence I braved your majesty's direst wrath, in order to achieve the desired result in the least compromising manner \u2014 Would I otherwise have put forward a rival, so bent upon annihilating me. For although my amourette with the marquise, was of the most ano dyne description; I owed him a serious grudge for taking it so tragically. Char. Se non e vero t ben trovato. For your disculpation is certainly plausible, and your arguments are convincing. But whether amour, or amourette, be at the bottom of your rela tions with the marquise, henceforth, all personal intercourse be tween you, is under my formal interdiction. Beware then of all contraventions; which I would visit with condign chastizement. Buck. Sire, your will is my law.

Marq. [jestingly] To whom? for all my professed victims are, to the best of my knowledge; as blooming as roses, and as gay as larks. Am I then called upon; to exclude the sole rays of sunshine which brighten, for me, the gloom of this British limbo. It is but thanks to his majesty and you, that the mushrooms do not grow in my saloons; and if I have not run to seed, in these last few weeks, it is because both he and you, are unenglish enough to be amusing.

But no sooner had I discovered that no insupera ble barrier divided us, than giving full vent to the sentiments you inspired me. they have absorbed my whole being, till life would be unendurable to me now, without you.

To treat me to such a dirge, is hardly taking the best means to cheer my forced seclusion, like the devoted troubadour you swore to be. Buck. The reason is, that the situation is becoming daily more urgent. Confiding in the ingenious arts of a refined co quetry, you think to hold your most contumacious aspirants in a leash, and to rule even kings by that fairy's wand where with you subjugated all the gallants of Versailles.

It is now but a question of days. The confidential messenger he sent, lest the Nuntio should trip him up, has delivered his autograph letter to the Pope, and writes that his holiness has only deman ded a brief delay for deliberation, to conform to established rules. You do not flatter yourself that the Pope will deny so trifling a favour, to a British monarch, who demands it on the most specious pretexts. Marq. Clement the seventh refused it to Henry the eighth, who was vastly more redoubtable than Charles. Buck. The two cases are totally dissimilar. Yours, consists of a clandestine contract; lacking all customary formalities and guarantees. Moreover, not having been consummated subse quently, it exists solely as an empty ceremony. Besides, the ve ry example you cite, has taught the Vatican what it costs, to thwart an English monarch.

Besides, my faithful servant, Chiffinch, will ac company you, to keep watch on him, and be at your orders. Marq.

I repeat, Madame, that it is only in the eyes of the two it is designed to blind; that you will be compromised. Marq. That is already too much. Char. In extreme cases, some sacrifices are indispensable. Louis will be undeceived later. There is no help for it, any how.

Wholly frantic would be nearer the mark \u2014 but since I was only playing a part ! Jen. Madame probably played it too well. One cannot but take in earnest what comes so naturally to the performer. Marq. [ exasperated ] All the better. I too am glad to be rid of the yoke. Jen. Woe is me ! where madame beholds the sun rise, I see the storm lowering. Marq. [impatiently] Again your romantic chimeras ! How English you are still, with your owlish forebodings. Jen. If I ventured to retort, I should say that Madame remains hazardously Parisian, in England. Marq. [proud/y] In England as in France I know how to maintain my dignity, and to retaliate on those who fail to respect it.

How do you fail to see that this flight is a scheme, to put you utterly in Charles power, while compelling you to silence in self defence; and flinging on Rochester's shoulders the entire responsability of the facts, and consequences.

Certes Madame, you are exceptionally skilled in the art of evasion and cajolery. But it is time that you should cease to delude yourself purposely.

She has even concerted with me, a certain plan which would obviate all danger. Marq. Oh! what gratitude I should owe you.

For the rest, it is only a question of accepting the hand and name of a man of such high quality and position as to be able to take you bac): to France triumphantly, so as to protect you effi caciously, even against the aggravated passion of the \"grand monarque\". Marq. [vexed] What! marriage again 1 can no one hit on any other means. Duke. The reason is, simply, that none other can be found. French, you depend on the arbitrium of France's despotic sovereign.

The simplest possible. The occasion offer-: of ren deiing a signal service to the daughter of my sovereign. And at the same time, fulfilling a desire of my own. There was no hesitation possible.

But were you in love with me, \u2014 which you must excuse my deeming, pro-"], [123, "112 blematic, \u2014 my heart not partaking this sudden whim, I could not accept the honour you do me. Duke, [smiling stiffly] It would appear that I have not ren dered myself intelligible, for there is no question of love, on either side. Marq. But if so ? Duke. Surely madame, you have not now to learn that such a consideration is never taken into calculation in the alliances of persons of our caste. \u2014 May I count on your indulgence, if I venture to speak unreservedly, frankness being imperatively demanded by the circumstances. Marq. Assuredly. Duke. Permit me then, on your side, to point out to you, that ultimately, matrimony will prove to you an unavoidable necessity. No woman of such remarkable beauty and distinc- tion can long dispense with the protection of a husband. Fai- ling this, 6he must inevitably be exposed to the pretentions, the snares, and the audacity of the most daring and unscru- pulous gallants of high life, as you have already experienced. I admit, that to the exceptional few, whose social life is a continual apotheosis, matrimony, under normal conditions, has serious drawbacks. Maternity, jealousy, are decidedly, objec- tionable adjuncts. But where these are eliminated, it becomes all benefit and no loss, to be sheltered by a consort, whose quality, and character are such, as to intimidate, and bid de- fiance to the loftiest of pretenders. \u2014 Such are the inducements on your side. \u2014 Upon mine, I must inform you that I have long nourished the ambition of having a wider scope for my acknowledged diplomatic capacity, than can be offered to it by any but that central pivot of European politics, France. My sovereign, who has nothing to refuse me, would long since"], [124, "i X 113 x have gratified, me in this, could I have fulfilled one condition he holds to be indispensable; namely, to have been accompa nied by ! a wife, fulfilling all the requirements of so high a position; susceptible of exercising that feminine influence, so omnipotent in court circles; and so matchless a factor in mak ing a princely establishment, the rendezvous of the dike of the court and the capital. Hence, his majesty invariably re plies to me, \u2014 marry, my good friend; marry, and you will be accredited lo France next day. The deuce ! an ambassador at Versailles; without an adroit and fascinating wife, can be but a limping diplomatist, shorn of all his prestige, and half his resources. \u2014 This is true. But marrying is easier said than done, in my case. For / have as little inclination for the shackles and obligations of marriage, as even madame la Marquise herself. Besides, I have certain private ties I cannot bring myself to break. The situation, therefore, was, in the highest degree embarassing. I required a wife who could con tent herself with only being so in public; while it was indi spensable that she should cumulate, with this abnegation, the highest lineage, youth, beauty, and esprit; to a degree ena bling her to surpass; or at least to equal, all rivals. How then was I to discover such a rara avis, and to make such stipula tions beforehand; or to enforce them subsequently, without an esclandre. \u2014 I had well nigh arrived at the conclusion that the case was desperate. Marq. [laughing] In effect Duke. Then, when the queen, in this dilemma, wrote to implore me to find you a husband at a moment's notice, and with a woman's ready wit, hitting the right nail on the head, suggested that here was the occasion I had so long sought in vain, and that neither of us would ever again meet with"], [125, "114 what suited us both so admirably, I saw at once that her ma jesty was right;\u2014 and being a man of rapid decision, and not having a momen; to lose; without an instant's hesitation I came to place myself at your orders. Marq. (greatly agitated] This is indeed strange. So stran ge, that I can scarcely bring myself to believa it serious.

But you are aware that now, there is absolutely no time to debate or to demur. In an hour, or thereabouts, all will be too late. You are no longer Countess of Ardown, and unless you prefer Buckingham; who only awaits my departure to open to you his platonic arms; when Lord Rochester arri ves, you will have no alternative but to chuse between Charles, and Louis. Marq. [amazed] How know you all this ? Duke. Madame, at court, walls have ears. I should be but a sorry diplomatist if any incidents at all interesting could take place amidst them of which I remained ignorant. \u2014 But to re turn to what is more important. Can you refuse to admit that it would be wiser, and more dignified not to pla\u00ab oneself in so humiliating a predicament, rather than to impose oneself on all deferences, and to silencs all audacities, by becoming, at"], [126, "X iiS X once, the duchess of Medinamoro, ambassadress of Spain, in France.

Marq. [disdainfully] Oh ! as for that, I am fully resolved to keep clear of the passions of others. To find my amuse ment in them, perhaps; but to be their dupe, or their victim, never more. Duke This is all that is requisite. Does it not strike you that a more dazzling retaliation on all those who insulted and mis judged you, could not possibly fall within your reach. And if so, nothing is wanting but to put it in execution, which will soon be done, if you but accept my arm, and let me lead you to the chapel below, where my almoner, whom I brought with me, awaits us, accompanied by the two requisite witnesses.

So,\u2014 you dared to think I was a man to let myself be toyed with, and mocked, like the rest; to let you sport with my heart, till you tore it up by the roots, and trampled it under foot; a feat only your unparalleled ability could have achieved.

Yet it was in vain that I studied you. In every flash of your limpid glance, I distinguished candour and self-respect; in every sentiment you expressed; nobility and refinement. Even in those burning moments, which in the chastest souls elicit the most impassioned emotions, I discerned a purity and dignity, which would have impressed even the most unscrupulous of roue's with respect. \u2014 What demon urged you to play this hy pocrite's part ? Why not have contented yourself with appear ing to me, as you ,' re; lovely, witty, graceful; corrupt, \u2014 and charming enough to indulge all your most capricious fancies; like another Ninon.

Marq. Of vengeance! I recognise you there too. Ard. [proudly] To which I was entitled Marq. But what, if things had turned out otherwise; or had not gone so smoothly ? Ard. My resolution was fixed. If I succeeded in carrying you away, either by your consent, or by force; all was pre pared to take you to Italy, where cloistered under the severe discipline of a rigid religious order, during your lifetime, you would have expiated your sins, and purified both body and soul; or if your defenders had been able to prevent it, I would have plunged my dagger into your heart, without a moment's hesitation. Marq. And you? Ard.

In the first case, I had therefore deter mined to become a monk, or an anchorite, in some cenoby or hermitage, within view of your cell, and there, to spend the remainder of my desolate existence, praying for you, and for our reunion in a less miserable world.

But when I snail have sobered you down to that reserve, demureness, and submission, which are the first duties of a woman, and a wife, you will thank me on your knees, for the generous pardon with which I consent to condone to day, the daring violation of all its most imperative obbliga tions, with which you have not feared to inaugurate your con jugal life."], [142, "131 Marq.

[turning on him, proud and indignant] Decidedly you are mad. Are you ignorant of what is capable such a woman as I,... when driven to extremities. You will curse the hour when you first set eyes on me. Were I compelled to make such a fracas as will resound from one end of Europe to the other. Marq. [sneering] I admire the frankness of your avowals, madame; but in order to put them in practise, you would find it necessary to obtain my sanction to them. Marq. Oh ! in Paris; amidst my own friends, and compa triots, I shall be fully able to dispense with your leave. Duke, [sardonically] In Paris, or Versailles, that might be possible; perhaps; \u2014 but in my suzerain fief in Aragon; whither I am about to convey you; if you succeed in issuing from the castle; or in letting any one penetrate within it, otherwise, than by my consent; I will give you carte blanche."], [150, "XI39X Marq. [dismayed] Holy virgin ! then I am lost ! [she totters as if about to faint. \u2014 The duke sustains her with one arm; and keeps the other hand on the hilt of his sword.] Charl. [marching towards him furious] Leave Madame at liberty, this instant /, the king, command it. Duke, [retreating a step or two] To me! It is clear that your majesty is no longer able to measure your words. Charl. [frantic, draws his sword] A la rescousse ! iny fol lowers ! (Buckingam and Rochester draw, also) Duke, (calm and haughty] Three against one ! That is too much, by two. \u2014 Your majesty exaggerates the privileges of ro yalty. Charl. [infuriated, seems about to rush at him. Buckingham throws himself before him.] Buck. Ah sire ! bethink yourself ! An ambassador ! Charl. [recoils furious and irresolute] Is an ambassador qua lified to set my royal will at defiance, and to brave me thus, to my face. Duke. Sire; nothing is farther from my intention. I am merely revendicating my own rights; not endeavouring to trench on your majesty's prerogatives. I ask no better than to withdraw my obnoxious presence, instantly; if your majesty will but permit me to depart. Charl. You need but to leave madame here; and all the gates and ports of my kingdom, will be thrown open to you. Duke. That is a clause, your majesty, to which 1 cannot submit.- On cooler reflection, I trust its impossibility, will exone rate, my refusal to give in to it.

You shall not carry"], [151, "140 madame, away, by force; were I compelled to tear her from you, at the point of my sword. Duke, [ceremoniously, but stern] Your majesty would think twice, before attempting such an unexampled proceeding. Be sides which, I too, have a sword I am not unused to wield, in more serious conflicts than this; wherein, nothing but imperious necessity, could induce me to cross its blade with your majes ty's to defend myself or my wife. Charl. [maddened, but not daring to attack him. To Buckingham and Rochester, with anguish and wrath.] What are you two doing there; passive and motionless, as stocks or stones; do not you comprehend that /, the king, am disarmed. (Buckingham and Rochester lower the points of their swords, and draw back.) Buck, [haughtily] To attack an ambassador, in the exer cise of his functions, on British soil ! \u2014 a personage, sacred under every regime; and in every country. Ah sire ! it is not from a man of my quality, that any monarch may demand such a service as that. Roches, [sardonically] To outrage the Spanish nation, in the person of its representative, in order to be made the ex piatory victim on whose shoulders are to be shifted, hereafter, the entire score of royal delinquencies; and to be vented, the concentrated furors of Philip, and Louis, combined; for this, sire, I should require to be a trifle more inexperienced. Duke, [to Marquise] Come, Madame ! the debate is closed, You must perceive it, by the attitude of your defenders. Re sign yourself then to your destiny, since the die is cast. Marq. [desperate] Do not hope it. I love Ardown; I adore him. I will never appertain to any but him. Living, I shall never be yours. \u2014 Ah ! if Ardown were here, he would deliver me-"], [152, "X I4i X Duke. He might get himself killed madame, he could do no more Marq. If so, I could die with Kim; that would be better A than to live with you. Duke, [drags her away with him to the door.] Marq. [screams to the king] Ah sire ! is it all over then? have you the heart to abandon me to my miserable fate ? Charl. [maddened] Abandon you, do not dream it. If need ful I will oppose force to force. (He claps his hands, and calls) Hallo ! my guards. (Seven or 8 men at arms enter, \"and range themselves behind the king and his friends.) Duke, [clashes his sword, and shouts] A 'mi, Espana ! (From twenty-five lo thirty Spanish men at arms enter, and range themselves in a semircicle around the duke, and the Marquise, \u2014 they enter by one of the side doors.) Charl. [bitterly] It appears that your excellency was'pre pared against any emergency. But to surround oneself with a body-guard of arm ,d retainers, in order to intimidate a mo narch, on the steps of his throne, is assuredly an unheard of innovation on th . rules of the diplomatic code. Duke. Sire ! the case of legitimate self-defence is admitted, or implied, in all codes whatsoever. Far from assailing, I seek but to retreat; and it is your majesty alone who detains me. Charl. [determined] Not so, \u2014 release Madame, \u2014 and all is said. If not, fear the worst. Duke, [makes a sign lo his sergevnt at arms, who carries the Spanish flag rolled up. The standard bearer advances, and unfurls the flag over the heads of the duke and the Marquise, whom he still grasps by the arm.] Duke.

[franticly ] Ah ! who will rid me of this pitiless tyrant, -Who shelters himself behind his flag, to tear out my heart, and to insult my crown ! (The secret door in the panelling is burst open, and Ardown rushes in, with his drawn sword in hand; half a dozen armed lac queys, are seen behind him, crowding the corridor.) Ard. [replying to Charles] L sire, (general surprise. Duke anticipating something unforeseen, stands on his guard, and holds the Marquise, who tries to break from him.) Marq. [to Ardown] Ah ! Thank God ! you will know how to rescue me; and if needs be; to kill me, rather than to deliver, me into these abhorred hands. Ard. Did you doubt it for an instant. Had I not known what to do, would I have left you in them, [to the duke.] Come monseigneur, let madame free, without any farther demurring. If you wish to be spared the humiliaton of being forced to do So. Duke, [sternly] Who can compel me to surrender my wife under the guardianship of the banner of all the S pains; and of my sword. Ard. I, \u2014 who would trample under foot all the banners on the earth, when they are abused, to shelter delinquencies which the laws of God condemn, and those of man, chastize.

[lo Buckingham] Your grace has saved my life. Bucking. In such a contingency, mylord, you would have done the same. (Meanwhile, Char/es and his group come forward, separating Ardown, and the Marquise, from the duke.) Duke, (menacing, but uneasy.] You will pay dear this unex ampled outrage, mylord. For unless you can prove it to be a delinquency, for a husband to revendicate the possession of his legitimately wedded wife; you will not be able to justify it before any tribunal, at home or abroad. Ar,l. [haughtily] Your wife ! It is mine, whom you are pleased to qualify bv this usurped title; in order to mask an abduction by violence, which his eminence, the cardinal arch bishop of Toledo, would be as far from sanctioning, as the holy See; and his majesty, Philip the fourth, would be as little dis posed to shelter with his flag, as is his majesty Charles the second. Charl. (astounded] What say you, mylord ? Ard. That madame is my wife. Ry my halidom ! Sire you ought to know something of it; since it was your majesty who was pleased to get us married. Unless indeed, the law has been abrogated in the interim, which decrees, that in the case of two marriages, during the life-time of both parties, only the first is legally, and religiously valid."], [155, "X 144 X Charl. [more and more confounded] But what of the papal Bull, annulling the previous marriage. \u2014 Ard. Sire, your majesty has been shamefully deceived. Charl. [agitated, he orders his men at arms away, with a sign] We need no prying ears, in this debate \u2014 speak mylord. Duke, [motions to his men to withdraw \u2014 exeunt all subordinate personages.] Ard. Sire, the Bull in question never emanated from the Vatican. Charl. Is this possible ! But no, the signature, the great seal; all was in regular order. Would to heaven, mylord, that you were right; but you must be mistaken. Ard. Sire, would I presume to affirm it positively, were it not a certainty. \u2014 Informed of the fact, anonymously, I hastened to the Nuncio's, and heard from his eminence's lips that the Bull can only be a forgery, admirably imitated; in proof thereof, here is an autograph letter of his Holyness, the Nuncio was enjoined to remit to my own hands; through which your ma jesty can convince yourself, [he hands the large envelope to Charles.] Charl. [seizing it and reading] My dear son in J. C. You are alarmed without cause. No reclamation has reached us concerning your marriage. If any such idea was ever entertain ed, on second thoughts, it has been deemed better to spare us the exceeding regret of being compelled to refuse the sole favour ever requested of us by a sovereign for whom I feel the warmest sympathy; \u2014 the marriage ties, being too sacred to be severed, even by the apostolic power, unless for moti ves far graver than those which, it appears, could alone have been pleaded in this case... etc. etc. Charl.

None but a woman could have pushed audacity so far. Duchess of Portsmouth enters, [all in black, with a deep veil throivn over her.] Duch. [flinging herself at feet of Charles .] Yes, sire; I avow my crime; Prepared to accept humbly its chastizement at the hands of my beloved sovereign. I sought to spare your ma jesty a hasty proceeding which must inevitably have been the source of graVe cotnplic ations abroad, and injurious ones at home. \u2014 Your majesty is now ; ble to judge how the results would have differed from what was purposed. I sought likewise, in preserving to lord Ardown his conjugal rights, to silence de finitively the calumnious rumours which unscrupulous scandal mongers have not even been deterred from tracing up to the throne. \u2014 Compelled to act with unhesitating promptitude, I had not the choice of means. Besides, the heart cannot reason coolly. Your majesty knows that. \u2014 It is for you sire, therefore, either to condemn, or to absolve me; if in your sovereign cle mency, the profound attachment which impelled me; \u2014 the loy alty of my intentions; \u2014 and their results\u2014 can attenuate my culpability in your eyes. Charl. (gravely] Rise, madame. We shall advise you of our decision late . taking into due consideration the sincerity of your avowals.. Duch. Never Sire, \u2014 until your majesty grants me a magna nimous pardon; for now that I am able to weigh all the gra vity of my offence, I cannot sufficiently humiliate my elf at your feet, [she buries her face in her hands and sobs.] Charl.

[mocking, to duke] Checkmated at the moment of triumph ! a dire humiliation for so consummate a diplomatist. Duke, [with eold rage] It is my turn now, to fling my gaunt let to lord Ardown, and to assure him that when my hour of retaliation arrives, I shall know how to find him, were it at the antipodes, [he flings his glove at lord Ardown' s feet.] Ard.

Charles (aside to Buckingham.) What is to be done, in this quandary. Buck. Faire bonne contenance a mauvais jeu. Reflect sire that you owe a huge cierge to lord Ardown. But for him, this bullying Spaniard had all the trumps in his hand. Whereas now, it is but a temporary discomfeilure. Ardown cannot long absent himself. His old father, his vast estates must soon recall him. I do not give the marquise six months, after the honeymoon, to pine with mortal ennui, at the perpetual tete a tete. Then' the passion cooled, the fetters will irk.

Why have left me in the dark, till too late. Besides, I had no other adequate means to dispel the suspicions of Charles, and to keep her out of my way, now and hereafter. Roch. You have certainly consigned her to an Othello, equal to prevent her backsliding. Never will he let her come to the surface again, till he has saddled her \"more anglice\" with a patriarcal progeny, that will convert her into an innocuous dowager, at the age when, in France, she would be at the apogee of her beauty, and her triumphs; with the prospect of throning it over three generations of adorers, like Diane de Poitiers. Duch. True! that will be condign retaliation. My rival will soon learn, to her cost, that to play at true love, with Britons; is the game, a qui gagne, perd. (*) (She approaches the king, Speaking to him aside.) What thinks my king. For whom beats every pulse of my constant heart ? Is it for the sovereign whose wrath I have braved, to preserve his love, or for his supposed rival, whom I have handed orer to the wife he adores ? Charl. (in an undertone] It must be admitted I was wrong- Even royalty may be so, occasionally.
