OORING backward over the brief bistory of tbe Stats of Colorado, tbs youngest and fair- est of our bright sisterhood, is like turning lhe leaves of soms grand romance that has charmed us in the past, and promises to renew the pleasure wben ws shall address ourselves answ to its pern- sal. lo write of such a wonder-land can only bs a labor of lovs for those to whom its rare beauties and eventful history have been revealed. Colorado is a poem, a picture, an embodiment ol romance. No fairy tale was ever told in which so many glad surprises entered as have marked like milestones the development of the Centennial Ste,te : but still the writer of its history must shrink dis- comfited from the full performance of his duty, discouraged by ths ineompstsncs of languags to du justice to the absorbing theme. and national enthusiasm have eomhined to fire the hearts and souls and tongues and pens of Colorado pilgrims until now the State is so well and favor ably Known that its history may be written with tbe eomfortablo assurance that it will fi\u201ed many rsadsrs, and perhaps friendly critics, svsn though its faults are thick :cs du\u00bbt in vacant chambers. It may be well enough, perhaps, to confess at the outset that this sketeb of the Stats is intended to be diseursive ratber than dryly statistieal, and, although faets and figures will enter into its com position, they are by no means likely to mar the pleasure of tbose opposed to tho Gradgrind sebool of social economists. Ihere is no laek, indeed, of interesting historical data, and the material inter ests of the State deserve more recognition than they are likely to reeeive here ; but there is no room for the long roll of pioneers more than tbere is for the almost endless list of paying mines, lbe most that can bo crowded into tbis contracted space will be a skeleton bistory, filled out with pictures of the physieal, social and butine\u00bb\u00ab aspects ot the , State. lbese may sound like grand words ; and tbe his toriau may bo aecused at the outset of a \"gush ing\" tendeney, better fitted to ths poet's eorner of a country newspaper than to such a work as this. Colorado has tbe reputation already of having inspired more \"gush\" than most of tbe older States. Dven New Dngland's roekhouud shores, wbere the Pilgrim Fathers foregathered iu the early days, has suffered by comparison with tbe heart and crown of tbs continent; and Pike's Peak is at least as well Known as Plymouth RoeK, bssids bsing mush more monumental. National pride Chance reference to the pioneers ol Colorado carries us baek to the days ol '59 and ths strng glss and triumphs ol the brave men and women who, twenty years ago, sat down bslors the mount ain walls to build a State, nnder cireumstances the most discouraging, lhs Israelitish host who"], [26, "18 HISfOR? OF COLORADO. yet eloquent records of a race of msn, now and for many long ages unknown to those who succeeded them. In the eliff-honses ol the Rio Glances in Southwestern Colorado, there lived onee a hall civilised people, probably descended lrom the ancient Arises, though possibly lorsmnnsrs or rivals ol that romantic race. Latsr still came the Mexicans, who once owned the eountry south ol tbe Arkansas River, and wbo are still counted an important element about eleetion times, soms thou sands of them remaining in the southern counties of the State, and as far north as Pusblo. Con temporaneous with the latter, and possibly witb ths formsr, wsrs ths various tribes of American Indians wbo roamed these then pathless wilds and fought and bled and stole ponies with the same untiring industry whieh marks tbeir descendants, aud makes tbem tbe special pets and proteges of the Indian Bureau of to-day. lbe annals of Old )Iexieo are silent as to wbetber or not tbere was a Mexican Indian Bureau in those days, but it is safe to assume, no doubt, that, if there was, tbe Indian supplies were stolen long before tbey reaebed these outposts of Spanish- American eivili xation. lbe testimony of history, however, is that the Indians and i>Iexieans eultivatsd ths Christian grace of dwelling together in harmony and peaee, and found tbe land broad enough for both races. wers lorcsd by tbsir masters to tbs task ol making bricks without straw, had far mors to eneourage tbsm than tbs sarly settlers of Colorado. lhe real utility of straw in the brick business has been doubled, bul lbere is no doubt that nine tenths of the men wbo saw Colorado in 1859, eon sidered it nearly, if not ouite, unfit for human bah station, lhe Great American Desert stretehed almost from the Hlissonri Rivsr to tbe Rocky Hloun tains, a rainless, treeless waste, aud the mountains tbemselves, however rieb in gold and silver, offered small inducements for men to build tbemselves homes therein, much less populous and enterpris ing eities, such as we see there now on every band. lhe grand passion of our '59ers was to get tbemselves rich, and concurrently to get tbemselves out of the country, lbousands of tbsm thought tbs first of loss eonsscpisnos than tbs seeond, and so made tbemselves scarce witbout waiting for fortune to shower ber gifts upon them, preferring the flesh-pots of \"America,\" as tbe Fast for many years was called, to Colorado's sunny but unsym pathetio aud lonely skies. No thought bad tbese, or, indeed, tbe others wbo remained, of tho glori oils future in stors lor ths incipient Stats, Bsau tiful scsnery, to be sure; but who could livs on scsnery ? A fins climate, too ; but that only aggra vated appetite, wben flour was worth K59 a saek. lhe man wbo turned bis oxen out to die in the fall of '59, and surprised himself in tbe spring by rounding them up in good condition, was probably the first one wbo looked upon Colorado with a view to permanent residence. He was tbe father of tbe stock business, and bis name ougbt to be banded down to future generations of cattle-grow ers as tbeir great original. Dvidently, the heritage of the soil was conoid ered of little worth by either the Indians or the )Iexicans, for the formsr sat up no barriers against Mexican invasion, and the latter thought so little of the eountry that immense tracts ol land were given away to almost any one who would take tbem. Old )Iexiean grants eover some ol ths best land in Southern Colorado. Although tbis expansive region was so new and strange and solitary to the settlers of twenty years ago, and although its bistory may propsrly date from ths last dseacie but ons, historical accuracy demands that msntion bs made of former races and tribes of men, who lived out tbeir little lives within these vsry limits wbsrs our prosperous State now stands. Colorado can show tbe mute lhe Spanish occupation of this conntry dates back to 1510\u201412, when Vasc^ueli Corouado led an expedition in this direetion, aud explored the land thoroughly, as he thought, for gold, finding nono.

He also diseovered the famous springs at tho foot of tbe mountain. From Coronado to Captain Pike ix a long leap; but history has not bridged the interval with any account of intermediate explorations. Pike dates baek only to the opening of the present century, 1896, when Colorado was a part and parcel of tbo Louisiana purchase, lhs Captain was sauntering over the State \u2014 of Louisiana \u2014 in the fall of the year, exploring tbe valleys of the Arkansas, when bix attention was attraeted by the famous mount ain whieh bears bis name. Fremont, ths Pathfinder, eame this way in 1843, and it was tbe report of his explorations wbieb first awakened publie interest in this territory. Although Fremont bore witness to the mineral eburaeter ol the conntry, he reported no actual discovery ol precious metals, nor did Pike. Pursley, the Ren tuckian, told Pike tbere was gold bere, but tbe latter attached little importance to the statement. Fremont's party parcel on to California, but next year returned by another route and explored North, .^fiddle and South Parks, and reported many inter esling observations, lhe mountains were full of game and moderately full of Indians, though nous of tbess early explorers appear to have been troubled by tbe aborigines. Gen . Fremont's reports regarding the eountry seem to have attracted no settlers bitberward save a few Preneb and bills breed fur-traders, who came West aud settled down to grow up with the Indians, )Iost of tbem mar ried one or more Indian wives, and becamc, ae< il were, eonneeting links between barbarism and eivili xation. lbe earliest settlers of Colorado found many of these rough-banded but warm-hearted people hers on tbsir arrival, and, indeed, many of them remain to this day. tbougb death is decimals ing tbeir ranks very rapidly. Pike appears to have been, if not an ignorant, at least a superficial observer. He was tbe first wbite Ameriean tourist who visited Hlanitou and its mag nificent surroundings, yet he never diseovered the famous springs or noted the monument ruekx in tbo Garden of the Gods. He did not svsn ascend tbs peak which hs took tbo liberty ol ebristening. In the account ol bis travels which he published iu 181(1, but which is now out ol print, may be lound the story ol bis attempt to scale tbe peak, an attempt which ended in ignominious failure. Like many another tenderfoot, be took the wrong direetion, and emerged on a mountain fifteen or more miles distant from tbo peak proper, lhe latter, according lo bis story, was twice as high as tho point on whieh he stood, and he thought it must be at least 18, 509 feet above the level of Louis iana proper. Among these notable men was a grandson of one of the signers of the Declaration of Indepen dence \u2014 Flbridge Gerry, of Connecticut, lbe pio user bore his grandfather's name, and never dishonored it by a mean or ignoble aet.

It has already been stated that discoveries ol gold were made in the mountains as early as dan nary ol this year, but the great excitement ol the season did nut begin until Nay, when Gregory Gulch was first prospeeted by the famous dobn H.

It seems singular, now that mining has been reduced to an exaet science in Colorado, us well as in older eountries, that so long a time sbould have elapsed, and so many grave errors should have been committed, before this most reasonable and certain result was attained.

It is true that the miners left ono loeality for another pretty often, leaving large and populous cities almost desolate and witbout inhabitant, bnt the people turned np in another part ol tbs State, very soon, and soon bad anotber city under way. lbough mining was always the principal industry ol Colorado, agriculture and stoek-growing Kept pass with mineral development, as will be seen by the sneeeeding chapters specially devoted to tbese industries. for Colorado was seeond to that of no man, not even that of his predecessor, Gov, Gilpin, had no souner laid down his offiee in 1865, than be began to agitate the question of railway con neetion between Denver and the world outside. lhe Dnion Paeifie Railroad was working its way westward, aud tbe Kansas Pacific was aiming at the mark whieh tbs Atehisun, lopeka A Suntu Fe road has sinee hit, but neither enterprise tben on loot looked to Denver eitber as a terminus or way station.

In point ol laet, the panic did not extend to Colo rado, lbere were no failures in the State worth speaking of. lhs banks stood firm. A consicl srahls shrinkags in rsal sstats was about ths only offset of the panie upon the population of Colo rado, bnt that only pinched a few luekless opera tors, who bought high and bud to sell low. It is true that a few men, wbo thought themselves mill ionaires, found that they were only worth half a million, yet their sufferings wers mors imaginary than real. On the otber hand, ths panie drove many aetive business men from the Fast to Colo rado, in the hops of rebuilding lost fortunes, and many of these new-eomers in 1874-75 are now among the most enterprising and successful opera tors in the State. It is the habit of some travelers to assert that Colorado eannot sustain a large population, because her agricultural resources are limited, lhe foree of this argument is hurd to discover. Nining dis tricts rarely embrace agricultural advantages too, and, in the Fast, it is not expected that a mining population shall supply itself with ths necessaries of life. So long as Colorado ean draw easily and cheuply upou Kansas and Nebraska for hor laek of grain and other agricultural products, there is no reason why she may not support u population equal to the Nsw Fngland average.

As time went on, and the country grew apace, these conditions changed rapidly lor ths better. Denver, and some ol the other cities, beeams comfortable places of residence, lhe cost of living was high, but a steady reduetion followed the opening of railway communication and tbe develpment of agriculture. In u short time, the trip to Colorado beeame a pleasure excursion, in stcad of a painful journey, aud then the invalid tourist uppeured ubove the horizon, and began bis career of usefulness in the State. Colorado has not an Italian climate, and the absurd claims to that effect have brought mucb contempt on tbose who make tbem. Sbe has extremes of heat and cold, lhe winters are marked by oeeasional storms of great severity. Dust is a nuisance to diseased lungs at all seasons, lhe summer sun would bo intolerably hot if not neutralized by the refreshing shade. And yet tbe \u00abl!e?-<iFe of tbe climate is all that eould be desired or expected. lhe climatic conditions of Colorado are, per haps, due entirely to the limited rainfall, tbougb altitude has a separate hearing upon tbe problem. Without entering upon any scientific, or even technical, consideration of tbe question, it is enough to say that the limited rainfall leaves the sky lree ol clouds about three bundred days out ol every year, and throughout these tbree bundred days, iu wintsr and in summer, the sun shines bright and warm. With so mueb sunshine, ol courss tbe evaporation ol moisture is perfect, lbe earth and air is dry. Nuiariu and tbe diseases incident thereto ure practically unknown, save at rare intervals, as the result ol defective artificial drainage, lhe air is not only dry, but full of ozione and electricity, aud the altitude reduees its pressure. In healthy lungs, it is invigorating and restorative, but the contrary effect is manifested in lungs too weak to accommodate themselves to the inereussd demand upon their capacity, the volume ol air inhaled in Colorado being eonsiderably greater than ut lower altitudes east or west. No reeord of the resources of Colorado would bo complete wbieb did not iueluds tbe invalid tourist, but, to the eredit of^ ths Stats, it must bs said, that sbs bus paid eent per eent, in sound health, for the thousands of dollars which invalids have poured into her extended palm.

Hundrsds and, perbaps, lbousands ol people are enjoying good health in Colorudo lo-duy who cams bore confirmed invalids, Nuny more, eoming too late, have died here, but, il the lair warning given by sueb deaths had been heeded in ths Fast, ths numbsr would not have increased so rapidly ol late years. No one in Colorudo, physician or lay- man, pretends to say that consumption, in its last stages, can be arrested, in tbis climate or in any otber climate, lhs eonlrary is lrne. It would he a miracle, indeed, il three-quarters or half a lung eould expand in this rurified utmosphere sufficiently to support life in a man or woman, with one foot already in tbe grave, and the other trembling on the brink. And not only ths dry and rurified air eontends against nature, in such instances, but elemental disturbances tend to snap tbe rotten threud of life. lhe influence of ultitude upon health has been notsd, not only by svsry medieul mun, but also by every intelligent observer. According to tho highest authorities of Colorado, the members ol the State Nedieal Society, tbe sensations attending a first entrance into this State are always pleasant to persons in good health, \"lbe dryness ol tbe atmosphere,\" says Dr. Fdmondson, ol Central, \"together witb tbe eleetricity tberein eontained, combined with perhaps otber peculiarities ol eli matH, excite the nervous system to u remark able degree ol tension, lhe physical functions"], [66, "50 HISlOBV OF COLOBADO. mental as well as physical conditions, but tbis task must be left to some one more eapable of elueidat- which, it may be for years past, have been aeeomplished in u sluggish, inefficient manner, at onee assume a vigor of action to which tbe system has heretofore been a stranger, lhe uppe tits is Keen, the digestion vigorous, and the sleep is sound and refreshing, lhe result of these manifold innovations on tho establisbed routine of the vital eeonomy is, that all those lurking ail ments to wbieb the civilized man is more subjeet than hs ougbt to bs ars swept at onee away, and whatever there is in eaeh individual of eapaeity to enjoy is ealled into tbe fullest uetion, Hs rsvsls in what might bs called an intoxication of good health.\" ing it. lbe early settlers lound ths seasons in Colorado at considerable variance with those in tbe sams latitude toward tbe east. A warm sun iu wintsr was ths first pseuliarity noted. Farth and ah were dry, und the dirset rays ol tbe sun were a reminder ol summer. It was lound, however, that however hot tbe sun shone in midwinter, svsn wbsn men went about out-door work in their shirt slssves, snow seldom melted in ths sunsbins, but a soft wind moving ueross the eountry wonld soon earry away on its invisible wings a heavy lali ol snow in a lew hours, leaving the ground not only bare but dry. Hence the winters wsrs generally pleasant, tbe exeeptions to tbis rule being oecu sions wben the wind blew cold or a northwest snow-storm swopt down upon ths plains, lbs snow-lall in Dsnvsr has nsvsr bssn excessive sinee tbe settlement of the town, but it has been ssvsrs at timss, generally between the middle of Decem ber and the first of February, lhs latter month and tbe first half of Nareb are usually pleasant.

Darly iu April, ths spring snows fall, soms timss to a grsat depth, and doing more damage to tbe stoek interests than any other elemental dis turbunee. When these snows disappear, usually a few days after their fall, grass and grain spring up and summer is at hand, exeept that foliage rs often delayed a month or more longer. With the foliage eome the rains, varying greatly in different seasons, but not increasing every year, as some ignorantly assert. lhe latter comparison is not inapt. Nothing is more common than for people to say that the air of Colorado invigorates them like new wine. In tbs vsry admirable sssay from whish the foregoing is quoted, Dr. Fdmondson goes on to say : \" Au unclouded mind partakes of tbe elasticity of a healthy body, and the unwonted vigor of man's intelleet is manifested by u newly aroused desire for aotivity and by an increased capability to accom plisb.\" Fvery brain-worker will attest the truth of this assertion, and nowhsrs in ths whols eountry are the profossions and all manner ol busi ness pursuits prosecuted witb so mueb vigor and success. It has been often said that men are improved mentally and socially as well as physieally by com ing to Colorado, lbere can be no doubt of this laet.

As tu tbe range of tbe thermometer, that errutie instrument sbould not be quoted officially in Colorado, until eorreeted fur altitude and new climatic cunditions.

A great point bad been gained, however, dy the discovery that vegetables flourished in the soil of tbe plains and mountains, lhe first potato erop paid an enormous profit, and next year many per suns engaged in the business, some of tbem only to meet with failure, though otbers succeeded be yond their wildest hope, Fxperiments were made with other vegetables, and ths sra ol big pump- Kins and giant squashes dates from that day. Another yeur established the fact that Colorado was witbin tbe limits of the great wbeut-belt of tbo eontinent, and, from tbut tims till now, whsut bus bssn and is tbs staple erop of Colorado farmers. In the early years of the country, wbeu scarcely anybody expected to stay here more than the few weeks or months neeessary to obtain a fortune from the mines, ugrieulturs was something not dreamt of in their philosophy, and no attempt was made to cultivate ths soil. As timo went on, aud one or two \"hurd winters\" cume, bringing exorbi taut prices fur pruduee ur cutting uff the supply entirely, the idsa us raising earn for horse-leed, alter ths Nexiean fashion, was originated by some one, and soon put into practical operation. It must not be understood, though, tbut becuuse Colorado raises the finest wheat, the best potatoes and tbe biggest squashes and pumpkins in the world, that ber agriculturists are clothed in pur pie and fins linsn, and fars sumptuously every day. On the contrary, lhey work harder and are less repaid proportionately than farmers anywhere else in ths country. A few rude and ' imperfect irrigating ditches wers eonstrueted, under whieh a lew acres were planted, eorn being the principal crop, alternating with an uecusional potato patch, lhe potatoes wers truly a happy thought, lor, whils ths eorn hardly paid lor its cultivation, tho potatoes yielded largely, and proved to bs ol superior quality. Such wus the small beginning ol agriculture iu Colorado, and it has advanced wonderfully sinee that time, especially in view ol the difheulties it has had to meet and overcome. In ths first plaee, the acquisition ol agricultural land in Colorado has lor many years involved a eonsiderable outlay ol money, and a poor man bus had small show tu engage in lurming. Wbile tbsrs urs milliuns ol aeres ol arable land iu tbe State, or land that would be uruhls il irrigated, there is not un unlimited supply ol water lor irri gation, and it is not a question ol land, but ol"], [72, "54 HISlOBV OF COLOBADO. water, witb the farmer, lo seeurs tbs latter, hs must expend more or less money, either in build ing a diteh, or buying a watsr-right from a ditch already constructed. In either case, bis water costs bim what would ho considered in the Fast a fair rental for the land. this may be a eoineidenee merely, the only proof substantiating the theory being tbe laet that the latest visitations followed tbs first in about that ordsr, ths beginning and ending having been marked by a eurious eorrespondenee ol dates, as well as ol characteristics. Having seeured both land and water, hs pro eeeds to make a crop. Wheat is sown very early in the spring, olten in February, whieh is usually a pleasant month in tbe Colorado climats ; il not, Nareb rarely fails to bring planting weatber. In April, tbsrs is always mors or less ligbt and warm snow, which melts rapidly and \"wets down\" the nsw-sown wheat, so that irrigation is unneeessarv at that season. Nay brings spring rains in greater or less abundance, witb warm, sunny days, that start the young wheat and early vegetables fairly on their way, and also begin to molt ths snow on tbs mountains, by wbieb ths streams ars fsd, tbs latter bsing low or entirely dry during the winter and early spring. By the time the streams are run ning full ol water, the work of irrigation must begin, and be Kept up till tbe crops are harvested. lhe amount of irrigation required depends largely upon the fall of rain for the summer season, and somewhat also upun tbe character of tbe soil, but it is safe to say that during tbe irrigation season the farmer will be ealled upon to work at least all day, and perhaps far into the night. lbs grasshopper problem has perplexed ths wisest \u00ab\u00ab\u00ab:\u00ab\u00bb\u00ab of two continents, and tho Colorado ranchman only Knows that they eome in countless numbers and depart, leaving bis fields as brown and bare as though tbey had never been planted.

No doubt tbere is foree in this argn ment, and the interest ok the people in the ques tion has been repeatedly evinced, not alone by memorials to Congress, bnt by eonvsntions to eon sider extsnsivs systems ol irrigation. Boulder Creek waters a fertile valley on its way across the plains, dotted by handsome farms ; but its greatest eharm is in ths mountains.

In 1873, an irrigation convention was held in Denver which was attended by the Governors ol several Western States and lern'tories, and by the leading agriculturists ol ths Stuts us wsll as dsls gates from Utah, where tbs same system prevails. Beyond an interebange ol views and the inevitable memorial to Congress, nothing eame ol this eon vention, but the address ol Hon. 8. H.

Probably during the deeade preceding the eventful year when the mines of Leadville began to yield up their hidden treasures, ths nst profit of mining ovsr and above ths sxpsnss inclined in its proseeution, was not mueb greater than the net profit ol tho stock business. On the plains of Colorado and Western Kansas, eattle succeeded the buffalo as naturally as wbite men sueeeeded tbe Indians. It eould not have besn any seeret to tbe early settlers that stoek would live and fatten on tbs nutritious grasses of the plains and mountains all the year round, for they saw buffalo, antelope, deer, elk and other gram niverous animals depending entirely for tbeir sus tenance upon the same, but in spite of this \" oeular proof,\" it appears to bs a faet, as already stated elsewhere, that the father of tbe stock business in Colorado turned bis cattle out iu tbe fall expecting them to dio during the winter, and was surprised to find tbsm fat and flourishing iu ths spring. Dvsn at this lats day, witb thousands of cattls roaming ths plains on svsry hand, wintsr and sum msr, soms stranger is always found willing to swear that they must inevitably starve to death in tbe winter, lbese doubting lhomases, impressed witb aneient heresies regarding the Great Amsriean Desert, are alike incapable of realizing that eattle can live on our grasses the year round aud that lhe finest wheat and vegetables in the world can bs produced from our soil. lbis is a startling statement, aud, unfortunately, or fortunately, as tbe ease may be, the figures are not at hand whereby it can be supported. It is equally impossible to say how mueb money was swallowed up in unlucky mining enterprises, and how mueb was made by raising stock wbile the business was comparatively new and tbe range not overcrowded us it is now in many directions. When cattle eould be brought to maturity and market at a eost of about 35 per head, and sold ut 339; 349, or even 359, it requires no arithmetician or \"ligbt ning ealeulator,\" or even Col, Sellers, to see that there were \" millions in it,\""], [82, "HISlOBV OF COLORADO. 60 purpose, lhe Indians have been supplied with fresh beef regularly sinee that time, and the herd has increased despite tbis constant drain upun it, till even the Government is likely to have \"beef to sell,\" besides what the Indians uss. lbese cattle are said to yield excellent beef ths year round, thougli Knowing no feed exeept the rich grass of the White River Valley. Dsnvsr's bsst bssf, not exempting tbs eorn-fed article, comes horn the Snake River eountry in Northwestern Colorado, and this Snake River beef is often on the market when the Plains cattls are too poor to Kill, However lightly Coloradoans may esteem the intelligence of these people, they do not much care to combat tbeir erroneous ideas by argument, and cattle-growers are especially indifferent on tho sub j eet. On the contrary, tbey do not eare how many peciple are deterred horn entering tbe business by fears of losing their investments. Wide as the range is, ths supply of water is limited in dry sea sons, and they do not want to be crowded by new comers out of tbeir eboseu localities, lbough the \" range \" is free to all, the water front is usually taken up by tbs boms ranches of cattls and shssp growers, wbo own tho land adjacent thereto and thereby control tbs range back of their respective claims. Flicroachmc'nts upon these vested rights ars rars, bnt if the country sbould become more crowded by a decided increase in the number of cattle-growers, trouble might ensue or tbe interests of tbe parties might he endangered in other respects. Nor is Southwestern Colorado ons whit behind ths Nortb in this particular, lbe Animas and otber valleys of the San duan country produce the finest beef as well as tbe best vegetables and other erops. lbere seems to be no doubt that tbe entire western slops of tbs Stats is a good stock eountry. It is with tbe east, bowever, particularly tbe great plains, that the pastoral interests of Colo rado aro principally identified. Ou tbess almost boundlsss prairiss, thousands upon thousands of borsss, cattls and sheep range tbrougbout, tbo year, and maintain themselves in generally good condition witbout any food save that prepared for them by tbe bountiful band of nature. Prior to the advent of railroads in Colorado, ths stock businsss was limitsd by ths boms dsmaucl and sucb Government contracts as could be secured for the supply of bssf to interior and neigh boring military posts. lho railroads, however, gave a great impetus to eaeh of these demands and also opened np u new trade, whieh has of late years exceeded the aggregate ok both the others eombined.

For several yeare<, the most available ground was worked over and witb returns that were generally satisfae tory. Up to tlie close of 1865, it was thought that over three millions were taken out. From that year, miners began gradually to abandon the country, and, in 1869, production had dropped to 369,999, and to 320,000 in 1 876.

As between tbe Utes and tbe Indian Bureau, the people ol Colorudo think there is not mucb room to oboose. A lew years ago, the writer was eondncting a daily newspaper in Denver, tbe poliey ol whieh was by no means lriendly to the Dtes; but, lor a time, its columns were devoted to the unpleasant task ol showing how Indian affairs were misman aged in Colorado, It was no sseret then that our people feared tbe worst results horn the state of affairs at the Nortbern Agency, lhey eould not have been mueb worse. All the supplies for tbe Wbite River Indians wers at Rawlings, wars housed at Government expense, awaiting trans portation, Notbing had been done toward getting tbe supplies from the railway to the Ageney, and nothing was done for many months, lbe Indians were simply destitute. lbey had neither pro visions nor clothing. In their despair, they went to Rawlings, where a train load ol clothing, pro visions and annuity goods wers storsd, and wbieb should have been distributed long delore ; but the meshes ol \"red tape\" entangled them, and not a pound ol Hour nor an article of clothing could be issued at that point. lbs story of ths outbreak has dssn so graphic: ally told in tbe journals of lbe day lhrougbout tbe eountry that there seems to be no present demand for an authentic history ; but, on tbe otber hand, now is the time to summarize the whole wretebed dusiness for the enlightenment of future genera tions. lbe bloody incidents of the eampaign and the fatal blunders of the \"powers that bs\" in dealing witb tbe red-handed murderers are all fresh in the minds ol our peopls, and it is not im possiblo that a calm review ol tbe matter may aid tbe public in arriving at some eorreet conclusions on tbe vexed question ol Indian management, at least as lar as the Colorado Utes are concerned. Rev. B. F. Crary, Presiding Flder of the Netbodist Conference for Northern Colorado and Wyoming, made a thorough investigation of tho matter, and wrote some stinging artieles upon tho subjeet, whieh were printed in the newspapers of the day ; but the goods still rotted in the ware house, and the Indians went hungry and naked. For a wondsr, howsvsr, they did not murder the Agent and go upon tbe war path. Indian nuturs is an anomaly. It was stated at the outset that the rebellion was eauseless.

But an Indian never forgets or forgives an injury, and all these slights and injnstiees were treasured np against a day of reckoning with tbe whites. All whites are the same to all Indians, If a horse-thief steals an Indian pony, the Indian gets even with the first white man wbose stoek is attainable. If the Indian Bureau fails to furnish supplies, the Indian forages on ths white settlers, begging what he ean and stealing the rest. An Indian with a grievance is worse than a dear with a sore head, Hs is never quite satisfied witb any atonement, vicarious or direct. Indeed, his griev ance grows by what it feeds on os that character, and the more he is placated tbe more implacable he becomes, lhat was Father Neeker's error, perhaps.

At that time, however, no one supposed that the hostility of the Indians to Agent NeeKsr wonld lead them to murder him und bis associates, und little attention was paid to tho trivial eompluints of the Wbite River delegu tion, though their visit wus duly reported to the proper uuthorities ut Washington and elsewhere.

Early in the summer, they occupied the territory over whieh troops must pass to reaeb them. Slowly they rstrsatsd toward ths Agsney, burning the grass to render it difficult for eavalry to operate against them, lbey purchased arms and ammu nition of the most approved pattern and in large quantities. Within six weeks of the outbreak, one trader sold them three oases of Winehesters and a large amount of ammunition, and the last Utes I mst inquired of me for more, lbey gathered disaffeeted bucks from the Uneompahgre and Uinta Ageneies, and got mad because the Agent at White River would not feed them.

It happened, how ever, that the Indians made no demonstrations against the settlers, and the only effect of all this \" military activity\" was to awaken a sense of inse eurity which could not be allayed for soms wssks, lbere was a frantie demand for arms and ammuni tion, which Gov. Pitkin was unable to supply, ths Stats bsing almost destitute of military supplies. Neanwhile, an almost feverish anxiety prevailed as to the probable eourse of the Southern or Un eompahgre Utes, under Ouray and Ignacio, Would they join their White River brethren and fight, or would Ouray, the known friend of ths whites, sueeeed in keeping them quiet and peace ful? As the telegraph line in that direetion was only extended to Del Norte, at that time, it was not until Sunday morning, Oetober 5, that news earns from that quarter, and then it was in the shape of the following startling dispateh : All these fears wers happily groundless. Gen, Oook reaebed Lake City in due tims, and found the seare already subsiding, Chief Ouray having asserted his eontrol over the tribe, and Ignaeio, instead of being on the war-path, was disposed to treat the matter lightly, having no particular love for ths Whits River Utss.

Although, in point of faet, the bos tiles were engaged in watching ths movement of the regular soldiers, and made no advance in the direetion of the white settlements, it could not bo known that such was the cass, and ths general alarm eould not be eondemned as causeless, lhe couriers and scouts did not bring in any news of Indians, but rumors were thick and fast, and no sooner was ons scars ovsr than another broks out.

Pitkin was presently enabled to sat isfy the people that they had little to fear from tho Utes, and soon publie sentiment perversely set in the opposite direetion. Instead of fearing the Indians would eome, the miners and prospectors leaned baek on their guns and prayed for Indians to eome and be shot. When news of the Ageney massaere was received, the indignation of the eiti zens of Colorado was so great that it was with much difficulty that Gov. Pitkin prevented tbe State militia and minutc-men from making an advanco upon ths reservation and the hostile Indians, lho Governor foresaw, however, that such au advance would be the death-signal of the eaptive women and children from the Ageney who were in the hands of the hostiles, and humanity prompted an effort to seeure their re lease before any steps were taken toward punishing the assassins and murderers. \u201e, \u00ab ,, . 8ii.vi:i!roi?, October 5. ?h t?Ole. /^.

After earefully discussing the matter with a due regard for the importance, the advantage and disadvantage of the step, they earns to the conclusion that it was not wise to aecept this proffer on ths part of ths Indians, as it might lsad to another Nodoe trap, and to lhornburgh's becoming another Canby. His seout, Nr, dosepb Rankin, was especially strong in opposition to ths rsqusst of the Indians, Naj. lhornburg's orders were not to make the first fire on the Indians, but to await an attack from them. After two lines had thus faced each other for about ten minutes, Nr, Rankin, the seout, who is an old Indian fighter, seeing the danger in which the eommand was placed, hurried direct to Naj, lhornburg's side and requested him to open fire on the enemy, saying at the same time that that was their only hope. Naj, lhornburg replied: \" Ny God! I dare not ; my orders ars positive, and if I violate them and survive, a eortrt-martial and ignominious dis missal may follow, I feel as though myself and men wers to bs murdered.\" By this time, the Indians had flanked the sold isrs, and giving the war-whoop, opened fire, lhe wagon-train was corraled about thres-fourths of a mils to ths rsar of ths command, and tho Indians got bstwssn ths wagon-train and ths command. lhs cavalry was dismounted and fighting on foot and slowly retreating. Naj, lhornburg then concluded to march bis column within hailing distanee of the Agency, where he would aecept the proposition of the Indians. But he was never allowed to earry out hi\u00bb designs. Here it beeame apparent how thin the disguise of friendship nad been, and lhorn burgh was soon convinced how fatal would have been the attempt for him, accompanied by only five men, to treat with them. Naj. lhornburg, seeing the danger which threatened his eommand from the position of the Indians, at onee mounted about twenty men, and at the head of them he dashed forward with a valor unsurpassed by Napoleon at the Bridge of of Lodi, made a ebarge on the savages bstwssn ths command and ths train. lhe eommand had reached tho point where the road crosses Nilk Creek, another tributary of the Bear, inside the reservation and in the limits of Summit County, Colorado, about twenty-five miles north of the Ageney, when they were attacked by the hostiles, numbering, it is believed, between two hundred and fifty and three hundred warriors, who had been lying in ambush.

Naj. lhornburg at onee threw his eommand into position, and the Indians cams up in lins of battle to within about throe hundred yards and halted, putting a bold face on ths matter and showing a deeided determination to fight. lhe seens of the attack was peculiarly fitted for ths Indian msthod of warfare, and showed plainly that it had been chosen by the ehiefs in command"], [190, "142 HISlORY OF COLORADO. for the identieal purpose to whieh it was devoted. When lhornburg's eommand entered the eanon, they found tbemselves bstwssn two roeky bluffs, about thirteen bundred yards apart and from one to two hundred feet high, lbese bluffs were held by the Indians in force, and some broken ground, reaohing down nearly to the ereek, was also oeeupied by the savages, so that an advance through ths eanon was impossible, and, by cutting off retreat, the Indians eould effectually \"bottle up\" the eom mand in the eanon. In effeet, that was aeeom plished, though the bravery of the troops in entrenehing themselves defeated the undoubted purpose of the Indians to annihilate them. whieh required all the foree possible to smother it. No water eould bs obtained, and ths smoks was suffocating ; but the fire passed, finally, away. About sundown, the savagss charged the works, but were repulsed, and retired to their positions on ths blufis, whsnee firing was resumed early on the following morning, lhe men in the trenehes were pretty well protected by that time, but the horses and mules were constantly falling at the crack of the sharp-shooters' rifles. During the early part of the first night of ths siegs, ths seout, Rankin, who had warned lhorn burg of his great danger on the previous day, made his way out of the beleaguered eamp and, mounted on a strange horse, his own having been shot in ths fight, started to earry the bloody news over the 100 miles that stretched between him and Rawlins. Rankin's ride bids fair to pass into history with that of Sheridan, immortalized by Buchanan's famous poem. It was a daring venture at best, and its danger was not the only feature whieh marked it as extraordinary, lhe way was rough, as well as wild and lonely, and, ordinarily, the the distanee would hardly be cov ered in two days ; yet Rankin rode it in twenty eight hours, leaving ths battls-fisld at 10 o'eioek Nonday night and reaching Rawlins Wednesday morning about 3 o'clock.

Not an Indian eould be seen, but the incessant erack of their Sharp's and Winchester rifles dealt fearful destruction among the horses and men. lhe groans of the dying and agonizing cries of the wounded told what fearful havoc was being made among the determined and desperate command. Every man was bound to sell his life as dearly as possible. Other couriers were sent out from the eamp on succeeding evenings, through one of whom word was sent to Capt. Dodge's eompany of eolored cav airy, then approaching from the direetion of Nid dis Park, informing tbsm of ths outbreak and eautioning them to be on tbeir guard. Capt. Dodge's eommand only mustered about forty men, and was eneumbered with a wagon train ; but, with almost unexampled bravery, they determined to advanee and succor the beleaguered garrison of the rifle-pits on Nilk River, At the Rawlins Crossing of the Bear, the wagon train was de tached and sent north to Fortification Creek, while Capt.

As it was, he ap preached within hailing distance of tho rifle-pits without deteetion ; but then arose a new difficulty and a new danger, Payne's sentinels would cor tainly discover them if they approached nearer, and how eould they escape being fired upon as enemies in the guise of friends?

In fast, an alarm was sounded in tbe trenehes at their approach, and the men sprang to arms to defend themselves, as tbey supposed, from a new attack by the Indians, Dodge halted his command and sent out his two guides, Gordon and Nellon, to eommunioate with Payne. lbey oalled out to the pickets that it was a company of cavalry, come to the rescue, but the statement was regarded as a ruse of the Indians, Finally, Gor don's voiee was reeognized by somo ons in the trenches, and all doubts wers at ones dispelled.

Gen, Adams, on the other hand, was not author izsd to offsr any terms for their surrender, and it is entirely safe to say that he could have accomplished nothing witbout Ouray's assistance, and Ouray could have accomplished nothing without profuse promises of immunity from punishment, whieh, unhappily, bid too fair to be realized at this writing.

Gen, Charles Adams, a well-known Coloradoan, was entrusted with this dslieats mission. He had been an Indian Agent, and was well acquainted with the Utes, besides being a personal friend of Chief Ouray.

Nany Congressmen had visited Colorado during the summer, and eaeh one of them sided with our own members. Senator leller introduced a resolution requiring the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to substantiate his statement that miners wsrs on ths reservation by detailed accounts of the \" encroachments \" to which he had referred in his report to Congress. lhe resolution directed him not only to specify tbe violations of the Brunot lreaty by white settlers, but also to stats what steps, if any, the Indian Bureau had taken to pro teet the reservation, as required by the treaty \" and such other informa tion as was in his possession,\" for the information of the Senate. \" Nr, Belford stated that the Uts reservation, iu Colorado, consisted of 12,000,000 acres, or 4,000 for every man, woman and child, in the Ute tribe. He was opposed to the committee amendments to the Senate bill, and hs prsdieted that if they were adopted, that next year would witness a renewal of the eonfliet which bad recently attracted ths attsn tion of ths country. Hs challsngsd Congsr, or any officer of the Interior Department, to point bis finger to a eomplaint ever made by the Ute Indians against the people of Colorado. If those amendments were adopted, as certain as God reigned above, next spring ths teeming thousands which would pour into Colorado would cross tbs lins of that reservation, and would prospect the mountains for mineral wealth, and the Government would not havs ths powsr to errrest tbs progrsss of ths vast tribe.

But now tbe enterprise and avidity of the white man had discovered treasures of silver and gold in the neighborhood of these mountains, and one had been fuuud within twenty- five miles of the Ute reservation.

It embraced nearly all the territory since included in tbe 8tate ok Colorado. the wealth ok Leadville lay locked up witbin its limits, to say notbing ok Cilpiu, Clear Creek and otber mining districts, since developed so wonder- fully. Its sbining sands carried a wealth of golden grains, which, in later years, made fortunes lor thousands. Nevertheless, in its infancy, it was distinguished for nothing but maguillcent scenery and some uncertain reports of bidden riches, which might, or might not, be veriiied. the tirst political division of that portion of tbe 8tate of Kausas, wbicb embraced the Pike's Peak gold region, was organised by the people of Aura- iia, iu the fall of 1858. Its boundaries seem to have beeu rather loosely detiued, but tbe intention was to embrace al! tbe country wbicb bad been explored as well as all which had been settled up to tbat time, tbe great chain of parks was included together witb most of tbe mountain ranges aud river valleys encircling them. Auraria was tbe couuty seat, and the only settlement. It wasn't much of a settlement, to be sure, but tbe absorbing interest in politics which has since char- acteri^ed Colorado, was developed iu tbe early days of tbe settlement, and Auraria, instead of grow- iuA up on \u00bb milk-and-water diet of politics, seemed to spring at once, full-panoplied, into existence as a political center. A mere nandiul of men organ- i?ed tbe couuty aud sent its Lrst representative to tbe Kansas Legislature. History is silent as to the etleot his appearance produced in that body, but, as be drew bis pay along with the other 8olons, it is to be presumed tbat he did his share of the talking and voting, and perhaps attracted no more attention at the capita! than the average member from the counties on the western limit of settlement, save in the amount ol mileage to which he found himself entitled. the present boundaries of Arapahoe County were dcttned by Covernmeit 8urveyors iu 1861. the territory of Colorado had been established by au act of Congress, and >Vi!Iiam Cilpin bad been commissioned (lovernor. It was under his direction that the territory was subdivided into thirteen counties, of which Arapahoe was still the chief in importance though not iu sixe. on the north, was more than twice as large, aud on the south, Douglas, since divided into Douglas aud Libert, was considerably larger. Arapahoe County was then, and is now, a parallelogram, thirty miles wide, and 162 miles long from east to west, extending from the line ok Kansas on the east to within a few miles of tbe mountains. As originally constituted, there did not seem to be much \" outcome \" in Arapahoe County.

It is loeated on the Platte River, and is surrounded by a fine farming couu try, wsll watered aud well tilled. Its proximity to Denver reduces its trade to small proportions; but, otherwise, Littleton is a flourishing suburb, and is steadily growing in size and natural beauty. In tbe summer mouths, it is almost smbowsrsd in a mass of foliage, through whieh its white cottages gleam and shine like a New England villags in its bower of elms.

Old residents affirm that the flood of 1864 was by far the heaviest ever seen in Cherry Creek, sines tbs settlement of Denver, It eertainly was tbe most destructive, but ths writsr has always doubted whether it was greater in aetual volume than some whieh have been reeorded sinee, notably the flood of 1878.

If tbe channel had bssn elear, and if tbe waters bad been permitted to flow \" unvexed to tbo sea,\" as they did after the bridges wsnt out, tbs flood of 1878 migbt possibly have passsd off as a rather small and insxpensivs affair. Who knows, positively, that the great flood of 1864 would not have left Denver unharmed, if Denver had not obstructed its passage ? Nevertheless, it was undouhtedly a wild deluge of waters, and it same down with most appalling foree and sudden ness upon the slumbering city, about tho hour of midnight of the day and date first written. it he eoming from, and whither going? lhess wsrs tbs questions, soliloquized and spoken, ons to tbs otber.

Otbers laughed at the idea of a road ever becum iug profitable ou a route a great part of which would lie in seetions where the snow lies on the ground during seven months in the year; as to the metalliferous wealth of tlie country proposed to be traversed, opinions differed \u2014 only the few, how svsr, insisting upon ths wealth of the mountains. Another argument advanced was, that the grades on any route likely to bs sslseted in crossing tbe high ranges surrounding ths plateaus of tbs Boeky Nountaili system, would be, if not impracticable, at least so heavy as to be expensive beyond all computation, and tbe treasury of any com pany that migbt undertake the task would be subject to a eonstant drain to meet expenses, and with tbe most stringent economy would be unable to make both ends meet, lbe truth or fallacy of these objections will be demonstrated as we proceed in the history of this remarkable work. lhe projected routs was from Denver, via the Platte Canon, through Park County, through lrout Crssk (Mon to the Arkansas at ths month of lrout Crssk, lbis latter seemed to be ths F>o\u00ab'nt ci' a/,^\u00bbi for further extensions through the entire mountain region. From there an easy water-grade led up ths Arkansas to its hsad, numerous passes afforded favorable routes to the then newly discovered San duan eountry, and a practicable route led westward to 2 eonneetion with the Utah system of railroads, and through them to the Paeifie Coast, It was also decided to build a broad rc>2cl to the valuable quarries at Norrison, making the sntirs road, ns projected, one hundred and fifty miles iu length. lhe building of the road was lot to a eou struetion eompany, eousisting of prominent Den ver meu, and ground was broken in the fall of 1873, At the very outset, tbs company was mst by tbs most discouraging obstacle that had yet been eneountered \u2014 the financial panic of 1873. Bailroads were the heaviest sufferers thereby, tbe ill sueeess of many heavy railroad enterprises causing all schemes of this char2cter to bs rsg2rdsd with doubt and suspicion, lhe ds prssssd condition of business and the want of faith of aggregated eapitai in ail enterprises requiring heavy outlays of money, very much retarded the progress of ths work; and it W2S not until duly 1, 1874, that ths first sixteen miles of tho road \u2014 seven miles of the main line, and nine miles of the Norrison braneh \u2014 were put in sueeessful operation.

During the next two years, nothing was dune un the extension of the road, lhe Norrison branch was successfully operated, and the original pro jeetors of the road labored hard and incessantly to induce a renewal of confidence in their enter prise and its ultimate financial success. At last. in the spring of 1876, the financial skies, which. for nearly three years, had spread a pall-like blaekness over the entire country, began to lighten, and a new, determined and united sffurt was made to sseure the renewal of active operations, lbe effort was sueeessful, A sufiicient amount of money was raised on subscriptions to the capital stock to warrant the commencement of the exteu sion, and 2 bold move was made into the canon, whieh had been pronounced impassable, not alone by non-professionals, but by experienced civil engineers. lbe heaviest part was., of eourse, that through the canon, but wben these difficulties had been overcome, tbe Kenosba range of mountains skirt ing tbe eastern edge of tbe South Park had still to be surmounted, and bere again engineering esti mates were at fault. Even those wbo bad wit nessed the sueeessful operations for more than three years of a similar pieee of work at Veta Pass, said that tbe tbing could not be clone \u2014 that no safe road-bed eould be constructed along the route laid out on Kenosba Hill \u2014 that the first storm would send the road-bed into the canon below. Notwithstanding all of tbese objections, which certainly seemed insurmountable to most men, the road has never stopped an instant since tbs first day of resumption of active operations. In the early spring of 1878, it bad penetrated the lower canon ssveral miles ; at midsummer the road had passed tin,, ugh the lower canon, and had arrived at Bailey's ranch. In the spring of 1879, it had reached the foot of Kenosba Hill, and as this aeeount is written (September 1), it has crossed the range, and is now in tbe South Park, 103 miles from Denver, with the remainder of the line graded to the mouth of lrout Creek. Few, except those who have seen the road, or were on the ground during the progress of the work, ean form a reasonable idea of tbe physical difficulties that presented themselves to the eon structing engineers. In many places, walls of per pendieular roek deseended sheer to the water's edge, preseutiug a smooth, unbroken suifaee, worn by tbe action of the water, until it was impossible to obtain a foothold fur the wnrkmeu. Other portions of the route presented an equally difficult problem \u2014 tbe confining of the torrent within narrower limits, or tlie turning of tbe ereek in order to avoid an impossible curve, with all ths attendant risks of 2 freshet, which would sweep away thousands of dollars worth of labor at 2 single dash, Nen were bung over cliffs of a dizzy height to drill the holes for blasting, Otbers wsrs eompelled to stand waist-deep in water fresh from eternal snows, and rushing past at tbe rate of six miles an hour, a pressure against which it was exceedingly difficult for tbem to maintain tbeirfooting.

It is tbougbt that the Colorado Central will shortly be extended ovsr tbs sams routs, which is at ones dirsct and practicable. lhe inception of this important enterprise dates back to dune, 1861, when the Overland Stage Company was seeking a nearer outlet from Colo rado to Utah and California, Golden was just then tbe most ambitious town in Colorado, and joined with the Stage Company and some public spirited citizens of Gregory Guleb and Spanish Bar in fitting out an expedition to explore and survey a route for a wagon road from Golden to Salt Lake, Capt, E, L, Berthoud, now, and for many years engineer of tbe Colorado Central road , headed the p2rty, wbieb was absent from dune till September, and explored some 1,100 miles of conn try west of the starting-point. It was claimed for tbis important survey, that it established two impor tant facts, viz, : At tbat time, aud tor some years thereafter, the idea ol building a railroad up Clear Creek canon was considered uudiluted nonsense, and nobody tbougbt it wouid ever be done, except Mr. Love land aud a lew ol bis lrieuds, wbo were inspired by bis strong laitb in tbe ultimate success ol bis scbeme. De Knew tbat the trade ok tbe mines would support a railway ; tlie only question was how it should be built. Retore be could enlist active aid in his enterprise, it was necessary tor bim to make a preliminary survey, which was doue by private subscription. Pven tben, when tbe practicability ok tbe proposed route was estab iisbed by tbe engineers' iigures, nobody was ready to invest, aud tbe work waited. A mistake bad beeu made iu providing tor a broad-gauge rond, wbicb required several tunuels aud a large amount ok expensive rock work. Narrow-gauge roads were tben almost unknown, and their special titness tor mountain detiies was still undemoustrated, to Capt, P, L. Rertboud belongs tbe bonor ol iirst suggesting a narrow gauge tor tbe mountain First, that the main diflieulties of a good direct wagon route were the first ten miles of ths eanon of Clear Creek, and the main central range at the Berthoud Pass, 10,914 feet above the sea. Seeond, that tbe eountry traversed west of this Pass was fine valleys, and that exeellent coal abounded, while ths total distanee from Golden to Salt Lake was only 458 milss, thus shortening the overland route fully 200 miles. lwo years later, Hon, W. A, H, Loveland and E, B, Smitb, leading citizens of Golden, went be fore the lerritorial Legislature and proeured a charter for a wagon road up Clear Creek eanon to ths mines. Some work was done on the line, but it was subsequently abandoned as impracticable, and the old wagon road from Golden Gate cousin ued to be the great highway between the valley and the mountains, Loveland never lost faith in the eanon route, however, and his next seheme was the building of a railroad whore the wagon road had failed."], [345, ""], [346, ""], [347, "HISlOBY OF DENVEB. 263 division of the Colorado Central, lhe Captain was tben stationed at Fort Sedgwick, and, at that dis tanee, could only prsssnt bis views by correspond euee.

In 1866, when the Union Paeifie Company was surveying tbe passes of the Rooky Nountains, a party of their engineers went over the old Berthoud trail and pass, and reported a practicable route from Golden westward. Every effort was put forth to induce tbe Company to loeate its line in tbis direetion, but without sueeess, lben tbe engineering diffieulties were too great. Besides tbe work in Clear Creek eanon, a tunnel over a mile long was deemed neeessary in erossing the range, and the nortbern route was adopted and built upon. lbough latterly, by foree of circumstances, the Colorado Central has been made a part and parcel of Denver's railway system, the original plan ignored tbis system entirely. Denver did not figure on tbe first maps of the road, and tbe building of the first line was not so much to connect tho two towns as to separate them. It was intended that the Kan sas Paeifie should bs extended by the Colorado Central to Golden, making Denver merely 2 way station, and the Union Paeifie eonneetion was planned to avoid Denver entirely, lbe plan was admirable enougb in conception, but tbere was a fatal defect in it, in that it undsrsstimatsd tbs strength of the opposition. Denver built to a eon nection witb tbe Union Paeifie at Cheyenne before the Colorado Central was eommeneed, and, in 2 short time thsrsaftsr, projected a line to ths south which, at onee, made the capital of tho lerritory also its railway eenter. After ths termination of tbis survey, in 1866, the subjeet rested until tbe spring of 1867, when the Colorado Central Railroad Company, fully re-organized, proeeeded to inaugurate ths con struction of its Iins. lhs first work was dono bstwssn Golden and Denver, in aid of wbieb des ferson Couuty voted 3100,000 iu bonds.

In 1870, tbe Boston managers of the Union Paeifie interested tbsmsslves in the promotion of the Colorado Central scheme with a view to making that road what it has sinee beeome, in a certain sense, a \" feeder \" of ths main line. At that time, ths Union Pacific bad no Colorado connection, ths Dsnvsr Pacific having bssn absorbed by the Kan sas Pacific, Chief Engineer Siekels, of the Union Pacific, beeame associated with Capt, Berthoud, engineer of the Colorado Central, and together they surveyed and staked a narrow-gauge line from Golden up ths canon to Gilpin and Clsar Crssk Counties, the main line dividing at the forks of Clear Creek and extending np each branch of the stream.

Upon its completion, work was pushed upon the main liue for some time, but after tbe whole distance had bssn eitbsr completely or partially g-raded and tbe track bad been laid to tbe Boulder Couuty liue, a few miles beyond Long mont, tbe dulesburg branch was abandoned, and not a dollar has been expended thereon from 1873 until the present time. A few days later, tbe officers eleeted by ths new Board took possession of tbo road, lbese pro ceedings and certain subsequent acts of lawlessness in bolding possession did not redound greatly to ths eredit of Colorado railway management, and perhaps the less said about them the better. It was undoubtedly true, bowever, that the immedi ate patrons of the line, particularly ths counties which bad voted bonds to help build the road, wers bsttsr satisfied with tbs Colorado management than ai\u00bby other, and public opinion sustained Nr, Love land in bis possession. Still anotber monument to the vaulting ambi tion whieh vainly sought to overleap Denver is the deeaying grade of the Golden A South Platte Railroad, a proposed feeder of the Colorado Central, which sought to intercept the Denver A Rio Grande, at Littleton, ten miles south of Denver, and to divert tbe traffie of that lins from Dsnvsr to Goldsn. lbis grads was built and abandoned in 1 873, lhe failure of these sebemes, however, was not entirely due to Denver's acknowledged suprem aey. lbe panic of 1873 was peculiarly fatal to all new railway enterprises, and the Bostonians who had been backing Nr, Loveland and bis friends suddenly deserted them, sacrificing most of tho investments they had made up to that time, rather than risk further development of their schemes. After fighting for a whole year to get control of the property, tbe Union Pacific peopls proposed 2 eompromise, whieh was finally affected, and whieh resulted in several important extensions of the line, lhe long-lookeci-for outlet to the Union Pacific was finally eompleted via Fort Collins to Cheyenne ; the Georgetown Branch of the Nountain Division was extended from Floyd Hill to Georgetown, and the Central Branch from Black Hawk to Central, About the same time, the Denver line was straight snsd from Clear Creek, crossing so as to run into Denver direct, and depots and tbsir appurtenances were established at tbe eapital. From that time forward, ths road did a profitable business.

After his resignation, the reetorsbip was assumed by Rev. H. B.

On the night of No vsmbsr 29, 1869, a tornado passed over the build ing, then under roof, and left it a heap of ruins. Assistance eame promptly, however, and the hall was rebuilt at ouee. Iu the fall of 1871, an ap peal was made to the East for the means to establish a theologieal sebooi. In response to this appeal, Hir. Nathan Natthews, of Boston, built, at his owu cost, 2 handsome building for this purpose, in con noetion with darvis Hall. Natthews Hall, as tbs sebool is called, was formally opened September 19, 1872, Nr, darvis, in addition to his former liberality, in 1870, gave 310,000, to be invested as might be thought proper, and uot touched until tbe principal was 320,000, when the income should be used for tbs education of young men for the ministry, lhs fund was invsstsd in leal estate, which is now considered worth 320,000, though as yet it is unproductive. In 1874, Bishop Bandall died, after a life of the most active usefulness, iu whieh but oue thought animated bim \u2014 how to do the most for the Cbureb wbose interests he was appointed to serve. He was sueeeeded by Bishop dobu F, Spalding, Rev, P, Voorhees Fiueb sueceediug to the rectorate of St, dobn s. During the first year of Bishop Spalding's ad ministration, the convocation cf Wyoming and Col orado was formed. Before this, the distriet bad not been perfectly organized, though Bishop Bandall had held convocations regularly, lhe missionary district was now clearly defined, however, and tbe parishes put in order. In 1875 the requirements of the Church and tbe extension of the city made it necessary to build a uew ebureb to accommodate those living at a distanee from St, dobn's, and lrinity Nemorial Chapel was built, immediately supplying a want that bad long beeu felt in that quarter of the eity, which until tben bad been entirely witbout ebureb facilities.

It is a suburb of Denver, in fact, being situated two miles distant on tbe line of tbe Colorado Cen tral road, A dummy engine makes regular trips to and from Argo every day, and tbe passenger car attached is usually well idled witb attaches and employes of tlie works, and visitors, so many of tbe latter are attracted, indeed, tbat of late tbe works bave been partially closed to strangers, and a card ot introduction is necessary to insure access. tbe Company owns eighty acrcs ot land which lies on 5 beautiful eastward slope, overlooking Denver from tbe northwest bank of tbe Platte, aud tbe works themselves are visible from almost every part of tbe city, tbougb distant enough to prevent tbe smoke and noxious vapors ot' tbeir immense stacks ot chimneys trom poisoning the air. the story ok Prof. Dill's career in Colorado is something like the history of the state itself. the great works at Argo are the outgrowth of a small beginning made many years ago at a critical moment in tbe bistory of Colorado mining.

As early as 1861, a Dr. Rurdsall, of Nevadaville, bad been elaborating a smelting proeess, but neither bis patient labor nor tbe efforts of succeeding- metallurgists bad amounted to any tbing until Dill came upon tbe tield.

Amusing stories are told of the sharp controversies between tbe enthusiastic: Gilpin and tbe practical young professor, who refused to look at anything through rose-eolored spectacles. After examining the grant thoroughly, and making bis report, Professor Hill spent some time studying the mineralogy of Gilpin County, and finally eon eluded that tbe rich ores of Grsgory Gulch could bs successfully treated, and that there was a large margin for profit in tbeir treatment. lbe officers of the Company occupy an elegant two-story stone building. 77x47 feet, with a \"tall tower \" atop, from wbicb a splendid view is had not only of the works, but of Denver, the m, ,unt ains, and the eountrv in every direction.

All tbe leading mining and railway corporations of the State have legal rsprsssntatives in Denver, as well as loeal attorneys in the places where their business is done, and so the bar of Denver embraces in effect the leading business done in the State, exeept that Pueblo is well provided with able attorneys, wbo take eare of ber litigation. cooperation.

It would be invidious, of eourse, to mention individual ministers as examples of sueeess or failure in Denver, but types of the two classes may perbaps be sketched with propriety, lbs popular type is a man of warm impulses and earnestness, rather than cold intellectuality.

As a consequence of this high standard, tho ebances of success at the bar of this eity are no better for a medium lawyer than in ths East, ex eept that tbe people are more generous in extending support to worthy and ambitious young praetition ors than in most older cities. In the East, the busiusss is controlled mainly by a few old firms, aud new men labor up the ladder very slowly, if they rise at all.
