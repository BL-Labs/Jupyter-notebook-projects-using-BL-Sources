Yield thou to me ! \" But the outlaw cried, \" Now, if thou knowest not fear, Out with thy sword ! by good knight's word, \" I will give thee battle here.\" \" Come on I\" cried that prince of dauntless heart \" Yet pause while I alight, For I never will play the craven's part, At odds with thee to fight.\" He sprang from his steed, he drew his blade, And a terrible fray began, The very first stroke that Prince Edward made, Blood from the Gordon ran. At the second stroke that Prince Edward made, The Gordon fell on his knee ; But he did not kneel to cry for aid \u2014 Of a loftier heart was he. To his feet he sprang, and the angry clang Of their flashing swords did sound Far through tlie green and solemn woods Stretching in beauty round. The Gordon is pale, and his strength doth fail, And his blood is ebbing fast, But the spirit so high, in his flashing eye, Is dauntless to the last. He hath struck the prince on his mailed breast, But the prince laughed scornfully \u2014 \" Oh, was it the wood-breeze stirred my vest, Or a leaf from yonder tree ?\" There is bitter grief in the Gordon's eye, For he feels his strength depart ; It is not that he fears to die- To be conquer'd grieves his heart \u25a0, 5\u00b0"], [63, "He sinks, like a gallant ship o'erthrown By the blast and the driving surf : \" I yield me not I\" is his last faint tone, As he falls on the trampled turf.

He sheath'd his blade, he sprang to aid The Gordon as he lay, \" Rise up,\" cried he, \" my valorous foe, Thou hast borne thee well to-day.\" He kneel'd by his side, he stanch'd the tide Of life blood flowing free ; With his scarf he bound each gaping wound, And he sooth'd their agony. He lifted the Gordon on his steed, Himself he held the rein : \" I hold thee,\" he said, \" for a knight indeed, And I give thee thy life again.\" There was bitter grief in the Gordon's eye ; Not for defeat that grief, But he wept for his broken loyalty To such a generous chief. Humbly he bent his knightly head Writh a changed and gentle brow : \" Oh, pardon ! I yield, I yield ! \" he said ; \" I am truly conquer'd now '\" Behold how mercy softeneth still The haughtiest heart that beats ; Pride with disdain may be answer'd again, But pardon at once defeats. The brave man felt forgiveness melt A heart by fear unshaken ; He was ready to die for his loyalty To the prince he had forsaken.

But just in the middle \u2014 oh ! shocking to tell \u2014 From his rope in an instant poor harlequin fell ; I Yet he touch'd not the ground, but with talons outspread, Hung suspended in air at the end of a thread. Then the grasshopper came, witha jump & a spring, r] Verylongwashisleg, though but short was hiswing; J He took but three leaps, and was soon out of sight, Then chirp'd his own praises the rest of the night . With steps so majestic the snail did advance, And promised the gazers a minuet to dance ; Butthey all laugh'dsoloud that hepull'd in his head, And went in his own little chamber to bed. Then as evening gave way to the shadows of night, Their watchman, the glow-worm, came out with _t> his light ; J Then home let us haste, while yet we can see, , For no watchman is waiting for you and for me."], [117, ""], [118, ""], [119, ""], [120, ""]]
