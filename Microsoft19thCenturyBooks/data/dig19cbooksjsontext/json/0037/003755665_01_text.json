Allerton is one of the small, sleepy little towns which drag on an unprosperous exist ence in the rural districts of southern England. It can boast of a weekly market, and contains a decadent grammar school and a County Bank, and in the High Street are substantial houses with stone facings, which recall the days of its earlier grandeur, when the Hunt Ball was held at the ' Red Lion,' and was an era in the lives of the county gentry, and when two mail-coaches changed horses daily at the entrance of the inn-yard, which is now only tenanted by two shabby flies and a four- vol. i, B"], [12, "2 VANESSA. wheeled trap. Those palmy days are long since gone by, and the rising generation of Allerton is too far removed from them to han ker after the past, however much some of its more aspiring spirits may chafe against the sordid round of cares, the petty tracasseries, and local interests among which their lot is cast. Some such dissatisfaction may have filled the hearts of the two sisters who sat at work in a small and poorly furnished room of a house in one of the back streets of Allerton, although it was not likely to take precisely the same form in each case, since they were as dis similar in disposition as in appearance. Amy, the elder of the two, with her oval face, deli cately cut lips, and fair hair and skin, might have served as a model for the Madonnas of Raphael's early style ; while Helen, with an olive-brown complexion, a low and broad forehead, shaded by heavy masses of dark hair,"], [13, "THE CHRYSALIS. 3 not too smoothly braided, and with a figure angular and unformed, as it is apt to be at the age of sixteen, could only claim possibili ties of beauty which were as yet undeveloped. Both girls were busily at work, Helen stitch ing seams in the sewing-machine, while Amy applied herself to the discouraging task of mending the finger-tops of a well-worn pair of kid gloves ; and when all was done she dipped a feather in ink, and smeared it over the trace of stitches. ' There ! ' she said, with a sigh which ex pressed as much discontent as satisfaction ; ' that wearisome business is done ; and when I have worn the gloves for one Sunday, I suppose that it will be all to do again.' Helen looked up, stopping the click of the machine for a moment to reply : ' I hope that the game is worth the candle, Amy. I met Dennis in the street yesterday, who was looking forward as usual to Sunday \u00a3 2"], [14, "4 VANESSA. afternoon, but I doubt whether he would dis cover whether your hands were gloved in kid or cotton.' ' He may not have the opportunity of dis covering,' said Amy, hastily ; ' he assumes too much when he takes it for granted that we shall walk together, as if I were a maid-servant on her Sunday out \u2014 except, indeed, that a maid-servant is much better dressed.' ' How you vex your soul on the subject of dress,' rejoined Helen; 'my theory that shabbiness is a badge of gentility is so very convenient and reassuring, and Dennis has the profoundest contempt for what he calls the accidents of life.' \u2022'You always quote Dennis O'Brien's opinions as a law against which there is no appeal,' said Amy, with increasing annoyance. ' I claim the right to think and act for myself. You are altogether mistaken if you imagine that I have given him the right to dictate to me."], [15, "THE CHRYSALIS. 5 ' I do not presume to understand your relations,' said Helen, setting her machine at work again with an energy which gave her the advantage of the last word. ' I very much doubt whether you understand them yourself, but perhaps Dennis is more clear-sighted.' ' I wonder when mamma's interview with Uncle Richard will come to an end,' said Amy, when the next pause in Helen's work took place. ' I shall be so glad to escape from the noise of the machine.' . ' The noise will be less aggravating if you work it yourself,' said Helen. ' If you will finish this skirt for me, I can go and make tea. Mother is always exhausted by Uncle Richard's visits, and the appearance of tea may have a soothing effect, and will also remind him that his visit has run to length.' ' I will make tea and take it in myself,' said Amy. ' Your hair is rough, and you have"], [16, "6 VANESSA. no cuffs on, and Sarah is still less presentable on a Saturday afternoon.' Although Helen might have appreciated some respite from her work, she acquiesced in this division of labour, and Amy repaired to the kitchen, where she prepared the tea-tray with the neatness and refinement which she so well understood, and caused Sarah, the general servant, to carry it upstairs for her, dismissing her again to the lower regions be fore she opened the door of the room in which Mrs. Mertoun sat with her wealthy brother in-law. Amy's colour was just heightened by the ex ertion, and her drooping eyelids were prettily expressive of a desire to deprecate her intru sion ; but her entrance was evidently not un welcome to her uncle, whose rugged features were softened by a smile as he addressed her. ' We have been talking of you, Amy, and I do not know whether you or the tea is most"], [17, "THE CHRYSALIS. 7 welcome. Talking is dry work, when people do not agree.' ' I hope that we shall agree,' said Mrs. Mertoun, with nervous timidity of manner ; ' the suggestion has taken me by surprise, and I could not accept it without talking the matter over with Henry.' ' And why with Henry, a lad of twenty-one, hardly two years older than Amy herself, who has the best right to be consulted ? ' ' He is but young, certainly,' said Mrs. Mertoun ; ' but he is the bread-winner of the family, and so good and steady, that I cannot help putting him in my dear husband's place.' ' Do you wish me to go away, mamma ? ' said Amy, with so evident an inclination to linger that her mother wanted resolution to dismiss her. She took up a piece of fancy work, and while her fingers were busily em ployed, she fixed her eyes anxiously on her uncle, and said, 'How is Eva, Uncle Richard ? '"], [18, "8 VANESSA. ' She is well ; that is \u2014 no, she is far from well \u2014 languid and full of fancies ; and the doctors tell me to humour her, as if I were not at all times ready to do it. The reigning whim now is that she leads too lonely a life, and that if you were her companion, she should never be out of spirits. What should you think of it ? Your mother would have one mouth less to feed, and indeed would be saved expenses in other ways, for of course I should give you an allowance.' ' If dear mamma can spare me, I should be very happy at Leasowes,' said Amy. It was prettily said, and yet the mother felt as if the honest bluffness with which Helen might have disclaimed the possibility of leaving her home would have been more grateful to her. ' Of course she can spare you,' said Mr. Mertoun : ' she would have to do without you if you made a good marriage, of which by the"], [19, "THE CHRYSALIS. 9 by there is more chance at Leasowes than here. However, I am not going to press as if the favour were all on your side. I can only say that most girls would jump at such an offer.' ' And Amy, as you see, is not unwilling to accept it,' said Mrs. Mertoun. ' You must not think that I take an unreasonable time for consideration, if I defer my final answer for a day. I will write by to-morrow's post.' \" And if the answer is such as I have a right to expect, I will send the carriage for Amy early in next week. Eva dislikes any delay when she has set her heart on a thing, and I left her planning the arrangements for Amy's room, which, she says, must be next to her own.' ' Give Eva my very best love,' said Amy ; and though Mr. Mertoun protested with a contemptuous grunt that he was never meant to be the bearer of affectionate messages, he"], [20, "10 VANESSA. was unlikely to forget anything which might afford a moment's pleasure to his delicate and fanciful child. Amy anxiously awaited her mother's de cision when Mr. Mertoun was gone, but, as she knew by experience, the necessity for action was ever retarded by a nervous sense of responsibility. Mrs. Mertoun was en dowed with the ivy-like nature which clings with tenacity to the first object that offers a firm support, and although it was twelve years since her husband had closed a life of reckless improvidence in disgrace and ruin, she still deferred to his opinions real or imaginary, and hesitated to take any step of which he might have disapproved. Since Henry had attained to manhood, his strong sense was allowed to share the empire of his dead father, but he had imbibed many of the prejudices which had led to estrangement between the two branches of the Mertoun"], [21, "THE CHRYSALIS. 11 family, and approved of her resolution to accept no pecuniary aid at the hands of the man whom she held to be responsible for his brother's ruin. Such aid had indeed been indirectly given, for when Henry declined the proposal that he should enter his uncle's office at Bixley, Richard Mertoun's interest procured for him a clerkship in the County Bank at Allerton. Mrs. Mertoun was a graceful, lady-like woman, with great remains of beauty ; and indeed it was an article of the family creed that few younger women could vie with her in personal attractions. Richard Mertoun disliked her as heartily as near connections, who do not happen to be congenial, are prone to dislike each other ; but for the sake of his nephews and nieces he had always refused to quarrel with her. He came to Allerton at stated intervals, and the younger members of the family sometimes went to Leasowes,"], [22, "12 VANESSA. from which Henry and Helen were too apt to return with prejudices confirmed against their rich relations, while Amy never missed the opportunity of cementing that friendship i with Eva which now prompted a desire to secure her as a constant inmate. ' I must say that Uncle Richard is right,' said Amy, when she had waited in vain for her mother to enter on the subject : ' it is unnecessary to appeal to Henry unless you do it to shelter your own dislike to the scheme. To me it seems the happiest escape from dependence, for I have looked forward to becoming a governess or companion now that Helen is old enough to be useful.' ' Dependence on a near relation may be more galling than the same position among strangers,' replied Mrs. Mertoun. ' I do not think so, mamma. Uncle Richard is essentially kind to me, even when his manner is rough ; and you, who have"], [23, "THE CHRYSALIS. 13 scarcely seen Eva, can hardly imagine her gentle caressing ways. I am sure that I should be very happy at Leasowes.' ' Happier than at home, Amy ?' ' We should only be ten miles apart,' said Amy, evading a more direct reply : ' we might often meet, and I should be no longer a burden upon Henry.' ' There is another reason why I hesitated to accept your uncle's offer,' said Mrs. Mertoun. ' I fancied that you would wish to consult Dennis O'Brien.' ' To consult him ?' repeated Amy, with rising colour : ' indeed, mamma, you alto gether misconstrue our relations. I deny that he has either the right or the inclination to control my actions. It would jbe affecta tion to deny that he admires me, and any warmer seeling has grown insensibly out of our boy and girl friendship ; but he knows as well as I do that a formal engagement would"], [24, "14 VANESSA. be hopeless and absurd ; and it may be for his happiness that we should have fewer opportunities of meeting.' ' Possibly ; and it is evident that yours will not be affected by the separation.' ' Indeed, mamma, I think it will be best for both,' said Amy, candidly : ' the conscious ness that the eyes of Allerton are upon us, drawing inferences which the facts do not justify, destroys any pleasure in meeting him.' ' In such a case it may be better to part,' said Mrs. Mertoun ; ' but you must also make up your mind to see little of us all. There is no cordiality between Henry and his uncle, and he never willingly goes to Leasowes.' ' I shall try to break down the barrier,' said Amy ; ' and at all events I shall be able to come here, and to see more of you all than if I were a governess, perhaps a hundred miles away. You need not tell me that it is hard to be"], [25, "THE CHRYSALIS. 15 dependent, but surely it is still harder to live on here from week to week and year to year with little occupation and no interest in life, except that of a round of sordid economies. You may think it despicable ; Helen I know despises me for hankering after material comforts ; but it seems to me that some com- mand of money is the sum of human hap piness. Mrs. Mertoun looked doubtful and distressed, but as Helen came in to condole with her mother on the length of her uncle Richard's visit, the subject was allowed to drop ; nor was it mentioned again until late in the even ing, when the two girls had retired for the night. Mrs. Mertoun was left alone with her son Henry, and she knew how to interpret the pleading tenderness with which Amy bade her good night, so that she began, mother like, to urge the arguments in favour of accepting Richard Mertoun's proposal,"], [26, "16 VANESSA. which she had been at some pains to combat when it was first made. Henry Mertoun, whose features were marked by the thoughtful and mature gravity which is acquiredby those on whom the burden of life has fallen early, listened attentively until the story was told. ' I hardly like the idea,' he said at last ; ' you know that I did not like it for myself, and it was with your full concurrence that I refused a similar offer. But the position may suit Amy, who never seems quite congenial with the family atmo sphere.' 'Poor child ! ' said Mrs. Mertoun ; ' she is old enough to remember when the atmosphere was very different. She was her father's darling, and he -thought that nothing was too good for her.' ' Twelve years of penury might efface the childish memory of those luxurious days, mother. But if the prospect of reviving them"], [27, "THE CHRYSALIS. 17 in Uncle Richard's grand house will make amends for the loss of home sympathy, she is welcome to go.' ' It is only an experiment, and, if it fails, she can but come back again,' said Mrs. Mertoun. ' Not if she is to come back more fastidious and intolerant of our shifts of poverty than when she went : I do not think that would be well. Let it be clearly understood that if she casts in her lot with our rich relations, she must not complain of crumpled rose-leaves. She must not barter her birthright for a mess of pottage, and then expect the blessing of the first-born.' Mrs. Mertoun looked wistfully at her son as she replied, ' If you compare Amy to Esau, Henry, the tone of your speech makes me think of Ishmael. Your hand is against every man. ' Was it not you who taught me to dislike vol. 1. c"], [28, "18 VANESSA. and mistrust my Uncle Richard ? ' said Henry. ' It seems time to forget the old grudge,' said Mrs. Mertoun. 'If your Uncle Richard is conscious that he wronged your father, and wishes to make amends to his children, I too will try to forget the past. And I may tell Amy that you consent to her going ? ' ' If my consent is necessary. We shall miss her in many ways ; and, as Helen said one day, when we were discussing the possibility of her marriage to O'Brien, \" How horribly ungenteel you and I must become when Amy's refining presence is withdrawn.\" Thus the family consent was given to Amy's migration to her uncle's house ; but she knew, in spite of her assertion to the contrary, that the matter could not be con sidered as settled until Dennis O'Brien had been taken into her confidence."], [29, "19 CHAPTER II. THE METAMORPHOSIS. Henry Mertoun and Dennis O'Brien were fellow-clerks at the county bank, and their intimacy dated from the day of Henry's first appearance there, some two years before. O'Brien, two years his senior, and already accustomed to the drudgery of the office, was kind to the shy, sensitive lad, and the friend ship between them ripened as quickly as if they had been a pair of lovers. Their leisure hours, as well as those devoted to work, were spent together ; and since O'Brien lived alone in lodgings, it was natural that he should spend much of his time with the Mertoun household. He was soon at home with them all, the object of Mrs. Mertoun's C 2"], [30, "20 VANESSA. maternal solicitude, and learning to address the girls by their Christian names, while he claimed their services in mounting his ento mological or botanical specimens as freely as if they had been his sisters. Dennis was of Irish extraction, as his name denoted, and possessed many of the charac teristics of his race. He was eager and enthusiastic, indoctrinating his associates with sentiments which were always emphatically underlined, and exacting unbounded sympathy in all his interests and pursuits. It need scarcely be added that when he divided the human race into two broadly defined classes of angels and demons, Henry Mertoun's beautiful sister did not rank among the demons. There was, as Amy had said, no formal engagement between them, for how were two young people even to think of marriage with out any more ample provision than the salary"], [31, "THE METAMORPHOSIS. 21 of a junior clerk ? But in the sweet summer twilight of May evenings, when they had listened to the singing of nightingales, and on balmy days in March as they wandered through the lanes together, plucked white violets from the banks, Amy's hand had been pressed to her lover's heart, and more soft and tender sayings had been exchanged between them than she now cared to remember. Of late, indeed, the joy of such idyllic pleasures had been marred, and Amy had drawn back, gently but reso lutely, from the freedom of their intercourse. They no longer walked together, unless Henry or Helen were willing to accompany them, and Amy's smiles were rarer on the evenings which Dennis spent at their house than at other times. His courtship became more stormy as she grew more cautious, and she said, not without truth, that he was un reasonable and exacting. Still he went and came, and hoped that the cloud would pass"], [32, "22 VANESSA. away, while Amy felt that the prospect of release from a situation of which she was weary was not her least potent motive for leaving her mother's house. The Sunday dinner was scarcely over when Dennis O'Brien's figure flitted past the win dow, and in another moment he was in the entrance passage, waiting for no response to his knock to enter the parlour. ' It is a perfect spring day,' he said ; ' all the insects must be abroad, and we ought to make great discoveries on the heath. I hoped to find you ready, Amy.' ' Helen doubts about going,' replied Amy. ' I was not speaking to Helen,' said Dennis, with a clouded brow ; ' you promised to walk to Durdham Copse with me on the first fine Sunday.' ' Henry has made his own plans for the afternoon,' observed Helen, ' and I object to being a bad third.'"], [33, "THE METAMORPHOSIS. 23 ' You had better go, Helen ; you were scarcely out of the house last week, and you ought to have a walk,' said Mrs. Mertoun. ' Then I must make Dick sacrifice himself' said Helen, seizing her younger brother by the eah ' Dick, I appeal to you as a man and a brother to afford me the honour of your company. ' I have got to grind my Greek Testament,' said Dick, doggedly, and suppressing the more powerful attraction of spending a law less afternoon in bird's-nesting with his school fellows. ' We will grind it together when we sit down to rest in the copse,' said Helen. ' I am not going to let you carry the lexicon through the streets on Sunday afternoon,' rejoined Dick, loftily. His imagination was not lively enough to con ceive the possibility of carrying it himself. ' Most true, you slave to propriety ; but is"], [34, "24 VANESSA. not Dennis as infallible an authority as the lexicon itself, and we can appeal to him in any difficulty. Be obliging for once, and you may be rewarded by falling heir to a duplicate specimen of beetle or butterfly. You know Dennis's luck and skill as a collector.' The prospect of being shoved through his task at the least possible expense of mental labour prevailed with Dick, when it was coupled with this bait, and he graciously con sented to accompany his sisters. Amy had awaited his decision with an air of placid indifference, but she and Helen lost no time in preparing for the walk, and since Dick was also dismissed to brush his jacket, Dennis was left alone with Mrs. Mertoun. He instantly turned upon her with a sort of bridled im patience. ' Is it by your orders, Mrs. Mertoun, that Amy refuses to walk with me ? ' ' She has not refused, Dennis. I have"], [35, "THE METAMORPHOSIS. 25 never spoken to her on the subject, but I do not find fault with the instinct which leads her to shun the inference which our gossipping neighbours are so ready to draw.' ' An inference in which I glory,' replied Dennis ; ' are we not all in all to each other ? It is only for the few short hours of the week which I spend in Amy's company, that I can be said in any true sense to live : at other times I barely exist.' Mrs. Mertoun replied by a constrained smile. O'Brien had never until now spoken out his heart so plainly, and before she had summoned resolution to daunt his enthusiasm by a single word of discouragement, the two girls re-entered the room, and the opportunity was lost. Helen understood her duties as a chaperon, and they walked side by side through the quiet streets of Allerton ; but as soon as they turned into the grass fields which led to Durdham Copse, she and Dick fell"], [36, "26 VANESSA. behind, and the lovers, if lovers they were to be, knew that their colloquy was to be un disturbed. Dennis made a motion to draw Amy's hand within his arm, and when she demurred, he said pleadingly, ' For this one afternoon, Amy, if never again.' Amy blushed, while she suffered the hand which trembled a little to rest lightly on his grasp, and she asked herself whether Henry or her mother had prepared him for the com munication which she had to make. ' I must have startled your mother just now,' resumed Dennis, who was himself too much agitated to observe her discomposure. ' If you had been out of the room for a moment longer, I should have gone headlong into a matter which I was resolved that you should be the first to know. I am not ungrateful to a position to which I owe my acquaintance with Henry and Henry's sister, but you know how I have always disliked the bank drudgery,"], [37, "THE METAMORPHOSIS. 27 and I am perhaps absurdly elated at the prospect of being transferred to a more con genial atmosphere. Our common interest in beetles has brought me into friendly relations with Mr. Burdon, one of the bank managers, and I had the kindest letter from him last night, telling me that he was authorized by the other trustees to offer me the curatorship of the museum at Bixley. The immediate rise in salary is not great, but the start it gives me in the only career for which I am fitted would be worth a sacrifice of income. I shall be brought into communication with scientific men, many of whom have achieved distinction from equally obscure beginnings, and I need not now despair of attaining a position worthy even of you, Amy.' He paused, chilled by her silence, and looked anxiously into her face. Amy was, in fact, too much absorbed in the thought of her own new career to be"], [38, "28 VANESSA. greatly affected by the intelligence, except from one point of view. ' The museum at Bixley ? ' she repeated. ' How strange that you should be going there just now ! My Uncle Richard's house is close to Bixley, and it was decided yesterday that I should go to live with him, as companion to his only daughter.' ' The Fates have ordained that we should not be separated,' said Dennis, triumphantly ; but Amy was able to put a different interpre tation on the facts. 'You do not know Uncle Richard, Dennis. He is a strange, cold man, with one soft place in his heart for his only child, and I am to be her slave and companion. The position will be a difficult one, and since our poverty has always been an offence in his eyes, I shall not venture to invite my acquaintance to his house.' ' True, your acquaintance,' repeated"], [39, "THE METAMORPHOSIS. 29 Dennis, with some bitterness. ' I should decline to enter his doors if I am to be designated by so cold a term. But what if I come as your affianced lover ? ' ' It is better that we should understand each other,' said Amy ; and the words were spoken with studied calmness even while the paleness of her lips betrayed the greatness of the effort. ' I have wished for an oppor tunity to declare my conviction that our present relations cannot continue. As boy and girl we have been happy together with no thought for the future, but now that we have each to make a real start in life, we must be fettered by no engagement.' ' I understand,' said Dennis, fixing his eyes on Amy with an expression of indignant scorn before which she quailed ; ' we are to exercise the right of free choice in our separate spheres.' He paused for a reply, but Amy made no attempt to contradict the"], [40, "30 VANESSA. interpretation he had put upon her words. ' And this,' he went on with increasing vehe mence, ' this is the woman I have loved \u2014 with no thought of the future, I think you said \u2014 I have lived only for the hope of calling you my own, and of providing a shrine fit for the idol of my fancy.' ' I have spoken as much for your sake as for mine, Dennis.' ' You are considerate indeed,' replied O'Brien with cold irony, and Amy felt the impossibility of continuing the conversa tion. She dropped his arm, and waited for her brother and sister to come up with them. ' Have you found a specimen ?' cried Dick, running forward ; ' remember that you pro mised me the first Painted Lady of the season. ' This is not Vanessa Cardui, but a new variety,' replied Dennis ; ' a painted lady"], [41, "THE METAMORPHOSIS. 31 which has just left the chrysalis and intends to soar above us earth worms.' ' Where is it ? Let me see ; have you let it go ?' said Dick, surveying O'Brien's empty palm with a puzzled air. ' I have let it go,' repeated O'Brien quietly. Amy declared herself to be too tired to walk to Durdham Copse, and asked Helen to return home with her ; nor has history recorded that the other two were successful in their entomological researches."], [42, "VANESSA. 32 CHAPTER III. THE MESS OF POTTAGE. Early in the following week Mr., Mertoun's carriage was sent to Allerton for his niece. Eva, like the petted child she had always been, was eager to obtain possession of the toy she had coveted, and since the family finances allowed of no unnecessary outlay, Amy's preparations were soon made. The parting was over, and she leaned back in the carriage with a delightful sense of luxurious ease. As she was whirled past the Bank, she fancied that she could distinguish the head of Dennis O'Brien above the wire-blind, as he leaned over his desk, but such recognition scarcely dashed her pleasure. The cold es trangement with which they had parted"], [43, "THE MESS OF POTTAGE. 33 seemed to her the only possible solution of the difficulties which beset her path : if he had been importunate in his constancy, or passionate in upbraiding her fickleness, their chance encounters in the streets of Bixley must have been a source of embarrassment and annoyance, but as things were, she dis missed him from her mind with the reflection that when his unreasonable anger had sub sided he would thank her for what she had done, and they might once more be friends. In order to reach Leasowes, it was neces sary to pass through the busy commercial* town of Bixley, the town in which Richard Mertoun had amassed his fortune, and in which he owned a coal and timber wharf and some other thriving concerns. The place seemed like a metropolis to Amy, coming fresh from sleepy Allerton, and she noted the stir of life with interest, and acknowledged VOL. I. D"], [44, "34 VANESSA. the numerous marks of respect paid to Mr. Mertoun's carriage with peculiar satisfaction. Another mile's drive brought her to Leasowes, a square substantial house, with that air of being made to order which is apt to pervade the domain of a self-made man of wealth. The trim pleasure grounds, with their rare shrubs and brilliant flower-beds, the splendid conservatories, and the luxurious fittings of the house, were the pride of Bixley and an object of condescending admiration when presented to the notice of the more aristo cratic county society. Amy was abashed by the appearance of the two tall servants who came to the door to usher herself and her poor little portmanteau into the hall, but her position seemed to be assured by the affectionate warmth of Eva's greeting. ' My dearest Amy ! what a long dull drive you must have had ! I wished so much to go in the carriage, but papa said that"], [45, "THE MESS OF POTTAGE. 35 it would be too much for me. Bring tea this instant, John ; or will you have lunch ? We do not dine till seven, and it is only half-past three.' ' I want nothing now ; I will have a cup of tea at your usual time,' said Amy. ' Bring tea at once,' repeated Eva with decision ; ' is not my time yours? Come to my morning-room, where we can be as lazy and as comfortable as we please. I am not at home to any one this afternoon, John,' she added as they left the hall ; and Amy felt that she was already installed as a dear and honoured inmate, not as the poor dependant on her uncle's bounty. It was easy to see how the conditions of intimacy were to be fulfilled by the two cousins. Eva's overflowing affection had hitherto lacked an object on which to expend itself, for although her father wor shipped her after his fashion, her caressing D 2"], [46, "36 VANESSA. kitten-like ways could meet with little response from a man absorbed in business cares, sparing of his words, and as rugged in nature as in feature. As Eva outgrew her childish passion for dolls, she had recourse to live creatures ; but the rarest of birds, the most unsightly of pugs, had sailed to satisfy the cravings of her heart, and since the day, now nearly two years ago, when she first observed her cousin's budding beauty, she had been the object of her unswerving admiration. Another little episode, hereafter to be men tioned, had only increased her sense of loneliness, and her conviction that her cousin's stronger nature might supply the strength and sympathy to which she might cling; and when the proposal that Amy should come to Leasowes was accepted, she felt that the obligation was all on her side. There was no family likeness between the cousins. Eva was short and slightly made,"], [47, "THE MESS OF POTTAGE. 37 with great vivacity of movement, a colourless skin, and large, liquid eyes, which seemed to bespeak a soul too large for its fragile sheath. Amy, with her statuesque grace, perfectly modelled figure, and clear, porcelain complexion, reminded those who saw her of a figure in Dresden china : she was as beautiful, and almost as cold. ' You must have had a trying day,' said Eva, caressing Amy's plump, white hand, ' saying good-bye to all at home. Can Aunt Anne forgive me for wiling you away ? ' ' She has Helen,' said Amy, not without an uneasy consciousness that Helen's niche in the family would be less easily filled. ' True, she has Helen, but \u2014 may I say it ? \u2014 that is not precisely the same thing. I have not seen Helen very often, and I think there is something antipathetic between us which I daresay we might get over if we were more together. With you it is"], [48, "38 VANESSA. altogether different, although I remember that when you settled at Allerton two years ago, and papa said that we must ask you over, I made rather a grievance of it. I loved you when you came, and I have loved you ever since.' Further expression of her eager affection was checked by the appearance of the footman with the tea-tray, and Eva presently dismissed him with a packet of notes which were to be delivered that after- noon. ' Invitations to a dinner-party,' she ex plained to her cousin. ' I would not send them out until you had actually arrived. These great formal entertainments have always been a fatigue and oppression to me, but now that you are here to share the responsibility and talk over the guests with me, I fancy that I shall almost enjoy them.' ' You take my breath away,' said Amy. ' I have no dress in which to appear at a"], [49, "THE MESS OF POTTAGE. 39 regular dinner party. You know our straits of poverty well enough to excuse my shabby dress when we are alone together ; and by and by, if Uncle Richard fulfils his vague promise of giving me an allowance, I will try not to bring discredit on you. Meanwhile I must remain in the background.' ' No, indeed, Amy. I have not transplanted you from Allerton that you may live in ob scurity. I am glad that papa's arrangements were vague, for then I may take my own measures to give them definite shape. No outlay pleases him so well as the money I spend at the Bixley shops, and we will go in the town to-morrow to order what is necessary \u2014 what I think necessary for you. When you have got your outfit, papa may please himself about your allowance.' Amy faintly disclaimed the possibility of availing herself of such a munificent offer, but her scruples were easily overruled, and"], [50, "40 VANESSA. the dolls of Eva's childhood had not sub mitted with more smiling complacency to be decked out in the silk and satin costumes which her lively fancy had devised for them. Amy did not see her uncle until she came downstairs, dressed for dinner in the simple white dress which she no longer thought it necessary to husband for more important occasions. Eva's gay spirits and eager assurances that Amy was the gentlest, love liest, and most loveable of human beings, procured for her a cordial reception from Mr. Mertoun ; he kissed her cheek, and hoped that she would be happy in her new home, since he was as ready to welcome another daughter as Eva was to adopt her as a sister. Amy could scarcely believe that this was the same Uncle Richard whose infrequent visits to the little house at Allerton were apt to bring constraint and gloom, and to cloud her mother's face with added care."], [51, "THE MESS OF POTTAGE. 41 This feeling of surprise and gratitude was partly expressed by Amy when the hour of bed-time came, and the two girls sat together over the bright wood fire which Eva's solici tude for her comfort had caused to be kindled in her room. It was an unnecessary luxury on that mild May evening, and they left the window open that they might enjoy the singing of the nightingales. ' How kind Uncle Richard was to me ! it was almost as if I had found my own dear father again,' said Amy ; and the words were spoken out of the fulness of her heart. ' I fancy that he was thinking of Uncle Henry to-night,' said Eva, thoughtfully. ' I know that the estrangement often weighs upon his mind.' ' Do tell me about it, Eva ; my mother will never go into details. I know of course the one terrible fact that distress and ruin followed, or perhaps caused my father's"], [52, "42 VANESSA. death, but I have never been able to under stand how Uncle Richard was connected with our misfortunes, nor why mamma has been so unwilling to be under any obligation to him.' ' Papa often speaks of it,' replied Eva ; ' he thinks Aunt Anne unreasonable, but of course it is natural that she should still see the cause of quarrel with Uncle Henry's eyes. Our grandfather was a country surgeon in small practice, and his two sons had both to make their way in the world. Your father, who was the eldest, went into the surgery for a time, but he did not take to it, and then he was articled to an architect, and that did not do either. There was no money forthcoming to put papa out in the world, nor to give him a tolerable education, and he was glad to take a sort of errand-boy's place in Edgar's coal and timber-yard. He worked his way up into the office by steady application, and"], [53, "THE MESS OF POTTAGE. 43 when he had been ten years a clerk, he married his master's daughter, and old Mr. Edgar, who died soon afterwards, left every thing to him when he died. Still papa says, and I think that he has a right to be proud of it, that he owes all his success in life to honest hard work, and not to any stroke of good luck. As soon as he was his own master, he tried to help Uncle Henry, who had never settled to anything, and was living on Aunt Anne's small portion. Papa made him manager of the coal-yard, with a sort of understanding that he should have a share in the business, but they could not get on to gether. There may have been faults on both sides, but he says that Uncle Henry was reckless and improvident, and would not keep accounts. At last there was a regular quarrel, and papa gave him money \u2014 5,000/. I believe it was \u2014 on condition that he should leave Bixley. Uncle Henry was very angry,"], [54, "44 VANESSA. and said that his brother had broken faith with him ; however, he took the money and went away.' ' I can just remember leaving Bixley,' 'said Amy. ' I think I was five years old. We went to a villa at Twickenham, and lived in what seemed great luxury and splendour, when I contrast it with these later years.' ' It only lasted for two years,' replied Eva. ' Papa does not know how the money went, whether in speculation, or if he only lived upon his capital. At the end of that time Uncle Henry began to write to him for help \u2014 almost threatening letters he said they were \u2014 opening up the old question of the partner ship. Papa took no notice for some time, and at last returned all the letters in a blank envelope. He blames himself for this now, since it may have driven Uncle Henry to desperation. Two days afterwards, he re ceived a letter to tell him of his sudden"], [55, "THE MESS OF POTTAGE. 45 death, and summoning him to attend the inquest' ' I remember his coming to Twickenham,' said Amy, shivering ; ' there was an execu tion in the house, and men coming in to remove the body for the inquest. Mamma was almost beside herself with the shock of his death and the knowledge of our certain ruin, and we children were huddled together, and hunted from room to room. People talk of the happiness of youth, but I think that from that day to this our lives have been a protracted misery.' ' We ought not to have revived these sad memories,' said Eva, ' only I wished you to know how it was with papa, that you might not begin with a prejudice against him. Aunt Anne and Henry have refused his help in so many ways, that he knows that they still nourish the old bitterness.' ' I know it ; I always thought that Henry"], [56, "46 VANESSA. was wrong-headed to refuse the offer of coming into his office, and Henry was angry with me for coming here, Eva.' ' I must be doubly dear to you if you have given up Henry for my sake,' said Eva, with a tender embrace. ' Now let us talk of some thing else, or you will be haunted by bad dreams in your first night at home. Let me see your hair, your beautiful golden hair, which wound its coils around my heart on the first day I ever saw you.' ' Silly child !' said Amy smiling, and not unwilling to let down the golden shower of glossy hair, soft and fine as floss silk, which rippled over her shoulders, and far below her waist. Eva toyed and trifled with its untold wealth, until smiles had chased every cloud from Amy's fair face, and her dreams that night were not of the haunting past, but of a bright future opening before her."], [57, "47 CHAPTER IV. ' FRESH FIELDS AND PASTURES NEW.' The two girls spent a long morning among the Bixley shops, and returned to a late luncheon, and to talk over purchases which had opened to Amy a delightful vista of the costumes appropriate to every variety of social gathering which were to take the place of the thin and much-enduring silk dress that was familiar to all the inhabitants of Allerton. They were still in the dining-room when Eva was informed of the arrival of a visitor. ' Leave the parcels here ; John will tell Julia to take them to your room,' said Eva, as Amy was about to retreat upstairs. ' I see a good deal of Lady Cecilia Wray, and should like you to know her ; and besides if I intro-"], [58, "48 VANESSA. duce you to her now, there will be one stranger less at our dinner-party, for she is to be one of the guests. Never mind about your hair ; it is much smoother than mine.' And Eva cut short further remonstrance by slipping her hand within her cousin's arm, as she opened the door into the drawing-room. Lady Cecilia Wray, a fair full-blown lady of forty or thereabouts, greeted Eva with the utmost effusion. ' My dear Eva ! I am ashamed to call so early, but I wished to catch you before you went out. Of course you know that Mr. Wray and I are charmed to accept your invitation to dinner, and I venture to ask whether your table is full, or if we may bring Lord Alan Rae. You re member my nephew, who spent six weeks with us last summer ; he is coming on Tuesday, and I should not like to leave him on the very first evening.' ' I am sure that it will give papa great"], [59, "FRESH FIELDS AND PASTURES NEW.' 49 pleasure to see Lord Alan Rae,' said Eva, as soon as Lady Cecilia's profuse explanations admitted of a reply, 'now I want to introduce another Miss Mertoun to you \u2014 my cousin Amy, who has come to live with me.' Lady Cecilia received Amy with all polite ness, but her overflowing cordiality was still reserved for Eva. ' Any addition to our little circle is welcome, and I hope my dear Eva, that you will say the same as far as my nephew is concerned, or have you quite forgotten Alan ? ' ' I have not forgotten him,' said Eva, with a slight degree of agitation which did not escape her cousin's notice ; ' I did not know that he was expected at the Hollies.' ' He has been at home all the winter,' said Lady Cecilia ; ' a sad home it is for him, poor fellow, now that my brother's health is sailing, and poor Macrae, the eldest son, is in a melancholy state. His head was affected vol. 1. E"], [60, "50 VANESSA. by some accident he had as a boy, and I fear that his mind is incurably weakened. Lady Raeburn writes that Alan's happy temper has cheered them all, but they feel that he really needs some relaxation, and now that he is coming south, I daresay that he will stay until the grouse shooting begins. I should like to show you Alan's letter, but I am afraid that I have left it at home. He says that it will give him such pleasure to renew his acquaintance with our neighbours here, since he has the happiest recollection of last summer's visit.' ' What a strange woman to go into all these family details,' remarked Amy, when Lady Cecilia had taken leave. ' It is Lady Cecilia's way,' replied Eva : ' and our plebeian natures are rather gratified by such condescending frankness. She imagines that the eyes of all the world are fixed on the noble house of Rae, and she"], [61, "'FRESH FIELDS A\"ND PASTURES NEW.' \"J-J seldom goes through an evening without re marking that she has not forfeited her maiden name, although, as she belongs to one of the oldest Scotch families, and her husband is only a Berkshire squire, it is merely a coinci dence in sound.' ' She seems to be very fond of you, Eva.' ' Rather too fond.' rejoined Eva, with a little moue expressive of dissatisfaction : ' she took me up vehemently when I came out a year ago, and I am always expecting her to let me down again with a run ; but as she is the great lady of Bixley and the neighbour hood, Papa is flattered, and it has been impossible to avoid the intimacy. She is really good-natured, and amusing for a limited time.' ' And what is Lord Alan like ? ' ' How shall I tell you ? He is not like his aunt, nor like people in general.

It appeared that even in a house of which the machinery was as Avell oiled as that of Leasowes, the giving of dinner-parties was attended by considerable anxiety and trouble. Eva's finer instincts recoiled from any ostentation of wealth, but she was obliged to defer to her father's will on this point, and to submit to him the menu of the dinner, with all its details of lighting and service, to satisfy him that all was arranged on one harmonious scale of costly splendour. ' I think there was a Roman Emperor who chose to dine on nightingales' tongues,' said Eva, as she sate down to her writing-table to order some delicacy from Covent Garden which was not yet in season : ' I consider that sort of thing barbaric and out of taste, and it vexes me that Papa does not see it in the"], [63, "FRESH FIELDS AND PASTURES NEW.' 53 same light. If it is necessary to attract fine people by a display of expensive luxuries, in which they would not dream of indulging in their own houses, they had better not come at all. When I lunch with Lady Cecilia, she does not apologise for sitting down to two or three lukewarm slices off the servants' joint, but, if she comes here, Papa thinks that three or four entrees at a guinea each are indispen sable.' Amy assented softly, not caring to provoke an argument, but in her heart she was disposed to think that such palpable proofs of Mr. Mertoun's great wealth were not deserving of Eva's indignant protest. The important evening arrived, and it seemed doubly important to Amy, since she was conscious of being perfectly well dressed for the first time in her life. The Wray party was not the first to arrive, and since Amy was already engaged in conversation"], [64, "54 VANESSA. with Sir John HaAvthorne, who was to take her in to dinner, they were seated at the table before she had leisure to make her observations. Lord Alan had taken Eva down and was now conversing with her, but without much animation. He was a tall, fair young man, as fair as Dennis O'Brien, but, as Amy had no hesitation in admitting, he was far more regularly handsome, although there Avas an unsettled, vacillating expression in his eyes, which might be accounted a defect. Lady Cecilia had taken entire possession of Mr. Mertoun, and he listened with a certain grim complacency to her extravagant commendation of everything which came under her notice, from the pate's aux homards to the blaze of white azalea which filled the conservatory at the lower end of the room. ' And that dpergne ! I am sure that I trace Eva's dainty hand in its exquisite arrangement.'"], [65, "FRESH FIELDS AND PASTURES NEAV. 55 ' No,' said Mr. Mertoun, ' I think that my niece must take credit for that. Is it not so, Amy?' ' I helped Eva a little : she seemed tired this afternoon,' said Amy. ' She looks pale,' remarked Lady Cecilia, glancing down the room. ' I do not say ill, for that transparent pallor becomes her. But you must take care of her, Mr. Mertoun.' ' The advice is scarcely needed, Lady Cecilia ; since she was an hour old she has been my first thought in the morning, and my last at night. Perhaps I have been over-anxious, and have fostered her natural delicacy.' ' Nothing is more deceptive than the appearance of delicacy,' observed Lady Cecilia; 'people tell me that I am the picture of health, and yet I scarcely know what it is to feel really well. You must not be too anxious about dear Eva, Mr. Mertoun ; let"], [66, "56 VANESSA. her have plenty os fresh air and amusement, avoiding excitement and late hours. I Avant her to come over and spend a long day at the Hollies, \u2014 Eva and Miss Amy Mertoun,' she added with a polite afterthought ; ' do say that you can spare them.' ' Settle it with Eva,' said Mr. Mertoun, ' I am always out between breakfast and dinner, and the girls can please themselves.' Sir John here engaged Amy's attention, and the rest of the dialogue was lost to her. Amy was conscious that she contributed little to the general entertainment, for her secluded life had prevented her from acquiring the ease of good society, and Sir John's well chosen topics languished and died, in spite of his unremitting efforts to prolong their exist ence. Amy felt discouraged and ashamed of her own stupidity, and had yet to learn that even dulness may be forgiven in a perfectly"], [67, "FRESH FIELDS AND PASTURES NEW.' 57 beautiful woman. It was a knowledge Avhich she acquired a little later. There were other lady guests, but Lady Cecilia continued to be the central figure Avhen they adjourned to the drawing-room. Eva sought in vain to distribute her atten- tions, for Lady Cecilia was resolved to talk to her, and to her only, and the rest of the party sat round to listen and be edified. ' My dear little hostess,' she said, ' I must take a lesson from you in the art of dinner- giving. The only alloy to my pleasure in coming here to-night is the prospect of hear- ing Mr. Wray's critical remarks on our homely fare and inferior appointments. I find it impossible to get a really good cook to stay with us in the country, but your chef de ctiisine is worth a king's ransom. And the blaze of colour in your conservatory surpasses anything I have seen at this time of year.'"], [68, "58 VANESSA. ' You should reserve your compliments for Papa,' said Eva, ' such things are in his department, and I am only the little lay figure Avhom it pleases him to set up at the head of his household.' ' Even as a lay figure you excel,' said Lady Cecilia : ' considering the absurd fashions which are now in vogue, it requires the courage of an artistic taste to dress your hair in that simple and becoming manner.' This last and more direct attack was too much for Eva's endurance. ' Do please, Lady Cecilia,' she said in a Ioav voice, ' leave my poor little person alone, and help me to bridge over this dull interval. Do you think that I may play something ? ' Lady Cecilia first applauded the sugges tion, and then the performance, and Eva gained so far by her move to the piano, that her irrepressible friend turned to Lady Hawthorne, and talked of instead of to her."], [69, "FRESH FIELDS AND PASTURES NEW.' 59 The gentlemen soon came in, and Lord Alan offered to relieve Amy of the task of turning over the leaves of her cousin's music book. She retreated into the recess behind the piano, and was thus a silent listener to the dialogue which followed. ' Play something else, Miss Mertoun,' said Lord Alan as Eva struck the last chords of a passage Avhich she had played with consider able taste and execution, ' something noisy, under cover of which we can talk.' ' Will this suit you ? ' said Eva, beginning a fresh movement with a smile and a height ened colour. ' Anything will suit me which does not draw off your attention. Music is a fine thing for promoting conversation ; observe the fresh buzz of talk which has begun with your new piece. ' I knoAv ; of all social absurdities drawing-"], [70, "60 VANESSA. room music is the most gratuitously absurd,' said Eva. ' Something may be said for it, as for other abuses,' replied Lord Alan; 'just now, for instance, it serves for a buhvark between us and the company at large. How dull we were at dinner ! ' ' I was tired, and yet I do not think that the dulness was altogether my fault,' said Eva. ' It Avas altogether mine, or shall I say my Aunt Cecilia's. Her exuberant energies absorb the vital forces of those with whom she comes in contact, leaving my spirit altogether arid ; but under cover of your music the sponge is removed, and I am myself again. And how are you, Miss Mertoun ? Life seems to go on here just as if I had never been away, \u2014 is it this summer or last ? Try to enlighten my bewildered senses."], [71, "' FRESH FIELDS AND PASTURES NEW.' 61 ' We do not change much in Bixley, Lord Alan. In one respect there is a pleasant change, however ; I want to introduce you to my cousin Amy.' The introduction was made,- and Lord Alan seemed quite as willing to talk lively nonsense to one cousin as to the other. Amy showed no readiness in reply, but her diffident blushes gave a new charm to her beauty, and, when Lady Cecilia came to declare that she must order the carriage, since Mr. Wray disliked late hours, Eva, who had been playing rather plaintive airs while the other two talked together, was not sorry that the conference broke up. An early day was fixed for the girls to drive over to the Hollies, and when Lord Alan said that he should take care to make no other engagement for that day, the words were spoken to Amy. ' A very successful evening,' remarked"], [72, "62 VANESSA. Mr. Mfcrtoun, who lost no time in lighting 'his bed-room candle as soon as the last carriage had driven off; 'Lady Cecilia is a guest who always ensures enough of talk.' ' Enough, or too much,' remarked Eva, as she followed her cousin upstairs with lagging steps ; ' I am so utterly tired, Amy, that I will not come to your room to-night, lest I should be tempted to linger. We can talk over our guests to-morrow.' When the morrow came, however, Eva did not seem to be more disposed to be communicative, at least so far as Lord Alan Rae was concerned."], [73, "63 CHAPTER V. CRUMPLED ROSE-LEAVES. Amy had not the pen of a ready writer, and although she wrote to her mother with dutiful regularity, the bold statement that she was very happy, and that Eva and her Uncle Richard were kindness itself, left a good deal to the imagination. Helen declared that she should have made better use of her oppor tunities, if she had had anything more ex citing to record than the number of skirts and mantles which she had stitched in the ma- chine for the local draper, by whom she was regularly supplied with work, or the scraps of classical learning which she acquired in help ing her brother Richard to prepare his school lessons."], [74, "64 VANESSA. ' The rank and fashion of Allerton are provided with summer finery,' Helen said one morning to her mother : ' Mr. Benson (the draper before mentioned) says that he shall g-ive me nothing- else to do for a fort night, when he must begin to think of the autumn fashions. I am going to indulge myself with a morning's work over Mrs. Somerville's physical geography. Did I tell you that Dennis lent me the book before he went away, promising to correct my notes from it, which I am to send by post. This makes me less dismally sure that all chance of my liberal education has departed with him.' ' I wish that I could afford to give you the advantages you hanker after,' said Mrs. Mertoun. ' You need not wish it, mother,' said Helen, brightly : ' if I had been set up with the stock-in-trade of an accomplished young lady,"], [75, "CRUMPLED ROSE-LEAVES. 65 I should most likely have been as idle and desultory as my neighbours. Look at Dick, who has been in school for five hours a day since he Avas eight years old, and the only problem he cares to solve is how to distribute an ounce of thought through a pound of work. All the knowledge which I try to infuse falls off in beautiful round drops, like water off a duck's back, and I do really think that boys are stupider and more frivolous than girls, always excepting Dennis O'Brien. I wonder how Dennis is getting on at Bixley.' ' We shall hear next week : Henry intends to spend next Sunday with him,' said Mrs. Mertoun, and Helen took a lively interest in the intelligence. ' I am glad of that : Ave shall hear Avhether Dennis has encountered Amy, and what came of it, and I suppose that Henry will see Amy herself.' ' He will call at Leasowes, if his uncle vol. 1.

The return of post brought a budget from LeasoAves. Richard Mertoun Avrote to invite his nephew to join their Sunday dinner, and to bring- his friend with him if he liked : Eva enclosed a note for Mrs. Mertoun, entreating her to allow Helen to accompany her brother to Bixley, that she might spend the Sunday with them, and take home a report of Amy's well-being, and there was also a letter from Amy herself to the same effect, which con tained a token of sisterly affection in the form of a pair of double-button kid gloves. ' Only look !' said Helen, displaying the gift with a laugh of honest amusement ; ' this"], [77, "67 CRUMPLED ROSE-LEAVES. little fact speaks volumes, and I interpret it thus. Amy means to say, Come if you like, but do not bring me to discredit by coming in thread gloves. If she had sent me the three and sixpence in stamps, she knoAvs that I should have been sorely tempted to spend the money in muffins and sardines, that Dick might invite a friend to tea on Saturday evening. Even while Helen disclaimed the possi bility of rising to the proper level of Lea sowes gentility, it was evident that the prospect of such a break in her monotonous life was attractive, and the motive urged by Eva of bringing back a report of Amy weighed with Mrs. Mertoun. ' It is of no use trusting to Henry's account of her,' she said, ' a man never sees the things which we really care to know.' ' Besides,' added Henry, ' I shall not have much time to bestow on such researches. F a"], [78, "68 VANESSA. My visit is to Dennis, and I certainly shall not desert him to dine at Leasowes.' ' You Avill call there, however,' said Mrs. Mertoun. ' Oh yes, I Avill call, and I think it is quite right that Helen should go there. Eva Avrites a nice, affectionate note, and, since there is no excuse to make, we ought not to vex her by declining the invitation.' Thus then the matter was arranged, and on the following Saturday the brother and sister set out for Bixley. Mr. Mertoun's carriag-e Avas not sent for them in this in stance, and they travelled second class by a circuitous route, yet Helen enjoyed the journey, and was especially pleased to find Dennis O'Brien Avaiting for them on the platform at Bixley. He greeted them warmly, but when Henry wondered Avhether Helen could find her OAvn way to Leasowes, he said in a cold and constrained voice :"], [79, "69 CRUMPLED ROSE-LEAVES. ' She will not have to do so ; Mr. Mertoun's carriage is waiting outside.' They passed out of the gate, and there in fact was the light, open carriage, Avith Amy leaning back in it, looking prettier than ever in her light summer toilette. It Avas easy to understand why she had not gone on the platform ; for when Dennis emerged from the doorway, and she leaned fonvard with an eager determination to be recognised, he looked straight before him and walked past the carriage, to stand some paces off while Henry greeted one sister and put the other into the carriage. He lost no time in rejoin ing his friend and they walked off, arm-in arm, while the sisters were Avhirled on through the streets of Bixley. ' Dennis O'Brien is really too childish and absurd,' said Amy, quite startled out of her usual placidity of manner : ' this is not the first time I have passed him in the carriage,"], [80, "70 A'ANESSA. and he has always refused to see me. Two or three of our country neighbours have made his acquaintance, and it will be awkward and annoying to meet him at their houses while he is in this irrational humour.' ' Awkward indeed ! ' rejoined Helen, who Avas fuming with indignation at O'Brien's wrongs, but Amy Avas too much absorbed in the sense of her own injuries to notice to which side her sympathy Avas given. ' I must try to speak to Henry about it to-morrow,' she continued ; ' he may be able to convince Dennis of the folly and injustice of placing me in this uncomfortable position.' ' I doubt whether you will get much satis faction out of Henry. Do not let us talk of Dennis noAv, since it is a subject on which we can neve*- agree. How nice you look, Amy !

' Perhaps the tie is closer than that of sisters in general,' said Helen, Avho had not got all the satisfaction she desired out of that relationship. ' Eva said the same thing in her letter to mother. It was good of her to ask me here, and I have come chiefly to please the mother who Avants so much to hear of you, but it is an extravagance which may not be repeated, even if you keep -me in kid gloves. Admire the shapely appearance of my hands ! I began to work my fingers into the trammels of civilisation when I reached the Bixley junction, in order that I might display them to you in unsullied glory.' Amy smiled at the thought that if Dennis O'Brien were destined to be the crumpled rose-leaf in her lot, any annoyance he might cause her was cheaply purchased by her immunity from such sordid economies. She"], [82, "72 VANESSA. laid a disapproving singer on Helen's neck-tie, the only article of her dress, with the excep tion of the gloves aforesaid, which bore any appearance of newness, and asked, ' Where did you buy that gaudy thing ? It goes very ill with your dress.' ' I did not buy it at all, Amy : it was an offering of esteem and regard from Mr. Benson, Avhen I went about my last lot of work. I had an impression that it Avas rather vulgar, but as he assured me it was a sweet, genteel thing, I could not hurt his feelings by declining the gift.' ' At all events you might keep it for Allerton church; you will not meet Mr. Benson here.' ' That is true,' said Helen, as she took off the obnoxious ribbon and slipped it into her pocket ; ' you see how amenable I am, but you must not be too critical of my manners and appearance, or I shall become still more"], [83, "CRUMPLED ROSE-LEAVES. 73 awkward than I am by nature. Is not this Swiss cottage which has broken out in chimnies the lodge to Leasowes ? please put my bonnet straight while I compose myself into a becoming attitude of lady-like ease, and assume my very properest behaviour.' Helen's bantering tone, combined with the discomposure excited by O'Brien's behaviour, had ruffled Amy's gentle temper, and when the two sisters entered the drawing--room they were constrained and ill- at ease ; so that Eva thought that the kindest thing she could do was to suggest that they should adjourn to Amy's room to finish their talk, and then join her on the lawn, to drink tea under the limes.

' I do not suppose that I shall have the opportunity,' replied Helen. ' You will probably see him at the station when you go aAvay on Monday, and I shall not be there, as Henry will be sure to take the early train.' ' And if I do see him, what am I to say \u2014 that you made a mistake in casting him off and only want to be asked again ? ' ' I call that extreme impertinence,' said Amy* Avith unwonted heat : ' he has no right to cut me, because I decline to see him as my lover.

I did say that as we should live in such different sets we must not expect to meet, but as it happens we are likely to do so. Mr. Wray, who is a scientific man, and interested in the Museum, has taken a fancy to him, and I know that he is invited to a croquet at the Hollies this week. And if Lady Cecilia and Mr. Wray take him up, he will be asked everywhere.' ' So you wish me to tell him to avoid such complications by keeping away.

But if it is likely to do him any harm, I have no objection to try to set matters straight between you, although I Avarn you that you could not have chosen a worse g-o-between.' The concession, Avhich was not graciously made, was really gratefully received, and Amy was glad to let the conversation drift from a subject on Avhich the sisters' vieAvs differed so widely. ' You like a romance, Helen, and may be introduced to one in real life to-morrow.

Lady Cecilia's anxiety to bring about the match is only too apparent, and I believe that may hold Lord Alan back.' ' Do you call that a romance, Amy ? I should call it a commercial transaction, since Eva's fortune is the equivalent for a peerage. Her noble lover will expect an extra ten thousand pounds if he discovers that another Miss Mertoun is journeyAvoman to the draper of Allerton.' ' Your habit of turning everything into ridicule is very unsatisfactory,' said Amy. ' I thought that you would be interested in what so nearly concerns Eva's happiness, for she is evidently very much attached to him.' ' I beg your pardon, and Eva's,' replied"], [88, "78 VANESSA. Helen, 'but you said nothing about the attachment in the first instance, and I was so uplifted by the idea of being cousin to a live Marchioness that I could think of nothing else.' ' Tea is brought out on the laAvn,' said Amy shortly, and neither of the girls were unAvilling to rejoin Eva there. The sweet sights and sounds of the May afternoon exer cised their due influence on Helen's cynical spirit and she flitted from the garden to the conservatory, amazing Eva by the quickness with which she named the species of rare flowers Avhich she had never seen, or had seen only in illustrations, and she was still more astonished Avhen Helen mentioned Dennis O'Brien as the authority for some of her botanical statements.

' Then I hope that Henry may bring him here to-morrow,' said Eva, ' Mr. Wray and Lord Alan both say that he is charming.' ' He certainly will not come here,' said Helen bluntly, and then, looking up with a sudden perception of Amy's embarrassment, she wandered off into the conservatory, leav ing her sister to explain the matter if she chose. Eva, incapable of interpreting it to Amy's disadvantage, was already prepared Avith an explanation.

THE BEETLE-HUNT. Helen found the evening at LeasoAves long, and she believed that the Sunday Avhich was to follow might be yet more tedious. She regarded the visit as a thing to be done, and to talk of afterwards ; but she doubted whether it would bear repetition, on other grounds besides those of economy. Intercourse with Amy could only bring home to her the fact that their lives were drifting further asunder, and her sister's complicated relations Avith Dennis O'Brien must continue to be a source of irritation. Nor could Helen look forward to the delivery of her sister's message to Dennis Avith any satisfaction, believing that he might resent her intervention as an im- VOL. I.

When Sunday came, Helen found that she was to drive into Bixley for morning service, with her sister and cousin. She was too much dismayed by the critical glances which her uncle Richard darted at her from under his shaggy eyebrows to propose to walk with him ; and it did not occur to the other two girls that she despised the advantage of coming into church cool and fresh, with a toilette unsullied by the dusty road-way. The modern and unsightly parish church was situated in the heart of Bixley, and the Mertoun family occupied a spacious pew in the gallery conspicuous by its fittings and position, and commanding a view of the whole congregation. Even at Allerton Henry and O'Brien had been apt to stray in search of some rural church, and Helen did not there fore expect to see them in such an assembly"], [93, "83 THE BEETLE-HUNT. of middle-class respectability. There were, however, several of Eva's acquaintance with Avhom she exchanged greetings at the conclu sion of the service ; and a tall, fair young man, whom Helen at once divined to be Lord Alan Rae, was waiting; for them at the foot of the gallery stairs. ' Yes, I walked in,' he said, in reply to Eva's inquiries : ' a Sunday Avith one's rela tions is apt to run to length, and I knew that I might depend on your giving me luncheon. It is the only day on which I can find Mr. Mertoun at home.' Mr. Mertoun heard and was not insensible to the implied compliment, and urged Lord Alan to take the vacant place in the carriage. ' Indeed Papa prefers walking : perhaps you would like to walk with him,' said Eva, when Lord Alan appealed to her, and he took the place opposite to her in the carriage without further demur, a fact which had its g 2"], [94, "84 VANESSA. due significance in the eyes of the little Avorld of Bixley. The short drive Avas long enough to modify the democratic bias Avith which Helen was prepared to regard the first live lord Avith whom she had come in contact. His pleasant voice and manner might not have subdued her, but one little speech went straight to her heart. ' There is the Museum, in which I spent a most agreeable hour yesterday Avith the neAv curator \u2014 a great contrast to poor old Jenkins Avho used to potter over his curiosities with shaking hands, and if I asked a question out of the beaten track he only stared at me Avith his lack-lustre eyes.

Lady Cecilia is bent on securing him for her croquet on Wednesday, but he would not pledge himself to come.' ' I hope that I shall soon make his ac quaintance, even if we do not meet at the Hollies,' said Eva ; and Helen, who had been on the point of proclaiming her prior friend ship, understood her cousin's guarded tone, and held her peace. After luncheon, Mr. Mertoun retreated into his own room, to look over the miscellaneous correspondence which was not allowed to interfere with the more regular business of office hours, since it was reserved as an occupation for Sunday afternoons. The servant came in to know if the carriage would be wanted again, and Eva Avas not unwilling to be told that she looked tired, and had better not think of going to the afternoon service. They stepped out- to sit in the verandah, and Amy was considering"], [96, "86 VANESSA. the expediency of withdraAving herself and Helen to some other part of the laAvn, Avhen Henry Mertoun, who had just been ushered into the draAving-room, came out through the open windoAv to join them. Eva would have sent for her father, but Henry interposed to prevent the summons. ' Do n t disturb my uncle now, Eva, as I intend to pay my visit later in the afternoon. I have only looked in to see whether Helen would like to join our walk. Dennis says,' he continued, addressing his sister, ' that he has found some famous hunting grounds for beetles, to which he wishes to introduce you. ' The very thing I was wishing for ! ' exclaimed Helen, joyously starting to her feet : ' I will run up to get ready, and will not keep you waiting half a minute, Henry.' And her expeditious movements made the interval which Dennis O'Brien had been"], [97, "87 THE BEETLE-HUNT. forced to employ in pacing up and down outside the lodge gates as brief as possible. ' That was the most heavenly idea of yours, Dennis,' said Helen, with a renewed burst of exultation ; ' I am sure that I need not give Henry the credit of it ; and I should have been stifled if I had been doomed to sit there, all the afternoon and evening, with my company manners on. ' The suggestion was not wholly dis interested,' replied O'Brien : ' Mertoun has little toleration for what he profanely calls bug-hunting, and it is a pursuit which is much better carried on in partnership.

' The life there is just what I imagined,' she replied : ' Eva is very gentle and nice, and Uncle Richard is certainly more agree able in his OAvn house, although still rather alarming.' And here Helen paused, un willing to wound Dennis by filling in the family group Avith any account of Amy. ' Go on, Helen,' said Dennis, looking at her keenly : ' I am less thin-skinned than you imagine, and you will not hurt my feelings.' ' Then,' said Helen, who was ever rash of speech, ' I think I ought to tell you that you have hurt Amy's feelings. She cannot understand why you have cut her.' ' Is she so dull of comprehension ? I am following her injunctions to the letter.' ' Then perhaps you have mistaken the"], [99, "89 THE BEETLE-HUNT. spirit. I am charged to tell you that you ought not to keep out of her way, nor refuse to recognize her as a former acquaintance. There, \u2014 I have delivered my message with Homeric accuracy, and do not want to hear any more of it. It is no affair of mine.' Both the young men laughed, and it was evident that if disappointment still rankled in O'Brien's breast he was resolved that it should not crush him. His buoyancy of spirit was sustained by the success he had already achieved ; and he talked hopefully of the future, and of the encouragement given him by Mr. Wray. He spoke of Lord Alan with less enthusiasm, declaring him to be agreeable, but dilettante and superficial. 'You are ungrateful,' said Helen. ' I have met him at Leasowes, and he said many civil things of you.'

' Lord Alan detected your dread of being patronized,' said Helen, 'and hoped that it would not prevent you from accepting Lady Cecilia's invitations. Her name is always coming to the surface at Leasowes, and I wanted to know Avhat she is like.' ' She means to be good-natured, I really believe,' said Dennis, ' but she is as vulgar minded as a lady of quality can be, and often is.' ' You talk as if you had a wide experience of the species,' remarked Henry, sardonically.' ' I admit that I Avas talking at large,' said O'Brien with a laugh : ' we democrats are too apt to fancy* that we know things by intuition.' ' I think that you ought to accept her invitations, however,' continued Henry : ' it would not do to affront Mr. Wray, and"], [101, "THE BEETLE-HUNT. 91 besides, there must be a certain relief in getting beyond the range of Bixley tea parties.' ' When did you adopt the maxims of Mr. Worldly Wiseman, Henry ? ' said Dennis, good-humouredly : ' they have not been your own rule of action. Since I came here, I find that your uncle is in some sort the king of Bixley, and, from what you told me some time ago, I fancy that you had only to hold out your hand to become the heir apparent.' ' I do not regret my decision,' answered Henry: 'there were painful circumstances connected with our early life at Bixley which made my mother unwilling to return to it ; and, although my foot is now on the lowest rung of the ladder, I may work my way up, as my uncle has done before me.' ' I wish that I could transplant you all here however. Do tell your mother how often I think of the happy evenings we have"], [102, "92 VANESSA. passed together, and hoAv happy I should still be in her house, although the glamour of the old days has departed.' ' Is not this a good beetle ground?' said Helen, with a wholesome desire to escape from such allusions. ' I am sure that rotten old stump is Avorth probing.' Dennis took out his knife, and while Henry disposed himself to the comfortable enjoyment of the ' Saturday Review,' with a pipe in his mouth and his back against a tree, his companions set to work to poke and probe, and burrow and potter, Avith an ardour which left no scope for any interest in life except beetles. If Eva had Avitnessed this harmony of tastes, it Avould have confirmed the surmise which she imparted to Amy that after noon. ' Do you know, Amy, that I am not quite so sorry for Mr. O'Brien as I was yesterday. When I saw how Helen's face lighted up at the prospect of walking with"], [103, "THE BEETLE-HUNT. 93 him, it occurred to me that he might be induced to console himself.' 'With Helen? there can be nothing less likely,' said Amy, slightly injured by* the suggestion : ' there is a sort of tutor and pupil bond betAveen them, and Helen is much more of a schoolboy than a woman. At all events she is not the woman whom Dennis O'Brien will ever love.' Amy's tone of positive assurance enabled her cousin's lively imagination to take a leap in a different direction, and she began to sus pect that Amy's rejection of Mr. O'Brien had not been final. It Avas an inference which Eva was the more ready to draw, since her peace of mind had been disturbed that after noon by a nameless fear lest Lord Alan's evident admiration for Amy's beauty might further unsettle his wavering allegiance to herself. He undoubtedly appeared less gratified than Amy had intended him to be"], [104, "94 VANESSA. by her declaration that she must go into the house to Avrite some letters, leaving him and Eva on the lawn. Lord Alan's eyes followed her retreating figure and a sudden pang impelled Eva to ask , ' Do you admire my cousin's beauty as much as I do ? ' ' I suppose that every one must admire her. In her own style she is almost faultless,' said Lord Alan. Eva saintly hoped that a less faultless style of beauty might win favour in his eyes, but Lord Alan did not make the most of his opportunities that afternoon. He observed that his five miles walk had made him lazy, and readily acquiesced in the suggestion that they might sit more comfortably indoors. If, however, he had been swayed by a desire for further contemplation of Amy's beauty, he was again baffled, since Amy had retreated to her own room, and was at that moment"], [105, "THE BEETLE-HUNT. 95 in the enjoyment of the peaceful slumber which seemed to her the legitimate reward of Sunday morning's attendance at church \u2014 a slumber undisturbed by recollections of the lovers' Avalks among the lanes and flowery coppices, which had given a charm to bygone Sundays. Lord Alan looked at his watch and ob- served that he had a long walk before him, and that he must get back to the Hollies in time to rest and cool before dinner. ' We shall meet on Wednesday at latest \u2014 sooner if I can devise an errand into Bixley,' he said as he took leave of Eva, and his smile, and the pressure of his hand, made her heart throb Avith pleasure which seemed to her ill grounded when she was left alone to think over the matter. She knew how it Avas with herself, but the hunger of her heart after a solution of the old, old question was as yet unsatisfied \u2014 seemed at this moment further"], [106, "96 VANESSA. from satisfaction than before. A year ago there had been no such questionings, and she had given away her heart without a doubt that her affection was requited. A girl of seventeen, still unused to attentions of Avhich she had since received her full share, she had abandoned herself to a dream of happiness ; and Avhen, after a few short weeks of intimacy, Lord Alan went aAvay, and made no sign, she awoke from it to feel that she had been mis- led by a too susceptible vanity to misconstrue his 'transient admiration. Some secret tears had been shed, some bitter moments of shame and humiliation had been lived doAvn, and she resolved to think of him no more ; but Lady Cecilia's influence had been exerted to keep the interest alive in her heart, and, when Lord Alan himself appeared once more on the scene, all her resolutions were scattered to the winds. She could not give him up Avhile a hope remained, but she Avas determined to"], [107, "THE BEETLE-HUNT. 97 be guarded, and to rely only on facts as proof of his sentiments, and the fact which at this moment stared her in the face was, that he had deliberately thrown away the opportunity of spending a precious hour alone with her. When Amy came downstairs, refreshed by her nap and prepared to enjoy the afternoon cup of tea, she Avas too discreet to express any surprise at finding Eva alone. Mr. Mertoun also emerged from his den, and almost imme diately afterwards Helen and her brother re turned from their walk \u2014 Helen still radiant with pleasure, while her dusty and travel worn appearance revealed traces of the after noon's occupation, and her healthy appetite for the slices of brown bread and butter threatened to interfere with her enjoyment of the dinner which was to folloAv.

' It is a fault on the right side at any rate, and he does not take after his father, Avho made a point of never doing anything for himself which he could get other people to do for him.' Eva Avas more disposed to resent Henry's determination to stand aloof, for she under stood the strength of her father's desire to see one of his own name succeed to the busi ness which it had been the labour of his life to create, and it seemed to her a noble and legitimate ambition.

He has learned nothing for the last six months.' ' I doubt it too,' answered Henry ; ' it is of no use to pour more into a vessel than it will hold, and Dick's vessel is of small capacity. But a boy of fifteen cannot earn a livelihood, and if I were to take him from school, he would only loaf about the streets.'

If he went to Bixley Ave might consign him to Dennis, who would employ his leisure hours in the mounting of beetles and other innocent pastimes.' ' You ride your hobby hard when you make a moral engine of bug-hunting,' said Henry with a laugh which was readily echoed by his sister.

'Scheme as you please, Helen; but there is no need to make up our minds unless Uncle Richard makes a bond fide offer to take the boy into his office.' ' Eva says that the offer will not be made unless he is sure that it will be accepted. The fact is,' continued Helen, with the tendency to moralize which is apt to pervade conversation as we approach the small hours of the night, ' the fact is that the Mertouns are a thin-skinned family, and we must respect his little feelings as well as our own. Taken all together, I do not admire the"], [115, "CONFIDENCES. 105 family peculiarities of hardness and touchi ness Avhich stamp the race.

I will talk to my mother about it to-morrow.' There was no Avant of filial duty in the tacit assumption that the matter Avas already decided, for Mrs. Mertoun, prematurely aged by a struggling life of anxieties and privations, had for some time resigned the reins to her grave, resolute son, who Avas ready to think as well as to act for her, and before whose living presence the shadoAvy authority of her dead husband must inevitably Avane.

The Leasowes household was meanwhile agitated by* a discussion which bore no reference to Dick's future career. It was on the evening preceding the day of Lady Cecilia's croquet-party that Mr. Mertoun came home to dinner silent and preoccupied ; but he was so often immersed in the cares of business that the girls scarcely noticed his abstraction, and, when bed-time came, Amy went up alone, Eva lingering as she Avas apt to do for a few last words with her father. When she came upstairs, after a longer interval than usual, Amy did not observe that there was anything amiss until Eva"], [118, "108 VANESSA. broke doAvn in the attempt to reply to some trivial remark, and burst into a flood of tears.

'It is nothing, nothing really : I was flurried by what Papa said,' replied Eva at last Amy's unromantic imagination instantly conjectured that some commercial disaster had involved her uncle in ruin, and she said breathlessly, ' Must you also exchange riches for poverty ?

' I do not doubt that Lady Cecilia is in earnest. She has said so much of the necessity of Lord Alan's marrying well that I cannot pre tend to be in doubt as to her motive. And if he is in debt, as Papa says, he might be driven to make me an offer, but not because he loves me as I want to be loved.' And Eva hid her face, Avith a moan of plaintive despair. Since Avords of comfort sailed, Amy tried to soothe her by gesture, laying her cool finger tips on her cousin's throbbing temples. The contrast in their moods impelled Eva to speak again.

' I Avill help you all I can,' said Amy ; and she prevailed on Eva to go to bed, and only left her Avhen she declared, in the piteous tone of a child exhausted by a storm of passion, that she would rather be alone and in the dark. Amy went to her room, and sat up late, thinking over the unreasonable pre judices which induced Mr. Mertoun to thwart Eva's cherished hopes : she could see nothing in Lord Alan's gay and self-possessed manner to justify the fear of hereditary in sanity, and she accepted Lady Cecilia's"], [123, "CONFIDENCES. 113 adjustment \"of the scales Avhen she balanced Lord Alan's noble birth against Eva's fortune. The combination of the two seemed to Amy* to make up the sum of earthly happiness. The morning brought some further ex planation of Mr. Mertoun's views. The maid who brought Amy her hot water in formed her that her master hoped that she would be able to speak a word Avith him before breakfast, and Amy dressed in haste and repaired to her uncle's study. ' Have you seen Eva this morning ?' he inquired anxiously. ' Not this morning, Uncle Richard : I Avas Avith her last night.' ' I thought that I heard you both moving about late. Of course she told you what I said to her, since girls always like to talk over their love affairs, real or imaginary.' 'Yes, Uncle Richard,' said Amy timidly. VOL.

' And this affair I take to be imaginary,' continued Richard Mertoun, bending his keen grey eyes on Amy Avith a searching glance. ' I suppose that she told me all the truth, when she assured me that there Avas no engagement, nor even a tacit understanding between them.' ' I think that Eva was most pained by the discovery that people were gossipping about her,' said Amy : ' she never mentioned Lord Alan to me until last night, and then she said that she did not believe that he really cared for her.' 'She is so shrinking and sensitive,' said Mr. Mertoun : ' I have not been able to sleep all night for thinking how much I had wounded her, and yet it is evident that the warning was not given too soon. Nothing could induce me to let her marry into the Rae family : I know"], [125, "CONFIDENCES. 115 from those who are Avell informed that there has been a taint in the blood for many generations, and that Avhile the Avomen do not turn out badly, the men are nearly all vicious or insane.

'She is a good child,' replied the father, tenderly : ' I still hope that I am more to her than any handsome young lord Avho may have tried to turn her head with a few soft sayings, without making any deep impression on her heart.

You may be able to do more than I can to detach Lord Alan and ward off a declaration by which Eva would be unreasonably distressed. I do not enter into particulars, since you must be guided by circumstances as they arise.' 'Yes, Uncle Richard,' said Amy, a little perplexed by instructions which Avere of so vague a nature. How was she to aid in the process of ' detachment,' and had the slight tokens of Lord Alan's admiration for herself, which had sent a pang through Eva's bosom,"], [127, "CONFIDENCES. 117 been noticed by other eyes ? Amy had no leisure to solve this question at once, and could only resolve to follow her uncle's advice in one particular, and to be guided by circum stances."], [128, "118 VANESSA. CHAPTER VIII. BUTTERFLY-HUNTING. Eva and her cousin set out on their drive to the Hollies a little late, and yet not late enough to provoke any special comment by the tardiness of their arrival. The two girls were dressed alike, in rather fanciful Watteau costumes, which gave piquancy to Amy's beauty, and pointed her resemblance to a porcelain shepherdess ; but in Eva's case the effect was less successful : it may have been ill suited to her style of beauty, or only have been marred by her sad and anxious heart, but in any case the contrast between the cousins left all the advantage on Amy's side. It Avas Eva hoAvever whom Lady Cecilia Avelcomed Avith gracious distinction."], [129, "BUTTERFLY-HUNTING. 119 ' My dear Eva ! as each carriage drew up, I trusted that it was yours. Alan was quite in despair at having to begin a game without you, as he said that you promised to be here early, and at last we arranged that Mr. Wray should hold your mallet.' ' Perhaps you will allow my cousin to play instead of me,' said Eva : ' I have a headache which made me doubtful about coming at all, and I cannot do more than sit in the shade with you.' Lady Cecilia could only assent, but when she took Amy across the turf to join the knot of players, she had a different arrangement to suggest : ' Eva Mertoun cannot play, Alan,' she said in a Ioav voice to her nephew, ' would you like to give up your mallet to her cousin ?' ' As Miss Amy Mertoun pleases,' said Lord Alan politely, ' but I know that my uncle is dying to be released.'"], [130, "120 VANESSA. While Amy protested that she Avould rather look on than interfere Avith the game, another of the players turned tOAvards her. It Avas Dennis O'Brien, and, while Amy changed colour, he bowed with the distant coolness of a slight acquaintance. ' Hoav do you do, Miss Mertoun,' he said quietly ; ' I need scarcely say that you do me no favour in taking my mallet. You know of old that I am no croquet player.' There Avas nothing in the words to strike the ear of strangers, but they made Amy's heart beat Avith unruly vehemence which rendered her perfectly incapable of reply. She took the mallet from O'Brien's hand Avithout a Avord, angry with her own want of presence of mind and Avith her former lover's stinging indifference, but a little consoled by Lord Alan's undisguised satisfaction in the arrangement Avhich made Amy his partner in the game. Mr. Wray, who had only con-"], [131, "BUTTERFLY-HUNTING. 121 sented to play on the understanding that he should give way to the first comer, was less gratified by the unceremonious haste with Avhich Dennis escaped from his proposal to make a fresh transfer, and he took up his mallet again Avith an air of melancholy resigna tion, prepared to become once more the object of his young lady partner's withering scorn, as he frustrated all her policy by his blundering strokes. It Avas one of the occasions on which Mr. Wray was unable to free himself from the role assigned to him among many of his acquaintance, of being only Lady- Cecilia's husband, although his individuality Avas fully recognized in the set of scientific men with Avhom he preferred to associate. Amy could not at once respond with spirit to Lord Alan's efforts to interest her in the game. The meeting with Dennis had passed off well, and his guarded manner and cool politeness Avere exactly what she had herself"], [132, "122 VANESSA. prescribed, but the readiness Avith Avhich he had followed the prescription was not flatter ing to her self-esteem, and she felt that it was due to herself to evince equal indifference by replying to Lord Alan's soft sayings Avith a beAvitching gentleness of manner AA'hich had its due effect in rivetting the chains in Avhich her beauty had already begun to enthrall his fickle affections. Mr. Mertoun could scarcely have anticipated such prompt and efficient co-operation when he invoked her aid in the work of ' detachment,' and Eva Avatched the process Avith a sore and SAvelling heart. To Lady* Cecilia also it appeared that her ela borately planned croquet-party Avould prove an unprofitable investment, and she flitted about in restless dissatisfaction, as impatient of the protracted game as Mr. Wray himself ; and more deeply injured Avhen Lord Alan and Amy disappeared at its conclusion down a"], [133, "BUTTERFLY-HUNTING. 123 grass alley, from which they only emerged again late in the afternoon. Lord Alan then came up to address Eva for the first time since her arrival : ' I hope that you are feeling better, Miss Mertoun ; I am so grieved to hear that you are suffering from headache. Your cousin missed a good deal of lively excitement in not being able to join our game,' he added, appealing to Amy. ' Amy plays a better game than I do,' said Eva, simply ; and it may have been only her cousin's uneasy conscience which detected any double meaning in the remark. ' She played remarkably well,' said Lord Alan, ' and we were both exhausted Avith our exertions, and glad to sit doAvn and rest among the ferns. I think you knoAv the place, Miss Mertoun?' ' The fernery ? yes, I knoAv it well,' replied Eva. She too had spent a long after-"], [134, "124 VANESSA. noon in its refreshing shade, Avith Lord Alan by* her side, just a year ago. ' I am afraid that the tea and coffee are both cold : perhaps you would prefer an ice ?' said Lady Cecilia, turning stiffly to Amy. ' Let me send for a cup of hot coffee, Miss Mertoun,' said Lord Alan, eagerly bending forAvard : ' it is my fault that we are so late. Unless, indeed, you prefer an ice ? ' ' Indeed, I do,' said Amy, looking prettier than ever through her diffident blushes, and it is not given to every woman to blush be comingly. But, as Lady Cecilia remarked to her friends, there was no soul in such pink and white prettiness. She was one of the large-bodied Avomen who love to talk of the soul. Eva had not been left entirely on Lady Ce cilia's hands that afternoon, for Dennis O'Brien was introduced to her and they had some talk together. His eyes, as well as Eva's,"], [135, "BUTTERFLY-HUNTING. 125 followed the croquet-players persistently, and a vague desire to ascertain the true nature of his relations to Amy prompted Eva's remark : ' I think, Mr. O'Brien, you knew my cousin at Allerton ? ' ' I knoAv them all,' said Dennis : ' Henry is my great friend, and our intimacy made me almost one of the family. I miss the home life in my lodgings at Bixley.' ' Helen said that they missed you at Allerton,' said Eva : ' what an odd, clever girl she is, quite unlike girls in general.' ' I am partly responsible for her singularity,' said Dennis : ' it has been pleasant to teach anyone of so much originality and poAver of research, yet I do not altogether plume myself on the result. She might distinguish herself as a man, but I doubt Avhether she will be a popular or agreeable woman.' The critical tone of this remark convinced Eva that Helen was still, as Amy had said,"], [136, "126 VANESSA. only a schoolboy in his eyes, and she ven tured on the further observation : ' The two sisters are very unlike.' ' Unlike indeed,' said Dennis emphatically, ' and not only in externals. But I knoAv them too Avell to discuss their peculiarities.' It Avas at this juncture that Mr. Wray came up to congratulate himself on his tardy release from the servitude of croquet, Avhich entitled him to carry off O'Brien to look over his collection of fossils, and Eva Avas left to discover that Lord Alan did not shoAv the like eag;erness to make amends for the time he had lost in the fulfilment of his social duties. She had honestly intended to satisfy her father by discouraging his attentions, but this could not diminish the bitterness of the admission that no discouragement was necessary. Eva Avas among the first to order her carriage, and Avhen Lord Alan protested against such an early departure, his remonstrances were point-"], [137, "BUTTERFLA'-HUNTING. 127 edly addressed to Amy. It was to her also that the remark Avas made, that he should soon have occasion to go to Bixley and that he would take Leasowes on the way. Mr. Wray took Eva to the carriage and Lord Alan folloAved, not too closely, with Amy ; indeed there were a feAv moments' delay, to be explained by the freshly gathered bunch of tea-roses which he left in Amy's lap after she was seated in the carriage. They had passed through the lodge gates before silence Avas broken by either of the girls ; and Eva leaned back in her corner of the carriage and closed her eyes, perhaps to keep back the tears which were ready to fall. At last Amy ventured to take her hand, and to say softly : ' Is your head very bad, dear Eva?' ' Not very bad, Amy, but a headache sometimes serves as a convenient excuse when one is out of heart or temper.' There"], [138, "128 A'ANESSA. Avas another silence, and then Eva added : ' If Papa had been here to-day, he would have been satisfied that the gossips of Bixley had mistaken the object of Lord Alan's attentions. Is it not so, Amy ? ' ' Indeed, Eva, I could not help it.' ' I suppose not. You can no more help being lovely and lovable than I can help being sought only for my father's money. We shall not quarrel, even about this, Amy : to-morrow and for all days to come I mean to be reasonable.' Amy kissed her cousin, and wisely held her peace : it Avas in order to hide her OAvn embarrassment that she played with the roses in her lap, whilst Eva, in the unreasoning anguish of a tortured heart, was ready to ascribe the unconscious action to her desire to flaunt such proofs of favour in the eyes of her slighted rival. The other actor in this little drama did not escape a severer criticism. Lady Cecilia"], [139, "BUTTERFLY-HUNTING. 129 had spent more money than she could afford on her garden party, regarding it as an in vestment of capital which Avas to produce a speedy return in the shape of her nepheAv's engagement to Eva Mertoun, and she was naturally indignant at the signal failure of all her schemes. When the last visitor had driven off, and Mr. Wray had retreated to the peaceful seclusion of his OAvn room, for the half hour which still remained before dinner, Lord Alan discovered that he was not to be left to the same repose. He took up a news paper, but Lady* Cecilia was too angry and too much in earnest to be diverted from her object. ' I know hoAv much latitude young men alloAv themselves, Alan, but, even according to their lax code, I imagine that it is in bad taste to flirt Avith a pair of cousins who stand almost in the relation of sisters to each other.' ' What an alarming prelude, Aunt Cecilia ! VOL. I. K"], [140, "130 VANESSA. Pray go on Avith your lecture,' said Alan, Avith a lazy good-humour Avhich did not modify his aunt's displeasure. ' I really hoped, Alan, that you were in earnest this time, and that you Avould make a marriage in every way suitable and satis factory.' ' The accusation takes a different form. I hold flirtation to be one of the pleasing pre liminaries to marriage.' ' Ahvays supposing that you flirt with the right person. You know, Alan, that I have given you every facility for making Eva Mertoun's acquaintance. She is a thoroughly nice lady-like girl, and the more you know the better you will like her. Last summer you paid her great attention, and now, just as all the neighbourhood is aware of the fact, you slight her in the most glaring manner for a girl Avhom you saw for the first time ten"], [141, "BUTTERFLY-HUNTING. 131 days ago. I should like to knoAv what your intentions really are.' ' I thought that it was only the heavy father of genteel comedy who asked a man about his intentions,' said Lord Alan, suppressing a yawn. ' However, I have no objection to tell you that I was rather taken with your lovely young heiress a year ago. There was a naturalness and piquancy about her manner Avhich I found refreshing, and, if she had come on instead of going off, and also if you had flaunted her money-bags less persistently in my face, I might have drifted into matrimony. But the fates are against it, the rich cousin has become sickly and spiritless, and the poor one is lovely and bewitching, and I have no \" intentions,\" except that I intend my three months' visit here to be as agreeable as possible.' ' Your levity is incorrigible,' said Lady K 2"], [142, "132 VANESSA. Cecilia, and she pondered hoAv the three months' visit could be curtailed. It was true that she had urged her nepheAv to come up from Scotland, and to stay at the Hollies until the grouse-shooting began ; but he had manifestly- accepted the invitation on false pretences, if, instead of courting an heiress, he employed his time in an idle flirtation Avith her penniless cousin. She broke ground that evening by suggesting to Mr. Wray the expediency of leaving home for a time, but his reply was vague and discouraging. Since his conjugal felicity was not perfect, he preferred to remain at home Avhere the presence of a third person blunted the edge of those sharp sayings Avhich Avere apt to be exchanged in a domestic tete- a-tete. He said that he Avas Avriting a treatise, Avhich made it impossible for him to separate from the contents of his library, but that if Lady Cecilia thought that she could afford it, she might take a run up to London, and he"], [143, "BUTTERFLY-HUNTING. 133 and Alan would keep house together. Lady Cecilia deplored the selfish apathy of man kind, and was constrained to cast about for some other means of breaking off Lord Alan's unprofitable pursuit of Amy Mertoun. The account of the garden party at the Hollies Avill scarcely be complete Avithout the comment furnished by the following note from Dennis O'Brien : ' My dear Helen, ' Herewith I return your notes on Somer ville, interlined Avith unsparing criticism, Avhich I sum up in the advice that you should avoid tall English and study compression of style.

' Yours truly, ' Dennis O'Brien.'"], [145, "T -\u25a0 t CHAPTER IX. ' THE LITTLE RIFT.' Lady Cecilia's croquet served as a starting point for other gaieties in the neighbourhood, and the hot June days which folloAved were occupied by a succession of garden parties. Eva was as reasonable as she had engaged to be. She accepted each invitation as it came without demur, although she knew that Lord Alan Rae must be among the invited guests, and Avas almost equally confident that he Avould distinguish Amy by his exclusive attention. Amy's passive manner seemed to endure, rather than to invite, his admiration ; and, ex cept for one or two signs, knoAvn only to themselves, the affectionate relations between the cousins appeared to be unchanged."], [146, "136 A'ANESSA. There was a change, hoAvever, to be felt rather than described. They no longer lingered in each other's rooms at bed-time. There were no more Avhispered Avords, and the playful sayings, which bespeak perfect confidence, vanished before the smooth politeness Avhich acts as the veneer of mutual constraint. Amy felt that her position Avas insecure, and that if at any time the strain on Eva's endurance became too severe, a Avord to her father might reveal the estrang-ement, and procure her exile from Leasowes and a return to the sordid round of cares at Allerton from Avhich she had so recently escaped. Such a possibility struck upon her heart Avith a chill of dismay, and, since marriage offered the only certain escape from it, Amy could not rise to the pitch of heroism implied in any serious discouragement of Lord Alan's addresses. She told herself that, even if she forbore to snatch the prize, it Avould not be"], [147, "' THE LITTLE RIFT. 137 more Avithin Eva's grasp, since she had ac cepted her father's decision as irrevocable. That the prize itself might not be Avorth snatching, did not enter into her calculations. Mr. Mertoun's objections to the match were ascribed by her to his characteristic reluctance to trust his daughter's happiness to any keep ing but his own, and to the natural propensity of mankind to rake up frivolous accusations against those who are raised above the common herd by their rank or noble qualities. The fact still remained that Lord Alan Avas of noble birth, and Amy's craving for material enjoyment was gratified by the thought that she should enter a sphere where all was har mony and brightness. Besides, she liked Lord Alan for himself, though not perhaps Avith the same Avarmth with Avhich she had once liked, or loved, Dennis O'Brien. That sentiment still lingered in her breast, and the gentle deference of Lord Alan's manner did"], [148, "138 A'ANESSA. not even noAv aAvaken the same conflicting emotions Avhich never failed to be aroused by the feAv cold and ceremonious words Avhich Dennis exchanged Avith her when they chanced to meet. Amy considered that this was only due to the uneasy feeling of shame Avith which Ave ever look back to a dead folly, and that the grateful esteem and regard Avith Avhich she Avas prepared to devote herself to Lord Alan's happiness were better calculated to outAvear the union of a life-time. While Amy thus arrayed the reasons in favour of accepting the offer of Lord Alan's hand, those Avho knew him most intimately doubted Avhether the offer Avould be ever made. His friends argued that, since Eva's Avealth had failed to allure him into repairing the broken fortunes of his family by marriage, he Avas still less likely to be in earnest in his present suit ; and it was chiefly from a dis interested Avish to spare Amy's peace of"], [149, "THE LITTLE RIFT. 139 mind, and possibly Avith the afterthought that her nepheAv might resume his more serious courtship of Eva if his relations Avith her were uncomplicated by this additional proof of inconstancy, that Lady Cecilia applied her energies to the task of diverting- Lord Alan O o from his new pursuit. She had failed in her efforts to remove him from the neighbour hood ; but there Avas another mode of effect ing her purpose, and it was with this object in view that she drove into Bixley one after noon, and, calling at Mr. Mertoun's office, she sent in her card to inquire Avhether he was at leisure and would allow her to come up for a feAv minutes. But one ansAver could be given to such a message, and Mr. Mertoun, after the involuntary ejaculation, ' What does the woman Avant ? ' sent out a polite request to Lady Cecilia to walk upstairs. He received her stiffly, anticipating an appeal in"], [150, "140 VANESSA. Lord Alan's favour, and her opening speech did not dissipate this belies. ' It is so good of you, Mr. Mertoun, to alloAv me to take you by storm in this way. I am really ashamed to trespass upon your valuable time, but the interest I take in your dear Eva must be my excuse.' ' Eva is infinitely obliged to you,' said Mr. Mertoun, drily. ' Once before,' resumed Lady Cecilia, blandly unconscious of his repelling manner, ' I ventured to call your attention to Eva's fragile looks. A Avoman's eye is quick to notice any signs of delicacy, and you will excuse my apparent officiousness in the case of a motherless girl.' ' Eva ahvays looks delicate,' said Mr. Mertoun, disclaiming almost fiercely the secret anxiety by Avhich he Avas constantly consumed, ' and the great heat Ave have had lately is trying to her.'"], [151, "' THE LITTLE RIFT.' 141 ' Exactly so,' replied Lady Cecilia ; ' our inland summers are ahvays relaxing. At the sea-side it is different, and it occurred* to me that a change of air is all that is needed to restore Eva's strength and tone. I know that it is difficult for you to leave home, but since she has her cousin's companionship, the tAvo girls could go to some quiet sea-side place together.' ' It is not a bad suggestion,' said Mr. Mertoun, after pausing a moment to consider whether it could be prompted by any motive but that which lay on the surface. ' As you say, Amy might go Avith her, and I Avould run down for a Sunday ; but since I have no partner, I cannot be aAvay from my business for many days at a time.' ' I Avould gladly take Eva to the sea-side myself,' said Lady Cecilia, ' but Mr. Wray never likes to leave home ; and besides, it Avould throw out my nephew's plans, since he"], [152, "A'ANESSA. 142 has arranged to stay with us for another six Aveeks.' Lady Cecilia imparted this last piece of information in an ingenuous tone which dis armed all Mr. Mertoun's suspicions. In urging Eva's removal from the neighbour hood while Lord Alan continued to reside at the Hollies, she proved that she had relin quished any scheme she had entertained of promoting the intimacy, if indeed Mr. Mertoun had not Avronged her in such a belief. His brow cleared, and he said Avith real friendliness, 'It is very good of you, Lady Cecilia, to take such an interest in my little girl. I am less at home than I could Avish, and it is true that I might not be the first to notice any failure of health or spirits. I Avill talk over the matter with her and Amy when I go home this evening, and I Avill send them off to Swanage if I see any* occasion for it.'"], [153, "' THE LITTLE RIFT. 143 Lady Cecilia Avould not trespass any longer on Mr. Mertoun's valuable time, and took leave of him, satisfied that she had set the stone rolling and that her nephew would be deprived of the pastime in which he had chosen to employ the long summer days. Eva's sad eyes brightened Avhen her father came home prepared with his scheme for sending- her from home. There is no tread mill more Avearisome than the round of gaieties Avhich demand a smile upon the lips when the spirits are flagging and the heart is sore ; and to escape from such servitude to the little watering-place, Avhere she might be as silent and unsocial as she pleased, was a Avelcome prospect. But the ' little rift' which severed her from her cousin was sloAvly widen ing, and she could not endure the thought of constant and close companionship, when there would be no third person present to lessen the constraint. ' If you can get on"], [154, "144 VANESSA. without us, papa,' she said, ' I really think that a month at Swanage would do me good, but it Avould be dull for Amy unless I may ask Helen to come Avith us.

I know from Mr. O'Brien, even more than from Avhat Amy has told me, hoAv hard- Avorked she is at home.' ' Settle it as you like,' said Mr. Mertoun, not altogether pleased, ' I see that you are determined that I shall adopt the whole family. Here is young Richard coming into the office next week, and I suppose that you Avill soon find niches for the rest. I can see the attraction to a pretty, sensible girl like Amy, but this other sister has always appeared to me singularly deficient in outAvard graces.'

' And Avhat trouble do you anticipate ? ' said Mr. Mertoun, looking at her keenly. ' Nothing very serious,' said Eva, smiling, ' but there are times Avhen my head aches and my limbs tremble, and Avhen the trouble of living seems almost too great.' ' A girl's nervous ' fancies ; you certainly want chang-e of air,' said Mr. Mertoun hurriedly. ' And you may take Helen if you like.

' There is nothine so detestable as sea-side gaieties. The days may be too glaring for us to go out much, but I shall enjoy the long summer evenings on the shore, and the release from housekeeping cares, and the privilege of wearing shabby clothes. I hope that you will not dislike it very much.' ' Of course not, Eva, I think it will be delightful,' said Amy, not with enthusiasm.

If it Avould bore Uncle Richard, of course I would much rather be with you,' said Amy. The sugges tion of even a temporary return to Allerton, seemed to her sensitive imagination to imply a threat of her eternal exile from LeasoAves and all its advantages, and nothing; short of unconditional submission might save her from such a fate. She declared herself as ready to go to Swanage as to promote the scheme of adding Helen to her party, although there was in fact little in the note Avhich she appended to Eva's letter on the subject, beyond an expression of self-gratulation over the benefits which the benign influence of her presence at Leasowes had procured for the other members of her family."], [159, "149 CHAPTER X.

There Avas a flagged patlnvay up to the front door, Avhich Avas not opened once in six Aveeks, and a back entrance through the farm and poultry yard into the tiled kitchen, in which Miss Charlton pottered about of a morning, much more at home than she appeared to be in the loAv-broAved parlour to which she used to adjourn to receive her afternoon visitors.

She kept house for her brother George, Avho Avas several years younger than herself, and had still an air of youth and comeliness about him. He Avas reputed to be Avealthy, but their style of living was more in keeping Avith the customs of a bygone gene ration than Avith modern notions. They kept only two indoor servants, and Avould have thought it an unjustifiable extravagance to eat meat Avhich had not been killed on the farm : but the consumption of beef and ale was great on all festive occasions, and George Charlton paid aAvay a large sum in weekly Avages to men Avhose chief claim to his service lay in the fact that they* were too old or in firm to obtain Avork elseAvhere, and that their fathers and grandfathers had Avorked on the estate before them."], [165, "Helen's holiday. 155 Amy had always attempted to ignore the acquaintance of Miss Charlton and her brother, Avhom she designated as ' Helen's friends,' but she had not been insensible to the material advantages it offered in the frequent tokens of regard Avhich were so often left at the door Avith Mr. Charlton's respectful compliments \u2014 the little loin of dairy-fed pork, the delicious cream cheeses, the fragrant strawberries or russet apples Avhich followed in due succession. Since Amy's removal to Leasowes, intercourse with the inhabitants of the Manor Farm had been less restricted, and Miss Charlton Avas on sufficiently un- ceremonious terms to invade Helen's retreat, tapping lightly at the door Avhen her long visit to Mrs. Mertoun came to an end.

' Your visits ahvay*s do her a Avorld of good, Miss Charlton.

' I am sure that George would be flattered to hear you say so, though he Avould not approve of your taste. He is a great admirer of your beautiful sister, and indeed it is quite a tender subject with him.

' I hope that you will include SAvanage in the programme,' Helen said, more in jest than earnest, and she Avas surprised by Henry's ready reply, that he should like to explore the Isle of Purbeck unless Dennis Avere averse to the idea. Helen began to suspect that the bitterness with Avhich Henry had hitherto regarded his uncle Richard Avas modified by the interest he had begun to feel in his pale, gentle cousin.

Here the talk became technical, but it insensibly drifted back to matters of human interest.

' Then people talk nonsense, as they usually do. Amy herself told me, not a month ago, that Lord Alan Avishes to marry EA*a.' Before O'Brien could declare his reasons for a different belief, the discussion Avas cut short by the appearance of Lord Alan him self, Avho had just entered the room.

Although the meal Avas over Eva Avaited for her in the dining-room, but Lord Alan and Amy had gone out to play croquet at the shady end of the garden.

' Besides,' added Helen, ' Henry Avill come back Avith us to-morrow night, and stay here as long as Dennis is at Corse Castle."], [197, "187 THE BUTTERFLY-NET.

Eva has already described the limits of your morning stroll, and cart-ropes Avill not draAV me out before breakfast. But we Avill go together to bespeak my bed at the inn, and then perhaps walk up to the best point of vieAv for the sunset.' Henry set out Avith both his sisters, but Amy Avas not prepared to accompany him even for this limited distance ; and, as they retraced their steps from the inn, she declared her intention of turning on to the Avooden jetty to await the arrival of the Poole"], [198, "188 VANESSA. steamer. 'Such a misguided thing to do,' remarked Helen, as she and her brother ascended the hill ; ' Amy takes the deepest interest in the arrival of that steamer, Avhich she considers to be our only link with the civilised Avorld.' Helen spoke at random and Avith no prevision of the links in Avhich passing events were even noAv Avelding the chain of Amy's fate.

These Avere the objects Avhich first met Amy's view, and she regarded them Avith a languid amusement Avhich Avas lost in a very different feeling Avhen she caught sight of a tall, fair young man, in a yachting dress, who Avas crossing the gangway. Their eyes met, on his side Avith a smile of animated pleasure, on hers Avith a blush of rosy red, and before his foot touched the pier Amy had turned avvay with an instinctive desire not to court recognition. She had gone but a few paces before she became conscious that Lord Alan Avas by her side. ' Do you run away from me ? ' he asked, in a low breathless voice.

' I began to think that you Avould not come at all,' said Amy, no longer attempting to conceal the fact that she had in truth watched and Avaited for him.

' Surely you can plead a headache, fear of the heat \u2014 anything that Avill procure us the happiness of spending some happy hours in each other's society, umvatched by curious and grudging eyes. Or is such a prospect distasteful ? ' ' Not distasteful,' said Amy, and her increasing embarrassment gave courage to Lord Alan's importunity."], [202, "192 VANESSA. 'In all my arrangements, my one thought has been Iioav to give you pleasure, and you are the only being whom I care to see on board the \" Vanessa.\" I shall come ashore in the boat at ten to-morrow*, and shall hope to find you on the south side of the quay. Come in a boating dress, for if the day be favourable you need not be afraid to take a short cruise.' ' I am not afraid of the sea,' said Amy. ' Still less, I hope, of me,' rejoined Lord Alan, in accents of tenderest reproach. The steamboat bell Avas ringing its energetic signal for departure, but he still lingered at the pier gate with Amy's hand fast locked in his. Unwillingly he relinquished his grasp, and Avalked sloAvly aAvay, Avith more than one backward glance, and he was gone before Amy had uttered a syllable of the reply in Avhich she tried, or fancied that she tried, to"], [203, "THE BUTTERFLY-NET. 193 disclaim the possibility of keeping the appointment Lord Alan had made. Amy little thought that the parting, from- Avhich the most uninterested bystander could read something of tender sentiment, had flashed its full meaning; before the indignant eyes of Eva. She had stepped out to make some necessary purchases for to-morrow's pic nic, and Avas passing the gate at the moment. Avhen Lord Alan turned aAvay; she coulinot be mistaken in her cousin, and a second glance- Avas scarcely needed to identify her com panion. Eva turned pale and hurried on, Avhilst Amy retraced her steps to the house, unconscious of the recognition. At the tea-table that evening, when Helen and her brother Avere discussing some point of history in connection Avith Corse Castle^ Amy announced her intention not to join the party.

There is no need to make a mystery of the fact that Dennis and I are not on easy terms together, and our mutual constraint might spoil the pleasure of the rest.' ' Dennis ought to feel flattered by such consideration for his feelings,' remarked Henry, ' and yet I fancy that he might endure some hours in your society Avithout any very acute suffering.' ' Very possibly,' said Amy colouring, ' but still avc may be happier apart, and I shall enjoy a quiet day upon the sands.' ' It is a long day to spend asones said Eva, Avith a stress on the last Avord, intended to mark her sense of her cousin's duplicity ; but the shaft fell short, since Amy Avas still unconscious of the chance which had revealed her stolen interview Avith Lord Alan.

Do let us go, Eva, and enjoy ourselves without any qualms of conscience.' ' My conscience is clear,' said Eva, Avith a peculiar smile, Avhich puzzled Helen, Avhile it altogether escaped Amy's notice. She was satisfied to have the matter arranged Avith so little trouble, and sat Avorking in silence and Avith a pre-occupied mind. Henry talked of Dick's start in the office at Bixley, and Eva was gratified by his frank acknoAvledgment of Mr. Mertoun's great kindness to him. ' The Charltons invited Dick to spend a Sunday Avith us at the farm,' he said, ' and I thought him improved, more manly and intelligent, and interested in his work. He Avent back on Monday to dine at LeasoAves, an invitation by Avhich he Avas flattered, though aAve-struck.'

' ' I suspect that his uncle may be more tolerant of dulness than his sister,' said Eva. ' Very possibly : I knoAv that Henry and I are both intolerant,' replied Helen : ' the truth is, that as Ave do not mix with people to see them as they are, we have leisure to construct the ideal of what they ought to be.' ' A philosophic excuse for fastidiousness,' observed Henry Avith a smile. Helen had never seen her brother in such happy* and natural spirits, and doubted Avhether to ascribe the fact to O'Brien's genial influence, or that the sense of injury which had so long rankled in his breast, embittering his relations with his uncle Richard, Avas effaced by an awakening interest in his cousin. Although sometimes proA*oked by Eva's variable spirits, and her"], [207, "THE BUTTERFLY-NET. 197 fits of languor and depression, the tAvo girls had learned to love each other in the close intimacy of the last three weeks, and Helen found some amusement in Aveaving; a romance betAveen the Romeo and Juliet of the rival houses. At present, hoAvever, the courtship could only be suspected by a very lively* imagination, for Eva was gentle and indif ferent, and Henry's native roughness of manner Avas but little softened in her favour. Although Helen Avas the only one of the party Avho felt any umvillingness to anticipate the usual hour of bedtime, it was Helen again Avho was first Avrapped in sleep. Amy and Eva occupied two little chambers opening into each other, and long after the door of communication had been closed betAveen them, Eva could see the light of her cousin's candle shining under it, and could hear Amy moving softly about. Amy could not, or at all events did not, account to herself for the"], [208, "198 VANESSA. restlessness which prompted her to put all her possessions in perfect order that night. She looked over the contents of her desk and took out a little packet, containing one or two notes from Dennis, and some songs which he had copied for her ; and, as she set a light to the papers in the empty grate, and Avatched the flame die away in a smouldering heap of ashes, Amy felt that she had in truth taken leave of her old life, and Avas prepared to face the suture, which was opening be fore her. When, at last, she Avent to bed she found it possible to sleep peacefully through the grey dawn of the summer's morning, while Eva lay watching it with worn and sleepless eyes, and tried to school # her rebellious heart into the conviction that the friend Avho had betrayed and the lover Avho had deceived her were alike umvorthy of regret."], [209, "199 CHAPTER XIII.

The morning Avas still grey when the young people met again at an early' breakfast, but this, as Henry observed, Avould be an ad vantage for their drive, and he was confident that the clouds Avould clear away, and the sun shine forth to gild the ruins of Corse Castle. While the other tAvo Avere too eager in their preparations to notice that anything Avas amiss, Amy observed that Eva AA*as pale and silent, and followed her upstairs to ask Avhether she were quite fit for the long day's expedition. There Avas a suppressed fierceness in the tone of Eva's reply Avhich Avas strangely at"], [210, "200 VANESSA. variance with her habitual gentleness of man ner. ' Do you really wish me to stay at home, Amy ?' ' O no, dear Eva ; I mean, not on my account,' said Amy, annoyed by the con sciousness of rising colour : ' but I thought you looked ill, and I promised Uncle Richard that I Avould take care of you.' ' I mean to go,' said Eva, shortly, and Amy, conscious of a disinterested motive in her suggestion, and of considerable relief in its rejection, turned into Helen's room with a virtuous sense of her OAvn heroism in having attempted \u2014 and sailed \u2014 to interfere Avith Lord Alan's scheme for their mutual enjoyment. She found Helen in the highest spirits, as. she collected the implements for her day's pleasuring, Avhich included on this occasion a geological hammer and chisel, a tin case for botanical purposes, and a butterfly net and beetle-box. Amy Avished to add a sun-"], [211, "THE CAPTURE. 201 shade to this miscellaneous baggage, but Helen rejected the suggestion Avith scorn. ' For the good of my complexion, Amy ?

You must come Avith us if the party is to Avear any air of distinction, and it is not too late to think better of it.' But Amy considered that it Avas too late, and the carriage drove off Avith out her. When Misbourne came to inquire at Avhat hour she Avould be pleased to dine, Amy replied that she intended to take some bis cuits and spend the day on the beach, and that most probably she should require nothing else until the rest of the party \"returned from Corse Castle. Such Spartan fare was more in accordance with Helen's tastes and habits than Avith her sister's, but Misbourne was on ceremonious terms Avith 'Miss Amy' and"], [212, "202 VANESSA. v made no comment on the fact, and Amy, although she told herself that she had quite made up her mind to decline Lord Alan's proposal of a cruise in his yacht more reso lutely than she had done on the preceding evening, Avent upstairs and exchanged her light summer cambric for a boating dress before she repaired to the beach. She established herself in the shade of a boat near the jetty, but the light and variable wind on Avhich Lord Alan's movements must depend, rendered him more tardy in his appearance, and Amy had leisure for some anxious surmises Avhile she bent over her lace-work, and fancied that the nursery-maids in her neighbourhood Avould guess her mo tive if she scanned the horizon too closely. ToAvards noon, as the Aveather-Avise had predicted, the clouds rolled off, a fresh breeze sprang up, and Amy presently descried the Avhite sails of the ' Vanessa,' as she rounded"], [213, "THE CAPTURE. 203 the point, and glided gracefully into the bay. When the yacht lay to, her boat was manned to bring her oAvner to the shore, and Lord Alan's eager glance soon fell on Amy*, who sat as motionless as if she Avished to elude observation. ' You have not come to meet me this time, Amy,' said he smiling. It Avas the first time that he had dropped the more formal appel lation, and although Amy's Avomanly instinct told her that no explanation had passed between them to justify such an adAance, she ventured on no protest. ' You are prepared for our cruise, I see,' continued Lord Alan, ' and Ave had better go on board at once, while the wind serves for sailing-.' ' I have been thinking,' said Amy, ' that it Avould be better to put off our cruise until to-morroAv, and wander along the cliffs this morning.

' Have I left the Hollies for the pleasure of taking your brother and sister out yachting ? ' said Lord Alan, with a shade of haughtiness in his tone : ' must I say it yet again, Amy ? It is for you, and you alone that all my arrangements Avere made, and since my com pany is distasteful to you, I will go back as I came. The tears stood in Amy's beautiful eyes as she looked up Avith a mute beseeching glance, ready to yield, and yet trembling, as if the full meaning of the step which she Avas about to take daAvned upon her. ' For an hour, or tAvo hours at the most, I will go Avith you,' she faltered, and Alan Rae accepted the concession with gratitude and reneAved tenderness. ' Nay, Amy ; I have frightened you by my hasty Avords.

It AA'as necessary to embark from the pier, and as they passed along it, Amy Avas sen sible that they* Avere a mark for curious glances from the knot of idlers Avho Avere gathered there, after the fashion of sea-side places. It Avas also evident that Lord Alan obsei*ATed and resented the inquisition, and he AAraA*ed off Avith a haughty air the officious help of those Avho Avished to lend a hand in pushing off the boat. Amy breathed more freely Avhen they were not only on board the yacht, but installed in the luxuriously fitted"], [216, "206 VANESSA. and airy cabin in which, as Lord Alan said, she Avould be more comfortable until the noon day heat Avas over ; and yet her composure Avas of short duration, since Lord Alan reclined on the cushions by her side, and Avhispered Avith the assured confidence of an accepted lover : ' Mine noAv, Amy, \u2014 noAv, and for ever.' ' Not Amy,' she faltered, struggling even noAv to express the conviction that it Avas not thus she should be Avooed and Avon. ' And Avhy not Amy \u2014 Bien-aimee \u2014 Amy to me, if to none other in the Avorld beside. I take but Avhat I ask : call me Alan, and the cup of my pleasure will be full.'

' said Dennis, for getting the laws of good-breeding in his fierce anxiety. ' None that I knoAv of,' said Helen, avIio met his troubled eyes with a steady gaze : ' it must be some absurdity of Misbourne's, since she considers herself responsible for our health and morals, and she is ahvays fussy.

While Helen sought to satisfy her own uneasiness as Avell as that of her companion by this explanation, Henry Avas agitated by Eva's surmise as to the true cause of his sister's disappearance.

I will go at once to the pier-head, but I can not, I dare not, tell O'Brien in Avhat direction your fears point. For all his assumption of indifference, such a suspicion would wring his heart.'

If they take their plea sure, why should not we ? ' said Lord Alan, gaily. But when he saAv Amy's eyes fill with tears, he turned aAvay Avith a Avhistle of annoyance, and said that he Avould go and talk to the sailing master. He Avas absent for some minutes, Avhich gave Amy time to recover her composure, and to resolve to be pleased Avith his decree, Avhatever it might be. ' Berridge says that we cannot possibly get back to Swanage to-night,' said he ; ' Avind and tide are both against us, and there is a storm coming up.' ' What are Ave to do ?

If you anticipate trouble in returning to Swanage, let us give up the idea of returning; at all. We will take a maid on board at Portsmouth, Avith everything Avhich is necessary for your comfort, and run across the channel to Cherbourg or Dieppe.'

Amy Avas left alone, feeling a little sea-sick, and very frightened and miserable. As the peals of thunder rolled nearer and one bright flash of lightning; illumined the cabin Avith its lurid glare, her terror became almost uncontrollable, and it Avas in this pitiable state that Lord Alan found her Avhen his services Avere no longer required on deck. He Avished to be tender, but there was a touch of annoyance in his attempts to reassure her. ' Amy, my dear love, look up, and re member that no harm can happen to you Avhilst I am by your side.

' We will go to London, if you Avish it,' he said at last. In the unreasonable state of mind to which Amy's terrors had reduced her, he felt that any attempt to urge her further to entertain his suggestion of remaining on board the yacht might cause a scandal, Avhich he Avished to avoid. He Avas annoyed, and at little pains to conceal his annoyance ; but, Avith the morning light and the facility for escaping the eyes of the Avorld, which could be better attained in a great city than elseAvhere, he felt confident that she Avould acquiesce submissively in Avhatever he might decree,"], [234, "224 VANESSA. and Avhat that decree Avas to be he Avould not now pause to decide. Dennis O'Brien got out of the mail-train at Brockenhurst, and, since the night Avas dark and rainy, and he had travelled in the last carriage, the two shrouded figures Avho hurried into a reserved compartment in the fore-part of the train escaped his notice. He Avent into the office to inquire Avhether any passengers had booked from Lymington or Brockenhurst by this or by the preceding train ; and, since the booking clerk Avas short and surly in his ansAvers, as men are apt to be in the small hours of the night, the train moved on before he obtained the information Avhich he sought. ' A lady and gentleman,' re peated the clerk ; ' hoAv should I knoAv Avhether it were a lady ?

Dennis un clasped the book to turn to the fly-leaf on which, in the happy days of their early acquaintance, he had inscribed Amy's name, and, as he did so, one or two dried flowers fluttered from between the pages. ' Memorials of the walks we have taken together,' observed Dennis, and he was more deeply moved Avhen he turned to the last leaf of the book, on which a discoloured spike of flowers Avas gummed, with the initials D. O. B., and a date inscribed below. ' Look here, Helen; this is a spike of habenaria, the white butterfly orchis, which I picked for her, not five minutes before she told me that all was at an end between us.

' That is to say, your lives might have flowed in the same current, if you had been equally shallow-hearted,' said Helen, with characteristic vehemence. ' No, Dennis, it is better as it is \u2014 better for you, I mean. Amy has acted basely \u2014 I must say it, though she is my own sister \u2014 and not only towards you. Poor Eva is cut to the heart.' Richard Mertoun was equally distressed and shocked by the alteration which he noticed in his daughter when he met her at the Bixley station, two days later. The facts in connection with his niece's elopement had only been reported to him in a mitigated form ; and his first feeling was one of relief, since he did not consider himself responsible for Amy's misconduct, and believed that the ill-advised haste Avith which the marriage had been contracted would convince Eva that his"], [237, "THE WEDDING. 243 objections to Lord Alan Rae were well founded. In fact, he supposed that Eva must be more affected by the loss of her cousin's companionship than by that of her possible lover. 'Why, my dear child,' he said, ' you look worse than when you went away. We must drive round by Popham's, and desire him to come up and see you this evening. ' Oh no, papa,' said Eva earnestly. ' Do not let me be worried about my health, and my appetite, and Dr. Popham's prescrip tions. All that I want is, to be let alone.' Helen had gone on to Allerton by the same train, after promising, not very willingly, to return to Leasowes for a few days, if she found that her mother could spare her. ' Only for a few days,' she stipulated. ' Dennis says that life is made up of failed experi ments, and that the only inexcusable thing is to fail in the same way twice. You made a R 2"], [238, "244 VANESSA. mistake in adopting Amy as a sister, and you shall not do the same thing over again Avith me. ' You have often said that no two sisters have less in common,' said Eva. ' It Avas said before I knew how widely our paths Avere to diverge ; and, as things are at present, I have no poor lover to forsake nor Avill my beauty turn the head of a rich one ; but it Avould not be less fickle to abandon my connection with old Benson and the seAving machine, and to leave our mother to carry on the struggle of life without me. And you need not regret that I- have other Avork to do, Eva, for if I Avere set up on a pinnacle to be worshipped, you Avould soon be ashamed of your uncouth idol.' HoAvever that might be, Eva cried very much Avhen Helen gathered together the bulky marine and geological treasures with which the raihvay carriage Avas littered, and"], [239, "THE AVEDDING. 245 disappeared into the booking-office to vindicate her independence by taking a second-class ticket for the remainder of the journey, instead of availing herself of her cousin's intention to pay her Avay home. .This was another trait which pointed the contrast between the two sisters ; for Eva found herself continually on the verge of giving offence by her habits of lavish liberality, in which Amy had acquiesced almost as a matter of course. The return to Leasowes seemed doubly cheerless, when Helen was no longer by her side to brace her spirits by Avholesome counsel. She was harassed by her father's affectionate solicitude about her health ; and the anticipation of Lady Cecilia's appearance to jar her sensitive nerves by her comments on their mutual injuries loomed like a nightmare in the background. Dr. Popham's . prescrip tions seemed a less evil ; and Eva gave Avay to the lassitude Avhich oppressed her, and"], [240, "246 VANESSA. lay in bed for some days, Avhile Misbourne was instructed to deny to visitors any access to her sick room. Helen had not written to her mother to announce her return ; so that she left her goods at the station and walked through the quiet streets of Allerton to their own house, which she found to be still untenanted. She set out at once for Charlton Manor, enjoying the coolness and verdure of the grass-fields, and the quiet beauties of the inland land scape, but subdued, at once by the parting from Eva and by the prospect of witnessing her mother's distress on Amy's account. ' If it should be my lot to be crossed in love,' she said to herself, ' I hope that I shall bear it more bravely than poor Eva. I will take Dennis as my model of fortitude ; he is neither crushed nor embittered by his dis appointment, and yet no one can say that he is insensible to it.'"], [241, "THE WEDDING. 247 It was late in the afternoon when Helen reached the farm, and the elms which surrounded it threw their long shadows across the grass which the sleek cows were munching with practical, if not with \u00e6sthetic, enjoyment of its dewy fragrance. While Helen hesitated to startle her mother by walking up the flagged pathway, and enter ing the house without preamble, her per plexity was relieved by Mr. George Charlton's appearance from behind the farm buildings. He was very unlike his small, brisk sister in person \u2014 younger by more years than she would have cared to specify, tall and broad-shouldered, deliberate in speech, and with the somewhat bovine cast of features which is not uncommonly acquired by men whose work lies among the fields and pastures of rural England. He advanced to meet Helen with the broadest smile of congratulation. ' Mrs. Mertoun"], [242, "248 VANESSA. will be delighted to see you, and so indeed are Ave all,' he said. ' We have not been able to talk of anything but your sister's great marriage at home, and it was just the same Avhen I Avent into the market yesterday. At first Mrs. Mertoun was a little startled and upset by getting no longer notice of it, but young people must manage matters their own Avay, and the more Ave think of it the better she is pleased. As my sister Anne says, ' Miss Amy's beauty will grace a coronet, and the Marquis of Raeburn cannot fail to be charmed Avith his daughter-in-laAv.' Helen Avas relieved, if a little surprised, to find that her mother had been enabled to vieAv the matter through Miss Charlton's spectacles, and she felt no desire to dispel the illusion. Mrs. Mertoun Avas not in truth quite so free from misgivings as George Charlton represented her to be, and she shed a feAv tears when she had taken Helen to her"], [243, "THE WEDDING. 249 OAvn room, acknowledging that it Avas very sudden, and that Henry was sadly put out and vexed about it. But, she added, Amy's happiness was the chief thing to be con sidered, and, if her lover had insisted on secresy, she must not be too much blamed. There was not much time for private dis cussion on Helen's first arrival, for Miss Charlton Avas hovering about, eager to enforce her welcome by making Helen sit doAvn to the substantial evening meal which was already spread. The cream which had been brought in for tea, rich as it was, was not considered rich enough to do her honour ; and fresh supplies were ordered from the dairy, together with a golden slice of honey comb. Helen was quite ready to do justice to these delicacies, and although she felt like a monster of hypocrisy when she was called upon to describe Lord Alan's noble appear ance, courtly manners, and ardent affection,"], [244, "250 VANESSA. she could abandon herself with the healthy instinct of youth, Avhich disdains to brood over unseen griefs, to the amusement of the moment Avhen the conversation diverged to the wider subject of courtship. 'It is not much you knoAv about it, George, the more's the pity,' said Miss Charlton, Avho believed herself to be SAvayed by a heroic desire to abdicate in favour of a young sister-in-law. ' I got over it early in life,' replied George, with a grim smile ; ' mother cured me of courting when I was only a lad, and I never tried it again.' ' You have kept the matter very close all these years,' rejoined Miss Charlton, ' I never heard a Avord of it.' ' Tell us now,' said Helen ; and though Mr. Charlton coloured and fidgetted, and said that it was nonsense, he did not resist the importunity."], [245, "THE WEDDING. 251 ' I was only a lad,' he repeated, ' and very much taken up with Molly Moggs the dairy- maid, who was six years older than me, and had been keeping company with our carter since they went to Sunday-school together, though I knew nought of it. I came into the milking-house one afternoon, and, never thinking that mother was in the next stall, I came behind Moll as she bent over the milking-pail, took up her face in my two hands, and gave her a smacking kiss. Mother turned sharp round to say that Moll was wasting; her time, Avith her face all aflame when she saw that it was I. There was Moll crying behind her apron, and I stood there like a fool not knowing what to do or say. ' You say that he never served you so before, Moll,' said mother, ' and I'll show you what to do if he ever offers to serve you so again.' She pulled my head down by the hair and gave me such a box"], [246, "252 VANESSA. on the ear as made the sparks fly out of my eyes. I did not think so much of the blow, but it made me mad to see Moll drop her apron and forget her crying, and lay her head against the coav's side to laugh. I locked myself up in my room and Avould not have any supper, and that night I sAA'ung myself out the chamber Avindow into the garden, and ran off, meaning to enlist for a soldier or go to sea. I ran a mile beyond Allerton, and then I remembered that I had gone to the milking-house before I littered doAvn the calves, and that the poor things Avould be crying for their supper all night.' ' And so you Avent back to the farm,' said Helen ; ' that is a delightful conclusion to the idyll. The calf Avhich revived your wavering allegiance to the Manor Farm ought to have been stuffed and put in a glass case.' The homely talk, the country fare,"], [247, "THE AVEDDING. 253 were alike refreshing to her harassed spirits, and she was able to take a more cheerful view of Amy's future when they retired for the night, and it was necessary to discuss the matter with Mrs. Mertoun in all its bearings.
