His claim thus shown \u2014 so far so good \u2014 If't be but rightly understood ; And, that it may bejudg'd aright, He'll show it in a stronger light. But, first, the premature conclusion He bars of pow'rful self-delusion ; Yet, Critics, don't mistake his meaning, And falsely think him over-weening : He but asserts a bold pretence, And pleads as 'twere in 's own defence.

And wherefore should not they who plead Their cause themselves, as well succeed, As they who do their counsel fee, To urge their claim right strenuously, Where force nor fraud can aught avail 'Gainst simple Truth's most simple tale ?

Instead of composing sonnets and madrigals in praise of her beauty, as I have done, I'll write a satire on her manners, and paint the deformity of her mind. Yet I would have an immediate revenge. Why have I been fool enough to follow a haughty capricious woman through all the servility her pride and vanity could put me to? Because 1 have seen her fairer than she is \u2014 ay, and to say the truth, younger too \u2014 She can't be far short of forty; and that in a woman is more than fifty in a man \u2014 I am forty-nine; so, that, in point of years, I have materially the advantage of her. \u2014 'Gad, a thought strikes me.

[Aside.] I'll get myself enter' d of that Society. Sir Val. I am resolved, since she opposes my first en trance into the matrimonial state, to lessen as much as possible her second chance ; and I can't do that more ef fectually, lhan by encouraging all broken-down rakes and unsteady bachelors to remain single, and avoid her lures. Though, now I think of it, I will leave her something : let the first legacy be a shilling to her ladyship, to buy her weeds to repent in. Brief. It shall be done, Sir Valentine, precisely as you desire. I know something of her ladyship myself; and, between you and me, she is no better than she should be. Sir Val. No, faith, you are right there. \u2014 But you don't mean as to her reputation, heh ? Brief. Why, as to that \u2014 Excuse me \u2014 I mustn't circulate stories, or I should lose Ihe few clients I have. Sir Val. Ah, you are a discreet man, Mr. Briefless \u2014 and, I believe, an honest man, though poor and a lawyer. Brief. Else I hadn't been ousted from Westminster Hall for want -of a brief. But an inflexible honesty has spoil'd many a man's fortune beside mine. Sir Val. Very true \u2014 But ah ! Mr. Briefless, though your honesty has kept you poor, your poverty has secured you from far greater evils. Brief. How can that be ? Is not poverty the worst of evils ? Sir Veil. Alas ! no.

O no ; \u2014 nothing more than though a man should build a house to live in, and have it tumbled about his ears by a hurricane. Brief. It cannot surely be so bad as that ? Sir Val. Would it were not. \u2014 [Aside.] I've half a mind to consult him. \u2014 You can be secret?"], [26, "Act I. VALENTINE'S DAY. 24 Brief. Close as fate. Sir Val. Know then \u2014 I am the most unfortunate man that ever paid his court to woman. There is i;ot a lawyer in the land has lost more suits than i have. Brief. [Aside.] Except myself. Sit Val. For these twenty years have I been endeavouring to obtain a wife possessed of some personal attractions; and even when I had gone through all the forms, when I had suffered all the vexations and heart-burnings of a lin gering expectation, some upstart rival, with no other ad vantage over me than a few years, with perhaps a prettier leg, a more delicate complexion, or a finer set of teeth, has carried off my mistress at a day's warning. I have been constantly served thus : every day have seen your impertinent coxcombs, effeminate fops, brazen-faced li bertines, dashing idiots, pretty fellows, and skipping petit-maitres monopolizing favour with the finest women; while I, who have studied Ovid, read all the amatory authors, dived into the very philosophy of the tender passion, and made myself master of the whole art of love, I have been all these years a wooing to no purpose. Brief. Perhaps, Sir Valentine, you have over-acted your part. Women are very apt to slight a man that professes a very violent passion for them. Sir Val. That may be. I have been told that I have a weakness which has marr'd my fortune with every woman I. have addressed ; and that is said to be, a liability to let loose the reins of my imagination, and suffer it to run ,away with me. Brief. Ah! there's the rock men split upon in love affairs. A man should never be in raptures with his mistress, unless she is to be won no other way. Sir Val. I believe you are right. Would I had consulted you befdre. Brief. Why so ? Sir Val. Because I should have saved myself, as well from, the mortification I now sutler, as from innumerable others : because I should have averted the doom that now lixes me an old bachelor for life, after dancing attendance for twenty years at the very door of matrimony.

[Aside.] He's certainly mad. You raise my curiosity, Sir Valentine. What strange event' has hap pened ? Sir Val. O, nothing strange. But you shall hear. \u2014 Pray be seated. [They sit.] You are acquainted with my passion for that Belle Widows that cockatrice, that jilt, that wo man, my Lady Bellecour. We were engaged as partners last night at the public ball, where all the fashion of the place was assembled. We were both in excellent spirits, and I sat by her side paying her all those little attentions which men enamoured shew their mistresses ; when sud denly a general buzz ran through the room, and all eyes were fixed on a dashing blade who had just entered. Pre sently, the whisper went round, \" Sir Harry Dashmore.\" \u2014 Well, my gentleman stood a few seconds, eyeing the com pany through his glass ; then passing along, bowing to some, nodding to others, grinning with self-sufficiency, and staring at all the women as if he meant to stare them out of countenance (though he could not well do that) ; at last, attracted by the widow's appearance, he quickly recognized her, and immediately \u2014 (would you believe it?) they two, regardless of all present, fell to public greetings, laughing aloud, ogling, and giggling, like a couple of idiots met at a fair; while I sat by, stared at by all around, covered with shame, and stifling with indignation. This, however, was but an introduction : for, while they were rattling away, the impudent puppy flung himself into the seat between us, and r-lmost knocked the breath out of my body ; when I, from the effect of the shock, threw my arm, quite unconsciously, over the neck of a fat dowager who sat next to me, and, by the position I was in, seemed actually going to salute the old lady before the whole company, who were all laughing ready to split their sides. As soon as I recovered myself, I rose, [Rises.] and addressed my spark, \u2014 asked him if he were a gentleman? \u2014how he dar'd intrude himself? \u2014 and put a hundred questions to him , which served only to increase the laughter, D"], [28, "Act t VALENTINE'S DAY. 26 and complete mv confusion. At this I was ready to choke with passion, and unable to endure it longer, burst through the crowd, and vanished : but there again, as I pass'd, such a peal of general laughter dinn'd my ears that \u2014 I think I hear it now \u2014 It was like the roaring of an audience in a theatre, at an unexpected broad joke, or a sudden trick of a clown in a pantomime. Brief. Truly, it was an awkward situation- Sir Val. Awkward! I felt myself in purgatory. I could have hang'd myself when I got home. I was half mad, and went to bed in a high fever. Brief. For my part, I wonder what the fools could see to laugh at. Sir Val. Why, fools, if you ask 'em what they laugh at, they can't tell you. But for the widow \u2014 if ever I for give her, may I be the jest of women the remainder of my days, and a public mark for the derision of all laughing idiots! \u2014 How would you advise me to act? Brief. Why, it is usual, on such occasions, to challenge the party. Sir Val. What! challenge a woman ? Brief. No. \u2014 I mean the gentleman. Sir Val. O, hang him. I would be revenged on her. Brief. But you will be expected to call him to account also. Sir^Vat. Ah! there's another evil \u2014 I am not only to be publicly affronted, but am to expose my life because I am an injured man. However, I disapprove of duelling, as being a silly mode of seeking satisfaction. Brief. That's very true. \u2014 But, when a man is publicly affronted, it is necessary to do something to wipe off the disgrace. Now duelling, after the old mode, is certainly a very unpleasant remedy \u2014 very apt to raise qualms and ugly fancies; but there are some modern improvements in the practice which take off all that : so that, like many strong and dangerous medicines, duelling, by the help of art, may now be used, even by women and children, without the least injury to their constitutions. Sir Val. Ay, but 'tis a poltroon's remedy, and I'd rather suffer under the malady, than seek to mitigate its pain by grafting another disease upon it. \u2014 Besides, I would not di vide my revenge \u2014 advise me, therefore, the most effectual way to make it fall the heavier on her. [Sits. Brief. Why, the best revenge a man can take against a"], [29, "Aet I. VALENTINE'S DAY. 27 woman that slights him is to get in favour with another that's handsomer. [Sits. Sir Val. Right. \u2014 But ah! would that I knew-one hand somer! for, spite of our quarrel, I can't deny the widow's personal charms. She has, it must be confessed, the finest eyes, the prettiest mouth, the most delicate chin, the most significant nose, and the handsomest and most commanding forehead you ever saw, united by two blooming cheeks. Brief. But how long will her beauty, such as it is \u2014 for \u2022 you over-rate it much \u2014 how long will it last? \u2014 Consider her age. Sir Val. Why, true \u2014 she must be near forty, though she owns to only thirty, and puts on all the airs, and dresses in all the gay attire of twenty-one. Brief. And if you follow her reckoning she'll not be forty these twenty years. For you never knew a woman, whose age, after thirty , travelled faster than a snail's gallop. Sir Val. True ; yet altogether you shall not look upon a finer woman. Her carriage too has a wonderful dignity and grace. Brief. Oh ! fiddlestick of her .carriage \u2014 you'll make her out a Venus presently. There are handsomer and younger women, in plenty, looking out for husbands. Sir Val. [Eagerly.] Know you any such ? [Rising. Brief. [Rising.] Ay, marry! Tush, Sir Valentine! don't tell me of her eyes, and her nose, and her chin. I'll shew you a picture that shall open your eyes to her imperfec- tions. You have seen her through a false medium \u2014 through your passion. Sir Val. So I have ; I perceive it now ! I have been blind to her imperfections, as though she were the only woman to be seen. Why now, she has got a mole upon her left cheek which I have all along, from mere infatuation, looked upon as a beauty: whereas now, methinks, I see it spoil all her features\u2014I awake out of a dream! \u2014 But I'll be revenged on her, cost me what it may. I'll find out some pretty girl, and marry her instantly, though cuckoldom should stare roe in the face. Do you know any pretty lively maid that sighs to be a fine lady ? Brief. Ay, scores \u2014 the world abounds with 'em.\u2014 But you want a wife that will do you credit in the eye of the world. Sir Val. Yes, if there were any such to be met with\u2014 but that's a forlorn hope. [Sits again- P ?"], [30, "Act 1 VALENTINE'S DAY. 28 Brief. Oh ! don't despair, Sir Valentine.

No, no; you had better let me speak to her guar dian first. He has desired me to look out a husband for her; and if I recommend you, I'm pretty sure he'll not object. Sir Val. Well, go to him immediately, and say all you can for me. Bring him into it, and you may put yourself down for five hundred in my will. Brief. May I ? Sir Val. Yes. Brief.

SCENE II. \u2014 A Room in Gkaspall's House. Enter Sophia, musing, her Hair loose, and her Dress negligent. Sophia. I'm very sad, and have nobody to converse with. This gloomy solitude denies me every comfort. Abroad I might find relief, and strive to banish from my thoughts the image of my faithless love. There I might recover my spirits, and* engage a heart more true ; but here imprisoned I have no relief, nor any hope to rest upon. I hate my guardian, yet want courage to resist his autho rity; for I dread the sound of his voice, and tremble when I look at him. Would I had a friend or companion to share my melancholy, and render this odious solitude less dreary. Oh ! why, my love, why would you desert me? Enter Gkaspall. Grasp. Sophia! my clear, I have news for you \u2014 Come hither \u2014 I have selected a husband for you. Sophia. A husband! Ah, no. I can't have any husband but my Robin, and he, alas ! won't have me. Grasp. Fidulestick o'your Robin \u2014 You must give over this foolish sadness, this whining and pining for a silly bird, and think of a husband. I have provided you a worthy man, a neighbour of ours, Sir Valentine Dangle, Knight: so that you'll be a lady, a lady of quality, child \u2014 think of that. What do you sigh for ? Think of being a lady, I say, and sigh no more. Sir Valentine is a man that has all the experience of age, and all the fire of youth about him; a"], [32, "VALENTINE'S DAY. Act I. 30 man whom all the finest women set their caps at. He has, beside, wit, gallantry, and good breeding, with a fine taste, and a poetical fancy to set him off to the best advantage in a lady's eye. He has one extraordinary quality, too, which you'll admire him for above every thing else : he can talk poetry as well as prose. Sophia. But \u2014 Grasp. Ay, now for your buts \u2014 If he were more than mortal you'd find a but in him \u2014 Well, what is this but? Sophia. I don't know him \u2014 I, I have never seen him\u2014 I, I, I mayn't like him. Grasp. Don't make foolish objections. It is enough that I know him, and that I like him. Not like him in deed ! But you must and shall like him. Don't tell me. Am not I your guardian ? and have n't I authority to pro vide you a husband? and when 1 have engag'd my honour to a gentleman, am I to be exposed to be run through the body because you mayn't like him ? \u2014 Let me hear no more. I expect Sir Valentine here every minute, to throw himself at your feet, with all the transport of an enamoured youth; and I desire you'll give him a handsome recep tion.

Sophia. His love ! dear, how can he love one he has never seen ? Grasp. He has seen you in my report, and fallen in love with your picture. Sophia. [Aside.] Oh, why, my love! why have you de serted me ? Wherefore despise a heart you too easily won? Grasp. [Aside.] I must give her a few instructions, or there will be some embarrassment. \u2014 [To her.] I don't desire that you should return his passion with equal warmth; that would not he proper \u2014 the less you say the better. All I require is, that you listen with due attention to his ad dresses, and assent, in a manner by inference, to every thing he may propose. For example, when he throws himself at your feet, you must gently raise him up, and say he does you too much honour ; when he offers to kiss your hand, or salute your lips, (as he will most likely out of gallantry,) you must suffer him with a sort of passive reluctance; and again, when he praises your beauty,"], [33, "<Act I VALENTINE'S DAY. 31 you should hang your head a little on the off-side, and look ing on the ground, tell him he flatters you.

Sir Valentine, you are welcome\u2014 Pray take a seat. Sir Val. But where's the lady? Grasp. Why you are come too soon for her \u2014 she is dressing.

Ay, whom she loves as devotedly as ever any Juliet loved a Romeo. Sir Val. O, fiddlestick ! \u2014 She may be fond of it, but you don't mean to she is actually in love with it. Grasp. Yes, I do\u2014 over head and ears. Isn't she Brief less. Brief. It is indeed not less true than strange. Sir Val. Oh, pugh! you jest \u2014 you are laughing at me. Grasp. I am serious \u2014 she is actually in a sighing and dying state \u2014 Is she not Briefless ? Sir Val. Amazing ! what bird is it ? Grasp. A Robin-red-breast. SirVal. A Robin-red-breast! Death! have I lived all these years to be rival'd at last by a little Robin-red-breast ? Ah, SirVal ! SirVal ! this is your old luck \u2014 woo whom you may, it's just the same.

Grasp. [Aside.] He's quite crack'd. \u2014 [To Briefless.] Tell him the bird is flown. Brief. Compose yourself, Sir Valentine. You need not fear little Robin, for, poor thing, 'tis flown. Sir Val. [Starts up.] Ha ! Is it flown \u2014 say you? Grasp. Yes, and Sophia grieves after it\u2014 that's all. Sir Val.

Ay, many people have made the same mistake. Sir Val. Oh, I'm charm'd ! to think I shall have a wife that can sing like a nightingale. But does she pine much after her Robin ? Grasp. So much that she does nothing all day but mope, and sigh, and walk about the house, like a poor solitary house-lamb. Once, indeed, lately I caught her composing verses- Sir Val. Ha , indeed ! Is she inclin'd to poetry ? Then she's mine \u2014 I've won her already. Oh! if she have a poetical fancy, never fear but I'll stir it to some purpose. I never yet had a mistress that could write verses herself, or that knew how to appreciate mine. But I am afraid you over charge her picture. Brief. That were impossible. Indeed it is hardly pos sible to do her justice. You are not yet half informed of her excellencies : she has one super-excellent quality, which doubles the value of all her other charms. Sir Val.

Why, to describe it negatively, she wants both the will and the power to utter noisy sounds ; so that whoever marries her may tune his ears to harmony before hand. Sir Val. She isn't dumb, I hope? Brief. Oh, no. Grasp. He means, she wants that secret spring, that volatile self-moving principle, which everlastingly, with most women, pulls the rope connected with their clappers; and though she is but seventeen (an age which is reckoned the spring-tide of female passion), when she does speak, her tongue is governed not by passion, but by reason. Sir Val. Then she's a wonder. I don't think there's her match in Europe. Oh ! she's the very maid I have been sighing for these twenty years. \u2014 But is she more than ordinarily handsome? Grasp. Ask Briefless \u2014 he's a better judge than I am. Brief. Truly, Sir Valentine, to do her justice, and to speak poetically, she ought to be the burning of another Troy. Sir Val. I'm all on fire at the thought \u2014 But egad, you ought to have left that for me to say when I see her \u2014 Well, but where is she all this time? I burn with impatience to behold her \u2014 perhaps, too, she waits to be introduced. Do, Mr. Graspall, endeavour to shorten the time that so delays my happiness. Grasp. I'll see after her \u2014 she must be dressed by this time. Sir Val. Tell her she needs no ornament \u2014 that I have eyes only to behold her charms. Grasp. I will. \u2014 Mr. Briefless, I believe I shall not want you any more at present. [Exit. SirVal. Briefless, give me your hand. If I win the lady, you shall not wait till I die for your reward. You are a very honest fellow, and I'll make your fortune for you, I will. Brief. You are very kind, Sir Valentine, and over-rate my services. Sir Val. Not at all. If honest services were properly rewarded, honest men would not be so rare in the world. Brief. That's very true.

Capt. Ridiculous! I'm afraid, uncle, there's some defect in your vision, that makes your fancy the stronger ; for I observe, you bestow the same praises on this new beauty as you have been won't to bestow on your favourite widow, whose sun is going down. Sir Val. Truly, I have been under a delusion, with respect to the widow \u2014 that's certain: and having found out that I have been worshipping a false idol, I turn my devotions to the true divinity, \u2014 the rising sun..

Faith, she does love me ; she is handsome as I speak her; and she is wise withal : ergo, I am not an old fel low; and if any man dispute it, I'll run him through the body to convince him. That she loves me is certain : for though she did'n't tell me so in words, she expressed it so unreservedly, so languishingly, with her all-speaking eyes, that a single word would have marr'd the beauty of the confession.

Capt. Ha, ha ha ! \u2014 Excuse me, uncle, if, notwithstand ing the counter-attraction of this all-beauteous fair one, I presume to doubt your resolution there. You have been so long in the habit of gazing on the widow's features, that I verily believe, if you were to marrjf a handsome woman, her ladyship's face would haunt you so o' nights, that you'd soon think your wife ugly.

Suppose your object accomplished, answer me this : When you have stolen from me the precious casket of my wealth, what have you gained ? Will not that which to me would be a blessing, in your possession prove a curse ? Suppose her your wife : true, you wear a jewel in your breast, worthy of a better place ; but will it prove a comfort to you, or the miser's care?

SirVal. Faith! I can't see the likeness o' the picture ; you paint all on one side, Dick, like a squinting sign dauber ; and represent marriage as a Dutch painter would pandemonium. Now, if I were to picture myself in the mar riage state with such a wife, I should borrow the pencil of a Titian, and represent myself reclining upon Venus' mount, quaffing love's nectar \u2014 Ah, delightful ! with ten thousand little Cupids hovering round me; \u2014 and in the back-ground you should see Hymen waving his torch, while Pleasure beckoned me, and Fancy led me by the hand, through Venus' grove, to Venus' blissful bower. Capt. Ha, ha, ha! now you make me laugh. Not for getting, too, in a somewhat more distant perspective, to re present yourself reposing in Venus' bower, while young Desire and busy Fancy dispatch a messenger for Vulcan's garland to twine around your sleeping borws ; that, when you wake, you may enjoy the envied privilege of being lam pooned with impunity, and the proud distinction of a patent crest for wits to blazon, and for fools to point at. Sir Val. No matter \u2014 still you fright me not. For such a wife I'd be content to run the gauntlet of all the wits and fools in Christendom. Capt. Will nothing move you !

I will yet suppose you do not mean it. Much as we have differed, still there has ever been a secret tie upon our dispositions, which yet the sword of strife has never reached. I may have joined in raillery of your foibles, and, under provocation, may have gall'd your self-love; but I have ever upheld your noble qualities, and have been fore most to vindicate your honour when abused. Nay, more than once have laid your enemy at your feet. I put it there fore to your gratitude, to your generosity, to the claim I have upon you, to your own acknowledgement of that claim, to your honour and good faith.

Ay, in reason \u2014 that of course was implied ; and I appeal to reason herself, upon herjudgment-seat, whether a man is bound, on the score of gratitude, to resign his wife or his mistress tinder any circumstances whatever. \u2014 [Aside.] I must evade him.

I must fight him with his own weapons. \u2014 Yet have a care, Sir Val ! how you enter the lists with a younger knight ; one, too, that is inspired with a knowledge of the affection of his mistress, and who will not, therefore, yield his claim to any power but Fate. Sir Val. Let Fate then decide between us. There's my glove upon't, and with it the honour of my knighthood ; by which I swear, to yield when Fate shall give the word, and not a moment sooner. Capt. [Taking up the glove.] Contention be the word then. I shall certainly show you some sport. Sir Val. You'll certainly make a fool of yourself. Capt. I have no fear on that head ; for I mean to oppose myself to your folly. I design to turn your lance aside at the first encounter, unhorse you without wounding you, and leave you in the mire, with your ears assailed by the dis cordant shouts of a multitude of laughing voices: then mount my love upon your charger, and gallop off by her side, amid the giateful huzzaings of the admiring crowd.

Why, in an affair of this nature, there are many things which weigh for and against ; and when the scale on one side is light, and on the other heavy, to change sides a greater weight is requisite to be thrown into the opposite scale. \u2014 Hem !

Well, and what say you to that same love? Lady B. Oh! the same as to any other love\u2014 Don't tease me. Sir Val. But what say you to the end of it ? Lady B. Why, you are the end of it. Sir Val. Well, and what say you to me ? Lady B. Why, what a round-about way you have ! What do I say to you ? Why \u2014 why \u2014 I hate you. Sir Val. Say you love me. Lady B- I can't. Sir Val.

[Aside.] Zounds ! she's at her tricks again\u2014 Oh ! plague on't ! a man may as well woo justice in a court of equity, as hope to win a woman that has many suitors. The art of love is a false-reckoning : Fortune is every thing, and Ovid was an ass. Let no man hope to raise a generous passion in the heart of a coquette \u2014 She is all self love, and would be woo'd for ever. LadyB. Not so \u2014 You paint her outside only. A coquette p 2"], [118, "VALENTINE'S BAT. Act III. 116 is a woman still, only she wears a mask upon her mind, and covers her real inclinations by an artificial fickleness. She is as capable of generosity, of honour, nay, of love, as any of her sex. If she give a loose to raillery 'tis to try her suitors ; for lovers, nine out of ten, are insincere. The art of love, as you say, is a false reckoning : if there be any such, it is not the art of professing ; else any knave might win any woman. Besides, a man may profess love till he create aversion \u2014 I don't say that is your case; for your professing is of another sort, like Don Quixote's enthusiasm, the effect of an imagination set on fire by raking among the embers of romance, and, withal, so very entertaining, that your mis tress could hardly expect to like you half so well as a hus band as a lover- A man, I say, may profess love, and be a proficient in the art, that is, in the art of talking about it; but real lovers only know its nature, and, knowing that, cut out professors in the practice. Is it not so, Sir Harry ? Sir Har. Precisely. Sir Val. I'll give over wooing, and study the law. Lady B. Ha, ha! \"Do so; and I'll study logic, that I may still confute you. Sir Val. Is there any way to win your favour, Madam? Lady B. O! yes \u2014 there is a way; but I can't shew it you \u2014 There is a way to win any woman. Sir Val. I would fain know it, though I paid dearly for it. Lady B. Ah ! but 'tis a secret not to be divulged, in the breast of every woman; yet no one ever did, nor ever will, while the world shall last, disclose it : for well the sex doth know, if once it should escape, their empire over men were lost for ever. But when the world shall end, among other things, 'twill out, and then you'll wonderall what fools you were! iLis this secret, joined with our natural cunning, that instructs us how to angle for men's hearts; which, when we have hooked, we are so fond to play with, that often times they break our lines. But, still, if they be the true species, the real gudgeon hearts, that bite by instinct, we have only to throw out a new bait, and we have 'em again instantly. Sir Val. It is a secret, 1 believe, solely in your own breast : for other women have passions, but you have none. You are made up of art; and what has been improperly said of woman in her species, that she is an iusolvable enigma, ap plies, properly, only to you : for you can run through all"], [119, "Act III. VALENTINE'S DAY. 117 the mazes of ambiguity, and double while you run ; so that there is no following you, even while you keep in sight. They say, that lawyers can with ease Twist words and meanings as they please : But the law itself hasn't more turnings and windings than are in your discourse ; nor is it more uncertain than are your inclinations \u2014 In one word, you deal with the devil. Lady B. Ha, ha ! What a philippic! But you mistake- It is a gift of nature, not, as you suppose, confined to few, but more or less in all women. And, as our sex was des tined to rule over yours, it was necessary, as well for the security of our persons, as for the enforcement of our sove reign will and pleasure, to arm us with some mental wea pon, and to implant in your breasts a secret dread thereof. Dame Nature, therefore, when she lodged the secret with us, infused the spirit of raillery into our dispositions, and cheerfulness, its prompter, into our souls ; for which three precious gifts we can never be too thankful. Our raillery is our only weapon, and serves us both for sword and shield : you men have iron fists, and swords of steel, pistols, and great guns, to fight with. Sir Vol. Yes ; but we have generosity not to use our weapons against women. Lady B. Ah! don't say that. How often, when, out of pure good -nature, we have yielded ourselves to your wishes, and made you our bosom-friends and privy-counsellors ; how often, ingrates as ye are ! in return for the preference we have shown you ; how often, I say, do you lift your rebellious hands against us, and even with sticks and staves unnaturally assault us. Your sex may say what you will, but it is only in our independent state you fear us, and even in that state only while we keep you at a distance; to which end our raillery serves us, likewise, just as the sword of justice in the state to keep the multitude in awe: while we your sovereigns, like yourselves of regal power possessed, so long as we uphold our rule, can do no wrong. Sir Vol. Faith, that was timely brought in ; for I was going to say Lady B. Ah, no matter \u2014 Keep it back \u2014 I have some thing more to say. This same raillery has other qualities no less useful. It has a magnetic power to draw you wheresoever we point it, and that without your knowledge.: so, when wears, iuclin'd to be won, we inveigle you into"], [120, "VALENTINE'S DAY. Act III. 118 the path we'd have you follow : and thence it is, that Cupid is represented blind, yet, notwithstanding, is sup posed to shoot his darts with an unerring hand. \u2014 Now, what were you going to say, Sir Val? Sir Val. Why \u2014 no \u2014 nothing \u2014 nothing. Lady B. Ah! now, that's one of your failings \u2014 You are always silent when you should speak, and talkative when you should hold your tongue. If I were a man, I should seize all opportunities, when my mistress were in good hu mour, to speak my mind freely to her : for it is certain, if a woman is not to be won in her good humour, she is not to be won at all. Sir Val. [Aside ] Now, if I wer'n't in fear of being taken in again, I'd try her once more. Lady B. Well, Sir Val, what do you say to me now that I am in the best humour I have been in for this month? - Sir Val. Why then, this I say \u2014 Look you, Madam, I'll be your fool no longer. I'd rather be a galley-slave the remainder of my life, than continue a month longer the creature of your will and pleasure. If you are disposed to set aside your raillery, and, waving all ceremony, to con vince me, once for all, whether or not you have that re gard for me you have so long encouraged me to believe, you will either seriously reject my suit, or you will not he sitate to give me your hand, now that I ask it for the last time. Lady B. Then take it \u2014 there it is, since you ask it in a proper manner. You might have had it sooner, had you woo'd me in a manlier strain : but whenever I have been in a yielding mood, you have become so extravagant, that I have grown ashamed of my partiality, and have laugh'd it off. Sir Har. [Aside.] Now, the devil take me, if I can tell whether she's in jest or earnest ! Lady B. And let me tell you, if a man will put on a fool's coat to go a-wooing in, it is his fault if his mistress slights him. I would have cured you of your folly by the force of ridicule, but I strove in vain ; your passion carried you away ; and (strange to tell !j your folly, by its own ex travagance, has cured itself. \u2014 You have found, at last, the way to woo me ; and there's my hand in good earnest. Sir Val. Well, better late than never. [Kisses it. Sir Har. [Aside.] 'Sdeath ! then I am thrown out, and have been instrumental to my own undoing. \u2014 [Aside to"], [121, "Act III. VALENTINE'S DAY. 119 her.] Madam, a word with you \u2014 You are not serious with him ? Lady B. Yes, I am, for the first time these three years. Sir Har. Why am I jilted? Lady B. Because you deserve no better. You are rightly served. Those who would raise their own interest on the ruin of another's, (leaving love out of the question, for you know you never felt the passion) deserve to be made instru ments in the hands of Fortune, to promote the interest they seek to undermine. You have a fault, beside, which, believe me, never yet did win a woman who set any true value on herself \u2014 I mean, an impudent and rude beha viour, which, however some may tolerate, and others seem to admire, depend upon it, we all of us hate in our hearts. Sir Har. Oh, confound your preaching ! I see the game's up \u2014 so, damme, I'm off. \u2014 For you, Madam, I wish you all the ills of marriage, and all the joys of repentance \u2014 And for you, Don Amoroso, I wish you\u2014 No, I need not wish you evil, you'll have enough in all conscience; and there fore, out of pity, I wish you joy. [Exit- Lady B. Ha, ha, ha ! Sir Val. Ha, ha ! that's pleasant, i'faith ! Capt. I, too, wish you joy, uncle. Sir Val. Thank you, Dick ! I wish you the same \u2014 and wish your wife mayn't prove too coy. Capt. Oh, she has a tongue. Sir Val. Has she? Then it wants oiling deucedly. LadyB. Did you find her too coy, Sir Val? Sir Val. Why, to say the truth, I did \u2014 She's pretty, and that's all : but she's so cursed shy, she can't say bo to a goose. Lady B- What ! not to such a goose as you must have appeared to her? Capt.

I 1 0 live, learn, and grow wise, is a maxim of old With which Authors allow d are to make rather bold : And though shewing a Knight who has spent all his days In rehearsing of love-scenes and sounding love's praise, May but trifling be thought, as no more than to say That men still are but fools, when their wits run away; Yet perhaps there's a meaning still deeper conceal'd, Which you all may perceive when you see it reveal'd. Still, among you, methinks, tliat I hear some one say 'Tis a whimsical, fanciful, odd sort of play : But then \u2014 what would he have upon Valentine's Day? Sure a play may be good, though the subject be light ; Else, on all kinds of Folly 'twere folly to write, And the Stage would be then in a terrible plight. But our Author conceives 'tis of folly no proof, To make Love's fools his theme, and his end their behoof; And if whimsies and fancies to such men belong, Here to show 'em their fancies and whims can't be wrong : For, on seeing their pictures, most fools, it is said, Will at once become grave, and go wiser to bed. Hence our Author observing men, not half so wise As their years should bespeak 'em in common folk's eyes, Has conceived 'twould a service to some folk be doing, Thus to show 'em how simply they go about wooing ; With their griefs to condole, and their weakness deplore That the worse women use 'em they love 'em the more. But how well, or how ill, he has worked up his play, Is reserved for your plaudits, or hisses, to say : \u2014 > Yet, before you decide on its merits, he fain Would be heard by his Counsel one thing to explain, Just to show that his play doth a moral contain : And, if this shall appear, you'll confess he has done A wise thing, which late Authors so cautiously shun. To support, then, his claim I appeal to all lovers, Whose blind passion, at all times, their weakness discovers I conjure you to take a broad hint, that's well meant, And your folly give o'er ere your time is all spent. But, the better to show you, wherein you do wrong, I'll e'en tell you a story that's not very long."], [126, "EPILOGUE. 124 Once on a time, no matter where, There liv'd a maiden, somewhat fair : Artless she was, and knew no pride, Till flattery put her wits aside. Her lovers all, to show their parts, So talk'd of charms, and fames, and darts, She grew affected, fickle, vain, And treated all with like disdain : But one, among her lovers, saw 'Twas useless still to hum and hah ! He chang'd his tone, and manlier woo'd: She frown d at first, and eall'd him rude, But grew less vain, as he more bold, And listen'd while her faults he told; Till to her former self he brought her, And love and reason, jointly, taught her. Now, as objects are seen by the telescope nearer, And the clearest of prospects are seen through it clearer; So, if you, Gents, but look through this telescope story, 1 ou'll all see your love-making shine forth in its glory : And the story, when tacked to the end of the play, Will illustrate the moral 'twas meant to convey ; Which, as most men go wooing sometime in their lives, Will instruct 'em the way to obtain handsome wives : And, as lovers are bound unto those who befriend 'em, He who shows you your faults, and the way how to mend 'em, Has a claim on your thanks, and by me you may send 'cm.
