The publication of the second or historical portion of this work being unexpectedly delayed, the re vision of the present volume is postponed until that shall appear. Meanwhile, to meet a demand for the volume in its original form, previous edi tions being exhausted, a Third Edition is now offered to the public ; nor will it still, the author hopes, be found a wholly inadequate survey of the North Polar question. The return of the English Expedition is the most important event affecting this question that has occurred since the volume appeared ; and the conclusions which most Arctic scholars have arrived at in looking at the results of that expedition have, it may be observed, in variably tended to strengthen the arguments made use of here, and the direction favoured is the direc tion now advocated by the commander of the late expedition as the one of greatest promise for Arctic explorers. One of the principal objects, moreover, of the present volume having been the renewal of Dutch Arctic research, it is no little satisfaction to the"], [26, "PREFACE. XVI author to be able to state here that a Dutch expe dition has within the past year been organised, and the ides of May will see the ship \"Wilbam Barents,\" only recently launched at Amsterdam, on her way to the far North, to retrace the steps of the navigator whose name is thus fitly comme morated. The expedition will be under the com mand of the Dutch naval officer, J. J. de Bruyne, assisted by Lieutenants L. B. Koolemans Beynen and H. M. Speelman, together with other scientific officers and experts ; and the revisiting, after three centuries, of these regions by Hollanders, and the thorough exploration in the light of modern science of the Barents Sea and surrounding waters, cannot fail to prove a work of real importance. If it has been agreeable to here allude to this renewal of Dutch Northern enterprise, so directly striven for, hardly less gratifying is it to the author to be able to note also the proposed following up of the route specially advocated in this volume by the new \" Pandora\" expedition (sailing under the American flag, and with the distinctive aim to reach the Pole), as being but another of the results of a movement which it has perhaps in some degree been his to promote ; while the assured despatch of the American expedition by Smith Sound, and of the new expedition of Nordenskiold, are matters not to be overlooked in the interests of Arctic investigation.

In introducing the following work to the reader, some explanation is perhaps advisable respecting its origin ; especially as in it (particularly in Volume I.) is involved, in a measure, the his tory of a public cause, or at least what the writer has wished might become such. Should the rela tion, however, embrace too much of the ego, I trust the reader will be indulgent, since these Dutch labours, albeit labours of love towards a venerated ancestral nation, are certainly not undertaken with out some personal sacrifice and self-denial. Volume I. is the greatly amplified result of the first of two short articles \u2014 the second applying similarly to Volume II. \u2014 which appeared in the \" Transatlantic \" magazine of July and August last, under the general heading which forms the title of the present work, and were inspired by the revival ' of the spirit of Arctic research in vol. i. 6*"], [28, "PREFACE. XVIII England, and the desire I felt to see a similar spirit awakened after so long a repose in Holland. It was speedily found that to investigate the field of Dutch Northern enterprise alone at all thoroughly would involve no small amount of research. But I had proposed to myself a much wider field than this in view of the advocacy also of a modern Dutch expedition. This fact seemed to necessitate a glance at the whole North Pole question, and consequently involved the gleaning of data from the vast mass of literature existing upon this subject generally, the extent and formidability of which, for the thorough investigator, may be said to be only comparable to that which, in another way, the Arctic navigator is but too certain to encounter in the vast and formidable ice-fields of the Polar regions ; for the far Northern voyages, however fruitless of results in other respects, con sidered as to their definitive aims, have rarely failed to add something to the accumulating mass of lite rature on this subject. These remarks, however, apply more particularly to my researches since this book was resolved upon ; and my later investigations have caused me to modify my views somewhat in one or tw*o respects. If I ever entertained any other than serious views"], [29, "PREFACE. XIX of the kind of enterprise which calls men from com fortable homes and genial climes to frozen and inhospitable latitudes, I now regard Arctic explora tion more as work and less as play than I did even when the gaily-decked \"Alert\" and \"Dis covery \" left the shores of England with a nation's benedictions. Of the original brief papers more notice was taken, particularly in Holland, than I could have hoped for ; and I have to acknowledge here very encouraging letters from several of the savans, and even statesmen of the Netherlands, whose congra- tulations upon my having taken up this subject were highly to be prized. I may even mention the very cordial recognition of my too trifling services thus far by Mr. N. W. Posthumus, the Secretary of the Dutch Geographical Society, whose own zealous efforts for a renewal of Arctic enterprise on the part of his countrymen have been highly appre- ciated, and whose natural interest in this subject caused him, perhaps, the more readily to welcome a \" medestrijder \" from without. Nor should I omit mention of encouraging words received from Lieu- tenant Koolemans Beynen, of the Dutch Royal Navy, speaking for himself and Commodore Jansen ; which were the more welcome since the former officer per sonifies, if one may so say, the principle of modern"], [30, "PREFACE. XX Dutch Arctic enterprise, having himself accom panied Captain Allen Young on his \" Pandora \" cruise last year to Peel Strait, and is now contem plating a repetition of the voyage with the gal lant Captain in the present season. To the editor of \" Het Vaderland\" at the Hague I am especially indebted. Prior recognitions of humble labours on my part of a more strictly patriotic character relating to Holland having come to my knowledge, I ventured to send to that paper the magazine containing the article advocating a Dutch expedition ; also a copy of the *' European Review\" (of July 24, 1875) containing an article on the same subject, invited by its editor (Mr. Blanchard Jerrold), who had considered the sub ject as one which might fairly be regarded as of public interest. Both these articles were favour ably noticed by \" Het Vaderland,\" which quoted from the latter anonymous article the concluding and most considerable paragraph, in which I had gladly recognised the fact \" that enterprise \" \u2014 albeit not of the kind I was then urging upon their attention \u2014 \" was not dead among the Netherlanders, nor, indeed, the spirit of discovery ; \" and also the following loyal expressions, which I venture to say were penned and quoted with equal pleasure : \u2014"], [31, "PREFACE. XXI \" Whatever pertains to the arts and sciences in their higher as well as in their common forms and applications, is sure of finding a ready recognition on the part of the royal family of Holland. London, so recently favoured with the presence of the Queen of the Netherlands, needs not to be acquainted with the fact of her Majesty's peculiar interest in matters of high public concern, nor have we reason to believe that the resumption of Dutch Arctic exploration would be at all unwelcome to her. It is not unknown in geographical circles, moreover, that Prince Henry of the Netherlands, the patron and honorary president of the Dutch Geographical Society, takes a lively interest in questions germane to this which we would now urge upon the consideration of Hollanders. And what more fitting enterprise than an efficiently organised and well-equipped Government Arctic expedition could there be, to crown the pyramid of giant under takings which have characterised the rule of the restored dynasty, and particularly the twenty-six years' reign of King William III. ? \" These acknowledgments on the part of one of the leading papers of the Netherlands I could not fail to appreciate highly, and I embodied my thanks in a letter to the editor, which he was good enough to publish, supplying it with the exceptional Dutch feature of a heading indicating its subject ; and perhaps a translation of the principal paragraphs of the letter may be appropriately quoted here as a part of the \" history.\" \" It was to me an agreeable task to pen those pages [the magazine article], hoping as I did that they might serve to incite the Dutch nation to take its place once more in the field of Arctic enterprise. I was, moreover, strengthened in this labour by the certainty I felt that the wish, at least, could not but be shared by some of the pat riotic and enlightened citizens of the Netherlands. \" In the course of my somewhat extended Dutch researches in the British Museum, the part early enacted by the Netherlanders as, next to the English, the greatest maritime people, could not escape"], [32, "PREFACE. XXII my notice ; and the organisation of an English Arctic expedition drew my attention to the service Holland has performed in the special province of Arctic research. Unfortunately, however, the memorable deeds of the Dutch are in this respect wholly confined to the proud era of the old Republic\u2014 to the days of Maurice and of Frederick Henry. At a time, therefore, when neighbouring states \u2014 including some but now for the first time seeking recognition among naval powers, and, strictly speaking, interior states \u2014 are rallying their forces for an onslaught upon the vast terra incognita of the North, thoughtful and proud-spirited Netherlanders cannot but ask themselves whether they are not neglecting their duty, so long as the fatherland of Barents and Heemskerk remains behind. In those days of grand adventure, wherein Holland boasted a score of peerless navigators, and dotted the habitable globe with her colonies, the more distinctive aims of the seafaring nations were to add territory to their primal limits, and bring wealth to the coffers of the State. \"Now, at least, as applying to Arctic Discovery, this grain of selfishness is no longer apparent. It is at the call of science, of advancing civilisation, that England has sent forth her promising expedition via Smith's Sound. For England's old rival on the seas, the track of Barents remains invitingly open. Lag behind or fail to avail herself of this she must not. And ' a spirit ' \u2014 to conclude with words elsewhere employed \u2014 ' whose high courage, unyielding as the ice he encountered, was in the appreciation and pursuit of duty equal to adamant itself, such as that which William Barents reveals in his work for the admiration of all the ages, beckons with resistless power to the Netherlanders of to-day to take up once mpre the path of honourable distinction, and renew in the records of the world's progress the glorious deeds of the fathers.' \" My thanks are also due to Colonel D. D. Muter (to whom, in earlier numbers of the \" Transatlan tic,\" the author is indebted for the first encourage ment to his pen) for enabling these Netherland notices to do double duty, by giving them in his weekly journal, and for editorially encouraging"], [33, "PREFACE. XXIII the enterprise. Nor are my obligations less great to the editor of the \" Geographical Magazine \" for a generous recognition of my earlier labours for the revival of Dutch Arctic research. In the autumn of last year, at the friendly suggestion of Mr. Nicholas Trubner, I sent through the latter one of the original papers to which I have alluded to the editor, Mr. Clements Markham, offering the articles to his magazine \u2022 quite conscious myself, however, of their being in everything but their subject unsuited to its pages. The papers were courteously declined ; but the editor added to the refusal a suggestion most acceptable to me \u2014 viz., \" I should, however, be very glad to insert a letter from you, urging the propriety of the despatch of a Dutch Arctic expedition, and a renewal of the enterprises of Holland in a field where she formerly won such renown.\" , . The letter was accordingly written, and found a place in the January number of the \" Geographical Magazine.\" I venture to reproduce it here. The Revival of Dutch Arctic Exploration. To the Editor of the \" Geographical Magazine.\" \" Sir, \u2014 The interest with which you view whatever relates to geographical research may warrant me in addressing you for the purpose of urging the propriety of the despatch of a Dutch Arctic Expedition, and a renewal of the enterprises of Holland in a field where she formerly won such renown. This subject is one in which"], [34, "PREFACE. XXIV I have taken particular interest ; and late recognitions of its import ance encourage the belief that an appeal through your pages may prove of great weight. Perhaps, too, one may, as a citizen of what was once known as New Netherland, speak with not less hope of being heard, next, at least, after one of their own nationality ; and certain I am that the country which boasts its Kane, its Hayes, and its Hall among explorers of the American Polar regions, and as the real pioneers of the promising route chosen for the present English Expedition, would rejoice not less than England to see the country men of Linschoten, of Heemskerk, and of Barents awaking to re newed zeal in this field, and emulating their old adventurous spirit and activity. \" There is no doubt that the Dutch possess to a remarkable degree the qualifications essential to the successful prosecution of Arctic investigation. Habituated from the infancy of their nation to battling with the waves, their many discovery enterprises, and their widespread colonisation of the globe, has accustomed them to distant voyages, and upon almost every sea ; and if for upwards of two cen turies they have surrendered to other countries all practical scien tific efforts in the far Northern waters, they have, to reinspire them to Arctic enterprise, a heritage of brilliant deeds in past times. Though limited to a short period, the literature of the Dutch de scriptive of their Northern voyages is perhaps the richest of any nation's in truly romantic and thrilling story. What country, in deed, has not adopted into its language Gerrit de Veer's faithful narrative of the three voyages of Barents ? And what Hollander is not stirred to the very soul by the grand poem of Tollens, portray ing, in graphic verse, the scenes of the memorable third voyage, and the wintering in Novaya Zemlya ? Thus, in both their prose and poetic literature have the Dutch immortalised their Arctic heroes. The fame, moreover, of that early authority in magnetic and cosmo graphic lore, the indomitable Plancius, who spurred his countrymen on to the renewal of efforts officially stayed by the States-General, will endure so long as the literature of the Netherlands shall remain to furnish for it a fitting shrine. But now another Plancius is needed to ineite the slumbering ardour of the Dutch to new enterprise \u2014 another Barents to follow up and complete the researches of the first. The enthusiasm of the race that gave to the world such men sleeps for the moment, awaiting, it may be, the distinct and persuasive utteranee of tongue and pen, gifted with true eloquence, to call it"], [35, "PREFACE. XXV once more into play. Yet the field which Barents, Linschoten, Heemskerk, and the rest made peculiarly Holland's own, lies in vitingly open to her, and her people possess those characteristics which specially fit them for the resumption of their old-time work. ' It is even possible,' as I have elsewhere suggested, ' that success would sooner crown the equipment of an expedition commanded by so competent a scientific officer as Commodore Jansen' \u2014 though it is not unknown that Holland has begun educating younger officers of her navy in ice navigation \u2014 ' than that which, under Captain Nares, has recently quitted the shores of England. However unani mous may have been the opinions among English Arctic explorers and men of science as to the route chosen for the \" Alert \" and \" Dis covery,\" it is well known that high scientific authorities even in England have inclined decidedly to the route which lies between Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya, upon which Barents, with a per sistence that now seems to have been prescient of later discoveries, sailed to nearly the farthest extent that has been reached. \" 'But England had the best of rights to choose the route she has selected. The last distinctive attempt on the part of her navigators to reach the Pole was made by the gallant Parry in a line directly north from Spitzbergen, and Parry's experience was, we confess, rather confirmatory of continued ice than of \" open water.\" It must, however, be here borne in mind that he was not pursuing his object upon any idea of a thermal passage existing to the Pole ; and his famous sledge journey was prosecuted at a distance of some hundreds of miles west of the European flood-gate of the Gulf Stream. But it is to the renewal of Dutch Arctic enterprise in friendly rivalry with England, rather than the fitting out of an expedition to pursue any route we might prescribe, that we would urge the people of the Netherlands. The choice of routes may well be left to the Dutch geographers, though it would be wise that the radial points of attack should diverge considerably, and the practicability of a passage upon the bosom of the Gulf Stream might for once be fairly tested. \" ' There are, moreover, reasons in favour of a renewal of Arctic enterprise on the part of Holland which, appealing specially to her people, are happily wanting to other countries. The ancient land marks whereby discoverers were wont in past ages to distinguish the lands and seas first sighted or traversed by them, are in danger of being removed, and names effaced from the charts by later hands, unrestrained by reverence for those whose posterity omit to keep"], [36, "PREFACE. XXVI alive the spirit of research. The age that has given to Barents' Sea the designation by which it is now known, has also witnessed the substitution of new names of points, capes, sounds, inlets, straits, and islands for those which would have borne down to future generations not only the nationality of the discoverers, but also the approximate period of discovery. In this respect Holland suffers an injury, which should excite her people to seek redress \u2014 redress that is most capable of being found in the resumption of the work of exploration at the North.' * \" That enterprise is not dead among the Netherlanders is placed beyond doubt by the stupendous magnitude of their own internal improvements, such as the new ship-canal to Amsterdam, the railway over the Meuse, connecting Rotterdam with the south, and the vast project of draining the Zuyder Zee, not to speak of the grand and expensive scheme of the Dutch Government itself for the purpose of inland defence, nor of the undertakings of real moment in their rich empire of Insulind. Moreover, intelligence has but recently come to me that Enkhuyzen is formally moving with a view to this busi ness of Arctic research. A number of the 'most influential residents of Enkhuyzen,' states ' Het Vaderland,' have, as members of the Geographical Society, constituted themselves into a department ; the object being principally the renewal if practicable of the Arctic whaling business, and the advancement of science which must result from that work. The announcement appropriately closes with the words, ' May the example given by Enkhuyzen arouse others to follow ! ' Fitting it is, surely, that the citizens of this ancient trading port of the Netherlands, whose zeal in this field of research is already historic, should now be foremost for a renewal of Dutch Arctic enterprise. That history may further repeat itself in this matter, may we not next see her old southern rival Middelburg come forward once more as a genuine ally of her northern neigh bour ? Nor can the capitalists and leading citizens of Amsterdam remain indifferent in this matter. The city of Plancius and of Barents, like that of Moucheron and the adopted home of Haarlem's Linschoten, is able to wield a most potent influence in forwarding such objects, and from her abundant wealth could well add to her stupendous home enterprises that of practical Arctic investigation. And even for the bringing about of a Government Expedition \u2014 the * \" A Plea for a Dutch Arctic Expedition,\" European Review, vol. i. p. 116."], [37, "PREFACE. XXVII kind demanded for really effective Arctic work \u2014 this zeal and encouragement on the part of towns and individuals are npt less necessary. \" Writing with the firm conviction that there will be a Dutch Arctic expedition \u2014 for I cannot believe that I misinterpret the real spirit of the Dutch people, nor estimate too highly the evidences favour able to this belief \u2014 I feel assured that too much importance cannot be attached to the results likely to accrue therefrom ; knowing that Holland possesses the men thoroughly competent to direct such an enterprise and to achieve and weigh results. \" The numerous discoveries to the west of Greenland in the Arctic zone, which have been made within the last thirty years by England and America, attest what can be done by determined effort in this direction. What, then, may not be done in the much wider field on the European side, now an explored waste upon the map ? Men from the great neighbouring state to Holland, steering their way in the almost hopeless direction of the east coast of Greenland, achieved results with which the nation appears to be well satisfied ; planting high in those regions the German standard, and placing many names on the chart of those latitudes to mark the presence of explorers from this comparatively inland state. Those 'border provinces' of the European Polar regions, Sweden and Norway, have hardly ceased since the days of the Northmen from the pursuit of new investiga tions ; the former threatening, under the guidance of Professor Nordenskiold, to realise to us the dream of the old merchant ad venturers ; while it is to the latter that Holland is herself indebted for the finding of the priceless relics of her unfortunate Barents. Explorers even from the South have also won noble trophies on this Northern field. The Austro-Hungarians, having their sea-view limited mainly to the waters which penetrate the city of Marco Polo, smitten with a desire for Arctic research, have found their way to high latitudes, and these adventures on their part have not been without signal advantage to science, as the name of Emperor Franz Josef's Land bears witness ; and I but echo the assertion of a dis tinguished Dutch geographer in saying that there are not a few men in Holland who yearn for the opportunity of giving to some great unnamed spot in these ice-bound regions the designation of ' Prins Hendrik's Land.' \" S.

XXVIII As the result of influences w*hich these humble efforts of the writers may perhaps have done some thing to stimulate, it is gratifying to be able to state that already Amsterdam is making a move in this matter. For may we not take the action of the Dutch Society for the Promotion of Industry as fairly representative of the city in which it is located, if not even of the nation itself? That Society has, within the past month (April, 1876), presented an important address to his Majesty of the Netherlands, urging various considerations, utilitarian and other, for the resumption of Dutch Arctic enterprise, and the employment therein of \"ships of his Majesty's Marine.\" It is with peculiar satisfaction that I conclude this little sketch of personal efforts in this direction (which I have felt that I might pardonably allude to) with a quotation from that address, expressive of sentiments entirely in accordance with those which the reader will find elaborated in the following pages : \" Considering all this\" (summarised on p. 191), \" we are of opinion that as a seafaring nation Holland should not remain behind, since not only the main tenance of national honour, but also important advantages for the future, are concerned. From the onward tendency of the human mind, and the"], [39, "PREFACE. XXIX continued development of science and industry, it is safe to augur that discovery expeditions to the Polar seas will become more numerous, and in this case the participation of Holland is even a vital question.\" In allusion to a special feature of this work, I ought, perhaps, to say, that when led to the in vestigation of the subject of Arctic exploration, the question of routes was brought forcibly under my notice by two or three short letters in a London paper, in criticism of the course chosen for the English Expedition, and calling attention to the theory (not unknown to geographers) put forward by Captain Silas Bent, formerly of the United States Navy, favouring the existence of a \" Thermal path \" to the Pole in the route of the Gulf Stream, a theory very plausible, and urged more definitely by Captain Bent than by any other advocate of a \" Gulf Stream \" route. These letters were from the hand of his friend Dr. M. S. Fife, of the Mississippi Valley Society in London ; and though it will not be found that I entirely \" endorse \" the theory thus brought more especially to my notice, yet, as it accords with the old route of Barents, the propriety of its investigation, and its conversion, if possible, from a theory into a fact, appealed to my judgment,"], [40, "PREFACE. XXX and may be said to have had some influence in shaping the first part of my work. Moreover, through the kindly intervention of Dr. Fife, a little correspondence took place between myself and the accomplished advocate of the theory, and I cannot refrain from giving here (as I violate no confidence in so doing) an interesting letter, full of encourage ment to Netherlanders. \" 717 Garrison Avenue, St. Loois, Mo., Dec. 13, 1875. \" S.

I am rejoiced that you have taken in hand the im portant task of -giving publicity to the grand achievements of the Dutch in Arctic explorations in early times, since I am sure your work will show that they were second to none, if they do not stand ahead of other nations in the heroic daring and successful penetra tion of that unknown region of the world. In January, 1869, I delivered my first address in this city upon Arctic matters, and then expressed my belief in the correctness of the report of Dutch whalers having reached the Pole in the seventeenth century, 'not withstanding it is the fashion to treat them as fables,' and I have no good reasons for changing that belief from all that has been written and said upon the subject since that opinion was expressed. The Eng lish, or other expeditions, may, bj* the use of steam, force a passage through Smith's Sound into the open Polar Sea, and thence succeed in reaching the Pole ; but I feel quite sure that the only practicable routes will finally prove to be along the paths of the Gulf Stream between Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla, and of the Kuro Siwo through Behring's Straits, and that in the end the credit will be awarded to the Dutch as having been the first to attain to the earth's northern axis, as it is now freely acknowledged that the Norsemen discovered the American continent five centuries before Columbus made his"], [41, "PREFACE.

Hayes inspired the opposition manifested by the Ame rican Geographical Society to my theory (as found most notably in the President Judge Daly's Annual Address, January, 1870), as he was recognised by that Society as the best authority in this country upon Polar matters. He, however, was not an impartial arbitrar, since he was then endeavouring to get up an expedition by the way of Smith's Sound, and had entirely committed himself to that route as the best. So far the question, of course, stands undecided between us, and I feel under obligations to him and the Geographical Society, since their opposition has given a far wider publicity to my views than they would probably have otherwise obtained. \" With the advantages you have had from a thorough examination of all the authorities upon the subject of which you are writing, it would be quite out of place for me to think that I could make any suggestions to you, though I am none the less grateful to you for your kind offer to receive any that I might feel disposed to make. All I can do is to extend to you my cordial wishes that you may succeed in doing such justice to your ancestral nation in this matter as will not only reflect the most gratifying distinction upon yourself, but will also make all Hollanders feel that with our pride of country, and of the grand possibilities that lie before us, we, as Americans, feel a just and honourable interest and pride in everything that redounds to greatness and prosperity of our mother countries. \u2014 With renewed thanks for your courtesy, I am, very sincerely yours, \" Silas Bent.\" My obligations are due to several Dutch authors for kindly offices rendered during the course of this labour, invariably accompanied with expressions of interest for the success of the undertaking \u2014 to Mr. P.

In the first place, it has greatly outgrown the limit originally proposed, a very small book only having been my in tention, embracing the original papers with little or no amplification; some brief extracts from De Veer's third voyage of Barents, and a translation, which I had been encouraged to look for from a gifted hand, of Tollens' celebrated poem, \"The Wintering of the Hollanders on Nova Zembla.\" . In respect to the latter, I was, at the last moment, disappointed, owing to unavoidable cir cumstances. This, however, I can hardly regret now, since there would have been a certain in appropriateness in giving in a geographical work a poem, however directly connected with the sub ject. But I could wish that some poet, with the daring requisite to attempt the translation of this chef cT \u0153uvre of Dutch poesy, and possessing some thing of my own enthusiasm for Holland, would yet place at my disposal an English version of it, in order that it might find a place in our language as a further contribution to this subject. This masterpiece of Hendrik Tollens was indeed long since translated into French by the accom plished Belgian poet, M. Auguste Clavareau, and it has gone through several editions in Holland"], [47, "PREFACE. XXXV alone, the translator having prefaced it with an historical introduction taken from the historian Van Kampen's account of the third voyage of Barents, in his \" Geschiedenis der Nederlanders Buiten Europa.\" In case, therefore, of being so fortunate as to realise my hope in this matter, I should endeavour to supply either this introduc tion or an original one. As the work now stands, Volume II. will give the reader the history of Dutch Northern enter prise, in which necessarily, of course, the voyages of Barents constitute the principal feature, and for these De Veer has been largely drawn upon, particularly for the third voyage. The transla tion of Phillip (adopted by the Hakluyt Society), slightly modernised, has been followed, and his numerous inaccuracies corrected in the text, when having reason to quote. Nor has it been thought unwarrantable to thus treat his translation, since this worthy man has even added quaintness to the ancient Dutch. For the first and second voyages of Barents, I have chosen Linschoten for my principal guide ; agreeing with the historian of the Northern Com pany, Mr. Muller, in giving the preference to Lins choten's account of these two voyages \u2014 he having"], [48, "PREFACE. XXXVI been the chosen annalist of the first, whilst his prominent connection with the second expedition rendered him, perhaps, equally trustworthy with respect to that. For the third, however, De Veer's unvarnished narrative is everything we have, and we could hardly wish for anything better. Mr. Muller (in a letter to the writer) doubts the trustworthiness of De Veer for the first two voy ages (De Veer evidently did not participate in the first), preferring \" very much,\" he says, \" the more accurate account of Linschoten, which has never (to my knowledge) been translated into English,\" adding, \" Should not the Hakluyt Society edit these instead of the well-known narrative of De Veer ? \" One might perhaps rather say in addi tion to that of De Veer (the allusion being to the proposed new edition of the Voyages of Barents which I had been invited to edit). But this interesting writer has been so prominent an authority throughout that it has been thought fit to illustrate the voyages with his admirably quaint old cuts. And this part having been intrusted to the competent hands of Mr. E. Le Bihan, the reader will have no cause for complaint. For the rest of Volume IL, the historian of the Northern Company is himself an important authority, yet"], [49, "PREFACE.

Perhaps the most glorious fruits of this spirit are to be found in the discovery of America by Colum bus, but the same impulse had already prompted the hardy Northmen, and made them in reality the first Arctic explorers, and, as we now know, the true discoverers of America 491 years before Columbus landed on San Salvador, and 496 years before the Cabots (in nearly the same locality as the Northmen) sighted the mainland.

Indeed, whether recounting the history of Northern voyag ing in general, or, as in the present instance, aiming to reawaken to Arctic work a former rival of England's in all maritime doings, it is impos sible not to treat, in some form or other, of the labours of the latter. Almost from the hour when Columbus promised a way to the East \"by the West,\" England tena ciously held to the possibility of finding a navigable passage in that direction. Nor this only. She has willingly employed in the great quest men of foreign birth ; for the Venetian Cabots, sailing from Bristol, were the first to attempt a North-West Passage, un less we except the rather indefinite essay of Colum bus, made only a little earlier. Englishmen, it is true, have sought to reach this"], [64, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 14 goal of early mercantile endeavour by sailing to the North-east. Indeed, some time before Holland awoke to commercial rivalry with England, Sebas tian Cabot himself \u2014 pensioned and appointed \"Grand Pilot\" of England after 1548, in recog nition of his great services to his adopted country \u2014 brought about the despatch of Sir Hugh Willoughby and Richard Chancellor on the first voyage ever projected to discover a North-East Passage ; and the same venerable seaman cheered brave Stephen Burrough when, three years later, he sailed on his North-eastern voyage of discovery for the Muscovy Company, w*hich resulted in the partial exploration of Novaya Zemlya and the contiguous coasts and islands. Beginning with the expedition of Wil loughby, in 1553, and ending with the essay of Captain John Wood, in 1676, to discover a passage to India by the North-east \u2014 mainly prompted by the signal hopes w*hich the intervening Dutch Northern voyages had inspired \u2014 the long series of attempts by that course, undertaken with merely commercial aims, practically closed.

The expedition of Pet and Jackman, so far back as 1580, appears in reality to have been the last expedition of any importance sent out by England exclusively to discover a North -East Passage. But about a hundred years after the expedition of Wood, which closed the long list of North-wes tern and North-eastern voyages made during the seventeenth century, the grand dream of the mer chants was a North-West Passage \u2014 the solution, in fact, of the very problem which Sir Martin Frobisher in his day declared to be \" the only thing left un done in the world whereby a notable mind might be made famous and fortunate.\" To this quest, however, a little variety was given when, in 1776, Captain Cook was despatched in search of the same passage, by sailing north-east from Behring's Straits. Yet he but poorly succeeded, reaching no higher"], [66, "16 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. than 76\u00b0 44' N. ; and his successor in command, Captain Clerke, in an endeavour immediately fol lowing, only shared a similar disappointment (in spite of the tempting bait of \u00a320,000 which Parlia ment had long been holding out to any British dis coverer of a North-West Passage) ; but M'Clure and Collinson, later, were more fortunate. For this particular idea England was always a firm contender. Faith in the existence, and even practicability, of such a passage led to several attempts being made from this time forth to thread the frozen archipelago north of British America. Belief in the North-West Passage theory, indeed, held a place in the minds of men longer far than did the one relating to the course to which the Dutch were always more or less favouarbly inclined, and, even from the Cabots to Ross and Parry, it prompted thitherward many an English navigator. Nor did it cease to do this until the existence of a water way was finally proved, and until, on this particular altar of discovery, was placed the price less offering of the noble Franklin and his brave comrades. Well has it been said that the North- West Pas sage has been to the seamen of England for the past two or three centuries what the Holy Grail was to"], [67, "THE GRAND MODERN EXEMPLAR. 17 the knights of King Arthur's time ; and, in spite of the gallant achievement of M'Clure, Forster had long before perceived the truth when he declared that \"the impossibility of a North-West Passage in a navigable sea was an established fact, and would so remain until a changed revolution of the earth should define new boundaries to the realms of Nep tune and Pluto.\" But just as the unhappy fate of Barents, as we shall see, discouraged the Dutch attempts to reach the East through the Arctic seas, so the loss of Franklin and his fellows caused Englishmen to pause in the vain endeavour to find a commercial highway thither vid Wellington Channel or Melville Sound. However, the numerous searching expeditions despatched by England in the next ten or twelve years, and which were, in one sense, but the natu ral outcome of her centuries of endeavour, im parted at length a new phase to Arctic exploration. It was gradually discerned to be a work promotive in the highest degree of a heroic, naval spirit, and most essential of prosecution in the pure interests of science. It is especially because of the new era thus inaugurated by England in Arctic research that we have thought fit to dwell in advance upon her labours \u2014 so w*ell calculated to stimulate other vol. 1. b"], [68, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 18 countries to emulate her example, which the great quest for Franklin, in particular, undoubtedly did to a large extent. Nor were the comparatively thorough exploration of the North American edge of the Polar regions by the various expeditions and land parties sent out between 1847 and 1859, with the humanitarian charge to find the lost men, or distinct vestiges of them, as the first object, and the important American expedition under Dr. Kane, which opened up new fields to future Arctic ex plorers \u2014 albeit his own somewhat wild reckoning took him far north of the real object of his quest* \u2014 the least of the results which accrued to the world from the Franklin searching expeditions, the influence of which, while extending to other countries, was destined not to be lost upon England herself, though until recently she has for so long a time been reposing on her laurels. * Dr. Kane, apparently with mingled feelings of satisfaction and chagrin, records the fact that, on his return to Upernavik in the autumn of 1855, \" Franklin's party, or traces of the dead which represented it, had been found, nearly a thousand miles to the south of where he had been searching for them.\" But if this instance of signal miscalculation must be charged against the discernment of the explorer whose rare ability and skill rendered him almost pre scient, it will not appear so strange, after all, when it be remem bered that Arctic savans no less renowned than Dr. Petermann had declared, \" that the ' Erebus ' and ' Terror ' were beset near the Siberian coast, and that the best way of reaching them was by sail ing across the Polar ocean between Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla in the middle of winter ! \" \u2014 Quarterly Review, vol. cxviii. p. 152."], [69, ". '9 . CHAPTER II. Holland's enterprise and dutv. The foregoing brief outline will perhaps have served to show what an attraction the mysterious North Polar region has had for England. For the Dutch, however, in a scarcely less degree than for the English, the Arctic field has in the past pos sessed a singular magnetic power. England and Holland, indeed, may be said to hold as of right a sort of quit-claim on the North Pole. They have not, it is true, discovered its secret, but their hardy navigators were among the earliest to undertake the quest, and strive with invincible courage to force their way through the ice-barrier. Yet it is a noteworthy fact, as applicable to Holland, that since brave Hendrik Hudson, in the employ of the Dutch East India Company, nearly 270 years ago, made the attempt to reach the long-sought goal of Cathay by pushing his way through the ice-clogged"], [70, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 20 waters round Novaya Zemlya, but, abandoning that enterprise, turned his bark southward, and founded in the New World another Netherland, upon which a second Amsterdam arose, the work of Holland in the field of Arctic research has been comparatively nil. When we consider the vast number of voyages that have recently been made in pursuit of Arctic discovery by various nations, the absence of Hol land for so long a time from this field is remark able, and the propriety of her re-entering the arena by the side of her old rival on the seas may well suggest itself to those who have at heart the fame of that ancient European commonwealth. But whilst allowing to Holland the utmost credit for her early achievements in the field of Arctic discovery, and conceding to England a far more noteworthy position in the same field, we must not forget that within recent times other countries \u2014 even some of those most secluded from the North ern seas \u2014 have sent forth expeditions to contest the time-honoured claim of these two nations. It was, we fear, greatly because of the shame felt at Eng land's inaction for so long a time past that, moved by an unanimous public sentiment as interpreted by a powerful press \u2014 with the notable exception of the \" Times,\" which actually opposed this movement \u2014"], [71, "HOLLAND'S ENTERPRISE AND DUTY. 21 the Government were brought at length to concede the demands made by science and civilisation in this respect upon the British nation. But little more than two years since, the learned President of the Royal Geographical Society, at the head of a deputation to urge upon Her Ma jesty's Ministers the propriety of sending out a Government expedition to the Arctic regions, used these words : \" Every first-class power of Europe and America, except England, has sent forth expe ditions for Arctic discovery during the last twelve years ; \" and he further urged that, as no scientific expedition had been despatched by England since 1845, it was high time that she resumed her old place in the van of Arctic research. But now that an Arctic expedition has been sent out, with liberal Government support, ably officered and well manned, and fully equipped for a long absence from British shores, these words and those argu ments have lost their force and application with reference to England. The language may, however, still be read with profit by Netherlanders. It is impossible, indeed, that the quotation should not possess a double point for them, and for every one who holds in special regard the fair fame of Holland in the"], [72, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 22 past, or who would see her evidence in the future, by her unwonted enterprise, if not by might, her claims to a first-class position in Europe, so far, at least, as a nation of scarcely four millions of people may hope to do. The sphere of Arctic discovery affords in no small degree a chance for this to be done. The nation which in its earlier career girdled the earth with a belt of settlements ; which can boast her Van Linschotens, her Heemskerks, her Vlamings, her Tasmans, her Le Maires, her Van Noords, her Houtmans ; which is able to contribute to the annals of maritime adven ture perhaps the most important, and to those of Arctic exploration certainly one of the most inte resting, of chapters ; and which has been all this time accustomed to the sea, cannot be wanting in any of the elements requisite for a Polar expedition worthy of the age and of any people, or in the capacity for achieving all the success that is pos sible in this direction. The Dutch, moreover, may perhaps fairly en courage themselves by the idea that no power in the world can wrest from them their early-won distinction in this field of enterprise. In the three voyages of Barents 280 years ago, as described in the simple narrative of his companion voyager and"], [73, "HOLLAND'S ENTERPRISE AND DUTY. 23 diarist, Gerrit de Veer, but especially in that me morable third voyage, and the wintering in Novaya Zemlya, which the pen of Tollens has immortalised in their poetic literature, the Dutch have something so gallant and heroic to point to by way of at tempts to solve the great Polar mystery, as seems to render comparatively secure their Arctic fame, and almost to excuse the inertness which has charac terised them in this particular in more modern eras. There are considerations, however, which even here outweigh, as will presently be seen, this willingness to rest in possession of past glories. Situated as Holland is out of the current of European travel, and, moreover, walled in by the almost insurmountable barrier of her cherished lan guage, the world is (and is but too likely to con tinue) in comparative ignorance of the important undertakings of the Dutch within the confines of their own territories. Yet let her join the ranks of modern explorers, and send forth a national expedi tion to the North Polar seas, and her labours will assuredly not go for nought in the estimation of other countries. It is true that Holland is not without just claims to be considered as already within those ranks, so far as inland discovery is concerned.

More than this, it is not unknown that the Dutch are already occupied with the subject of equipping a * Most of our readers will no doubt readily recall to mind the lamentable fact to which we here refer, namely, the death of the enterprising Dutch ladies, Madame Tinn. and her sister the Baroness Van Capellan, in 1864, and later that of Miss Alexandrine Tinne, daughter of the former. The deaths of the two first named occurred as they were making a half-pleasure, half-exploring tour up the White Nile ; whilst Miss Tinne, the real inspirer of these bold emprises of woman, was cruelly assassinated by false Tawarek chiefs, when proceeding upon her principal expedition, destined for the heart of Africa. The remarkable life of Miss Alexandrine Tinn., it may be ob served, has not lacked biographers in many languages, and her dauntless courage, exhibited in another way, was well worthy the country of Kenau Hasselaar. In our own language Professor William Wells, of Columbia College, has paid, excellently, his part of the considerable debt which New York owes to Holland, in his \" Heroine of the White Nile ; \" while in Holland itself the Secretary of the Dutch Geographical Society, Mr. N. W. Posthumus, has per formed a lasting service to Geographical Science by giving to the world an elaborate address, delivered by him before the Society, setting forth the claims of Miss Tinn^ to a place in the honoured roll of African explorers. And, apropos of our own subject, it is not un worthy of mention that, to use the words of Professor Wells, \" her first great journey was to the North Cape, away up towards the frozen oceans,\" having been carried out under the guidance of a celebrated Norwegian artist.

The extent of the Dutch Indies, which seem relatively so small, will perhaps be better realised when it is understood that the coast of Acheen is itself as extensive as that of France. And perhaps it may be here remarked, with reference to the Arctic whaling ventures of the various nations (which have contributed largely to train men for more momentous service), that the Dutch during a long period characteristically con tended for the prizes in this field ; and the sum of knowledge of the Spitzbergen and Greenland seas, gathered by Commodore Jansen, of the Dutch Navy, together with his observations upon the habits of the cetacean tribe in those waters, no less than in the broader sphere of nautical science, have been gladly recognised by both England and America.4* * See, among others, his article on the Gulf Stream in \" Ocean High ways and Geographical Review,\" New Series, vol. i. p. 98.

There is great danger, moreover, if she do not set up anew her landmarks, that the names which her navigators placed on Polar charts, like those in so many other parts of the globe, will soon have become totally erased from the maps, and ere long forgotten, completing the analogy which has been traced between Holland and Ph\u0153nicia, by bequeath ing no native contemporary record of her own im mortal deeds. The enduring honour which associates itself in successive generations of men with the discovery and naming of landmarks, affords the surest mate rials out of which to reconstruct a nation's history when its literature may, perchance, have perished.

The Dutch, arresting their efforts in the far North with the early undertakings of Barents and his fellows, and prudently contenting themselves, we had almost said, with cartography in the kind lier climes of the New World, where they employed (with possibly better success) some of the same names so dear in Fatherland, and also with the consolidation of their equatorial empire in the East, have not sought the honours of nomenclature for the American Polar regions. But it may safely be assumed that discoverers in those parts would not like to see the names whereby they have there marked their enterprises \u2014 such names as recall memories of Washington and Jackson, of Jefferson and Lincoln, of Ellesmere, Franklin, Peabody, * History of the United Netherlands (London : John Murray, 1867), vol. iii. p. 558."], [78, "28 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. Grinnell, Kane, Parry, Kennedy, Ross, and Hall \u2014 thus rudely defaced or ignored by later voyagers. There is but one course, therefore, for the Dutch to pursue in this respect, and that is, to furbish anew the courage and daring which characterised them in former times, and assert their right to recogni tion in the face of the world ; insisting in future, at all events, on a fair division and acknowledg ment of geographical distinctions. It could perhaps be fairly argued that Holland has a theme of tolerably engrossing interest before her in the Achenese war, while England resorts to Arctic exploration at a time of profound peace throughout her dominions, when her seamen are rusting in indolence, and when there is no valid gauge of the sufficiency and completeness of her naval resources. Yet we cannot think, notwithstanding this pos sible plea, that Dutch spirit would allow of entire excuse on such grounds. Acheen, though it may draw somewhat both upon the blood and the trea sure of the nation at home, can cause little more than a mere diversion of Holland's strength and resources ; while even viewed from this standpoint, the expedition of Captain Hall, conceived and (in part) conducted in the height of the American Civil War, and the second German expedition, originated"], [79, "HOLLAND'S ENTERPRISE AND DUTY. 29 by Dr. Petermann and commanded by the gallant Koldeway, which was being prosecuted when all Germany was in arms, prove that Arctic investiga tion, like many other objects of science, may make headway through the instrumentality of countries apparently diverted, at the time, by warlike pur suits. Nor does France, in a certain sense, furnish a less encouraging example. Indeed, we have the best authority for saying that the Arctic expedition, projected shortly before the war by Lieutenant Lambert, of the French Navy, and almost on the point of departure when his country became sud denly involved in desperate strife, was abandoned for no real want of resources, or of resolute purpose on the part of Frenchmen to prosecute Arctic en terprise, even amidst national disaster, but solely because of the death of the gallant promoter of the undertaking.* * The project of M. Gustave Lambert, perhaps not very familiar to our readers, was one of three much-discussed schemes for pene trating to the Pole by different routes, which came up after the year 1865. The schemes were ably discussed before the French public by the distinguished geographer and present President of the Council of the French Geographical Society, M. V. A. Malte-Brun, in his work entitled \" Les Trois Projets d'Exploration au P61e Nord,\" meaning thereby the English, German, and French propositions for advancing towards the Pole. In this work were fairly examined the respective values of the plans of the late Admiral Sherard Osborn, by Baffin's Bay and Smith's Sound, now being carried out by the English expedition under Captain Nares ; that by Spitz-"], [80, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 30 Were it not that the demands of science are blind and unreasoning, the Dutch might very well urge, as a counter-argument to these for the renewal of Arctic research on the part of Holland, the fact of the great expenditure now being incurred by the country in prosecuting her public works ; for no nation beneath the sun is engaged in more stupen dous enterprises for the development of its home and colonial resources than is Holland at the pre sent time. Enough to state that she is forthwith to take in hand the recovery of a large portion of the Zuyder Zee, by which bold undertaking nearly six per cent, in productive acreage will be added to the national area. But assuming that States-General and Cabinet see not their way clear for such an enterprise as we would here advocate, under the distinct sanctions of Governmental support, may it not be that some modern Plancius will come forth and persuade the wealthy merchants of Amsterdam themselves to fit out an expedition worthy of their great city . Let one of her own respected citizens furnish the reply : \"As the city of Amsterdam at the close of the six teenth century promoted Polar expeditions, when bergen, as advocated by Dr. Petermann and supported in England by General Sabine, and that by Behring's Straits, as projected by Lieu tenant Lambert, and endorsed by the learned societies of France."], [81, "HOLLAND'S ENTERPRISE AND DUTY. 31 the States, despairing of success, had become dis couraged, so shall the Amsterdam of the second half of the nineteenth century demonstrate that it is still the life-giving heart of the nation, exhibiting not a feeble pulsation, but the central fountain, whence streams forth a vigorous, beneficent pulsa tion to all the other parts.\" \"\u25a0* From such a city and capital it is reasonable to entertain large hopes in regard to the matter of Holland's engaging anew in Arctic research. It is worth bearing in mind that during the eventful period of maritime discovery, in the six teenth and seventeenth centuries, every attempt practically to pass the barriers of the far North was made at the cost of private persons, or, rather, at the expense of companies of merchants ; and in later times, also, the world has been largely indebted to private enterprise for such knowledge as it has been able to gain of the Polar regions. An example is at the present moment being furnished to our times of what even individual enterprise may do in promoting the advancement of geographical dis covery, leaving out of the account here the almost continuous Arctic researches of Professor Nordens- * N.

Witness the despatching, by the proprietors of two great metropolitan news papers in London and New York, of the already successful Central African expedition, under the leadership of the brave discoverer of Livingstone. In one of these instances, indeed, the display of in dividual enterprise has extended to Arctic research. Obviously, however, no expeditions in the world stand more in need of the financial aid, skilled ex perience, and disciplinary control which Govern ments only are able properly to command, than those having for their end the attainment of the North Pole; and the little pinnace \"Search-thrift,\" in which brave Stephen Burrough set sail in the spring of 1556 from Gravesend, and the quaint 100 ton ship \" Mercurius,\" of Barents, with its fishing smack tender, which left the Texel on the 5th of June 1594, or the two vessels of the famous third voyage, commanded by Jacob van Heemskerk and Jan Corneliszoon Ryp, which sailed from Amster dam on the 10th of May 1596, not to speak of the diminutive cock -boat \" Hopewell,\" of the Muscovy Company, in which Hudson in 1607, with a crew of ten men and a boy, thought to sail straight across the Pole to Japan, and actually reached"], [83, "HOLLAND'S ENTERPRISE AND DUTY. 33 nearly the highest latitude that has ever been at tained, contrast strangely enough with the perfectly appointed screw-steamers \"Alert \" and \" Discovery,\" of the Arctic expedition recently launched by Eng land. c"], [84, "34 CHAPTER III. GOVERNMENT EXPEDITIONS. At this point Mr. Clements Markham's observa tions on the value of Government expeditions recur with peculiar cogency and force, and this subject may not perhaps unreasonably claim some notice at our hands. That clear and thoroughly competent author and geographer (a cousin, we believe, of the accom plished seaman whom England has sent out in secondary command of her expedition) states that during the searches made for Sir John Franklin, officers and men sought Arctic service as the most popular employment in the navy. There is no doubt that private expeditions, without naval dis cipline, inefficiently equipped, and inadequately provisioned, are exposed to great dangers ; but so would they be in all other parts of the world. It is for this reason that all officers with Arctic experi-"], [85, "GOVERNMENT EXPEDITIONS. 35 ence insist upon the necessity for a Government naval expedition, and for officers and men being under naval discipline and control. An Arctic expedition, Mr. Markham tells us \u2014 speaking, too, with Arctic experience \u2014 must be thoroughly equipped, wanting nothing that can be deemed essential to either its success or safety; and such thorough provision is only likely to be made by Governments, acting through experienced Arctic and naval officers. Moreover, in the case of con siderable numbers of men passing through an Arctic winter, naval discipline and naval esprit de corps are extremely important. In this view the Hon. George M. Robeson, Secretary of the United States Navy, now fully concurs. In his report to the President, after examining the rescued men of the \" Polaris,\" he emphatically says that \" there is little of either success or safety in any expedition which is not organised, prosecuted, and controlled under the sanctions of military discipline.\" The dangers of Arctic navigation are thoroughly understood ; and those who are best acquainted with them, through a long practical experience, are the best \u2014 indeed, the only \u2014 authorities as to their value.

Nor (as Mr. Markham well says) are Collinson, Ommanney, Richards, M'Clintock, Sherard Osborn, or Vesey Hamilton, the men to give foolhardy advice. Yet all are of opinion that, Avith modern appliances, and by working in the light of former experience, there is no undue danger in Arctic service, provided that the expedition be under naval discipline and Government control.\"\" To quote, on the last j\u00bboint, the very words of one of the most venerated of these authorities, the late Admiral Osborn : \" An exploration of the Polar area should always be sent under naval auspices and naval discipline.

Practical illustration of this is furnished by the distinguished authority just cited. Captain Osborn states, in the same paper from which we have quoted, that he had frequently been asked by old shipmates, \" Are we going up that way again, sir . Please don't forget I am a volunteer.\" As already intimated, the danger from Arctic service is by no means so great as it might at first glance seem to be. This may be seen by the low percentage of deaths furnished by this service. A distinguished naval officer, who has served in the Arctic regions, declares that \"of all the seas visited by men-of-war, the Arctic have proved the most healthy ; \" and Mr. Posthumus observes that since the year 1841 England and America have sent out thirty-two expeditions, the total number of deaths from which has amounted to only 38 men, or 1*7 per cent. ; which would only appear relatively more favourable were it to include the expeditions of the Swedes, Norwegians, and Germans. * Also, the late * De Nederlanders en de Noordpoolexpeditien, p. 31."], [88, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 38 Lieutenant Maury, in 1865, stated before the Geo graphical Society of London, what would be equally true at the present time, that \" if they looked at the wreck-charts, they would see that more lives were lost in sight of our own shores during last year than had perished during forty and odd years in all the Arctic expeditions put together.\" Dr. Hayes furnishes some important testimony bearing upon this point, and at the same time arguing for the general cheerfulness prevailing among Arctic crews, itself a great conserver of health.

In the organisation of the early Dutch expedi tions, of which ampler narration will hereafter be given, it is true that the enthusiasm of Linschoten and Barents, and the active zeal of Plancius and of the Enkhuyzen Pensionary Maalson, did not pass as of small moment with the enlightened statesmen of their time. Prince Maurice and the illustrious advocate Barneveldt embraced thoroughly the theory of a North-East Passage to the seats of Oriental commerce, and the States-General gave their support to the second expedition, firmly be lieving that the speediest of ocean-routes to Cathay was already, to all intents, within their power of attainment. This was, in fact, a Government expedition, and consisted of seven ships \u2014 two from Enkhuyzen, two from Zealand, two from Amsterdam, and a sort of reporting yacht from Rotterdam. It ultimately proved a more signal failure, however, than the less ambitious experiment previously made, so much so that it might be accepted by believers in omens as an unhappy augury for future Govern ment expeditions on the part of Holland. On the return of this expedition, the Govern-"], [91, "GOVERNMENT EXPEDITIONS. 41 ment, after mature deliberation, decided to pro secute the search for the North-East Passage no further at the public expense. The States-General, however, worthily closed the public record with re spect to Dutch Arctic enterprise by offering a reward of 25,000 florins to any navigators who should accomplish a voyage to China by the desired route, and a proportionate sum to those whose efforts towards its achievement might be deemed com mendable, even though not crowned with success. This was highly honourable to Holland. But perhaps, in spite of all, it was more to the national honour, and especially to the immortal renown of Amsterdam, that, thanks to the chief pilot of these voyages and to the cosmographer Plancius, the first city of the country did not allow these under takings to close with the second voyage. Amster dam listened to the representations of Barents and Plancius. A third and final expedition was fitted out.

POLAR PROBLEMS. But what are the prospects as to the solution of the North Polar mystery for those countries whose spirit of enterprise shall prompt them to co-operate with England in her laudably resumed labours ?

Yet, on a calm review of the position, it is scarcely possible to resist the conviction, that now, if ever, the steady prosecution of Northern geographical research, sustained by various Governments in friendly rivalry, promises a rich harvest of results to those engaging in it, and the work of Holland would certainly not prove the least remunerative. The mythological fables of centuries ago \u2014 the"], [93, "POLAR PROBLEMS. 43 weird fictions of the barnacles and of the men whose heads were borne beneath, instead of upon, their shoulders, were dispelled by the early Dutch voyagers. The dreams of Golcondas in the East, awaiting the discovery of shorter than the ordinary routes to bring their treasures nearer the commer cial centres of European civilisation, are given up for ever. In the North-west, M'Clure, rewarded by the British Parliament for following a water-line which he conclusively demonstrated could yield no navigable passage, has shown the futility of the effort to realise it ; and in the North-east the serried masses of ice encountered and sought to be forced with almost superhuman bravery by men of every European race, effectually disposed of the hope of navigating, to any great extent, the frozen sea which bounds Asia on its northern side. The threshold of the unknown region, indeed, has been ploughed by ships and narrowly scanned by competent observers to such an extent that, while it may, perhaps, be said we do not know what can be discovered, we do certainly know where all anticipations of further progress are altogether in vain. It is upon no merely speculative chance of attaining a knowledge of the unknowable that the \"Alert\" and the \"Discovery\" have been"], [94, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 44 equipped from English shores. Those vessels go to reap the harvest of fields discovered, though not traversed, by the American explorers Kane and Hayes, but especially by the gallant Hall in the \" Polaris.\" The issues of that latest American expedition are clear and determinate. It may be true that the vessel was not built, nor equipped, nor manned for pushing on to higher northern latitudes than those that were attained ; and that the death of her commander, and the lack of the moral force of disciplinary control on the part of his successor, might have brought disaster to the expedition had resolute endeavours been put forth to gain the im mediate vicinity of the Pole, as was evidently Cap tain Hall's desire and intent ; but the consensus of opinion of the officers, numbering in their ranks at least one experienced Arctic navigator, and more than one man of science, tends to establish firmly the belief that there is, at certain seasons of the year, even by the channel which forms so great an artery for the downward flow of the vast ice accumulations of the Arctic winter and glacial region, an open, navigable way to the Northern point of radiation. So far has evidence been gathered up that bears definitely out the conviction pointing to the exist-"], [95, "POLAR PROBLEMS. 45 ence of ways to the Pole, that dissuasion falls idly upon men now, as long ago it fell upon the ears of Columbus, when his eager eyes saw the floating evidences, washed by the waves of the Atlantic upon European shores, of the existence, far away to the west, of a world not identified by the geo graphers of his time. Present this evidence at any great length we cannot here.

The latter argument is worthy of being further dwelt upon. It is a singular fact that birds that in the warm months of summer seek the congenial air of European countries, are known to fly away at the approach of the cold season, unresting on the wing, almost blackening the horizon by their numbers, far over perpetually frost-bound Green land, as if en route to a tropical atmosphere in the immediate vicinage of the Polar axis. The knot and the brent goose, the latter well known among the summer visitants of Holland, find Europe too severe, toward the close of the autumn, to tempt them to prolong their stay. The brent goose, of which Kane gives particular accounts,* has been observed to reproduce its kind only upon islands, natural instinct teaching the bird that its * Arctic Explorations : The Second Grinnell Expedition in search of Sir John Franklin, in 1853, 1854, 1855 (London : Triibner & Co., 1856), vol. i. pp. 302, 303."], [97, "POLAR PROBLEMS. 47 eggs are not safe where foxes roam at will. The knot, on the other hand, furnishes the singular example of a bird of which no egg has yet been found ; the presumption being that it needs greater quietude and warmth than inhabited countries give to induce it to pair and multiply its species. * Yet these feathered children of nature are known to take their periodical flight farther northward than the daring of man has penetrated. Here, surely, are the truest guides \u2014 dumb though they be \u2014 to the region we have been wont to imagine so hemmed in by eternal barriers of ice that life was impossible within its circle. Man may err, but Nature does not lie, and in following closely upon the heels of Nature it is impossible to mistake the clues that are available for the solution of Polar problems. Some observations placed upon record by that illustrious explorer to whom science, in whatever relates to Arctic exploration, would seem to be superlatively indebted, recur to us at this point as worthy even of a somewhat extended quotation \u2014 marvelling as one is led to do at the apparent rever- * See also an interesting account of this bird, quoted from Professor Newton, in Markham's \" Threshold of the Unknown Region,\" fourth edition, pp. 304-306."], [98, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 48 sal of those laws of nature, ordinarily so opposed to the conclusion, by which is rendered possible the existence of an open Polar sea. \" An open sea near the Pole,\" says Dr. Kane, \" or even an open Polar basin, has been a topic of theory for a long time, and has been shadowed forth to some extent by actual or supposed dis coveries. As far back as the days of Barents, in 1596, without referring to the earlier and more uncertain chronicles, water was seen to the east ward of the northernmost cape of Novaya Zemlya ; and, until its limited extent was defined by direct observation, it was assumed to be the sea itself. The Dutch fishermen above and around Spitzbergen pushed their adventurous cruises through the ice into open spaces varying in size and form with the season and the winds ; and Dr. Scoresby, a vene rated authority, alludes to such vacancies in the floe as pointing in argument to a freedom of move ment from the north, inducing open water in the neighbourhood of the Pole. Baron Wrangell, when forty miles from the coast of Arctic Asia, saw, as he thought, a 'vast, illimitable ocean,' forgetting for the moment how narrow are the limits of human vision on a sphere. So, still more recently Captain Penny proclaimed a sea in Wellington Sound, on"], [99, "POLAR PROBLEMS. 49 the very spot where Sir Edward Belcher has since left his frozen ships ; and my predecessor, Captain Inglefield, from the masthead of his little vessel, announced an ' open Polar basin,' but fifteen miles off from the ice which arrested our progress the next year. \" All these illusory discoveries were, no doubt, chronicled with perfect integrity ; and it may seem to others, as since I have left the field it sometimes does to myself, that my own, though on a larger scale, may one day pass within the same category. Unlike the others, however, that which I have ven tured to call an open sea has been travelled for many miles along its coast, and was viewed from an elevation of 480 feet, still without limit, moved by a heavy swell, free of ice, and dashing in surf against a rock-bound shore.* * It is not, perhaps, too much to say that Dr. Kane's supposed dis covery in this respect has already passed within practically the same category as those of the other explorers. Yet his successor, Dr. Hayes, on the 19th of May 1861, when planting the American flag at the northernmost point attained by him, from a high elevation beyond even Morton's farthest, looked out upon what gave every indication of being a vast open sea. The experience of Captain Hall, however, who exceeded Morton's farthest by nearly two de grees, and Dr. Hayes' by something less, proved their \" open sea\" to have been a mere Polynia, or water-hole. He found the supposed Polar sea to be \" a sound opening into Kennedy Channel, with an inlet on the east, probably marking the north shore of Greenland \" {Nature, vol. viii. p. 171). 1>"], [100, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 50 \" It is impossible, in reviewing the facts which connect themselves with this discovery \u2014 the melted snow upon the rocks, the crowds of marine birds, the limited but still advancing vegetable life, the rise of the thermometer in the water \u2014 not to be struck with their bearing on the question of a milder climate near the Pole.

He states at the outset of the account of his voyage that his chief object and aim was \" to explore the boundaries of the open Polar Sea \u2014 at least to deter mine if such a sea did exist,\" and in a chapter upon the former he says \u2014 \" By referring to the circumpolar map, the reader will be able to form a more accurate judgment and a more correct understanding of what is meant by the term ' Open Polar Sea ' than he could from the most elaborate description.

He will observe that this sea is almost completely surrounded by land, and that its shores are, for the most part, well defined, the north coasts of Greenland and Grinnell Land, which project farthest into it, being alone undetermined. He will note that these shores occupy, to a certain extent, a uniform distance from the Pole, and are everywhere within the region of perpetual frost. He will remember that they are inhabited everywhere' by a people of the same race, to whom the soil yields no subsist ence, who live exclusively by hunting and fishing, and confine their dwelling-places either to the coast or to the banks of the rivers which flow northward. He will observe that the long line of coast which gives lodgment to the Arctic nomads is interrupted in three principal places, and that through these the waters of the Polar Sea mingle with the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, these breaks being\" Baffin's Bay, Behring's Straits, and the broader opening between Greenland and Nova Zembla ; and if he traces the currents on the map, and follows the Gulf Stream as it flows northward, pouring the warm waters of the Tropic Zone through the broad gateway east of Spitzbergen and forcing out a return current of cold waters to"], [103, "POLAR PROBLEMS. 53 the west of Spitzbergen and through Davis Strait, he will very readily comprehend why in this inces sant displacement of the waters of the Pole by the waters of the Equator the great body of the former is never chilled to within several decrees of the freezing-point ; and since it is probably as deep, as it is almost as broad, as the Atlantic between Europe and America, he will be prepared to under stand that this vast body of water tempers the whole region with a warmth above that which is otherwise natural to it, and that the Almighty hand, in the All-wise dispensation of His power, has thus placed a bar to its congelation, and he will read in this another symbol of Nature's great law of circulation, which, giving water to the parched earth and moisture to the air, moderates as Avell the temperature of the zones \u2014 cooling the Tropic with a current of water from the Frigid, and warming the Frigid with a current from the Tropic. \" Bearing these facts in mind, the reader will perceive that it is the surface-water only which ever reaches so low a temperature that it is changed to ice ; and he will also perceive that when the wind moves the surface-water, the par ticles which have become chilled by contact with the air mingle in the rolling waves with the"], [104, "-4 DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 54 warm waters beneath, and hence that ice can only form in sheltered places, where the water of some bay is so shoal, and the current so slack, that it becomes chilled to the very bottom, or where the air over the sea is uniformly calm. He will re member, however, that the winds blow as fiercely over the Polar Sea as in any other quarter of the world; and he will, therefore, have no difficulty in comprehending that the Polar ice covers but a small part of the Polar water, and that it exists only where it is nursed and protected by the land. It clings to the coasts of Siberia, and springing thence across Behring's Straits to America, it hugs the American shore, fills the narrow channels which drain the Polar waters into Baffin's Bay through the Parry Archipelago, crosses thence to Greenland, from Greenland to Spitzbergen, and from Spitz bergen to Nova Zembla, \u2014 thus investing the Pole in an uninterrupted land-clinging belt of ice, more or less broken as well in winter as in summer, and the fragments ever moving to and fro, though never widely separating, forming a barrier against which all the arts and energies of man have not hitherto prevailed.\""], [105, "CHAPTER V. OPINIONS OF THE GEOGRAPHERS. The existence of an open sea at the Pole, and the question as to the presence at the Northern axis of our globe of those mighty currents \u2014 \" the warm rivers of the sea,\" as they are termed by Commo dore Jansen \u2014 which are known to exert so marked an influence on climates in other parts of the world, are certainly among the grand problems to be solved by that minute investigation which is looked for from future Arctic exploration. It is pertinent to our subject to notice that singularly well-balanced opinions of high Arctic authorities upon these two points have not been withheld even in advance. For instance, Dr. Augustus Petermann, whose eminence as a geo grapher and Arctic authority we need not here proclaim, holds that \"all facts connected with the geography of the Arctic regions, whether as"], [106, "56 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. regards the extent of actual exploration or the observation on the currents, climate, drift-ice, and drift-wood, lead to the conclusion that the regions under the Pole consist of an expanse of sea and not land,\" and that the same would be found to be navigable ; and his long advocacy of the Spitz bergen route has been largely based on the almost certain influence of the Gulf Stream for helping to attain the highest Northern latitude. Another learned German writer, Dr. Joseph Chavanne, arguing from data furnished by the more recent expeditions, while sustaining the theory of the warm poleward currents of the Gulf Stream and Kuro Siwo, moreover deduces the con clusion that both an Arctic continent (or archi pelago) and an open Polar sea would be found at the Northern axis of our globe.* * The following are the several conclusions arrived at by Dr. Chavanne (see, for original paper complete, carefully discussing the subject, Petermann's \" Mittheilungen,\" heft viii., 1874), which are certainly very interesting: 1. The long axis of the Arctic land mass (which probably consists of an island archipelago separated by narrow arms of the sea, perhaps only fjords) crosses the mathematical pole; it thus bends round Greenland, north of Shannon Island, not towards the north-west, but runs across 82\u00b0 and 83\u00b0 N. lat. in a northerly direction, proceeding thence towards N.N.E. or N.E. 2. The coast of this Arctic continent is consequently to be found between 25\u00b0 and 170\u00b0 E. long, in a mean N. lat. of 84\u00b0 and 85\u00b0, the west coast between 90\u00b0 and 170\u00b0 W. long, in a latitude from 86\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. 3. Robeson Channel, which widens suddenly north of 82\u00b0 16' N. lat.,"], [107, "OPINIONS OF THE GEOGRAPHERS. 57 Sir Edward Sabine, a name distinguished among scientific discoverers and, as a companion of Parry and Clavering on important Northern voyages, a practical Arctic authority, has indi cated his views upon both questions in one brief sentence. In his annual address as President of the Royal Society, in 1864, he queries, \"May it not be possible that the iceless sea teeming with animal still widening, bends sharply in 84\u00b0 N. lat. to the west; Smith Sound, therefore, is freely and continuously connected with Behring's Straits. Grinnell Land is an island which probably extends to 95\u00b0 W. long., south of which the Parry Islands fill up the sea west of Jones' Sound. 4. The sea between the coast of the Arctic Polar land and the north coast of America is traversed by an arm of the warm drift-current of the Kuro Siwo, which pierces Behring's Straits, and thus at certain times and in certain places is free of ice, allowing the warm current to reach Smith Sound. 5. The Gulf Stream gliding between Bear Island and Novaya Zemlya to the north-east washes the north coast of the Asiatic continent, and is united east of the New Siberia Islands with the west arm of the drift-current of the Kuro Siwo. On the other hand, the arm of the Gulf Stream, which proceeds from the west coast of Spitzbergen to the north, dips, north of the Seven Islands, under the Polar current, comes again to the surface in a higher latitude, and washes the coast of the Arctic Polar land, the climate of which, therefore, is under the influence of a temporarily open Polar sea; hence both the formation of perpetual ice, as well as excessive extreme of cold, is manifestly impossible. 6. The mean elevation of the Polar land above the sea diminishes towards the Pole. 7. The sea between Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya to Behring's Straits is even in winter sometimes free of ice, and may be navigated in summer and autumn. 8. The most likely routes to the Pole are\u2014 first, the sea between Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya; and second, the sea north of Behring's Straits along the coast of the unknown Polar land {Nature, vol. x. p. 230)."], [108, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 58 life, described by Kane as viewed from the northern limit of his research, is, as he himself surmised, but the extension of the same equatorial stream which produces corresponding abnormal effects at every point to which its course has been traced ? \" and adds, \"When philosophical research shall be re sumed within the circle which surrounds the Pole, this, perhaps, will be one of the earliest problems to receive solution.\" On the first point, moreover, Sir Roderick Mur chison, to whom science is so largely indebted and the revival of Arctic exploration is so greatly due, from his chair as President of the Royal Geo graphical Society (in 1865), had no hesitation in declaring it as his belief, based upon geological grounds, that there was \" a Polynia, or sea, around the Pole,\" which he considered borne out, too, by the nature of the pack-ice north of Spitzbergen \u2014 attested by Parry, Scoresby, and other voyagers \u2014 \" without a trace of these icebergs, carrying blocks of terrestrial remains, which float down Baffin's Bay from the glaciers on the coast of Greenland.\" Again, Dr. I.

Malte-Brun and other eminent geographers and men of science that might be named, practically endorse the theory of Lieutenant Lambert, which involves the existence at certain seasons of the year of a navigable Polynia, materially influenced by the mighty currents coursing their way to the Polar regions through Behring's Straits and be tween Novaya Zemlya and Spitzbergen. The observations, moreover, of Hedenstrdm, Anjou, and Wrangell \u2014 proud names, be it said, in Arctic annals \u2014 have led the Russian geogra phers to accept the theory that there is a part of the Polar Ocean always open ; hence, indeed, the name Polynia. But neither Maury nor Hayes, we may here observe, could fairly be cited as encouraging the belief that the Gulf Stream, though its influence be ever so extended, may really serve as a means of approach to the North Pole. * The Open Polar Sea (Sampson Low & Co., 1867), p. 317."], [110, "60 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. We only get incidentally, and in a general way, the opinion of Professor C. Wyville Thomson upon these questions. Both he and Dr. Carpenter, in dealing with the subject of ocean currents, have found sufficient in the Gulf Stream to absorb their attention, and, from its important bearing upon our subject, that stream will, further on, demand somewhat more special notice. Professor Wyville Thomson, however, attaches little importance to Behring's Straits in the marvellous economy of cir culation at the North Pole. In an important chapter on the Gulf Stream in his work entitled \"The Depths of the Sea,\" he indeed goes so far as to say (p. 397), that \"The North Atlantic and Arctic seas form together a cul-de-sac closed to the northward, for there is practically no passage for a body of water through Behring's Strait.\" It is easier, perhaps, to cite distinguished autho rities whose speculative notions tend to the belief, particularly, in an open Polar sea, than those of a positively opposite opinion ; yet it is fair to say that the most practical men in Arctic research \u2014 such as Sir George Back, Sir Leopold M'Clintock, Mr. Clements Markham, and especially the late Admiral Osborn\u2014 are exceedingly sceptical upon both of the points we have named. Indeed, the last eminent authority,"], [111, "OPINIONS OF THE GEOGRAPHERS. 61 and a very Sir John Barrow for his zealous advocacy of Northern research, doubted seriously whether there was \" any open sea round our Arctic Pole,\" and was equally sceptical as to any Gulf Stream route to the Pole, though, as an experienced navigator, he was sufficiently convinced of the wide prevalence of what he terms \" the laws of those mysterious cur rents which flow through the waters of the ocean like two mighty rivers \u2014 the Gulf Stream and the Ice Stream ; \" while the accomplished geographer upon whose shoulders his Arctic mantle may be said especially to have descended, looks to sledging expeditions, with ships merely for centres, as the main hope of solving Northern problems even at the Pole itself, and thinks that \"the Gulf Stream slowly mingles with the Polar current, and event ually its waters go south again along the east coast of Greenland, on the surface.\" * While numerous opinions, pro and con, might be cited upon these questions, it could avail little to multiply them, since nothing can be really decided except by actual research. And they may well be submitted to the test of practical inves tigation, if the great mind of Kane was forced, with all his lights, to leave them in abeyance. * Threshold of the Unknown Region, p. 102."], [112, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 62 Undoubtedly, however, the problem of currents is of greater moment in its bearing upon Arctic investigation itself than the question as to whether land or water, the influence of genial climes or the unbroken reign of the frost-king rules at the Pole \u2014 simply because in it is involved the greater ease or greater difficulty of our approach to those regions.

There can be no doubt that we are only just beginning to learn something of the laws which govern ocean-currents. Some among us venture to put faith in the possibility of ascertaining somewhat of the causes, as well as of the force and direction, already gauged, of the winds sweeping over the earth.

In answer to these questions let us distinctly say, that the shrewdest and most prac tical minds among Arctic explorers and experienced geographers are by no means convinced that the route now taken, by Smith Sound and Robeson Channel, is the only practicable one to the North Pole.

Even more than ten years ago, as has been seen, the hope of establishing a practicable sea-passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in the North Frigid Zone had been for ever given up, and the \"great Arctic deside ratum\" namely, the attaining of the North Pole itself, had begun to haunt the minds of men of science, and to be, so to speak, the competitive theme with the leading Geographical Societies. It was not, however, until the year 1865 that the E"], [116, "66 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. subject came prominently before the world, when it was formally brought forward by the Royal Geo graphical Society of London. The question as to the best way of attaining the Pole was inseparably connected with the subject of Arctic exploration itself, in its new and thoroughly scientific aspect. No one doubted the importance of the latter, but upon the first there was much controversy. Ac cordingly, the question of routes took the prece dence, and an active and memorable discussion followed. At a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society of London, held January 23, 1865, Captain Sherard Osborn read his celebrated Memoir \" On the Explo ration of the North Polar Region,\" in which he took strong and definitive grounds in favour of the de spatch of an English expedition by the way of Smith Sound.* At the next meeting, on the 27th of February following, the first letter of Dr. Augus tus Petermann, addressed to the President,! was read, urging upon British geographers the claims of * Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. ix. pp. 42-58. t On the Proposed Expedition to the North Pole.

On both these occasions the subject was freely discussed, but especially at the latter meeting, when the two rival routes to the North Pole had been fairly placed before the world. What had hitherto been a living question merely with geographers and men of science was now become one of universal interest \u2014 an interest, in deed, continued, with only temporary abatement, down to the present time. The plan proposed by Captain Osborn was to proceed in properly provided steam-vessels to Smith Sound, at the head of Baffin's Bay ; to there leave them in safety, and explore northwards along the west coast of Greenland, by means of sledges and boats. And this, it may be parenthetically observed, is substantially the plan of the present English expedition, allowing for a natural enlargement and perfection of scheme consequent upon the advance made in science and Arctic navigation during the last ten years, and the farther penetration towards the Pole by this route of the \" Polaris\" expedition. The project of Dr. Petermann (previously advo cated by General Sabine) provided for trying to reach the North Pole vid Spitzbergen, pushing through the ice-pack to the north of that island in"], [118, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 68 steam-vessels, when, it was contended, no ice bar rier would be found, \" even right under the Pole itself,\" which might not be successfully overcome by an expedition of the modern kind ; while, in the event of an open sea existing at the Pole, an expe dition by the other route, with its ships left behind, would totally fail in the main object. Dr. Peter mann also pleaded the calorific character of the Gulf Stream in recommendation of the route he advocated, and which he considered as being the most favourable for reaching the North Pole. Such, briefly, were the two principal projects of the time. Nor were arguments on either side want ing on the part of zealous advocates. At a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, held in the April following, Mr. C. R. Markham, the secretary, read an elaborate paper on the best route for North Polar exploration/*' in which he brought forward addi tional evidence in support of Osborn's plan, sum ming up his own observations in the following short but salient sentence : \" By the Spitzbergen route there is a bare chance of doing little ; by the Smith Sound route there is a certainty of doing much.\" If strong argument and stirring eloquence could * Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. ix. pp. 138-146."], [119, "THE ARCTIC REVIVAL. 69 have prevailed upon Admiralty Boards in England at this time to undertake the renewal of Arctic enterprise, there can be no doubt that the vast North Polar region would not now be so appro priately denominated a terra incognita. But the want of unanimity regarding routes which pre vailed, as we already know, in English geographical councils was a serious drawback.'\"' And even in regard to the Spitzbergen route, some held that the expedition sought to be organised ought to proceed between Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya, and others that most would be accomplished by coasting along the eastern and northern shores of Greenland.! The latter idea, however, cannot be said to have taken shape till 1867.

But while such was the case, and while all rejoiced at the prospect of reviving the spirit of enterprise and adventure among the seamen of England, the united efforts of the councils of all the leading learned societies were not sufficient to induce the Government to decide the question for themselves of routes, and despatch an Arctic expedition in 1865. Meanwhile the subject thus powerfully revived in England, was not allowed to lie dormant in other countries because of England's unwillingness to re-engage in Arctic enterprise. Germany, France, and America took up the subject. It was quickly proved that the zeal of the distinguished geographer of Gotha (regarded by some in England as discor dant) was not bounded by his efforts to induce England to send an expedition into the European Polar seas. In spite of the paralysing influence upon ordinary enterprises of three successive wars involving his nation, this man of science pushed forward his scheme for a German Arctic expedition, and curiously enough, almost in the midst of dire international strife, made Arctic exploration a school for recruiting an infant German navy. The experiences of the two German expeditions"], [121, "THE ARCTIC REVIVAL. 71 have contributed an interesting and valuable chapter to the history of Arctic enterprise ; but it must be confessed that one looks in vain through the annals of those voyages for any development of the favourite route of their projector, so stoutly con tended for through four-and-twenty years ; while, unhappily, they failed to do much, if anything, towards solving for us the great Arctic pro blem. They were undertaken, it is true \u2014 certainly the first German expedition \u2014 with the object of getting as near to the Pole as possible ; but with the excep tion of Koldeway's tentative effort above Spitzber gen in 1868, they failed by close upon 5\u00b0 in reaching as high a latitude as had been attained nearly three centuries before by Barents and Hudson ; while, on the east coast of Greenland, Dutch whalers sighted considerably higher points in 1655 and 1670 than did the Second German Expedition. The experience of the latter of \" perils,\" too, off the east coast of Greenland (allowing poetical latitude to partial annalists), \" compared with which even Barents' wondrous boat voyage from Novaya Zemlya pales, and Kane's escape from Smith Sound sinks to the dimensions of a boating excursion,\" was, we have no doubt, far from the realisation of"], [122, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 72 the hopes of Dr. Petermann. Nor was there any thing achieved by it that would entitle the East Coast of Greenland to take rank as a fourth Polar route. Professor Geikie, however, appears to have thus distinguished it in his Life of Sir Roderick Murchison (vol. ii. p. 301). But it is just to say that these expeditions were, comparatively speaking, only feebly pro vided, according to the English view of what an Arctic expedition should be.* In France \u2014 the country of La Perouse and Bel lot, yet really so strange to Arctic work \u2014 a very different route from either that of Osborn or of Dr. Petermann gained the attention of geographers ; and, not less than in England and Germany, was the movement in favour of an expedition accredit able to one man.

No record of baffled attempts, however, even had not later investigations, and indeed individual re- search, lent encouragement to his views, could have deterred an enthusiastic Frenchman like Gustave Lambert, who, as M. Vivien de Saint- Martin has said, was at once a man of action and a man of science. Nor would it appear that the conception of his expedition having Behring's Straits for its route, was in any real sense the outcome of the English discussion upon this subject. It was con- ceived, it is only just to say, in complete ignorance, as M. Malte-Brun tells us, of the projects of Osborn and Petermann, and the ground over which it would be necessary to proceed was suggested to the pro jector by the sight of the thin ice covering the Polar Sea to the north-west of Behring's Straits, about 73\u00b0 N., promising apparently a passage to the mariner bold enough to advance right through"], [124, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 74 it, together with the appearance of the physical state of the sea in those high latitudes, the pro bable effect of insolation, and, finally, the infor mation he was able to draw from the scattered traditions of Arctic navigators.* But in touching upon the scheme thus conceived for an expedition by Behring's Straits, we are in stinctively led to go through the history, even although the briefest possible account may seem like a digression here. Returning from those seas to France \u2014 armed at all points with considerations both theoretical and practical in support of his scheme \u2014 M. Lambert discerned in the public atten tion which had been drawn to the subject of Arctic exploration by Captain Osborn and Dr. Petermann only a new motive for emulation. To his delight, moreover, he found that the Royal Geographical Society of London was engaged in confirming and applying almost his own theories ; though he still drew, from a thorough study of the history of the Franklin search expeditions, new and important inductions in favour of his own project.

After the complete endorsement of the undertaking by the Geographical Society and the Scientific Association of France, if anything was wanting to secure for it the popular favour, that object would seem to have been gained in the characteristic encouragement given to the project by the Emperor, who himself * See, for list, &c, Gustave Lambert au Pole Nord.

Enthusiasm, however ardent, proverbially cools at sight of subscription lists, and the fact of a large amount of money being required to carry out the scheme left its projector an arduous task to per form ; so that neither \" with the violets of 1869 \" (as Captain Osborn had hoped), nor with those of 1870, was M. Lambert enabled to witness the departure of his expedition. That \"happy point,\" unfortunately, was never attained. Unhappily for the cause of science, and perhaps for the national glory of the most scientific of peoples, the threshold of the unknown region was not destined to be overstepped by France, or at least the day for the despatch of an Arctic expedi tion by her was to be indefinitely postponed. Events but too fresh in the recollection of Europe advanced with maelstrom fury, and took by surprise, not only the French Arctic Expedition, but France itself; and the unhappy death of the chief promoter of the enterprise in the siege of Paris, caused the abandon ment of an undertaking intended to prove one of"], [129, "THE ARCTIC REVIVAL. 79 the three routes to the Pole, which at this period engaged the attention of the world.

We may, however, first observe that, if apologies seem almost necessary for the considerable space we have already unexpectedly devoted to this once-proposed Behring's Straits expedi tion, let it be remembered that its patriot projector is well entitled to all the honour we can pay to his memory, and indeed \u2014 having con ceived his project on Arctic ground \u2014 may well claim to rank among the \" Heroes of the Arctic,\" almost by the side of Barents, Hall, and Franklin.

The circumstances resulting from the war, in all probability, likewise prevented the despatch of a third German expedition, which was promised about the same time by Dr. Petermann, to be sustained by the liberality of an opulent Bremen merchant. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that this will yet be equipped. In the year 1868 another attempt was made by the advocates of English Arctic enterprise to bring about the despatch of an expedition. A second paper, by Captain Osborn, favouring the route by Smith Sound, was read before the Geo- graphical Society of London, wherein was urged more strongly than ever the expediency of pursu- ing this route ; especially since the investigations that had meanwhile been made by Torrell and Nordenskiold around Spitzbergen were deemed to be adverse to the prospect of successful efforts in that direction. All arguments, however, were still unavailing with the British Government. But the universal interest by this time awakened in the \"three projects\" caused the friends of Arctic enterprise in the United States to determine that the peculiarly American route VOL. I.

Urged on by his zeal for ethnological and kindred studies \u2014 a zeal to which the present writer can bear witness, as having heard the self-sacrificing explorer recount his experiences among the Eskimos, sur rounded by living and other illustrations of his in dustrious research \u2014 Captain Hall began mooting, almost before the embers of civil strife had cooled, the plans for a new American Arctic expedition, to proceed by Smith Sound and Kennedy Channel en route to the Pole.

It was, therefore, due to the energetic influence of such men, supported by men of science, with Professor Joseph Henry, President of the National Academy of Sciences, at their head, that Captain Hall was enabled to obtain the means for carrying forward this undertaking, which must ever redound to the honour of the United States. * Arctic Experiences.

In 1867, Captain Long of the \" Nile,\" together with three other enterprising American whaling captains \u2014 Raynor of the \" Reindeer,\" Fhillips of the \" Monticello,\" Bliven of the \" Nautilus \" \u2014 saw or discovered Wrangall Land (believed, however, to have been previously sighted by Kellett), and give us certain points well fixed by astronomical observations. American whalemen, indeed, have pushed their enterprises far into the Arctic Ocean by Behring's Straits, and coasted extensive high lands to the north of Siberia as far as latitude 74\u00b0, in, it is thought, the sea first seen by Wrangall; though Cook and Clerke (1778-79) considered they had reached the extreme limit of navigation in these seas by attaining Icy Cape (in lat. 70\u00b0 30' N.) on the American coast, and North Cape (in 69\u00b0 N. lat.) on the Asiatic side. It is worthy of note, too, that in seas regarded impenetrable by these earlier navigators, the Americans established a highly profitable whale fishery, realising as much (according to Dr. Petermann) as $8,000,000 in two years. The exploration of Wrangall Land by Captain Long, it may be mentioned, has been pointed out by the Italian geographer, Signor Guido Cora (in his \" Cosmos \"), as the only instance of research"], [136, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 86 It may be too much to hope that such an expedi tion will spring up in the busy Centennial year ; but it would be surely a crowning honour if, after centuries of vain endeavour, American spirit should be able to write the Archimedian word of the North Polar secret on the last page of our hundred years of history. that has been made within the last fifteen years between the estuary of the Yenisei on the one side and Lancaster Sound on the other, or almost half the circumference of the Polar circle. Captain Long, too\u2014 a veritable Scoresby of the later time \u2014 enunciated the opinion that, if ever a transit be made between the Eastern and Western Oceans, it will not be by lines hitherto tried, but by an enterprise directed from Behring's Straits. The result of his in vestigations and discoveries, together with some very sensible suggestions, were communicated by him to the \" Pacific Com mercial Advertiser\" of Honolulu in 1868, and were honoured by being embodied with considerable detail in Sir Roderick Murchison's annual address before the Royal Geographical Society in the same year, as well as being given at length in Petermann's \" Geographische Mittheilungen.\" We may, moreover, here observe that Captain Long claimed what ever merit there was (applying, it is presumed, to the route) in the project of Octave Pave, a young Louisianan of French extraction, who in the summer of 1871 created some excitement in the geo graphical world by his scheme for going to the North Pole on an indiarubber raft via Cape Yakan. The scene of this farcical proposal was San Francisco ; and we cannot but recommend, seriously and in all modesty, to the enterprising merchants of that wealthy city to redeem its fair name from the trifling slur thus cast upon it, by fitting out a genuine and strong expedition, to be placed, perhaps, under Government control, to try this route.

While pronouncing that proposed by France as \"undoubtedly the boldest and most audacious,\" the \"chief obstacle\" to the English plan is, he says, \"the great expenditure of time and force \" imposed by the Smith Sound route. And as to the remaining project he observes : \"By the German plan there is less distance be fore arriving upon the theatre of first operations, fewer dangers and obstacles than by Smith Sound ; but in moving from the last base of the expedition, the unknown and unforeseen with all their rigours stare one in the face \u2014 still there would then be the joy and glory in case of triumph.\" * * Les Trois Projets d'Exploration au Pole Nord, p. 146, et seq."], [138, "88 CHAPTER VII.

While the Smith Sound route has continued to be further tried by American explorers, and is now the chosen route of the \" Alert \" and \" Discovery \" expedition, it should be remembered that the Spitzbergen seas have been almost annually visited by adventurous Arctic voyagers, particularly the Swedes and Norwegians ; and every argument that"], [139, "THE GULF STREAM ROUTE. 89 was used in favour of this direction in the active days of route discussion holds good at the pre sent time. The facts upon which the course of the English expedition has been determined all tend to show that it is to the North-east the search for an open Polar sea and for Polar secrets must be directed ; that the winds which keep the pack broken and moving sweep from that quarter down through Robeson Channel ; and the British expedition is gone to meet the current which from that channel passes south through Davis Strait. Whence comes that current, however ? How does it reach the circumpolar region in such a state that it carries before it, on its return circuit, such enormous masses of ice ? The answer men have furnished is plain. The Gulf Stream that laves the coast of Britain, saving her populations \" from the paralysing rigours of a Labrador winter \" \u2014 to use the late Admiral Osborn 's words \u2014 passes up between Novaya Zemlya and Spitzbergen, bearing drift-wood, the marine plants which grow only in mild temperatures, and innu merable other of its treasure stores ; some of which it deposits on those far Northern coasts, while other tribute is borne still onward, and is found at points"], [140, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 90 more to the west ; thus pointing out, to all theo retical appearance, a channel polewards. \" It has long been known,\" to quote a learned American reviewer, \" ever since Dr. Franklin was a commissioner of the Colonies at the British Court in ante-revolutionary times, that the Gulf Stream, or at least a branch of it, flowed to the A_rctic regions by the way of Spitzbergen, thus indicating to the explorer the true way to the Pole, as unerr ingly as the wild buffalo of the West points out to the hunter, by its beaten paths, the easiest and best routes through the Rocky Mountains ; and yet, strange to say, all the Polar navigators, from Parry to Dr. Kane, have ignored this fact, and sought passages to the Pole in vain, far to the westward, by the way of Davis Strait and Baffin's Bay. Whilst Nature has been beckoning them on to the true thermal gateway to the Pole, they have cast their eyes in a different direction, and wandered about in culs-de-sac, only to be baffled and wearied, and driven back by impassable barriers of ice as often as they have made the attempt.\" * To quote, likewise, Professor T.

He seems, too, almost instinctively to have been persuaded of the existence of some such passage, but the then incomplete state of scientific knowledge precluded that brave seaman from its discovery, unless haply he could have fallen in with it by a species of im mortal accident. The \" gateway \" so narrowly missed, however, in that case, by Barents, was, it is claimed, actually pursued to a high latitude by the Austro-Hungarians, Lieutenant Weyprecht of the Navy, and First Lieutenant Julius Payer of the Engineers, in 1871, who found an open sea before them, and the services to science of these gallant Arctic explorers have not been overlooked, even by nationalities foreign to their own.

Their names, however, have become more especially familiar to us in association with Arctic voyaging because of the expedition under their charge, of which all knowledge was lost for two years, until in 1874 the heroes of the ill-fated \"Tegethoff\" were rescued in the Bay of Downs (Novaya Zemlya), after undergoing perils very similar to those encountered by Barents and Heems kerk three hundred years before ; though, curiously enough, Novaya Zemlya proved the rescue of the former rather than the scene of their dreary impri sonment. But now to speak of the first expedition. Sail ing with the object we have indicated, Lieutenants Weyprecht and Payer left Tromso on June 21st, 1871, in a hired Norwegian sloop of only 70 tons, and a crew, all included, of eight souls. On the 21st of August they had reached latitude 77\u00b0 17' N., in longitude 28\u00b0 E. The ice between the 28th and 36th meridian of longitude was looser and thinner than they had previously met with ; so much so, that they declared that a strong steamer would have had no difficulty in taking a straight course through the ice, particularly between meridians 28\u00b0 and 32\u00b0 E., where it was thinnest. On the 29th of August,"], [145, "THE GULF STREAM ROUTE. 95 in 77\u00b0 30' N., longitude 42\u00b0 E., they were surprised by the entire absence of ice. On the night of Sep tember 1st they attained, within loose ice, their highest latitude, by the log, in 78\u00b0 48' N. ; and although this cannot be considered as an extraordi nary point to have attained, it should be stated that obstacles other than ice prevented their farther northward progress, such as the fog, which was very thick, and a strong head- wind, together with want of provisions, the unwillingness of the crew to ad vance farther, and a damaged stem. \" The ice,\" their preliminary report states, \" would not have been an obstacle.\" It now remained a question with them whether the region thus free of ice which they traversed was only a bight in the ice or the open Polar Sea. They believed it to be the latter ; and, to convince them selves of it, next ran down on a south-easterly course to 75\u00b0 44' N., in longitude 52\u00b0 E. There was no ice whatever to be seen in their course below the 78th parallel of latitude up to the coast of Novaya Zemlya. \" The fact,\" their report goes on to say, \" that a small sailing vessel could, without encountering great impediments, go almost, beyond the 79 th degree of latitude, which nowhere has yet"], [146, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 96 been reached by a ship except by the west of Spitzbergen, * will, by itself, prove the Novaya Zemlya sea to be the most favourable basis for attempts to reach the Pole.\" They returned to Tromso on the 4th of October. It is worthy of note that the change in the water from a higher to a lower temperature, as indicated by their report, appears to have been a very rapid one, particularly near the northern limit of the voyage, and occurred most frequently when in closest proximity to the ice, so that they were enabled in the thickest fog to run close up to the barrier, guided by the thermometer. The experience of the Austro-Hungarians in 1871, however, was not altogether singular. The year was undoubtedly remarkable as a most exceptional one for \" openness.\" Nor was it less memorable by reason of the numberless craft of the bold Scan dinavians themselves which this year dotted the Novaya Zemlya and Spitzbergen seas with their sails ; these daring fishermen, while in the pursuit of their legitimate calling, never failing to add to our store of Arctic knowledge ; and only two weeks * Captain Hall about the same time took his ship as high as lati tude 82\u00b0 16' N., by Smith Sound."], [147, "THE GULF STREAM ROUTE. 97 after the discovery, if such it may be termed, of Weyprecht and Payer, Captain Mack, a Norwegian, in another small fishing vessel, ran about 300 miles to the south-eastward in a sea similarly open, thus indicating, apparently, that they had completely pierced the ice-belt on the path of the Gulf Stream. Captain Mack, indeed, by the help of a strong cur rent running east, having a temperature of 44\u00b0 Fahr., sailed beyond the 80th degree of longitude. This was on September 12th, and only the day before another Norwegian fisherman, Johannesen, expe rienced similar freedom of movement in even a little higher latitude.

The fact that the ship of the Austro-Hungarians was certainly carried northward (though they distinctly attribute this to the wind and not to the current) may not unreasonably be claimed as showing the existence of the Gulf Stream, or of some other strong northward surface current, in this locality more than probable, and this might still with profit be further treated. Until, at any rate, the Arctic flood-gate of the Gulf Stream shall be actually found and scrutinised with the same pertinacious zeal and industry as Captain Nares will bestow upon his work ; and until it shall be demonstrated that twice the force which bears an ice-continent onward as a toy is incapable of carrying a ship, let it be confessed that much re- mains undone and unattempted which is manifestly within the reach of human attainment.

Faith in the trustworthiness of the early accounts of high latitudes declared to have been attained by Dutch whalers was greatly revived, just a century ago, by the writings of the Honourable Daines Barrington, a Fellow of the Royal Society. This author, believing in the possibility of attaining the North Pole, industriously collected all that he could find upon the subject of these too mythi- cal voyages, and communicated the result of his investigations to the Royal Society. He also embraced the same in his \" Tracts on the Pro- bability of reaching the North Pole;\" and a no less distinguished naval officer than Admiral Fitzroy has expressed confidence in their credi- bility, and declared it as his opinion that the papers of Daines Barrington embodying these accounts \u2014 first printed about the time the latter was labouring for the despatch of Captain Phipps' expedition, and reprinted in 1818, when Polar"], [156, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 106 voyaging was revived in England\u2014 were entitled to more attention than they had received.\"\"\" Whether this be so or not, Hollanders are cer tainly under greater obligation to that savant for his painstaking inquiries than certain of his own countrymen, anxious for the adoption of the Smith Sound route, have, on their own part, been willing to allow \u2014 if only because of the earnest way in which he defended the truthfulness of the really authentic Dutch narrations.! It was seriously asserted in the accounts cited by Daines Barrington that Dutch ships had reached the immediate vicinity of the Pole ; that they had there found an open sea, a comparatively warm temperature, and a swell and a roll of the sea indicating a broad, unobstructed expanse of water.

There are, indeed, one or two instances given by Commodore Jansen of high Northern latitudes claimed to have been reached by Dutchmen which may be noticed in passing, particularly as the re marks connected with them tend to lead us back to the subject with which we are more especially engaged. He mentions the story of the captain of a Dutch man-of-war, waiting at Spitzbergen to protect the homeward-bound fleet, who, having some time at his disposal, and finding open water, ran as far as 89\u00b0 N. ; but, as in most of these cases, the account is unsupported by evidence. The remark, however,"], [160, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 110 follows, that this only shows the general belief which then existed that there was no land to prevent any one from sailing to the Pole, and that it might be done if there was open water. \" When our whalers,\" to quote the words of our Dutch authority, \" drifted from 79-^\u00b0 in eighteen days, 2\u00b0 towards the south, attached to a large ice-field forty miles long, and did it in one season two or three times, they saw that there was always a continuity of these ice-fields ; and they calculated that, as during the summer season from the 1st of June till the 31st of August, or five times eighteen days, five times the length of the ice-fields must drift south, the breadth of the pack must be 10\u00b0 of latitude, or the dis- tance to the Pole ; and that if there was a passage for the ice, there would be one for ships under favourable circumstances. Therefore Torus Carolus says, ' Whether there is a passage, God only knows ; but if any, it must be sought here.'\"'5'' The Burgomaster Witsen, moreover, after a close investigation of the highest latitudes reached by the Dutch whalers, comes to the conclusion that none has ever been higher on the Novaya Zemlya * \" Notes on the Ice between Greenland and Nova Zembla : being the Result of Investigations into the Records of Early Dutch Voy ages in the Spitzbergen Seas.

But he cites, as being \" informed with certainty,\" the high latitude said to have been attained by Cornells Roule, in the longitude of Novaya Zemlya who found land, birds, and also open water. This information, says Commodore Jansen, appears to have been received by Witsen after his book \" On North-East Europe and Asia \" was in the hands of the printer (1705), so that he had no time to make inquiry, and we have had to take the account of Roule's voyage from Witsen in this imperfect form.* Altogether, there is much of apparent fact and of indisputable logic connected with these accounts. Certainly, could they be depended upon, there would be reason for supposing that a strong northward current had helped the Dutch whalers to attain their high latitudes, and another argument would be afforded for the route we have proposed. At * When making his investigations, Commodore Jansen found a speech made by the learned Pontanus in 1646, in which he says that it is much warmer in 82\u00b0 north of Novaya Zemlya than in 76\u00b0 ; but he adds that it is difficult to get there, and still more so to get back ; and Pontanus, therefore \u2014 who was evidently a member of the \" Opposition \" of those days\u2014 did not advise \" any one to try to reach Cathay by that route \" (Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. ix. p. 163)."], [162, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 112 all events, let us heartily endorse the suggestion and echo the prayer embraced in the couplet which we find appended to the account of Witsen : \u2014 \"go and see if this is true, And may God protect the explorers ! \""], [163, "CHAPTER IX.

This renders obvious the necessity of an alternative being found for the route we have proposed. But before suggesting the alternative let us glance at our subject in one or two other aspects. There is only too strong evidence that the Polar pack, met with to the north of Spitzbergen, and indeed for a wide circuit, is comparatively continuous. This may be the case even directly over the track of the Gulf Stream (assuming it to be a surface current), owing to the accumu lation of vast masses of ice ; which would even admit of a veritable \"river\" running, beneath the body, provided the accumulative tendency be greater than the power of the stream to clear its own course, or rather to bear away the ice upon its bosom. Yet it can hardly be possible, one would think, that temporary openings, in the line of the north ward current or currents, may not exist, which, if found, would enable a comparatively easy pas sage to be made with a steam vessel to the Pole"], [165, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 115 in favourable seasons. The latter may, however, in this sense, be very exceptional. Neverthe less the weighty opinions we have cited, tending to the belief that the Gulf Stream might and pro bably would facilitate the approach to the Pole, were the route to be thoroughly investigated, should constitute some warrant for the trial being made. Again, no Arctic expedition should consist of less than two good ships having steam-power ; * and, doubtless, one season's exploration by a well planned expedition would prove sufficient to indi cate pretty clearly whether success or defeat is to be the reward on this line of research (though if an opening readily presented itself, the Pole would of course soon be reached).

If the stem is straight or perpendicular, the vessel brings up with a heavy thud, which is very damaging to her.

Such an Arctic \" Challenger Expedition \" would return with its own peculiar fruits, and would assuredly earn the gratitude of the scientific world. It should be remembered that, with all we have heard respecting the Gulf Stream theory, and in spite of the efforts of the Austro-Hungarians, no thorough or practical test of its worth has yet been made ; and the scientific value of the trial, directed by men such as Holland could employ in this work, would, not to speak of the honour of conducting so important an enterprise, be well worth the cost of the experiment. Even Captain Osborn, and for England too, \" fully recognised the importance of a ship or ships being sent to follow up the course of the Gulf Stream ; \" and declared that so mys terious a stream, \" equal to. fifty Niles in volume and length,\" ought, \" for a thousand reasons,\" to stimulate the sailors of a sailor-nation to trace it to its farthest extent. Let us, however, look at the Gulf Stream, con sidered apart even from its bearing on our general subject. The day is past for regarding this stream as having an existence only in the fertile brains of theorists. Both its existence and its great"], [167, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 117 influence as an ocean current are now generally con ceded ; and the importance of ascertaining its pre sence in high Northern latitudes, even beyond the Arctic barrier, cannot but be regarded as a matter of scientific importance, second only, perhaps, to that of exploring those mysterious regions themselves. In glancing at an interesting or important theme, historical illustrations usually add force, and cer tainly lend attraction to the subject ; and even with respect to the Gulf Stream, Professor Thompson B. Maury has arrayed such illustrations in a striking manner, though perhaps not the most pertinently. In proof of what does not take place with the Gulf Stream he says : \" Fourteen times, in the last eight hundred years, has the Thames been frozen over. Fairs have occasionally been held, booths built, and oxen roasted upon it. Since 1294 the Baltic has been eight times frozen over ; once so firmly that Charles X. led his whole army over it from Holstein to Denmark. Twice in the history of Flanders wine has been cut with hatchets. In 1708, ice in the harbour of Copenhagen was twenty-seven inches thick. In 1794, Pichegru encamped on the ice in Holland. The Zuyder Zee, the Hellespont, the harbour of Leghorn, Marseilles, and Genoa, the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube, the Scheldt, the"], [168, "1 1 8 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. Seine, and the Po have at times been locked in ice. Never were even the edges of the Gulf Stream stiffened with frost. We have no account of its slightest congelation in any part of its vast area, not even off the shores of Norway or Novaya Zemlya.\" This extract forcibly illustrates an obvious fact, which may be said indeed to apply to the whole briny expanse of the ocean. But as for this re markable current in the sea, it is hardly possible to exaggerate its importance and singularity. This marvellous river in the Atlantic has, in reality, for more than a century been a wonder to mankind. Compared with it, as to size, the largest of other rivers are but mere gossamer threads, Captain Livingston, an early investigator of this subject, putting it down as three thousand times larger than the Mississippi. In 1775, Doctor Franklin, who brought light ning from the clouds, discerned also the reality of this warm river in the ocean, and the use that might be made of it by the frosted mariner in winter as a convenient refuge from the blinding snowstorms, and as a means of giving him his longitude, and warning him of his approach to this continent. Its peculiarity and wondrous influence, indeed,"], [169, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 119 have been attested by all eminent observers in physical science. Professor Tyndall (in one of his lectures delivered before the Eoyal Society) says of it, \"This stream entirely abolishes the differ ences of temperature due to the difference of lati tude of North and South Britain, and renders the harbour of Hammerfest in Norway (71\u00b0 N.) clear of ice all winter.\" * Ansted describes it as \" a great and wide stream of water, larger than all the rivers of the world to gether, running in a definite channel, through colder water of a different colour, so that, when a ship enters the stream in smooth water, one may see the bows dashing the spray from the warm and dark blue waters she is entering, while the stern is within the pale green and cold waters of the Banks of Newfoundland.\" Professor C. Wyville Thomson, moreover, has given considerable study to this subject, and has furnished us with the results of the more important observations regarding the Gulf Stream. t In dis tinctive terms he describes what he understands to be the Gulf Stream as follows\u2014 viz., as \" that mass * Heat as a Mode of Motion, p. 197. f The Depths of the Sea.

The path of that por tion which trends north-eastwards is determined, according to his view, he says, by the great initial velocity of the equatorial water which escapes from the Straits of Florida. The glory of the Gulf Stream as it issues from the straits has, as Professor Wyville Thomson observes, been the theme of every physical geographer ; a theme, it may be said, immeasurably enhanced in grandeur when the stream is considered as temper ing the atmosphere over a vast area of the northern hemisphere. But neither ita grandeur nor its heat-giving influence is easy to portray in words."], [171, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 121 Perhaps figures may best serve for this purpose, though these can scarce be comprehended. Mr. James Croll,_in an important paper on Ocean Currents in relation to the distribution of heat over the globe, in the \" Philosophical Magazine,\"* cited indeed by Professor Wyville Thomson, enters into a minute examination of the amount of heat con veyed by the Gulf Stream from the Tropics into the Temperate and Arctic regions. Mr. Croll cal culates the Gulf Stream as equal to a stream of water 50 miles broad and 1000 feet deep flowing at a rate of 4 miles an hour, consequently convey ing 5,575,680,000,000 cubic feet- of water per hour, or 133,816,320,000,000 cubic feet per day. This mass of water has a mean temperature of 18\u00b0 C. as it passes out of the gulf, and on its northern journey it is cooled down to 4\u00b0*5, thus losing heat to the amount of 13\u00b0*5 C. The total quantity of heat, therefore, transferred from the equatorial regions per day amounts to something like 154,959,300,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds. In more general terms Professor Maury has illustrated this ; the tenacity also with which the Gulf Stream retains its heat to gradually impart it for ameliorating the climate of North-Western * See \" Philosophical Magazine \" for February 1870."], [172, "122 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE: Europe, and melting the ices of the Arctic, consti tutes not its least wonder. He says, \" Mathe matical calculations show that the heat actually set free in a winter's day by the Gulf Stream is enough to warm up the whole column of atmo sphere resting on France and the British Islands from the freezing-point to summer heat ; \" * and Lieutenant Maury says that the latent heat set free by precipitation, over England, in one day, when the wind is from the westward, is equal to that created by the combustion of all the coal consumed in the island throughout a whole year.\" Professor Wyville Thomson declares the Gulf Stream to be nearly uniform in temperature throughout the greater part of its depth. He further observes that \"keeping in view* the enormous influence which ocean currents exercise in the dis tribution of climates at the present time, I think it is scarcely going too far to suppose that such currents \u2014 movements communicated to the water by the constant winds \u2014 existed at all geological periods as the great means, I had almost said the sole means, of producing a general oceanic circu lation, and thus distributing heat in the ocean.\" * So calculated by Principal J.

By it the laws of equal winter temperature are curved from their normal position 1600 miles northwardly. This striking feature in the effect of the Gulf Stream is well illustrated in the isothermal charts of Dr. Petermann, Berghaus, Dove, Keith Johnson, Sir Charles Lyell, and also the interesting isother mal chart of the North Atlantic basin of Professor Wyville Thomson, but notably in the charts of Dr. Petermann accompanying an important article on the Gulf Stream ;* the series of the latter embodying the results of the reduction of 100,000 well-authenticated observations of the surface tern - perature of the principal inhabited portions of the northern hemisphere. From what we have said, moreover, respecting this abnormal curve in the line of temperature, the reader may perhaps derive some advantage in picturing it to himself by a glance * Der Golf-Strom und Standpunkt der thermometrischen Kennt niss des Nord-Atlantischen Oceans und Landgebietes im Jahre 1870.

There are a variety of theories respecting the origin of the Gulf Stream which we should not entirely overlook in connection with a special men tion of this subject. A deep-rooted opinion in the minds of men so far back as Dr. Franklin's time, and one repeated by him, was that which held that the Gulf Stream is the escaping of the waters that have been forced into the Caribbean Sea by the trade winds, and that it originates in the pressure of those winds upon the water which drives up into that sea-head, as it were, for this stream. Professor C. Wyville Thomson has, as already seen, attributed the Gulf Stream to much the same cause. Both he and Dr. Carpenter have a good right to speak upon this subject, it maybe observed, from their connection with the Deep-Sea Dredging ex peditions of recent years in the North Atlantic, un dertaken by the Admiralty at the instance of the Council of the Royal Society, and which have been conducted with such profitable results ; yet it is noticeable that these two men of science here differ radically \u2014 and, indeed, \" agree to differ \" \u2014 in their opinions."], [175, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 125 We have already noticed that Professor Wyville Thomson regards the waters of the Atlantic forced northward by the Gulf Stream as practically for bidden an outlet through the Arctic Ocean, and hence that the current must find its way back again after performing its great function of tem pering the climate of North - Western Europe, and perhaps to no little extent the Arctic regions ; \"burrowing downwards\" \u2014 as Dr. Carpenter 'has criticisingly termed the process \u2014 into the deep trough of the mid- Atlantic in its return circuit, and yielding to the northward flow. He cites Humboldt in support of his opinion, who considered that he demonstrated, in 1812, that the low temperature of the tropical seas at great depths could only be owing to the currents from the Poles to the Equator ; and D'Aubuisson, in 1819, he says, also attributed the low temperature of the sea at great depths at or near the equator to the flow of currents from the Poles. He compares the North Atlantic \u2014 having a depth off the west coast of Iceland of at least 4800 feet \u2014 to a bath, with the Gulf Stream as a vast supply pipe whence issues forth a ceaseless volume of hot water, and says : \" Into the corner of this basin, as into a bath \u2014 with a north-easterly direction"], [176, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 126 given to it by its initial velocity, as if the supply pipe of the bath were turned so as to give the hot water a definite impulse \u2014 this enormous flood is poured, day and night, winter and summer. When the basin is full \u2014 and not till then \u2014 overcoming its northern impulse, the surplus water turns south wards in a southern eddy, so that there is a certain tendency for the hot water to accumulate in the northern basin, to ' bank down ' along the north eastern coasts. \"It is scarcely necessary to say that for every unit of water which enters the basin of the North Atlantic, and which is not evaporated, an equivalent must return. As cold water can gravitate into the deeper parts of the ocean from all directions, it is only under peculiar circumstances that any move ment having the character of a current is induced ; these circumstances occur, how*ever, in the confined and contracted communication between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Sea. Between Cape Fare well and the North Cape there are only two chan nels of any considerable depth, the one very narrow along the east coast of Iceland, and the other along the east coast of Greenland. The shallow part of the sea is entirely occupied, at all events during summer, by the warm water of the Gulf Stream,"], [177, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 127 except at one point, where a rapid current of cold water, very restricted and very shallow, sweeps round the south of Spitzbergen, and then slips under the Gulf Stream water at the northern entrance of the German Ocean.\" * The seeming conflict of currents along the Arctic barrier, between Novaya Zemlya and Greenland, is another notable feature in the economy of ocean circulation of the North Atlantic. It is a well-ascertained fact that a strong current, termed by some geographers the Arctic Current, runs downward along the east coast of Greenland. This is believed to originate in the masses of ice which surround the North Pole, whence it runs along the coast of Greenland to Cape Farewell. Having doubled this cape, it flows up the west coast of Greenland to about latitude 66\u00b0 N., when it turns to the south along the coast of Labrador. It eventually joins the Gulf Stream between lati tude 44\u00b0 and 47\u00b0 N., and is the means of streAving the Atlantic Ocean with the immense icebergs which are often observable in the summer from the steamers plying between New York and Liver pool. It has been calculated that 20,000 square miles * The Depths of the Sea, pp. 398, 399."], [178, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 128 of ice-drift are annually brought by it along the coast of Greenland to Cape Farewell, or are carried into warmer regions, where they gradually dissolve and disappear.\"1' But to return to the Gulf Stream. Professor Wyville Thomson cites Professor Buff as entertain ing substantially his own view \u2014 to wit, that the movement of the Gulf Stream is traceable to the trade-winds. And Mr. A. G. Findlay, a high autho rity on all hydrographic matters, is pointed to as admitting, in a paper on the Gulf Stream, read before the Royal Geographical Society of London,! that the temperature of North-Eastern Europe is abnormally ameliorated by a surface-current of the warm water of the Atlantic which reaches it, and also as contending that the Gulf Stream proper \u2014 that is to say, the water injected, as it were, into the Atlantic through the Straits of Florida by the im pulse of the trade- winds \u2014 becomes entirely thinned out, dissipated, and lost opposite the Newfoundland banks, about latitude 45\u00b0 N. The warm water of the southern portion of the North Atlantic basin is still carried northwards ; but Mr. Findlay, says * The Imperial Gazetteer. Edited by W. G. Blackie, Ph.D., F.R.G.S.

Blunt, a well-known American hydrographer, in a resume of this subject, contained in the journal of the American Geographical and Statistical Society for 1870, expresses an opinion quite in accord with Mr. Findlay. He speaks of the Gulf Stream as \"that much misrepresented current of the ocean, which body has to bear with the inventions of Maury, the stupidity of weather predictors, and the assumptions of meteorologists,\" adding that he does not believe that it has any existence \"beyond the Western Islands,\" and that \" the Gulf Stream, as a current, entirely ceases and loses all its equatorial heat to the eastward of the longitude of 40\u00b0 W.\" Mr. Larnont, however, bears this direct testimony to its existence in the higher latitudes : \"I am positive that I have seen the current running among the Thousand Islands at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour.\"t * The Depths of the Sea, p. 390. f Seasons with the Sea-Horses ; or, Sporting Adventures in the Northern Seas (London : Hurst & Blackest, 1861), p. 165.

Nor should we omit wholly the opinion of so eminent an authority in the domain of physical science as the late Sir Charles Lyell, although we do not find his name associated with the recent special discussion of this subject, by which the Gulf -Stream has been raised to the dignity of a \" controverted question.\" Let us, however, in the first place, note his views. Sir Charles Lyell expresses the opinion, too, that this great current is chiefly caused by the trade winds. He appears to have adopted the conclu sion of Rennell, that the Gulf Stream arises from a combination of circumstances occasioned mainly by the northward flow of a branch of the Mozam bique current into the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, ' ' which are also supposed to be heaped up by the blowing of the north-east trade-winds. \"* With him, no less than with the majority of other * Principles of Geology.

Dr. Carpenter's position is that, in the first place, the obstructions offered by the Isthmus of Panama and Central America to the passage of the equatorial current from the Atlantic to the Pacific in no way contribute towards the production of the Gulf Stream ; and, in the second place, that the heat of the Gulf Stream has no influence in elevating the climate of Europe and the British Islands. He entertains a strong opinion \u2014 much the same, indeed, as Mr. Findlay \u2014 that the dispersion of the Gulf Stream may be said to be complete in about latitude 45\u00b0 N. and longitude 35\u00b0 W. ; and though that stream itself cannot affect the climate of North- Western Europe, that nevertheless its mild ness is due to the movement of equatorial water in a north-easterly direction. He indeed attributes all movements of ocean-water of great magnitude to \"a general convective circulation, and of this general circulation he regards the Gulf Stream as a peculiarly modified case.\"* Dr. Carpenter questions the correctness of the doctrine, according to Professor Wyville Thomson, that the north-east flow is an extension or pro- * The Depths of the Sea, p. 384."], [183, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 133 longation of the Gulf Stream, still driven on by the vis a tergo of the trade-winds, adopted and strongly defended by the latter. He believes that the northward flow of the waters would, as he himself states, and as already shown, continue even \"if the North and South American continents were so completely disunited that the equatorial currents would be driven straight onward by the trade winds into the Pacific Ocean, instead of being embayed in the Gulf of Mexico, and driven out in a north-east direction through the narrows off Cape Florida.\"* Upon the theory which Dr. Carpenter bases his opinion \u2014 while not endorsing Mr. Findlay 's views, attributing the movement beyond the 45th parallel of latitude entirely to the drift of the anti-trades \u2014 the north-easterly flow is regarded as \" due to the vis a fronts originating in the action of the cold upon the water of the polar area, whereby its level is always tending to depression.\" Dr. Carpenter, in the course of his investigations of this subject, and as the result of his deep-sea dredgings, brought out many facts of a very inter- * \" On the Gibraltar Current, the Gulf Stream, and the General Oceanic Circulation.\" By Dr. W.

His chemical and thermal analyses of the waters of the Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic developed some remarkable facts. One of these is the satis factory determination of the supposed cause of the vertical currents \u2014 accounting for an inflowing of the surface-water through the Straits of Gibraltar and an outflowing under-current of equal strength and velocity \u2014 which is always found there. Dr. Carpenter attributes this to the greater evaporation which takes place in the Mediterranean Sea over that in the Atlantic outside the Straits of Gibraltar, and shows it to be susceptible of experimental elucidation. Mr. Bent has very intelligently explained and discussed this and one or two incidental questions pertinent to our subject as follows : \" Let us suppose that the waters in the Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic were of a uniform depth of 1000 feet, and were at rest. Evaporation now begins, and a layer of 10 feet is taken off the surface of the Mediterranean. This destroys the equilibrium of volume or quantity, and a surface current begins at once to flow from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean to restore that equilibrium."], [185, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 135 When this is done and the depth of the water in the Mediterranean again becomes 1000 feet, the equilibrium of weight is destroyed by the addi tional salt that is carried in by the new layer of 10 feet of water and placed on top of that con tained in the original 1000 feet, all of which was left behind when the evaporation of water took place ; this greater weight pressing laterally against the lighter waters of the Atlantic, flows out, as an under-current, to restore this disturbed equilibrium of weight. \" Dr. Carpenter's opinion is, that the same phe nomenon is produced in the circulation of the oceans by the disturbance of equilibrium from the expansion by heat of the waters in the tropics, and the contraction by cold of those in the Polar and northern regions, and the currents thus produced would continue to flow to and from the equator and the Poles whether the equatorial or tropical belt was free from obstructions or not ; and furthermore, that the warm waters which contribute heat for the amelioration of the climates of Europe and the British Islands \u2022 come \u2014 in conformity with this law of circulation just explained \u2014 directly north from the tropics, along the west coast of Africa and Spain, on their way to the Polar regions."], [186, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 136 \" Now, I entirely agree with Dr. Carpenter, that these influences form the basis of the oceanic and inter-oceanic circulation, and that, if the earth was at rest, this circulation would be uniformly vertical, and as uniformly due north and south in all parts of the world. But Dr. Carpenter seems to forget that there are other great forces caused b)r the re volving of the earth upon its axis, which, if not of primary importance in the production of currents, are at least very potential in changing the direc tion of this circulation, in showing why the currents incline obliquely to the east when flowing from equatorial regions to the north or south, and ob liquely to the west when flowing from the Polar regions towards the equator. \" Were it not for this obliquity of flow, the cold currents which, according to Dr. Carpenter's theory, must always be imcfe r-currents, would never appear at the surface of the sea ; but this, we know, is not the case, as every one who crosses the western limits of the Gulf Stream and Kuro Siwo sees on passing through the heavy * tide-rips ' that mark the chafing where they rub swiftly against the cold currents from the north that intervene between them and the continents to the west. There is another force, or law of mechanics, which has been well estab-"], [187, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 137 lished and long known, with which Dr. Carpenter's position very strangely conflicts. \"This law was demonstrated by Mr. William Ferrell, of Cambridge, in 1860, and is regarded as an extension of Hadley's explanation of the trade winds. Ferrell's demonstration is in the following form, viz. : ' In whatever direction a body moves on the surface of the earth, there is a force arising from the earth's rotation which deflects it to the right in the northern hemisphere, but to the left in the southern.' * \" It follows from this law, that in the northern hemisphere every river current tends or presses more towards the right bank than towards the left, no matter which way its course may lie, whether east and west, like the Ohio, or north and south, like the Mississippi, or in any other direction. So, too, a railroad train must always bear more heavily on the right rail of the track along which it is flying. \" Without stopping to discuss this law of terres trial mechanics, it may be enough to point out that it must be, in some degree, potential in giving direction to the trade-winds and ocean currents. * See Ferrell's Motion of Fluids and Solids Relative to the Earth's Surface, p. 25."], [188, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 138 It may be counteracted, and is sometimes counter acted by greater forces, but always makes itself felt in the resultant motion. Dr. Carpenter and his co-theorists \u2014 of whom, however, there are but few even in England\u2014 bring the Gulf Stream to New foundland and there leave it. They forget that, if no other forces were at work to carry it to the north and east, this very law of the earth's rota tion would carry it onward towards the British Islands.\"* In thus presenting the views of Dr. Carpenter, we have afforded the reader an insight into those of another writer upon these questions, who, if less a man of science, is perhaps not less a practical observer in the domain of which he treats than the eminent physicist we have referred to. But in passing we may note that Captain Bent, in discuss ing the subject of heat derived from the Gulf Stream, and its ameliorating influence upon the climate of Great Britain, and indeed Europe, has raised a question that may well create alarm in British geographical and scientific circles, perhaps even greater than should the theory of Dr. Peter mann, which cuts the English Expedition off from * Thermal Paths to the Pole.

Nor has he dis played so different a system of reasoning, though he leaves the startling result to be brought about by the quiet and gradual, but possibly surer, pro cesses of nature and time. In the extract we may give to illustrate this, one gets again Sir Charles Ly ell's opinion regarding the origin of the Gulf Stream, wherein he, too, appears to disagree with Dr. Carpenter. He says : \" For instance, the waters in the Gulf of Mexico which are driven westward and piled up by the continued influence of the east wind, are now deflected back by the Isthmus of Panama. But it is obvious that if this isthmus had no existence, these waters would flow on westward into the Pacific Ocean, instead of giving origin to the Gulf Stream.

While he considers that modern investigations and examinations, important as they have been, have not even yet entirely relieved it of mystery, still he thinks they \" encourage the opinion that this stream, as well as all the constant currents of the sea, is due mainly to the constant difference produced by temperature and saltness in the specific gravity of water in certain parts of the ocean.

He says : \" The sun, heat, and cold are the principal sources of motion. The only thing we have to do is to observe the motions of the sea and air, their temperatures and densities ; and these facts, when grouped together in sufficient numbers and \" (he is now using the words of Maury) \"catechised with reverence by a mind unbiassed by theories and speculations, will themselves reveal the cause or place in our hands the clue to such explanation as man is permitted to comprehend.\" It is true, Lieutenant Maury admits that the agents already mentioned as the foundation of his hypothesis \" are not the sole cause of the currents,\" and it may be well to quote him a little further. * Maury, quoted by Commodore Jansen.

But when the winds and the rains cease, and the barometer is stationary, the currents that were the consequence cease. The currents thus created are therefore ephemeral. But the changes of temperature and of saltness, and the work of other agents which affect the specific gravity of sea-water and derange its equilibrium, are as ceaseless in their operations as the sun in his course, and in their effects they are as endless. Philosophy points to them as the chief cause of the Gulf Stream and of all the constant currents of the sea. Mr. Croll has observed that Maury 's conclusion seems to resolve itself into this \u2014 that the waters in inter-tropical regions are expanded by the heat, and those in the Polar regions are contracted by the cold, and that this tends to produce a surface current from the equator to the poles, and an * Maury, op. cit."], [194, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 144 under - current from the poles to the equator. Maury and Dr. Carpenter, therefore, do not, in certain respects, materially differ, though the former, Lieutenant Maury, yields to no one in respect to the great importance and influence he attaches to the Gulf Stream. There is no one, however, who has written more interestingly upon this subject than Professor T. B. Maury, and with him we may conclude. Magnificent as are the proportions of the Gulf Stream, it is but a small part of the mighty flow of waters which move as steadily as the stars in their courses, in the Torrid Zone, round the world. The cause of this flow \u2014 involving a theory already touched upon \u2014 is thus in part explained by this writer : \" By the earth's rotation on its axis, objects on its surface, between the tropics, are carried from west to east at a rate of 1000 miles an hour, whilst, as we advance towards the poles, this rate decreases with the decrease in the circum ference of the parallels of latitude, so that when we arrive at points where the circumference is only 12,000 miles, instead of 24,000, as it is at the equator, this velocity of rotation is but 500 miles an hour, and so on decreasing until reaching the pole."], [195, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 145 \"Now, an object set in motion toward the equator from the polar regions, where the velocity of rotation is small, will constantly be arriving at points on the earth's surface where the velocity is greater, and not at once acquiring this greater velocity, its direction will tend obliquely to the westward. Hence we find those streams or currents which flow from the pole toward the equator always taking a south-westwardly direc tion whenever the continents and islands will permit. \" These streams from the northern and southern hemispheres meeting at the equator, form and give direction to the equatorial currents, the waters of which are thrown to the westward ; but interrupted by the continents which lie across their paths, and changed in their specific gravity by the expansive heat of the sun, they throw off hot streams to the north and south, like blood from the heart in the animal system, to carry their life-giving warmth and nourishment along their paths to the earth's extremities.\" And in allusion to the thermometric theory, Professor Maury says : \u2014 \"If it be true that the Gulf Stream reaches the Pole with heat enough to melt its ices, it ought to vol. 1. k"], [196, "146 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. follow, conversely, that the cold, counter under-cur rent from the Arctic Ocean, that offsets the Gulf Stream, will, in its long flow to the South, lose but little of its Arctic cold, and reach the tropics with frigerific power. Such, at least, would be the demand of a remorseless logic. Anxiously we turn to ask, * Is this demand satisfied ? Do the nicest mean observations attest the fact indubitably ? ' Here is a gigantic balance, hung by the Creator Himself, one scale at the Pole, the other at the tropic. The first is, as yet, invisible ; the other we can read. We know that they must be in equilibrio. Let us go to the tropic, and with the deep-sea ther mometer drag up an answer from this unbiassed and incorruptible witness. \" We have the most exact observations, taken with a variety of exquisitely-constructed instru ments, and continued, at a vast expense of money and care, through many years. They all tell the same story, so that Science may be said to have sat at the feet of this great aqueous traveller to the Pole and heard him recount its mysteries. Pro fessor Bache, of the United States Coast Survey, records that ' at the very bottom of the Gulf Stream, when its waters at the surface were 80\u00b0 in tempe rature, the instruments of the Coast Survey recorded"], [197, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 147 a temperature as low as 35\u00b0 Fahrenheit'!* The cushion of water under this must have been even colder; and this cushion is the counter under current whose testimony we are seeking.\" \" There is no room for surprise,\" he continues, \" when we are told that the Gulf Stream enters the space round the Pole at a temperature above the freezing-point (28\u00b0), when we find warmer water (at 36\u00b0) almost at the Pole, and outside the heat bearing current. \" The Arctic current that offsets the Gulf Stream and flows south, reaching it at 35\u00b0 temperature, could not have left the Pole colder than 28\u00b0; for then it would have been frozen up. In its transit to the south it only loses 6\u00b0 or 7\u00b0 of its temperature. * This would seem to conflict with the testimony of Professor C. Wyville Thomson, who, as we have seen, declares the Gulf Stream to be of practically equal temperature throughout its entire depth. The quotation really comes, however, from Lieutenant Maury, who further observes : \" These cold waters doubtless come down from the north to replace the warm water sent through the Gulf Stream to moderate the cold of Spitzbergen ; for within the Arctic Circle the temperature at corresponding depths off the shores of that island is said to be only 1\u00b0 colder than the Caribbean Sea, while on the shores of Labrador and in the Polar seas the temperature of the water beneath the ice was invariably found by Lieutenant De Haven at 28\u00b0, or 4\u00b0 below the melting-point of fresh-water ice. Captain Scoresby relates that on the coast of Greenland, in latitude 72\u00b0, the temperature of the air was 42\u00b0 ; of the water 34\u00b0 ; and 29\u00b0 at the depth of 118 fathoms.\" \u2014 The Physical Geography of the Sea, and its Meteorology, pp. 58, 59."], [198, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 148 Is it, then, a thing incredible, that the Gulf Stream, this mighty * river in the ocean,' whose caloric, ' if utilised, could keep in blast a Cyclopean furnace, capable of sending forth a stream of molten iron as large as the volume discharged by the Mississippi river ' \u2014 is it incredible that this current may reach the Polar region at 36\u00b0 ? Remember it begins its race off Florida at 86\u00b0. It might then lose 50\u00b0 of its heat (against the loss of 6\u00b0 or 7\u00b0 of its coun ter-current), flow on to the Pole, melt its ices, and yet have 8\u00b0 of heat to spare before it would fall to 28\u00b0, the ice-point. The estimate of its rate of ther mal reduction, as given by the United States Hydro graphical Bureau, is that, so far as traced, ' it loses 2\u00b0 of heat in running over 10\u00b0 of latitude ;' i.e., it suffers a loss of 1\u00b0 in every 300 miles. A simple calculation shows that it ought to reach the Pole at this rate, certainly not below 48\u00b0 or 50\u00b0 (more probably\" 60\u00b0).\"* The majority of opinions upon this subject, there fore, appear to point definitely to the conclusion that the Gulf Stream by no means exhausts its force or its heat on its approach to the Arctic barrier, up to which point it has been distinctly traced ; but * \" Gateways to the Pole.\" Putnam's Monthly Magazine, New Series, vol. iv. pp. 527, 528."], [199, "THE ARCTIC BARRIER AND GULF STREAM. 149 rather that it flows on to the very Pole, effecting there, too, not the less Avonderful results because they are as yet veiled in mystery. What we have shown, moreover, only adds force to the observa tion of Caj-tain Osborn respecting the importance of a distinctive examination of the Gulf Stream upon its own merits ; but it also strongly sustains the idea earlier advanced, that it would more than likely facilitate, if really followed, the approach to the North Pole of an Arctic expedition. However, the object we have in view is the revival of Dutch Arctic enterprise, and the pursuit of such enterprise by whatever route and by what ever mode may best appeal to the judgment of enlightened and scientific men : the primal motive from this point of view being not merely to reach the North Pole, but to discover and bring to light the hidden mysteries of that unknown region of the globe. Lest, therefore, the route we have set forth should not avail for this purpose \u2014 or, indeed, should not promise such encouragement as even to induce Netherlanders to investigate it on the ground itself, in the event of their taking up this subject\u2014 let us turn our attention for a brief space to another way, by which it can hardly be pos-"], [200, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 150 sible that the Pole may not be reached by men determined to win so grand a prize : namely, via Spitzbergen ; to be attempted by means of ships, or ships and \"sledge-boats.\""], [201, "( i5i . CHAPTER X. THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. Let us once more clearly define the primal route we have proposed, and its alternative. 1st, The Gulf Stream route, which is supposed to offer a comparatively uninterrupted ship-channel by following the course of the Gulf Stream (not hitherto traced) deflected northwards from Norway and Novaya Zemlya. 2nd, Alternative route via Spitzbergen, being that way to the North Pole which would make Spitz bergen the base of operations. The \" Gulf Stream\" route has had our first claims, because it seems desirable, upon every account, that the exploration of the North Polar area should be made, if possible, by means of ships, or with ships at a convenient distance. It is therefore clear that, if anything like an unobstructed ship-channel is to be found to the Northern"], [202, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 152 point of radiation by following any existing upward current, such channel should be sought out and pursued. A direct line from Spitzbergen, however, we cannot think would be found to offer such a channel. Nevertheless, as forming the nearest and most convenient known base of opera tions, this may, we think, with propriety be pro posed as an alternative to the first. In case of adopting the Spitzbergen route, how ever, it would be necessary to bring to bear a com bined plan of attack upon the foe which has so long held men at bay. The ship, the sledge, and an appropriately designed sledge-boat, would be almost equally necessary ; whilst to note carefully, from the Spitzbergen outlook, the best season for advanc ing Polewards, would be equally indispensable. Dr. Petermann has, it is true, expressed the belief \u2014 and, indeed, some other eminent authorities also \u2014 that a strong steam vessel would be able to make its way through the pack, at the most favourable season of the year, at almost any point ; he further believes that by this means, and with the experience gained by the more recent expeditions, \" the central area will be penetrated as far north as the Pole.\" * * Letter addressed to the President of the Royal Geographical Society, by Dr. Augustus Petermann, Nature, vol. xi. (1874) p. 37."], [203, "THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. 153 In the absence of any known change of views, moreover, on his part, it may be of interest to quote a most hopeful opinion expressed by that geographer ten years ago (in a letter supplementary to the one already referred to, urging the despatch of an English expedition by Spitzbergen) as to the proper plan to be pursued by this route. He says : \u2014 \"A new expedition to the North Pole by way of Spitzbergen might leave port about the 1st of March, before the drifting masses of ice from the Siberian shores encumber the Spitzbergen seas ; it would then have a chance to sail, under favourable circumstances, in one stretch to the North Pole, perhaps in three or four weeks, and arrive there at the beginning of the Polar dawn and summer. Within the six summer months the whole western \u2014 the American- \u2014 boundary of the Arctic basin, from the northernmost known point of East Green land to Behring Strait, might be reconnoitred, the Asiatic boundary being already tolerably well known by Russian research. In September or October one of the vessels might be sent home with tidings of the season's proceedings, the other remaining for the winter as near as possible to the Pole, in order to make scientific observations, by which the key-"], [204, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 154 stone would be added to our whole meteorological system of the Northern Hemisphere ; the second vessel returning in the spring. In the harbour of Spitzbergen (sic), in latitude 80\u00b0, the expedition would have a fixed base for constant communica tion with England, attainable all the year round from the Thames by a fortnight's sail.\" * For England read Holland, and for the Thames the Y, and Spitzbergen is then placed only nearer and more approachable as a base for convenient communication with home, should a Dutch expedi tion be despatched by this route. Moreover, could such success be met with in the North as attended Sir James Ross in the Antarctic regions \u2014 who with singular good fortune pushed through 800 miles of pack-ice and came to open water \u2014 there would in deed be hope of our realising this picture. But the lessons of experience are opposed to the probability of so successful a penetration of the North Polar area from this point as Dr. Petermann would encourage us to look for ; and it may, perhaps, be fairly questioned whether, in the light alone of the experience afforded by the two German expeditions, the learned writer himself would not now regard such ease of procedure in the matter of Arctic re- * Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. ix. p. 110."], [205, "THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. 155 search in extreme latitudes as partaking too much of the couleur de rose. The deductions of enlightened theory, based upon such glimpses as we have been able to obtain of the mysterious North Polar realm, are interesting and even profitable, and speculative views will con tinue to be entertained regarding the best means of approach to it, until ascertained facts, as the result of well-directed enterprise, shall displace the theo retical in the minds of men. After all, any approach to mere speculation, when advocating expeditions and the staking of human lives, is to be avoided. To send men into the Arctic seas with the idea that ice and snows and north winds are not to be emphatically the rule, and that dangers, privations, and hardships are to be but remote contingencies, would be opposed to the judgment of the most plausible arguer for the Spitzbergen route, or the route by Smith Sound. The experience of Arctic navigators must be our guide, and this, if it were not indeed our only data, has cost too much to be ignored. What, then, does experience teach with reference to the Spitzbergen region. The answer we are obliged to give is, that three centuries of severe battling on the part of heroic seamen at this point"], [206, "156 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. has not furnished us with one authentic instance in which the Polar pack has been successfully pene trated. Up to the line which Spitzbergen marks and to the western and northern shores of that island, Captain Osborn has himself truly said that \" yachtsmen go for pleasure and poor Norwegian fishermen sail in almost open boats ; \" but to sail far beyond it becomes quite another matter, and a feat hitherto attended with great if not insur mountable difficulties. Passing over the older voyagers, we need hardly do more than mention the names of Phipps, Buchan, Franklin, Scoresby, Clavering, Liitke, Parry, Nor denskiold, Koldewey, Leigh Smith, Lamont, as those who have attempted to reach the Pole by Spitzbergen, or who have made examinations of the ice in that neighbourhood, to confirm the truth of what we state. Yet what was their experience? In 1773, Phipps, with the North Pole for his distinctive aim, cruised all the summer, and as late as the 20th of August, north of Spitzbergen, without being able to reach the 81st degree of latitude. In 1818, Buchan and Franklin, encouraged by the reports of the whalers of a comparatively open sea, repeated the attempt, but without reaching higher than"], [207, "THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. 157 80\u00b0 34', being opposed by the same inevitable bar rier which had stopped all other expeditions from the time of Hudson, and returning convinced that the Spitzbergen meridians afforded little hope of extreme northward advance with ships. Scoresby, who for so many years, and with such intelligent aim and forethought, cruised in the waters between Spitzbergen and Greenland, suc ceeded only once in attaining 81\u00b0 30', though he found at one time a stretch of water extending 300 miles, and observes, \" Had it been my object, I might have penetrated to a considerable degree towards the north, but prudence dictated my re turn.\" Scoresby, however, as is well known, was a whaleman, and was not attempting to reach the Pole. Similar to these was the experience of Captain Clavering, in the \"Griper,\" in 1823, sent out in company of Captain Sabine on a scientific errand to Spitzbergen. While the important pendulum observations of Sabine were being made, Claver ing examined the pack edge directly north from Cloven Cliff, with no opening perceivable as far as the eye could reach, in latitude 80\u00b0 20' N. The history of Parry's gallant effort north from Spitzbergen, in sledge-boats, is well known ; and"], [208, "158 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTh. the latitude of 82\u00b0 45' N., which he attained, re mains to this day a feat unparalleled in the annals of authentic Arctic voyages. His attempt, however, from its peculiar bearing on our subject, will demand more special mention farther on. The experience of Ltitke, like that of the Austrian explorers previously described, belongs to a some what different locality \u2014 to the Barents Sea and the Novaya Zemlya region. He failed to reach so high a latitude, by several degrees, as even Phipps, or as high as Leigh Smith, Nordenskiold, and Lamont attained. And could we but ascertain the experi ence of the numberless Dutch and English whalers which, during a long period, frequented this region, we should not probably have anything very dif ferent to record ; for, as touching the former, Com modore Jansen does not find that any of the Dutch whalers got beyond about 80\u00b0 N. Thus, 81\u00b0 42', recorded by the Swedish expedition of 1868, and 81\u00b0 30' by Leigh Smith, are substan tially the same as Scoresby reached, and higher than even Dutch whalers themselves claimed at this point. The mean of these latitudes may there fore be put down as almost the extreme limit to which free sailing can be looked for north of Spitz bergen, and this parallel has only been attained"], [209, "THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. 159 by approaching from the westward of that island. Any advance northward beyond about 81\u00b0 30' must be achieved by determined persistence, either with strong steamers, watching their opportunity, or by resorting to sledge and boat travelling. Yet much depends upon the openness of the sea son ; and for the moment, taking opinions and not experience for our guide, there is reason to believe that in a very exceptional season a ship might push two or three degrees higher without encountering much difficulty. Parry states that before the middle of August 1827, a ship might have sailed to 82\u00b0 \"almost without touching a piece of ice ; \" and it was the opinion among the officers of the expedition that \"by the end of that month it would pro bably have been no very difficult matter to reach the parallel of 83\u00b0, about the meridian of the Seven Islands.\" * Phipps, on the other hand, found his ship being closely beset, in 1773, in latitude 80\u00b0 48' N., on the 6th of August.

We cannot forbear remarking here, even at the expense of a possible digression, that some who apparently have faith in the ability of ships to penetrate to the Pole, and who substantially en dorse the Spitzbergen route, look upon the Novaya Zemlya base as yielding the greater hope of a suc cessful northward advance. Of these, that practical seaman and Arctic navi gator, Captain Allen Young, would seem to be one \u2014 that is, assuming him not to have changed his opinion since the days of active route discussion, as some have evidently done. He then expressed the conviction \" that when the ice travelled south wards the surface of the sea ceased to freeze in the months of July and August ; that there must be a space of open water found in the rear of the ice which had come south ; and that if a screw-steamer could be taken up to the edge of the ice between Novaya Zemlya and Spitzbergen, between the meri dian of 40\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 E., in the middle of July, she would, by cruising along the edge, find an oppor tunity of forcing her way into the pack. Should"], [211, "THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. 161 she succeed in getting five or six miles inside the pack, she would be in comparatively smooth water, and could then push on to the north, working through the ice as it moved south, until, having passed through two or three hundred miles of the pack, she would then arrive at open water in the rear of the pack, and would sail away to the Pole, returning by the same route, or by any other meri dian as might be found advisable.\" * It was at about the same point in the Barents Sea indicated by Captain Allen Young as a pre- ferable one to start from, that Mr. Lamont of Knockdow, on the 19th of June, 1869, recorded in the journal of his first \"Diana\" cruise that some- what remarkable prognostication, of which he tells us in his new work, respecting the possibility of finding \"large lands\" northward, where Franz Josef Land has since been discovered. Just before this he says, \" I should very much like, with fine weather and plenty of coals, to try and get into a high latitude somewhere about here (75\u00b0 11' N, 48\u00b0 32' K), either directly or by sailing to Cape Nassau in Novaya Zemlya and trying to get north west. \" t * Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. xii. p. 154. t Yachting in the Arctic Seas, p. 205.

But to return to Spitzbergen. It has seemed due alike to our subject and to the reader that we should present, in the first place, the less promising aspects of this route ; and there can be no doubt that the sum of experience gained by explorers at this point is opposed to the probability of the Pole being reached by ships on the Spitzbergen meridian. Yet this does not necessarily furnish a conclusive reason why, in a peculiarly enterprising and daring age, the attempt should not be made. Nor is it by any means certain that the navigator who shall unite boldness with prudence, and perseverance with determination, may not, with all our improved facilities for ice navigation, succeed in such an undertaking. Spitzbergen, upon many accounts, offers a supe rior base whence to prosecute Arctic research. It is"], [214, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 164 of importance to remember that it is within cer tain and easy reach every summer from the Dutch ports ; affording secure harbourage on its northern most coast, and being itself a far advance pole wards ; while natural influences combine to render the region more tolerable to existence, even in winter, than Novaya Zemlya, several degrees farther south \u2014 facts, altogether, which make it at once the most convenient and desirable point within the whole range of the Arctic Circle from which any European expedition might push inves tigations. Then again, the fact that the islands abound in deer and other game, and in wild-fowl, is a desideratum, as supplying a possible need ; and the promise also of the recoupment of a large share of the expenses from the profits of the fisheries, in the case of ships remaining long here, is a matter not to be lightly regarded. And upon this point Mr. Lamont's testimony is very apropos, where he says, truly enough, that \" the fact of a small vessel like the ' Diana ' being able largely to recoup her heavy expenses has an important bearing on Arctic exploration.\"* To encourage the Arctic explorer by Spitzbergen, * Yachting in the Arctic Seas, p. 90."], [215, "THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. 165 moreover, there may now be brought to bear a com paratively new element in ice-navigation \u2014 viz., the screw-steamer, which has hitherto had no really effective trial by any route from which we have had time to get results. With the exception of the essays of Leigh Smith and Nordenskiold, and perhaps of Koldewey \u2014 which were rather exami nations of the ice than serious attempts to steam to the Pole \u2014 all expeditions whose ships have sought to push through the ice-barrier north of Spitzbergen belong to an era in Arctic navigation anterior to the days of steam vessels. This may, therefore, reasonably afford hope ; and probably the confident belief of Dr. Petermann which we have quoted, that the Pole will yet be reached by ships, was founded no less upon the fact of the admirable adaptability of steam-power in diffi cult navigation than upon the theories of an open Polar sea and the continuation of the Gulf Stream. No ship, however, can be expected to make its way through the ice-pack so long as the latter remains unseparated and continuous. Perhaps, therefore, a greater encouragement than any other is to be found in the ever-changing, drifting character of the ice (though this possesses also its dangers). All Arctic navigators bear witness to this fact,"], [216, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 166 but it is especially illustrated by the experience of Sir James Ross in his Antarctic cruise. He found that the pack-ice changed its place very rapidly, and \u2014 although he was without the grand modern essential we have spoken of \u2014 was enabled to pur sue his voyage without very great difficulty. For example, when in February, 1842, he encountered a tremendous pack of 500 miles in extent, he found, only four weeks later, the sea entirely open and almost free of ice ; and this might prove to be the case sometimes in the hitherto blockaded seas be tween Spitzbergen and the North Pole, especially if a ship were to remain for a period on the ground and watch her opportunity. In this latter point a good deal is involved. It is impossible, either after a thorough investigation of this subject, or, we imagine, any lengthened practical Arctic experience, not to recognise the great difference there is between \" open \" and \" close \" seasons in the Arctic seas ; so that the suc cess of Arctic voyages, almost more than any other enterprises, must depend not a little upon good fortune.

That there is a probability of this we may judge from the opinion expressed by the com mander of the \" Hecla,\" in 1827, already cited ; but more especially if, coupled with that, Dr. Petermann be correct in stating that Parry saw a \" navigable sea \" before him when about to turn from his Sisyphus -like labour on that memorable 23d day of July, 1827. Some observations gleaned from an article of Mr. R. A. Proctor's, contributed not so very long ago to an important scientific journal, seem worthy of notice at this point as favourable to the Spitz bergen route, and also to the chance of reaching the Pole with ships (\" by the path which Parry followed \") ; and it is noticeable that this man of science finds some encouragement for the Spitz bergen route itself in the presence of the Gulf Stream in these high latitudes \u2014 of which he traces one branch up to the west of Spitzbergen, \" the main stream making its way,\" he says, \" towards Nova Zembla.\" Mr. Proctor avails himself of the arguments of Herr W. von Freeden in Petermann's \" Mittheil uno-en,\" and asks if Nature herself does not point"], [218, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 168 out this track past Spitzbergen as the proper course for North Polar explorers. Here, we are told, in the first place, the mildest temperature is to be found ; here also is an assisting current \u2014 valeat quantum valere debet (adds Mr. Proctor). But the chief circumstance to which attention is drawn is, that the course followed by the Gulf Stream shows that there is open water \u2014 \" ice - encumbered, no doubt, but still not ice-bound \" \u2014 in this direction. Another interesting fact noticed is, the great depth of the sea in this part of the Atlantic. Scoresby long ago endeavoured in vain to find a bottom here with a two-mile line ; and Von Freeden quaintly remarks that the whole of the Bernese Oberland might be hidden, \"its presence unbe trayed even by an eddy,\" under the ocean to the north of Spitzbergen. \" Here, then, if anywhere,\" adds Mr. Proctor, \" a ship might expect to find her way through, though experience has shown again and again that the way is full of dangers.\" Again, pointing to Parry's experience during his boat-and-sledge expedition, when carried back by the movement of the ice over which he travelled, and to the lessons taught by his defeat, Mr. Proctor says : \" The very fact that Parry's great ice-ship floated freely shows how wide and deep the sea must"], [219, "THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. 169 be even far to the north of the spot reached. For not only could he see no sign of water in front \u2014 and the Arctic voyager can recognise a ' water-sky ' at a great distance \u2014 but the point where he turned must have been a few days before some hundred miles at least further north, for he and his party had been floated back more than a hundred miles. There must then have been, that year at least, a course round the floating ice-fields which would have carried a daring seaman between the North Pole and Parry's farthest point, and far to the north of the latter point \" \u2014 a practical recognition, it may be observed, of Sir John Barrow's truism, \" Where ice can float, a, vessel can float also.\" \" On the other hand,\" concludes Mr. Proctor, \" the ease with which Parry's party pushed their way north wards shows, as Herr von Freeden justly remarks, that it would be no very difficult matter to attain the Pole itself over the ice if the journey were made in early summer.\" * This brings us naturally to the famous poleward attempt of Sir Edward Parry in this direction as the final argument in favour of the Spitzbergen route, and, taken with all its lessons, perhaps the * \" The German and Swedish Expeditions to the Arctic Regions,\" Nature, vol. i. pp. 312, 313."], [220, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 170 most hopeful one. Certainly no single failure of the kind has been more frequently made use of by writers to point out that which they deemed the way to success. It has long been considered, at least until very lately, that Parry, although he came short of realis ing the grand object of his expedition, was success ful in demonstrating, almost beyond a doubt, the possibility of a future expedition, organised upon the same model, but profiting by his mistakes, being able to reach the North Pole. The plan surely had novelty to recommend it ; and, as an enterprise, the voyage was undoubtedly the boldest ever volun tarily undertaken on the broad ocean, whether ice bound or otherwise. The idea, however, it is right to say, was more Scoresby's than Parry's. The lengthened observa tions of that veteran whaler in the Greenland seas, and his constant reflection on the subject of the best way of reaching the Pole, led him, after the failure of the ship expedition of Buchan and Franklin, to advise an expedition to proceed from Spitzbergen by open boats, so fixed on runners as to be easily dragged over the ice, and yet be ready to sail through any passages of open water. The experience of Parry and Franklin (the latter"], [221, "THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. 171 having, indeed, himself offered to conduct the ex pedition) led them to thoroughly approve of the plan, which also had the support of Sir Humphrey Davy, the President of the Royal Society ; and when such men deemed it feasible, it was not likely to want for attentive consideration from the public, nor to fail at length to secure the favour of the Admiralty. Parry, fresh from his recent retracing of the steps of Bylot, Baffin, Fox, and Middleton, was placed in command of the new expedition, and proceeded, in April, 1827, in the famous discovery-ship \"Hecla,\" for Spitzbergen. Even this was not early in the season for the kind of journey contemplated for the expedition ; but detention north of Spitzbergen, the looking out of a safe anchorage for the ship, &c, caused the summer to be well advanced before the real work was commenced, and it was June 23d before the now historic boats \" Discovery\" and \" Enterprise \" were manned, and started on their difficult journey (for we must here differ from Mr. Proctor). But not to be betrayed into narrating the details of this Herculean poleward struggle. We know too well that Parry and his party did not reach their intended goal. They were baffled ; but not until"], [222, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 172 they had attained a latitude which gave to the Spitzbergen route, and still associates with it, the highest point ever reached by civilised men, so far as we have authentic knowledge. In getting no nearer than 435 miles from the Pole \u2014 or 172 from the ship \u2014 they calculated that they travelled, during their sixty-one days' absence, fully four fifths of the necessary distance in miles to have made the journey to the Pole and back in a direct line ; and, in spite of other discouraging circum stances, they were only compelled to give up the attempt because the ice was being swept faster to the south than they could drag the boats to the north. Subsequent experience has shown that this result was only natural in the case of an attempt made thus in the height of the Arctic summer, when all the ice-fields were in motion ; though some now believe that it would not have been essentially different had Parry set out from Spitzbergen even in the early spring, basing their opinion mainly on the experience of Professor Nordenskiold north of Spitzbergen in the beginning of April, 1873, after the wintering in Mossel Bay. But although Nor denskiold \"repeated Parry's failure,\" it is evident that he did not repeat that navigator's gallant endeavour, for he went no farther than the Seven"], [223, "THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. 173 Islands before deciding that the nature of the ice offered no inducement to a serious effort. Nor do we understand that his expedition was organised at all with the view of reaching the North Pole in this way. We, however, find Captain Osborn himself, and Mr. Markham with him, declaring that Parry, in stead of starting on such a journey in June, ought to have wintered in Spitzbergen, and started for the north in February ; and that (Parry's experience having clearly shown that the food-allowance was insufficient, and the weight the men were compelled to drag too heavy), in view of the perfection to which sledge equipment is now brought, \" the weights would be infinitely less for the men to drag, whilst the provisions would last months in stead of weeks.\" But the several errors committed in carrying out this plan of an expedition were such as only experience could be expected to remedy.

England has never been induced to repeat the heroic experiment in the Greenland seas which stands to the credit of the noble Parry. It remains not only the last, but the most remarkable of her Spitz bergen .attempts ; and perhaps the numerous re pulses she has met with in this direction may fairly justify her in turning as she has done to a route which until now she has left practically untried. But in the case of Holland the aro-uments are O fairly reversed. England would seem to be out of her latitude in the Spitzbergen region, while it belongs to Holland by right of prior occupancy, and indeed of discovery. And yet the Dutch have completely abandoned it for the past two centuries, and left to other nationalities the sole continuance of a work manifestly belonging to themselves to prosecute ; they have indeed ceased"], [226, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 176 from all researches in the high latitudes, and have yet to make their first real poleward attempt. There are certainly valid reasons for urging upon Holland the revival of Northern exploration. Other countries would rejoice to see an Arctic expedition launched by the one country, we might almost say, that in early times sent out from her busy ports \u2014 some now acquiring an unenviable fame as \"dead cities\" \u2014 her enterprising voyagers, discovering, colonising, and conquering in all parts of the globe. An expedition via Spitzbergen would be a very inexpensive undertaking, at least when compared with the English expedition, equipped for a three years' absence, by a route which makes the Pole nearly twice the distance from the home base that it would be for Holland by the Spitzbergen route. Sir Edward Parry's expedition was gone but six months from England and cost only \u00a39900, and the voyage of the \"Fox,\" which brought back the sad but priceless trophies which told the fate of Franklin, cost England only \u00a38400. In striking contrast with these amounts is the sum required for fitting out the present expedition by Smith Sound, which has already cost, we may say, the \u00a395,000 originally appropriated, besides a probable expense of \u00a320,000"], [227, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 177 to \u00a330,000 per annum whilst absent. Added to this will be the expense of keeping up annual com munication with the \" Discovery \" (which it is grati fying to see is not to be overlooked), and possible relief expeditions. England has undertaken to go to the North Pole, and she will do it ; but it is impossible to deny that she has chosen the most expensive route conceivable for this enterprise. England, however, is a great nation, and would not think of doing things by halves. But, then, a small people may prove itself a great nation. This, indeed, Holland has done more than once. It might surprise the outside world \u2014 so ignorant of what Holland really is \u2014 to see how easily she could supply a couple of Arctic ships, or even men-of war, if the latter were demanded, at the present time from her really extensive fleet ; with what ease, too, she could equip and send forth an Arctic ex pedition, and sustain it even for a series of years in the Spitzbergen seas, and still carry on her \" little war \" on the other side of the globe. The Nether lands of to-day, in point of naval strength, is fully worthy of the Netherlands of the days of Tronip and De Ruyter, though this fact may be little realised by the world at large. And this is just the reason why the Dutch VOL. I. M"], [228, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 178 should despatch an Arctic expedition \u2014 in order to call the attention of other nations to that little country which has but recently been pointed out as affording \" a true terra incognita in the centre of Europe.\" It would, we say, do more to make Holland known abroad than any one thing she could do ; but it is quite certain that the Dutch are not possessed of such national vanity as to act from a motive of this kind, albeit armed cap-a-pie with true national pride. We have early pointed sufficiently to the great internal enterprises of Holland; and such signs of progress must effectually do away with the byword which has in times past been flung at the Dutch as being the \"Chinese of Europe.\" Nor do we re quire here to point out the inappropriateness of the derisive language sometimes indulged in by foreigners Avhen alluding to this worthy people ; still, perhaps, we should intimate that those who do thus indulge only exhibit, in the estimation of the Dutch, an ignorance so profound as to com pletely turn the tables upon themselves. Happily, though, the writers are few who have not some idea of Holland's glorious role in history, and upon this foundation alone she might generally, and with perfect safety, base her claims to respect."], [229, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 179 But determined enterprise in the direction of Arctic research would remove effectually all such taunts as the above, just as it has given to the little Scandinavian nations, particularly to Sweden, the reputation of being foremost in promoting the advancement\" of scientific investigations. And who would hear of Sweden and Norway, we had almost said, if it were not for their Arctic enter prises ? Researches in the direction of Spitzbergen do not absolutely require Government sustentation : private enterprise might do very much here. By no means would we be understood as opposing private enterprise in this matter. There is nothing to prevent a private expedition from being as thorough and efficient as one organised under the auspices of a Government. But this is hardly likely to be the case ; and in Arctic exploration, in view especially of the object now aimed at, the Government supervision might make all the differ ence between success and failure. Still individual effort is indispensable in any case. It will not do to w*ait for Admiralties to take the initiative in such matters. This very thing Captain Osborn told the British geographers. And elo quently the noble sailor added, \" Columbus would"], [230, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 180 never have reached the new continent; the immortal Cook would never have-made his voyages round the world ; the illustrious names of Franklin, Ross, and Parry would not have been added to the rolls of fame ; if past Admiralties had been waited for to organise scientific research and geographical ex ploration.\" A Government expedition would, it is true, go with the certainty of being sustained until the objects sought to be achieved were either accom plished or given up as impossible of achievement. But in any case, this would undoubtedly mean important discoveries beyond the threshold of the region hitherto unpenetrated, if even the North Pole were not attained. Let, for example, two screw-steamers be sent out in the summer \u2014 either first to cruise in the Novaya Zemlya seas and examine the prospect in that direction, or direct to Spitzbergen \u2014 and, finding a secure harbour for one to remain in, try to push as far north as possible in the autumn with the other. As we have already seen, there are fair reasons for believing that 83\u00b0 N. might be reached in any case with the ship ; and if so fortunate as this, and yet ice-bound for the winter, resort should be had to sledges and boats"], [231, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 181 as early as practicable in the spring for pushing explorations northward, and in other directions. Assuming this latitude to be reached, it would place the explorers within 420 geographical miles of the Pole. The English Expedition hopes to get within 500 miles of the North Pole ; they hardly expect to get nearer with the ships. The rest of the way they expect to do with sledges and boats ; for, be it noted, the English Expedition provides also for an \" open sea \" at the Pole, although the idea is opposed by their ruling geographers. To keep to the ship as long as possible would, we think, be preferable to adopting entirely Parry's plan, resorting to boats and sledges only when compelled to do so in case of becoming hopelessly fast in the pack. The object of the remaining ship would be to afford relief in case of possible aban donment of the pioneer vessel, and to secure the return of the exploring party from Spitzbergen. But in event of the worst, there is very little danger of the actual loss of the pioneer party. Captain Nares, the gallant leader of the present English Expedition, and an officer possessed of practical Arctic experience, has given us his opinion on this point in very unqualified lan guage, and also shown what might be expected"], [232, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 182 from such a sledge-and-boat enterprise. In a paper which he wrote some years ago, he says, \" It is now a comparatively easy matter to start with six or eight men, and six or seven weeks' provisions, and travel some 600 miles across snowy wastes and frozen seas, from which no sustenance can be obtained. There is now no known position, however remote, from which a well-equipped crew could not effect their escape by their own unaided efforts.\" Lieutenant Payer bore testimony to the great encouragement these words afforded him and his companions when their ship became inextricably beset, and when she was finally abandoned in the 80 th parallel of latitude. The probabilities of a glorious success, or at least of making important discoveries, will, we think, far outbalance, for the men who shall thus do and dare, the risks of being swallowed up and never heard of more. In the first place, it is hardly probable that im portant lands would not be found to exist in the unexplored waste of the European Polar regions, although the increasing depth of the ocean directly north, or west of north, from Spitzbergen, would seem to indicate the reverse of this, so far as ex plorers have been able to penetrate."], [233, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 183 We think Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land may be but two large islands of an extensive archi pelago, either extending northward or circling round on the 81st and 8 2d parallels towards President's Land and Grant Land. Gilies Land, lying between Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land, and discovered and charted (half imaginatively) nearly two cen turies ago, is thought hy Mr. Lamont to be of con siderable extent, and to reach, perhaps, far to the northward ; and it is possible that Wrangell Land and other lands far over towards Behring's Straits might themselves be found to be but a part of a vast island system really existing, if the fact were but understood, in the unknown region round the Pole. Dr. Petermann entertains the theory that Green land extends far over towards Wrangell Land and the Siberian coast ; and Admiral Ltltke has indicated, what amounts to the same thing, that Wrangell Land is an island, or group of islands, which may extend to or perhaps touch Greenland. This theory, however, converts the Smith Sound route into a cul-de-sac, or at all events cuts it off from the Pole, which we do not think warranted by any analogies arrived at through explorations so far as they have extended northward by this route ; nor"], [234, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 184 can we conceive of such a configuration of Green land as this theory involves.* * However little importance may be attached by geographers gene rally to the theory here alluded to, it is perhaps due to the emi nent geographer who advanced it, and to our subject, to quote the following sentence from Dr. Petermann's first letter (Proc, vol. ix. p. 93) explanatory of this point. That writer says, \" From the total absence of drift-wood north of Smith Sound, I conclude that those inlets can have no connection with the Polar Sea on the Asiatic side and off the continental coast of North America, and that a neck of land not far to the north of Cape Parry, as seen by Morton in 82\u00b0, turns those waters into a bay.\" He then adds that \" the supposition of land stretching from Cape Parry as far as the North Pole is a mere specu lation founded on nothing but the wish that it should be the case.\" Upon this point it may be observed that Captain Tyson \u2014 \" freeing himself,\" he says, \" entirely, in describing the hydrography of Smith Sound, from the geographers, chartmakers, and romancers\" \u2014 expresses a positive opinion that \" on the west side, above what is called Grin nell Land, far north of Hayes's Cape Union, there is land ; \" for he could trace the coast with the spyglass leading northward as far as the eye could see. \" This coast-line is to the westward of the cape, but runs N. or N.N.E.\" He is inclined to think that the land trends to the eastward at about 82\u00b0 20' or 25' ; and owing to the moderateness of the current through Robeson Channel, and other reasons, he does not believe the theory of an open Polar Sea is war rantable, but rather that the space northward is occupied by an archipelago. He nevertheless has \" no doubt that Smith Sound is the ' true gateway to the Pole' \" (Arctic Experiences, p. 388, et seq.) Dr. Petermann, it should be remembered, has had already twice to extend the northward limit of Smith Sound and the channels beyond in his map of these regions : first, after Kane's considerable advance in that direction ; and, recently, on account of Hall's penetration to 82\u00b0 16' ; having unceasingly excluded Smith Sound from the cate gory of Polar routes since the publication of his first map in 1852, which shows Wellington Channel as the only opening into the Arctic Ocean between Greenland and Behring's Straits. We have indicated in outline Dr. Petermann's conception of Greenland, &c, on the principal map accompanying this work."], [235, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 185 But an expedition by Spitzbergen might do well to have an eye upon the Smith Sound route as a possible safety resort by which to return in case of reaching the Pole with only a boat-and-sledge party. The \"Polaris\" expedition found both the coasts of Greenland and Grinnell Land stretching away to the north as far as the eye could reach ; and other reasons would go to show that the land on one side or the other of Robeson Strait extends far towards the North Pole. Hence there would be the hope, in case of an expedition being shut within the Polar Sea, that it might by means of sledging facilities get out by the way of Smith Sound, or be reached by that way ; especially if an expedition were soon to be de spatched ; for, in the first place, there would be the chance of making a conjunction with Captain Nares' party ; secondly, an expedition could be pretty well assured of help reaching them sooner or later by that route, and certainly up to the time of the departure of the English ship \"Discovery.\" It is not unworthy of notice, however, that the English Expedition provides for just the reverse of this, by allowing for the possibility of the \"Alert's\" coming out on the European side, and pushing her way homeward by the east coast of Greenland,"], [236, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 186 aided by the current known to pass down that coast. But should a ship by the Spitzbergen route succeed in reaching the Pole, there would probably be found more than one current that would bear it with comparative certainty and safety back over the European threshold at some point or other. Far more important geographical results, more over, could reasonably be looked for by this route, in the event of navigation proving possible, than by the restricted route pursued by the English Expe dition. For the latter, although starting with two fully-manned ships, contemplates eventually reach ing the Pole only by a sort of processional march by sledges from the advance ship ; the gradually dwindling number of men who are expected to at tain that destination reminding one of a Robinson- Crusoe-like possession of that point, or of the half realistic pictures of Jules Verne.* * It is impossible not to admire both the ingenuity and caution displayed by the plan of the English Expedition in the respect to which we have alluded. Admiral Richards, when expressing his preference for the Spitzbergen route (Proceedings of the Royal Geo graphical Society, vol. ix. p. 123), thus briefly described the pro cess : \" To get from Smith Sound by sledges will probably require the whole resources of one ship. There will be six or seven sledges and sixty or seventy men .to drag them. It does not follow that the whole of the seven sledges will go to the North Pole ; six out of the seven will go to enable the seventh to get there, and the six will fall off as soon as they have performed their particular function of feeding"], [237, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 187 We have already alluded to the obvious preference for ship-exploration over that of sledging, if any extended knowledge is to be acquired of the bound less North Polar area. Both the advantage and the seventh, and return to the ship one by one. Therefore the seventh sledge and ten men will be all that will arrive at the North Pole.\" Referring the reader for particulars respecting the English naval system of Arctic sledge-travelling, and for details as arranged for the present expedition, to important articles entitled \"The Arctic Expedition,\" contained in the \"Geographical Magazine\" for March, June, and November, 1875, we may, however, here describe the process by which the Pole is expected to be reached, in some what more detail than the quoted language has done it, it being a matter of no little interest. The spring travelling of 1876 was expected to commence about the 1st of April, when the \"Alert\" would have (already in the autumn) attained a point within 500 miles or 56 days of the Pole. From this point the important achievement will be left to be accom plished by a system of depots and auxiliary sledges. In the present case the force of the advance ship admits of but six sledges and 52 men entering upon this work, leaving 10 in the ship, including officers. Employing substantially the language of the magazine, let us call the sledges A, B, C, D, E, and F \u2014 five of 8 men, and one of 12 men. All start with 40 days' provisions, the object being to enable A to advance singly to the Pole ; F, the 12-man sledge, consequently having 480 rations, and the other five 320 rations. After 5 days F has 432 rations left, and requires 60 to go home. He fills up the other five sledges (who by that time are down to 288 rations) to 320 rations again, leaves 176 rations at the Dep6t I., and returns (assuming they all started on April 1st) on April 10th. He then comes out again to Depot I., consuming 120 rations out and home, and leaves 360 rations, making 536 at the depot. After another 5 days (10 days in all), E, in like manner, fills up the four other sledges to 320 rations, leaves 128 at Depot II. , and returns to Depot I. with the 32 that are left to him. He there fills up to 320, goes back to Depot II. with 288, leaves 256 there.'making 384 in all, and goes home. Two depots, at distances of 5 and 10 days from the ship, are now"], [238, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 188 the importance of this kind of exploration are well illustrated by what Sir James Ross accom plished in the Antarctic seas. In only three brief seasons he traversed no less than 41,500 miles ; or more than all the foot-explorations of the Frank lin search expeditions, extending over thirty-six stocked with 216 and 384 rations respectively, and four 8-man sledges are loaded with 40 days' provisions each, at a distance of 10 marches from the ship. Sledges D, C, B, and A then advance for 5 more days (15 in all), and find themselves with 280 rations. D fills up the other three sledges to 320, and keeps enough to take him back to Depot II. (128 rations), leaving 120 rations at Dep6t III. He takes enough at Dep6t II. to take him to the ship, and returns home. Three sledges then advance for 10 days (25 from the ship), when they have 248 rations left. Sledge C fills up the two others to 320 each, leaves 120 at Depot IV., and goes home, taking 40 at Depot III., 40 at Depot IL, and 40 at Depot I. B and A then go on until they are 36 days from the ship, when A is filled up to 320 rations, and left to do battle with the unknown obstacles ahead single handed. B leaves 80 rations at Depot V., takes up 48 at Dep6t IV., 40 at Depot III., the same at the other two, and so reaches the ship. Sledge A is now 36 marches from the ship, and filled up to 40 days' provisions. He presses onward to the North Pole until half are consumed, when he will be 56 marches from home on about May 26th ; and, we will hope, at the goal. He re turns to Depot V. in 20 days more, when all will be consumed. But he there finds 80 rations left by B, which take him to Depot IV., where he picks up 48, at Depot III. 40, at Depot II. 40, at Depot I. what more he requires, and so returns to the ship after an absence of 112 days. Thus it will be seen that the clockwork precision necessary in carrying out this plan, and the closely limited time given in the pursuit of their undeviating course, will allow of little opportunity for making observations and discoveries, either by the several sledge partiea going and coming, or by the last 8 men \u2014 the fortunate \" A's.\""], [239, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 189 years;* and his discovery of Victoria Land, the work of a single month, was pronounced by the President of the Royal Geographical Society, when presenting him with the gold medal his services had earned, to be \" the greatest geographical dis covery of modern times.\" An expedition by this route, resolutely determin ing thus to brave the winter, if need be, in the moving pack \u2014 for it is only too certain that the pack is not stationary, even in winter \u2014 would surely be one of the boldest of Arctic enterprises, and hardly less so (assuming it at all possible of execution) would be a real North Pole journey on the plan of Parry's attempt. But, with the perfec tion to which Arctic navigation and sledge-travel ling have been brought, the probabilities of success are greatly enhanced ; while, as we have shown, there is very little doubt of the ultimate return of the exploring party. This, undoubtedly, is one of the practical ques tions to consider in connection with determined researches in the Arctic seas. However, the case of Barents so long ago, the safe return of Parry's party itself, of all the expeditions to the American * Estimated by Sir Leopold M'Clintock at about 40,000 miles (Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. ix. p. 43)."], [240, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 190 Polar regions since the ill-fated Franklin, and lastly, the rescue of the Austro-Hungarians in these very seas, after their remarkable experience, all evidence the probable safety attending that which might justly be deemed a rash adventure. But who would now think of saying that the expeditions to which we have alluded had better not have been under taken, or that the results did not abundantly repay the risks and outlay ? This may well afford real encouragement to re newed Arctic enterprise. And should not the Dutch do something more than look on and applaud the work of others ? The numerous expeditions and cruises undertaken in the Arctic seas by the Swedes, Norwegians, North Germans, Austrians, and Ameri cans, within the few past 3*ears, have, as Sir Henry Rawlinson has suggested, kept the attention of geo graphers steadily turned to the problems remaining for solution in the far North ; and now we have the strong and promising expedition which England has sent out in emulation of the enterprises of these several nations, with Smith Sound for her route and the North Pole for her objective point ; leaving the old field of Dutch Northern enterprise untenanted to beckon through past memories to the Netherland ers to come and take possession of their inheritance."], [241, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 191 The Dutch Society for the Promotion of Industry, prompted by these very facts, has, through its Board of Directors, recently presented an important address to the King of the Netherlands, calling his Majesty's attention to this subject, which address we should not omit to notice.

It is the firm conviction of that Society that these dis covery voyages cannot fail, in the first place, to extend our knowledge of the Northern Seas, their inhabitants and their coasts, and that then this enlarged knowledge must necessarily lead to the extension and development of the fisheries, com merce, and navigation in these regions ; that the fact, moreover, of the Dutch nation in the past having been foremost in such adventures is itself __> a sufficient warrant for the Society's pressing this matter upon the attention of the Government ; and that while trade and navigation may be expected to be particularly advantaged by them, the interests of science will at the same time be promoted. Another feature brought out prominently in the address is the advantage which is sure to accrue to"], [242, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 192 a branch of industry standing in direct relationship to navigation and to pure scientific inquiry \u2014 to wit, shipbuilding and shipping interests in general. By Polar voyaging, it is contended, experience in the proper equipment of ships, in accurate obser vations, the education of skilful naval officers and vigilant seamen, will all be greatly promoted ; and it is considered, moreover, that the present state of the Dutch merchant marine, and the competition between steam and sailing vessels, which is daily increasing, renders the moment opportune for Holland's taking up this subject, and striving for a revival of her once-flourishing whaling trade and seal-fisheries ; and fittingly the directors point to the recent successful efforts of some of the active citizens of Enkhuyzen for the establishment of a company for engaging in these Northern enter prises. It is noticeable, too, that the Dutch Society for the Promotion of Industry does not even despair, in view of the successful penetration of the Swedish and Russian expeditions to the mouths of the Sibe rian rivers (which, we may observe, the Dutch themselves demonstrated was possible two hundred and eighty years in advance of Nordenskiold), of being able yet to open up a commercial route, via"], [243, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 193 the north-east, \" for the produce of Central Asia, and tea from China ; \" but it takes a still broader view of this whole subject by advising also Ant- arctic voyages, rendered convenient by reason of their Eastern possessions for a base of operations, and ventures to suggest to his Majesty, in conclu- sion, that \"the question has arisen whether naval expeditions, often undertaken chiefly to afford a field of exercise for the navy, and for exhibiting the Dutch flag, might not be advantageously made ser- viceable for promoting the study of the natural sciences, and especially for obtaining a knowledge of the products of the several countries, by allow- ing young naturalists, burning with scientific ardour for the pursuit to which they wish to devote their lives, to take part in naval expeditions ; the ex- penses of the Treasury of the country being only thereby slightly increased, whilst the knowledge of distant countries, so invaluable for a commercial people to possess, would be enhanced at a trifling cost, and a way thus opened up by science for trade and industry.\" * The Dutch geographers \u2014 the Van Zoelens, the Veths, the Jansens, the Kans \u2014 may well feel that it * From the text of the address, given in De Standaard (Amster dam), No. 1241, April 10, 1876.

It would be but a weakening of the dig nity of their calling, however, to attempt to point out the cui bono of such a survey on their part by the hope of obtaining profitable commercial results, since it is quite enough for geographers to be assured that the scientific objects to be attained are worthy of the effort ; though undoubtedly with respect to Spitzbergen enterprises generally, there is a commercial feature that may justly be taken cognisance of by others. Sir John Barrow, for forty years Secretary of the English Board of Admiralty, has well put this point before us \u2014 and it would not do here wholly to pass over this renowned authority, so justly termed \"the mainspring of all Arctic enterprises.\" In language which Sir Roderick Murchison, in 1855, quoted most appositely to the British geographers, he says : \u2014 \" But it may be asked, ' Cui bono ' are these"], [245, "PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. 195 northern voyages undertaken .

We cannot perhaps more fitly conclude this part of our subject, therefore, and so bring to a point what has been already urged, than by adopt ing the words of the learned Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, himself a not less zeal ous advocate of Arctic research in our own times, nor less an Arctic authority, than was the learned Secretary of the Admiralty a generation since : \" It is a pity that the Dutch should not resume their Spitzbergen enterprises, and, reviving the memory of former achievements, once more take their place among Arctic explorers. Surely the countrymen of Barents, of Vlamingh, and of Linschoten have the old spirit left among them, and are ready to assume their rightful part in the same rank with explorers of other countries, who are now gathering and mar shalling their forces for an onslaught upon the vast unknown Polar region.\" * * The Threshold of the Unknown Region, 4th edition, p. 53."], [247, "( \u00bb97 . CHAPTER XII. ANTICIPATED RESULTS. The scientific results likely to accrue from an exa mination of the unknown North Polar area, by suc cessfully attaining the highest latitude, are hardly less numerous and important than the region to be explored is boundless in extent. The writer last quoted has well said upon this point : \"It may be shown that no such extent of unknown area, in any part of the world, ever failed to yield results of practical as well as purely scientific value ; and it may safely be urged that as the area exists, which is mathematically certain, it is impossible that its examination can fail to add largely to the sum of human knowledge. Further, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Polar area is, in many most im portant respects, of an altogether special character, affording exclusive opportunities of observing the condition of the earth's surface and physical pheno-"], [248, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 198 mena under certain extreme and singular circum stances, which are due to the relation of this area to the position of the axis of revolution of the ter restrial spheroid, and which have to be considered, not only with reference to the present time, but to the earth's past history. It may be received as cer tain that discoveries will be made in all branches of science, the exact nature of which cannot be anticipated.\" But sufficient for brief consideration are the more definitive results which may be said to be fairly ascertainable, and by which the boundaries of our knowledge in respect to the whole vast realm of physical science, long ago invaded and widely opened up to us by the wisdom of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Huygens, and other immortal names, would be greatly enlarged. The additions, for example, to our geographical and hydrographical knowledge ; the determination, by accurate geodetic measurement, of the precise shape of our globe ; observations fixing the power of the pendulum to measure heights, and other pen dulum experiments, such as would contribute to our knowledge of geodetic science, and rejoice some modern Huygens to conduct ; the solving of the problem of insolation; the ascertainment of the"], [249, "ANTICIPATED RESULTS. 199 amount of solar heat received by the earth, and locating the point of greatest cold ; the clearing up of numerous meteorological, magnetical, and electri cal questions ; and immensely adding to our infor mation in the domain of biology, and even in ethno logy, \u2014 these are some of the results which may be confidently looked for by such an expedition as is here advocated, if successful. In the words of M. Gustave Lambert, the scientific conquest of the Pole would fecundate all the sciences. Geography and cosmography would be the first to derive important advantage from an opening up, in even the smallest degree, of the unknown North Polar region. To ascertain whether the Arctic Ocean is one vast sea of ice, or whether important lands may not be scattered through it, but espe cially to settle the true configuration of Greenland, are matters of the first significance to geographical science. Some geographers have with reluctance defaced from their maps the coasts of that sea of which Baffin detected the limits ; but the last two ques tions handed down to us from the eighteenth century, besides the new ones that have arisen, re main to be answered by future Arctic expeditions. What really are the western coasts of Greenland ?"], [250, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 200 Are they prolonged indefinitely towards the Pole, or, trending to the west, may they there be traced ? England evidently has not had faith in the geo graphical theory of the distinguished editor of the \" Mittheilungen,\" and the tracing of the western coasts of Greenland may be left to her. But an expedition is wanted to penetrate to the Pole from the eastern side, in order to assist in solving these important questions. In the domain of geographi cal discovery Hollanders would be particularly at home ; and what Sir Edward Sabine has termed \" the greatest geographical achievement which can be attempted,\" would seem to be the most surely attainable by approaching the North Polar seas' through the wide ocean portal. Upon the advantage to the science of hydro graphy likely to be derived from an Arctic expedi tion by Novaya Zemlya or Spitzbergen little, per haps, need be said. Already the question of streams and currents has entered considerably into the dis cussion, as being of real moment and as inseparable also from the question of routes. But the impor tant question of currents is of practical interest with respect to navigation. The science of hydrography must determine this, and only through it can we arrive at a clear solution of the problem as to where"], [251, "ANTICIPATED RESULTS. 201 in the supposed open Polar Sea the Gulf Stream ex hibits its latest force and the Arctic current begins. Directly associated with this is the more strictly astronomical phenomenon of the oscil lations, or the rise and fall of the tide ; and we very well know that observations at the North Pole, and at intermediate points above latitudes which have been attained, would increase our knowledge upon this point. Kepler explains it by a succession of analogous movements to those of the flanks of an animal that respires, thus attri buting to the earth a kind of characteristic vitality. We know, indeed, to a certainty that the move ments of the waters of the ocean are in their prin cipal action controlled by the moon, and in their secondary action by the sun. The effect has been described by Alfred de Musset in a phrase as fine and poetical as it is purely French, \" The ocean, which rouses itself under the kisses of the pale moon.\" Thus from the question of currents even to that of tides, it is a matter of deep interest to \" discover the actual condition of this secluded ocean, which has never yet been cut by keel of mortal ship.\" The science of geodesy would profit amazingly by the series of pendulum observations which could be"], [252, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 202 made in the vicinity of the North Pole. This would offer the first opportunity for accurately ascertaining the shape of the earth. The nearest point to the North Pole at which the pendulum has been swung, of which we have the results, is at Spitzbergen, up wards of 600 miles to the south, in observations taken by Sir Edward Sabine, though careful ex periments were made by the scientific men of Captain Hall's expedition two degrees nearer ; being prescribed in accordance with the advice of the National Academy of Sciences.

Pendulum experiments give the law of change and gravity, and enable us to infer what is the ellipticity of the earth, provided the law of gravitation be true. If the ellipticity, thus formed, agrees with that calculated from trig onometrical surveys, it will be a strong proof of the correctness of the law of gravitation.\" This is but one simple department of science, yet from the example it affords it is easy to see how important is Arctic research. The Polar regions offer, perhaps, greater advan tages than any other part of the globe for the observation of natural phenomena of every kind, and our knowledge of terrestrial magnetism and atmospheric electricity will become not a little extended by means of an Arctic expedition gaining a high latitude. Whether these forces operate in an extraordinary degree, or whether on the whole less strongly than we have had reason to suppose, can only be ascertained by actual observations at the mysterious Northern axis of our globe. Already considerable advantage has been derived"], [254, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 204 from the careful observations made at Van Rens selaer Harbour, not only in these particulars, but in meteorology and astronomy, by Dr. Kane, and re duced and discussed by Charles A. Schott of the United States Coast Survey,* and also by the obser vations of Sir Edward Belcher, of Sir Leopold M'Clintock during the important voyage of the \" Fox,\" and by others. But it is altogether desir able to get nearer to the Pole, if possible, in order to renew similar observations. In solar and stellar chemistry, the additions to our knowledge in recent years have been numerous and important ; but we have the assurance of Pro fessor Roscoe that there is much remaining that needs to be settled concerning the solar corona and the zodiacal and auroral lights to give us a more perfect knowledge of chemistry as thus applied. In the department of optics, therefore, the obser vations of the spectrum, of the sun and of the aurora, and also of the study of the twilight, can not but be most important at that mathematical Northern focus of our planet, where the year con sists of one day and one night each of six months' duration. In fact, experiments upon these points * Smithsonian Contributions, vols. x., xi., xii., and xiii."], [255, "ANTICIPATED RESULTS. 205 can only be advantageously pursued in extreme latitudes. Among all the subjects recommended for inves tigation by the English Expedition, by the Arctic Committee of the Royal Society, and embraced in the \"Scientific Manual of Instructions\" \u2014 a book of nearly 800 pages, edited by Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S. \u2014 nothing, scarcely, is more largely dwelt upon than the subject of the Aurora Borealis. Lieutenant Weyprecht considers it as a phenomenon as yet defying all description and any systematic classification, but thinks it an atmospheric pheno menon with which meteorological conditions have much to do. The advance of spectrum analysis \u2014 through the scientific experiments of such eminent o physicists as Lockyer, Huggins, Janssen, and Ang strom \u2014 is certain to greatly facilitate such inves tigations. They can, however, only be prosecuted advantageously in high latitudes, when the path of the sun above the horizon gives special oppor tunities for the necessary observations. Nor is the Arctic winter so unpleasant a season for the pursuit of such observations. The long Polar night, with its flashing lights of the aurora borealis, is pronounced not only \" more endurable, but more enjoyable \" than the short days of the"], [256, "206 A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. same season in England, obscured by winter fogs ; and Dr. Kane says, \" The intense beauty of the Arctic firmament can hardly be imagined ; it looked close above our heads, with its stars magnified in glory ; and the very planets twinkling so much as to baffle the observation of our astronomer.\" It is almost needless to say that the climate of the northern hemisphere depends in great part upon the atmospheric conditions of the Arctic regions, and herein lies one of the most important subjects for investigation. The temperature of the air at the North Pole has long furnished a fruitful theme of speculation, both in connection with the influence of the sea and the sun. In an interesting paper on the climate of the North Pole, by Mr. W. E. Hickson, read some time since before the Royal Geographical Society, that writer says : \"It has always been popularly sup posed that the immediate areas of the Poles must be the coldest regions of the globe, because the farthest points from the equator. Hence the argu ment that the higher: the latitude the greater must be the difficulties and dangers of navigation. Quite an opposite opinion, however, had begun to prevail among meteorologists on the publication, in 1817, of the Isothermal system of Alexander von Hum-"], [257, "ANTICIPATED RESULTS. 207 boldt, which showed that distance from the equator is no rule for cold, as the equator is not a parallel maximum of heat. The line of maximum heat crosses the Greenwich meridian, in Africa, 15\u00b0 north of the equator, and rises, to the eastward, 5\u00b0 higher, running along the southern edge of the Desert of Sahara. \" In 1821,\" continues Mr. Hickson, \"Sir David Brewster pointed out, in a paper on the mean tem perature of the globe, the probability of the ther mometer being found to range 10\u00b0 higher at the Pole than in some other parts of the Arctic Circle. No new facts have since been discovered to invali date this conclusion \u2014 many, on the contrary, have come to light tending to confirm it.\"* Hence astronomical observations, the knowledge of those regions, and of the distribution of land and water, observations concerning the temperature of the sea at different depths, concerning the tempera ture and pressure of the atmosphere, and the study of the ruling winds in relation to the currents, must necessarily afford improved means of under standing the meteorology of our more temperate latitudes. The country which shall now employ its scientific * Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. xxxv. pp. 129, 130."], [258, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 208 reserve in pushing onward Arctic research has before it the splendid possibility of being first to gain such a knowledge of the Polar phenomena of the globe as may afford the data for accurately predicting the nature of the seasons, the absolute demand of modern science ; \" but surely \" \u2014 to use the words of Dr. Balfour Stewart, as applied to England when she was hesitating upon this subject \u2014 \" we cannot expect Nature, who is usually so reticent, will dis close her secrets to a nation or a race who will not take reasonable trouble to complete their knowledge of the physics of the earth.\" In the department of zoology, the North Polar world affords extensive scope for interesting obser vations. The animal kingdom, strangely enough, if perhaps less profusely represented amidst the frosts and snows of the far North than in the tropical and the more temperate latitudes, is in no respect deficient in magnitude and singularity near the Pole. In mammalia, the cetacean speci mens are proved to be abundant, as also the mol lusca; but naturalists are instinctively asking for more facts bearing upon the distribution, or possi bly the gradual disappearance of mammalian types towards the Pole, and Arctic expeditions of the future must give the answer to all such ques-"], [259, "ANTICIPATED RESULTS. 209 tions. It is sufficiently well known, moreover, that numerous remains of animals exist in the far North belonging to a period not very remote, which give evidence of having once been habi tants of tropical regions, to which their descendants are now confined. In regard to bird life, perhaps even in numbers, no other part of the globe can equal the Arctic regions in certain seasons. We have already spoken of the migratory birds found to be so numerous in high northern latitudes, and apparently seeking still more Arctic climes, as constituting one of the strongest arguments in favour of an open Polar sea. Professor Newton of Cambridge has made some in teresting investigations upon this subject, and dis cerned, what we have already shown, that these northern migrations of a certain group of birds tend to the conclusion \"that beyond a zone where a rigorous \"summer reigns, there may be a region endued with a comparatively favourable climate.\" Well may he conclude, \" If so, surely the condi tions which produce such a climate are worth inves tigating.\" Geological investigations are already well begun by what has been done in Greenland, Spitzbergen, and Novaya Zemlya ; but especially by Professor vol. 1. \u00b0"], [260, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 210 Nordenskiold in North Spitzbergen. This begin ning has abundantly demonstrated that the Arctic field is a most important one in this respect, and that its cultivation cannot fail to bring to light many new and interesting facts in the domain of geology, and hardly less in that of pal\u00e6on tology. Professor Geikie tells us that once \" a great part of England and of Europe and North America was buried under the ice like Greenland. Earlier still it had its jungles, and palms, and other tropical plants ; yet further back it lay beneath a wide deep ocean ; and beyond that time can be traced many still more remote periods, when it was forest-covered land or wide marshy plains, or again buried under the great sea.\" It is clear, too, that Greenland itself might point to changes through the long vista of the ages equally remarkable. Captain Tyson, whose \" Experiences \" fairly entitle him to rank as the historian of Captain Hall's expedition, says the entire land round Polaris Bay is covered with marine fossils, showing that both the plains and the highest mountains have at some remote period been an ocean-bed. He found three fossilised sea snails, one on top of a mountain; and \"at the height of two thousand feet the clam-shells were so"], [261, "ANTICIPATED RESULTS. 211 thickly scattered that one could not put his foot down without crushing them.\"* In respect to fossil animals and plants the Polar regions are regarded as richer than those of any other part of the globe. To complete the history of the earth, therefore, it is necessary that much more in formation be given us by daring explorers concern ing the geology and pal\u00e6ontology of the Arctic world. In the distinctive department of mineralogy the Arctic regions, if not the richest on the globe, are certainly not wholly wanting in interest. The Arctic steamers voyaging to the American Polar seas replenish their coal supplies from the native hills of Disco ; and Captain Allen Young brought home from his short \" Pandora \" cruise more than forty mineralogical specimens, according to the list given us by Lieutenant Koolemans Beynen in his description of that voyage, and as named by Professor Behrens of Delft, t Cryolite, with which this list is headed, has a commercial value * Arctic Experiences, edited by E.

Arctic research, therefore, may in no slight degree extend our knowledge of the mineral riches of the earth. Modern ethnography, moreover, assures us of changes in circumpolar lands of comparatively recent date, and upon this point it is desirable to know more. Even respecting Scandinavia, we have the remarkable testimony of Pliny, Mela, Solinus, and others \u2014 according to Mr. Henry Ho worth, an eminent authority of our time\u2014 that Scandinavia was considered by the Roman geo graphers to be an archipelago. Ptolemy, indeed, speaks of the Scandinavian islands. And with re gard to the more strictly circumpolar lands, nearly every Northern explorer from Von Wrangell to Hall attests the fact, for such it may be termed, of their gradual upheaval, from having once been islands in the Arctic. In the American Polar regions, Frank lin in the west and Dr. Richardson in the east bear out this fact, while Dr. Kane has given most impor tant testimony regarding the gradual upheaval of Greenland. Explorers of Spitzbergen also speak of the same process as silently at work there. Hardly less important in this respect, then, would"], [263, "ANTICIPATED RESULTS. 213 be investigations in the extensive islands of the European Polar seas, Spitzbergen included. The botanical results from an Arctic expedi- tion, even by the ocean ways we have suggested, might prove of great importance, although regions wrapped in perpetual ice would not naturally be looked upon as favourable to the germination of plants and trees. Spitzbergen and Greenland are rich in flora. The annalist of Captain Hall's expe- dition states that there were many species of flora found at Thank God Harbour, Newman Bay, some highly variegated, and of most beautiful colours, but odourless. Not only were the forms most ele- gant and graceful, but the colours were as brilliant as tropical flowers ; and in many spots the groups or patches gave the appearance of fairy gardens, presenting a striking contrast to the rugged region in which they were found. Dr. Hooker has also pointed out that the flora of Greenland, though one of the most poverty-stricken on the globe, is pos- sessed of unusual interest ; and Von Heuglin found 290 kinds of plants in Spitzbergen, and no less than 226 in Novaya Zemlya. The study of the distribution of these would be greatly facilitated by an Arctic expedition. In the event of finding land at the North Pole,"], [264, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 214 especially should Greenland be found to extend far in that direction, an interesting \u2014 perhaps the most interesting \u2014 problem to solve by the enlightened Arctic explorer will be the ethnological one. More over, should the \" open Polar sea \" prove a reality, it is not less certain that light would be shed upon this question by an expedition penetrating to the highest latitude. It might reveal an actually exist ing race akin to the \" Arctic Highlanders,\" of which Sir John Ross considered there were evident traces in Greenland anterior to the Eskimo \u2014 an almost prehistoric race of men, Asiatic in origin \u2014 in which he has been sustained by the opinions of Arctic authorities no less eminent than Baron von Wran gell, Kane, Inglefield, General Sabine, and Mr. Markham ; the latter, indeed, having made special investigations relative to this subject. There even now exist traditions among the Eskimo tribes of far Northern lands peopled by superior beings to themselves, where herdsmen fatten their musk oxen, and where live men with long beards having churches and clocks \u2014 not so different, indeed, from the theory Grotius entertained, but which even the early Dutch expeditions very easily exploded. More pertinent, however, to the immediate subject, and most creditable to the perception of this great"], [265, "ANTICIPATED RESULTS. 215 man, is the following opinion of Grotius as to the common origin of the far Northern races of the Old and New World, given a century before the discovery of Behring's Straits : \" I should not dare assert whether they \" (the Russians, with whom the Dutch voyagers talked at Waigatz) \" had not heard something of that strait between Tartary and America, of which the common origin of the two peoples, apparent from looks and manners, evidences the existence.\"* Certain it is that inhabitants have been found as high in Greenland as 79\u00b0; and in latitude 81\u00b0 30' N.

There was a still more remote period when fine forests of exogenous trees clothed the hillsides of Disco, where groves waved in a milder climate over Banks' Land and Melville Islands, and where corals and sponges flourished in the now frozen waters of Barrow's Straits.

The first or Arctic group he styles, with Agassiz, \" Hyper boreans,\" divided into a chain of four littoral tribes, occupying a tract of country, all of it a narrow seaboard scarcely 100 miles in width, the linear extent of which is estimated at not less than 5000 miles, and made up as follows \u2014 viz.: the Eskimo, who occupy the Arctic shore of North"], [268, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 218 America from the mouth of the Mackenzie River to Kotzebue Sound ; the Koniagas, who, commencing at Kotzebue Sound, across the Kaviak Peninsula, border on Behring Sea from Norton Sound south ward, and stretch over the Alaskan Peninsula and Konigan Islands to the mouth of the Atna or Copper River ; the Aleuts, or people of the Aleutian Archipelago ; the Thlinkeets, who inhabit the coast and islands from the Atna to the Nass River. These four tribes, all nearly related to each other, are often classed as Eskimos ; and the picture drawn by Mr. Bancroft of this hyperborean group, par ticularly the Eskimos, is interesting, full, and in structive. An able reviewer of Mr. Bancroft's work, describ ing the narrow, gloomy life of this far Northern race of men, says : \" This shore-inhabiting Eskimo tribe is held by many authorities to be the only American people directly connected with the races of another continent. Behring's Strait offers to the inhabitants of both the Asiatic and American coasts an easy canoe transit, nor can certain ethnological affinities be denied. This strange northern man,\" he continues, \" whose cheerless life seems clinging to forbidding nature against such awful odds, is he not oppressed, saddened, and for ever cast down by"], [269, "ANTICIPATED RESULTS. 219 the bitter rigours of his environment ? Can he have an instant's thought beyond food and warmth . Is it not all with him battle and sleep ? Behold him, on the contrary, a sleek, fat, oleaginous fellow, with plenty of good nature, developing, besides the ordi nary human courage and ingenuity in capturing his daily food, a few customs we are wont to deem the privileges of civilisation. Eskimo government,\" he adds, \" is patriarchal, and men become venerated as they distinguish themselves in bold pursuits of the whale. Blubber, as in New Bedford, lubricates the avenue to greatness.\" * An insight into the life and habits of the modern Eskimo would seem to afford only slight encourage ment to the anthropological inquirer. Especially does one wonder how so lethargic a being as he could have wandered across the American continent, surmounting glaciers and icy seas, and taken up his abode, perhaps ages ago, in apparently isolated Greenland, to become the \" Arctic Highlander,\" of which there are said to be such evident traces both on the eastern and western sides.

The scientific bearings of Arctic research, it will readily be seen, are of very great importance; and fairly numerous as is our list of the results which may be looked for, there are many lesser but still interesting points that might be noted. Un doubtedly geographical discovery may of right take the first place ; but Lieutenant Weyprecht has urged the preference of scientific labour, com plaining that the conquest of the physical difficulties has usurped the place of this. He proposes that stations should be established for at least a year at Novaya Zemlya, East or West Greenland, North America, East of Behring's Straits, and in Siberia, at the north of the Lena, to record a series of synchronous observations for comparison at various points, the expenses to be divided among the several nations. While we would cordially endorse such co-opera tive action on the part of the various Governments, we would go somewhat farther, and raise the question whether the countries, whose past interest in Arctic exploration would entitle them to be classed among the friends of Northern enterprise and of scientific progress, should not league together, so to speak, and"], [272, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 222 arrange a system of graduated rewards for dis coveries, by whomsoever made, in this vast mys terious realm, which belongs broadly to science, but which no single nation cares to claim."], [273, "223 CHAPTER XIII. CONCLUSION. Thus have we presented, in a succinct form, the general features of the North Polar question, and we have anticipated the more important results to be looked for from a successful Arctic expedition. The climatic changes this far Northern region is undergoing, no less than the ethnological, ethno graphical, and various other problems to which we have alluded, enter into the grand sum of pheno mena which modern Arctic research is expected to reveal to us, and which now lie concealed behind the 80th parallel of latitude. The importance of this research, and of a more accurate knowledge of our globe, it is impossible now to estimate. The accomplished Secretary of the Dutch Geographical Society has well said that \" when Columbus discovered America, no one realised the great importance of the dis-"], [274, "A DUTCH ARCTIC EXPEDITION AND ROUTE. 224 covery ; nay, many even lamented that this land obstructed the way to India.\"* And pertinently he asks, \" Who would now venture to estimate the value of the immense influence this discovery of Columbus has had upon Europe, and indeed upon the whole world ?\" And also, to quote the learned President of our own American Geographical Society, Mr. Justice Daly (uttered in June, 1871), \"If now it should be possible to reach the Pole, and to make accurate observations at that point from the relation which the earth bears to the sun, and to the whole stellar universe, the most useful results are likely to follow, in a more tho rough knowledge of our globe.\" For the achievement of these grand objects the enlightened nations of the earth are beginning to re-enlist themselves. Will Holland remain behind in a work so peculiarly the province of a proud maritime nation, and in which formerly she won some of her brightest laurels ? The considerations we have set forth to engage her to re-enter upon this work, and to attempt the Pole by the nearest and most direct route possible from Holland, will, we trust, commend itself to the judgment of the * N. W. Posthumus, De Nederlanders en de Noordpoolexpeditien, p. 30."], [275, "CONCLUSION. 225 Government and scientific men of the Netherlands, and to the whole country. Columbus's promise of a \"way to the east by the west\" has. never been forgotten, and the great majority of Arctic explorers have steadily sought to open a north-western route. Nothing has seemed to deter seamen from pursuing this track ; while the wide ocean portal, which so specially invites European explorers, appears to be comparatively neglected. It seems, therefore, to be left to the countrymen of Barents to prove its real value. And to the re newed search in this direction, which geographers regret has not yet been authoritatively taken up by those to whom it belongs by a prerogative of inheritance, the Netherlanders may find further stimulus in the following words, inspired by the thrilling story of the very voyages that won for Holland her early Arctic fame, which we quote from the historian of the United Netherlands : \u2014 \"What heart has not thrilled with sympathy and with pride at the story of the magnificent exploits, the heroism, the contempt of danger and of suffering which have characterised the great navigators whose names are so familiar to the world ?

To win the favour of that noblest of mistresses, Science ; to take authoritative possession, in her name, of the whole domain of humanity ; to open new pathways to commerce ; to elevate and enlarge the human intel lect, and to multiply indefinitely the sum of human enjoyments : this is truly to be the pioneers of a possible civilisation, compared with which our present culture may seem but a poor barbarism.\""], [277, "APPENDIX.

(complete in itself, with Index) os THE DUTCH IN THE ARCTIC SEAS Being a Survey of the North Polar Question, including Extended Considerations for the Renewal of Dutch Arctic Research. by SAMUEL RICHARD VAN CAMPEN, F.R.G.S., corresponding member of the dutch and american geographical societies, author of \"Holland's silver feast,\" etc. LONDON : TRUBNER & CO., LUDGATE HILL. PRESS OPINIONS OF THE WORK AND ITS OBJECT. \" To stimulate Holland to maritime enterprise in the Polar Seas by a spirited record of the toils of Dutchmen of an earlier generation, and by narrating the deeds of those bold seamen of other nations who have sought to emulate, and if possible excel, the exploits of their predeces sors, is the laudable aim and ambition of Mr. Samuel Richard Van Campen, author of ' Holland's Silver Feast,' and also the historian of the carefully-compiled, well-written, readable, and interesting volume now under review. The author is plain-spoken, generous in his love and recognition of the labours of men. . . . Mr. Van Campen has made a careful study of Arctic exploration, and is equally at home whether discussing Dutch, English, American, or Austrian enterprise. . . . Mr. Van Campen has done excellent service to historic lore by this his first volume of ' The Dutch in the Arctic Seas.' \" \u2014 Morning Post, August 1876."], [316, "2 The Spectator (7th October 1876) says: \"Mr. Van Campen deserves the thanks, not only of his own countrymen, but of all those interested in Arctic research, for the wise efforts he is making to draw fresh atten tion to the subject.\" A long review, dealing with the significance of the subject of the volume, thus concludes : \"We will only add that, in a work full of suggestive and interesting detail, the main thread of thought is anxiety to stir the people and Government of Holland to fresh enter prise in Arctic research, and following up the route of their old country man, Barents, to open up a north-eas' pathway to the Pole.\" \" Although a second volume is promised, that before us is complete in itself, and deals fully with the various routes to the Pole, paying a high tribute to English enterprise. The next will deal with the history of Dutch expeditions in the past. The volume before us is well argued, readably written, and opportunely published.\" \u2014 Standard. \" Mr. Van Campen urges many arguments in favour of Arctic explora tion, and especially in favour of its resumption by the Dutch. . . . Mr. Van Campen does not hold up the Pole as the only chief goal of Arctic exploration ; he shows, forcibly and fully, the many great gains to science and humanity which are to be obtained by a perfectly-equipped Arctic expedition. . . . For English readers who want, in a short space, to get a knowledge of the arguments in favour of Arctic exploration, of the discussions of the various routes, of an ' open Polar sea,' and the configuration of the unknown region, Mr. Van Oampen's volume will prove useful.\" \u2014 Nature. \"The question of routes occupies a large portion of this \u2014 the first instalment of Mr. Van Campen's work \u2014 and is very fully discussed ; Mr. Van Campen believing that the route to the Pole, for ships taking Spitz bergen for their base of operations, is one which should be tried with great probability of success by the aid of the Gulf Stream. In fact, he wants to see Parry's attempt repeated with screw-steamers. He enume rates the scientific results which must, and those which may, be looked for from a successful effort to reach the North Pole, and uses all his eloquence to incite some to make fresh ventures.\" \u2014 Westminster Review, October 1876. \" It was only right that such a book should be written. . . . We heartily hope that Mr. Van Campen may prove the Prince Charming to awaken the slumbering spirit of Arctic enterprise in Holland.\" \u2014 The Globe, 26th August 1876."], [317, "3 \"It (the book) is an elaborate argument in favour of sending the Dutch to the Arctic Seas, where, as a nation, they have not been repre sented by an exploring expedition for 250 years past. . . . The volume represents a large amount of conscientious reading, and contains on the whole a fair and valuable summing up of the information bearing on the approaches to the Polar basin.\" \u2014 The Scotsman, 15th September 1876. \" The first volume of Mr. S. R. Van Campen's ' The Dutch in the Arctic Seas ' partakes equally of the nature of a history, a description, and an appeal ; for Mr. Van Campen is not unmindful of the heroic exploits of Barents and Heemskerck, and longs to see Holland once more take her place in the van of Arctic exploration. . . . The arguments in the present volume are in favour of the Spitzbergen route as opposed to that through Smith's Sound.\" \u2014 Daily News. \"The author of this interesting work, of which tlie first part only is yet before us, is a worthy representative of those enthusiastic scientists whose special knowledge serves them but as a stimulus to further re search, and whose active intelligence in the promotion of geographical discovery proves itself well worthy of national enterprise. . . . His book is a comprehensive survey of the question, showing the difficulties and dangers, and the splendid gains to be won from such exploration, with equal force and candour; and we shall all gladly hail whatever intelligent and spirited rivalry Holland or any other nation may set up in a field whose honours are open to all, and worthy of all\"\u2014 Liverpool Weekly Albion, 19th August 1876. \" Double interest attaches itself to the book. It is, first, a history of the ancient feats of the Dutchmen; and it is, next, a piece of powerful advocacy of a line of progress that English navigators have generally disregarded. . . . We can compliment Mr. Van Campen on the way in which he has accomplished his task, and express our hope that the spur he has applied to the sides of Hollanders will be sharp enough to prick them to the effort he advocates.\"\u2014 Sunday Times. \" We can recommend the new work of Mr. Van Campen to all those persons who take an interest in this subject.\"\u2014 Morning Advertiser. Mr. Blanchard Jerrold, in the course of a long review in Lloyd's Weekly London Newspaper, says: \"Mr. Van Campen is an ardent enthusiast on Arctic questions ; his energy knows no bounds, his enterprise surmounts"], [318, "4 all barriers. He would have Hollanders hold the proud place they once held as explorers and travellers. . . . Mr. Van Campen's most interest ing volume pleads powerfully in favour of Dutch enterprise. It remains to be seen whether his arguments will have any effect on those whom he hopes to rouse. Putting that question aside, however, we may warmly recommend the book on all grounds. Its stirring interest is undoubted, \u2014 has not the North Pole an insurmountable fascination for us all ? \u2014 and Mr. Van Campen's enthusiasm is infectious. He takes his readers with him into his eagerness and earnestness ; and we may add, that he is lavish in his praise of the English people as explorers and travellers. No Englishman can read this wholesome, invigorating book without feeling a thrill of satisfaction at the vast work achieved in the broad domain of scientific progress by the nation of shopkeepers.\" \" An interesting record is here given of maritime adventure, and though the author, as is natural from his chosen standpoint, gives special pro minence to the doings of Dutchmen, due credit is accorded to English mariners for their efforts in this direction.\" \u2014 City Press. \" An enthusiastic, and, on the whole, ably-written plea for a Dutch expedition of discovery, in friendly rivalry with Great Britain, not by the already occupied Smith's Sound route, but by the seas between Nova Zembla and Spitzbergen.\" \u2014 The Graphic, 5th August 1876. \" Holland has resources and spirit quite equal to follow up her former efforts, and to engage in a new expedition towards the Pole. The prac ticability of such an expedition, and the route which it should take, are very carefully discussed. . . . The English, we are certain, will cordially welcome a renewal of enterprise in this direction on the part of the Dutch, and we hope that the object of the present volume will be accom plished.\" \u2014 Literary World. \" Is exceedingly interesting.\" \u2014 Publishers' Circular. \" Mr. Van Campen's first volume is a summary of what has been done by other nations, a comparison of the various routes, and a general view of the results that may be anticipated from Polar discovery, to the advan tage and promotion of many departments of science.\" \u2014 Bookseller. \" Will be read with much interest.\" \u2014 Daily Telegraph. \"Mr. Van Campen is a native of New York, who takes a deep and"], [319, "5 romantic interest in the land of his ancestors, and he is, above all things, anxious that Holland should revive her maritime greatness by despatch ing an Arctic expedition of discovery. . . . We welcome Mr. Van Cam pen's volume as a serviceable review of what has recently been written on Arctic exploration.\"\u2014 Geographical Magazine. \" There can be no doubt of the exhaustive knowledge which Mr. Van Campen possesses of his subject.\"\u2014 Public Opinion. \" Mr. Van Campen's book comes at an auspicious time, and goes far to exhaust the subject, as it treats not only of the Dutch in the Arctic Seas, but of the attempts to reach the Pole from the beginning, and of all the discoveries made.\" \u2014 A nc/lo- American Times. \" The author shows the valuable and interesting results obtainable by well-organised and well-conducted expeditions for this purpose, and gives some interesting information on the point . . . and concludes with an excellent chronological table of Arctic voyages, north-east and north west of Greenland, which will be found very useful.\" \u2014 The Navy. Dr. A. Petermann, the editor of the Mittheilungen, says : \" Mr. Van Campen's work on the Arctic Regions could not have been published at a more fitting time than the present, when the English expedition under Captain Nares has returned, and its results are before us. . . . \" All the modern research in the Arctic and Antarctic was exclusively done by the English, Americans, French, Danes, Norwegians, Swedes, Russians, Austrians, and Germans ; the Dutch alone kept aloof, although they are first-rate geographers, have a flourishing Geographical Society, and fine surveys of their home and colonial possessions ; and, moreover, were 300 years ago on the tip-top of Arctic, Oceanic, and other explora tions. It is, therefore, quite a relief to find oi)6 Dutch gentleman, or at least a gentleman of Dutch descent, patriotic enough to stand up and say that also the Netherlands must do something in order not to be the only cultivated maritime nation in the world content with the ' rest and be thankful' manner. From what I know of the Dutch nation, I am fully convinced that Mr. Van Campen's appeal will not be made in vain.\" Herr W. Von Freeden, editor of Hansa, says : \" We experienced a peculiar sensation on the first glance at this appeal to the Dutch nation, reminding them of their ancient renown as the first explorers to the"], [320, "6 north of Europe, and calling upon them to enter into the competition with the other nations now striving to lift the veil in which nature has enveloped the mysteries beyond the 80\u00b0 of northern latitude up to the North Pole. . . . The book is written with enthusiasm, and displays great erudition. . . . The author forcibly reminds the Dutch people of the important discoveries made by their navigators more than three centuries ago, who brought back from the Arctic regions their indomitable spirit of enterprise, and thus contributed not a little to the proud position which the Netherlander occupied even so late as the beginning of the eighteenth century among the seafaring and warlike nations of Europe. The enthusiasm with which the learned author ventilates his plan makes us regret that this work had not appeared two years earlier, before the departure of the expedition of Captain Nares, as we should have found an important ally in the author. . . . \"In recommending the well-got-up first volume of the work before us to our readers, we anticipate the appearance of the second with pleasure, as it will no doubt contain matter touching the revival of Holland's interest in the case. The paper and the printing cannot be surpassed.\" \u2014Hansa, 29th October 1876. \" C'est une heureuse idee de faire revivre et de tirer de l'oubli les genereuses tentatives des marins hollandais dans la direction du P61e Nord. Personne n'ignore la memorable expedition de Barents a la Nouvelle-Zemble ; mais combien d'autres de ses compatriotes ont egale ment bien su meriter de la science geographique ; c'est ce que M. S. R. Van Campen a voulu rappeler dans son livre. Le premier volume est consacre a un resume\" general de l'histoire des expSditions au Pole Nord, et il etablit qu'\u201e c6te des trois projets anglais (Sherard Osborn), allemand (Aug. Petermann) et franqais (Gustave Lambert) il en existait depuis long temps un autre, le projet hollandais, qui avait pour direction les mers au nord de la Nouvelle-Zemble. ... II m.riterait certainement une traduc tion franchise, et nous le recommendons a tous ceux que la grande question de la navigation au Pole Nord interesse.\"\u2014 M. Malte-Brun, Geographical Correspondence in \"Le Nord,\" 9th October 1876. M. Charles Grad, in a report rendered to the French Geographical Society, says : \" Depuis le dernier voyage de Barents a Nouvelle-Zemble, les hollandais, apres avoir pris une part active a l'explorations des regions polaires, ont abandonn6 completement cette enterprise. M. Van Campen a voulu appeler l'attention de la Hollande sur la geographie arctique. II cherche a interesser le gouveruement hollandais a la recherche du"], [321, "7 pole. Admirateur enthousiaste des anciens navigateurs de ce pays, le savant ecrivain compare leurs audacieuses entreprises aux \u0153uvres des Ph6niciens, qui, dans leurs expeditions commerciales ont penetre\" dans les contrees les plus lointaines en accomplissant des decouvertes dont la re lation est maintenant perdue. Seulement tandis que les anciens voyages dans le Nord, a la recherche d'une route plus courte pour les Indes, avaient un but mercantile, il faudrait que l'expedition nouvelle que la Hollande devrait envoyer au pole s'inspir_t de l'int.ret unique de la science, a l'exemple donne par la Suede et l'Allemagne, par FAngleterre, les Etats-Unis et l'Autriche. Le sentiment qui anime M. Van Campen a tout notre sympathie et nous souhaitons certainement a son projet le meilleur succes possible. \" Si la Hollande ne s'etait pas preoccup.e seulement de ses interets commerciaux elle n'aurait pas renounce pendant des centaines d'annees a l'exploration scientifique de la zone polaire. Sa marine est aujourd'hui aussi puissante que jamais, sa prosp6rit6 aussi est remarquable. Rien ne l'empeche done de pendre sa part du mouvement de recherches qui ont le Pole Nord pour objectif. Les arguments de M. Van Campen trouveront bien un _cho et sauront persuader le gouvernement de La Haye et les hommes distingu.s qui tiennent la tete du mouvement scientifique dans ce pays. Quant a la voie a suivre, nous avons deja indique la region au nord de Nouvelle-Zemble et des lies Spitzbergen.\" \u2014 Bulletin de la Societe de Geographie, November 1876. Bet Vaderland (at the Hague) says : \" Mr. Van Campen, who, with respect to English readers, sets forth so meritoriously the importance of Arctic research, has, above all, earned the thanks of the Dutch nation, whose past he has investigated with so much zeal, in order to awaken it to new emulation, and to persuade it to again put its hand to the plough.\" Mr. A. J. Ten Brink, President of the Enkhuyzen Department of the Dutch Geographical Society, says : \" It may be regarded as certain that the reading of a book in which a foreigner endeavours to stimulate our nation to new undertakings in the Arctic Zone was to me a most agree able thing. ... But had the author even proceeded upon an entirely opposite plan, I should indeed have been unable to speak but in terms of undivided praise of a labour in which the Arctic question is treated soundly and exhaustively. ... As far as I am aware, the first volume only is yet published, which has for its more special object, after speak-"], [322, "( 3 ) ing of all the scientific expeditions and plans, and most of the questions connected with them, to point out to our nation the way to the far North. ... I wish the writer many readers in our country and elsewh'ere, and flatter myself especially with the hope that this volume will stimulate scientific men in Holland to take a deeper interest in Arctic affairs.\" \u2014 Nederlandsche Spectator, February 1877. Dr. M. Cohen Stuart, in prefacing in his magazine an article from an accomplished hand epitomising this work, says: \" Remarkable is the coin cidence that at the same time Lieutenant Beynen, in an English ship \" (on his first \"Pandora\" cruise), \"was upholding the honour of our marine in the Polar regions, in London Mr. Samuel R. Van Campen, im pelled by his ancestral love for Holland, came upon exactly the same idea, to the effect that, mindful of the example of the fathers, Holland's duty demanded that she should acquire anew an honourable place in that appropriate field of discovery and research. Pervaded with this conviction, he formed the resolution of writing a book upon the subject, under the title of ' The Dutch in the Arctic Seas,' of which the first volume, 'A Dutch Arctic Expedition and Route,' with an elegant map, appeared a few months ago in London and Amsterdam. . . . Coming into correspondence with Mr. Van Campen through my ' Zes Maanden,' . . . I became especially convinced of the innate concern and great zeal with which he undertook and has thus far accomplished his task. Along a theoretical way, and by diligent historical investigation, Mr. Van Campen arrived at almost entirely the same results as Lieutenant Beynen by means of practical knowledge and personal observation.\" \u2014 De Zaaier for May 1S77.
