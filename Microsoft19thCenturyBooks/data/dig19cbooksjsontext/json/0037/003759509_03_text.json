CHAPTER I. MAY MEETINGS. May, the month of promise and perfume, flung her hawthorn wreath over the country lanes as a challenge to summer. Boys tore down the houghs and dashed the scented blossoms to the ground, scattering the fragile petals around in odorous showers, as they carried off the white or crimson prize in triumph, flushed with the joy of ripened spring-time. There was a hlythe chirrup from the boughs, and a twitter from the budding hedgerows \u2014 the meadows were bright with tints of white and gold, enamelled in straggling patches on a ground of emerald \u2014 little children, clustered in groups, like the flowers they gathered, strayed through the woods and meadows, vol. in. n"], [10, "2 god's providence house. with pinafores tucked up and overcharged with cow slips for the nearest market, or for some neighbour ing farmer's thrifty wife, whose wine was made at home with the returning seasons' regularity. The brooks had a pleasant tinkle as they wandered on in the clear sunshine, babbling of primrose tufts, coiled up fern-fronds, nodding hyacinths, or scented violets hid in mossy nooks, kissed by the rippling wavelets as they flowed on, like restless unsatisfied humanity, from the narrow present, with its unregarded blooms, to the wider channels and more restless tides of the far off river where flowers like these are reflected never more. May ! \u2014 month of smiles and sunshine, the bridal of spring and summer, with an anthem from the birds, and a nuptial wreath on the boughs, had been chosen by Miss Wright as the fittest season for her own marriage \u2014 in short she had simpered out a con sent to become Mrs. Dutton, after a courtship of many moons' duration. Not that any sense of harmony between the sweet May and matrimony led to its adoption; no, the race-week was selected for the ceremony for the more unsentimental reason, that, as the week was a holiday perforce, by weddino- then nothing would be lost from business\u2014 they would economise time and coit : whereas a day or a week stolen at another period would interfere with Mr."], [11, "may meetings. 3 Button's receipts, and rob his day-book of its due. He was a saddler in Bridge Street, driving a brisk trade inherited from his sire, whose plodding main chance habits he had inherited also. April was a busy month with him, providing the racing com munity with his wares against the May meeting ; but that special first week in May was the slack one of the year, and furnished leisure for his marriage. Mrs. Wright had never trusted her head within \" that horrid Grange,\" since she left so abruptly after the Christmas festivities. Occasionally, during the long illness of Alice, Mr. Dutton and Miss Wright had walked thither on a Sunday afternoon, to inquire after her friend's health ; or the young tradesman mounted on a quiet pony had trotted down after busi ness hours, with messages and inquiries from his ladylove. But inside Grenville Grange Mrs. Wright vowed she would never step, \" to be frightened out of her wits\" \u2014 a very necessary precaution as the good lady was not the owner of many \"wits,\" and was bound to protect what little she thought she had. Shojokeepers' wives and daughters did not have a bevy of bridesmaids at their wreddings then, and if such matters were not always arranged \" decently and in order,'' they seldom or never spent on bridal display the income of a mouth or year. So Alice was invited to be sole bridesmaid ; and, with a view to conciliate b 2"], [12, "GOIj's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. 4 Mr. Ford, and astonish their own more humdrum friends, Mr. Heywood was solicited to act as grooms man. \u2022 At first he hesitated, was '\u25a0' likely to be in Paris at the time \" \u2014 \" might not have returned ;\" but about a week before the important event, the anticipated \"should be delighted\" arrived, and Mrs. Wright was in high glee. The morning came, bright and sunny ; the bride blushed and simpered, and feigned a confusion at the altar, but nevertheless pronounced the irrevocable \"I will,\" and promised to \"obey,\" without a thought beyond the importance the ceremony conferred on herself, and the dignity of becoming her own mis tress in a minute. She stepped into the church a child to be \"given away,\" she came thence a married woman, henceforth the head of a household of her own, but (though pretty fairly fitted for a domestic wife), with no thought, no conception, of the higher duties involved in that day's promise. Alice did not feel as unconcerned as the bride. Many jests and allusions to that coming future day. when she and the handsome groomsman would kneel together at the altar in the foremost place, not as mere glove-holders to others, had been made \u2014 too many to suffer her to be heedless had she felt inclined. Against her wish, though in fulfilment of a school-"], [13, "MAY meetixgs. 5 made promise, she was there, and to her the associ ation of Mr. Heywood with herself as groomsman gave a reality, a tangibility to their connection never felt so keenly before. They were paired together not merely by her father, but by strangers \u2014 not merely during the ceremony or in the chaise returning \u2014 not merely at the dinner table, but in the toasts which followed, and every fresh coupling of their names seemed another knot to bind her free will and tie her to a man she endured \u2014 only endured. Mr. Heywood accepted his position (and this maddened her) ; he accepted it gracefully ; she was his \u2014 he thought it, felt it, knew it (or seemed to do) ; he bent over her, led her to the harpsicord, indicated the songs he \" hoped she would sing ;\" claimed her hand for cotillon or minuet as something prized cer tainly, but still his own \u2014 something she had not the right to refuse, nor yet the inclination. But she did refuse, nevertheless, whensoever she possibly could ; and did it so calmly and composedly, her pleased father looking on saw nothing of the self-will, but only the fatigue of recent illness when she sat still, and only the desire to be generally agreeable when she danced with other of the guests. At such times Mr. Heywood would look into her eyes, as though misunderstanding her motives, and with an appealing glance second his request for \" the"], [14, "6 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. next dance, then ?\" or \" another charming song ? and so fluttered about her, that without any failure in his duty as groomsman, or loss of prestige as a beau and a gentleman, he contrived to stamp on their connection, the word \" betrothed \" in unmistakeable characters : and nothing but absolute self-assertive rudeness could have defeated him. And was not Alice envied her conquest ? Were there not disengaged ladies present who languished and flirted (with fans and follies) , all to attract the fasci nating beau whose graces Miss Ford seemed so little to appreciate, whose attentions she would so gladly have resigned ? But Mr. Heywood was proof against all arts, all blandishment ; he had left his business to come amongst comparative strangers to compliment no one, to oblige no one, but himself. He had come expressly to compromise Alice by appearing in public as her acknowledged and accepted lover, and so bind her to him by a bond which delicacy and honour would alike forbid her to break. To the best of her ability, Alice negatived his position. Obtuse busybodies wondered if she were really cold or only cunning, if she were holding him back, or urging him on ; and she, feeling the meshes of the web tightening around her, instead of wasting her strength in futile efforts to break through, con-"], [15, "MAY MEETINGS. 7 centrated her energies in her heart, and, as George had suggested, waited and watched, quietly destroy ing a loop here or there, but leaving the final result to a Power stronger and more clear-sighted than her own. People got drunk at weddings in the last century. I have heard of people occasionally doing so in this ; but then it was part and parcel of the business of the day, and the groom was often as drunk as his guests. No decorous tour or country trip carried the bridal pair out of sight or hearing ; and at a late hour loose jests would reach ears they should not. This was an old fashioned wedding, \u2014 a feast (not of reason or flow of soul) : dinner and tea and supper, solid and sub stantial meals, had followed one another, the bride had retired and the groom, the bride's garters had been contended for, the stocking had been thrown, the bride's-cake duly passed in minute por tions through the wedding-ring as a charm to invoke prophetic dreams to unwedded pillows, and the wedding was over. Alice had folded up one of the coveted morsels for Peggy, who had craved to be remembered, and stood with her mother ready to depart, long before Michael was willing to accompany them. In fact, he had taken more wine than was his wont, and had reached that point where elation would soon"], [16, "8 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. have passed into inebriety. Even sober, wary Mr. Heywood had a flush on his face and in his manner, whether from wine or success Alice could scarcely determine, but certainly something there was of freedom in his advances towards herself which she could only attribute to exhilaration under the juice of the grape. Michael had not \"set up his carriage.\" What visiting fell to the lot of his wife and daughter at Ford-brook was accomplished on foot or horseback ; and since their advent at the Grange there had been few friends to visit. The light dresses of the ladies created a demand for sedan-chairs, where homes were distant and beyond the sheltering Rows, but Michael had a contempt for a \" chair,\" so Dick had been ordered to bring the \"shandra,\" a sort of compromise between a modern van and a \"sociable.\" At all events it held under cover the entire party, who entered at the front, scrambling over the driver's seat to the cushions beyond, where they sat facing each other as in a modern omnibus. The shandra jolted a good deal, and Robert Hey wood made that an excuse for passing his arm round his companion's waist,\u2014\" to hold her on the seat,\" he said. Alice resented the familiarity, and strove to release herself, but he was neither obsequious nor"], [17, "MAY MEETINGS. 9 compliant that night, and held her fast in spite of her quiet repulses. . \" Alice does not like to be teased, Mr. Heywood !\" said Mrs. Ford deprecatingly, after a time, as the moonlight streaming in showed the discomfort of her daughter. \" I am conscious of that ; it is one of Miss Ford's great charms,\" responded the gentleman addressed, wilfully misunderstanding Mrs. Ford. \" I dislike the giggling girls who invite open remarks on their love affairs. Alice, I am proud to say, is just the reverse of this.\" And his clasp tightened with the strength of possession. \" Certainly, Mr. Heywood, but that is not what I mean. I think you are teasing her now.\" \"Surely not; this confounded shandra would jolt her forward into her father's lap did I not offer the support of my arm.\" \" I prefer sitting without any false support, Mr. Heywood,\" calmly said Alice, endeavouring to remove the offending member. \" And I would not permit it, Alice,\" was his decided answer, interrupted by the hasty remark from Michael, \" Well Robert, my boy, I suppose I shall have to dance at your wedding the next !\" \" I sincerely hope so, Mr. Ford ; and if our dear Alice would but consent to shorten my probation, she"], [18, "10 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. would crown the hopes of my life,\" responded the suitor, with an insinuating appeal in eye and voice to the maiden in his clasp. \" What do you say to that, Alice, lass ? When is the next wedding to come off?\" Alice trembled, not with fear, but strong desire to as sert her own right to think for herself ; and the effort to curb her will kept her silent. But Mr. Heywood was perverse that night, and so he bent his face close to hers and asked, \" When shall it be, dear Alice ?\" \" Never !\" rose to her lips, but George had coun selled caution and delay, rather than active opposition ; so she struggled against herself, and answered evasively. \"I did not think you were in such a hurry to part with me, father ! Mother is not, I am sure !\" \" Certainly, Michael ; Alice is right there ; she is quite young enough, and I should be very loth to part with her, even to Mr. Heywood.\" \" Neither do I want to part with the girl, Margaret ; Robert and I have settled all that. Much of his trade, as you know, lies in the neighbourhood, so he will make Chester and the Grange his head quarters, and if the family grows too large for the Grange, you and I, little mouse, will e'en trot back to Ford -brook when Brad well's lease expires ; so Alice need not keep Robert waiting on that account !\" So it had all been arranged without consulting her ;"], [19, "MAY MEETINGS. 11 her consent was unimportant ; she was only required to say when ! She was not prepared for this un seemly precipitation, and plainly said so ; insisting that, marriage was too serious a matter for a woman to enter upon lightly, or without due consideration. She was quite content to remain at home for some years; and if Mr. Heywood was the gentleman he professed to be, he would not take advantage of her father's preference to force hers, and that too with such indelicate haste. In her own room that night she asked herself if she had not implied a falsehood, and if she ought not at once to have said \" No !\" But conscience did not smite with a very heavy blow ; for she knew time to be the touchstone of truth ; and George had bade her gain time by any means short of actual encourage ment. She had done so. Open resistance would have precipitated a crisis she was afraid to contem plate, and that she had at least deferred. Down stairs the gentlemen shook hands and con gratulated themselves on the negative admission that she might be won in time. The result of their con versation was most promising. She did not object ! that was a point gained. She was very evidently coming round, and it would be as well to humour her. Women were all capricious, and a few months' court ship would not make her the worse wife."], [20, "12 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Mr. Latham's man, Tom, had passed Trinity Church as the wedding party were entering it, and with very officious zeal hastened homeward to com municate the fact that Miss Ford had been married that morning to the fine gentleman he had seen driving her about. George's strength was not very robust ; the colour left his face, and he leaned against a rail for support. Was Tom sure ? He had seen them going into church with Mr. and Mrs. Ford and a lot of folks ; that was all he knew ! Quite too much, from its effect on his young master, who strove to hide the gaping wound from the man's sight, as he reeled rather than walked to his mother's room. Then tie dropped into a chair powerless. \" My dear son, what can be the matter now ?\" \" Alice is married !\" \" Alice married ! I will not believe it ! Who is your informant ?\" \" Tom \u2014 he saw the wedding 1 \" My son, you are too impulsive ; and you do that dear, true girl an injustice. Alice could not be un faithful.\" And the good lady bent over her son and took his limp hand with a comforting touch. \" Ah, mother !\" and he sighed heavily. \" But she is a loving and obedient daughter, in the hands of two strong men, who will use her heart to break it. She must have been forced to this !\""], [21, "MAY MEETINGS. 13 \" But you are not sure. Tom may have seen a wedding, it is true, and Alice may have taken part in it, but Tom might not be able to distinguish between the hats of the bride and her bridesmaid ! Do not be so ready to meet a sorrow !\" Mrs. Latham cross-questioned Tom, and the result was as she suspected, a haziness in his impressions. But George was fearful of the worst ; so at his mother's suggestion he mounted a horse (for the first time since Christmas), holding the reins in his listless hands, and with Tom following at his heels, rode \u2014 not at an invalid's pace \u2014 to the church, and on feeing the clerk was permitted to examine the register. Sure enough, Tom was mistaken. There was Robert Heywood's name signed fairly enough, and in too close proximity to the dear name he loved, in a very ominous volume ; but she was not the bride, and all was fair again. So full of self-reproach was he for doubting his darling's truth and strength of will, that he had not one word of abuse for the busy groom who had given him such a heart-ache, and rode home rejoicing, to thank his mother for her better faith and clearer judgment. Ph\u0153be had been at the wedding to dress the bride, and share, in humble wise, the rejoicings ; and early next morning tripped over to the Grange, with a message from Alice. \"Miss Ford was going to the"], [22, "14 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. races with her father and Mr Heywood ; they would be somewhere on the Walls or the Roodee.\" Here was an opportunity for George ! He had lonsred to meet this man face to face, and denounce o him if he proved to be the rascal he suspected ; and here the very wedding which had caused him an afternoon's torture, furnished the means of communi cation between them, and brought him nearer his aim. The Roodee (or Roodeye) is the Chester race course, a tract of land long years ago, when Liverpool was a fishing hamlet and Chester a flourishing port, covered, at every full tide, by the flowing waters of the then swelling Deva. An \"eye\" or mound of earth in the centre, graced with a stone cross, alone held its head above water, as it held an image of the virgin (or holy-rood) buried beneath, and thus gave to the green meadow its uncommon name. It is needless to relate the longer legend, since it bears not on our story. Now, the waters of the Dee have re tired to a narrow sand-choked channel, and even in May, 1791, projects were afloat for removing the sand-bar, which threatened to destroy the commerce of the once important outlet. But the Roodee was unrivalled as a race-ground, not merely from the fit ness of its emerald surface in smoothness, size, or form, but from its proximity to the ancient Walls, and the accommodation they afforded to spectators. There"], [23, "MAY MEETINGS. 15 seats were provided, and ladies or others might pro menade or rest at will, the whole scene on the Roodee spread like a shifting panorama in their unobstructed view. It was a scene of interest to men with thouo-hts and feelings beyond horse-flesh and the stable. Two nationalities met there, as on a neutral ground ; two languages greeted the ear ; two costumes the eye. Yet this is open to contradiction. The frequent \" Dim Seisneg,\"* heard on all sides from Welsh lips in reply to casual questions from English tongues, certified the nationality of speech ; but it is question able if the motley group of garments clothing those English bodies could be claimed as \" national cos tume,\" when every freak of French fashion had its representative in male or female attire. Young bloods and \"spanking\" belles, dandies and dandizettes, lords and ladies, soldiers and civilians, grooms and jockeys, farmers and tradesmen, with their wives or daughters, gorgeous in the glory of scarlet cloth, gold lace, ribbons, velvet and brocade, or sober-suited in kersey, cloth, or camlet, made up the moving mass of people on Roodee or Wall ; but thickly sprinkled were seen the short linsey-wolsey petticoats, neat jackets, linen-caps, and high-crowned hats of Welshwomen, marking even more than the thick grey coats of their male com- * \" No English.\""], [24, "16 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. panions their claim to nationality, whilst they contri buted not a little to render the scene picturesque. Mr. Peover had been solicited by Michael to join Mr. Ford's party on the Walls ; but the old man had shrunk aghast from the proposal. What ! peril his soul by witnessing the abominations inseparable from a horse-race. No ! he had too many sins on his con science already, to add that to the number. Of all the works of the Devil, horse-racing was surely the worst, since all other deadly sins came in its train. No ! he was not going to follow the multitude to do evil. And if their friend Mr. Heywood was really desirous of an introduction, he, being the younger man, might find his way to God's Providence House. He might spend an hour or two there much more profitably than on the race-course. The excitable old man was unmistakeably affronted at an invitation which implied a belief in his proclivity to countenance wrong-doers : hence his testy refusal\u2014 a refusal which deferred his introduction to Miss Ford's cavalier to the chances of the future. The sturdy Cheshire yeoman had no such preju dices; from principle, he kept neither hunters nor racers himself, but he knew all the points of a good horse, and patronised racing as a noble British sport, calculated to develope and maintain the perfection of English horse-flesh. So he left Alice and Margaret"], [25, "17 MAY MEETINGS. on the Walls in the safe custody of- Robert Heywood, whilst he bustled down the steps and mingled amongst the heterogeneous multitude thronging the Roodee in the vicinity of the Grand Stand. Though a carriage or a \" trap \" was not then a natural concomitant of either wealth or competence, a horse-race was sure to bring together vehicles of all descriptions in considerable numbers, and to pick out an individual one amongst the moving mass would have required time, discernment, and a tolerable ac quaintance with the particular body on wheels. It may therefore be easily understood how Michael, meditating on the safest horse to back, failed to recog nise the Latham chariot, as the ponderous vehicle rolled in slow state past his very nose, and skirted the wall, whilst its occupants, or one of them, made an anxious survey of the mural spectators. Nor did he, jostling his way amongst diminutive jockeys who disputed his path, much as a drove of mules might intercept an elephant, as he now and then stopped to grip the hand of some fustian or buckskin-breeched, top-booted friend, ask himself if any of those vehicles brought nearer to his daughter the man he deemed his enemy and hers. But Robert Heywood's quicker sight (sharpened, perhaps, by jea lousy) discerned not only the chariot but those inside ; and, as the heavy vehicle was piloted to the VOL ill. c"], [26, "18 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. nearest steps, suggested to the younger lady in his charge the desirability of removing to a seat some two hundred yards away, which he averred com manded a better view of the course \u2014 rather a bold suggestion, considering the trifle of verity it involved. But Miss Ford's eyes were as sharp as his own, and her senses, and her will as strong, so she politely declined, and, though Mrs. Ford was disposed to be obligingly compliant, the daughter's decision pre vailed. Mr. Heywood shrugged his shoulders, bit his lips, and, for some few moments, seemed to hold a silent strife for mastery over some powerful emotion in his breast ; but \" Richard was himself again,\" and chatting very lightly and pleasantly with Mrs. Ford, when Madam Latham, with her velvet train over her arm, and accompanied by her son, advanced towards them gracefully, as Alice rose from her seat to welcome and salute her dear friends. The languor inseparable from protracted illness still hovered about George ; and the flush which mounted to his forehead, fading away, revealed how transparent and delicate his naturally white skin had become. Black hair once more rested in thick masses on his temples ; but all the clustering curls were gone. swept away by that ruthless scythe the razor, never more to return. The open sleeve, tied together at"], [27, "MAY MEETINGS. 19 intervals, and the sling not yet discarded, gave a clue to the source of an interesting delicacy, evidently not constitutional ; but health was apparently returning. and the sling retained for something'more than absolute necessity, since the young man readily withdrew the suspended arm to clasp the extended hand of Alice. Did Robert Heywood, in that crimson strip of silken netting, recognise the dainty handiwork of Alice, or recall her persistent silence when questioned what and wherefore her swift fingers wove, while yet the gliding silk chafed her too tender skin? Whatever Robert Heywood recognised, he stu diously avoided a betrayal of that recognition. He chose to ignore his perceptive knowledge of a rival, and even there assert his right to Alice ; so, with a cool audacity which confounded George, barely allowed their first greetings to pass before he interposed, and, with a graceful wave of the right hand, whilst the left as gracefully removed his jaunty triangular hat, said, addressing her, in a very bland voice, \" Friends of yours, Alice, I presume. Will you not favour me with an introduction ?\" The young girl so addressed as \" Alice,\" with a calm courage owing much to offended delicacy, replied, impressively yet quietly, \" It is not necessary, sir, nor is it desirable.\" \" Indeed ! I imagined, Alice, your friends should c 2"], [28, "20 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. be also mine. I am sorry, in this instance, to find myself mistaken.\" He bowed as he said this, and turned away, as if to hide the indignant chagrin of an offended lover \u2014 if, also, to avoid the keen scrutiny of the rival who yet retained possession of the coveted hand, no one knew but himself. Mrs. Ford's hasty exclamation, \"Oh, Alice, how can you be so rude?\" at once interrupted Mr. Hey wood, and elicited from her the somewhat sarcastic reply. \" Mother, Mr. Heywood's forgetfulness is a sufficient apology for mine ! \" and without another word she turned towards Madam Latham and George, with tones of more than friendliness, to resume the interrupted conversation. \"Mrs. Ford, Miss Ford is about to 3 oil me lu a stroll ; my mother will, I know, bear you company during our absence, and occupy the vacant seat,\" said George with studied composure, as Madam Latham seated herself, and Alice took the arm he offered. Mrs. Ford looked half frightened at this defection, and moody Mr. Heywood's glittering eyes glanced across the Roodee in eager search of another but very different pair, whilst he bit his nether lip until the blood started. \"Do not go away, Alice, your father will be so angry ! \" implored her mother."], [29, "MAY MEETINGS. 21 \"Miss Ford,\" interposed Mr. Heywood, under sanction of Mrs. Ford's remonstrance, \"your father entrusted you to my especial care. I am answerable to him for your safety ; may I entreat your stay ? \" \"My safety, sir, is in nowise endangered. I am responsible for my own movements, and release you from the honourable office of jailer,\" promptly an swered Alice, as she turned away indignantly, check ing with an imploring glance the angry words which rose to the lips of George. \" Hush, George,\" don't provoke a quarrel,\" whispered she, \"for my sake, don't ;\" and she led him rather than was led away. If the remembrance of his own weakness, the pub licity of the place, the surrounding groups of strangers, combined with Alice's beseeching tones to keep the impulsive young man's anger within the bounds of prudence, and sealed his lips, he had set no restraint upon his eyes, which through their angry flashes yet kept steady watch on Robert Heywood's face, puzzled even in their intense scrutiny. What was it chained Mr. Heywood's temper down, checked his speech, and daunted his effrontery, until the time was past and the offending pair lost to sight in the crowd ? Surely he had no fear of that pene trating blue eye, or the reviving strength of that long helpless arm ! The chariot stood close by the steps. George"], [30, "22 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. handed Alice in, and ordered the coachman to drive inside the city walls, not caring to come within range of Mr. Ford, and so risk his authoritative ter mination of an interview sure to be too brief, if it outspan the day. How much had to be told by both of love and faith, and patient endurance and impatient yearn ings ; of coercion and restraint on the one hand, and fruitless efforts to communicate on the other ; of advances so difficult to repulse, of the proposal for a speedy marriage, and dread lest the self-will of to day might counteract the diplomacy of the yester night ; of hopes, anxieties, and frequent relapses, de feating every attempt to be up and doing ? And how eagerly George expressed his intention to depart for Manchester as soon as he could use his right hand safely ; for there he felt assured lay the clue to the mystery connecting Mr. Heywood with his uncle Jeffery, and that once laid bare, he hoped to win his Alice even with her father's thanks ! How many plans were laid, how many aerial castles built, it boots not here to say ; but it must be told that George failed to identify Mr. Heywood with the scoundrel in his thoughts, and so he told her. There was a resemblance, he said, a marked resemblance, which made him uneasy ; but in what it consisted he could not well determine, though he could almost"], [31, "MAY MEETINGS. 23 define the points of difference. The form of his mouth, the hue of his eyelashes and brows, the warmth of his complexion, the large white teeth, all controverted suspicion ; yet he was not satisfied. He was only rendered more restlessly dissatisfied with the man, and more assured he was a subtle villain. \" Beware of him, my darling !\" said George ; \" he resembles so closely a rogue capable of any treachery, I fear to leave you within the sphere of. his machi nations. I tremble for all you may have yet to endure from his wiles and persecutions ; and shudder for fear your father, under his evil influence, should succeed in bending your will to his own.\" \" It cannot be, George ! If they carried me to the altar they could not force a syllable from my lips. If I cannot marry you, I will not marry him. They cannot compel me !\" \"Ah, my Alice, but priests have been found ere now willing to pronounce the nuptial benediction over a silent bride, and proclaim the ceremony complete despite the shrieking protest of a helpless woman !\" observed he with a sad shake of his head. \"You do my father injustice, George; prejudiced and obstinate he may be, but he loves me too well to sanction villany like that.\" \" We will hope so. But prejudice and obstinacy are both proverbially blind, and natures like Mr."], [32, "24 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Ford's are just those a villain warps easiest to his purposes. In the very love you deem a safeguard may lie your greatest danger ; for if, as I think, he urges this monstrous marriage from a conviction it will tend to your ultimate good, there is no saying to what lengths his two blind passions may be led.\" Alice, with eyes cast down, silently acquiesced in the truth of George's remarks, and after a pause, filled up as lovers fill such gaps, he resumed. \"It is impossible, dear Alice, I should endure the torture of absence and suspense much longer calmly \" \u2014 (Had he been calm hitherto ?) \u2014 \" some means must be devised for meeting or communicating at least. You are not debarred from wandering through the grounds, surely ? \" \" No, I walk there most fine afternoons, but seldom alone,\" answered Alice. \"No matter, I will watch the Griffin- gate from the plantation wicket every day until I depart, and we may perhaps obtain a glimpse of each other through the grating, even if speech be denied. But I hope our interviews may be many and unsuspected. You will be there, will you not, my darling ?\" Of course she would. Was not the separation as keenly felt by her as him ? and had she not more need of support under the persecutions she endured, even if in her bravery of heart she kept its soreness out of"], [33, "25 MAY MEETINGS. sight? Her willing promise obtained, George told her that behind the shield held by each stone griffin was a narrow aperture, hid by the pediment from passengers on foot, and only visible on very keen observation to horsemen travelling in certain direc tions. In the cleft behind the shield remote from Shotwick he would place his letters, and look for hers. Few persons save farming men passed that way, and it was as safe a place as he could find. She would have to climb a little on the gate, but he trusted she would not object to do that for his billets, since he had seen her mount on chairs and ladders in fitting up the Grange. Very willingly she acceded to all this ; but to his final proposition, that in case her father proceeded to compulsory measures, she would escape to him and become his wife at once, she was most resolute in denial. \" It cannot be, dear George ; my father would curse me in his anger, and I should never survive it. Do not press this subject again, I beseech you ; it is so difficult to deny when my heart pleads with you. If your errand to Manchester only furnishes weapons against Mr. Heywood, there will be no need of a secret marriage. Until that result is known, we must wait in patient hope, with firm faith in each other's constancy, and all may yet be well,\" was the"], [34, "26 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. reply of Alice ; firm, yet tender and consoling, as word and tone could make it. Yet George remained unsatisfied : he had hoped for a different reply, and somewhat reproachfully murmured, \"You cannot love me truly, Alice, if you refuse me this. Had I urged an immediate union, you might have denied me with some reason ; but when I ask you to become mine only in the last extremity, to escape a forced marriage with a man you detest, I think you might promise some thing more than ' faith ' and ' patience.' Unless I succeed and unmask this pretender, your father's obstinacy may wear out yours, and what becomes of ' patience ' then ? If your love possessed but a tithe the strength and devotion of mine, you would regard my proposal very differently, and not preach ' patience ' so calmly to a man whose heart is bursting with emotion, whose whole happiness depends on your reply.\" \" I have no gauge for your love or mine, dear George, but time,\" responded Alice, quietly, her tearful eyes telling how deeply she felt his ungene rous taunt ; \" and time which tries all, must prove which is the deepest and most enduring. Besides, what guarantee could you have for my love and duty as a wife, if I failed in affection and reverence for the father whose only hope I am. And if I am calm,"], [35, "MAY MEETINGS. 27 it is because I am sustained by a hopeful trust in Providence, not because I am insensible. Only prove to my father, beyond question, that Mr. Heywood has hoodwinked him, however slightly, and his own uprightness will prompt an atonement as ample as his prejudice. But mind, George, it must be proof, absolute proof; unsupported assertion he would only regard as malicious slander ; would not condescend to sift evidence against his valued friend, but treat the whole with contempt, and become only the more con firmed in his predilection. The war in my breast is not between love and duty, but between two loves, two duties. I need all my fortitude to do my duty unbiassed by the stronger affection, and more than my own clear-sightedness to discern which of my duties has the higher claim. Be generous, George, and do not tempt me beyond my strength ; impulse is seldom a safe guide, and unblessed marriages are mostly unhappy ones.\" \" You may be right, my dear Alice, but I feel too keenly to reason calmly; and perhaps have been too long my own master to form a correct notion of your position ; but I do know that the shallowest streams are noisiest, and ought not to have mistaken the calmness indicative of depth and strength of feeling for a proof of apathy. But you will pardon me, Alice, will you not?\" And he looked into her"], [36, "28 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. eyes, and drew her closer to him, with little doubt of her reply. There was a momentary lull, which Alice broke with a request to be driven back to her companions, saying that if her father were to return before she did, Madam Latham would be placed in an equivocal position, and though he was not likely to insult a lady, of her age especially, yet angry men were as uncertain as drunken ones, and she should be sorry to expose George's mother to slight or rudeness on her account. Touched by her consideration for his mother, George acquiesced, though every fibre of his being jarred discordantly as he reflected to whose care he must surrender the treasure of his heart, how remote was the prospect of another such meeting, and how pitiless a storm the present interview would draw on the dear head he was unable to protect. His clasp of hand and waist tightened as the chariot neared the steps; he pressed the taper-fingers to his lips, and only lowered them when the carriage stopped and the door was opened. Then that strange power of self-command we all feel in public places, or the presence of strangers, enabled both to stifle their emotion, and passers by saw only a lady handed carefully from a carriage by a gentleman, and led courteously up the steep steps or along the Wall as dozens of others were."], [37, "MAY MEETINGS. 29 Mr. Ford luckily had not left the Grand Stand. Madam Latham and Mrs. Ford were occupied in reminiscent conversation ; and Mr. Heywood, looking at his watch with wicked eyes, bit his lips and con tracted his white forehead until his eyebrows met. A race was on ; eager heads were bent forward to see if red or yellow, blue or pink, would win or lose ; eager voices shouted, \" Now Sir Watkin ! \u2014 -now Sir Watkin !\" as the Welsh favourite darted past, but those wicked eyes glanced covertly from the course along the route trod by Miss Ford and Mr. Latham. He saw them first, and rose at once, the sinister light in his eye deepening, as he stepped forward to relieve George of his charge, and conduct Alice to her seat. Declining his proffered aid, she resumed her place and apologised to Madam Latham and her mother for her prolonged absence, regardless of the frowning face behind. But her ear caught words not meant for her, and fear chilled her heart like an icy hand. \" Miss Ford may be able to answer for her conduct to Mr. Ford ; I hope you may be as able and ready to answer to me for yours !\" were the haughty words of Robert Heywood, in tones so muffled and disguised she scarcely knew them. But the clear accents of George were unmistakeable. \"I fail to recognise the right of any man to control my actions or free will : but I am always at home to"], [38, "30 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. a gentleman \" (with a marked emphasis on the word). \" When I am assured that you are a gentleman, I will meet you as a gentleman should. If rny right arm is crippled, my left is steady and true, and will not fail me.\" \" There, sir, you have me at disadvantage ; but this additional insult cannot pass. You will hear from me when I can meet a man and not a cripple !\" was Mr. Heywood's sneering rejoinder. George bowed his assent ; but Alice caught his arm, and entreated him in a whisper to be cautious for her sake. Mr. Heywood, she said, was a practised shot ; she had seen him bring down pears and apples from the trees at Ford-brook without damage to fruit or tree, his bullets cutting the stalks in two as though with a knife. \" If he did, Alice, you need not fear for me. I only knew one man who could do that ; and though neither voice nor complexion warrants the assertion, something tells me Mr. Heywood is that man. He will not find it convenient to proceed with this quarrel, and I am hopeful now!\" whispered George, assur ingly, ere he shook hands with her and Mrs. Ford and departed with his mother."], [39, "ON THE WATCH. 31 CHAPTER II. ON THE WATCH. Michael did not rejoin his family until the close of the last race, when he came disposed to be in a good humour with everybody and everything, having betted, although no gambler, and won from gamblers by profession. But long before the evening closed his good humour took flight. Mr. Heywood, too clever to turn informer himself, contrived so to lead, wrest, and twist the conversation as to wring from Mrs. Ford's unsuspicious lips the story of the after noon ; and Alice's long absence with Mr. Latham. And then what a storm burst over the devoted heads of Alice and Margaret, to the utter dismay of the latter. But the intrepid girl stood boldly forth her mother's champion, and averred that blame, if blame there were, attached to no one but herself. Still she"], [40, "32 god's providence house. contended she did no more than her father would have done in her place, and at her age, and asserted her right to think for herself where her whole future was involved. George she defended against the asper sions heaped upon him, and maintained he was a man of unsullied honour, incapable of a base or mean action. Mr. Heywood had left the room, as if to avoid an altercation most painful to his sensitive feelings ; and shortly after, Mrs. Ford retired, weeping, pale, and trembling from excessive trepidation. Alice main tained her ground, supported by a consciousness that she was right, with a calm dignity of manner as far removed from boldness as timidity, though her heart beat tumultuously the while, and her father's threats that he would put an end to such nonsense and make her marry Robert before the summer was over, drove her sick and faint with a new terror. A loud scream from Mrs. Ford, and a fall down the stairs, abruptly terminated the angry conference. Father and daughter rushed alike from the room in haste and fear, and found Margaret stretched in sensible on the tiled pavement at the bottom of the staircase. The noise had alarmed the domestics, who came in a body from supper in the kitchen, and im mediately after Mr. Heywood ran down the staircase from his own room, in his shirt-sleeves and stocking-"], [41, "ON THE WATCH. 33 feet, and with a napkin in his wet hands. He apolo gised afterwards for the disorder of his attire, on the ground that he was washing, and was too greatly alarmed to think of his appearance \u2014 and who could contradict him ? All Michael's anger vanished in his deep concern for his dearly loved wife '; he lifted her in his strong arms like an infant, and bore her to the sofa in the long room in an agony of dread, Peggy following, wringing her hands and dolefully protesting \" she knowed summat 'ud happen to Missus before th' month wur out when she see'd her looking at the new moon through that very staircase winder ; it wur so unlucky.\" Regardless of these ejaculations, Mr. Ford chafed his wife's hands and feet, whilst Alice and Peggy with vinegar and burnt feathers strove to restore consciousness, but she lay as one dead, and Michael's conscience smote him for the harsh woids he had bestowed on the gentle being not has an hour before. Dick was at once hurried off for Mr. Prestbury, or any surgeon he could find at home ; and the faithful fellow not stopping to saddle a horse, rode off at a stiff gallop on a bare-backed steed with no rein save the halter. Long before their messenger had gained the crowded city, faint moans from Margaret gave signs of return- VOL. III. n"], [42, "34 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. ing animation, and previously to his return with Mr. Prestbury, she had recovered sufficiently to relate in broken and detached sentences the cause of her fall. Ascending the stairs slowly with her head bent, she became aware of another light before her than the candle in her hand, and looking up involuntarily to see who might be coming down, beheld at the bend of the staircase beneath the window, where the dim rays of the hall-lamp could not penetrate, the apparition of her cousin attired in the grey sacque she wore in life. She was supernatu rally tall, cadaverous, and ghastly, as from decomposition ; her skirt was stained with a line of blood, black as her lips ; and from the gaping wound in her breast streamed a pale blue light, in which all this was horribly distinct and visible. Stupid with terror and amazement, she had stood appalled, too terrified to stir or utter a sound, as the spectre slowly advanced towards her. It came almost within arm's length, when she suddenly lost her footing and her recollection. Here was a fresh source of disquietude for Michael, or rather the old one confirmed and strengthened. Hitherto the ghost had only appeared to himself, and ignorant servants or rustics to whom a white sheet over a mop or broom would have been equally signi ficant and terrific. But now, that his quiet inoffensive wife was practised on (he would not admit the ghost was"], [43, "35 ON THE WATCH. supernatural) the case became serious and desperate. Besides the bodily injuries she had sustained in the fall, pronounced by Mr. Prestbury neither few nor light, was the greater shock to the mental faculties. Face to face she had met the mysterious visitant, and recognised her dead cousin in its unearthly aspect, to haunt her memory through life. From the opinion thus openly avowed there was no retraction : the alarm spread, and a nameless terror held over the Grange a hideous pall. Even Mr. Heywood, \"who usually affected to despise the story of the haunted chambers seemed affected by the general gloom, and departed in a few days for Manchester, as if glad to escape the ominous pre cincts. How much the daily visits of Sir. Prestbury had to do with his sudden decision was not declared ; but it is certain Mr. Heywood kept beyond range of the surgeon's penetrating vision during the time he did stay. Previously to his departure Michael had himself decided and agreed, that, willing or unwilling, Alice should be Robert's wife before the year was many months older ; and as soon as Mrs. Ford was better, and able to move about, preparations should be set on foot \u2014 women were always so long-winded over such trifles, and could not get married without dresses and linen to last a lifetime. He would rather the d 2"], [44, "36 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. girl should be persuaded than compelled ; but she was too young to know what was best for her, and older heads must settle the question. And, in accordance with his theory, it was settled by Robert Heywood and himself, without consulting the young lady for whose future they were providing so very much better than she could herself have done. Margaret was too sore and shaken to leave her bed ; she complained of pain in her left hip, but the doctors both (for the puffy physician was consulted) pronounced the limb whole, and attributed the pain to bruises only. The care of the household devolved therefore on Alice, and, coupled with attendance on her mother, furnished her with an excellent excuse for avoiding her assiduous suitor's society. At the same time he watched her movements so narrowly, that she found it impossible to get out into the grounds without his escort ; and while she painfully resigned herself to a confinement not to be avoided, she inly lamented the disappointment of George ; whilst he, under less restraint, impatiently wore a path, by pacing to and fro, amongst the underwood fronting the gate, whence he could observe, himself screened by the thick-set hedge. Mr. Ford bore his esteemed friend company as far as Chester ; and as their horse's hoof-tracks died away Alice, freed from restraint, hastened with light"], [45, "ON THE WATCH. 37 step to the Griffin Gate. Being morning, George was not on his post, but ensconced behind the friendly shield was a very loving billet. She replaced this with one from her own pen, and hurried back to con its contents in privacy and security. Day by day she contrived, at one hour or another, to ramble as far as the gate, and always found awaiting her either George himself or his paper representative. At the last of these sweet stolen interviews he announced his departure the following day for Manchester, and kissing passionately the hand she extended through the grating, bade her keep up her spirits, love him and trust him until his return, which would not be until he had mastered the secret of Mr. Heywood's connection with his uncle Jeffery. It was a bright June morning when George Latham, with the blessing of his mother on himself and on his journey, mounted his chestnut mare and rode away full of hope and vigorous health. Every trace of sickness was gone ; sword or pistol would have been alike to him then had any \" gentleman \" insisted on \" satisfaction ;\" but the challenger had not thought proper to repeat his demand, and George only re membered it from the link it had furnished to the chain he thought he was forging for Mr. Heywood. He called at God's Providence House on his way, but dropped no hint of his destination or his errand."], [46, "38 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Simply saying he was going a journey, and might be away some weeks, when he hoped to have news for them, he bade the good old pair an affectionate \"good-bye,\" and received their hearty \" God speed !\" in return. Long as he had contemplated this expedition, his projects and plans were yet crude and undigested ; but his long and solitary ride shook his somewhat confused ideas into order, and he became aware that his first step must be to discover the identity of Caldwell and Heywood with any genuine Manchester firm, a fact he was inclined to doubt, since he had pored over a local map, yet failed to discover Meal Street. But he would plod the town from end to end, street by street, before he abandoned the search ; and once found, let Robert Heywood tremble if he had ought to disguise ! The afternoon was far advanced when he entered the High Street, Northwich, and dismounted at the Crown Inn, with the intention of remaining until morning. He had barely seated himself when he was followed by a gentleman of middle age and frank aspect, who proceeded to give his orders with the ease of an old traveller, to whom every inn is a home. Something there was in the manner the servants one by one came into the room and eyed the new-comer, which arrested the attention of Mr. Latham. The"], [47, "39 ON THE WATCH. traveller himself took no notice of this scrutiny, but there was a sly twinkle in the corner of his eye indicative of a humorous appreciation of the attention. Presently in bustled the chamber-maid, primed for some important duty, and with little ceremony and less courtesy accosted the stranger. \" Mr. Newton, I'll trouble you to tell us what you did with the sheets off your bed last Christmas Fair ?\" \" Indeed ! You would like to know, would you ?\" was the coolly-provoking reply. \" Yes, that I would. I searched high and low for them sheets, and had to make them good out of my own pocket after all.\" \" In-deed ! A heavy loss that, Mary ! Have you lit a fire in that room since Christmas ? If I re member rightly a fire was greatly needed ; the cham ber smelt like a mouldy cheese.\" \" It's no right to smell mowldy ; fires are kindled often enough in all the rooms, I'm sure an' sartain ! But I want to know what you did with them sheets ? \u2014 they were good dowlas, and cost more than a poor servant lass can afford to lose,\" retorted the damsel of beds and bolsters, in a very aggrieved accent. \"In-deed!\" dryly repeated Mr. Newton. \"Per haps you would oblige me by lighting a fire in the grate now. I know the room is at liberty.\""], [48, "40 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. \" A fire in June ! who ever heard of such a thing ? I dare say you'd like your bed warmed too !\" quoth she, as scornfully as she dared. \"Indeed I should; it is most desirable,\" calmly asserted the gentleman as he ate his cutlet. \" But light the fire, without delay, by all means.\" \" But what of the missing sheets, sir ? Am I to be at the loss ?\" \" I will answer your question when the fire is alight, not before. I am in no hurry, if you are not.\" George listened to this dialogue with a growing conviction that the traveller had a tendency to lunacy ; but his low chuckle when the woman flounced out of the room reassured him, and suggested that he was merely jocular. In less than ten minutes thin wreaths of wood smoke came curling in at the open doorway, there was a slamming of doors, and angry voices demanding if the landlord meant to stifle them, mingled with anxious inquiries if the house was on fire, all of which seemed to cause Mr. Newton considerable merriment, as he coughed and laughed by turns. The smoke continued to pour in, to the amusement of the stranger, and the annoyance of every one else. Presently the chambermaid returned, her face red with temper, and black with soot. \"The fire will not light, sir; either the wood o"], [49, "ON THE WATCH. 41 the coal is bewitched ; nothing will make it burn, and all our customers are leaving through the smoke, and I've wasted all this time for nothing,\" grumbled she, in much displeasure. \" Perhaps the chimney is bewitched, and not the wood or the coals. I should send for a sweep to mount the flue, and clear the way for the smoke, if I were you,\" suggested Mr. Newton, quietly. Away the woman went to the landlady ; the advice was taken (for Mr. Newton was an old customer), and a sweep procured, after some trouble, since the town held but one, and he eked out a living in other ways, chimney-sweeping in country places being per formed mostly by amateurs. A holly-bush, perchance, or a live goose, suspended by a rope attached to its feet, dragged up and down by some person mounted aloft on the roof, doing duty for the climbing boy and his brush. Firing a gun upwards, or firing the chimney, were equally ready methods of removing the superincumbent soot much in vogue. The sweep was, however, found ; and lo ! from the offending flue he brought the missing sheets to light, black and grimy, from their dark closet. Amazed, the puzzled mistress of the linen-press came back once more, the smuttied sheets in her hands, as if for some explanation or reason. She had it very shortly."], [50, "42 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. \" I found the sheets on my bed last Christmas not merely damp, but wet, and placed them in the chim ney, to be aired when next you warmed the room. Not having attempted the latter, my forethought has been useless. Perhaps, Mary, you will save me the trouble of airing my sheets in future.\" Out of the room walked Mary, crest-fallen and dis concerted, caught in a trap of her own setting ; and Mr. Newton, turning to George, acquainted him that, in the course of the thirty years he had been a bag man on the road, he had made it a rule to place the looking-glass between the sheets, as a damp detector, whilst he undressed. The slightest mist on the glass was warning sufficient ; off came the sheets, up the chimney they went, and he slipped his limbs between the blankets. He had cured more than one chamber maid of sprinkling once-used sheets, and pressing them smooth, to kill the next comer. Further conversation followed, in the course of which it transpired that Mr. Newton was a Man chester small-ware manufacturer, or, as he called him self, \" a beggar's-inkle weaver ;\" and first for his father, and then for himself, had been on the road more than thirty years. He was free and easy, without vul garity ; and his open, ingenuous manner won George's confidence ; whilst, it may be told, he was equally impressed with Mr. Latham, having contrasted him"], [51, "ON THE WATCH. 43 very favourably with the class of forward young men he was in the habit of meeting in commercial rooms. They sat and chatted some little time, when the elder gentleman, finding George was a stranger, pro posed a stroll. He could look in on some of his cus tomers, and show Mr. Latham the town at the same time, he said. George assented willingly ; a lurking desire to see the birthplace of Alice, before the day light faded, quickening his feet. \" Could the landlord point the way to Fordbrook farm?\" was George's question. \"Aye, blindfold!\" was the host's reply. \" They must take the third turning to the right, and follow their noses, till they came to a stream running right across the road. The nighest house was the farm, a straggling whitewashed building in a nook of the road.\" Mr. Newton had no customers in that direction ; but he bore the young man company notwithstanding, and George scanned the place with a lover's eye for the picturesque, as if to print it on his memory. He conjured up the form of Alice, living and breathing there, wondered which window marked her old room, and, for the sake of her, with two or three silver pennies, bribed a boy, swinging on the gate, to clamber up the porch and gather him a bunch of unblown rosebuds and jessamine leaves. A lover's subtle rea soning typified in those fair young buds, half hid by"], [52, "44 GOD'S PROVIDENCE nOUSE. the dark jessamine\u2014 his sweet Alice, with the tender petals of her heart folded up and closed from obser vation, amid gloomy associations and unsympathising friends at the Grange, until light, sunshine, and warmth should develope their tender loveliness, and awaken their latent perfume. He carried his prize lightly in his hand, not caring to reveal to a stranger the motive for his visit, or the sentiment connected with the blossoms ; and Mr. Newton, with a delicacy not common to bagmen, forbore any remark on the subject, although his own discernment suggested that a j oung man would not come out of his way to look at a solitary farm-house, nor carry a memento away, without a stronger motive than curiosity. From his new acquaintance George obtained much information, of after service in the prosecution of his search ; and, when they parted at the door of the inn next morning, Mr. Newton reiterated his desire to see Mr. Latham at his home in Broom Street, which he hoped to regain in a week or ten days. Tall warehouses now rise where the Bridgewater Arms, Manchester, then stood, in High Street, near its junction with Fountain Street and Market Street Lane, the latter a confined, ill-paved, ill-lighted tho roughfare, so narrow in places that two carts could not pass, and pedestrians on the footway were fain to"], [53, "45 ON THE WATCH. step into doorways to escape contact with muddy wheels, rolling by. A semicircular row of wooden posts, from which a line of chains depended, railed off an ample space in front of the spacious new inn for the exclusive use of visitors, their horses, or ve hicles. Since the day when George Latham hesitated between the White Bear, in Piccadilly, and the Bridge water Arms (both commended by Mr. Newton), finally drawing rein at the latter \u2014 since the sunny day when he threw his bridle to the nearest ostler, and mounted the steps of the hotel, Time has trod the lofty pile to dust, built up warehouses on its site, burnt down the busy marts to build them up again \u2014 once more applied the torch, once more plied hammer and trowel, and built stronger and higher palaces for the Trade-king, to endure until he wears them out, or hurls them down. The handsome George Latham who entered the Bridgewater bore little resemblance to the tottering old man in spectacles and a scratch-wig and snuffy garb of antiquated cut, whose waistcoat courted his knees, and whose cuffs and skirts were ample to ab surdity. He who needed a stick to support his steps, and walked with one hand on his bent, rheumatic back ; his wandering eyes glancing nervously around him as he passed from High Street, across Market Street Lane, into Fountain Street, aud turning into"], [54, "god's providence house. 46 the first opening on his left, entered \"Meal Street, which ran and still runs parallel with Market Street. There was a Directory of Manchester and Salford at the Hotel, but it had been published ten years ; and Mrs. Elizabeth Raffald,the compiler, took no note of Messrs. Caldwell and Heywood's long-established firm. Caldwells were there and Heywoods in plenty ; and it was just possible that Mr. Heywood, being to all appearance not more than thirty, might not have been a partner when the old lady published her useful shilling volume of reference, the pioneer to so many others. Mr. Latham, however, had a theory of his own on the subject \u2014 he believed the firm to be purely fictitious ; but the old man who, putting on the name of Jacob Hunt along with his wig and coat, walked slowly and painfully along the narrow street, and peered through his tortoiseshell-mounted spectacles at the houses or warehouses on either hand, with their worn-out signs, made a discovery which upset that theory. Manchester warehouses had not then attained the palatial size and splendour displayed in this our day and generation. They were mostly red brick build ings, for use, not ornament, and more conspicuous for ugliness than aught besides. Great trades were carried on, and fortunes made in nooks and corners, and the cellar warerooms, now resigned to fent-dealers,"], [55, "ON THE WATCH. 47 waste-dealers, or country manufacturers, had a dif ferent class of occupants then. Still the generality of large firms held corresponding premises ; and when Jacob Hunt read \" Caldwell and Heywood\" on the lintel of a closed door to one of these basement ware houses, he, a stranger to the town and its peculiarities, judged it a token of anything but extensive trade. Taking no note of his discovery, he dragged his limbs to the end of the street, thence turned at right angles into Rook Street, and having explored that locality also, returned at the same slow pace. There were few warehouses in Meal Street, one side consisted of houses alone, tenanted mostly by small tradesmen, too proud to be journeymen, too poor almost to be masters ; and at the door of one of these (by some strange coincidence facing the mercers' closed warehouse) the aged man stopped. A sign over the door, and a bill in the window, together supplied the information that J. Warren, tailor, had lodgings to dispose of. J. Warren, tailor, was a pompous, little ignoramus, whose clever wife atoned by her activity of mind and body for the brain he lacked, holding together a busi ness he would have lost, had she not been chief superintendent. Thrusting the atom of a man aside, lest his self-importance should for the twentieth time drive away a candidate for her room, she ushered"], [56, "48 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Mr. Hunt into her own parlour, and dusted with her apron a chair for him to sit down. According to his own statement, Jacob Hunt was a student deep in the mysteries of some abstruse science, and wanted a room where he could study in quiet, undisturbed by the noise and bustle of a main street. He should need a bed, in case his studies might occasionally engross him until a late hour ; otherwise he required a sitting room only. A front room on the first floor, serving as \"bed room, and parlour, and all,\" was shown to the snuffy old man, and for this he chaffered with Mrs. Warren over the price. He did not seem at all too eager to complete his bargain, yet in the end agreed to her terms, and paid a month in advance. One by one he objected to the articles of furniture, his objections ending in a propo sition to send in his own easy-chair and a new look ing glass ; which caused the good woman later in the day to remark, in confidence, to her spouse : \" Who'd ha' thought that old fellow, with one foot in the grave, had so much vanity !\" That night a large swing-glass and a huge padded arm-chair with projecting sides were sent, together with a heavy parcel of books for Mr. Hunt, and next morning the old man took possession of his room and gave his dietary orders with so thorough a reli-"], [57, "49 ON THE WATCH. ance on his landlady's better judgment, as convinced her he was \" not such a fool after all.\" The easy-chair had been drawn near the window, and also a table, ostensibly for his books ; but no sooner had the tailor's wife left the room, than Mr. Hunt straightened his bent back, stepped lightly over the floor, turned the key in the lock, and then placed his swing-glass on the table, in such a position as to reveal to the occupant of the easy-chair all that passed on the opposite side of the street, himself screened from observation. Day after day passed by, and over the polished surface of the looking glass passed shadows many and varied ; men, women, and children, carts, and waggons \u2014 all the traffic of a back street in the heart DO of a manufacturing town, but no shape of man or boy lifting the trap or unlocking the closed door owned by Caldwell and Heywood. The watcher, grew weary and fidgetty, but the very mystery of the unopened door made him more eager in his watch, more assured there was something wrong to ferret out. It was his wont to sit, book in hand, alternately glancing at the volume (a novel, not a scientific tome) and the reflector before him until dusk, when he vacated his apartment and returned to the Bridge water Arms, carefully locking his door behind him. The second week of this fruitless watch had almost E VOL. III."], [58, "50 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. expired, when it occurred to him that his very taci turnity might have shut him out from a knowledge of his neighbours, so he gradually changed his tactics, stopped to speak to his pompous landlord as he, going in or out, passed the open door, where the tailor sat cross-legged on his board at work. On one of these occasions he observed, casually as it were, that he supposed the place opposite was to let, or else the tenants did little business, the door was always closed ; and was informed with a .multitude of grand words and much prolixity of expression, that the place was not to let ; but the occupiers appeared to transact their business in a singular fashion and at uncommon hours, seldom commencing until other houses were closed for the night. Until then, George Latham had indemnified him self in the evening for the weary hours spent by Mr. Jacob Hunt in his padded chair, with no better com panions than troubled thoughts, or Richardson, Sterne, and Smollet, by visiting such places of amusement as were then open to the public of Manchester. The courtesy of his new friend, Mr. Newton, had supplied him with \" stranger's orders,\" admitting to those somewhat exclusive places, the Assembly Rooms in Mosley Street, and the Gentlemen's Concert Hall, then in Fountain Street. But the Theatre Royal, in Spring Gardens (newly built on the site of the first,"], [59, "ON THE WATCH. 51 burnt down) was his favourite resort. His mind was oppressed, his days were spent in wearisome mo notony ; but the impersonations of Siddons and Kemble drew him away from himself, and lessened the weight of his anxieties for the time being at least. But he had another motive in seeking amuse ment at such places. He calculated that, as a fashion able beau, Mr. Heywood would most likely frequent them ; and if any connexion existed between him and his dissipated uncle Jeffery, they might possibly be found together. So he scanned the audiences nar rowly for the faces he longed to find, and ever with the same result. Mr. Warren's scrap of information changed his tactics ; the daily watch was relaxed (not at once, so as to excite suspicion, but in a day or two, when the conversation would be forgotten), and Mr. Hunt began to study far into the night. Little did the good people of the house suspect the nature of his studies, or that long after his candle was extinguished he sat by the window looking out into the street. The oil-lamps which lit the thoroughfares of our largest towns shed at best a greasy glare rather than a clear light, and being few and far between, even the principal streets were not too well illuminated.

It so happened that one of these was suspended high over head, at the apex formed by the junction of three iron bars projecting at right angles from the wall, within a yard or two of Cardwell and Heywood's ware house, and cast a dim light on the trap and sign. The second night after Mr. Hunt's new course of study commenced \u2014 soon after the sleepy old watch man, with stick, rattle, and horn lantern, had gone by, droning out \" Past ten o'clock, and a dark, heavy night\" \u2014 two men emerged from the darkness in the direction of Rook Street, and stopped at the long watched door. The one (who carried a heavy pack) was a big dark man, a stranger to George ; but as the light of the lamp fell full on the other, he re cognised with a shudder the bad face of his bad uncle, Jeffery Latham ! The steps leading down to cellar warehouses of this type extended far across the footpath (where there was one ; but Meal Street could not boast a flagged footway), and were generally, as in this case, covered with broad trapdoors, shut down after day light or business hours ; and woe betide the luckless wayfarer through the ill-lighted streets (or unlighted, as the case might be, the recent Lighting and Watch ing Act being scarcely in full operation) if negligence left these yawning pitfalls uncovered at ni^ht."], [61, "53 ON THE WATCH. Unsuspicious of the searching eyes in the dark ened room opposite, Jeffery Latham lifted the trap, descended the steps, and drawing a key from one breeches pocket, deliberately unlocked the door. From the other he then drew something, \u2014 what, George could not distinguish, the rays of the oil lamp not penetrating to the depths below the surface\u2014 but whatever it was, he lit a match with a celerity which, to the anxious spectator (unac quainted with any chemical means of obtaining light, familiar only with the tinder-box and its con comitants), savoured strongly of witchcraft. How ever, a lamp lying close at hand within the doorway was almost as speedily lit, his burthened companion followed down the steps, and the door closed upon the two. The windows, partially sunk beneath the level of the road, were covered with outside wooden trap-shutters, so that nothing more was visible to the spectator. Other men came, tapped at the door peculiarly, and were at once admitted ; some of these were laden with bundles and bales, but no Robert Heywood was of the party. Towards midnight the men dispersed, one or two at a time ; Jeffery Latham being the last to depart. The light of the lamp fell fully upon his face as he emerged from the steps, and his nephew recognised it beyond doubt or question."], [62, "54 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Jacob Hunt had studied to some purpose that night ; the first problem was solved ! The next morning was Sunday, and George Latham, with a lighter heart than he had felt for some time, sat down in his room at the Bridgewater to commu nicate to his mother his assurance of the connection between Jeffery Latham and Robert Heywood ; thus establishing his identity with the enigmatical letter. He was full of sanguine hopes : the one discovery assured him of all ; and on that basis he built so many cloud-palaces, that Madam Latham, when the letter reached her hands some days later, shook her head and sighed."], [63, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 55 CHAPTER III. THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. j After the noontide meal Mr. Latham, attired as became his age and position, strolled down Market Street Lane to post his letter, and afterwards pay his promised visit to Mr. Newton. Instead of returning to High Street, as the less circuitous route, having leisure, and being desirous to see more of the town, he sauntered quietly along the shady side of the way to avoid the heat of the June sun, surveying the old market-cross and pillory, the black and white buildings in old Millgate, and pausing to examine the old church and its grotesque corbels as he passed through the graveyard, then a thoroughfare. Thence up Fennel Street, through Withy Grove and Shude Hill, to the street he sought, Broom Street, easily known by the posts and chains"], [64, "56 god's providence house. Avhich barred the passage at either end from the common traffic of public vehicles. The only place of business in the quiet street (whose very bricks and mortar have been scattered like ashes in the whirlwind of improvement) was a large warehouse extending to the corner of Shude Hill. With the house attached, it occupied fully half one side of the street, and its purpose was indicated by the unsightly black doors, rising one above another, with a strong teagle at the top one, to hoist up bags or bales to the successive floors. George noted this only as it interfered with the private appearance of the vicinity, then retired and genteel, containing the homes of many respectable manufacturers ; but had he known the secrets shut within its walls, he would not have passed the out of-place building so indifferently, or stepped across to Mr. Newton's door so lightly over the \"petrified kid neys \" with which the street was paved on each raised side of the central gutter. He unconsciously read the tarnished signboard, it is true, but it bore the name of a man who had died or disappeared years before, and though his widow or wife had married again, the sign was not removed, and the name of the first spouse was of as little importance to George as to the fat woman behind the parlour curtain Avho"], [65, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 57 watched him cross the street, and \" wondered who that was at Newton's door.\" Mr. Newton was at home, as also Mrs. Newton and a bevy of beautiful girls, their daughters, varying in age and characteristics, from the romp of eight or nine to the sedate and sensible woman of eight-and -twenty. A very favourable report must have preceded Mr. Latham, who was welcomed by the whole family as one whose visit had been looked for and expected; and notwithstanding the formality attending even family intercourse at that period, he was soon on a very friendly footing with them all, especially the youngest, who chattered to him confidentially and made him the depository of a budget of childhood's gossip. But her elder sisters sang and played and chatted very vivaciously with their new guest also, much to the discomfiture of a couple of red-coated cousins and a young builder (jocosely greeted by one damsel as \" old paper-cap \") who entered after he did, and eyed him with considerable suspicion and disfavour. They were fascinating girls ; and but that the fair face of Alice ever rose before him and shut out other female charmers, he might have lost his heart that day \u2014 and his life to boot \u2014 for one of the young officers, a lieutenant of \"the 10th\" looked remark ably fierce and belligerent on the occasion. Mr. and Mrs. .Newton, with much old-fashioned"], [66, "58 god's providence house. hospitality, pressed Mr. Latham to leave the Bridge water and make their house his home during his stay in the town ; but that George respectfully declined, on the plea that he had important and urgent busi ness on hand of a peculiar nature, which lay in the immediate neighbourhood of the inn. He promised nevertheless to repeat his visit the following Sunday ; or earlier, if the completion of his business permitted his return home before that date. Very curious the young ladies were as to the pecu liar business which detained in one spot a young gentleman not professing either law, physic, or di vinity ; not claimed by army, navy, or commerce ; and every art short of the direct question was exercised to worm his secret from him. George was not by nature an adept at concealment, but the last eight months had done something towards teaching him caution, and putting impulsiveness into a strait waistcoat, as is sometimes needful ; so he evaded their roundabout queries, and at an early hour returned to the Bridgewater, accompanied by Mr. Newton, leaving the redcoats and \" paper-cap\" behind to recover lost ground and lost tempers at leisure. To Mr. Newton he was not so reserved. A mutual good feeling had sprung up between the two, notwith standing the wide difference between them in a\u00b0-e and pursuits. To him he confided the fact that he"], [67, "the griffin betrays its trust. 59 had come on a secret errand, the aim of which was to unmask a villain, and rescue from his toils a young girl beloved by himself; but what the name of that villain, or the species of villany suspected, he kept to himself with more prudence than his wont. And Mr. Newton, with a laughing caution not to let any of his daughters into his secrets, if he wished them preserved, and an offer of his services or advice in any emergency, departed, almost as curious about Mr. Latham's affairs as were the younger members of his family. Another week's watching ! Mr. Hunt was on the alert, and studied more assiduously than ever ! Cardwell and Heywood's warehouse was opened in the day-time. The Old Quay Company's waggons brought or carted away large packages of various shapes and dimensions, and business was certainly brisk, judging from appearances. The premises were closed when other warehouses closed, and Jeffery Latham invariably carried away the key. \" Our opposite neighbours have resumed business, I perceive,\" said the old gentleman, querulously, as he passed the open door of Mr. Warren's tailoring apartment on the Tuesday evening. \" I shall have to find quieter lodgings if those infernal carts keep up such a devil of a racket ! I wish they lay at the bottom of the Red Sea alongside Pharaoh's"], [68, "god's providence house. 60 chariot, that I do\u2014 I might be able then to read in peace !\" \"I regret exceedingly \" began the startled knight of the thimble. \" Which of those rascals is Mr. Cardwell, I should like to know?\" interrupted his testy lodger, Avith some asperity, as if greatly aggrieved by the sudden bustle and commotion which had awakened the neighbourhood into life and activity. \" Which, I say, is Mr. Cardwell r\" \" Oh, that gentleman by the door now, sir, is Mr. Cardwell, sir,\" pointing with his needle, as he spoke, to Jeffery Latham. \" The elderly gentleman with black eyes, and hair neither black nor grey, sir.

But I frequently observe to Mrs. Warren, the old gentleman is breaking very fast. He has changed remarkably since Christmas, sir. We think he had some great trouble then. Business-men often have heavy losses, sir, and we thought \u2014 you know people cannot avoid thinking, sir \u2014 we thought his dashing, dandy partner might be cutting his coat without measuring the cloth, sir !\" \" Humph ! then his partner's a rantipolling blade,"], [69, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 61 is he!\" growled Jacob Hunt, after listening to the pompous yet loquacious stitcher. \" But its no busi ness of mine ; shouldn't care if they were both knocked on the head, so that they didn't disturb me.\" And muttering all the Avay, he went up stairs and locked himself in, whilst his landlord resumed his work, and mui-rnured, \"What a savage old bear that, is!\" Savage, indeed ! and with good cause ; and in the muttered wish there was more of earnest truth than the hearer dreamed. But Jacob Hunt was in his chair, book in hand and glass in view, and before the sun reached its meridian another shadow crossed the polished plate. Robert Heywood, jaunty and trim, on a steed as sleek as his rider! The black, heavy-browed man, always busy about, touched his hat, with a glance peculiar from a porter to his employer, and held the horse whilst the traveller dismounted. Mr. Cardwell met the new arrival at the door, and without shaking hands the two disappeared together. A stout, vulgar-looking woman, richly but showily attired, with powdered wig, large fan, and enormous hoop, visited the warehouse next. She was evidently a purchaser, and an important one, from the defer ence paid by both partners, as they brought pieces of goods to the light of door or window, and bowed her"], [70, "62 god's providence house. out on her departure after a long interview. More than once during the week she returned, attended the second time by a cringing little man, over whom she seemed to domineer as only a little-minded, vulgar, uneducated wife could. He was certainly her husband. But, who was she ? A question not to be answered by sitting in an easy-chair and watch ing a glass. Other customers they had, apparently of the shop keeper class; but Jacob Hunt observed that these men glanced round them furtively, as if ashamed or afraid to be seen, before placing a foot on the steps, and hurried away on their re-appearance from the depths as if dreading pursuit. But the fat, vulgar woman, came and went boldly, as any fair-dealing tradeswoman might. Although door and shutters were locked and barred at the usual hour, late at night they were opened again ; the partners came, shut themselves in, and were followed at intervals by other men, who rapped the same peculiar rap on the door and were at once admitted. Provided with an ear-trumpet, the anxious watcher raised the window sash and listened for word or sign that should betray the secret of these meet ings. The people however came and went in silence, but he learned to imitate the tap upon the door, and once caught the words \" Rook Street Chapel.\""], [71, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 63 Mr. Jacob Hunt became a devout Catholic, attend ing mass with most praiseworthy regularity ; but never without the very essential ear-trumpet, which he raised during the service, and dropped as\" he mingled with the crowd in coining out, \u2014 \" With lingering slop and slow \u2014 \" a feeble, decrepit old man. The aural instrument, pendent from his neck by a ribbon, proclaimed his one infirmity, the stick and bent back another, the green spectacles a third ; and he wound his painful way amongst the groups of people, pitied by some, unheeded by others. Amongst these were Robert Heywood or Jeffery Latham (never both together), and two or three foreign-looking individuals, who stopped at times to exchange a word or two with each other in their native tongue, or with the Irish members of the community, and, as a matter of course, the deaf old man was not supposed to hear. Once Robert Hey wood darted a quick glance at Jacob Hunt, but apparently satisfied, he resumed his conversation, which, however, was low and not very intelligible to uninitiated ears, being in French, and mingled with cant phrases. At the end of the second week George again wrote to his mother, hopeful and sanguine still, but com-"], [72, "64 god's providence house. plaining of the slow progress he made, and that, with heightened suspicions, he had obtained no positive proof to justify an open accusation of his rival. The following post, a few days later, told another story. He believed he was on the track of a con spiracy, in which Robert Heywood was involved. But his uncle's letter remained obscure as ever. Accustomed to fresh air and early hours, the con finement during the long hours of day and night to a close room, in a narrow street, combined with the anxieties attendant on his dreary task, had caused him to look worn and jaded ; and the Misses Newton, when he paid his second Sunday visit, rallied him not a little on his altered appearance, which they attri buted to unrequited love. The father, with more experience, came nearer in his guesses ; and having a conviction his young friend was not succeeding in his secret undertaking, carried him off for an evening walk out of the way of their banter. As the door closed behind them, one on the oppo site side was opened to admit a portly gentleman of middle age \u2014 opened too by Cardwell and Heywood's fat female customer. \" Who is that ?\" asked George, nervously. \" That \u2014 oh \u2014 Mr. Gradon, our deputy - constable ; he is a constant visitor there,\" was Mr. Newton's care less reply."], [73, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 65 \" No, no. I mean the lady. Who is she ?\" \" She \u2014 oh \u2014 she is Mrs. Snow, the occupier of that house and warehouse. A wholesale dealer in rags, old iron, and other commodities not so easily de fined. But, my dear young friend, what is there about Mrs. Snow to agitate you so greatly ? Had she been a charming damsel of sweet seventeen I could understand your varying countenance, but she is neither young nor loveable, and I plead guilty to curiosity,\" continued Mr. Newton, leading away George, whose surprise had rooted him to the spot, as it were. This then was the missing link in the chain ; the clue so long wanting ! George was bewildered ; it had come upon him so suddenly \u2014 so unsought ! He soon recovered. \"Mr. Newton,\" said he then, \"you have given me an essential item of information ; and had I but con sulted you a week ago, much anxiety might have been avoided. But you were a comparative stranger to me ; and I am suffering so much from another person's heedless confidence in a stranger, I may be pardoned for a caution which is very newly born in me, I assure you.\" \"Make no apology, young gentleman, for the exercise of prudence. I have lost thousands through the want of it in my dealings with others, strangers especially.\" And the speaker sighed as he spoke. VOL. III. F"], [74, "66 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. \" If you will come with me to my inn, Mr. Newton, I will show you a letter which came into my posses sion strangely, and which I have preserved, conscious it had reference to a mystery I am striving to in vestigate. A word you dropped just now inclines me to think you can throw a light on what is dark to me,\" said George, as they walked along ; adding, after a pause for deliberation, \" I believe I may trust you with my secret mission, Mr. Newton, but this is a matter which concerns men's lives, and as I have little more than strong mental conviction and sus picious circumstances to guide my search for positive proof, great circumspection is requisite.\" \"Any rogue may protest his trustworthiness, Mr. Latham, and grey hairs are no guarantee for good faith, so I will not waste breath in asserting mine,\" gravely replied the elder gentleman. \" Tell me nothing more than is required to render my experience available, or ensure a correct judgment, before I venture to advise ; but reserve all further confidence until you know me better. As a native of the town, mixing with all classes of people, my experience may serve you in good stead.\" \" So I am convinced !\" answered George readily ; hastily adding the inquiry, \"Are you on friendly terms with your neighbour, Mrs. Snow ?\" \" Thank Heaven, no !\" emphatically ejaculated the"], [75, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 67 other. \" My little daughter, Nelly, and Mary, her daughter, are schoolfellows and playmates, I am sorry to say ; but it is much against our inclination, and there all intercourse ends. The children are fond of each other, and we cannot put a stop to the intimacy without making an enemy of the mother, who is equally undesirable as friend or foe. Besides the poor child is not answerable for the misdeeds of her parent.\" \" You have relieved my mind of a difficulty, and now I will give you as clear a view of my case as I can.\" George then briefly and succinctly acquainted J\\lr. Newton with his early attachment, the feud between the Lathams and Grenvilles, dating many generations back, and renewed in the person of his uncle Jeffery, whose iniquities he detailed. He told how Mr. Ford, won over by plausible manners and a rescue from robbers in the sorest, insisted on his daughter's union with Mr. Heywood. Of his own suspicion that Mr. Heywood and his uncle were in league, and Heywood only the alias of a great scoundrel. That confronted with him he had failed to establish the identity of the two ; and as nothing short of actual proof of the man's baseness would satisfy Mr. Ford, he had come to seek out in disguise corroborative testimony. He told also of the murderous attack upon himself, F 2"], [76, "68 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. and the suspicions it engendered. Of his observa tions in the guise of Jacob Hunt, and his failure to affix positively to Robert Heywood the offences he believed him to have perpetrated. Of the supposed incipient conspiracy he said no thing then, but produced the letter referred to when they reached the inn, looking over Mr. Newton's shoulder as he read, with a running commentary of his own on its contents. \" The letter bears no date, you observe, Mr. Newton, but the postmark does \u2014 'Manchester, Oct. 1779.' Well, that goes to prove in the first line that this is a secret correspondence, and that a covert meaning lies under it all.\" ' Snow has fallen ' \" (reading from the letter). \" Was there snow in Manchester in October ? There was none in our neighbourhood.\" \" Not a flake, my good friend ; but take the con text, ' Snow has fallen and the dust is laid. Old iron in demand ; marketable at a premium.' You don't happen to have a thieves' dictionary in your pos session, I suppose ?\" drily put in Mr. Newton, looking up in George's wondering face. \" A thieves' dictionary !\" repeated George ; \" for what purpose ?\" \" Oh, only to translate this letter by. Old iron is a cant term for stolen property, and Mrs. Snow is more than suspected to be a wholesale dealer in"], [77, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 69 that rusty metal. To interpret thus \u2014 Mrs. Snow laid the dust \u2014 id est, money \u2014 for her particular class of wares, and made a bid for ' old iron,' not then in stock. In other words, I should say you were on the track of a nest of robbers, Mrs. Snow beinc recei ver-general.\" \" If I were only sure of that, I would give both scoundrels in custody at once, even though the one is my own uncle !\" exclaimed George impulsively. \" Would you, indeed ?\" coolly drawled out Mr. Newton. \" And I would not. Have you so soon forgotten that Mrs. Snow is on the best of terms with Mr. Gradon, our deputy-constable ? You must have incontrovertible evidence of special guilt and com plicity, too flagrant to be hushed up, or you will fail, and Mrs. Snow is not a woman to be trifled with, as you shall hear when we have finished the letter.

Meanwhile I will set a watch on my neighbour, and in a ease of emergency, have a search warrant issued the first robbery that occurs. Harrop and Wheeler, the pro prietors of our two newspapers, are both friends of mine ; they would be glad of the news, and if the 'suspicious case' were only to appear in both the ' Mercury ' and ' Chronicle,' it would shake Mr. Ford's faith in his friend, I imagine.

Then pray be wary, and no doubt you will succeed ; but I promised some account of Mrs. Snow. Wealthy as she is now, she once trudged through the streets with a basket, picking up rags, bones, and other refuse.. She married a man named Wrigley, who had a donkey-cart, and, together, they peregrinated the streets selling sand and rubbing stones, or exchanging them for rags, bones, broken glass, or metal. And if a little old iron slipped under the sand occasionally, who was the wiser ? The rag and bone trade prospered ; they opened a cellar in Tib Street which she managed whilst her husband pursued his calling in the streets. From the cellar they emerged into a shop, and there she formed a connec tion with the man Snow, her present husband. After that she and Wrigley had frequent quarrels, but they patched them up somehow, and on one of these occasions, soon after they came into Broom Street, they went off to Liverpool together. She came back alone, however : said he had been ' pressed ;' but it came out afterwards, the crimps had got him, and at her instigation he had been kidnapped and shipped off as a slave to the West India plantations. Don't look shocked ; this was years ago, and though such"], [80, "72 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. doings are not extinct yet, then they were common enough, and in some places the authorities winked at them. In a few months she professed to have news of his death, and without the ceremony of mourning, went through the ceremony of marriage with Snow, and made a tool of him ever after. It is said he has twisted a halter for himself, and that she drives him with the rope's end. Be that as it may, he is little better than a lackey, and, when Mr. G radon visits her, has his meals in the kitchen, whilst they feast in the parlour, with a show of plate on the board, not often fpund on a commoner's table. It seems Snow de serted a young woman who claimed to be his wife, and had three children by him, and she came one day, and mobbed the house, demanded her husband, and called Mrs. Snow very foul names. For this the poor creature was cited before the ecclesiastical court, and, as she could not produce her 'marriage lines,' and Mrs. Snow could, she was stripped of everything she possessed, and turned with her three children into the streets to starve. That is the instance of Mrs. Snow's vindictiveness I alluded to ; a fact well known to all the neighbourhood. I told you, her daughter, and mine were playmates. More than once Nelly has come home with accounts of carboys of vitriol or other chemicals hid in the back yard, under heaps of bones or lead \u2014 of copperas, stowed away under heaps"], [81, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 73 of rags, discovered by them in their play, but from a knowledge of which Mary Snow shrank affrighted. \" Her mother would kill them, if she thought they knew of it,\" she said. Very recently the child was taken ill, and as she lay in bed, her constant cry was for Nelly Newton. So Mrs. Snow's servant (a queer old woman), came with a very civil request that Nelly might be permitted to go there for a day or two. With some reluctance, my wife \u2014 who is afraid of making an enemy of the woman \u2014 consented ; but Nelly would not remain a second night, though Mary implored her. It appears that in the middle of the night, Nelly, who is a light sleeper, was awakened by the entrance of some one into the room. The cur tains at the foot of the bed were only partially drawn, and, through the opening, she saw Mrs. Snow, with a dark lantern in one hand and a basket in the other. Lifting a bunch of keys hanging by her side, she selected one, and opened a large wardrobe fronting the bed. It was hung round with watches, and the shelves were loaded with plate and jewellery. She took several watches from the basket, and a necklace, which sparkled in the light as she hung it up amongst others. After double locking the door, she turned to leave the room, but, suddenly bethinking herself, came back, and flashed the light on the faces of the sleepers. Fortunately Nelly had suf-"], [82, "74 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. ficient presence of mind to keep her eyes closed, but she slept no more that night, and frequently went to the door on tiptoe to listen to sounds of quarrelling down stairs. Once she heard the old servant saying angrily, as she crossed the hall \u2014 \" I tell ye what, I don't like that wench of Newton's being here, she's too 'cute by half, and if she's been awake, she's seen enough to hang us all ! I'd kill the brat, if I was sure of it!\" Nelly crept back to bed ; but came home next day, and never went again, until her little playmate was about. But fear has sealed her lips, and Mrs. Snow thinks her secret safe. I only knew it this week \" \" Why did you not give information at once T asked George promptly. \" It would have been useless : a secret messenger would have been there before the public one, and the wardrobe have held a woman's garments only. And we should have got into hot water for no good pur pose,\" answered Mr. Newton. \" I should rejoice, neverthelesss, to see the vile old woman trapped, and will lend a helping hand at the right time with sincere good will.\" George Latham shook his head. He had listened with attention to Mr. Newton's narrative, but could not coincide with his policy. \"I should have de nounced the woman years ago,\" he said. \" No waiting"], [83, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 75 to let bad fruit ripen, to the detriment of good, for me!\" \" Stop, stop, my young friend. In my case, you would have done as I have done. I travel much, often with large sums of money about me. I leave a wife and daughters unprotected at home. Neither house, warehouse, money, nor life would be safe from her friends did I bring Mrs. Snow into trouble, and ruin her trade ;\" and so saying, Mr. Newton rose to go home, as it was late, and the inn closing for the night. Next day, Jacob Hunt repaired to his lodgings once more, and, being warm, opened bis window to listen as well as watch. Mr. Cardwell was still atten tive to his duties, opened the warehouse, received customers, and held nightly meetings as before, but the spruce Mr. Heywood came no more, either to business or to mass. In a few -days the deaf man heard that Robert Heywood had gone abroad ; but as signs partly supplied the place of words between the talkers, he obtained but a faint inkling of his errand. At the end of the week the warehouse closed altogether, even the mysterious taps on the door at night ceased, and Mr. Hunt, engaging his apartment for a longer term, left \" for a summer ex cursion to the seaside,\" at which Mrs. Warren rejoiced greatly, as he had paid for the unoccupied room, and she got her money for nothing."], [84, "76 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Before returning home, George Latham acquainted Mr. Newton that a plot was hatching in the Meal Street warehouse, to create dissatisfaction amongst the populace, and disseminate principles correspond ing with those rife in France. That the confederacy was in its infancy, Robert Heywood its head, and he had gone abroad, for some purpose connected there with. Also, that the meetings would not be held for a week or two, when he (George Latham) would come back to Manchester, communicate with the authorities; and by the aid of the signal he had learned, furnish them at once with the means to detect and secure the plotters. Mr. Newton, much amazed, pledged himself to secrecy, and commended the young man for his pru dence in learning to \" bide his time,\" instead of rush ing headlong into danger to no purpose. Madam Latham received her son with open arms, thankful he had returned in safety. She knew his temperament, the risk he ran from his own impe tuosity, and, during the month he had been away, her prayers for his preservation had been frequent and fervent. His first inquiry was for Alice. She had not been there ; Mrs. Ford was still an invalid ; her hip had been injured by the fall downstairs more than was at first suspected, and she was likely to be lame for life,"], [85, "THE GRIFFIN BETRAYS ITS TRUST. 77 even when restored to health. This was cheerless news for George, who had become attached to the amiable little mother of his darling, in the short time she spent at the Lodge. But worse news followed. Preparations were making at the Grange for the wedding of Alice, and, though she herself persisted in remaining inactive, they went on all the same. Mrs. Peover had spent a day at the Grange, and another at the Lodge, and from her Madam Latham had learned this. Mrs. Peover had said that Alice looked pale and thin, as if worn out with contending emotions, but that her reliance on Providence remained firm and unshaken. \" God bless the dear, dear girl !\" said George, when he heard all. \" She is worthy any man's love. I wonder if she goes down to the gate still.\" \"Yes,\" replied his mother. \" I sent Ph\u0153be down several times during your absence ; and, no later than yesterday, she told Miss Ford you were expected home.\" Had it been March instead of July, George could not have rushed through the plantation more hur riedly, in expectation of exchanging a word of love and hope with Alice ; but though he lingered until dusk, no Alice came, and he was fain to content him self with placing in the griffin's charge a packet pre pared at the Bridgewater Arms, containing all he"], [86, "78 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. knew of Mr. Heywood, and his connection with Jeffery Latham and Mrs. Snow. He desired her to make no use of that unless circumstances compelled her in self-defence, as he hoped, when he returned to Manchester, to overthrow all Mr. Heywood's projects. He had long had a suspicion concerning his rival's identity with the man who insulted her in Watergate Street ; but that needed confirmation \u2014 the likeness was strong, but not complete. It was a long letter, written at intervals, in which he poured out his whole heart and soul to her. Loving words and encourao-ino passages were there, and hopeful projects for the future. Little did he dream when he penned that impor tant document, with all its impassioned interlinea tions, of the hands into which it would fall. But the griffin betrayed its trust, and revealed the somewhat bulky package to a horseman, coming, oddly enough, down the unfrequented road on that side the gate. He smiled with strange significance as he read the superscription, and placing the packet in a secret pocket for security, rang the bell, and was at once admitted."], [87, "GONE ! 79 CHAPTER IV.

The constant irrita tion occasioned by the ghost's frequent and uncertain appearance, the repeated refusal of servants to work or sleep within the dwelling, combined their in fluences, with his daughter's open objection to the husband he had chosen, and helped to produce this undesirable change. Betty and Sally both threatened to leave at Mar tinmas, and Peggy was only prevented from following their example by her love \u2014 love for the girl who had grown to womanhood under her eye \u2014 for the master and mistress she had served so long \u2014 and lastly, but by no means least, love for her inflexible sweetheart, Dick, who laughed her superstitious fears to scorn, having neither fear nor superstition himself.

Yet she was content \u2014 their position was perfectly natural, and she found no fault with it.

His wife's accident was a sad blow to Michael ; and, as she persisted in asserting it was her cousin's spirit she saw, he began to entertain the idea of abandoning the Grange. But, oh, how loth was he to acknowledge defeat! He had come there boldly determined to root out the mystery, and restore to the property its ancient value, if not its state. On the land he had succeeded, due allowance being made for his short possession and its waste condition ; but the house itself, though no longer a ruin, remained a dread and terror to all around. Feeling himself beaten at one point (though he would not own it, even to himself), he became only more stern and inflexible on his other project. \" He had promised Alice to Robert, and he would keep his word : nothing should induce him to break it \u2014 nothing !\" And so, as Mrs. Peover had said, preparations for the wedding went on, as though Alice had been per fectly acquiescent, with the one important exception, that she lent no aid of hand or head to the work. It was in vain that she demurred, or persisted she would vol. in. G"], [90, "82 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. not marry Mr. Heywood ; her father, equally peremp tory, insisted she should ; so at length she ceased to oppose, her will remaining unsubdued nevertheless. They were to be married in August. A solicitor was instructed to draw up a deed of settlement, con veying the house and its surroundings to Alice on her marriage ; and containing a clause, wherein Mr. Ford agreed to erect a fresh dwelling in the grounds, if two years' trial proved the Grange untenable. Alice refused to go to Mrs. Hopley, so Mrs. Hopley was brought to Alice, to measure the young lady for bridal attire, and a general outfit, seeing that she herself would neither spin, knit, nor sew for the occasion. She felt that to prepare for the wedding would be to admit its possibility ; and she had ceased to do that since the scene with her father after their return from the races, after her open interview with George Latham. She was an affectionate daughter, constant in her attendance on her mother, for whom she felt a grow ing anxiety. She loved her father ; and remembering how kind and indulgent he was before Mr. Heywood came amongst them, grieved to think it was not in her power to comply with his will, without a sacrifice both of herself and the man she loved. George had whispered hope ; but he had not returned, nor had she heard from him. In vain did she daily go down"], [91, "GONE ! 83 to the gates of her prison (for does not a barred door, with restricted intercourse, make a prison of a palace ?),' he was not there. The griffins had no news for her' though he had been gone a month ; and July had come to mock her with its sunshine. Surely he had not failed ! Ph\u0153be, for some reason of her own, had not de livered Madam Latham's messages to Miss Ford; had not seen her, in fact. So poor Alice had to fight her battle alone, unsupported by even a word or message from her lover. She was even denied the poor consolation of a passing greeting with the kind old lady in the church aisle, Michael (inspirited by his evil genius Robert) having driven her over to Chester Cathedral to prevent such a contingency. Very thin and pale she grew under this restriction, and very sad. Sadder as the weeks went by; and though her eyes were tearless, their lustre grew dim. She had little leisure, and less solitude, for indulgence in melancholy musings ; but the effort made by pride to disguise the misery eating into her young life only increased her mental pain. Sadder grew her heart, paler grew her face, since that sunny summer day when Dick, hat in hand, held the bridle for Mr. Heywood to dismount, with as much deference as though the new-comer had been a prince of the blood-royal.

Sadder still, when her father, annoyed that she did not come to welcome his favourite when summoned, ushered him into her private sitting-room as one who was privileged to enter. But sadness changed to indignation when the in truder, advancing rapidly, caught her in his arms, and held her in a close embrace regardless of her struggles, or the angry flush upon her face, when his lips rested on her burning cheek. Only long enough to assert and maintain his right to claim her, and allay the passionate longings of his own heart, did Mr. Heywood hold her thus ; for he did love her, albeit bis love was fierce and ruthless. \" Mr. Heywood, this is ungentlemanlike, un generous ! \" was the only reply she made to the \" My dear Alice,\" which accompanied this unexpected embrace. \" Nay, Alice, it is you who are ungenerous ; surely I do not claim too much after my long and devoted service ! \" \" Long, sir ! Years of devotion, not months, would not have warranted such indignity !\" replied she, with flashing eyes. \" Only an accepted lover would claim a right like that !\" \"Miss Ford,\" said he, bitterly, \"I will not affect"], [93, "gone! 85 to misunderstand you.

Do not presume to malign in my hearing one whose worth j-ou cannot estimate.\" \" You are right, Miss Ford, we cannot reckon the value of a cipher,\" was the sneering reply. \" I do not attempt therefore to estimate my rival's worth ; his worthlessness might be summed up by any one in terested in the items or the product. But pardon me, dear Alice,\" continued he, in an altered voice (checking her as she was about to speak), a look of deep concern passing over his face (but not into the depths of his triumphant eyes), \" pardon me the pain I have unintentionally caused you. Nothing but the anguish of your indignant repulse would have wrung from me an accusatory word against my successful rival. All along, common sense has sealed my lips.

Not that she doubted George for an instant, but the pang which shot through her heart on hearing him aspersed went deeper than she knew. Robert Heywood had taken both her hands in his, looking down on her bent head, as his appeal became at once remonstrant and apologetic. But she neither removed her hands nor spoke ; she stood in a dreamy maze, asking herself if those tones of sincerity, those unstudied words, could issue from false lips ? Had he slandered George in the rage of jealousy, or with deliberation ? Surely there was no trace of premedita tion in that reply, which had varied in tone with the changing mood of the speaker? (Ah, Alice, there are men who are ever on their guard, who deliberate as they speak !) Had he gained an advantage? He thought he"], [95, "GONE ! 87 had, and remained silent for a moment, leaving the yeast to ferment ! But her hesitation was soon over, she withdrew her hands, and would have passed him, to leave the room, had he not barred the passage with his arm. \" Not yet, Alice, do not leave me until you have pronounced my forgiveness ? \" implored he earnestly. \" When you retract the slander you indulged in, I may forgive, not before,\" answered she with dignity. \"I cannot retract a truth, my Alice.\" (Why did she wince ?) \" I can only promise not to repeat the offence.

I have no girl-fancies to forget. Love in my heart is deep and strong, and not placed, as you would intimate, on a worthless object. That is my mother's bell ; pray, do not detain me !\" and she glided from the room as she spoke, leaving him to set his teeth and scowl when she was gone. Roads in July are dusty, and Robert Heywood's habiliments bore traces of his ride, so it became that trim gentleman to change his garments ere the"], [96, "88 god's providence house. dinner-bell rang. Once in his own room his whole demeanour changed. Rage and disappointment swayed his breast alternately with ungovernable love. \" Oh, Alice ! \" he murmured, half audibly, \" beautiful mistress of my fate, would I could win thy heart as easily as thy hand ! But wait, proud woman !\" and he ground his teeth \u2014 \" wait until I have you fast \u2014 mine \u2014 mine own ! and every word of scorn or insult I have borne shall be repaid three fold, if love last not too long.\" His hand struck against George's packet in draw ing off his coat. It was opened, read, and read again, whilst evil lights and shadows flitted across the reader's face. \" So !\" mused he, \" Mr. Smoothtongue has played the spy. Is on my track !

A spray of jessamine and a rosebud had fallen from the packet. Mr. Heywood calmly appropriated them, as he folded the letter and placed it in the bureau long since devoted to his use. \"Lie there, tell-tale,\" said he, with a grim smile, \" the answer will not be forthcoming to-day. Watch the gate, my fine fellow, if you will ; watch till your eyes are sore : but I can watch as well as Jacob Hunt, and to better purpose. I trust no secrets to a gap in a stone carving. Not I ! Who wins when the knave is pitted against the fool ? Ah, Miss Alice, my game is sure now !\" That afternoon Mr. Heywood had important busi ness letters to write ; but, before he retired to his own room for the purpose, he contrived to hint that the garden required immediate attention close to the Griffin-gate, a hint Mr. Ford was not slow to take. What was the name Robert Heywood signed to his first letter ? Not George Latham, surely ? Yes, George Latham ! But close as was the resemblance between the two hands,' the signature was practised over and over again before the evil eye was satisfied, and the quill traced the two words beneath the letter. Was not that something like forgery, Mr. Heywood ?"], [98, "90 god's providence house. Ah, well, Mr. Heywood was not particular ; and the game was in his own hands \u2014 or he thought so. Mr. Heywood had a number of letters to post. Mr. Ford offered to send Dick to Chester with them, an offer courteously declined, on the ground that its acceptance would infringe a rule of the firm, never to intrust their letters to any messenger, however trustworthy, except the public one. Another proof to Michael of the prudence and exactness of the business man ! As he left the drawing-room, where Margaret lay on the sofa once assigned to her daughter, he pre sented to Alice the rosebuds and jessamine, whis pering tenderly \u2014 \"The last time I passed through Northwich my feet strayed to Fordbrook, to the place where I first met you, my Alice ; where I lost my heart, never to regain it. I thought this me mento of your old home and birthplace might not be unacceptable even from my hands !\" Alice took the withered leaves and thanked him ere he went, thinking no worse of the giver for the delicate attention. Ah, had she but known ! \" Where was George ? Why did he not return ? How leisurely that man drew his scythe through the grass near the gate ! When did her father's mowers loiter like that ?

But that mattered little, since George had not been kept waiting. Had he been there she would have found a letter. No, he must be still away ! Could anything have happened to him? God forbid ! Mr. Heywood said he was \" fooling her ;\" the very words her father had used months ago ! Surely she could not be deceived in her idol. He was true ; she knew he was ! It would be treason to doubt him. But why had he not come or sent ? Oh, why? Thank goodness, Luke had finished his day's work at last ! Oh, dear, dear, there was Mr. Heywood ringing at the bell. When should she get to the gate ?\" And poor Alice turned from the window with a very heavy sigh, her impatient soliloquy cut short by the arrival of Mr. Heywood, and Mrs. Ford's desire that tea might be \" brewed \" at once. Through the open window came the even song of birds in the branches, the twittering of a colony of swallows in the ivy, and the perfume of sweet flowers, to overpower the hissing of the urn, or the fragrance of the Chinese leaf. But Alice's heart was out of tune, and there was no other of the party with a care for such things. The evening passed ' as many others had done latterly. Michael watching his patient wife, and thinking more of her than of birds"], [100, "92 god's providence house. and \"flowers; talking of her, and the harvest, and the coming wedding, between his cups of tea; whilst Robert Heywood, in unusual spirits, chatted plea santly with all, watching Alice the while never theless. Oh, what a weary evening that was to her. The tea-board gone, Michael and Robert importuned for music, and the girl's fingers went over the keys of the harpsichord with little consciousness of the airs she played. But Michael carried off Robert, before the daylight had quite gone, to show a new dairy and press-room he was building apart from the house, so as to surrender the others to the uses of his son-in law ; and Alice, barely waiting to snatch an old straw hat from its peg in the corner, ran rather than walked to the great gate. Why on this day was she more anxious than on wearisome days before ? Was it that suspense grew burdensome, or had the artful' hints of Robert Hey wood aroused suspicion in spite of her better judg ment ? There ivas a letter nestling in the nook ! He had come home, and she was happy ! Close to her bosom went the precious billet, close to the treasured locket ; but she must watch her opportunity to read.

Could this be the George so dear to her ? Could his hand have penned that insulting scrawl ? Surely not ! But the seal, the writing, the signature, the peculiar folding of the paper, all, all assured her it was his; what would she not have given for the power to think otherwise ? What ! did he consider her sense of pro priety less than Madam Latham's ?

What have I done to warrant such a proposal ? Have I shown duplicity towards him that he should think me capable of tampering with the ale or the clocks? How painfully unlike the George of my early love ! Can there possibly be any foundation for Mr. Heywood's cruel words? Can these ' four charming girls' have been the cause of his long absence ?

I cannot believe him fickle, cannot believe him worthless ; but, oh, this letter, this coarse, insulting letter, comes to fill my heart with doubt and dread !\" She sat down by the table, clasping her hands, and swaying to and fro, tearless in her sharp sorrow. There is no grief like that which rises before a shattered idol. Better the loved one die than prove unworthy. But pride, insulted modesty, and indignation came to her aid. Brushing back from her forehead the hair which had fallen from its bonds during her agitated movements, she sat down to her little desk (long kept in her bed-room), and penned a hurried reply with"], [104, "96 god's providence house. tremulous fingers ; a reply reproachful in its bitter ness.

Robert Heywood had heard her chamber door unclose, the tap, tap of her peg-heeled shoes as she passed his room, heard the unlocking of the outer door, and watched from the drawing-room window the graceful form until the letter left her hand.

Those of Alice were examined, resealed and re placed : those of George removed to make way for others more in keeping with the first repulsive fiction ; until Alice, almost in despair succumbed to the belief that George was faithless, worthless, and had sought her affections only to deceive her. The very words George had used to warn her against treachery, and bid her trust his love and faith in spite of appearances, told against him now as a timely provision against the hour when his evil deeds should rise against him. Stung to the quick, bowed down to the earth by the weight of tormenting doubt and sad forebodings, Alice strove to hide her anguish beneath a veil of composure, which only Robert Heywood's enlightened eyes could penetrate. Still paler and thinner she became, her head ached more frequently, dark circles appeared round her dim eyes, and her efforts to appear light and cheerful were miserable failures. Mr. Prestbury, on his professional visits to Mrs. Ford, remarked this, and shook his clear head, but, not being asked for an opinion, wisely kept silence.

Margaret with the aid of a crutch had reached the long parlour, and sat in an easy-chair by the window, sipping a cup of chocolate, which Alice had just prepared. .Without ceremony Peggy entered, saying quickly \u2014 \" If you please, Miss Ailse, here be Moiles Wood askin' after Ph\u0153be Home, if she be here.

Miles stood in the middle of the floor, hat in hand, looking very de spondingly at the black and red tiles which he never saw ; but on the approach of Alice, he looked up and bowed deferentially. \" What is this, Miles ? There must be some mis take. You know Ph\u0153be has not been here for several months.\" \" I knew that, miss ; but we have searched every where else, likely and unlikely, so I thought I would come here as a last chance.

But Ph\u0153be kept hinting she could have a better match, if she liked ; and she said it so often, I got provoked, and told her my mind at last.

But he was not the man to keep a secret which stirred him deeply, and out it blurted before either Margaret or Alice could speak. \" I say, who do you think has eloped ?\" and he threw his gloves and whip on the table with an air which said, \"You'll never guess!\" \" Surely Ph\u0153be hasn't ?\" exclaimed both ladies at once ; interrupted by Michael's sharp \" Surely Ph\u0153be has !

He had gone on foot to Chester the day before, and had not returned. Miles was there over night inquiring for Ph\u0153be, but no one said anything then of his being away. I suppose they're used to his late hours, and think nothing of them.

That one was the last of the lot,\" and her father tossed a soiled letter into Alice's lap as he spoke. The paper rattled in her fingers as she tried to open it to read, so he took it from her trembling hands and read aloud : \u2014 \" My charming little Ph\u0153be, \" I have made all arrangements, and shall expect you to meet me, or a messenger I will send, at eight on Friday evening by the Grange steps to the river.

That folly has long been forgotten. If my mother thought less of her, we need not be married in secret, my charmer ! But married we will be, my angel, if you only are true to \" Your faithful adorer, \" George Latham.\" \" A precious billet that is, and the rascal who scrawled it deserves hanging !\" was the angry com mentary of Michael when he had done reading. \" Nay, it's the knave's writing, sure enough, and his sig nature too.

CHAPTER V. THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. Quite inexplicable to George Latham was the chill ing letter of Alice, found by him after three days' impatient and weary waiting. The indignant letter sent by her in reply to a malevolent fiction, received by him as her response to a warm and genuine fact ! He tore it open with all a lover's impetuous haste, as he hurried up the plantation path under the shadowing trees, unconscious that the spreading syca more overhanging the wicket bore an unnatural fruit, or that the evil eyes of John Tonks followed him with a hideous leer. The first cold words arrested his steps: \"Mr. Latham!\" Could it be Alice who ad dressed him thus ? Had he indeed mistaken her ? What, in his absence, could have changed her so com pletely ? He tore the letter up in broad strips and"], [115, "THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. 107 cast them from him. (How the tusks of the locksmith gleamed through the leafy screen). But second thought brought him back, to collect the scattered fragments. There was a light breeze blowing, and his hasty impulse gave him a chase after the pieces. Laying them together in the crown of his three cornered hat, he walked on slowly and mechanically, filtering each passage through his mind with a deli beration very new to him ; he remembered the enemies with whom he had to cope, and reflection taught him that scheming and knavery must have been at work to warp the mind of Alice, or such a missive could not have come from her in reply to his. Madam Latham was as much at fault as himself. Mrs. Peover had assured her of the imprisoned girl's truth and fidelity to her son only a week before ; she could not have changed so rapidly. \" Is fhis letter an answer to any portion of yours, my son?\" was her interrogation, after a little space for reflection. \" I think not, mother ! Mine was for the most part a replication of discoveries, and attempts to discover, whilst away. This letter is a perfect mystery to me. What is underlying it, God only knows !\" and he began to walk restlessly about the room. \" And to God you must look for the solution in his own good time. Nay, do not despond, my son ; that"], [116, "108 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. time may be nearer than you think,\" added the good mother, laying her hand on his shoulder as he threw himself heavily on a chair by the table, and buried his face in his folded arms. Another letter was written, disclaiming all thought of impugning the delicacy of Alice, and begging an explanation of that which was at once so cold and so obscure. As he was folding it, Madam Latham suggested that he should keep a copy, and though he could not see a reason for it, he made one. As singular an answer came to that, and after a lapse of days. Others were penned in remonstrance and anguish ; but the answers were as brief and bitter, then ceased entirely. George, restless and miserable, wandered about list lessly, or mounted a horse and galloped to Chester, without other object than to allay the excitement in his mind. In and out of God's Providence' House he was as he had never been. Would sit for hours talking to Mrs. Peover about Alice, and strove hard to persuade either her or his godfather to go over to the Grange, and convey a note for him to Alice. This they inexorably refused, on the old plea that the father was the true guardian of his child, and so long as Mr. Ford trusted them, they could not betray his confidence. \" No, no, George ; I love you as my own son,\""], [117, "THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. 109 said the old man one of these times, \" but couldn't let my son court any girl in secret \u2014 couldn't in secret !

No letters on the sly pass through our hands \u2014 our hands. I'll say a good word for you to Mr. Ford, if you like. What say you ? \u2014 what say you?\" \"Useless, useless!\" was the young man's despond ing reply. \"I fear so, fear so. Michael Ford thinks there's no one like Mr. Heywood.\" \" Oh, godfather, did you ever happen to meet this Mr. Heywood at the Grange, by any chance?\" in quired George, abruptly. \" Nothing ever happens by chance. Is no chance !\" sharply said Mr. Peover, regardless of the main ques tion, to which, however, Mrs. Peover, then entering the room, replied. \"Never, George, on any occasion. It was only yesterday that we were remarking how singular it was we had never seen the young gentleman of whom we have heard so much. Nor, though we must have passed him on the road close to the Grange, have we ever observed him. Very singular, is it not?\" \"Very,\" drily repeated George; \"very singular."], [118, "110 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. For he is not a man to be passed in a crowd \u2014 he is quite noticeable enough.\" \" So we understand ; his dress, too, savours over much of the vanity of this world.\" \" Oh, apart from dress, he has not a face one for gets in a hurry, or you would be likely to pass,\" said George, stiffly. \" Well, I suppose we shall see the wonderful man at the wedding \u2014 it draws very near now I under stand Miss Ford has ceased to oppose the match so strenuously as she did, and Mr. Ford hopes she will be compliant at last. I am not quite so sure of it as her father, and should not be surprised if she refused, even in the church, to marry.\" \" Thank God for that hope !\" exclaimed George, springing to his feet. She shall not marry the scoundrel, if I have to wrest her from him at the very altar!\" And snatching his hat, without another word he darted from the house, and galloped off home, using his spurs quite unnecessarily. By a strange infatuation, he had carefully avoided giving the worthy couple any inkling of his suspicions that Robert Heywood and Ned Bostock were one. He knew that for some reason or other the old man stood in considerable dread of his ruffianly nephew. But whatever the link that existed between them, he feared lest Mr. Peover should, to save his nephew from"], [119, "THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. 111 justice, give a hint that his godson was on the scent. There he wronged Mr. Peover, and wronged him self. No regard for his sister's son would have inter fered with his duty ; and he would have felt it sinful to hold back the truth which would save Alice from a forced marriage, and the Grange itself from a de signing scoundrel. No. Mr. Peover would not have stood by to see wrong done knowingly, even to save his nephew. It would have been well for George had he fully realised this phase of the good man's character. When the replies of Alice ceased altogether, George lost all command over himself, and determined at last to seek an explanatory interview openly. Ac cordingly he rang the bell at the Griffin-gate, asked to \" see Miss Ford,\" \u2014 was abruptly denied ; then \" Mr. Ford \" \u2014 he \" would ha' nought to do wi' a Leatham;\" \"Mr. Heywood.\" \"Mr. Yawood had gone away th' day afore.\" Desponding and heart-sick, he went home, feeling that his only chance was to follow Mr. Heywood to Manchester, hunt up proofs of a treasonable conspi racy, and give the leaders into custody, or, failing that, charge the unwelcome bridegroom with being an impostor', at the very altar, before the assembled wedding-train."], [120, "112 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Madam Latham (having her information from Ph\u0153be) acquainted her son that the friend whose bridesmaid Alice had been, in the spring, was married to a saddler in Bridge Street, and straightway George discovered that his horse required a new saddle ; then harness was needed for Dobbin, and thus he had excuses for sundry calls at divers times, during which he contrived to edge the conversation towards his neighbours at the Grange, so as to learn the time and place fixed for the obnoxious nuptials. On the last of these occasions, as he had his foot in the stirrup to depart, a roughly-clad urchin, whose features seemed to jar on some chord of memory, thrust a dirty billet into his hand, and was off before George could call him back. Unfolding the scroll, he read, in a woman's writing \u2014 \" Master George, \u2014 \"I am tired of the life of sin, of shame, and misery I have led these fourteen years.

Just as I had abandoned my search after Ned Bostock, his very paramour turns round upon him, aud, to work her revenge, helps me to mine.

Should I ride home and show her this ? Better not, perhaps ; I might miss my appointment. 1 think I'll go to the theatre for an hour or two ; it is about time.\" Leaving his horse at an inn in Werburgh Street, he strayed to the Theatre Royal with lighter spirits and more elastic step than had been his for many a day. He felt he was on the right track at length, and no fear of failure or thought of treachery crossed his mind. Sanguine and buoyant, all the depressing VOL. III. I"], [122, "114 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. influences of the past three weeks were swept away like thistledown before the breeze. He must succeed, and Alice would be his. No matter what the play \u2014 he saw it, heard it, but it is doubtful if, at its close, he could have told whether tragedy or comedy had been enacted. A drama had been acted in his brain the while, in which himself and Alice figured as hero and heroine, Ned Bostock the defeated villain, and Margery's daughter the avenging spirit ! His abstraction had been observed by a friend on the opposite side of the house, and at the end of the play, while the epilogue was being spoken, Mr. Prest bury (for it was he) came round to his box, and shaking hands, with the usual \" How d'ye do?\" which never waits an answer, followed it up with, \"Lovely weather this ; rather relaxing though to invalids. Am glad to see you about again, so brisk and cheerful. You had a narrow escape, young gentleman. Be tween the bullet, the broken leg, and the fever, to say nothing of your own impatience, you pretty nearly made an early visit to kingdom-come. Myself and Dr. Wimslow have good reason to congratulate ourselves on the success attending our treatment. It was a most critical case. By the way, your neigh bour, Mrs. Ford, has had a sad accident ; but I sup pose you know of it.\""], [123, "THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. 115 \" Yes,\" said Mr. Latham ; \" I have heard of it. Is it true she is incurably lamed ?\" \" Why \u2014 it is not easy to say decidedly \u2014 at present. Still she is progressing favourably ; and it is possible science and skill may overcome the difficulties of her case. We have hopes.\" \" I am glad to hear it ; but I must leave you, doctor, I have an appointment by the river side.\" \" Ah, you sly young dog ; an appointment, have you ! With a petticoat, for a guinea !\" \" Well, Mr. Prestbury, I may as well own as much. It is with a woman ; but as the whole happiness of my life depends upon it, I rely on you, as a gentleman, to preserve my secret.\" And George bowed himself out of the box, leaving Mr. Prestbury behind in a brown study. His dis cernment was at fault. Only a few months back the young man had been dying for Miss Ford, a young lady equally love-sick , and now he had an appoint ment on which his whole happiness depended, with a young woman by the river side. He did not say \"young,\" but of course she was. He would not be likely to make such a night appointment with an old one. Little thought George when, in the frankuess of his own nature, he owned the business which called him away before the curtain fell, how his own words I 2"], [124, "116 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. would rise in judgment against him on Mr. Prest bury's next visit to the Grange ; his very charge of secrecy being condemnatory. Notwithstanding the season of the year, the night was dark and cloudy, and as George picked his way along the ill-paved and worse-lighted streets, he mentally wished the harvest-moon would show her face, since he stumbled more than once in his eager ness to reach the meeting place. The Ship -gate stood about seventy paces from the old bridge, and had been a large arch of Roman con struction, but was then filled up on the side nearest the river with more modern masonry ; only a sort of confined arch, serving as a passage for pedestrians, being left. From this a short flight of steps, guarded on one side by a rude handrail, led to the lower level of the Dee bank. The interior of this narrow arch was in deep shadow, and fearless as he was, George hesitated to enter. He had no weapon with him of any kind, and the loneliness of the spot at that hour made it very undesirable either as a promenade or a passage. As he paused within a yard or two of the black archway, the neighbouring church-clocks struck the hour almost in concert. As the last stroke of the ten fell from the laziest time-keeper, a woman's head enveloped in a hood emerged slowly from the dark"], [125, "THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. 117 chasm, and turned cautiously from side to side as if to discern the presence of some one looked for. A sudden qualm came over him, but he thought of Alice and dismissed it ; besides, what fear need he have of a woman, and that Margery's daughter, on whom as a boy he spent all his holiday pence ! It was a venture for Alice, and cowardice was out of the question. Stepping up to the gateway, he said in under tones, \" Mally ?\" \" Master George, here I \" issued, in well-remembered tones, from the narrow gap in the solid wall, and a hand was thrust as if to meet his from under the cloak, which concealed a woman's form. He entered the postern, extending his own hand, which she grasped eagerly, saying, in a low whisper, \" Master George, you are punctual ; you shall not repent this confidence in me. Then in a louder key, though her voice shook, \" This is no place for our conversation ; before I have told my story some one on his way to Hand bridge may surprise us. Follow me down the steps into the shadow of the wall a little way, where we shall be hid from casual observation. If any of Ned's comrades were to find us two together, they would murder us both, come !\" She led the way and George followed, feeling his way by the handrail, not altogether satisfied that he"], [126, "118 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. was doing a very prudent thing. A few paces from the steps he stopped and refused to go farther. \" Whatever you have to communicate, Mally, may be told here as safely as anywhere ; no one could either see or hear us from the Ship-gate.\" \" As you like, it may be as well here as elsewhere. Listen !\" Her voice raised at the last word as his head bent. On the instant his arms were pinioned from behind, and a thick silk handkerchief thrown over his face, so as to drown his voice, and obscure his sight. In vain he struggled ; he was lifted from his feet (previously tied together) and carried between two men down to the brink of the water, then handed like a heavy log into a boat, as he could tell from the undulating motion. There was a whispering of voices, and the boat was pushed into the stream. Then there was more whispering, and the suffocating handkerchief was partially removed from his mouth aDd nostrils ; though his eyes were still closely bandaged. The muffled oars made no sound as they dipped into the water ; they were evidently going with the tide, and down the stream\u2014 but whither? The stench from accumulated hides told George's olfactory organs (muffled as they were) that they were passing Skinner Street, beyond that he had no guide for place or distance."], [127, "THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. 119 All that he had heard in Manchester of Mrs. Snow's abduction of her husband, and his tranporta tion to the plantations, flashed over his mind ; aud as the boat rose and fell with the longer swell of the waves, telling they were nearing the open sea, the horrible fear grew stronger. He felt they were bear ing him to some vessel lying at anchor near the Dee mouth, and made fresh efforts to free himself from his bonds. But to no purpose, save to rock the boat unpleasantly and exasperate his ruffianly captors, one of whom gave him a brutal kick as he lay help less at their feet, bound hand and foot, and bade him in surly tones, \" Ha' done !\" The rough reminder from the man's boot, was sufficiently strong to enforce compliance, and George had no alternative but to lie passive. With his brain in a tumult, how bitterly he repented the impru dence and impetuous incaution which had led to this result. Surging through his mind, not one by one, but altogether, rushed thoughts of home, aud his beloved mother ; of her agony and suspense ; of her death-bed soon or late, with no son to smooth her pillow, or soothe her dying hours ; of the terrible fate hanging over himself, with no prospect of escape, no chance of rescue ; of his rival's triumph, and the enforced marriage ; of the fate of his darling Alice, sacrificed to so black a villain ; of the unknown"], [128, "120 god's providence house. knavery which had turned her love for himself to bitterness \u2014 all crowded into his brain, crushing each other down, and threatening extinction to the mind itself, as he lay there helpless, tortured with appre hensions and unavailing regrets, counting every minute as ten. After a weary time to the captive, he felt that the boat's course was altered, the straining of the oarsmen, and the rush of opposing waters indicating that they no longer drifted with the tide, but rowed against it, or across the stream. In little more than an hour, which had seemed to George a whole night, the motion of the boat changed. With slackening speed, there was a slight rocking, as if the bark steadied itself ere it was propelled through stiller water into a different atmo sphere, and then suddenly stopped. Mr. Latham was lifted out, his feet unbound, and then, between two men he was hurried a considerable distance, along what he judged to be a narrow cavern, from the echo of their footsteps, and the dank, earthy smell. When the bandage was removed from his eyes, and their sensitiveness wore away, George found him self in a large vaulted chamber, hewn out of the solid rock. A lamp, suspended by chains from the roof, dimly lit the apartment, horn lanterns in men's hands adding but little to the imperfect illumination, though"], [129, "the appointment by the river. 121 they served to light the bearers through doorways leading to other chambers or passages. There was no lack of solid and good furniture, but it was all of antique form. Nor was there any dearth of food, a large table in the centre being supplied as if for a siege ; whilst glasses, flagons, and kegs implied a cor responding abundance of fluids. All this was not seen by George in the first rapid glance ; that was arrested in its survey by a crouching figure on a chair before him \u2014 pretty Ph\u0153be Home, with crushed hat, disordered scarf and kerchief, and torn robe, sobbing as though her little heart would break. Absorbed in her deep grief, she had not raised her head on their approach, and George was the first to break the silence. \" What ! Ph\u0153be, can that be you ? What evil fortune has brought you hither?\" was his abrupt exclamation. A short, sharp cry of delight broke from the girl's lips, and she sprang towards him, though the gleam of pleasure which lit her eye faded into disappoint ment, as she heard his question. \" Oh, Mr. George, you must know. I came down to the landing-place to meet you, as you desired, and before you came that ugly wretch John Tonks caught hold of me. He stuffed a filthy rag in my mouth so that I could not scream, and then \u2014 and then\u2014 he and another nasty"], [130, "122 god's providence house. man put me in a boat, and brought me here ; and \u2014 and \u2014 Mr. George, I'm sure you never told them to be rude to me !

I never desired you to meet me anywhere, and knew nothing of this place, until I was brought here by treachery and force, a prisoner like yourself.\" The amazement in his face as he said this was reflected in hers. Slowly rising from her knees she confronted him steadily \u2014 saying deliberately, but doubtingly, \" Do you mean, Mr. George, to deny that you asked me to meet you there, in your very last letter, when you seemed to think, because I had been silly enough to keep your presents and answer your other letters, I would run off to Gretna Green with you without a thought for Miles. If you will say that, you will say anything. And I don't believe one word of your being a prisoner, 1 don't ; you said you'd send a messenger for me, you know you did !\" The men in the background winked and nodded at each other, evidently enjoying this mystification exceedingly, but George, more bewildered than ever, could only reply \u2014"], [131, "THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. 123 \" Poor Ph\u0153be, I fear we are both the victims of a deeply laid plot ; you may see my hands are bound.

So, here's for a taste of the cherries,\" and he pressed his disgusting lips to hers, stifling her heart-rending screams. \" Release her, ruffian !\" vociferated George, boiling with indignation, and stamping with impotent rage, as he struggled ineffectually to free his hands ; \" Re lease her, I say !\" \" Not for you, young master,\" sneered the grinning wretch, with a considerable display of tusk ; \" I've waited for the kisses longer than I looked for, and I mean to have them. You're my sweetheart now, pretty one !\" And he rejoiced with a coarse laugh, chorused by his companions. The woman hitherto known as \" Mally,\" who had been the first to quit the boat, and had disappeared before George Latham's eyes were uncovered, now came hurrying in from one of the dark doorways followed in a few moments by a man, called thither, it would appear, by the shrieks of Ph\u0153be. The former threw herself upon the struggling pair, and with masculine force thrust John Tonks back, ex claiming roughly, \" Hold off, I say ! I'm mistress here.

His garb was a rough pilot suit. The tint of his cheek was gone, along with patches, periwig, colour of brow and lash ; and a faint, insipid, colourless face looked out from under a tangle of peculiarly light hair, through a pair of wicked eyes, while the voice came with a hiss through sunk lips and the gap where white teeth should have been.

Well, they will be made in time !\" And the sarcastic voice stopped, waiting a reply. \" I know I have fallen into the toils of as thorough paced a villain as ever cumbered God's earth ; but while the ' earth is the Lord's ' and all thereon, I do not feel myself at any man's mercy, still less at the mercy of a reprobate,\" was the firm reply of George, interrupted by a loud laugh from Ned Bostock, which echoed through the recesses of the cavern. \" Hark ! how the young cock crows, Mally ! That's one of my uncle's sermons second-hand. Didn't know you were a Methodist before, my young squire. You can turn preacher when you get to the planta tions, and convert all the blacks. Perhaps preach yourself free there, but you'll not do it here. Will he, Mally ?\" The woman so addressed did not answer until he"], [136, "128 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. repeated the question, and then, without turning round (she was busied at the table with her back towards him), replied, \" He'd be the first foe that ever slipped out of your fingers, if he did.\" Ned Bostock's brow contracted, as for an instant he mused over the equivocal reply ; but taking no further note, continued to taunt George, still standing near the middle of the room. \" Perhaps, Mr. Latham, you had better take a chair,\" quoth he, with mock courtesy ; as your stay is likely to be of some duration, a little repose may be refreshing. I have to thank you fcr your very useful nosegay from Fordbrook ; it was a most acceptable gift, I assure you, and one my sweet Alice duly appreciated. Nay, do not look so fierce ! the light nings of your eye will not scathe me, and your glance cannot reach the Grange.\" \" You are a monster !\" broke from the lips of the goaded man, who found how his delicate gift had been employed to his false rival's advantage. \" Is that one of Jacob Hunt's latest ' discoveries ?' That astute old man is perhaps wiser to-ni^ht than he was this morning. I should think he had discovered by this time that he was about to follow Mrs. Snow's first husband on a voyage of discovery to the West Indies, where he may perhaps discover a cure for deafness, blindness, and rheumatism. Don't you"], [137, "THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. 129 think coffee -planting in that salubrious climate will work a wonderful change in that infirm old gentle man ? You don't seem to appreciate my tender care for Jacob Hunt's health, Mr. George Latham ! Ton honour, I have a most tender regard for that esti mable man, and will not detain him a day after Mr. Heywood's wedding. We must rejoice his old heart with a sight of the certificate and a slice of the bride's-cake !\" A deep groan, wrung from George in his intense agony, issued from his lips, notwithstanding his efforts to appear unmoved, and Ned's eyes gleamed with the satisfaction of a savage torturing his victim at the stake. Ph\u0153be, bewildered and perplexed, sobbed and listened by fits ; and Mally, seemingly engrossed by her occupation at the table, lost not one word of the bitter revilings her paramour heaped on the head of her boy-friend, little suspecting the new seed ger minating in the woman's heart, or he would not have trod on the dangerous ground as he did, in reply to George Latham, who, stung to madness, spoke hastily. \" Neil Bostock, rogue and liar you ever were \u2014 false to those who loved and trusted you \u2014 false to every tie of honour or integrity; false to man and falser to VOL.

And lay this to heart, base knave, that the imbecile Jacob Hunt left your secret in other keeping than his own ; and whether I lie in this cavern, or cross the Atlantic, your gang and yourself will equally come to the gallows through his discoveries and your crimes.\" A dark shade irathered on the brow of Ned as this o imprudent speech swept from the lips of George ; but it cleared ere he replied, with more passion than he had shown heretofore. '' Fool ! Had Jacob Hunt discovered aught to affect the lives of either myself or friends, George Latham would not so readily have become the dupe of a woman feigning penitence and professing to be conscience stricken.\" \" Who told you the penitence was feigned \u2014 if the letter was ?\" sharply interrupted Mally. \" Folly like mine dies out with age, and is killed with unkindness, and unless matters take a turn, you and I will have an account to settle, Ned, before long.\" - Plague take the woman ! What is she driving"], [139, "THE APPOINTMENT BY THE RIVER. 131 at ?\" and he turned on his heel, grasped her gaunt wrist, and hissed out with throbbing upper lip, \" Yes ! you are right, we have an account to settle \u2014 and it shall be done sooner than you expect ! Is that supper ready, for we must be off?\" Backwards and forwards his followers had been passing laden with kegs and weighty packages ; but on this intimation they sat down and ate and drank with surprising appetites. Mally, with rough kind ness, pressed Ph\u0153be to join them, but the still sobbing girl shook her head ; she could not eat. George was never asked. The rude meal despatched, the hands of George were untied, and at once the thought glanced through his mind that if he could find the outlet of the cave after his enemies were gone, escape would be easy, as he was an incomparable swimmer; but the hope was swamped as soon as formed, for he was held between Black Luke and another burly brute, whilst John Tonks secured him by a chain fastened tightly round his waist, aud locked to an iron stanchion already in the wall, and not new to the service, as the worn metal attested. Then Ned Bostock, and his four or five followers departed, the former venting his malevolent ire on George ere he went ; and John Tonks bestowing on k 2"], [140, "132 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE.

THE GREY LADY! The woman named Mally, appeared utterly con founded at being left behiud ; she sat down at the table, on which she rested both her elbows, and thrusting her fingers in her hair, leaned her forehead in her palms, and so continued for a length of time in moody silence. For upwards of half an hour the stillness remained unbroken, save by an occasional sob from Ph\u0153be or a sigh from George, all three being too much engrossed with their own reflections to give their thoughts utterance. Mally was the first to speak. Without raising her head, she said in a thick voice\u2014 \" Master George, I dare say you blame me as the cause of your being entrapped, and brought to this place !\""], [142, "134 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. \" How can I do otherwise, the fact is indisputable,\" exclaimed George in much irritation. \" So it is ; but only in part,\" was her quick re joinder; \"aud not willingly\u2014 far from willingly, believe me. I have not forgotten the baby boy who used to be left to my care (I am six years older than you) when he spent a day at his godfather's, or the schoolboy who shared with me his cakes and fruit, or learned his lessons by my side, that I might learn with him. I was weak, but not wicked, when I left my pious mother and your good uncle's roof, to share the fortunes of his ungrateful nephew. I was virtuous and innocent then, but vain and foolish like many a pretty girl besides\" \u2014 (Ph\u0153be hung her head and hid her face in her hands) \u2014 \" and when he promised to make me his wife I dreamed I should be a lady. I little thought then to become what I am. The mar riage was only a mockery, and your bad uncle Latham the sham clergyman. I was deceived and ruined ; and, with no hope for the future, have sunk to what you see, the companion of a gang of smugglers and robbers, the mistress of their leader. Oh, Master George, what I have suffered and seen in all these long years! But I thought I had grown callous, until I was brought from Manchester last week, and learned that Ned intended to get married. If I had not loved that man I could never have stuck by him"], [143, "THE GREY LADY ! 135 so long\u2014 even though he was the father of my boy\u2014 he has treated me so badly. But for all that, the news of the wedding so soon to come off made me mad and desperate, and I began to think of revenge. Be lieving me utterly abandoned, and as vicious as himself, Ned let out all his schemes at once. I was to be made an honest woman of, by marrying me to Black Luke (the greatest ruffian in the gang), of course to keep me silent. I suppose he thought I had no more gratitude than he had, for he pitched upon me to get you into his hands. At first I swore I would not ; but finding him resolute, I consented at last, lest he should do it unknown to me, and let me have no chance either to warn or save you. At Ned's dictation I wrote the hypocritical letter which 'ticed you to meet me. I wish now my hands had dropped off before I did it ! From that moment I was never left to myself; perhaps he saw I was restless, and feared I should peach. And so I should, if he'd let me have a chance. And so I will, as soon as I get out of this den, never fear, Master George ! I'll put a stop to the wedding, I know, and to the rest of his capers. He let out more in that letter than he meant me to take for truth. He means to turn me over to another man like a piece of stale trumpery \u2014 does he ? But I'll see him swing on the gallows first !\""], [144, "136 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. The voice which had been thick and husky when she commenced, grew clear and strong, increasing in volubility as she raised her head and heated with her subject, until at length it became vehement as her passions, and she stalked about the floor pouring forth her sentences in a torrent. Ph\u0153be listened in silence, and half in fear. George as silent, because incredulous, and inclined at first to think Mally merely acting a part, yet watchful and wary. He had heard her brief altercation with Ned, and that at least was genuine ; and as her passion reached its height, so he felt assured was her desire for revenge, and anxiety to serve himself. But he had seen the scowl on Ned Bostock's face, which the woman had not, and felt convinced she was as much a prisoner as themselves, and their case was therefore hopeless. \u25a0 \"He richly deserves it,\" exclaimed George, \"for his offences are countless. But if his punishment depends on your escape from this cavern, I fear we may abandon hope. Mally, I am convinced he means to keep you here, or remove you with us !\" The woman stopped in her walk, then grew livid with rage, as the conviction flashed across her brain for the first time, that Ned had duped her thoroughly. \" Baulked ! baulked in the first good deed I have thought to do for many years. Who shall say there"], [145, "THE GREY LADY ! 137 is a Providence after this ?\" and she sank again on her chair despondingly. \" Is there no outlet from this cavern landwards?\" inquired George after a pause. \" Yes, there is, but no one knows it fxcept the captain and old Jeffery ; and they keep the secret snug enough, I warrant \" I've tried over and over a^ain to find it, but 'twas not a bit of use. We're fast here, sure as rats in a trap ;\" and with this very consolatory thought she leaned her head on the back of her chair, looking upwards at the lamp. Soon she turned towards Ph\u0153be, and observed in gentler accents, \"I'm sorry for thee, my lass, very sorry! I know the wretched fate thy pretty face has brought thee to. If I could only have got back to the city, I'd have had both the sheriff and the coastguard down upon the gang in time to save both of you. God help thee, poor lass, John Tonks is a foul brute, and thy lot will be worse than mine.\" '' Oh, dear, dear,\" sobbed Ph\u0153be, \" what shall I do ! Oh ! what will Miles think of me, and Mrs. Parry, of the Red House? I've a dress of hers in this basket. I was taking it home, and she will suspect I've stolen it !\" \" How came you into the nets of these poachers ?\" asked Mally inquisitively, addressing Ph\u0153be ; \" I'm"], [146, "138 GOD'S PRQVIDKXCB HOtISK afraid you have to thank yourself for what has be fallen vou.\" Ph\u0153be's tears fell fast. \" Ph\u0153be,\" then said George quietly, \"tell me. what was that you said about letters from me? What was their tenor? and how did you receive them?-' The girl hung her head ; but through her falling tears, and gasping sobs, managed to articulate. \" I got the first, Master George, last April, and there was a new ribbon in it. for me to wear on May-day as a proof of your friendship. Thou came others, in which you praised my face aud inv figure, and said I was too good for Miles, and \u2014and that you wished I was a lady born, to be a match for you. And you said you had changed your opinion of Miss Ford after her going to the races with Mr. Heywood ; and iu the very last you asked me to meet you at the river steps, to go off with you to Gretna Green to be married ! Some of the letters were sent by post, but most of them were put in the hollow birch-tree at the corner of the plantation, and there 1 put my auswers.\" \" Silly, inconsiderate girl ! did you know so little of me as to .think me capable of luring my tenant's daughter away from an honest man who loved her? One moment's reflection would have taught you that"], [147, "THE GREY LADY ! 139 I could not have wounded my mother's feelings by a clandestine correspondence, still less marriage with that mother's seamstress, however pretty ! And vain, indeed, must you have been to suppose that any man favoured with Miss Ford's regard, would fall from his allegiance and descend to you !\" Situated as they both were, some portion of George's contempt might have been spared, as he acknowledged when he had heard all she had to say. \" I own I was foolish and vain, Mr. George ; but for all that I was not as bad as you think. It is true I was pleased with your notice of me, and wore your ribband, and wrote an answer to thank you ; and when you called me pretty, I felt prouder than 1 ought to have done, and perhaps I did begin to think myself a very little too good for Miles (poor fellow !), and I'm very sorry for it, I am. But if I did, just to tease him, say I had got a better sweetheart than him, I only said it in fun, to see how he would take it, and I meant to make it all right again soon. And oh, dear, dear ! I cannot make it right now ; and he will think I have been so wicked as to run off with another man after promising to marry him.\" \" If that's what you've done,\" remarked Mally, very emphatically, \" you deserve your troubles. Bad"], [148, "140 god's providence house. as he was, I clung to the man I had chosen, even after he had deceived me, though finer gentlemen offered to take me from him. And if I was made a fool of, it was without my knowledge. But you have run into danger with open eyes. It serves you right, in my opinion.\" \" Why did you keep the appointment you supposed I had been knave enough to make, if you had no intention of deserting Miles ? He is a man in every way too good for you, and, I hope, will recover from the pain you have caused, whether we escape from this den or not,\" questioned Mr. Latham promptly. \" Well, Mr. George, when that letter came, so dis: ferent from all the rest, I got frightened, and began to think how very foolish I had been ; and, not daring to send any one to the steps with a letter, I came myself, on my way to the Red House, to beg your pardon, and tell you I loved Miles too well to leave him for any one ; or to send a message if you were not there yourself. And oh, dear, dear ! what will become of me now ?\" \" Have you the letters with you, Ph\u0153be ?\" de manded he, somewhat softened by her simple con fession, \" or where are they ?\" \" Oh, in my coffer, at home, amongst my trinkets and ribbons. I am afraid they will find it, and think I have gone off with you. Oh, dear !\""], [149, "the grey lady! 141 \" They will, indeed ! Oh, God ! what will Alice and my mother suffer now, if they believe the report?\" He buried his head in his hands, muttering, \" And I, fool-like, told the doctor I had an appointment with a woman by the river side.\" A new cause of distress had risen before him : he was not merely missing, but branded as a seducer! And he paced backwards and forwards in acute anguish, checked abruptly in his walk at times by the chain which limited his range. Mally, to divert his attention from sorrows she felt herself to have increased, placed food before him, de siring he would partake, while she once more, with wits and eyes sharpened by necessity, searched for the secret outlet. She lit a small lamp, and desiring Ph\u0153be to accompany her, left the chamber, remain ing away a considerable time. Neither spring, pas sage, nor door had they discovered when they re turned ; but Mally asked emphatically, \" Master George, can you swim ?\" \" Like a waterfowl,\" was the quick reply ; \" but why the question ?\" \" Ph\u0153be found this in Ned's own room,\" producing a small file. \" That staple is worn, and may be filed through easily, and that done your escape is sure, and ours must follow. Quick !\" This was addressed to George, who, grasping the"], [150, "142 god's providence house. file with a fervent \" Thank God !\" handled it too clumsily to satisfy the eager woman, who snatched it from him and used it with a dexterity very far in advance of his. The rattling of the chain and rasping of the file as she worked away, the other two looking on, drowned the sound of approaching footsteps, until the unwel come intruders came close upon them. Ph\u0153be screamed and hid herself behind Mally, who bravely stood her ground. The file was instantly wrenched from her by Black Luke ; and John Tonks, under the captain's orders, at once proceeded to replace the worn stanchion with a new one, brought, along with a box of tools, from some secret store. Ned Bostock, in a fury of ungovernable rage, struck the woman repeatedly ; but she snatched a knife from the table and threatened to stab him if he pro voked her further. Laughing at her threats, yet nevertheless desisting from his ill usage, he ordered Black Luke to remain and keep watch over the three until the following night. John Tonks was de sirous to bear his fellow company, but their captain would not hear of it : there was other work for him to do ; and love-making must wait till he followed his sweetheart over the water. Grumbling as he went, the vagabond limped aster his comrades, and soon, laden as before, they departed, leaving -the"], [151, "THE GREY LADY ! 143 cavern and its inmates to the guardianship of Black Luke. \" I'm of opinion, mistress, it's time you and that young one there went to bed; it's long past day break. If they don't make haste, they'll hardly get them things on board afore the d \u2014 d land-sharks are astir and down on them,\" quoth that worthy, with a jumbling of pronouns very confusing to his hearers, if they were interested in his remarks. Mally sensibly took the advice of the beetle-browed fellow, first, however, bringing a pile of rugs and boat-cloaks, which she spread on the floor for George Latham, with a whispered injunction to keep up his strength with rest and food, in case he had need for it. He thanked her for the precautionary hint. Soon the two women were asleep in an inner chamber, on a bed already there, and George, in spite of his tormenting fears and wretchedness, was asleep also. Black Luke had slouched about until the females were gone, and then, knowing the captive before him too secure for escape, threw his limbs across three or four chairs, and snored most pertinaciously. A day more of lingering pain aud suspense borne all together, and George is left in his dreary prison alone. Mally and Ph\u0153be, gagged and bound, were forcibly carried away (as the young man gathered from stray words) to a vessel lying in the Channel, and"], [152, "144 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. bound for France. Days and nights, irksome in their monotony of position, light, and solitude, only broken by the taunts and revilings of his persecuting enemy, passed by like months \u2014 or years, if counted by the pain compressed within their limits. At first his foe came with his followers as Ned Bostock, but soon the butterfly cast his slough, and Mr. Heywood, more trim and dandyish than ever, appeared, not from the river entrance, but the inner apartment, and tortured the poor prisoner with exaggerated accounts of pre parations for his bridal, and of the revulsion of feeling said to follow Alice's discovery of Mr. Latham's de fection, causing her to turn to himself as the worthier husband of the twain. There was a great grief and a stricken heart in the bar of the Black Bear, as well as in the stately drawing-room of the Lodge ; and the wheelwright in his lowly cottage felt much as Miss Ford might in her retired sitting-room at the Grange. If George Latham was the last survivor of a nu merous family, the hereditary owner of lands and ancestral records, was not Ph\u0153be the only child of a widowed parent also, for whom he had toiled and hoarded up with frugal industry? Was not she in her girlish beauty as dear to the heart of Miles as George in his manliness to Alice? But with the sorrow of Ralph Home and Miles, deepening their"], [153, "THE GREY LADY ! 145 loss, was mingled a sense of shame, as well as that of an irreparable wrong done by one hitherto esteemed and trusted ; and two upright men for the first time in their lives held down their heads when neighbours passed, refusing to be comforted. At the Lodge no such feeling intruded. The dig nified lady who bore sway under that ancient roof repudiated all belief in her son's guilt. He was in capable of treachery she maintained, and was most foully aspersed. The production of his supposed letters tended to confirm, not weaken, this belief: her experienced eye at once detected the fabrication, and she pointed out to the incredulous father and lover minute details in which they differed both in penmanship and paper from her son's ordinary cor- respondence. No sting of shame was, however, necessary to increase the poignancy of. the widowed mother's anguish : she wept as over an untimely grave. One attack had been made on her dear boy's life by men alike ruthless and hardened; and now she felt he must be either cruelly murdered, impressed, or kid napped : all he had revealed on his return from Manchester tending to show that his enemies had in theii power means to compass any villanous scheme of the kind. Beyond the Lodge, God's Providence House, and vol.. in. L"], [154, "146 god's providence house. the curate's, Madame Latham's protestations that the letters were forgeries, and her son deeply wronged, obtained no credence. The villagers one and all in sisted that \" great folks were as like to go astray as poor folks,\" and \" Madam Leatham's love for her boy made her bloind to his faults, loike the rest o' women.\" To the Rev. Mr. Gresham the brave mother turned in her bereavement, as did all who came within the sphere of his unostentatious ministry, for sympathy and counsel. To him she unfolded in an agony of grief her belief that her son was either kidnapped or murdered ; gave her reasons for the suspicion, involv ing the story of his mission to Manchester, and the rupture (by letter) between Miss Ford and himself; and concluded with a resolve to trace George out living or dead, if it cost the last penny of her pro perty. He was calumniated she knew, and it was his mother's duty to vindicate his character, and bring his persecutors to justice. It was Mr. Gresham, zealous for his friend's honour and safety, who rode to Chester, sparing neither time nor labour in fulfilling his self-appointed duty of seek ing a clue to that lost friend's movements on the day he disappeared. It was he who found Mr. Latham's horse at the inn in Werburgh Street, where it had been lest \"for three or four hours;\" he who heard"], [155, "THE GREY LADY ! 147 from Mr. Dutton how a rough-looking boy had thrust a dirty note into George's hand in front of his shop door ; he, too, who elicited from Mr. and Mrs. Peover the heads of George's conversation with them, and his threat to denounce Mr. Heywood as an impostor, even at the altar ; and he who learned from Mr. Prestbury of the appointment (on which the happiness of his life depended) with a woman by the river side. The inference that George had been inveigled into the snares of an enemy, by the abuse of his very love for Miss Ford, was deduced by the good clergyman and Madam Latham both, but that gave no clue whereby to find him. \" Water leaves no trail,\" and so no wonder the most vigilant quest terminated in disappointment by the river side : and dragging for the body was equally futile. Breaking open her son's desk, Madam Latham placed in her willing ambassador's hand a packet containing those copies of his letters George had made at her request, and Miss Ford's recent letters also, presuming that the hand which could so deftly imi tate her son's writing, might as readily counterfeit the lady's also. Tnis packet she desired him to deliver to Miss Ford, if possible, in private, in order that he might supplement Madam Latham's brief enclosure with such information or intelligence as was required to put the young lady in possession of L 2"], [156, "148 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. the facts known to himself, and elicit from her those she alone could supply, to complete their evidence of forgery, and point their suspicions to still fouler crimes. The good curate had undertaken a delicate and difficult commission. Miss Ford had for a lengthy period been denied to all visitors of whatever degree supposed to be imbued with Latham proclivities \u2014 Mr. Gresham amongst the number. Now, however, that George Latham was off, and in disgrace, it did not matter whom she saw. Consequently the visitor was ushered into the drawing-room where Margaret sat in an easy-chair (a sign of approaching convales cence), Alice and Mr. Heywood occupying seats by her side, near to the open window. Notwithstanding that Mr. Gresham extended his visit to the extreme limits of propriety, no oppor tunity was afforded for private discourse, however brief; and he had no other alternative than to hand the packet to the surprised young lady, saying it had been entrusted to his care, and he believed required her early attention. Mrs. Ford looked up languidly, with a faint ex pression of wonder, and Mr. Heywood, somewhat startled, sat uneasily on his chair, perplexed with curiosity anent the contents of that closely-sealed package."], [157, "THE GREY LADY ! 149 Shortly after the curate took his leave, Alice retired to her own chamber, to examine the packet in soli tude, convinced that the Rev. Mr. Gresham would not have consented to be the bearer unless it contained matter of serious import. Fain would Robert Heywood have arrested her steps ; and, had Michael been present, he could have done so easily, a hint from him that her longer stay was desirable, at all times sufficing to call forth an imperative command from her father. It was the end of the harvest, however, and Mr. Ford was too busy in his fields to remain indoors, and, in his absence, Alice was a free agent, never on any occasion deferring to Mr. Heywood's self-consti tuted right to control her actions. Could Robert Heywood but have obtained speech with Michael, he would have insinuated the impropriety of any mys terious communications being made, in such manner as to prompt not only a demand for the package, but also its committal to the flames unread. As it was, he held the wiser policy of silence, though he ground his teeth, and, in his own room, swore aloud at his defeat. With trembling hands Alice broke the well-known seal, and started as her own letters fell from the wrappage. Mrs. Latham's note was very brief ; it simply told that the writer had seen letters purport-"], [158, "150 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE.

She requested Alice to acquaint Mr. Gresham if she had penned those letters, or received from George duplicates of those enclosed. Her son. she added. had suffered greatly from the coldness and severity of Miss Ford's replies, and. if liring (which she doubted), must be a sufferer still. Mr. Gresham had further communications to make, if he judged it essential. Alice turned from tho cramped penmanship of the old lady to the well-known characters of George, uuforgotteu and beloved, though counted false an unworthy. The letters swam before her eves as she read; and she was compelled 'to sit down, or she would have fallen. Oh! how different those scrawl ing copies in their respectful tenderness. tVom the coarse aud presuming missives which had demanded those cold replies from her !

His death wduld break her heart! What further revelations had Mr. Gresham to make ? What that she ought to have heard ? Her brain reeled, the room seemed to whirl round, and for a time all was blank. There Peggy found her, slowly recovering ; and the kind-hearted woman, sorely distressed, presented a glass of water to the quivering lips, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing her revive. Observing the letters scattered on floor and table, and rightly connecting them with Miss Ford's faintness, the simple creature exclaimed : \u2014 \"If them pappers wur moine, oi'd brun them a', afore they made me feel so badly !\" and having said Alice was wanted to look after matters down stairs, Peggy withdrew, muttering as she went, \" Oi never knowed anny good come o' readin an' wroitin,' that oi' never did !\" The business of the days and weeks went on re morselessly, yet brought to Alice no chance of a reply to Madam Latham. Peggy was proof against all bribes, and stoutly refused to be the bearer of what she wrote. But the heavy eyes and failing health of her young mistress accomplished what no gist could effect, and, under pretence of taking her shoes for"], [160, "152 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Job Last to mend, Peggy went to Shotwick, and pressed forward as hastily as she could with the letter, which, while it confirmed beliefs, supplied not the wanting clue. Mrs. Latham, nerved by affection to exertions beyond her years, attended by the sympathising curate, sought Mr. Peover, explained the doubts, fears, and perplexities which beset her inquiries, and the supposed connection between Mr. Heywood and his nephew. The old man started. Another and more threaten ing letter had just been received, in which he was forbidden to leave the house for a month. But he had determined to be at the wedding in spite of everything, and now Madam Latham's suggestion made his presence at the church a matter of duty. Better he lost his old life than that dear girl, Alice, should fall into the clutches of a rogue like Ned ! The fifth of September was appointed for the bridal ; a young friend from Northwich, the daughter of Mr. Brad well, had been invited to the Grange by Mrs. Ford to act as bride's-maid ; and Michael, taking his daughter's silence for acquiescence, was in the best. of spirits, while Mr. Heywood was exuberant. The harvest was reaped and housed, the last stack had been thatched, and after the harvest-supper on the night of the third, Dick sat with Peggy in the"], [161, "THE GREY LADY ! 153 kitchen, hours after her fellow servants had retired to rest. Not that Peggy was conscious of the progress of the silent reaper Time \u2014 not even love would have kept her there till midnight. Dick had artfully contrived to put the kitchen clock back a couple of. hours (to the detriment of the works i, and so she sat there very composedly, or rather in a flutter of hope and expectation, by the dim light of a dip candle and the embers of the dying fire. By sundry infallible signs Peggy had been prepared for Dick's unwonted invitation to \" stop up an' have a talk, loike.\" She had dreamed of being buried, a sure token she was to be married ; then she had dreamed she was dressed in black, quite as certain a sign she would be arrayed in white. Moreover she had fallen up-stairs three times that very day, and had two spoons in her porridge- basin, equally in dicative of matrimony, \u2014 so Peggy sat by Dick's side in an unusual flutter, feminine instinct, even more surely than dreams and omens, anticipating the im portant proposal looming in the horizon of Dick's desire for \" a talk loike.\" They were seated on the settle opposite to the yard door and curtained window, expansive as the ponderous kitchen table beneath it, where rested the small candle in its primitive iron stick. Behind them the tall oak dresser, and its pewter fittings"], [162, "154 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. reflected the solitary light, like reporters taking note of their proceedings, while at extreme angles with the outer door, and at Dick's right, in deep shadow, the staircase (its door thrown back) yawned like a dark cleft in the wooden panelling. Dick was more loquacious than usual, the harvest ale having loosened his tongue when it rose to his head. He was pleasantly exhilarated, however, nothing more ; and a little more demonstrative in his love making, that was all. After discoursing very fluently on the work done by himself and Ben that day, in excess of any other labourers, calculating the bushels of grain in every rick or barn, and its value in the rising market (for Dick was a knowing body in his way), he branched off to the approaching wedding, and expressed a hope that the young couple might be happy, \u2014 sidling his lest arm round Peggy as he uttered the wish. \" Then oi dinna think as how they wull,\" said Peggy, with a sagacious nod of the head, taking no notice of the stray arm. \" Whoi not, lass ? He be as good as her, an' as foine a gentlemon, an' as free-spoken as a' chap moight wush to sarve. There binna his marrow in a' North wych.\" \" Mebbe not, Deak ! but there be loikly young gentlemen i' other pleaces besoides Northwych\""], [163, "THE GREY LADY ! 155 \" Dun yo' mean that Leatham chap ?

Peggy had been rolling up and down the strings of her check-apron, and the unexpected squeeze jerked the broad tapes into corkscrew ringlets, with which she continued to trifle without answering his question. Dick resumed, after a pause, gathering courage as he went on. \"Oi say, Peggy, how many years be it sin' we begun to keep company together ? \u2014 ten or twelve oi reckon !\" * Anglice \u2014 wore, spent."], [164, "156 god's TROVIDENCE HOUSE. \" Ten or twelve !\" (Peggy seemed to hold his arith metic in contempt) \u2014 \" more loike foorteen or sixteen !

What dost say, lass?\" \" Oi dunno,\" was the low answer from Peggy's lips, whilst her rough fingers twirled the tape ringlets unconsciously. \" Tha dunno! whoi Peggy, lass, tha dun'! An' Peggy, oi begin to think as how oi shouldn' ha' axed yo' that question manny a year ago ! An' so, if yo'"], [165, "THE GREY LADY ! 157 dunna say nay, oi'll go an' put th' banns oop next Sunday! What dost say V Peggy had not said anything, but she did then squeeze out the words, \" If tha' loikes, Deak !\" And that Dick did \"loike\" was testified by a close hug and a resonant kiss, which the long courted Peggy took complacently, whatever might be the unobserved flutter kept in bounds by the leather boddice. There was no intention on the part of either (when they talked of marrying before Michaelmas) to quit the service in which they had been reared ; and Dick, after expressing himself, with nature's eloquence, on the subject, began to describe a new cottage on the Grange estate which would suit them just as if it had been built on purpose. Perhaps it had been. He raised his hand to point across the kitchen, in the direction of the \" pleasant cot,\" when to the surprise of both, and the consternation of Peggy, the door \u2014 which Mr. Ford had himself locked for the night \u2014 slowly revolved on its hinges, and there, in the aper ture, revealed against the outer darkness by the pale light emitted from the gaping wound at her waist, spreading around her a luminous halo, was the spectral horror of the Grange \u2014 the Grey Lady. Deep and sepulchral were the glittering eyes, the lips and nostrils black, the cheeks hollow, the skin livid and cadaverous ; the breeze lifted the tangled"], [166, "GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. 158 mass of light hair falling over the shoulders, and, as the tall figure advancing swept with stately steps across the kitchen towards the staircase, the grey silken saque rustled over the chequered tiles. Peggy shrieked in irrepressible terror, and fell for ward on the floor in a strong fit of hysterics. Dick, however, fresh from the harvest in-gathering, had his pitchfork by his side, and, grasping the implement in his ready right hand, he hurled it with full force against the grey figure, then entering on the stair case, exclaiming, \" Dang un, ghost or no ghost, oi'll at thee !\" The weapon stuck for an instant, not in the oppo site wainscot, but in the back of the receding figure ; there was a hollow groan, the pitchfork fell with a clatter on the stairs, and thence to the tiled floor. The Grey Lady was gone ; but the dauntless man, sceptical as his master, snatching the iron candlestick from the table, darted up the dark stair, his candle flaring as he rushed along. The cheese-room door swung in his face and extinguished his light, but he thrust it back in time to see the ghost disappear in the recess near the fireplace with a sound like a heavy fall, leaving the corner where Dick stood in total dark ness, the slant rays of the harvest moon not streaming over more than a third of that spacious floor."], [167, "THE GREY LADY ! 159 CHAPTER VII. IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM. Utterly confounded, Dick stood for a moment or two, staring through the darkness in blank amaze ment ; and brave as he had been an instant before, the moisture of fear stood in palpable drops on his brow. The screams of Peggy recalled him to himself, and to the kitchen. It was as dark there as in the cheese room, the last blaze having died out before Peggy and himself were lest in undisputed possession of the territory. Groping about with extended fingers to find the tinder-box on the mantleshelf, at the immi nent risk of upsetting something or other, either on his own head or that of the prostrate Peggy, his hand came in contact with a bunch of matches, not the phosphorescent Lilliputians now in use, but Brobidig-"], [168, "160 god's providence house. nagians, \u2014 flat strips of wood at least nine inches long, amply tipped with sulphur at each end. Applying one of these to the embers where a spark was dimly visible, a light was obtained for his candle. Clumsily, but kindly, he then endeavoured to raise and support his sweetheart, whose fitful laughter, sobs, and shrieks, were beyond his power to allay or soothe. With difficulty (for she struggled violently, and was not a light weight) he contrived to lift her into a large easy-chair standing in one corner, and finding beside it a pitcher of spring water, he dashed the contents in her face. It was rough, but effectual treatment, for which the amateur nurse apologised when the emergency was over. Not till then, did he attempt to seek his master, and theu Peggy insisted on going also, not daring to be left behind. Mr. Ford, who had never slept soundly since he left Fordbrook, jumped out of bed on the first sum mons, and hastily donning his nether garments, opened the door. Imagine his astonishment to be hold the shivering and trembling Peggy, drenched with water, and Dick by her side holding her up lest she should stumble or fall. To his excited inquiry \u2014 \" What ! \u2014 whatever is the matter now ?\" \"Oh, measter, the ghost! the ghost!\" was all the white-faced woman could articulate."], [169, "in judgment against him. 161 \" Measter, an yo'll please to leave the wench here wi missus, till hoo comes round, an yo'll coom this'ns wi mea, oi ha' summat to say consarning th' ghost !\" Michael knit his brows, and set his teeth as a barrier to his temper when he heard of the fresh intrusion of the Grey Lady ; but as Dick proceeded, and he learned that the pitchfork met with resistance from a solid body ere it fell, a very fervent \"Thank God !\" broke from his lips, accompanied by a sigh of relief. For many months he had argued against the reappearance of the spirit parted from the body, with a growing conviction that his argument was untenable, fighting against superstition, yet losing ground with every contest, as the ghost of the Grange made her presence felt. And so the \" Thank God !\" which followed Dick's account, was the natural expression of his pent up feelings. \" Thour't a brave lad, Dick ! \u2014 a brave lad ! I'll be the making of you, Dick, for this. It's the best night's work you ever did. We shall find the villain out now,\" exclaimed the well-pleased master. They had gained the kitchen, as he said this, and were about to pass up the stairs, when Dick stopped to raise his pitchfork. \" Whoi, Measter ! the poikel's bloody !\" cried the man, in alarm. The prongs were tipped with blood, and drops of VOL. III. M"], [170, "god's providence house. 162 the same red fluid marked the upward flight of the Grey Lady from stair to stair, across the cheese-room floor to the spot where she vanished\u2014 not reaching to the wainscot, but stopping two feet distant at least both from the recessed wall and the projecting fire- place. \" Dick,\" said Mr. Ford, clapping the man on the shoulder; \"you have, indeed, made a grand disco very ; we have tracked the scoundrel to Ids hiding place at last. When we tried the panelling we never thought of the floor. What fools we were, to be sure ! Here, Dick, hold the candle lower. Yes ; the planks are cut off here in an even line. Let us try these nails. While he said this, half in soliloquy, half to his attendant, Michael, kneeling down, had examined the floor, and pressed all the visible nail-heads, but the planks remained immoveable. \" Run and waken Mr. Heywood, Dick ; he is sharper than I, and will find the spring (for spring there must be) while I am looking at it. How- Robert will rejoice at this,\" said he, rubbing his hands with glee as he watched the receding figure of Dick down the long corridor to Mr. Heywood's door, the caudle taken by Dick to supply the gentleman with a light glimmering faintly like a star in the dis tance."], [171, "163 IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM. Dick knocked and knocked, but received no answer. Alice and Miss Bradwell were roused, and a night capped head peered inquiringly round the door, then disappeared from Dick's unexpected gaze as suddenly. Michael, feeling that time was being lost, hurried himself after his man, and not receiving an answer, opened the unlocked door. Thrown over a chair was Mr. Heywood's coat ; but where was Mr. Heywood ? Not in the bed, that had not been disturbed ! Where could he be ? Certainly not in the chamber ! Michael stood as perplexed as though the ghost had risen before him there. Pre suming, however, his son-in-law had some reasonable motive for leaving his room partially dressed after the family were abed, he took the chamber candle from Robert's table to light himself with, and despatched Dick for Ben and two or three of the other hinds, charging him to be swift and secret. Straightforward Michael carried away the candle, marvelling much where Robert could have gone, yet with his ordinary oversight of things under his nose, never thought of the singularity that in going from his chamber Mr. Heywood should have left it extinguished behind him. He went through to his own room, and briefly told Margaret what he hoped to find, bidding Peggy \" cheer up.\" Next he tapped at his daughter's door, bade her not to be alarmed, and said he should have M 2"], [172, "164 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. good news for her in the morning. How good, neither he nor she anticipated ! Tools were procured to rip up the obdurate boards, if necessary, and Mr. Ford began to probe the seams with a chisel, the hastily summoned labourers looking on with wondering interest, and mouths agape. Dick overlooking his master, leaned heavily against the side of the fireplace ; all at once, his hand slipped with his whole weight on it, catching in its descent a rose in the carving. It slid downwards \u2014 simulta neously the square of planking shot under the fire place wall, almost, precipitating Michael down a steep flight of narrow stone steps, thus revealed to view. \" Here it is, by jingo!\" exclaimed Michael, as he recovered his balance, amidst a chorus of wondering monosyllables. By the light of the lanterns held by Ben and the farming men, fresh red drops were discernible in a plain track down into the black darkness. \" Oi hope oi hanna killed un !\" ejaculated Dick, his conscience rising in judgment against him at the sight of the wet blood. \" What does it matter if you have ; the blackguard deserves hanging for the mischief he has done here,\" insisted Michael, sharply. \" Then yo' dunna think un's a woman, Measter ?\" said Ben, and one of the hinds, in a breath."], [173, "+i IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM. 165 \" Woman ! I should think not ; did you ever know a woman keep a secret twenty years ? I never did.\" A general laugh followed this sally at the cost of womankind, though it was quickly suppressed. The haunted chamber had not lost its prestige so sud denly. \" Hadna yo better ha' yo're pestols, Measter, afore you go down theere ?\" suggested Dick, as his master began to descend into the dark chasm, bidding the others follow. \" A good thought, Dick,\" acquiesced Michael, \" I'll get them ;\" and having in a few moments obtained the weapons (wondering the while where Robert could possibly be so long a time), the whole party de scended the steps. Michael led the way, remarking as he went, that the secret staircase accounted for there being no recess in the parlour to correspond with that in the cheese-room, and blamed his own stupidity for failing to observe the discrepancy in the apartments when searching for this very passage. Down, down, far down a long straight flight of steep steps, to a broad plateau, and thence down a shorter flight diverging to the left. From these they passed in silence, broken only by the hollow echoes of their own footfalls, along a narrow vaulted passage hewn in the rock itself, for two or three hundred"], [174, "166 god's providence house. yards, without observing a sign of humanity beyond the occasional crimson sprinkling on the ground. A light glimmered through a half-shut door. Michael was the first to reach it. \" By jingo, lads,\" vociferated he, \" here's the Grey Lady caught in her own trap,\" as he leaned over what appeared a pros trate female figure lying in the gap of the partially opened door. \" Ben, help Dick to lift .my lady to the light ; and one of you hold that door open, or it will spring to and shut us all in !\" ordered Mr. Ford, perceiving the door he had expanded wide returned on the removal of his hand. It was a solid slab of stone revolving on a pivot, and when closed not distinguish able from the wall, so the precaution was a wise one. Ben shrank from touching the mysterious figure, so Michael, while the door was held back, himself raised the head and assisted Dick to carry it forward into what appeared a well-fitted chamber, with a lamp swinging like a censer in the midst. Carrying their burden to lay it on a narrow bed by the wall, the light fell on the ghastly face. Michael almost lost his hold. \" My God ! how like to Robert this fellow is !\" broke from his lips involuntarily. \" Whoi, he be mortal loike Mester Yawood, sure-ly !\" echoed Dick, as he helped to lay the insen sible form down."], [175, "167 IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM. \" So he be !\" added Ben, and the hinds looked as if they thought the same. A groan had told of life and pain, exciting sym pathy in the breast of Michael even for his enemy. \" Dick,\" said he, \" strip the fellow's shoulders and try to stanch the bleeding, while I look about for something to give him. We must settle our scores elsewhere ?\" He had not to look far, there was brandy in a bottle on a sort of dressing-table, crowded with paints, perfumes, powder, pomatum, and all the requirements for an elaborate toilet of that period. More than sur prised at all he saw in that well-appointed subter ranean chamber, and desirous to explore beyond, he resigned the wounded and still unconscious man, whose ghostly career was at an end, to the care of Dick and Ben, and called the hinds to accompany him, first, however, placing a seat in the doorway as a wedge. An ordinary door at the opposite side opened into a second vaulted passage, with branches extending like arms to the right and left. A light gleaming at the end of the main passage, Michael stepped towards it briskly ; but the low murmur of a voice reaching his advancing ear, he trod more cautiously, listening before he quitted the friendly shadow, lest he might come unprepared on a for midable foe."], [176, "168 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Hark ! What was that ? aud why did Michael's eyes dilate in astonishment ? Surely that was not the utterance of an enemy ! \" Oh, Alice, Alice, what misery our persecutors are heaping on you ! Little does your obstinate old father, in his stupid blindness, see of the wretched ness to which he dooms his darling and mine. God help us both ! I feel as if I were going mad ! Lying here, chained and powerless, knowing the great crime that villain will consummate unchecked ; and my poor Alice, for whom I would give the last drop of blood in my heart, the innocent victim. God help the poor girl !\" The voice died away in a despairing groan, and Michael leaned against the dank wall too overpowered by what he had heard, to press forward and ascertain who this unknown worshipper of Alice might be ; who spoke of her as a \" victim,\" and himself as stupid, obstinate, and \"blind.\" Remembering, how ever, that Alice was a common name, and a stranger most likely referred to, he endeavoured to still the uneasy something at his heart which smote like conscience, and entered quietly, with one hand on a pistol as a safeguard. Was Michael asleep and dreaming, or was he in Bedlam and a lunatic ? Before him, chained to the wall and seated on the bare floor, was the man"], [177, "IN JUDGMENT AGAINST lint. 169 supposed to have carried off Ph\u0153be Home, and be living with her in sin and luxury far away ! Yes, there was no mistaking that open and manly countenance once known, even though misery and neglect had marred its comeliness. Neither comb, brush, razor, nor water had been placed within George Latham's reach during his captivity ; his food had been scant and poor, though the table was heaped with dainties, his captors faring luxuriously, if rudely ; and hunger, dirt, and neglect, are sadly destructive of good looks. Believing the steps betokened the approach of his tormentor, Ned Bostock, only, he did not deign to raise his head, having, as far as human endurance would permit, maintained a rigid silence under taunts and mockery. Michael's sharp exclamation, in which mingled at once emotions conflicting and confusing, caused him to look up with a sudden cry, and rise to his feet as quickly as his impaired strength would allow-. The blank pause which succeeded their ejaculatory recognitions, was followed by Michael's agitated in quiries. \" Good God ! can that be Mr. Latham ? What horrid mystery is this ? How is it I find you chained and a prisoner, beneath the very foundations of my own dwelling?\" \" Mr. Ford, you must ask your trusted friend, Mr."], [178, "GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. 170 Heywood, that question. I only know that I am his prisoner, and here. Of the situa \" \"Mr. Heywood, sir! Are you mad, or am I?\" interrupted Michael, in wondering incredulity. \" Neither, Mr. Ford, we are sane enough ; but the foul deeds of that smooth-faced villain, are calculated to drive honest men to madness,\" replied George much excited. \" Can this be true ?\" murmured the astounded man to himself, as he sank in a chair for the support his limbs refused. \" Only too true, as I can prove, readily. But first, let me ask how it is I see you and your labourers in this den of robbers ?\" \" Den of robbers !\" echoed Michael in perplexity. \" Well, sir, we discovered a secret passage, and came hither in search of the mysterious Grey Lady, whom we have caught at last, thank goodness. The vaga bond is wounded, and has played the ghost for the last time, I'll bet odds. I owe him a long debt, and intend to pay it to the last farthing.\" \" I am glad that scoundrel is detected ; Mr. Hey wood's turn comes next. Pray, Mr. Ford,\" continued George Latham, \" examine your pistol ; you wall find the charge withdrawn.\" \" By jingo it is ; and from this also !\" burst from Michael, more confounded than ever, as he turned"], [179, "IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM. 171 his pistols over, and snapped them uselessly. \" How is this ?\" \" I can tell you, sir. Your most worthy friend has, I understand, a chamber communicating with your own, and has made your weapons his peculiar care from the time you first met at the Blue Posts. You look incredulous, Mr. Ford, but there is no time to be lost. This is the retreat of Robert Heywood's gang, and you may require your pistols immediately. Reload them, I beg, without delay ; or if you have brought no ammunition, supply yourself and servants with weapons from yonder chest,\" said George Latham, indicating with his hand a locker by the wall. Michael sat as a man paralyzed. One discovery treading so closely on the heels of another, together with these allegations of fraud and crime against his valued friend, utterly overwhelmed him. His faith in Robert Heywood was unbounded, yet there was something in the truthful manner and tones of Mr. Latham which impressed him in spite of himself; and the observation respecting the pistols was, to say the least of it, a most remarkable coincidence, he admitted. But he remained in a sort of maze, almost too confused to think ; while George, knowing the ordinary habits of the smugglers (for such they were), expected the momentary appearance of one or more"], [180, "172 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. to meet their captain, himself then behind time, and he became alarmed for the father of Alice, seeing that his wonted energy had apparently left him. Besides, his own escape depended on the safety of Mr. Ford, and his anxiety increased. \"My men,\" said he, addressing the hinds, who had stood watching in as mute bewilderment as their master, \" open that chest, and arm yourselves. Mr. Ford, I beg of you either to retire, or prepare for defence.\" Then to himself, \" If I were only free, I might be of service ! My good fellows, there is a box of tools somewhere about \u2014 somewhere beyond that door \u2014 I will amply reward you if you can find it, and force my chain !\" Hope of reward stimulated the search, the tools were found, and before long George rejoiced in unfet tered limbs. His first task was to arm himself, his next to rouse Mr. Ford from the vacant reverie in which he continued. \" Mr. Ford,\" remonstrated he, \" this is imbecility ; your life is imperilled by delay. Should Mr. Hey wood's desperate comrades find you here, and thus, your life will be sacrificed remorselessly to preserve their secret.\" Slowly Michael rose to his feet, looked steadily down into George Latham's face, and said, \" Young man, I have done you a gross injustice, if what you."], [181, "IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM. 173 allege be true. But I must have proof. I cannot wage the unsupported word of a Latham against the honour of Mr. Heywood. True, you may have been captured by smugglers, but a jealous devil may prompt your impeachment of Robert Heywood, as their \" \"Mr. Ford,\" interrupted George with warmth, his proud spirit rising, \"your prejudice is at once unwarrantable and intolerable. Only assist me to escape, and I will find proofs to hang the scoundrel, if he had as many necks as names. I do not ask further how you found your way hither ; I am con vinced it was not with his consent. But unless you are anxious to capture his confederates at once, and feel your force sufficient to encounter two or three stout ruffians, well armed, I would advise you to return as you came.\" \" No sir, I will see the game played out, whoever be the bowler,\" was Michael's decided answer. \" They are coming,\" exclaimed George hurriedly, \" I hear them ; hide in the passages. I will resume my place ; you can rush upon, and secure them easier, if suspicion be disarmed first.\" Barely had they taken the positions assigned, be fore John Tonks, Black Luke, and another man came into the cavern, all somewhat the worse for liquor. \" I say, younker, we've been drinking success to the captain's wedding with the Beauty of the Grange."], [182, "174 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. How do you relish the toast, eh ?\" hiccoughed John Tonks, leering in the face of George, who sprang upon him, as Mr. Ford darted from concealment on the other two, followed by the hinds, who, casting aside weapons which were only an encumbrance, threw themselves upon the men from behind, and pinioned them down, as if in a vice. One man at the outset, seeing the odds against them, after filing a pistol at George's head with unsteady aim, dived under Michael's arm, and running back down the passage towards the boat which had brought them, was quickly beyond reach. Coils of rope lay about, and with these the half drunk ruffians, captured almost without a struggle, were secured firmly amid a shower of imprecations. The sight of John Tonks staggered Mr. Ford : he had defended that man against the accusation of Miles, solely because Mr. Heywood had recom mended him, and he had felt that simple introduction to be a guarantee for integrity ; yet here he was, Mr. Latham's first \"proof\" against Robert. But if John Tonks caused Michael's heart to sink with the sickening inseparable from the discovery of treachery in one loved and trusted, an examina tion of Black Luke excited a feeling akin to gratifi cation. \" By jingo, this is better luck than I expected ! So"], [183, "IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM. 175 my good friend of the forest, we have met again, have we ? The halter has waited for you some years, I should think. It will get its due now, or I am no prophet,\" said Michael exultingly. \" D \u2014 m you, I'm not hanged yet, and don't mean to be ; the rope's not twisted for my neck yet, for all your fine prophecy,\" growled the fellow. \" Jack,\" added he, turning to John Tonks, \"do you think th' captain's peached ?\" \" Peached ! No, you fool, he dare not !\" was the sullen answer of the other, grinning like a wild beast. Bound though they were, it was not an easy task to remove these men ; but by dint of pulling and haul ing, and the final persuasion of a pistol, in the hand of George Latham, they were urged as far as the inner chamber, where Dick and Ben had been left with the fictitious Grey Lady. \"Do you ask for further proofs ?\" exclaimed George in surprise, \" with that proof in your hands ? Why, there is a proof of even more than I imagined. Ned Bostock, Robert Heywood, or Grey Lady, all \u2014 all in one before you,\" pointing to the bed where lay the wounded form of his enemy, recovered from his swoon. \" What ! What ! You don't mean to tell me that also is Oh, God, this is a blow !\" And the stout"], [184, "176 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. yeoman clasped his hand to his forehead, and reeled as if he were drunk. It had needed but the reminder of George Latham to recall the unpleasant likeness which had caught his attention previously, with the absence of Mr. Heywood from his room; and once set in motion, Michael's clear bead worked out the rest for himself. Still there was but a likeness between the white-faced scoundrel before him and the friend he loved as a son. He had heard of a scapegrace resembling Robert ; this must be the one. \"Mr. Latham,\" expostulated he, \"you must be mistaken.\" (George shook his head.) \" There is a fellow in Chester \u2014 a wild good-for-nothing \u2014 so like to Mr. Heywood they can scarcely be known apart except from complexion ; this must be that rascal ; I cannot believe otherwise.\" \" Mr. Ford, I am sorry for your distress, and can understand your dilemma ; for though I had known Ned Bostock from childhood, and suspected Mr. Hey wood was an impostor, yet when I met him face to face on the Walls, in the race week, my penetration was at fault, so complete was his disguise.

He thought himself secure \u2014 that I was dead to the world, and could tell no tales \u2014 and so, with devilish malignity, to torture me with pictures of a success based on my own ruin, he unfolded all his plots and schemes, from first to last, mocking at Providence the while, until even my faith was shaken, and I began to despair of succour or rescue. He waited but to wring my heart with certain tokens of his marriage, before he shipped me off to the West Indian plantations, whence the white slave has no more chance of escape than the black. It was his hand that shot me down on Christmas Eve, at the bidding of Jeffery Latham. You start, Mr. Ford !

She had been assigned, in her young beauty and guilelessness, to the loathsome reptile scowling on us from yonder corner, in pay ment of his share in these transactions. Thank Heaven, she will escape that miserable lot !\" John Tonks ground his tusks and shook his fist at Mr. Latham, foaming at the mouth with suppressed rage. \" If this be all true \" began Michael. \" If!\" interrupted George. \"If! Mr. Ford. Look at those men ; examine the wicked face on that jrillow, distorted as it is by the anguish of defeat, and the longing for revenge \u2014 look there, if you would have confirmation of my statement ! Look at him writhing in the consciousness that retributive justice has found him even in the hour of his success, and that I, whom he had spared from death only to give zest to his wicked triumph, shall rise even from the bowels of the earth to bear testimony against him ! Look at him, Mr. Ford ! Does not his changing coun tenance witness to my truth ?\" There was little occasion to bid Michael Ford look at the prisoner on the bed (whom we shall continue to call by his alias, Robert Heywood, to prevent con-"], [187, "179 IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM. fusion) ; he had scarcely turned his sad eyes away, so much hope and faith lay wounded with that man. Robert Heywood, whether from faintness or shrewd policy, had not uttered a syllable beyond such excla mations as seemed the natural result of pain. Now, however, raising himself on one elbow, he looked at George and hissed through his set teeth \u2014 \" Curse you, George Latham ! Curse you ! It is your turn now ; but even from the depths of a prison my vengeance will reach joxi, as surely as you think yours has overtaken me. I swear you shall not live to wed Alice, and exult in my downfall. Curse you! \" Curses, like chickens, come home to roost, Robert,\" said Mr. Ford, with enforced calmness. \" It is time, however, to end this scene. I need no further evidence ; your own tongue condemns you. Dick, do you think he could walk ?\" \" Happen he moight, measter ; but it's a longish bit to th' house, an' he's lost a soight o' blood.\" \" Then raise him in the coverlet, and when you and Ben are weary, Bob and James can take your places. It is time we had a surgeon to him,\" said Michael. \" Yes, or justice may be cheated of its due, and the hangman of his fee,\" added George ; \"and I have N 2"], [188, "god's providence house. 180 suffered too much at his hands to spare him ; though for Mr. Peover's sake I am unfeignedly sorry.\" \" Why for Mr. Peover ?\" was Michael's surprised question. \" That man, Ned Bostock, is his nephew, the plague of the old man's existence.\" \" If that be so, he is a burglar also, and bears marks on his shoulders to commit him ! Mr. Peover need be thankful the base ingrate's career of crime is stopped.\" \" Still I do not believe my godfather would care to see his nephew hanged.\" \" Hanged !\" The word grated on Michael's ear : he could not yet realise that the man carried slowly in advance, in accordance with his orders, was one and the same with the jaunty gentleman who had done him once a signal service, and would in two days have been his son-in-law ; and yet the word \" hanged \" jarred discordantly on his nerves. He had \" built a most absolute trust \" on Robert Hey wood, and in one night the whole temple in which he had worshipped had crumbled to dust, and lay at the foot of the man both had maligned so mercilessly. Besides, he owed to Robert Heywood one debt of gratitude which had not yet been cancelled. His rescue in the forest, even if the assailants, as he saw"], [189, "IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM. 181 now, were Robert's own followers, was not the less a rescue, and he owed him a life. How soon even that delusion was dispelled by the breath of George Latham ! \" Mr. Ford,\" said he, breaking the silence, and disturbing Michael's ruminations, as they followed in the wake of servants and prisoners, \" you believe yourself under obligation to Mr. Heywood, do you not ?\" \" The very thing I was just thinking. Yes, sir, I am under obligation to him \u2014 I owe him my life ! For although I perceive in the black-bearded rascal before us \u2014 the man who stabbed and would have murdered me \u2014 still Robert's arrival was most oppor tune ; it prevented the execution of the threat, and his surgical skill was unquestionably serviceable.\" \" My dear sir, from first to last you have been the dupe of a consummate villain and hypocrite. The attack on you was planned at the Yacht Inn the previous night. The charge was withdrawn from your pistols whilst you breakfasted at the Blue Posts, and the nails from your horse's hoofs whilst you dined at Kelsall. Murder was the last thought in the men's heads. Your life was perfectly safe ; but Ned Bostock wanted an introduction under your roof, and so, as Mr. Heywood, he arranged that attack and deliver ance. He came up from an opposite quarter (having"], [190, "182 god's providence house. waited at the cross-roads for the signal \u2014 your af frighted horse) as a more complete blind. In his rough life such surgery as he possesses is often brought into requisition, and you owe him anything but gratitude for his equivocal service that day. Since my imprisonment here, I have heard the men before us laugh with him on the excellence of the scheme, and congratulate themselves on its success.\" \" Surely it was not necessary to half-kill me to obtain an introduction at my house ?\" objected Michael. \" No, sir, but it was essential to la}- you under weighty obligations in order to obtain the hand of your daughter, and with it the Grange, so long aban doned to Jeffery Latham and his associates. Your tenancy rendered the secrecy of theh haunt no longer safe, and it was determined to oust you by fair means or foul. They are hatching a conspiracy against government, and required the Grange as a rendez vous, and a receptacle for military stores.\" \" How did you learn all this, Mr. Latham ? Surely they did not prate of dangerous secrets like these before you?\" \" Oh, Mr. Ford, part of this I ferreted out disguised for the express purpose, during a month's watch in Manchester ; the remainder I heard piecemeal in the cavern.

Some difficulty had been experienced in carrying the litter up the short flight of steps, so on the broad plateau it was judged advisable to put their burden down ; and leaning on Dick, his temporary guard, arrayed still in the garb of the Grey Lady, Ned Bostock entered the Grange at daybreak a prisoner, where the night before he had been Mr. Heywood, the most honoured guest of the owner, to be Mr. Heywood never more."], [192, "184 god's providence house. CHAPTER VIH. AT LAST! The roots of prejudice struck deep into the heart of Michael Ford, as those of a forest tree into its native earth, not to be torn up violently without disturbing the soil or leaving quivering fibres behind as it came crashing down. But the tree might be restored to its former position, and in time put forth fresh leaves, the rudely uprooted prejudice might not. A scathing storm had swept over the head of Michael, in one night, rending from their place prejudice and pre possession alike deep-rooted. Not until passion overcame policy and Ned Bostock's own vengeful lips betrayed his identity with Robert Heywood, did Mr. Ford surrender liis trust in his favourite ; nor even then so completely but a faint hope yet lingered in his breast that he might be found"], [193, "AT LAST ! 185 asleep in his own room, to confute his defamer. The last film of the cobweb disappeared when Ned Bostock was laid on Robert Heywood's bed and stripped of his ghastly habiliments. Beneath the grey silk sacque, was the trim gentleman (minus his coat) as he had left the supper- table. No need for perriwig to con firm identity, no need to search the table for dye to tinge eyelash or eyebrow, or liquid rouge to warm the sickly skin, or the Paris-made teeth to fill the vacant gap in Ned Bostock 's mouth : no need for these to cause Michael to turn aside convinced, wounded, in dignant, and conscience-stricken. He had done George Latham a great wrong, and the subtle tempter lying there had been chief prompter. One by one, as rays of new light poured into the deep cells of memory, words and tones and suggestions came flashing up to tell how cunningly the evil principle had been evolved from his own heart, and how artfully his natural prejudice against the Latham blood had been strengthened and confirmed. The voice of Margaret in the adjoining room, sounding through the open door, reminded him of her lameness and its cause. From that moment every touch of compassion or compunction was gone, wrong done to himself he could have forgiven ; injury done to his little wife was beyond the pale of mercy. Sternly he gave orders for guarding the prisoner (the"], [194, "186 god's providence house. others had already been removed below), and led Mr. Latham down stairs, as anxious to repair the injustice he had done, as Alice had foretold he would be. Still he felt shy and awkward as a child who has done mischief, yet feels a sense of humiliation and self abasement in confession, and shrinks from the for midable words, \" I beg pardon.\" \" Mr. Latham,\" said he, \" I have done you an irreparable wrong, for which it shall be my study to atone as far as lies within my power. I cannot efface the memory of past pain my blind prejudice and harshness may have occasioned ; but if you are not dis posed to reject the hand I now extend as a gage of future friendship and good feeling, I will endeavour to prove my regret aud repentance sincere.\" George took the extended hand and shook it warmly. \"Mr. Ford,\" said he, \"I know how difficult it is to extinguish the embers of a family feud, and with that arch-hypocrite at your elbow to fan the dying embers to a flame, I am not surprised that it burnt fiercely. However, that is past, and I trust to prove worthy your esteem and friendship in spite of my name. It is scarcely the fittest time to remind you of my pretensions to your daughter, whom I hope I may have the great happiness of meeting in a few hours with your approval. At present, I must hasten to my mother, who, I learn from your hinds, believes"], [195, "AT LAST! 187 me murdered, aud is in great distress on my account. I shall call in the village and send Miles forward to break the news to her.\" \" I think, Mr. Latham, you had better trust one of my labourers instead, carefully instructing the man what to say. The entire village, more particularly Miles and Ralph Home, are exasperated against you as the supposed seducer of Ph\u0153be, and there may be delay, if not danger, in passing through, until the truth reaches their ears.\" Attended by Mr. Ford to the Griffin-gates, which, once unlocked, he left open, George pressed onward with Ben at his heels, through the plantation to the Lodge. The sun was rising in the east, the dew sparkled on leaf and shrub, birds sang or chirruped their matins from nest or bough, and the wakening life around symbolled the new life awakening within himself. He inhaled the fresh air with a grateful sense he had never felt until his long confinement underground taught him its value, and trod the home ward path with the elastic step of regained liberty. The servants had just risen when Ben stepped up to the back entrance, followed shortly by Mr. Latham, amidst a clamour of joyous voices. A maid was des patched to awaken Madam Latham and say that a man had come with a message from 3Ir. Ford concern ing Mr. Latham. Then, not to hurry the old lady to"], [196, "188 god's providence house. rise and dress at that early hour, a second was sent, with an intimation that news of Mr. Latham had been received \u2014 that he was alive \u2014 that he was well \u2014 and finally George himself rushed to his mother's bedside, and locked in her embrace mingled his thankful tears with hers. What mutual revelations of treachery and suffering they had to make ! How the mother grieved as she looked on his thin, unshaven face, hastily washed in Robert Heywood's room, his matted hair, his dirty and disordered dress, those sure tokens of restraint and ill usage. How she clung to him as if restored from the grave ; and with what intense interest she listened to the story of his liberation, and Mr. Hey wood's capture, as the ghost of the Grange. After a time George left his mother to rise and dress, whilst he sought his own room to perform not only the very necessary ablutions, but such a toilet as a young gentleman considers absolutely necessary to render him presentable to the lady of his love. Most refreshing and acceptable was that comfort able morning meal to the half-famished man, but he ate and drank with discretion. He solicited his mother to send for Miles, and assure the worthy fellow his Ph\u0153be was not as fickle as was believed, and instead of having eloped with him, had been abducted by John Tonks, then a prisoner at the Grange."], [197, "AT LAST! 189 Then once more he threaded the plantation path, and emerged from the wicket just as a posse of con stables with Black Luke and John Tonks in their midst, securely handcuffed together, came through the Griffin-gate. Threatening looks and imprecations saluted him as he passed on, after a casual word to the chief officer, but they affected him not ; he was entering those gates at last to meet Alice, not clan destinely, but with her father's full concurrence, and neither the scowling brows of the ill-looking prisoners, nor their foul language, could intercept the radiant future opening before the sanguine lover. Beneath the porch he found Mr. Prestbury, with one foot in the stirrup and his hand on his horse's neck. Busy talking, with head averted, he had not observed Mr. Latham's approach ; but seeing him, at once the foot was withdrawn, and he grasped the young gentleman's hand, shaking it with every demonstration of hearty good will and gratification. \" Delighted to see you again, my young friend, after your adventures ! What a narrow escape you have had to be sure ! Your excellent mother be lieved you were food for fishes ; and our good friends here had reasons for regarding you as little better than a heartless libertine. You'll not be inclined to make another appointment with a young woman by the river side in a hurry!\""], [198, "190 god's providence house. \" Indeed, I shall not, but I believed the occasion warranted what I felt even at the time to be rash and imprudent ; and, Doctor, she was not a young woman. I went to meet Margery's unfortunate daughter Mally, lured by a letter offering to betray Ned, and reveal secrets of the utmost importance to me.\" \" Ah \u2014 yes \u2014 so you said ; and I, with the rest of the blockheads, thought that what ' the happiness of your life depended on ' must be a woman, and a young one.\" \"And so, Mr. Prestbury, it was a woman, but not the one so readily assigned to me by rumour, in con travention of all that was known of myself or my attachment,\" answered George, the very faintest tinge of bitterness showing through the lightness of his speech. \" Well, well, we're all liable to error, myself as well as the rest of people. I confess I was puzzled, having had a very different opinion of your matri monial views. But it's all right now, I suppose ; and I congratulate you on your good fortune. By the way, I was right enough in saying that sham Mr. Heywood was a ' wolf in sheep's clothing.' I never could get a second look at the fellow ; always kept out of my way. However I'd swear to that peppered back any where, if he hadn't a face to show. Know my own surgery! Now, I'm off; wont detain you longer! Oh, shall I call and tell Peover ?\""], [199, "AT LAST ! 191 George and Mr. Ford (who had stood by unable to edge in a word) looked at each other, as if questioning the prudence of this proposition. \" Ah, I see ; you think I'm too abrupt for so delicate a task ! Don't make a mistake ; the man who can feel a pulse, and see a patient's symptoms in his face, is fitter to carry tidings like these than a young fellow whose excitement and impetuosity would run at once to his subject, neck or nothing. No, no ! the surgeon can beat about the bush. A sudden shock might kill the old man. I shall call.\" \" Well, Mr. Prestbury, you will spare me a painful duty, if you do ; but I must own I was afraid lest the news of his nephew's arrest should come on him too suddenly,\" said George in reply. \"And thought yourself the only discreet messenger, eh ?\" added the surgeon, dryly. \" But I'm off at last ; dare say you wished me off long ago, Mr. Latham.\" And he stooped from his horse to whisper in George's ear, \" I think the wearer of a certain miniature is waiting for somebody in yonder room.\" And point ing over his shoulder, smiling and nodding, he rode away quickly to make up for lost time. Mr. Prestbury had so monopolized George Latham's attention, a silent shake of the hand had been his only recognition of Mr. Ford ; and now there was an"], [200, "192 god's providence house. uncomfortable pause, neither liking to be the first to name the subject foremost in his thoughts. The Grange had been a scene of bustle, excitement, and disorganization the whole morning. Men and women, attached or unattached to the premises, had been rushing to and fro in all directions at the call of curiosity or duty ; while Michael himself, sum- moned hither or thither, stopped at every turn for instructions or explanations, had scarcely been allowed a moment for reflection. Perhaps it was as well he had not. The whirlwind which had swept through his house, reversing and overturning all his plans, had carried him with it. What he had said or done had been on the spur of the moment ; he had no leisure to pause or deliberate ; and so, when Alice, hearing not only the first alarm, but the after confusion, the tramp of heavy feet in the corridor, and amongst others, a voice which floated to her ears like music in a dream, rose and came forth, disturbed and agitated, to inquire the cause of the extraordinary commotion, he answered her hastily, and without premeditation. \" What is the matter, child ! Rascality's the matter. The ghost is detected \u2014 and who do you think the infamous scoundrel is ?\" She leaned against the wall for support. Surely George Latham had not attempted, so disguised, to"], [201, "AT LAST! 193 approach her, and paid the penalty of rashness in discovery ! Seeing her faintness, though not divining the cause, he added, in a lower tone, in which shame and sorrow blended. \"Alice, Robert Heywood, whom I loved so well, has been the spectre haunting the Grange, and filling men's minds with horror.\" \" Robert Heywood !\" echoed Alice. \" Robert Hey wood ! Impossible !\" \" So I would have said last night. But he has deceived us all, child ; he is not even Mr. Heywood ! but a vile nephew of Mr. Peover's. His true name is Ned Bostock ; and his iniquities beyond your imagination.\" \" I thought \u2014 I imagined \u2014 I believed \" \u2014 faltered she. \" I heard the voice of \u2014 of \u2014 a \u2014 Mr. Latham ; but I must have been dreaming.\" \" You have quick ears, Alice. No, my girl, you were not dreaming. I am sorry to say I have been very un just to Mr. Latham ; and all through the scoundrel lying wounded by Dick's pickel in that room !\" (How very easy it is to shift all the blame from one's own shoulders to those of another delinquent ! Michael forgot that Mr. Heywood had simply worked upon the prejudice and obstinacy he found ready to his hand, or he quite ignored it). The dialogue between father and daughter oc- vol. iil 0"], [202, "194 god's providence house. curred at the very door of Mr. Heywood's room, and Ned Bostock groaned as every syllable spoken in that echoing corridor fell on his sensitive ear. \" Then, where is Mr. Latham ? and what brought him here ? What connection has he with Mr. Hey wood, or the ghost, or the ?\" \" One question at a time,\" interrupted Michael, as with clasped hands Alice poured forth her wondering queries. \" Come into the drawing-room, and I'll tell you all about it.\" The tears of Alice fell fast during the recital, but when it was ended she raised her head from the arm of the sofa, and clasping her arms round her father's neck, bestowed upon him a kiss and a loving embrace such as she had not given him for months. Michael was called away to Mrs. Ford, to break fast, to constables, then to Mr. Prestbury ; and Alice returned to her own room, with the intelligence that there would be \"no wedding to-morrow,\" intelligence not so acceptable to the disappointed bridesmaid as the well-pleased bride elect. Leaving Miss Bradley that morning to amuse her self at a tambour frame, Alice, restless and excited, wandered from parlour to kitchen, from kitchen to dairy, or to her mother's chamber, giving an order here, or arranging something there ; but remaining nowhere, until Mr. Prestbury caught a glimpse of"], [203, "AT LAST! 195 her morning-robe as he passed the open door of her little sitting-room. The embarrassing constraint following Mr. Prest bury's departure, was broken by inquiries respecting Ned Bostock, \u2014 wounds, warrants, et cetera, \u2014 until George, still in the entrance-hall, put the tremulous question, \" I trust Mr. Ford you have no longer any objection to my seeing your daughter?\" Alice's affectionate embrace in the drawing-room had warmed her father not only to a consciousness how nearly her happiness was linked with George Latham's, but how closely his own was inwoven with his child's ; the old confidence seemed at once restored, and so when he answered Mr. Latham, \" Not the slightest !\" and ushered him into his daughter's room, closing the door behind him, he was actuated by more than a desire to make reparation. He felt he was doing right, and his conscience said, \" Well done !\" How very different was Miss Ford's reception of the lover her father introduced then, than of the one for whom he opened the door a month earlier. There was no haughty repulse, no shrinking from his em brace ; she sprang to his clasping arms, raised her warm lips to his, and burying her face on his bosom, poured out the pent-up emotions of her heart in a flood of long-repressed tears. There was no fear of discovery, no dread of a father's anger, to cause o 2"], [204, "196 god's providence house. timidity or hesitation ; the sorrow they had under gone for each other had purified and sanctified their love, and she clung to him with all the tenderness and devotion of her nature. There were silent kisses, and whispered words of faith and love (though there was no one to overhear), and there was the compli cated web of Ned Bostock, or Robert Heywood, to unravel ; the story of her sufferings under persecution, $nd his under torture, were to be told, and mutual sympathy bespoken and expressed. Hours flew by, and still they sat, regardless of the time, or the constant shuffling of feet on the tiled pavement of the hall, until a more measured tramp of feet, and a suppressed noise outside, brought them to the window. On a hospital stretcher, attended by a guard of well-armed constables, Ned Bostock was borne from the Grange, for possession of which, together with the fair girl who watched his igno minious exit, he had plotted and sinned. Was it not a part of his punishment that when the descent of the steps brought his bearers to a lower level, he should see the half-glad, half-pitying face of Alice close to the proud one of George at the window, and hear \" What a likely young couple them are !\" ejacu lated by one of his guards ? What were the reflections of the miserable wretch, as he was carried along under the sunny sky, to the"], [205, "AT LAST ! 197 close chamber of the Pentice-court, where the magis trate and clerk of the Pentice, dispensed summary justice on drunkards and brawlers and petty offenders, consigning to the stocks or whipping-post at legal discretion ; and where preliminary depositions in cases of felony were taken, and warrants for committal to the gaoler's custody made out? What could he feel as Mr. Ford and Mr. Latham, on horseback, passed his litter together near the cross-roads ; and the latter said, \" It was here that I was shot down on Christmas Eve, and left for dead.\" Mr. Ford adding, \" What a hardened wretch that man must have been to ride straight to our house, smiling and unconcerned, with blood on his soul, and dare to pollute my child's pure lips with the kisses of an assassin ?\" He writhed in torture, not conscience stricken and penitent, but the torture of exasperation at failure. Had he but aimed at heart instead of head, had he but stayed to make sure his work, instead of riding off so confidently, this could not have happened. Dead men tell no tales ! Oh, that he had but killed him ! And what a fool he had been to spare a rival a second time ! Why did he not put him to death, or ship him off at once instead of keeping him with a mad infatuation, to rise a witness against him now ? And to think that cursed clod-hopper had disabled him from breaking out of"], [206, "198 god's providence house. prison when they got him there ! Everything was going so smoothly, too ? But for that d\u2014 d fellow with his pitchfork, all had gone well. Who could have expected a country lumpkin like Dick to turn assailant to a spectre ? But three more days and all had been secure: Latham on the sea, himself the husband of Alice, the Grange his own. What ill luck could have kept that infernal clown, with his cursed pitchfork, up till midnight ! If he only got off this time, he'd spoil that cock's crowing ! And Alice ! \u2014 Alice, whom he loved so passionately, would be given to that detested Latham ; would cling to him, smile upon him, love him ; and they would together exult over Robert Heywood's fall. Of all the bitter potion he had to swallow, those thoughts were the bitter dregs ; and as he vented his rage and spleen in muttered curses, he ground his teeth, and clenched his hands, till the shapely nails dug into the palms. Meanwhile his bearers trudged on \u2014 not at all too carefully \u2014 discoursing amongst themselves on the probability of his execution, with the indifference of men hardened in the service of gaol and gallows, regardless of the groans or imprecations of their prisoner. The day was far spent before the various indict ments were made out. George, as chief prosecutor, charging Ned Bostock, alias Robert Heywood, with"], [207, "AT LAST! 199 attempted assassination on the highway; also with forgery, with forcible kidnapping and illegal detention. Mr. Ford himself laid a charge of burglary against Ned Bostock, and a second of conspiracy to defraud against the said Ned Bostock, alias Robert Heywood. A lieutenant of the coastguard, entering as the chief prisoner was being removed, preferred a charge of \"smuggling run-goods and foreign merchandise, and being armed for the purpose,\" against Ned Bostock, alias Robert Heywood, John Tonks, and Luke Greenwood, otherwise Black Luke ; and against sundry persons, not in custody, for aiding and abetting.\" Against Black Luke and two others not in custody Mr. Ford laid his charge of \" highway robbery with violence ;\" and, as if no loop-hole for escape were to be left, Miles Wood rushed in out of breath, accom panied by Ralph Home, in time to record the several indictments of arson, robbery, and abduction against John Tonks ; Black Luke, alias Luke Greenwood, being aider and abettor in the abduction. A heavy charge-sheet against three individuals, substantiated by overwhelming evidence, so strong indeed, that on after consultation with William Hall, the Clerk of the Pentice, John Wright, the Mayor, and Foster Bower, the Recorder, it was considered unnecessary and unwise to excite the political feeling"], [208, "200 god's providence house. of the county, by entering the higher charge of treason and traitorous conspiracy. It was, moreover, deemed expedient that secret inquiries should be prosecuted, to ascertain whether the capture of the chief conspirator would lead to the dissolution of the confederacy, or whether a proxy remaining in the person of Jeffery Latham (whom it was judged advisable to secure), the seditious scheme would not spread and propagate. George Latham, not over anxious to leave home in the dawn of his regained happiness, nor yet too zealous for the arrest of his uncle Jeffery, urged that his disguise was known, and most of the smugglers proper were familiar with his features ; but he was willing to supply any information to assist an ap pointed person in the inquiry, and if the calls of justice absolutely demanded his presence in Man chester, he was at the service of the state. Followed by hooting boys and rough men and women, the prisoners, carefully guarded for fear of rescue, were removed from the Pentice-court in the old Exchange, hung round with portraits of the good or great, to the contracted cells and bare stone walls of the ancient gaol in the North Gate, so long inade quate to the requirements of the city and its criminals, or the rights of common humanity. Ned Bostock's wounds secured for him better accommodation than"], [209, "AT LAST! 201 his fellows ; and, at the desire of Mr. Peover, Mr. Prestbury continued to attend him, the gaol-surgeon being only too willing to obtain a temporary sub stitute. Mr. Ford and Mr. Latham turned their horses' heads down Watergate Street, and stopped at God's Providence House. They were equally sorry for the good old people, though Michael, being in his con fidence, felt that Ned's imprisonment would free the old man from the terror of his mysterious threats ; and however much he might be shocked by his excess of wickedness, suddenly revealed, or the fate awaiting his sister's son, a sense of relief must follow. Grave Margery opening the door, started at be holding in friendly companionship two whom she had known so long bitterly opposed to each other, but too discreet and well-trained to express an opinion of her own openly there, showed the visitors into the office, while she announced their arrival, contenting herself with quietly remarking that she was \" thankful Master George had escaped the perils which had beset him : the Lord had been merciful !\" Having duly announced their arrival, as she ushered them up stairs, Margery respectfully inti mated that \" if Master George could spare five minutes, she wished to speak with him before he lest ;\" and he, fully understanding the mother's yearning for intelli-"], [210, "202 god's providence house. gence of her lost child, however fallen, promised readily. Mrs. Peover had been reading aloud from a folio Bible laid on a snap-table, drawn to the light beneath the window, and on their entrance she rose, placed her spectacles as a book-mark, and turned to greet her visitors. Mr. Peover also quitted his seat by the fire, for which he apologised on the ground that old people soon felt chilly. After the first salutations and very hearty welcomes of George, Michael asked, \" Did Mr. Prestbury call here this morning ?\"' \" He did, he did !\" \" Were you not greatly shocked by his intelligence, godfather ?\" George enquired. \" Not so much as you wojild suppose, Mr. Latham. Joseph was partly prepared for evil tidings of Ned. All else was matter for thanksgiving,\" said Mrs. Peover, answering for her husband. \" What do you mean ?\" asked Michael. \" I do not understand you,\" said George, in a breath. \" Madam Latham was here a few days back ; told me she suspected Mr. Heywood and our Ned were all one ; that he had forged letters she knew ; was afraid he had murdered you, my boy \u2014 murdered you ! I suspected so too ; and to-morrow, the fifth of Sep tember \u2014 the fifth \u2014 on the very wedding-day, to make"], [211, "AT LAST! 203 sure, I purposed, God willing, to confront him, and if I found Mr. Heywood to be that rascal in disguise, denounce him myself.

Mrs. Ford, with her crutch, came forward to wel come George, which she did very kindly, but with moist eyes. She had been timid and nervous since her accident, the incidents of the day and night pre ceding had broken into her sleep and rest, and little things affected her. She had begun to regard Mr. Heywood as a member of the family, and seeing him through the medium of Michael's eyes, he shone with a glory not his own. Yet she had never got quite rid of a sort of undefinable feeling that the elegant gentleman was not altogether as acceptable to Alice as he ought to have been, and feebly regretted it, as a probable cause of continued strife and unplea santness. However, she was far from prepared for his sudden overthrow, still less for what she considered a very hasty adoption of another statue to fill his empty pedestal. But Margaret generally suffered matters to take their unquestioned course, and let others think for her, change of habit and association being the most"], [215, "AT LAST! 207 painful features in the present disruption of ties and arrangements. She therefore accepted Mr. Latham for her daughter, on the all-sufficient grounds that such was Michael's will \u2014 and he must have good reason for it \u2014 thankful that the family differences would be terminated so easily. Besides, she had always kept him in kindly remembrance ; and when she crossed the parlour floor to meet him, it was with perfect sincerity she answered his pleasant '\u2022 How do you do, Mrs. Ford ?\" with \" Better, thank you, Mr. Latham ; I am glad to see you, and looking so well.

Miss Ford will be the bond of peace, as she has ever been,\" continued he, sinking his voice so low as not to reach the ears of the disappointed bridesmaid at the tambour-frame. A faint pleased smile crossed Margaret's amiable face, and she answered as he supported her to her easy-chair \u2014 \" It is certainly gratifying to me, that Michael is"], [216, "208 god's providence house. reconciled to you at last, and that Alice may be allowed to please herself after all. It was so miser able to see the melancholy face of the poor thing all day over, you know. I was certainly not prepared for such a hasty change of Michael's opinions ; but he never does anything by halves, and what he thought right to do, he is sure to do at once ; or else this sudden transfer of Alice to you did surprise me a good deal. But, certainly, after the great shock and surprise we all had last night, or rather this morning, I ought not to be astonished at anything. Alice, my dear, Mr. Latham will join your father at his supper ; or perhaps, Mr. Latham, you would prefer tea. We have had our tea two hours, and Mr. Ford likes a substantial meal ; so we prepared supper, although it is barely six o'clock. Alice, make Mr. Latham a dish of tea.\" Alice would have made Mr. Latham anything he might have required; but he, caring more for her presence than aught either edible or drinkable, sat down to fare as Mr. Ford fared, and with quite as good an appetite, notwithstanding his love- fe ver.

Lanterns were provided, and the men examined their arms.

It was plain none of the band had dared to return. The lamps had gone out for lack of oil, but George pointed to an oil-cask, and they were relit. There were intricate passages and other vaults beyond those previously visited.

Whether destined for the use of the French in surgents, or as the nucleus of a store provided against home insurrection, they found no evidence there to show. But on the bed where the wounded man had been laid was picked up a small crimson glass lamp, shaped similarly to those in use for garden (or other) illumi nations ; it still contained a wick, and some little fluid \u2014 not oil. A metal rim, to which was attached a long sharp hook like a pin, completed the whole. Dick said it was fastened in front of the Grey Lady's dress, and though he had removed it, he forgot to mention the thing in the after confusion.

The lid had been wrenched open, and the few coins it had held were gone j but some papers remained, sufficient to prove beyond question the ownership of the whole. Exultingly Miles carried his prize to Michael, as proud of the opportunity to ex onerate Matthew as to convict John Tonks.

Had he known whither Matthew Spark had fled, so that he could have conveyed to him intelligence of acquittal from unjust suspicion, his satisfaction would have been complete ; as it was, he regretted that the smith had not stood his ground, in conscious rectitude, and braved the obloquy.

The tan-ta-ra-ta-ra of the post-boy's horn had wakened a chorus of children and curs as he passed through the village street, and aroused in more than womanly breasts that curiosity which is^always a light sleeper. He brought two letters \u2014 letters neither for parson nor curate, nor for either of the great houses, but for Miles Wood and Ralph Home ; and what set the villagers wondering more, was to see the former rush bareheaded up the street with the open letter in his hand. Miles found Ralph (who had ceased to be the jovial host) in a state of agitation equal to his own, vainly striving to decipher a letter which his blinding tears rendered illegible. The two men grasped each other by the hand, equally unable to utter a word, over mastering emotion visible in every lineament. \" Our Ph\u0153be is not lost, thank God !\" \" Thank God, moi lass is safe !\" burst simultaneously from the young man and the old one, alike involuntarily acknowledg ing with gratitude the beneficent Power which had"], [223, "jeffery Latham's friendship. 215 preserved the betrothed of the one, the daughter of the other. Both letters were from the missinor girl ; and while Miles read aloud to the publican that which he could not yet see to read for himself, let us glance over the one to Miles. It was a large sheet, and closely written, even to the folds under the wafer. \" Bristol, Aug. 26, 1791. \" My dear Friend, \" This comes, hoping to find you well, as it leaves me at present. I hope you have not fretted so very much about me, and have not thought so very badly of me as I am afraid you might, for indeed I could not help it \u2014 indeed, Miles, I could not ! I dare say you, and father, and madam, and everybody else, think I am very wicked, and have run off with Master George ; but indeed I did not, and never should have thought of such a thing. \" I own I have been very foolish and silly, Miles, but I hope and pray you will forgive me. I thought it was a fine thing to have Mr. Latham writing letters to me, and calling me so many fine names, such as charmer, and angel, and the like, that you never used at all, and writing so prettily of cupids, and flames, and darts. I daresay you found the letters after I was gone. But when I got the letter asking me to run away, I was so frightened I did not know"], [224, "216 god's providence house. what to do. I thought of coming and begging your pardon, for I knew I had behaved badly \u2014 and I wish I had now ; but then I thought there was no need for you ever to know how silly I had been ; and that I would just meet Mr. Latham and tell him I loved you and not him, and that I was sorry I had let him think I did. And oh, Miles, it was not Master George I met, and it was not Master George either that wrote the letters ; it was that nasty, ugly, wicked, cruel beast, John Tonks. He stuffed a nasty rag in my mouth, and carried me to a boat, and the boat went down the river, and then they \u2014 there were two other dread ful men \u2014 they covered my eyes ; and after that the boat seemed to go between two rocks, and then I was listed out, and when my eyes were uncovered I was in a great cave in the rock, quite a room. John Tonks laughed at my crying, and said I was to be his sweet heart ; and he was very rude, and would have been worse, but for a woman who was there. She is called Mally, and has been very kind to me. The men took the woman away with them, and left me alone in that dismal place. And oh, Miles, they came back again, after a very long time, and who should they bring with them but Master George ! with his hands tied behind him. And there, I dare say, he is now. And pray, Miles, ran and tell Madam Latham, for they are going to send him off to the West Indies for"], [225, "jeffery latham's friendship. 217 a slave, as soon as ever Miss Ford is married. And, please, go and tell Mr. Ford that Mr. Heywood is not a gentleman, but a very bad man ; it is him that is going to send Mr. Latham away ; and he is very cruel indeed to the good young gentleman. \" Two nights after (Master George's watch told us the time) Mally and me were forced into a boat and carried to a ship \" (every vessel with sails and a deck was a ship to Ph\u0153be) \" to be taken to France, where nobody would understand us, and we were to be kept safe there till after the wedding, and then John Tonks was to come after us, and I was to be given up to him : I would have torn his eyes out first, though. Oh, Miles, I have been dreadfully punished for trifling with your feelings; and Master George and Mally both said it served me right ; and I begin to feel as if it did. What with fretting and sea-sickness, with the rolling and tossing of the ship, and the fright I was in because of the horrid men we were with, and the bad language they used, I hardly know how the time went; but one day I found there was another ship chasing ours, Malley called it a revenue cutter ; and then there was a fight, and such dreadful work ; and then one of the sailors was going to blow up our ship, and then one of the other sailors, who had jumped on board, killed him almost, just as he wa3 going to fire a pistol into a barrel of gunpowder."], [226, "218 god's providence house. And, oh, was not that a narrow escape ? And who should the brave sailor be but Matthew Spark ; so much thinner, and so much older, I should not have known him. But he knew me, and seemed almost as thankful to have had the chance of saving me as I was to be preserved from the dreadful fate before me. Dear Miles, I owe a great deal to Matthew ; for when the revenue officers came on board, and would have treated us badly, as being the smugglers' companions, he told the captain who I was, and how I came there, and then they were very civil ; and now Mally and me are in Bristol, kept to appear as witnesses against the men who carried us off, who were smugglers. Matthew has lent me money to buy some clothes to wear, and to pay for what we want. \"We are staying at the Sedan Chair Inn, on Broad Quay ; and there we shall be till the assizes are over. Matthew says he could not bear to be suspected of burning your shed, and robbing you into the bargain, and so he carried off his things in the night, and sold them, and then turned sailor. I have written you a very long letter, and it has taken me a great while to write, not being used to write many letters. But I thought Miles, you would be more likely to forgive me, if I told you everything, and you saw it was really not all my fault ; and that I really did love you, Miles, even when I teased you, and plagued you, by pretending I"], [227, "jeffery latham's friendship. 219 did not. I only did it to see how you would take it ; and then when I found you were really angry, I was afraid to own I had only done it for fun. I will never, never, plague you again Miles, if you will only take me back to your heart this time, for I do love you, really. I hope you will get this letter time enough to set Mr. Latham free, but I am afraid not, as I am told it will have to go all the way to London before it is sent to Chester. I have not paid the postage, because 1 did not think it was right to use Matthew's money to pay for my letter to you. I have asked father to send me money to pay him back. Please to tell father all that I have not said to him that he ought to know, because I could not write two such very long letters in one day. Give my love and duty to your mother, and do please to tell her I am not as bad as I seem, and I must now conclude Your very sincere friend, \"Ph\u0153be Horne.\" Very sincere and hearty were the thanksgivings of both father and lover, that the wayward, but innocent girl had been spared the misery which had threatened her. Much that her letter contained was already known. Mr. Latham was at liberty, and Mr. Hey wood in durance ; but Miles, in the first flush of grati tude and joy, hastened to show Ph\u0153be's letter, first"], [228, "220 god's providence house. to Madam Latham (calling at home for his hat, and to tell his mother), next to Mr. Ford. Madam Latham and her son were at the Grange ; but of course, as generally happens, he took the unnecessary journey first. Mr. and Mrs. Peover were also there by invitation, and the Rev. Mr. Gres ham, who, with Miss Bradley, were the only additions to the party who had assembled in that drawing-room to welcome Michael home, nine months before. Very unwillingly Miles obeyed a summons up stairs, not from clownish bashfulness \u2014 that had passed away, as education and association expanded his intellect, aud gave him confidence in his powers \u2014 but from that new feeling of respectability which kept his working garb for wear within the working sphere. His best suit was no longer kept exclusively for Sunday use; he dressed as beseemed his ad vancing business, his advanced condition. He was called \" proud \" by his neighbours, but that did not affect him ; he was rising above them rapidly. Peggy however came to his relief, found him water and a jack towel, and having washed away the traces he fancied his labour left behind, he carried up-stairs the letter he had had from Ph\u0153be. He had no mind however, to make her letter quite so public ; he gave it to Madam Latham to peruse, to George, and then to Mr. Ford, since there was"], [229, "jeffery latham's friendship. 221 matter in it which affected them, and on Mrs. Latham's suggestion it was handed to the curate, as it placed Matthew Spark in a new, and more pleasing light \u2014 and Ph\u0153be too. Miles had felt so bitterly the stigma on Ph\u0153be, that he was proud beyond measure of this opportunity to prove her better than she was thought. The party reading the letter had grouped round Madam Latham's chair, to discuss it, apart from the others. \" W^ell, Miles,\" said Mr. Ford, \" I suppose you will write to the poor girl now, and say you forgive her ; you will not be very obdurate after that peni tent letter ?\" (Michael had grown wonderfully liberal in a very short time). \" I don't know about writing sir,\" answered Miles doubtfully. I thought, as I was coming along, it would be as well if \" \"Why, Miles,\" pleadingly interrupted Alice, who had crept round to George's side, and overlooked as he read,\" you surely cannot mean to cast off Ph\u0153be after that candid confession ; her punishment has been quite great enough already.\" \" You misunderstand me, Miss Ford ; I have no ill feeling towards Ph\u0153be : at the very worst I \"thought she had been tempted and beguiled by a gentleman of finer parts and manners than myself; and,"], [230, "222 god's providence house. begging Mr. Latham's pardon. I blamed him more than the poor lass.\" \"Yes, Miles,\" said Madam Latham. \" Even- one but Mr. Gresham joined in the outcry against my son ; I found no one willing to listen to reason.\" \" Hush, mother,\" remonstrated George, in an undertone ; they did listen to the only reason they had \u2014 the specious reasons my wily foe had prepared. You must not blame those who thought me the sinner. How could they do otherwise ?\" The discourse was drifting towards an uncomfort able point for Michael, so he recalled the original topic, saying \u2014 \" Then you intend writing at once, I conclude.\" \"No, Mr. Ford, I have been thinking that it might be as well if I went to Bristol myself, instead. I should get there almost as soon as a letter, and a young girl like Ph\u0153be is not fit to be left without a protector amongst rough sailors in a sea-port town. Matthew means well, no doubt ; but he may involve her in some drunken brawl or other, damaging to her reputation.\" \"I should imagine, Miles, that Ph\u0153be's father would be the proper person to go for his child,\" said Madam Latham, with calm reserve. \" It would scarcely be decorous for her to remain in Bristol or travel home in your charge, although you are engaged,"], [231, "jeffery latham's friendship. 223 and you a steady man. The child is sufficiently compromised already.\" \" I have thought of that, Madam, but Mr. Home is old ; the journey is long, and he little used to travel ; so if he gives his consent, I will go, take with me necessary clothes for her use, and marry her when 1 get to Bristol. We have already been asked in church ; and I daresay the Parson or Mr. Gresham\" (and Miles bowed to that gentleman) \" can give me a paper of some kind, that I can show to a clergyman there, to prove we are at liberty to be married to each other lawfully.\" \" That is somewhat irregular Miles ; but however, I will see what can be done, as your motive is a worthy and noble one,\" said Mr. Gresham. \" Well sir, I made up my mind as I came here ; for I thought that the neighbours might cast up to the girl that she had done something unbecoming ; and that if I went for her, and brought her back as my wife I should silence malicious tongues. No one would dare to speak ill of the girl my pious mother accepted as a daughter.\" \" Bravely spoken, my man ; you are a worthy fellow, and I hope Ph\u0153be will make you a good wife, and a steady one. I think she has had a sufficient lesson,\" exclaimed Michael, grasping Miles 's hand. \"I know she has had a lesson, and one she will"], [232, "224 god's providence house. never forget. I saw her in her trouble, and know her story to be genuine, and her repentance sincere,\" said George. \" Ph\u0153be will not make the worse wife for the humiliation she has undergone, believe me !\" Miles did believe it, and on the strength of that belief, waited on his principal employers, desiring that such work they did not care to entrust to his man, might be held over until his return from a long but necessary journey. Further, he obtained from Mr. Gresham a list of the principal towns through which lay his nearest route, as well as the desired documents ; and, mounted on a good horse offered by George Latham, as fitter for the journey than Ralph Home's old hack, he set off with the good wishes of the whole community. As he carried money concealed about him (partly provided by Ralph), Michael, furnished him with pistols to pro- tect it, if necessary ; but he kept to the turnpike roads, stopping only to sleep or bait as he passed through Whitchurch, Shrewsbury, Church-Stretton, Ludlow, \"Worcester, Tewkesbury, and Gloucester, arriving safely at Bristol on the fourth day. Mally was far from the best companion a pure girl could have had ; but she had never been wholly de praved, and now felt the contrast between herself and Ph\u0153be very keenly. Urged by contrition and anxi ety for the boy she had left behind in Chester, and by"], [233, "jeffery latham's friendship. 225 a desire to revenge herself in thwarting Ned Bostock's plans, she too had written home to the mother she had not addressed for years, a contrite penitent letter, and waited anxiously a reply, when Miles Wood rode up to the door of the Sedan Chair, and inquired for Miss Home. So utterly self-abased and unworthy his manly love did Ph\u0153be feel, that instead of rushing to meet him she hid her face in her apron and sobbed out right. Mally, like a sensible woman, withdrew, and Miles, drawing the weeping girl to him, endeavoured to console her. \" Ph\u0153be, my love, I have not come to reproach you,\" he whispered in a thick voice. \" I have come to make you my wife, if you will have me, that I may have a right to protect you, not only here, or in an overfacing court, or on your home journey, but through life.\" \" Oh, Miles, Miles, I did not deserve this goodness,\" sobbed she between her tears, \"I have been so vain, and wilful, and perverse, and brought all this on myself with my own folly ; and, oh, Miles, how can you ever forgive me ; I am ashamed to look you in the face.\" \" Hush, Ph\u0153be, my lass, that is all past now ; it has been for the best, I dare say. But dry your eyes and kiss me, or I shall think you are not glad to see vol. hi.

They were duly married at Redcliffe church, Mally and a messmate of Matthew's being the only wit nesses, Matthew holding aloof, and getting maudlin drunk in his anguish. He had shaken hands with Miles, acknowledged he was fitter for Ph\u0153be's husband than himself; but when it came to the pinch, he stole away to drown his sorrow in drink. Miles had taken a respectable lodging in Mary-le port street, whither Mally accompanied them ; Miles, grateful for her protective kindness to Ph\u0153be in time of distress and danger, not casting her adrift for what she had been, but sheltering her in hope of what she might yet become. In this lodging (removed from the rough scenes of a quay-side tavern), they awaited the coming trial ; Miles very anxiously, since he could"], [235, "JEFFERY LATHAM'S FRIENDSHIP. 227 not be both in Gloucester and Chester at once, and unless the assize court opened earlier at the former than the crownmote court at the latter place, he would be compelled to leave his bride to endure the browbeating of the prisoner's counsel,\" without the support of his presence, since he ?7iust appear against John Tonks. It was most desirable that Ph\u0153be and Mally should be in Chester also, their evidence being irrefragable against the three in custody there. Michael had foreseen this difficulty, however. Neither prosecutor spared his private purse, and the crown lawyers contrived to defer the Chester causes and expedite the Gloucester trials, special messengers outstripping tardy posts to make the requisite arrangements. The day before the assizes Miles removed to Gloucester, having spent the interval in pleasant rambles with his little wife around the neighbourhood of Bristol, along the banks of the Avon, to the Hot Wells, Clifton, and St. Vincent's Rock, printing on his own mind in indelible characters all that was most attractive or noteworthy. After a sojourn of two days at the Red Lion, in Lower Barton Street, where Matthew Spark had joined them like a singed moth, they were at liberty to depart, for the trial was over. The evidence was complete and conclusive.

Life might not have been of as much value seventy years back as now, for, though the population was far less dense, law and justice thinned it every assize. The five men were condemned to be hanged, but whether the extreme penalty of the law was carried out on all, or sentence commuted, our friends did not remain to see. Most likely it was. They heard Matthew commended for the prompti tude and bravery which had saved so many lives, and also a recommendation that so efficient a seaman should be promoted ; but when he shook hands with them at the door of the post-chaise and bade them \" good-bye,\" with red eyes and a husky voice, abso lutely refusing repayment of the money he had advanced, it was a last farewell. It is to be hoped that time, the consoler, in the midst of his stirring life, would smooth down the sharp anguish of disappointed love, better than the false remedy he tried. The White Glove, which, according to ancient usage, was suspended at St. Peter's Church, Chester High Cross, fourteen days before the fair commenced (and till its conclusion, either in allusion to the staple"], [237, "JEFFERY LATHAM'S FRIENDSHIP. 229 trade of the city, or as a challenge to peaceful compe tition), had swung there full three weeks, and the fan was at its height when the travellers returned. The Michaelmas fair had called together as usual, a motley populace from all England and North Wales, the city halls were filled with merchants and traders, the streets with booths and stalls, and the leave-looker went his rounds to preserve the city privileges, and gather leave-looking toll for \" leave \" to non-freemen to sell their wares during the twenty-nine days that peaceful token hung out. But Cardwell and Heywood's firm sent no open representative. It might be that Mr. Jeffery Latham, under a new name and a fresh disguise, pursued his vocation ; and really there was a very staid-looking quaker with formal phiz, quaint garb, and remarkably broad-brimmed hat, who might have been that individual, since he had more than once left his stall in Foregate Street to the care of another broad brim, whilst he visited the old gaol in the North-gate, influenced, as he said, by a pious regard for the moral and spiritual welfare of the prisoners generally, Ned Bostock and his associates in particular. Besides, he was observed to peer furtively from under his broad brim through the windows of the chaise at Mally, as, after passing under the East-gate, it threaded its way amongst men, women, children, horses, vehicles."], [238, "230 god's providence house. sedans, and stalls, down Foregate Street to the High Cross, and turned with difficulty into the throng of Northgate Street, impeded at every step until it passed out under the narrow-pointed under arch of the old North-gate, and soon was free of the crowd and bustle of the busy city. Was there no mysterious or sympathetic thrill to warn the prisoners in the frowning gaol overhead that the rumbling wheels they might faintly hear brought hither accusers they blindly deemed safely disposed of in an alien land ? If John Tonks, in his coarse brutality, was impenetrable, did no shudder run through the frame of Edward Bostock as Mally (the woman he had deceived with a mock marriage, kept as his paramour, and cast off in the end to be the prey of a lower ruffian), was borne beneath the walls of his prison, to appear against him and testify to all his evil deeds? If, in the common room where ordinary prisoners herded together in vile communion, there was drink ing, gaming, laughter, noise, and riot, the reckless efforts of brutalized minds and seared consciences to distract the thoughts of the less hardened, and keep their own wild spirits up \u2014 if men like John Tonks and BlackT^uke were depraved enough to jest and blaspheme under the very shadow of the gallows, surely Edward Bostock, the gentleman by education"], [239, "JEFFERY LATHAM'S FRIENDSHIP. 231 and frequent residence in Paris, the man who ruled his followers by dint of superior mental capacity and acquirements \u2014 surely he, kept apart as much from the nature of his crimes as his wounds, must in his loneli ness have thought, and deeply too, of the wrongs he had inflicted, and the need for repentance ! He did think of the wrongs he had inflicted, and might in the face of his coming trial have thought of them with remorse, but an evil spirit, in quaker garb, drove back his better angel, bade him look forward to vengeance, and held out visionary hopes of acquittal, of escape, of rescue even at the gallows' foot, and, as he listened, his penitent feelings faded away, and he strengthened himself with the prospect of evil work yet to be accomplished. Tools had been lest with him to facilitate escape, but the constable of the gaol was a vigilant man, and, it followed, his underlings were vigilant likewise ; the prison was not an ordinary one, and the first attempt being frustrated, he was fettered and watched even more carefully than before. Still he hoped for rescue on his way to or from the court, or failing that, even under the fatal tree. Under charter from Henry VIII. the City of Chester was created a county within itself, with special and peculiar privileges, immunities, laws, and government ; whilst the ancient Pentice, Crownmote, and Portmote courts were confirmed. The Pentice,"], [240, "232 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Appentice, or Penthouse court (so called because the original building in which it was held was annexed like an excrescence to the wall of St. Peter's church, with open sides, so constructed as to command a view of the High Cross, Bull-ring, and the four intersecting main streets) was held daily, and presided over by the mayor and sheriffs, arrayed in \" purple robes welted with velvet.\" Here they tried petty offenders, and the clerk took depositions in higher criminal cases, and entered all notices of actions. The jurisdiction of the Portmote and Crownmote courts, is indicated by their names, mote being an old Saxon word signifying court. The Portmote court was held by the mayor every Monday fortnight, but with that we have nothing to do, as it deals with civil pleas. The Crownmote court had three general sittings held thrice a year, in April, August, and October, and there tried all criminals excepting traitors, the mayor presiding, the recorder passing sentence of death, and having power to respite at pleasure. There was in old time a mote bell used to summon the court ; a custom retained bj the ringing of a small bell in St. Peter's Church when the mayor and recorder enter. The October court sat ; the day for the trial of Ned Bostock and his accomplices arrived ; the mote bell rang; the mayor, scarlet-robed, attended by his"], [241, "JEFFERY LATHAM'S FRIENDSHIP. 233 sword-bearer, mace-bearer, and sergeants with their sdver maces, the recorder, in long purple gown, and bearing a white wand in his hands, passed slowly up the stairs of the old Exchange to the court-room already crowded with strangers, counsel, lawyers, and the riffraff hangers on the legal skirts ; the witnesses were kept at hand in an adjoining room. Then came the two sheriffs, also purple gowned, and bearing white staves, escorting the prisoners (as by their tenure bound), from the gaol to the court, and the trials commenced, Edward Bostock, alias Robert Heywood, being first arraigned at the bar. He was the dainty gentleman even there \u2014 some thing less jaunty perhaps than heretofore, but equipped as carefully as though a ball and not a trial had dic tated his costume. At first he glanced hurriedly and with visible tremor round the court, fearing to en counter the form of Alice, but finding she was absent, he breathed more freely, and as his eye in its range took in the figure of his quaker-friend, shrouded by his broad-brim, he became more self-possessed, his eye glittered with something of its old light, whilst a visible smile of satisfaction played for a moment over his handsome features. As the trial proceeded, and one count after another was disposed of, as witness after witness appeared against him, his composure vanished, and he became restless, taking frequent pinches of"], [242, "234 god's providence house. snuff, and playing nervously with the heavy bunch of seals hanging from his watch-chain. Whilst minor witnesses were examined he remained cool ; Dick, Mr. Prestbury, and Michael, came and went, and even old Mr. Peover, falteringly and reluctantly, identified the stolen tools without visibly affecting him ; but when George Latham came forth, his teeth set, his nostrils dilated, and his hand gripped with an expression of fierce passion frightful to behold. Mally was last called. As she entered the witness-box, he started \u2014 what ill-wind had blown that woman there? Had his luck at last deserted him ? Was there indeed a Providence, as his uncle Peover thought ? Had his sin indeed found him out, and the very means he had taken for security been his doom ? \u2014 he grew livid, his lips twitched, as questions like these suggested them selves to his mind during the progress of the exami nation \u2014 then dizzy, and grasped at the bar before him to steady himself. Mally never looked towards him : he was the lover of her youth ; she had long believed him the husband of her womanhood. He was the father of her son ; and though by his last act he had severed every tie between them, she dared not look upon his treach erous yet handsome face, lest her purpose should waver. Her eye, however, seemed fascinated by the demure"], [243, "JEFFERY LATHAM'S FRIENDSHIP. 235 quaker before her ; but while she dived into the waters of memory, he, liking not her scrutiny, or fearing its result, quietly sidled behind another spec tator, and so out of the court, which he felt likely to become too warm for comfort. He was possibly unaware of the extraordinary privilege granted by Earl Lupus to the abbot and convent of St. Werburgh, when he established Chester Fair \u2014 a grant forbidding the arrest of any criminal resorting to the fairs, for any crime ivhatever, excepting such as they might commit during the fair itself. Or supposing him versed in local, immunities and privileges, Jeffery Latham shrewd and cunning, as any quaker real or feigned, might not dare to trust his safety to a worn out charter. When Mally retired, the mayor, as judge, reviewed the heads of the case, carefully noted down for him by the clerk of the Pentice \u2014 or in this case, the Crownmote \u2014 and summed up so clearly against the \u2022prisoner, that the jury with barely a whispered consult ation, gave their unanimous verdict \u2014 \" Guilty.\" The Recorder then emphatically and solemnly performed his painful dut}-, and passed the repulsive sentence, that he \" was to be hanged by the neck until he was dead.\" The doomed gentleman was removed to make way for his followers, who being only common ruffians, attracted less attention, and were placed at"], [244, "236 god's providence house. the bar, tried and sentenced to the same awful doom, without any of the sympathetic murmurs which had thrilled through the crowd when the white-faced, white-lipped beau bowed to the judge on retiring. Neither John Tonks, nor Black Luke, had rec koned on the evidence against them. The former thought the arson could not be proved, even when the chemical matches and broken box were produced ; but the appearance of Ph\u0153be, shivering and trembling with affright (she remembered the cross- questioning at Gloucester), and afterwards Mally, astounded him not less than his companion. Black Luke maintained a dogged demeanour throughout the whole trial for highway robbery; but John Tonks, snarled, showed his tusks, foamed at the mouth, and swore at the witnesses, counsel, and judges with terrible im precations, becoming so violent, he had at last to be pinioned by the gaolers for security. Sentence passed, the sheriffs (John Johnson and Peter Wilkinson) resumed their charge of the now condemned felons, and attended by the strong guard who had the actual care of the prisouers through the crowded streets, amidst the hisses and hootings of the mob to the door of the North-gate prison, where they resigned their tTust to the constable. The horrid dungeon known as the \"Dead Man's Hole,\" used as the condemned cell, being too small"], [245, "JEFFERY LATHAM'S FRIENDSHIP. 237 to contain the three, John Tonks and Black Luke were confined in another close at hand, carefully ironed by the neck, waist, hands, and feet, and chained to the floor. Not that there was much chance of even the most clever desperado breaking out of those depths ; but, it was customary so to iron condemned felons, and custom becomes as stringent as law. Ned Bostock, \" by merit raised to that bad emi nence,\" was placed for security in that more barbarous receptacle, there to remain fettered and manacled until the morning of execution. It was in vain he offered to bribe the gaolers to place him elsewhere, they had not a third equally strong room to keep him in, save the still more objectionable chamber of Little Ease ; so in spite of all remonstrances, the door was closed upon him, and he was left to his reflections. All three were now restricted to the ordinary prison dietary \u2014 namely, a pennyworth of coarse bread, and a pitcher of not very inviting water, daily, until the day appointed for execution, in this case the 20th October. A skilful application of golden ointment to the keeper's palm, procured the admission of Ebenezer Croft, the quaker, to the cells of these \"miserably benighted men,\" whom he was called by the spirit to exhort and admonish ; and a further application of the same invaluable panacea, convinced the keeper it"], [246, "238 god's providence house. was requisite these ministrations should be performed in private. The comfort brought by their friend was, as before, a promise of rescue on the way to the gallows, and small files to loosen their fetters ; and the exhortation was a strict injunction to avoid confession, lest it should prevent the assemblage of the gang in force sufficient to effect their freedom. The same argu ments differently dressed were administered alike to the three, and so artfully, that only one of them doubted their worthy friend Ebenezer. The gaoler was not quite so abundant in faith, he remembered a former occasion ; and having- locked the pious visitor out, returned to the cells, where he soon discovered the secreted files, and removed them even before their efficiency had been tried. If anything could subdue the untameable spirits of these wild and lawless men, surely that hideous state of captivity was calculated to do it. But' the two beguiled their time, not with preparations for the world to which they were hastening, but with plans and schemes, and hopes to cheat the hangman, and return to their old haunts, companions, and crimes ; deceived by the promises of Jeffery Latham, whose only object was to restrain them from making con fessions liable to implicate himself and cause his"], [247, "JEFFERY LATHAM'S FRIENDSHIP. 239 arrest, which would materially interfere with his own private plans for self aggrandisement, and a life of pleasure abroad. Ned Bostock in his loathsome cell had leisure for thought and reflection, undisturbed by sight or sound. The profound stillness, broken only by the clank of his own fetters, as he moved from one uneasy posture to another, or shrank from the slimy reptiles crawling round him, was only equalled by the intense darkness and cold, more deepened and intensified by the life of Sybarite ease, indulgence, and luxury he had led for many years. He had not altogether the perfect reliance on Jeffery Latham his rough followers had ; he knew him for a thoroughly heartless and selfish man, who only kept faith when it was to his own interest to be honest ; and as he could not see any special advantage to accrue to his partner from his rescue, now their schemes were exploded, he felt hope n that quarter slight indeed. He contrasted his situation then with that he had occujned at the Grange, only a month before, and cursed his folly in playing the ghost when the necessity was past, as the cause of all the mischief which had be fallen him. Still more did he reproach himself with the infatuation which had kept George Latham in the cavern, to feed his blind revenge. But supposing he had been disposed of, might he not have returned as"], [248, "240 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Mally had done, by one of those unforeseen chances which defeat all calculation\u2014 one of those turns in the wheel of fortune which shake a man off his legs in an instant. And then came the maddening thought over all, that Alice would be given to his exulting rival, and on him bestow the smiles and love for which Robert Heywood had sighed in vain. Pictures of their happiness floated before his eyes sleeping or waking, mingled with his fancies and emotions, and wrung his soul to torture, as one day followed another in the same unvarying monotony of darkness, silence, and self-reproach. The chaplain visited him, and the Rev. Mr. Gresham, exhorting to repentance and confession, and lest with the belief he was utterly hardened and impenetrable. But after they were gone soli tude and darkness effected a change. He began to think it possible that Providence and not ill-luck had wrought his defeat, to see that justice had been tracking him down, that every prosperous sin had collapsed at once, and let him down to a depth whence he could never rise. Even the political schemes by which he had hoped to shine forth as a leader of the people, the ruler of a revolution corre sponding with that in France, were suspected and discovered ; yet they were not wholly annihilated ; aud if Latham were but true and created a riot"], [249, "jEFi\"ERY latham's friendship. 241 amidst which they might escape, still he might succeed and wreak his vengeance on those who hail thus tortured him. If he were true ! Ah! If? A chaos of thought and emotion succeeded as repent ance, hope of escape, and doubt swayed by turns ; then followed a dread of a judgment beyond the finite decision of an earthly court, and for the first time for many years he tried to pray. There had always been an oppression on his chest, and a difficulty of breathing in his narrow cell, arising from the impurity of the atmosphere ; the pipes which supplied from the street the only fresh air admitted being very insufficient for the purpose. But now, even as that imperfect prayer ascended, the air became more than ever fetid and stifling, a leaden weight seemed to crush in his chest, rendering breath ing almost impossible ; heavier grew the weight, closer the atmosphere, the blood rushed to his brain, the fair face grew livid, the hands clenched rigidly, he gasped in insufferable agony, the eye-balls started, and the blackened lips gaped. The corse of a suffo cated man fell forward into the keeper's arms, when, the next morning, he opened the cell door to summon its inmate to prepare for the gallows ! There was a hurried rushing to and fro in the goal, an anxious consultation; justice had been defeated, the gallows had been robbed \u2014 but how ? This re- VOL. III. R"], [250, "242 god's providence house. mained an unsolved puzzle. At first it was conjec tured the prisoner bad committed suicide by stopping the air pipes with his handkerchief; but this was found to be a fallacy, and not until the North-gate was taken down, some sixteen years later, was any other solution offered to the enigma than that he had died from a fit of apoplexy. But the workmen pulling down the old pile, found a mass of rags and wool stuffed into the pipes where they opened to the street ; and one man recalling the circumstance of Ned Bostock's death, from the disappointment of the sight-seeing crowd, suggested that it had been the work of a confederate. He was not far from the mark, the quiet quaker loitering about the gaol, after dark, had contrived to suffocate his friend unseen and unsuspected, as surely as though he had wound his fingers round the throat, or planted a knee upon the heaving chest. And then he rode away, chuckling to think how cleverly he had disposed of an unpleasant possibility. Even the fast falling snow caused him no dread of detection, for the flakes obliterated footmarks soon as formed. Nor did the snow interfere with the excitement attendant on an execution. Gallows Hill was crowded before sunrise. The streets were lined with people to watch the procession pass from the goal to Glover's stone, and the constable there formally resign his"], [251, "243 JEFFERY LATHAM'S FRIENDSHIP. prisoners to the two sheriffs, who were bound to see the criminals executed. Thence the crowd closed in behind the cart and the guard, and hissing, hooting, pelting with dead rats and other pleasant missiles, diversified the scene. Seated in the black cart with their coffins before them, and halters round their necks, still heavily fettered rode the two men, one black and sullen, with head hung down, casting his eyes over the crowd anxiously; the other, John Tonks, alternately swearing and muttering unseemly jests. As the cart neared the ominous-looking tree, Black Luke started up, jumped out over the heads of the people, amongst the crowd which made way for him, and rolling down the steep declivity along a gutter way to the Dee, leaped into the river, hoping to save himself by swimming to a boat, in which Ebenezer Croft and another quaker sat to watch the proceed ings. He \"was a powerful man, and a good swimmer; but had miscalculated the overpowering weight of his irons, which sent him down to the bottom without a chance to rise to the surface. This was so sudden, so unlooked for, no effort was made to arrest his progress, and the man was drowned before the spectators had recovered from their surprise. The blinding snow which intercepted the view contri buted to this ; but soon there was a stir amongst the R 2,"], [252, "244 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. guard and the officials. The sheriffs were answer able for the due execution of the criminals confided to them, and for their safe custody. Rewards were offered, and divers found, who (attended by a boat) with ropes and hooks searched the swollen stream for the weighted body. After a time it was recovered, and such was the literal justice of the period, that the dead body was hanged up side by side with the living man, who had been kept waiting in the cart until it was found. Even then John Tonks, coarse and brutal, jested and swore by turns, his last words, \" How nice and tight my new cravat fits,\" being spoken as the cart was drawn away, and, swinging by the side of his drowned comrade, he expiated a long course of crime, unrepentant and unmoved."], [253, "AFTER ALL ! 245 CHAPTER X. AFTER ALL! Neither Michael Ford nor George Latham joined the gaping mob assembled on Gallows Hill to see the executions. The same delicacy which kept Alice out of the crowded court, lest she should add by her presence to the poignancy of their late guest's defeat, prevailed to deter her father and lover from witness ing the final scene. George was too chivalrous to exult over a fallen foe, however guilty ; and Michael could not bring himself to look upon the ignominious death of one he had loved and regarded almost as his son, and around whom the tendrils of meinorj yet clung and drooped mournfully. Smarting with anger and irritation at the wrongs he had endured and inflicted, as the dupe of the con summate villain ; doubly exasperated by the irre-"], [254, "246 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. parable injury done to his amiable little wife ; and incensed to think how nearly he had sacrificed his only child in consequence of his arts, he felt a grim satisfaction in surrendering to justice the plotter against his domestic peace, and gave his evidence accordingly. But when the aggravated nature of his offences drew down on Ned Bostock the extreme penalty of the law, he remembered, like an Arab, that the criminal, vile as he was, had \" eaten salt with him ;\" and though no feeling of compunction came across his resolute mind, he could not behold his end. Consequently, at the conclusion of the trial, Jdichael volunteered to accompany George Latham to Manchester, with a view to exterminate the baud of smugglers, robbers, and plotters, of whom Jeffery Latham was the remaining head. The young man had no great liking for his task, for though he felt the force of Mr. Ford's argument that there was no security either for his own life or property whilst Jeffery Latham remained at large, his reluctance to assist in the couviction of his uncle, and so drag the family name through the mire, was most palpable. Michael did not share his sentiment by any means. For more than twenty years he had regarded that Latham as the foe of his wife's family, the cause of ruin to her inheritance; and the impression had"], [255, "AFTER ALL! 247 deepened with time. He further inclined to the belief that Mr. Peover's nephew had originally been led astray more by the subtle mind of Jeffery Latham, than the ill-disposed idler Black Luke : at all events, his later villanies placed the partners on a par, as masters to scheme and plot ; whilst such men as the sometime paviour, and the cunning locksmith, followed, admired, and obeyed the greater rascals at humble distance, as servants only. So Michael urged Mr. Latham on, proposed to bear him company, and after a little family consulta tion (for Michael was less self-assertive than hereto fore), and some very tender leave-takings, both with old and young people, they took horse for the town of spindles and spinning-jennies. Mr. Newton had been communicated with imme diately after the arrest of the delinquents, and he again had put the Manchester boroughreeve's men on the scent. But the deputy-constable was friendly to Mrs. Snow, and Mrs. Snow was friendly to the firm in Meal Street ; consequently no reckless haste had been displayed to break up a profitable business, in which they had, perhaps, a mutual interest. When George Latham and Michael made their appearance, armed with a Hue-and-Cry from the Crownmote Court, the case assumed a different"], [256, "248 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. aspect. There was blood-money to be won, and vigilance became a virtue. In a new disguise (to guard against mischance) George visited Rook Street Chapel. There he saw the well-remembered faces of men who had lingered to exchange words or signs with Robert Heywood ; but now they whispered together mysteriously, and slunk away as if they felt their cause was in danger, and themselves too. At night they haunted the old rendezvous more cautiously than before ; and one of the ringleaders, with a pass-key, admitted the rest. Instructed in the signal by George Latham, the boroughreeve's men tapped at door and shutter; the former was opened, and the officers rushed in in a body. Instantly the lights were extinguished, the lanterns struck from the officers' hands; there was a scuffle \u2014 a fierce fight \u2014 in which the constables, who knew nothing of the place, or the desperate men they dealt with, had decidedly the worst. In the dark it is not easy to distinguish friends from foes ; and many a hard knock, designed for the head of a conspirator, fell on the sconce of a peace-officer. In the midst of the confusion, it occurred to Mr. Gradon that the number of combatants thinned. He shouted an order to a man outside to bring a light, and guard it ; when it came, constable was struggling"], [257, "AFTER ALL! 249 with constable ; one or two lay helpless on the floor, but the conspirators were gone ! Very foolish these valiant men looked ; they had been fighting with each other, while the men they intended to secure had slipped out of their hands and disappeared, whither they could only conjecture. The man left on the watch at the stair-head averred no one had passed him ; but a diligent search in a second and third store-room, showed an open window and lifted shutter, beyond the range of the dull oil-lamp. It was no use attempting to follow. All that could be done was to place a padlock on the door, leave men in charge, and return in the morning with a fresh warrant, to search for stolen or contraband goods. These were found in abundance : amongst the rest several pieces of fustian, identified as the property of a gentleman whose warehouse had been broken into and robbed some months before. Mr. Latham remembered the heavy packs borne in by Black Luke, and also that Mrs. Snow had examined similar goods by the light at the open doorway. He pro duced the letter, which suggested Mrs. Snow's com plicity ; and notwithstanding Mr. Gradon's protest against these imputations on a most respectable and wealthy tradeswoman, the boroughreeve thought proper to grant a search-warrant, and the deputy-"], [258, "250 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. constable received a hint to remain where he was, whilst it was put in force. If the horeshoes nailed over every door of Mrs. Snow's house and warehouse sufficed to keep out evil spirits, they were not potent to keep out con stables who came \" in the king's name,\" to execute a search-warrant. Purple grew Mrs. Snow's red face, then changed to a livid mottle, as the officers wan dered over her extensive premises, poking sticks under rags, and bones, and old metal, and turning up concealed stores in all directions. The grim looking woman -servant, acting on a look from her mistress, had cleared the wardrobe whilst they were occupied in the warehouse, and placed the tell-tale treasures hodge-podge under a moveable plank in the room floor, so they found nothing but women's apparel to reward a search there. In the warehouse, however, they found a pile of fustian corresponding with the description given by the owner and by Mr. Latham ; and Mrs. Snow was at once apprehended as a receiver of stolen goods. Before the boroughreeve she prevaricated, and made a very unsatisfactory statement how she became possessed of the fustians ; but, notwithstanding all other ugly circumstances, being a person of means> 6he was admitted to bail ; her friend, Mr. Gradon,"], [259, "AFTER ALL ! 251 hanging back, however, until he saw more clearly which way the wind blew. In another week she was brought up for trial at the New Bailey, pale and trembling. Another person, who had missed drysaltery goods, claimed a quantity of fustic and copperas found in her warehouse, but loose dry-goods, bearing no mark, could not be sworn to, and the claim was disallowed. Piece-goods, how ever, could be identified, as those had been in Cardwell and Heywood's cellar, by the tab ends bearing the manufacturer's mark. Mrs. Snow was visibly agitated as she heard this : she was not certain whether the tabs had been torn off or not ! On that uncertainty hung transportation or acquittal. The silent witnesses were examined one by one, the pieces were turned over, the prisoner leaning forward breathless and anxious, \u2014 the tabs had been torn from the first lot, and the owner could not be allowed to swear to the goods. She breathed more freely, began to think of an action for false imprison ment or defamation of character, when lo ! the second lot was lifted up, and there the tabs, perfect and undisturbed, told their own tale of ownership and robbery and complicity. It was vain for the prisoner to plead her ignorance \u2014 to say she saw no tabs, or that she bought the goods in the fair way of trade \u2014 and appealed to Mr. Gradon to speak to her character"], [260, "252 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. for integrity. The jury thought differently, and when George Latham and Michael left the court at the New Bailey with Mr. Newton, she had been removed (shrieking and wringing her hands) under sentence of transportation to Botany Bay for fourteen years \u2014 a sentence hailed with glee by many who had long known and suspected her without daring to come forward with an accusation in the face of her \" friend at court.\" After a day spent with Mr. Newton and his agree able family, Mr. Latham and Mr. Ford prepared to return home, since it was evident Jeffery Latham was keeping out of the way. The boroughreeve and constables were, however, furnished with a clear de scription of his person and habits, and a watch was set in the neighbourhood of Meal Street. Early as it was in the year, there had been a heavy fall of snow during the week, followed by high winds, and many of the northern roads were impassable to heavy-stage coaches and waggons. Horsemen, how ever, managed better, and as far as Sandiway our travellers contrived to get, though it was tedious work for the poor beasts. Farther than the Blue Cap it was not judged safe to travel, as was thought by three or four pedestrians who had been there weather bound as many days. George would have ventured forward, in his anxiety to get back to Alice ; but"], [261, "AFTER ALL! 253 Michael, more prudent, thought delay preferable to a snowdrift, and not caring for the accommodation of the Blue Cap, rode back to Northwich. Aster a day or two spent at the Crown, and amongst his old neighbours, the snow began to disappear be fore a rapid thaw. As soon as it was judged expe dient, the two resumed their journey. At the Blue Cap they were warned that the forest was unsafe, the snow lyings so thickly in the hollows as to render the path uncertain, and deep drifts sure. Mounted men, however, had a better chance than wayfarers on foot, so Michael, willing to humour his eager companion, determined to proceed. First, however, he asked the landlord for some of his famous Hollands ; and the man, after a searching scrutiny, produced the liquor, with the remark that he remem bered the gentleman \u2014 and did the gentleman know what had become of his friend Mr. Yawood ; it was long past his time to call. \" By this time he is hanged,\" replied Mr. Ford, gravely ; \" and if I mistake not, you are liable to pains and penalties as his customer. Nay,\" continued he, as the man shrank in dismay, \"I am no informer; I only give you a hint in future to deal only with licensed traders.\" Aghast, the man looked after them as they rode away, their dark figures showing clearly against the whitened ground."], [262, "254 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. As they rode along slowly, the horses' hoofs sink ing in the snow with every step, they conversed about the man they had just left, Ned Bostock, his fate, his accomplices, the sudden judgment which had over whelmed them as it were all at once, the singularity that Jeffery Latham had yet eluded discovery, and the inscrutable mystery attending the dispensation of Providence which punished minor ruffians, while the arch -instigator, old in villany and crime, should be suffered to escape. Whilst talking thus, George interrupted his elder friend, to call his attention to a dark object on the snow, a little on one side of the path. Michael turned Tony's head that way, and, bending down, with his riding-whip pushed at the object; it yielded, and the snow in which it was partially embedded giving way, a man's hat with a broad brim was dis closed. Both men looked at each other with blank faces ; then George, dismounting, ascertained that there was a human head beneath the hat. At once the two rode back to Sandiway, induced the landlord and weather-bound guests to follow with spades and shovels, and an unhinged door, to where the unfortunate traveller lay buried in the drift. Their horses' hoof-tracks marked the road, and the spot, as there they terminated. The sight of a grizzled crop of hair stimulated humanity not less"], [263, "AFTER ALL! 255 than curiosity, and to work the men went with a will. Shovelful after shovelful of the light snow was cast aside, and gradually the head, shoulders, and rigid body of Jeffery Latham were revealed to the asto nished and awed gaze of his nephew and the strange crowd. Whispering to Michael the name of the stiffened corse before him, he at once took the superintendence of the workers ; offered payment, and that stimulated exertion ; the body was freed from the snow and from the dead horse beneath it, and placed on the door for conveyance to the inn. More than one rough tongue reminded the tra vellers that they needed to thank God for their preservation ; that if the hat had been covered with an inch or two more snow, they themselves might have floundered into the drift and been lost. They had strayed from the path which there itself sank in a hollow, and a few steps further would have sufficed to bury them also in its quiet and treacherous bosom. Little did George know, as he rode back again, slowly and silently, behind the dead body of the evil uncle, feared so long\u2014 little did he guess, as he pondered on the sudden doom of the wicked, how exultingly his uncle had entered the forest, regardless of the thick snow which fell in fleecy flakes around"], [264, "256 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. him, obscuring both landscape and path. He had waited in his boat, on the Dee, until he saw the last convulsion of John Tonks; and then, leaving his companion broad-brim to remove their unsold goods, took horse, and rode away, convinced that all who knew his more dangerous secrets were for ever silent, and that he was safe, perfectly safe. He purposed collecting, not only the ill-gotten property, possessed by himself, but also whatever he could lay hands on belonging to the comrades so suddenly dispossessed by the strong hand of the law : and aster selling the stock remaining in Meal Street to his accommodating friend, Mrs. Snow, would retire to France, where he could spend the remainder of his days in ease and pleasure. Immersed in his selfish and wicked projects, with out a regret for the many lives sacrificed on the altar he had set up, or for the chief partner in his bad business, whom he had so unscrupulously immolated in his cell, he rode on through the snow, felicitating himself on his own lucky escape from the \" unfortu nate accidents\" which had cut short the career of his young pupils. Not one of them but was twenty years younger than himself; and here he was, with twenty more years before him, and a fortune ready for the picking up. He would amuse himself with Faro and E. 0., and make himself a man of mark and"], [265, "AFTER ALL ! 257 money before he had done, and live merrily to the last. As for that nephew of his, why \u2014 A sudden plunge and flounder in a deep drift, where the road turned, at an abrupt angle, near Ridley Pool, checked his soliloquy. He tightened the reins, in the attempt to draw his horse to the path, but it only sank deeper with every step, and in less than three minutes be was a buried man ! \u2014 exultant schemes and flattering prospects, all buried with him in a grave cold, pitiless, and treacherous, as he him- self had been through life ! \u2014 the very disguise worn to cover his latest hypocrisy alone exposed, and serving as a beacon to preserve from a like fate the two men he had systematically injured through long years \u2014 saved in fact by his death ! Removed to Sandiway to await an inquest, the landlord recognised the dead man as Mr. Cardwell ; but when George, as his nephew, took possession of the deceased's purse, pocket-book, and so on, he held his peace, wisely thinking the less he said of his connection with Messrs. Cardwell and Heywood, spirit dealers, &c, &c, the better for himself. In one of his fobs was found a watch, the very one stolen from Michael in the forest twelve months before ; but wherefore he had kept that which at any time might have led to detection, could only be VOL. III. s"], [266, "258 god's FEOVIDENCE house. ascribed to the daring consequent on a long career of successful crime. In a few days the inquest was over ; the coroner, privately informed of the relationship between the dead and living Latham, the character of the former, and the errand of the latter to Manchester, as a suf ficient reason for impounding the papers and property of the deceased man. He was buried quietly after the inquest in a corner of Witton churchyard ; leaving none to mourn him \u2014 being a man stained with many and foul crimes, who was not known to possess a tender or kindly feeling. By that time the snow was gone, or almost ; a few fleecy patches in sheltered nooks or holes remained of the white shroud which had covered the dead her bage and the dead man ; and Mr. Ford and George Latham galloped homewards, through Delamere Forest, relieved by the knowledge that their great enemy could trouble them no more. Glad faces, bright smiles, and sweet kisses welcomed the travellers home, their long delayed return having suggested apprehensions of their safety, more particularly when day followed day and (owing to the state of the roads) no letter arrived to give a reason. There was much to hear and to relate. Itinerant newsmongers had cried their catchpenny versions of the \"last dying speech and confession of"], [267, "AFTER ALL! 259 the notorious robbers hanged on Gallows Hill,\" with the attendant \" affecting copy of verses ;\" and also of \" The tragical end of the notorious highwayman, burglar, and smuggler, with a full aud particular account, how he had played the ghost in a great mansion for many years, and all for the low charge of one penny.\" They had cried their news round Shotwick, and at the doors of the Lodge and Grange, to the annoyance of the inmates, until threats of pump and horse-pond drove the ragamuffins away ; but no authentic news reached either house until the Rev. Mr. Gresham and Mr. Peover, the following day, brought correct intelligence, as obtained from the sheriffs. The detail of the exciting and revolting scene at the gallows, shocked both Michael and George, as it must have shocked any one possessed of an atom of humanity ; but it may be owned both Mr. Ford and Mr. Peover rejoiced that \" apoplexy,\" perhaps caused by repentance and remorse, had stepped in to prevent Ned Bostock .being paraded through the streets amidst a hooting crowd, to as certain and more disgraceful a death. Mr. Ford could not forget, how he had pressed his reluctant child to many that man, and that only providential interposition had preserved her from becoming the wife of a felon ; and Mr. Peover was better pleased that his sister's s 2"], [268, "260 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. son should pass away in the solitude of his cell, than as a spectacle for the city's offscourings on Gallows Hill. The officers of the crown lost no time in clearing the cavern of all they could lay hands on, standing by to witness the removal. In the inner chamber was found a small bladder with a pipe in serted in the neck ; this was partially filled with a red fluid resembling blood, and the finder laughingly expressed his \" wonder what the fellows used that stuff for?\" Michael did not wonder; he thought of the stains on the cheese-room floor ; and when the cavern was cleared, and himself seated comfortably by the par lour fire, smoking his long pipe, with his one arm thrown over the back of his wife's easy-chair, he introduced the subject. Alice and George Latham, in very close proximity, were discussing some very interesting matters in the recess of the bay-window at the time, and hearing him name the stained floor above their heads, and the means by which it \"was presumed the stains had been renewed, to his great annoyance and disquiet, they came forward together. Mr. Ford had never named this part of the plot against his peace, though it had troubled him much, and being a new feature in the career of the miscreant who had personated the Grey Lady so long to the"], [269, "AFTER ALL! 261 terror of a whole neighbourhood, and his capture having been so recent, the theme had sufficient in terest even for the absorbed lovers. \" Mr. Ford,\" said George, after listening to the story of the fresh stains, the disturbed cheeses, and Mr. Heywood's insinuations that he was either in league with the assumed spectre, or the actual offender himself, \" the artifice remains a mystery still \u2014 at least to me. Have you any suspicion how the rascal en tered the house from all sides while the outer doors were locked and bolted ? I confess the secret defies my sagacity.\" \" Um \u2014 um,\" murmured Michael. \" Well, no ; but that is a question of moment, for if one rogue could get in, another of the gang may. It must be looked to at once,\" and he stretched his arm in front of his wife, and pulled the embroidered bell-rope to summon Dick. Close questioning elicited from Dick that the kitchen-door had opened to admit the pretended ghost without unlocking, as if the lock itself had drawn back from the staple. This overturned a theory advanced by Alice, that John Tonks had made duplicate keys ; so George Latham suggested an ex amination of the locks themselves. That on the kitchen-door was pressed, and pulled, and pushed ineffectually. Michael removed the screws to take"], [270, "262 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. the lock off; but the screws had been placed there for show, not use, the lock remaining firmly fixed to the door when they were withdrawn. This perplexed him more than ever ; but George, who was not wanting in shrewdness, stepped into the yard, closed the door, tried the large square-headed nail imme diately over the lock. It yielded \u2014 pushed to the right, and the door flew open. The mechanism was very simple. The prominent nail-head was a stud in a socket which drew back a movable portion of the door to which the lock was secured by clips of its own. The wood-work moved in grooves, yet so little appearance of any machinery was visible, even when the lock was off, that an un suspecting locksmith would have screwed an ordinary lock on the door, ignorant of the slight alteration needed to render his lock a nullity. A few longer screws were procured, and each lock was fastened down to the door itself, which made the sliding frame of no avail. , Michael laughed to think how soon the doors were secured without even a change of locks. George found that the bolts acted on a similar principle, and that was remedied by moving them below or above the sliding stud. Alice had stood by, watching these discoveries and alterations, and did not fail to express her regret that"], [271, "AFTER ALL! 263 so much ingenuity and mechanical skill should have been so misapplied and perverted. Immediately after his return from Manchester, the trials and executions being over, Michael had the entrance to the caverns effectually blocked up to pre vent any remnant of the band returning when the affair was supposed to be forgotten ; and he nailed a stout plank over the trap in the cheese-room (which closed with a sound like a heavy fall), to keep mischief lovers from playing ghost-pranks in the future. Mally, whom Mr. Peover had taken into his house to assist her mother (sending her boy to a distant boarding-school), acquainted Mr. Ford that there was another entrance to the cavern, but she had no know ledge of its whereabouts. Months after, when Mr. Peover's men were employed to clear the stones and rubbish from what appeared an old well, in hope to invite the water back, the labourer stoopingly descend ing the steps under the hood of the well, stumbled forward against the upright stone back ; it gave wav> and but that he clutched the edges of the hood in falling, the probability is the man would have lost his life. A steep, dark flight of stone steps were exposed ; this led to passages communicating with a small rock chamber not before seen. Here, in an iron chest broken open with difficulty, were found secreted valu ables the general band knew nothing of. Antique"], [272, "\u2666 264 god's providence house. plate bearing the Grenville crest, jewels which pro bably had been stolen or won from noble owners in other lands, papers detailing the plan of the Heywood conspiracy, the form of oath taken on joining the league, and an old parchment dating back to the reign of the first Charles, on which was traced a plan of the Grange and the secret passages beneath it, constructed, as the writer said, in troublous times for shelter, security, or flight, though a prayer to avert the necessity was appended. That described minutely the stone doors connecting the different rock-chambers, and four outlets, to the river, the grounds, the road, and the house. Michael had the chest removed, the entrance built up, and the choking rubbish cleared from the well-mouth. Gradually \u2014 not all at once \u2014 the gloom which had hung over the Grange disappeared, the servants re sumed their vacated sleeping-rooms, and instead of quitting when their several terms expired, sought per mission to remain. Michael's moodiness and irrita bility wore away ; he extended his improvements, and ceased to think of resigning so promising an estate. Nor had they any lack of visitors. George Latham of course spent as much of his time under Mr. Ford's roof as he reasonably could, one pretext or another bringing him every day \u2014 and he was not ushered into that gentleman's private room for dismissal when"], [273, "AFTER ALL! 265 he came, but walked to the home-parlour as one of the family. Then Madam Latham came to visit the invalid with little niceties made by her housekeeper, and Mr. Prestbury brought his wife and eldest girl to see her; Mrs. Peover and Mr. Peover (when rheumatism permitted) drove over at times, and so did Mr. and Mrs. Dutton so long as she was able to bear the jolting. Then tedious Dr. Wimslow came occasionally to see his patient, and remained to dine, drink wine, listen to Alice's harpsichord, and try George Latham's patience. Mrs. Wright also, now there was no spectre to fear, became a frequent visitant, bringing a book or work, and reading or chatting to her old school-friend very cosily. The once desolate mansion had indeed become what Michael had prophecied \u2014 the abode of a happy and united family. But symptoms of other unions and changes became apparent. People, learned in such matters, prognos ticated a wedding at the Grange before Christmas, arguing from the frequent attendance of young Mrs. Wood both at Lodge and Grange, the many errands Peggy was apparently sent to the tasty mantua maker, and the assiduity with which the latter plied scissors and needle in her new home, that she was occupied with preparations for the great event at both houses."], [274, "266 god's providence house. As is often the case, conjecture was only partially correct. There was a wedding, and Ph\u0153be Wood (now steadied down into a loving and domestic little wife) was making the wedding garments, but though ample, they were neither fine nor extravagant, only such as befitted a sober and respectable country woman. Peggy's errands were her own. Dick never aban doned an idea once adopted, so as soon as the hubbub created by the revolution at the Grange was over, he spoke to his master, asked his consent, said he and Peggy had courted for \" ever so long,\" and sought for permission to occupy the newly-built cottage. Michael's reply was a cordial one : he felt himself indebted to his faithful servant for the bravery which had averted ruin from his family ; and the cottage which he had originally built (prospectively) for the accommodation of Dick and Peggy, he gave to Dick and his immediate descendants, with a plot of land, at a peppercorn rent ; at the same time installing him as farm-bailiff, and Peggy as general super intendent of the home farm ; promoting Sally to Peggy's vacant place. The increasing work in dairy and poultry-yard, joined to Mrs. Ford's lameness, rendered this a wise arrangement ; for Peggy was not only trustworthy but efficient, and having been in-"], [275, "AFTER ALL !' 267 structed by her mistress from girlhood, a better substitute could not have been. A cow and a pig, sent by Michael, found their way to the cottage ; and George Latham, equally grateful, furnished the in terior solidly and well ; and while Madam Latham supplied all needful household linen, Mrs. Ford stocked a large oak-coffer with dresses and other gar ments sufficient for half a lifetime. This accounted for Ph\u0153be Wood's active fingers, journeys to and fro, and Peggy's errands to \" be tried on.\" The gossips were not the only persons disappointed that no one was married but Peggy and Dick. George Latham felt as if his term of probation had been quite long enough ; but Mr. Ford, terribly afraid of making a second mistake, insisted on further delay, which Madam Latham seconded on the score of decorum ; and the ardent lover waited until the following spring with a very ill grace, spending the intervening months in decorating and ornamenting his family mansion for the reception of his bride, whenever Mr. Ford would consent to their marriage. When the snowdrops were gone, and the crocuses lingered ; when violets and primroses peeped from be neath their verdant coverts, and the tree-buds broke out into little green fans, the Rev. Mr. Gresham, in Shotwick church, pronounced the nuptial benediction over George and Alice Latham."], [276, "268 god's providence house. Asthma, choler, and a \" capital cook,\" had carried off the puffy old parson during the severe winter, so George had inducted his friend into the living, to the general satisfaction of his flock, and theirs was the first marriage he solemnized aster his elevation ; a change which would enable him to marry a young girl who had waited ten years for the curate, whose poverty forbade matrimony. There was of course a general holiday in the village, a wedding-breakfast at the Grange, and a wedding-dinner at the Lodge; on the lawn below the terraces long tables were spread, and abundantly covered with a feast for the servants and tenants of both houses. Barrels of ale were broached, fiddlers provided ; and if the rejoicing on the lawn was not as complete as the rejoicing in the mansion, it cer tainly was more noisy and uproarious. Madam Latham, for that occasion, discarded her black velvet train for a rich violet-velvet robe ; Sirs. Ford (now able to walk about with the aid of a crutched stick) was dressed in a flowered brocade, so stiff the hoop beneath might well have been dispensed with ; and even grave Mrs. Peover, to honour the day, set her dark garb aside, for a costly, yet quiet, suit of slate-grey satin. Mrs. Wright was there, gorgeous and grand. Mrs. Dutton, frail and delicate, with a tiny baby in a perfect bower of lace, a robe two yards"], [277, "after all! 269 long, and more caps than would be admitted into a baby's wardrobe at this day ; and Mr. Dutton atten tive to the wife, and proud of the wonderful baby. Mr. Newton had come from Manchester, with Mrs. Newton on a pillion behind him, to share the festi vities and make the acquaintance of the bride, with whom he vowed he fell over head and ears in love on the spot. Mr. Brad well had brought his daughter over from Northwich to be bridesmaid, and Mr. Gresham's patient and faithful betrothed was there, hopeful and happy, herself a bride elect. The two men of medicine contrasted with each other of course. Miss Prestbury, by her father's side, bantered Dr. Wimslow on his bachelorhood, and sportively declined his long-drawn offer of heart and hand, as being much too old for him. There were stately friends of the Latham's, homely friends of the Ford's ; but there was no friend so delighted as old Mr. Peover. A select party from the village had assembled to dine in the housekeeper's room, and there Ph\u0153be shone in rival glory with Peggy. But Mr. Peover had no rival \u2014 he shone everywhere, jerking from group to group, from room to room, now on the lawn with the rustics, anon with Mrs. Emery's guests, back again into the drawing-room, with a restlessness expressive of his intense satisfaction."], [278, "270 god's providence house. It had its origin strangely. Madam Latham, when her new daughter cast aside the lilac scarf-cloak she had worn in church, and her light open robe of spotted India muslin, floating like gossamer over a lilac satin under-gown, her chestnut hair drawn from her forehead, and hanging in massive curls behind, met Alice at her chamber door, and clasped round her white throat a valuable necklace of emeralds and pearls, in quaint antique setting. She accompanied her gift with the remark, that it was a family relic, highly valued, as the only family jewel which had not been lost when Chester was besieged by Crom well ; moreover, she smilingly added \u2014 \" The ancients ascribed wondrous protective virtues to the emerald, and if we may adopt old-world beliefs, my wedding present is an omen of all the good fortune I wish, and would bespeak for my dear son's dear wife.\" Alice thanked Madam Latham with inherent affection, grace, and dignity, and together they rejoined the guests. Presently a servant intimated that Mr. Peover desired to speak with Mrs. George Latham, in the breakfast-room. Blushing, as the new name fell on her unaccustomed ear, she hastened to the old gentle man, whom she found in a sort of brown study, gazing at a small case on the table. As Alice opened the door he looked up ; the"], [279, "after all ! 271 emerald circlet on her neck rivetted his gaze. For some moments he was speechless, then \u2014 \" Where did you get that? Where did you get that?\" burst from his trembling lips, as he pointed to the ornament. \" It is a wedding-gist from Madam Latham. But why do you ask ? and what has caused your agita tion ?\" asked Alice, greatly amazed. \" My dear young lady, I too brought you a wedding present. Look at it, look at it ; and do not marvel at my surprise \u2014 my surprise !\" A pair of bracelets lay in the open case; emeralds and pearls set to correspond with the necklace so exactly, that no doubt could exist but that they had originally formed one set. She looked to Mr. Peover in astonishment for an explanation, which he seemed unable to supply. \" Go and bring your husband hither. Do not send, do not send, go \u2014 go !\" said he hastily. Wonderingly, Alice sought her bridegroom, and returned with him. \" George, where did your mother get that neck lace \u2014 that necklace ?\" said Mr. Peover, extending his hand towards it as he spoke. \" I'm sure, I cannot tell ; I have never seen it be fore. My mother has worn no jewellery since my last brother's death. Alice tells me it is a gift to her;"], [280, "272 god's providence house. and I am certain it could not be better placed ;\" and the proud husband lightly listed the circlet from the fair neck on which it reposed, to examine it more closely, his touch calling the warm blood to her very forehead. \" I must see Madam Latham \u2014 I must see Madam Latham ! Go for her, George \u2014 go for her !\" en treated the old man, becoming very excited ; \" and bring Mr. Ford with you \u2014 bring Mr Ford,\" he called aster George from the door. They came \u2014 were shown the corresponding jewels, to their equal astonishment. Madam Latham gave the history of the necklace, as far as she knew it ; and Mr. Peover, in a perfect tremor, told over again, that \u25a0which Michael knew, and George's father had known years before, of the treasure he had found. Those bracelets were amongst the jewels ; he had retained them, at first for their beauty and singularity, after wards as a present for his godson's wife, whenever he married, and had brought them for the purpose. He could not give them now ; they were not his to give, as he had found the owner. He had long felt con vinced the chest had been hastily buried by some royalist, who had either perished, or forgotten in the confusion the spot where it had been secreted. And now he had found the real owners, his mind was relieved of a heavy load. It would be a pleasure to"], [281, "273 AFTER ALL refund to his dear boy, and hand over the remainder of the unsold jewels. \" Do not say one word about refunding, Mr. Peover ; I do not need the money. Clasp the brace lets on my dear wife's arm, and she will thank you for them. They are as much your gift as though a Latham never saw them. They were lost to me and mine ; you have fortunately recovered, preserved, and restored them. And as such trinkets are not much in Mrs. Peover 's way, you can make Alice a present of the remainder ; she can wear them well. Now, not another word ; let us go back to our friends. Come, my darling !\" So saying, George took the hand of his bride and led her away, the recovered bracelets sparkling on her round white arms, to the envy, or admiration, of many beholders. While Mr. Peover remained a little time to talk the matter over with Michael and Madam Latham, wonderfully elated with the unexpected dis covery, and more than ever convinced he had reason to assume to himself the motto on his house \u2014 \" God's Providence is mine inheritance.\" the end. vol. in."], [282, "LONDON : PKCTTT^ DT WE7XMM CtfVTFS AND SO&S, STAMPCT.D STRF.FT, AND CHARING CROSS."], [283, ""], [284, ""], [285, ""], [286, ""]]
