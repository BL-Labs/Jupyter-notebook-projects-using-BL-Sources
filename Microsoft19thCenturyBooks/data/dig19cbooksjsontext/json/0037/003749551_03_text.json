At last he has run so hard his worldly race, that he is out of breath. He pauses, and the first heat is over. He comes home to the village, and finds, to his surprise, that a factory and a poor rate have sprung up in his absence.

Per haps it is that the scene around us is lec turing us on the litter\u00e6 humaniores of na ture \u2014 is speaking in that language we so little like to hear, and is full of hints and whispered revelations of that arch event of life\u2014 the end of it. There are a thousand little, silent, elo quent, indications lying strewed in our path, which are, as it were, the grey hairs of the year. A sluggish mist is stealing up the valley and wreathing itself among the waning trees. There is a shrewdness in the evening air, a dullness which retards the blood, and which speaks the very language of decay. Quicken thy steps, oh ! wayfarer, \" The day is far spent. The night is at hand."], [17, "VALETTA. 9 Behold, the hour cometh when no man can work.\" Thus whisper to us the long evening shadows as they creep over the meadows \u2014 no longer the strong and clearly defined shadows thrown by the lusty sum mer's sun. They are faint, wavering, un certain, and mingling with the general dimness around them. They are like the purposes of our own life's autumn. They are like ourselves \u2014 shadows of a shade. As we pass the old ivy-grown church of Norley, with its clock chronicling the evening hour of rest, and those silent, ever eloquent graves, the moralities of the scene are getting too strong for us. W e shake our heads, sigh, and as usual, when hard pressed, change the subject. Those who dwelt among the tombs were mad and possessed of devils. We are sane and possessed of nothing more formidable than our own pounds, shillings, and pence. What have we to do among the tombs \u2014 are we not immortal . B 5"], [18, "10 VALETTA.

We ring \u2014 listen to the peal as it sounds loudly through the old house \u2014 and while Mr. Jacob is brushing his hair, and putting on his coat, to prepare himself for the unwon ted duty of answering us, we gaze at the sad old yew tree, and the grass plot, and the cocks and hens\u2014 Everything is exactly the same as the year before, except the cocks and hens, which, thanks to the women of the house, have got themselves into wonderfully good case.

Time does not always give us a worse opinion of ourselves, especially when it fails to do us the kind ness of giving us an opportunity of com paring our own perfections with those of the rest of the world. Besides the weak ness of the Sultan is the Vizier's strength, and the declension of the old Squire was the strongest tonic to his factotum's self-esteem. He condescends to admit us into the house. Leaving the parlour door on the left, and the hall on the right, we take our course along the passage, and up the narrow stair, with the twisted walnut wood banisters, and presently find ourselves in an upper matted corridor, lighted at the end by a single narrow window. Its sides are of dark wainscot, relieved at intervals by dingy time-stained prints of sea fights, in black wooden frames with narrow gold headings. At the end of this gallery are two doors ;"], [21, "13 VALETTA. one, which is constantly locked, commu nicates with a narrow stair, which leads into the deserted nest of attics, whose un explored labyrinths extend among the roofs and attics of the upper story of the mansion. The other is the entrance to the Squire's room. It is a deep-set door of solid oak. It opens softly under our hand. We enter, and find ourselves in a large chamber, which, at that evening hour, derives but a faint light from a single window. It is not a window at any time calculated to favour the day. It has heavy stone mullions, and small diamond-shape casements, in the upper panes of which still appear the armorial devices of the Hardymans of old. In the recess of this window is a small cushioned seat, from which may be caught a view of a road leading to the offices of the house and farm. The Squire has trimmed his trees so as"], [22, "14 VALETTA. to open this point of view. It affords but a glimpse, it is true, but it is the key of the position. It is the path along which those notoriously migratory articles, milk and eggs, and beer, and broken meat must pass, before they can make their way out of the Squire's premises into the village ; and when the old gentleman is sufficiently well to rise from his bed, here he will sit by the hour with his late brother's, the admiral's, black leather, ship's telescope fixed on this spot, doing his best to keep himself from being eaten out of house and home. At the moment when we enter, this look out spot is unoccupied, but Peggy Franko is seated on the ground beside it. She is still the same. There she is in the most uncomfortable racking position, her red face stamped with an uneasy look, her red hands playing vacantly with the leaves of her spelling-book, and her re bellious red hair parted on one side, as"], [23, "15 VALtTTA. stubbornly as ever, and rising up, and en deavouring to force her neat mob cap off her head, as vigorously as if each separate hair were a distinct political rouge deter mined to be at the top of affairs, and to have nothing higher than itself. If the hypercritical had been determined to find a change in Peggy\u2014 though none should be hypercritical where a lady is in the case \u2014 they might possibly have discovered that the margins of her quiet grey eyes had caught more of the general red hue of her face \u2014 that grey was beginning to mingle itself with her hair, and that there was a something sad and subdued about her general bearing. Beyond this, however, there was no change. There was the old cap, the, old brown holland apron with the bib and sleeve straps, the old pebble brooch, the long cherished first present from the absent one, formerly hoarded away, and produced only on rare and solemn occasions, now"], [24, "16 VALETTA. constantly worn even in the most desperate scouring campaigns. And there was the very old spelling-book open \u2014 alas, oh! Minerva ! that it should be recorded \u2014 open at exactly the old column. The fact is, Peggy seemed to have come to that culminating point which they would have us believe, sooner or later, all things and people arrive at, and was now rapidly lapsing back again into the dark ages.

For the Squire was sick, although the doctor had carefully avoided disclosing this to the little lady in Belgium, and had on the contrary roundly declared that the old gentleman was most hearty. The real fact, however, was, that soon \u2014 very soon \u2014 after that sad event of the year before, the old gentleman had taken to his bed, from which he had never since thoroughly emancipated himself. The room was so silent, however, that one might have fancied that the woman who sat there self-absorbed, was its only occupant . It was one of those rooms to which silence seems the most natural and becom- ing ornament. There was little there which spoke of its occupant. The Squire was one of those"], [26, "18 VALETTA. who are always afraid to use what is their own, and who pass through life with few indulged tastes, and few purely personal belongings. Along the sides of the dark wainscot there reared themselves huge antique cabi nets, some in richly carved oak, with over hanging tops resting on twisted pillars. In a corner, there was a vast ebony coffer, worked in marquetrie of rare foreign woods, and with a silver scroll on its lock. In the centre of the room there was a table, with sturdy, stunted legs. The chairs were fantastically wrought in oak. There was a circular mirror, with its silver frosted Venus, of Venetian art ; and a dozen other objects, which might have served as a handsome marriage portion for some fair Jessica of Wardour Street, but which were here unmarked and unprized.

The fact is, he did not see them.

By the side of the old man's bed, sat a fair young child of fifteen \u2014 the little Rhoda, with watchful ears, and meekly crossed hands, and gentle, patient, loving, and sorrowing thoughts dwelling in her mind, and tinging her downcast face with their radiance.

For the men of Thermopyl\u00e6 they can show the women of Saguntum ; for the hand which Sc\u00e6vola thrust into the fire because it had failed to assassinate the in vading monarch of his country \u2014 they can bring the arm which Marguerite Douglas thrust through the staple of the door at Scone Abbey to keep out the assassins of her king. For every act of this sort, which we can adduce, they can cap us with a parallel \u2014 with a more than parallel, for the motive of the deed is with them more noble, and will always turn the scale in their favour. Even of those virago heroines, Joan's heart was nerved by religion, and the arm of that fair \" slasher,\" Mary Amree, braced by the minor religion of the sex \u2014 love. But besides these they have another heroism which is all their own \u2014 a heroism which is born of love and reared in trial"], [35, "27 VALETTA. which lives and loves and hopes on, when the pleasures of life are at an end \u2014 when there is nothing which can claim love as its worthy due, and when hope itself should reasonably expire \u2014 a heroism which seeks not the brilliant sacrifice of a moment's enthusiasm but finds its sphere of exertion in the enduring trials of that unaspiring martyrdom of daily and hourly life \u2014 with none to applaud \u2014 none even to witness \u2014 without expectation of release, and without even hope of appreciation or acknowledg ment. This is a woman's heroism. Presently the stillness of the room was broken by the sharp, abrupt voice of the old Squire. \" Rhoda, gal, I want to speak with you.\" Anything in the nature of a confidential communication from this unconfiding and uncommunicative old gentleman was suffi cient at once to excite the greatest atten tion. C 2"], [36, "28 VALETTA. Peggy opened her eyes to the widest, as she sat in the distant part of the room by the window. \" Rhoda, gal,\" said the Squire, \" I want to speak with you.\" \" Yes ! dear grandpapa,\" said she, re turning at once from that particular chateau in the neighbourhood of a certain foreign town to which her imagination had been on a visit. \" Come round a'toth'er side, gal, and draw the curtain.\" The girl, who had been sitting on the dark side of the bed, moved round with a skilful step, and silently drew back the heavy folds of the rich, old faded brocade. There was the Squire sitting in an almost upright position, propped by pillows. He still wore the old buff waistcoat, with the old stains and spots, and the old flannel jacket, from one of whose pockets peeped out the buck-horn handle of the old knife. For the white neck -cloth, which was his"], [37, "29 VALETTA. usual wear, he had substituted a yellow bandana pocket-handkerchief with a small white spot. \" People don't expect so much of one when one's ill,\" he observed, with reference to this change, \"and it saves a precious site o' money in washing.\" The face of the old man, though sharpened about the lines on the cheek, was otherwise unaltered. It was as clean, as keen, as closely shaven, as expressive of dogged energy as in the days when he per sonally inspected six teams and a hen-roost before breakfast, or rose at five to disin herit his daughter, and indorse a memo randum of the act and deed. For several minutes the old gentleman took no notice of Rhoda, who stood waiting to receive his commands. At length, with an effort, he unmuzzled his heavy jaws, and said, abruptly, \" How's the wind ?\" \" South by south east, dear grand papa.\""], [38, "30 VALETTA Every one in the house could speak to a hair's breadth on this point. \" Werry good,\" said the old man, muz zling up his jaws, and again relapsing into himself. The girl stood waiting with her hands folded, occupying herself by planning in her mind a different angle for one of the invalid's pillows. Presently this subject was exhausted ; and as the old gentleman still remained silent, she had to select another topic of thought. \" How beautiful he looks this evening,\" thought Rhoda, by way of changing the subject. At last he spoke again. \" Hum ! sou' by sou' west ; dead agin those as are going across the water.\" The Squire said this in the most in different tone in the world, though he was a man who, by the way, seldom talked at all on a matter on which he was indifferent. Any approach to the continent of Europe seemed so near an approach to the great"], [39, "31 VALETTA. forbidden topic, that Rhoda turned away her head to conceal the blush which the throb of hope sent mantling over her face and neck. She held her breath to hear more. \" But right a-starn of them as are coming across the water,\" added the Squire. This time she stooped over the table, and busied herself among the medicine bottles. \" If, after all, that dear, good grandpapa should say anything about her. Who knows . He was so very good, and kind \u2014 so wise and wonderful. He might even give leave to open one of her letters \u2014 who could tell . \u2014 who could set a limit to his benevolence 1\" so thought the child. \" Don't you go a-spilling that 'ere doctor's stuff.

TJe don't fill his bottles full enough for that. Too wide awake. Ah! a precious thieving lot, them doctors.\" The medicine taken, and its flavour softened to the palate by many bahs and muttered anathemas, the Squire set down the glass. \" I never heer'd of much good as come of taking physic,\" said he. For some minutes he silently pursued the train of thought opened up by this reflection. After a time he dismissed it and, again turning to his grand- daughter, said, \" I suppose it's a matter of some days to Turkey V\" \" Yes, dear grandpapa. Mr. Scam mony said that the railway, as far as \u2014 \" \"Oh! don't go a-talking of railways. Mark my words, gal\u2014 no good will ever come o' that business.\""], [41, "33 VALETTA.

Werry like. People didn't go a pleasuring in my time. It was other guess work in Bouey's days. No good ever comes of pleasuring.\" Here the old man gave a groan, and shut his eyes, and the child divined that his mind had travelled back as far as that unfortunate day of the inspection. The next time he spoke it was with a certain apologetic hesitation of tone. \" I say, gal, 1 don't set much account by foreign places, you know. I\u2014 I suppose this Turkey now is \u2014 \" \" Yes, dear grandpapa.\" \" Is a sort of a \u2014 \" \" Yes, dear grandpapa \u2014 Turkey in c 5"], [42, "34 VALETTA. Europe \u2014 is a very fine and fertile region, anciently very flourishing.\" The Squire rubbed his hands, and bowed his head, as much as to say that a fine and fertile region would be at all times worthy of his attentive consideration. \" The government is despotic under the grand Senior, who is master of the lives and property of his subjects.\" \"Ah! I don't like them despotics. I never did when the Emperor of Rushey was over here after the war.

In the meantime Peggy sat all wonder in her corner. \" Bless that little angel,\" thought she, \" she knows more than the parish clerk.\" Rhoda persisted ; perhaps she had a suspicion that she was, at all events, sure of one attentive listener. \" The metropolis of Turkey is Constan tinople, finely situated in forty-one degrees north latitude, between the sea of Marmora and the Black Sea.

Rhoda was silent, for her breath was gone \u2014 They were getting so very near to Ostende in their conversation. \" Perhaps he'll write to say he's coming.\" \" Very likely, very likely indeed, dear grandpapa.\" The old gentleman turned his face away from the light, and from the eager, earnest eyes of the child, and muttered something about sleeping. \" Rhoda, gal,\" said he presently, in a faint voice, from under the counterpane. \" Yes, dear grandpapa.\" \" If a letter should by any chance come \u2014 \" a pause. \" A letter from foreign parts, I mean\u2014\" another pause. This time longer. \" Why p'rhaps I'd better see it. And I say, gal ; you needn't let that little Jacob know anything about it. You"], [46, "38 VALETTA. know you can just quietly bring it your self; the little chap's got more work on his hands a'ready than he can rightly manage ; you understand.\" There was no answer. If the old gentle man had thought it worth while to ascer tain why there was no answer to this, his high behest, and had drawn aside the curtain, he would have found the child buried in Peggy Franko's arms, while the happy tears coursed down her little cheeks. Perhaps, however, he required no answer or comment, for almost immediately after he either was or feigned to be asleep. There is a hope whose expectation as the moment draws near, rises into a sort of terror which obliges it to desert its watch. Perhaps this is an arrangement of nature to prepare the frame for that shock of dis appointment which it is, alas, so often doomed to meet. The hour for the postman's visit came. Rhoda was in her own room, kneelino- at"], [47, "39 VALETTA. the side of her little bed ; her head buried in the clothes, and her hands placed over her ears. Nevertheless, she heard the horn. There was at any rate a letter i that was something. Presently there was a tap at the door, and that most musical discord of Peggy Franko's voice was heard, proclaiming a letter from foreign parts. \" You must give it him yourself, dear Peggy ; I feel I cannot, indeed, dear Peggy, indeed I cannot. Yes, I will come\u2014 I am coming presently.\" Coming presently ! what a convenient and charmingly ambiguous phrase . The maiden, so anxious and so afraid to face her lover, glances for encouragement at her mirror \u2014 lingers in the vain hope that the tell-tale blushes will subside, and is \" coming presently.\" The mother, who has stolen five minutes from her household cares, and hurried away to take a glance at the pledge of the lost or absent one, and to"], [48, "40 VALETTA breathe a prayer, dries her eyes and is \" coming presently.\" The young gentle man, who yielding to a moment's tempta tion, has eaten the clandestine tartlet, and is busily engaged in washing away the evidence of his guilt, is \" coming pre sently \" \u2014 so is the gentleman who is re quested to \" settle that little account \" \u2014 so is the long expected good time, and Christ mas and the millenium, and much that we know of, and still more that we know not of besides \u2014 All is \" coming presently.\" And so little Rhoda went presently; but first, ere she rose from her knees, with her little hands clasped together, and her eyes to Heaven, she murmured forth that uni verse-shaking incantation, the \" little child's petition \u2014 \" the prayer of the hum ble,\" which \" pierceth the clouds.'' When Rhoda returned trembling to the invalid's room the old gentleman was sitting up in bed. Peggy had just brought a candle, which she held for him with one"], [49, "41 VALETTA hand, while with her other she pushed aside the short locks of tawny hair which in the excitement of the moment had at length effected their escape from under her cap. Rhoda got behind her, and, with one hand firmly wound into her skirt, ventured to look forth. The old gentleman turned the letter over and over, and examined the seal. As he did so he gave a half glance at the eager eyes of the women, and a large' lump gradually raised itself in his left cheek, and he passed his hand slowly once or twice across his mouth. Then he set to work to examine the outside of the letter again. \" Humph !\" said he, raising it to his nose. \" Precious highly flavoured smell, anyhow. Pah !\" At length, having again glanced round, and again stroked his mouth, he seemed to think he had dallied with the impatience of"], [50, "42 VALETTA. the women sufficiently, and, having broken the seal, he read aloud as follows : \" ' Dearest Uncle \u2014 [\" Hulloa there, you Peggy Franko !\" cried the Squire, suddenly pausing, \"what the deuce are you after V] Peggy's face was turned away, and the candle drooped and shook in her hand.

Dearest Uncle, \" I shall remain your devoted Niece, \" Laura Elizabeth Stiltmarche.\" \" Humph !\" said the Squire, deliberately folding up the letter and endorsing it with the carpenter's pencil, \u2014 \" The paper is rather high scented, and the last bit of the letter too flowery for my fancy, but the first part is werry right and proper; and you, Peggy Franko there, with your flighty fine lady airs and your sinful wastings, and grumblings at wholesome"], [53, "45 VALETTA. wittles may take a lesson from it \u2014 and you too Rhoda \u2014 come out girl \u2014 where are vou V Poor little Rhoda thus apostrophised emerged from behind the friendly shelter of Peggy's skirt, and presented but a sorry spectacle. Her eyes, though she had dabbled her tiny little hands into them to quench the tears, were still glistening and very red. There was a desperate woe-begone air about her face, very eloquent and very difficult to resist. \" Take away that ere light you, Peggy Franko,\" said the Squire, \" it hurts my eyes, and go and send little Jacob here.\" Peggy put the candle on a distant table, and left the room with so elaborate an attempt at caution that the boards, unable to resist the temptation, cracked and creaked and groaned out of sheer mischief, at every step she took. For a moment there was silence."], [54, "46 VALETTA. \" Come hither child,\" said the old man, '\u2022 where's your hand.\" The little palm was in his horny grip \u2014 Could he let it go \u2014 Could he let anything go on which those metacarpal bones had once closed. \" Down lower,\" said the Squire. He whispered for a single second in her ear, and then pushed away the hand, almost rudely, and as if he were ashamed of the momentary weakness, said abruptly, and in a tone of more than ordinary asperity ; \" There, get to bed lass, get to bed \u2014 and I say-\" \" Yes . dearest Grandpapa,\" \" Don't you go a wasting your time and burning down half a dozen candles. Such a night as this I should even go to bed by the light of the moon, and used to it when I was of your age.\" The child followed the injunctions to the letter. In half an hour she was in"], [55, "47 VALETTA. so deep a slumber that not even the elaborate efforts at silence made by Peggy, who came to see that all was well, were sufficient to disturb her. Peggy set down her light at the door of the nursery and advanced towards the bed, which was by the side of the window. The child was lying with her face turned towards it. Her hands folded together on her breast, and her fair, brown hair wan dering over her face. Peggy looked down upon her, and, at first, thought she was feigning sleep, for the moonlight, which, having risen over an angle of the old church tower and forced its way among the deep foliage of the dark old ilex, shone softly in her face ; and by its light, Peggy could see that a smile was wandering over her lips. \" Poor child,\" thought she, when she found out her mistake ; \" well, it's a won der \u2014 They soon forget, these young folks !\" A still greater wonder would she have"], [56, "48 VALETTA. thought it had she known the history of that smile ; and that the Squire had whis pered in the child's ear, \" Cheer up, lass ; cheer up, we'll see yet, what can be done about it all.\" But a little wonder was enough to last Peggy a long time, so she returned to her master's room, seated herself on the floor again, and enforced her unwilling eyes to the attack of an advancing column of many syllables."], [57, "49 VALETTA CHAPTER III No man can be quite a fool who succeeds in persuading those around him of his wisdom The Squire had so completely impressed his humble retainers with this faith, that they regarded him as a species of dalai- Llama \u2014 or at least, as the most wonderful of men.

D"], [58, "50 VALETTA. able ; still, in his own secret heart, subscribed implicitly to the faith which Peggy and Rhoda openly professed. The result of all this was, that the Squire had established an autocracy, in which, not only were the laws he chose to impose implicitly obeyed, but even tti<= motives in which they originated were un questioned and their consequences uncan vassed. Thus, when by the old gentleman's high behest, Valetta was cut off from all com munication with the family and her name was forbidden to be mentioned \u2014 no one ques tioned the justice or wisdom of this sentence. All regarded it as the natural consequence of her offence ; and though each silently and deeply deplored it, and grieved for the lost one, and prayed and watched for the moment when the tides of wrath would go down, and her name might once more be mentioned among them, no repining word was ever spoken out upon the subject. On that same evening, when the Squire"], [59, "51 VALETTA. had conned over his niece's letter, and de cided upon the course of action which it became him to adopt, he sent to summon Jacob to make known to him his determi nation on the matter. Some delay was occasioned by the re peated declarations of the serving man, that it was impossible for him to find time to go to his master. This was his usual course of policy, whenever he found that he was really likely to be seriously wanted. He considered that it had the effect of enhancing his services and of making people appreciate his value. At length, sufficient time having elapsed to satisfy this notion of his, Peggy suc ceeded in bringing him to his master ; and having performed this arduous task to her own complete satisfaction, she placed her candle on the floor and seated herself be side it, at her usual post by the window. \" Jacob,\" said the Squire. \" Yes, your honour.\" \" How do things go on V d 2"], [60, "52 VALETTA. \" Why, your honour,\" said the man. \" I am worked ready to drop \u2014 slaving \u2014 \" \" Wery good, Jacob, that'll do,\" said the old gentleman, hastening to nip in the bud a declaration of grievances which might end in some serious demand. \" We all must work hard now-a-days, my little fellow. Bad times, uncommon bad. Many folks are lowering their wages right and left.\" \" As to lowering,\" began Jacob. \" Don't interrupt me, man,\" said the Squire, holding up his hand. \" As to interrupting,\" began Jacob, again, in a dogged tone. \" There, don't go a snapping an old man's head off.\" \" As to--\" \"Wery good. I've a couple of people coming to stay in the house \u2014 a man and his wife \u2014 my nevey and niece.\" \" Can't be \u2014 can't, indeed, your honour \u2014 sorry, but it really can't,\" said Jacob, shaking his head, and folding his arms,"], [61, "VALETTA. 53 prepared to argue this point, at any rate, to the last extremity. \" I tell yer it shall be though,\" roared the old gentleman. \" I tell you it \u2014 \" began Jacob ; but sud denly his voice died away, and he became silent. For so remarkable an occurrence as this, there must naturally be an adequately remarkable cause. It was no other than this. Peggy Franko, on all ordinary occa sions Mr. Jacob's most submissive ser vant, at this great crisis, no sooner ob served the turn things were taking, than she shut her book, and scrambled up from the floor. She then advanced stealthily along the room, so as to escape the Squire's observation, and coming unawares behind Jacob, seized his arm in her stalwart gripe, and whispered in an excited, threatening tone. \" Don't you go aggravating him \u2014 now \u2014 you. He's nigh upon coming round about"], [62, "54 VALETTA. my poor child. If you do, I'll wring your little head off \u2014 mind \u2014 you \u2014 '' Jacob squinted round at her, and stood transfixed. This was, perhaps, the most terrific onslaught Peggy had ever ventured to make upon him, her natural protector. counsellor, and superior, to whose argu mentative powers she usually yielded the most implicit obedience. It was rebellion \u2014foul and unnatural rebellion\u2014 and the man, partly overwhelmed by this sudden access of feminine ferocity, partly by the strange news which accompanied it, mut tered \u2014 \" W'ery good, ma'rm. Let go \u2014 we'll settle this little matter presently ;\" and then turning to the Squire, resumed his dis cussion with him in a very different key. \" Of course,\" said he, \" if your honour says the gentlefolks are to come, they are to come. But where are we to put 'em V \" Put 'em 1\" said the Squire ; \" why in"], [63, "VALETTA. 55 the \u2014 where should we put 'em \u2014 but in the White Room, man.\" \" The what ! your honour?'' \" The White Room, I say.\" \" The harnted room.\" \" The harnted fiddlestick's end. I don't believe it.\" \"But your honour's own eyes, if you-\" \" I don't care a button \u2014 I tells you, I don't believe it. There arn't nothing of the sort. It's an optician's delusion. I don't believe it. I never did ; and so now I've spoke my mind, at last, and there's an end of it, and be hanged to you.\" \" Your honour don't believe nothing,\" said the man, raising his hands, admir ingly- He was one of that school of philoso phers, was Mr. Jacob, to whom all belief is bondage and all doubt, however irrational, an emancipation from it. \" Not much, Jacob, not much, I take"], [64, "56 VALETTA. it,\" said the old gentleman, rubbing his hands together, cannily and inexpressibly flattered and soothed at this remark. \" Not much,\" he kept murmuring. \"I knows the time o' day pretty well, I do believe.\" In the course of an hour after the old gentleman had settled this little matter to his satisfaction, he dropped off into a sound sleep, and Peggy took the opportu nity to slip away, and get through a little scouring before supper. Jacob, in the meantime, had been on the watch for her, with a full determination of coming to a speedy reckoning with the unfortunate damsel, on the subject of her recent fla grant outrage of all established order. He had very decided notions on the im portance of taking such a step at once, to prevent all future rebellion. This, like much of his other philosophy, he had borrowed from his master. \" Women,\" the old gentleman would say to him, at times, when in an unusually"], [65, "57 VALETTA. amiable and communicative mood \u2014 \" women, my little chap, are best let alone \u2014 least ways, by the likes of you \u2014you can't get down to their depth. However, if ever you ventures \u2014 remember you this \u2014 you can't be too gingery and careful with them. Bring 'em right up with a jerk when ever they get rusty. It stands to reason, it's like dealing with cows, unless you hamper 'em well in the legs, off they goes \u2014 horns down, tail up, full of freaks \u2014 ready for any mischief \u2014 bang they are through your hedges, and, before you can turn, they've eaten their heads off, and done themselves a couple of pounds worth of harm \u2014 and what's worse than all, when once they've broken the hedge, they've always a longing to be in the next field. No \u2014 manage your women while you can, or they'll get the better of you, and do a deal of mischief. Bring 'em up with a jerk, short and sharp, and hamper their legs well \u2014 hamper their legs, I tell you\u2014 or you're never safe.\""], [66, "58 VALETTA. Upon these enlightened and chivalrous notions of the sex, Mr. Jacob had regu lated his conduct towards Peggy, and so frequently and with so sharp a jerk had he taken her up \u2014 so eloquently, learnedly, and perseveringly had he pointed out to her her deficiencies that she at last came to take a sort of gloomy pleasure in hear ing herself abused, and in regarding her self as hopelessly vicious, ignorant, stupid, and generally irreclaimable. Mr. Jacob's manner on these occasions, on which he found it expedient to ad minister a dose of his especial panacea for feminine errors, was happily conceived and striking in the extreme. It was partly derived from half a cen tury's close observation of bis master's conduct, under the various domestic diffi culties which had occurred during that period ; and, to this, which might be con sidered as the solid portion of the edifice, were superadded those lighter and more"], [67, "VALETTA. 59 ornamental graces which sprang up from his own loquacious and didactic tastes. The whole forming a charming compound in which sarcasm and dignified reserve, and abrupt laconicism, and overwhelming pro lixity, in turn struggled for precedence and supremacy. Instinct then with his lofty purpose, Jacob thrust his head in at the parlour door, where Peggy was seated on the hearth cleaning the grate, on one hob of which was her candle, on the other her open spelling-book. \" I shall beg to have the honour of a few moments' conversation with you, ma'rm,\" said Jacob, in accents, the effect of whose measured dignity was somewhat impaired by his at the same moment stepping briskly into the room, and setting his back against the door to prevent his victim's having re course to her not unusual ruse of making a bolt, like the cows to which he compared her. \" May I make bold, ma'rm, to request"], [68, "60 VALETTA. you to have the goodness, ma'rm, to take your eyes off that ignoramus spelling book, and to direct them towards, honoured madam, your obedient humble servant, to command, Jacob Titraan, Esquire.\" \" Well .\" said Peggy, raising her eyes for a moment, and glancing at her tor- mentor, \" well \u2014 there \u2014 I've looked at you.\" And then she settled down again to her brushes and spelling, and murmuring to herself \" flu-i-di-ty, fri-gi-di-ty,\" seemed to forget his presence. Jacob paused for a second, and feeling that the moment had arrived to take her up sharp, cleared his throat, waved his hand in the air, and said \u2014 \" And having looked at me, ma'rm, per mit me to ask what you have seed. \" Stop, don't go a interrupting,\" he said, hastily raising his hand, as his auditor evinced symptoms of stepping into the discussion, and spoiling his pero ration."], [69, "61 VALETTA. \" Have you seed, ma'rm, a man of edica tion \u2014 a man who is looked up to \u2014 a man who has put by money, and who, though I say it, has the honour to be a gentleman as well as a servant out of livery. If not, ma'rm, permit me to ask if you have seed a little wretch whose head you would twist off ; and with kind remembrances to your family circle, I subscribe myself yours respectfully, Jacob Titman, Es- quire.\" Jacob paused for a reply. So long did he pause that it became evident that this harangue was not mere wind, but actually intended to elicit an answer. Peggy therefore raised herself with a grunt, murmuring to herself the while \" Fi-gu-ra-tive, fla-tu-len-cy, for-mi-da ble.\" \" Oh ! bother, can't you let a body be \u2014 without all your fine words. It's quite enough to do all this book learning. What's flatulency V"], [70, "62 VALETTA. Jacob staggered for a moment under this sore and unexpected demand upon his literary resources, but presently made head again, and determined not to let his victim force her way through the toils in that manner, solemnly replied \u2014 \" Flatulency, ma'rm, is all very well in its way, and so is book-learning, but that's neither here nor there. I make bold with polite compliments, to repeat my ques tion.\" In vain \u2014 Peggy was brushing away murmuring \u2014 \u25a0 \" Ex-o-ne-ra-ti-on, ex-pec-to-ra-ti-on, ex pos-tu-la-ti-on.\" \" I make bold, with polite compliments, and kind enquiries after the family, to re peat my question, ma'rm.\" \"Oh ! bother \u2014 don't,\" said Peggy, rising on her knees, and with her elbow sweeping the hair out of her eyes. \" Bother, ma'rm, proves nothing. In short it is a mere part of speech, and one"], [71, "63 VALETTA. I make bold to say, not becoming the mouth of an edicated female.\" '\u2022 I'm not edicated,\" said Peggy, shortly. \" Then, ma'am, you- \u2014 \" \" I tell you what, Jacob,\" said she, in her abrupt jerking way, \" Squire's coming round about my poor child.

Peggy, who was always completely upset by a kind word, at once began to whimper, \" I am sure, Jacob,\" sobbed she, \" it's very good and kind of you to take any notice of the likes of me, and though I may not, perhaps, say so much as I ought, I often think of it.\" Jacob cleared his throat, and was on the point of telling her that she was quite right in doing so, and that she ought in fact to. consider herself a very lucky woman ; but something made him change his mind, and he remained silent. \" I am sure,\" resumed Peggy, opening the old spelling book again, after a pause \u2014 that miserable old tear-be- dabbled book \u2014 \" I am sure I do my best to learn, and I think I could get through this column if you would tell me what Expectora tion\u2014\" But Jacob turned a deaf ear, and walked off, proud of his triumph, and of the tears"], [74, "66 VALETTA. \u2014 those spolia opima of the unfortunate Peggy \u2014 proud of his eloquence, and com placently basking himself in the effulgence of his infinite superiority.

He rends a woman's gentle heart. \" What an eloquent, over powering fellow 1 am,\" he exclaims, as her tears flow. That night there was peace in the house, for hope whispered in every ear, and smoothed down every pillow. Though none could tell what purpose was in the head of that dark, inscrutable old man, still they hoped. It was certain that his mind was travailing on the subject, for in the night, as Peggy watched, she heard him cry in his sleep, \" Twenty-one pair o' boots, let alone slippers. That's what beats me ; oh ! dear.\""], [75, "67 VALETTA. Peggy deemed this so important that she took up her light, and started off with the full intent of waking Rhoda, to inform her of it, and to hear her opinion, which would be decisive on the point. As she opened the nursery door, the child moved in her sleep. Peggy advanced to the bed, shading the light, and peering cautiously over her hand. The smile still wandered over the sleeper's lips, and a soft glow centered in her cheeks, and suffused her neck. Her pillow had moved from under her head, and one of her httle round arms, which had escaped from the confinement of its sleeve, encircled it. Peggy strove gently to replace the pillow, but the arm tightened round it, and the parting lips murmured, \" You've come at last.

About noon on the next day, the unaccus tomed sound of wheels, crunching on the loose gravel in front of the house, called the little garrison to their post, in time to receive the nephew and niece of the Squire, with the distinction to which their near relationship to the autocrat entitled them.

Mr. Jacob, it is to be feared that after all you are \" not much,\" but merely one of that immense body of philosophers who are still busying themselves about tbe follies of their forefathers, and having for the sum and substance of their philosophy that ancient arch-mystery of the transmuta tion of metals \u2014 Philosophers to whom it would be a sore test to offer the choice between wisdom on the one hand, and on"], [80, "72 VALETTA. the other, the pomps and vanities of the world. Philosophers, who, if they admit that wisdom cannot be weighed against the gold of Ophir, and with the precious onyx, or mentioned in the same breath with coral or pearls, admit it in a sense very different from that of the prophet, who originally instituted the comparison. It certainly must be admitted, that this arrival was by no means to be compared with that never-to-be-forgotten advent of the Captain, with which it was naturally contrasted in the mind of the Squire's factotum. The old fly rattled and shivered in the breeze ; the gaunt old horse twisted its legs up together, and went to sleep, while the driver sat gloomily on his box with a dogged, desperate presentiment that he should not get more than his fare. \" Here,\" said he, to Jacob, handing down a small carpet bag, and one of those black"], [81, "73 VALETTA, leather boxes which are supposed to con tain the apparatus for feminine conjura tions, \" there, catch hold. They're a rum lot, I reckon.\" Mr. Jacob, having saved money, and being, as he had already taken occasion to observe, a gentleman as well as a servant out of livery, was not the sort of person to be addressed in this cavalier fashion by a mere driver of flys ; when therefore he had placed the carpet-bag and box in the hall he returned to the disaffected flyman. \" Is there anything more to come?\" said he. \" No !\" replied the flyman, gloomily. \" Then I'll thank you to keep your re marks to yourself, my man,\" said Jacob.

The beast suddenly woke up, untied his legs, and, under the impression that it was within a mile of home, made a couple of hearty steps in advance, and the Honoura ble Mr. Stiltmarche, who had just made up his mind to the effort of getting himself out of the fly, and into the nearest arm chair, came shooting headlong out of the vehicle in the very middle of a yawn. The driver cursed the horse, the Honoura ble gentleman cursed the driver, while a voice from the mildewed interior of the fly cried \u2014 <; Go in, John, and leave him to me.\" The driver moved uneasily in his seat, for he felt that this was the voice which would argue with him the all important question of \" fare,\" and though it was a feminine voice, there was something about its sharp, decisive intonation which seemed to say with painful decision of accent \u2014 \" I am not to be taken in ;\" aDd it is a"], [83, "75 VALETTA. matter of notoriety in his, and in many other professions, that when a woman is determined not to be taken in, she is much more difficult to deal with than the most obdurate of the other sex. The Honourable Mrs. Stiltmarche descended from the fly. She had on a brown merino dress, a sombre plaid shawl, and a coarse straw bonnet with a staid ribbon. In her hand she carried a basket, from beneath the cover of which, peeped out the neck of a bottle and the extremities of several small parcels. So strangely was she disguised that she might have been mistaken for her own maid. Indeed, it was from her maid's wardrobe that the materials for this mas querading expedition had been fur nished. When she had put on this unusual dress, she had resolved to assume with it a new cha racter ; and, as a first effort at sustaining her part, she entered into a long and obstinate E 2"], [84, "76 VALETTA. wrangle on the question of payment \u2014 of fering a ridiculously small portion of the ridiculously large amount claimed by the unfortunate driver. At the commencement of this wrangle her husband, who hated a broil, had turned on his heel, and following Jacob, had been conducted by him into the parlour, where he looked about him, sighed, threw himself into a chair, and pulled out his watch. \" What time do you get luncheon here V said he, with a yawn. \" Any time you like, sir. What will you please to take, sir V replied Jacob, with a ready voice, and an indistinct recollection of having seen a fragment of cheese some where a few days before. \" Well, I don't care,\" said the visitor, \" I am not particular. Anything you hap pen to have. A glass of Madeira and a bit of cold pheasant, would do very well. I suppose you dine early V At this moment the lady, having finally"], [85, "77 VALETTA. routed her enemy, bustled into the room. \" A glass of Madeira and a pheasant '.\" she exclaimed. \" Do speak seriously. Re member that our friend Jacob does not know you so well as I do, and might think you really mean what you say.\" \" Mean ! why so I \u2014 so I \u2014 so I really do believe he does,\" stammered the hus band, suddenly catching a rapid admoni tory glance, which gave him his cue. And so Jacob undoubtedly did ; and when he found that he was mistaken, and that he was iu the midst of half sentences, and nods, and frowns, he became confused ; and conceiving that he had committed some great error, made bold to beg par don. \"No, Jacob, not at all \u2014 no offence in the world \u2014 you'll know us better, some day, I hope,\" said the lady. \" We're quiet people with simple habits, and cheerful \u2014 naturally enough \u2014 fond of a joke now and then.

There's not much difficulty in that. They are no great things, I see \u2014 they can't be, or else they'd never call for bread and water.

Treat your friends. Spend your money, and what do you come to 1 Why, it stands to reason \u2014 it ends in toast and water. Bah ! sir ! \u2014 (another dig) \u2014 I'm sick of the thing.\" And here, unwilling to carry out any further this melancholy subject of contem plation, Jacob chipped off a tempting knob of crust \u2014 the very morsel of the loaf which had all along engrossed his atten tion, and to which he may be said to have more especially directed his remarks, put it into his mouth and took up lunch. In the meantime, in the parlour, things had not remained stagnant.

As this worthy entered with the luncheon"], [92, "84 VALETTA. tray there was an expression in the face of the lady, which had he been less intently occupied with himself, and his own imagi nings could hardly have failed to inspire him with caution. There was about her firmly clenched jaw, and-deep set mouth a strong hint of that determined reckless purpose for which her race was remarkable, blended with that feminine finesse of dissimulation which the unworthy members of her sex can superadd to their other qualities. \"Jacob,\" said she, \"I confess I am almost surprised to see you still in service ; I should have hoped that by this time you would have succeeded in setting aside a little competence for your older days.\" Jacob was on his metal in a moment, and fulfilling the fate of all hasty men, at once fell into the snare. \" Yes, ma'am \u2014 yes, thank you \u2014 As to competence, I'm pretty well off \u2014 I believe 1 could retire to-morrow, if the Squire could do without me\u2014 but he can't ma'am"], [93, "85 VALETTA. \u2014 \u00ab Bless you, he'd be as helpless as a child.\" \" Ah !\" said the lady. \" Indeed!\" \" Yes, ma'am, without me \u2014 It's I ma'am who keep things going \u2014 It's I who manage every thing, and understand the estate \u2014 Perhaps if anything should happen to the old gentleman, I may one day purchase a little corner of the land, and end my days in sight of the old house.\" \" I suppose you don't happen to have any anchovies in the house,\" said the gentleman, starting up from a sort of slumber into which this conversation had at once lulled him. \" No, sir ! We've some Dutch cheese,\" said Jacob. \" Ah ! the deuce \u2014 I forgot,\" said the gentleman, hastily, \" never mind \u2014 it is of no consequence.\" \" Not the least,\" said the lady, with a bland smile, \" We shall do very well now, Jacob\u2014 for a beginning, that is to say \u2014 you can go now and \u2014 \""], [94, "86 VALETTA. \" Beg pardon ma'am,\" said Jacob, un easily, \" but as to what I've been saying, perhaps his honour would n't best like to hear it, because \u2014 \" \" Yes, Jacob, certainly,\" interrupted the lady, \" I understand you, \u2014 and Jacob \u2014 \" \" Ma'am.\" \" When my uncle can see me for a few minutes, I will just step up to him.\" \" And in the mean time,\" said the gen tleman, \" you may as well unpack my things.\" Jacob retired with a vague, uneasy sen sation that he had committed himself, which would force its way in spite of the bluster with which he asserted to himself that he had let some folks see that he was not to be trodden upon, and that he was as good a man as some folks who held their heads a good deal higher. This was scene the first, of the little drama which the lady had proposed to herself, aud everything had occurred just as she had desired."], [95, "VALETTA. 87 Presently the parlour bell rang again for the commencement of the second part. and the bland lady requested Jacob to favour her by giving her compliments to Mrs. Franko, and saying that she should like to have the pleasure of seeing her dear little cousin, Miss Rhoda, whenever it might be perfectly convenient to every body. In consequence of this request, Mrs. Franko shortly appeared with a glowing face, and a holiday cap, leading by the hand Miss Rhoda, herself beautified by the art of her nurse, and still more so by her own diffident blushes. \"Thank you, Mrs. Franko,\" said the lady, with a bow, and a sweet smile on her lips. \" And I am sure, as far as I can judge of my dear young cousin from her appearance, we may all thank you\u2014 that is, all the family may thank you for the care and attention which you have evi dently bestowed upon her. That will do, Mrs. Franko.\""], [96, "88 VALETTA. Peggy dropped her lowest curtsey, and felt, with particularly uncomfortable dis tinctness, that after all, there was \" a family,\" that is to say that there were other people who had a right to take more interest than herself in her clear little charge, and a right to claim in return a rival share in her affections. \" Come here, my dear,\" said the lady to the child. Rhoda advanced with hesitation \u2014 the least in the world, but well noted by Peggy- \" Kiss me,\" said the lady, coldly. The child's lips rested for a second on her cheek. \" That will do, my dear, you can sit down ; Mrs. Franko you can go.\" As the lady inclined her head, Peggy coloured up, and curtseyed and stumbled back to the door, and finally out of the room. When she got half way up stairs she began to think that she did not like all this ;"], [97, "VALETTA. 89 and when she had seated herself on the land ing, and turned the matter over in her mind, she arrived, in due course of time, at the not able conclusion that she wondered why people could not let them alone, without coming bothering after them ; to speculate upon which subsidiary proposition she found it necessary to shut herself up in the nur sery. \" What a horse of a woman,\" involun tarily exclaimed the Honourable John, as his astonished eye followed Teggy to the parlour-door. His wife, almost before the words were out of his mouth, directed away the atten tion ofthe child, but not sufficiently rapidly however, to prevent them from reaching her. Affection has keen ears, and keen re sentments, and from that moment Rhoda sedulously shunned the man whose bad taste and bad fortune had led him to ex press in her presence so disparaging an opinion of her darling Peggy."], [98, "90 VALETTA. Thus was the gentleman summarily ex pelled from the good graces of the young lady, and a very unfortunate thing for her was it, for he was a good-natured and not actively dishonourable man \u2014 indeed, ac cording to a certain code, he was a strictly honourable man ; and in the events which soon followed his arrival, had he been but appealed to by her, he might have been of the greatest assistance. \" And now,\" said the lady, extending her hand to Rhoda, \"you must promise to love me. Will you not ?\" The child silently placed her hand in the woman's, and gazed into her eyes with an earnestness which was almost discon certing. It is a serious matter to a child, that of loving and love pledges, and the little Rhoda eagerly scanned the features of her who thus made a new claim on her affections, to ascertain how far she could conscientiously respond to it. \" And who gave you that pretty brooch with the hair in it,\" said the lady."], [99, "91 VALETTA. Still Rhoda was silent, and this time she shook her head. \" Who was it, my little dear V \" Some one I must not name,\" replied the child thus urged, and as she spoke, the tears stood in her eyes. \" A nd why must not you name the person V \" Dear grandpapa does not allow it.\" \" Oh ! very well ; and can you play the piano V said the lady. \" No, ma'am.\" \" Or speak French ?\" \" No, ma'am.\" \" Can you dance V \" No, ma'am.\" And each time that Rhoda admitted her deficiency, she sank lower and lower in her own estimation, until at last, when Mrs. Stiltmarche again shook her by the hand, and told her that now she might go, and that ' she was a very good little girl, she felt that what the lady said was quite true \u2014 that her own cherished private opinion"], [100, "92 VALETTA. that she was growing up and becoming al most a young woman, was a delusion, and that she was after all a little girl \u2014 a very little girl indeed. \" And now,\" said the lady, turning to her husband, with a triumphant flash in her eyes, as the door closed upon the child, \" now then, mark my words, in a week the field is our own, until then adieu.\" \" Why, where the deuce are you going ? I can't stay here by myself, Laura,\" cried the alarmed husband. \"And do you suppose that 1 am not going to fare worse than yourself. Do you suppose that I would ask you to do any thing without myself doing ten times as much. Am I not going to pass day and night on the boards of that sick room. You think\u2014\" \" But suppose there is no bed V \" Bed ! Voila let, hommes !\" \" But, Laura, my dear girl, consider the privation.

CHAPTER V While these matters were passing in the parlour below, the Squire was, on his side, preparing himself for the worthy reception of his niece, for whom, and for whose social position he had, in spite of his as sumed contempt for the ways of the world, no small consideration. There are none who so much respect and reverence the world as those who the most sedulously remove themselves from it. It is the just punishment of their seclu-"], [104, "96 VALETTA. sion to see it in the unreal brilliancy which distance lends. To them it is as bright and beautiful as a planet seen from afar. And what a pure, bright, brilliant phenomenon must be this globe of ours to the poets and philosophers of the moon ! How it must be apostrophized as \" yon pure and peaceful orb which looks down upon the troubles of our busy life !\" That is what this fermenting gas-evolving planet of ours may seem at a distance, and so seems the brilliant world of men and affairs to those who shrink from honestly taking their appointed share in its toils and pleasures. The old gentleman had a decided impres sion that fashion and social eminence as well as all other matters not directly and immediately convertible into money, might be set down by a candid and enlightened philosophy as all \" fiddlestick's end ;\" never theless, he had, on tbe other hand, a coun terpoising impression that there must be something very well worth having in that"], [105, "VALETTA. 97 which even money itself could not pur chase. Accordingly, with the assistance of his factotum Jacob, he proceeded to what he called \" titivate \" himself, that he might present a becoming appearance in the ap proaching interview with his fair and dis tinguished relative. This process consisted in substituting for the old yellow bandana the white neck-cloth of other days, and in slipping on an old brown great coat in lieu of the flannel jacket. \" I feel uncommon strong and hearty, Jacob,\" said the Squire, after this operation was satisfactorily completed, *' I've a mind to get up, and go down.\" \" Better wait till Doctor Scammony comes back, your honour,\" said the facto tum, with a shake of the head. \" Ugh !

And now give my duty to my kddy, and I shall be happy to see her for a quarter of an hour or so.\" After Jacob had left the room to fulfil his master's order?, the Squire leaned back, and closed his eyes. \" Ah !\" murmured he. \" It's them one and twenty pair o' boots as sticks in my gizzard.

And if the old gentleman had at that moment actually, as well as metaphorically, felt forty-two heels crunching and grinding in Lis vitals, he could not Lave given a"], [109, "101 VALETTA. heartier groan than that with which he accompanied this exclamation. Presently there came a gentle knock at the door. Enter the honourable Mrs. Stiltmarche. Simple bonnet, plain shawl, coarse dress, gentle tone, soft smile, and all \u2014 and under it the iron Hardyman soul. \" Dearest uncle,\" began the lady. \" What a heart-rending \u2014 \" \" Hope I see you werry well, my leddy,\" broke in the old gentleman, in an abrupt tone. \" I hate palavering,\" said he to himself. \" It's precious dear work. People don't go a buttering bread, unless they intends to have a slice out of it.\" If he had said it out loud, the lady could scarcely have caught his meaning more quickly, and more accurately. In an instant she re-commenced her symphony in a much lower key. \"I am sorry to find you in bed, uncle.\""], [110, "102 VALETTA. \" Sorry I can't get up to welcome your leddyship. \" Oh don't think of that for a single instant, uncle.\" \" Howsomedever, I've left a bottle o' wine out, and hope you'll not stint yourselves any more than if I was up.\" The lady murmured inarticulate thanks. A pause, during which the old man kept his eyes and mouth obstinately shut, while the lady took the opportunity to glance at him, and calculate the progress which decay had made in his frame. Presently the Squire, having gulped down the ill-humour \u2014 which what he considered as an attempt to palaver him had aroused \u2014 said, \" You're from foreign parts, my leddy ?\" \" Yes, uncle. We arrived in London yesterday by the steam boat from Calais.\" \" Ah !\" murmured the old gentleman. \" I don't take much account of steam boats,,\""], [111, "VALETTA. 103 \" And from thence to Benchurch by the railroad.\" \"Nor of them neither,\" murmured the old gentleman. ''We had none of your new fangled jim-cracks a tearing through the country, and cutting up the land in Billy Pitt's time, and he knew the time of day pretty well, as most people allow, except your steam gun makers, and railway directors.

The old gentleman, however, did not seem particularly curious to hear the an swer. Perhaps he doubted the value of"], [112, "104 VALETTA. his niece's information. At any rate, he presently began to branch off into a long rigmarole rhapsody, half soliloquy, half protest before witness \u2014 the burden of which was to the effect that things could not go on much longer ; and that, in the meantime, (to borrow the phrase of a living philosopher) we were eating each other up like mulligrubs \u2014 that, with our rates and taxes, we couldn't stand agin foreign parts, where it was pretty generally allowed the State cultivated the land, and the farmer reaped it, and the whole ending by a vague request to be carted off to the work'us and have done with it. Having delivered himself to this effect, the Squire turned on his pillow, with his face to the wall, and began to murmur that he was tired of life, and thought he should like to take a good nap, and that he wished my leddy a wery good morning \u2014 which all led my leddy to the conclusion that, if she intended to make any way with the old"], [113, "105 VALETTA. gentleman, it was desirable to begin at once. One preliminary step, however, was ne cessary. All this time Peggy Franko, who seemed to have a general impression that whenever no more pressing duties called her elsewhere, her post was at her master's side, had been seated on the floor. On ordinary occasions Peggy was consi dered as a species of dumb waiter ; and, indeed, it might be added dumb washer, duster, scourer \u2014 dumb and uncomplaining hewer of wood, and drawer of water, to the establishment ; and, on ordinary oc casions, this was all very well \u2014 but, at the present moment, it was necessary to re move her. \" Uncle,\" whispered the lady, \" if there is anything for Mrs. Franko to do \u2014 any work unfinished \u2014 I shall be glad to sit with you while she is absent.\" \" Work !\" said the Squire, turning round F 5"], [114, "106 VALETTA in his bed. \" Work?

Then go and find some thing to do ; my leddy is kind enough to take your place here. Get ye gone, lass.\" Peggy went creaking out of the room, upsetting a chair in her progress.

If the poor child were but safe back again, how happy we should all be.\" This was what Peggy, the ignoramus, thought, as a great tear fell down on that unfortunate spelling book of hers. \" Oh ! bother,\" cried she, dashing it away, \" I shall never be a scholard at this rate.\" Ah ! Peggy, there are few scholars whose scholarship extends to the shedding of such a tear as that! \" It's a good lass,\" said the Squire, as Peggy closed the door after her. \" Mrs Franko seems a very valuable sort of person, and quite fit for her present position of superintending her other servants,\" said the lady, in a soft voice. \" Hulloa !\" cried the old gentleman. \" What do you mean .

There was a pause. \" There is an end of that,\" said the lady to herself. \" Now then for the next.\" \" Uncle.\" \" My leddy.\" \" We have a servant- \u2014 two, in fact \u2014 every one is obliged to have some ser vants.\" \" More's the pity,\" growled the old gen tleman. \" One of them is a man \u2014 very useful \u2014 understands cooking, and everything ; in case you want any little thing he might be of service.\" \"Oh !

The fact was, he was weighing the pro bable advantage to be got out of the ser vants, in one scale, and the expense of their keep, in the other ; and when he had made up his mind to accept the offer, he did not like to appear too eager on the matter, fearing that if his niece thought she had laid him under an obligation, she would make that the foundation of some request on her own account. \" Well, I don't know, my leddy,\" said he, scratching his ear; \"the fact is, little"], [120, "112 VALETTA.

As soon as this became apparent, the niece drew out a small pocket-book, and wrote with a pencil on one of its leaves in French. \" I have established myself \u2014 Have over the woman immediately.

The door gently opened. \" Mrs. Franko,\" said the soft voice of the lady. \" Yes ! miss,\" replied the startled Peggy. \" You will have the goodness to give that to the gentleman down stairs. Put it into his hands yourself.

This interesting specimen of her craft arrived at Norley Court in the course of the afternoon, and at once ascended to the theatre of her future operations \u2014 the sick room of the poor old Squire. As she entered, her mistress smiled, shook hands with her, and pointed to a chair, in which, having first taken off her bonnet and shawl, she seated herself. She was a middle-aged, light-haired, damp looking woman with a restless brown eye, and an eager trembling hand. On her head was a plain close cap, and the whole of the rest of her dress was on the same scale of extreme simplicity, having been, like that of her mistress, studiously arranged for the occasion \u2014 Dress is always more or less the expression of a woman's mind, and never were caps more elaborately VOL.

Mrs. Vowlett's sidelong glance passed over the room, resting nowhere yet missing nothing except the Squire, who lay rolled up in his sheets pretending to be in a heavy sleep, and in reality out of the corner of one eye, and through a little artfully de vised tunnel in his counterpane, engaged in scrutinizing the new comer. There is a freemasonry in deceit as well as in other crafts, and probably the soubrette divined that the old gentleman was watch ing her, for she appeared quite unconscious of his presence \u2014 much in the same sort of way as the big serpent at the Zoological Gardens which gazes up to the ceiling in a fit of abstraction when the rabbit hops on to its tail. Presently the women began to whisper together. \" Ah !\" thought the Squire, from his ambush. \" Go it \u2014 You're a calcilating when the old man '11 be took away \u2014 like"], [131, "123 VALETTA. the rest on 'em I'll lay a farden \u2014 But he's not gone yet, and may be won't drop off quite so easy after all.\" So long as we are young we speculate freely enough on death, for threescore and ten is far distant \u2014 and what imagined death ever took place earlier than that allotted limit \u2014 but as the tekmairion emar, the fated day, comes on we approach the sub ject in periphrases. In proportion as the idea of death fixes itself on the mind, the word death is banished from the lips \u2014 To the man to whom the fancy that dissolution is far distant serves as a sort of immortality \u2014 to that man \u2014 the mere knowledge that it is certainly at hand is in itself the beginning of death. The Squire for some time continued to watch the women as they whispered on arranging the plan of their campaign, and then, at last having stoutly declared to him self over and over again that he was im- G 2"], [132, "124 VALETTA. mortal, he dropped off to sleep ; for he was in reality feeble enough, and the excite ment of the day had exhausted him. In about an hour he woke again, half forgetting what had occurred, and confusing it with his own dreams \u2014 Sleep is the waking life of the infants of the pap-spoon and the crutch \u2014 for then the vacant hours and the dazzling sunlight are succeeded by visions of we know not what, or by fond reminiscences of the past \u2014 of a fairy past in which the events happen over again as our regrets would wish them to have happened. When the watchful lady saw that the old man was arousing himself she glided to his bedside, and said, in a gentle, caressing voice \u2014 \" Here is Vowlett. my maid, come to nurse you, uncle \u2014 And now I'll leave you fur a little to make her acquaintance, while I go and attend to the house.\" \" Werry good, my leddy,\" said the Squire."], [133, "125 VALETTA. And the lady left the room. \" I hope I see you well, ma'rm,\" said the Squire, turning to the new arrival. \" I hope we shall see you better soor, sir,\" said the maid, with ready aposte, and dropping a curtsey. \" Humph !\" said the old man, dubiously. \" You're werry good, ma'am \u2014 I'm sure \u2014 What's your name?\" \" Vowlett, sir.\" Another curtsey, which seemed to add \u2014 \" And very much at your honour's service!\" \" Wowlett \u2014 oh! wery good \u2014 Mrs. Wow lett, how's the wind?\" The soubrette looked puzzled \u2014 Naturally enough \u2014 She came from a realm of brick and mortar where the wiud occasionally rattled in a chimney-pot, but beyond that, did not force itself upon the attention.

Further than this you might as well have asked her the"], [134, "126 VALETTA. moon's declination, or her views on the nebu lar theory. The old gentleman, finding that she was unable to answer, struggled up in his bed. \" Ah !\" said he, casting his eyes out of window. \" ah ! I thought as much. Due west.\" He sank back on his pillow, and mur mured to himself \u2014 \" Dead against a wessel from foreign parts \u2014 everything against a poor, old, bed-ridden man.\" Then he said aloud \u2014 \" Has the postman been, ma'rm .\" \" Yes, sir \u2014 he has passed.

Tears ! They were the first he had shed for many and many a long day. Aye \u2014 and many a long year too. When had he shed a tear before? Perhaps, never. He certainly could not have remembered when. He was human then after all \u2014 with a human heart. The rock was struck, and living water was to flow. The new nurse, though she noted not the tear, saw a moisture in the old man's eye, and the relaxation of his whole face. She was up in an instant. In answer to her inquiries, and demands to know the exact seat and nature of his"], [136, "128 VALETTA. new symptoms, he shook his head woefully, and would only reply. \" I feel uncommon queer, ma'rm \u2014 weak like \u2014 precious weak \u2014 for a man as knows what's what.\" Queer! weak! Here was just the case for a nurse to manage, then. Before the old gentleman could say more she had him down bounce upon his pillow, had that active nurse ; and before he could recover himself sufficiently to struggle or cry for mercy, she had wound a napkin round his throat \u2014 had thrust a dose of medicine into his mouth\u2014 had washed his face \u2014 brushed his hair \u2014 arranged his sheets \u2014 shaken his pillows \u2014 and, at last, sprinkling the contents of an eau de Cologne bottle over him, asked him, in ac cents the most petting, wheedling, and conciliatingly sympathetic \u2014 \" How he felt now, poor dear?\" \"Piff!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, expelling the breath from his lungs. \" Odd rabbit it ! Piff ! what a precious stench !\""], [137, "129 VALETTA \"Djesn't he like the eau de Cologne? Then he shan't have it \u2014 that he shan't.\" And down went the old gentleman again \u2014 off went the flannel jacket \u2014 off went the white neck-cloth \u2014 -off went everything, which had imbibed the obnoxious scent, and there he was, in a twinkling, in bed, lying down, comfortably tucked in, with his nurse hanging over him, a vinaigrette in one hand, and a basin of gruel in the other. \" And does he like that better \\ and will he take his gruel like a dear, good gentle man to please his nurse ? and will he smell that to do him good?

That gentleman happened in the course of his duties to be engaged in descending the stairs \u2014 a remarkable operation into which he succeeded in throwing much of the dignity of his natural character, and of the importance of his official position. It chanced that on the landing half way down he was met by an immense basket of linen, from behind which were visible the ruddy arms of the inexhaustible Peggy.

She began, according to rule, by step ping forward and tripping herself up. Saving herself from a fall by clinging to the banisters, and retreating she stumbled over the basket, and finally rested with her back against an old walnut-wood press on the landing. These pro formd preliminaries being gone through, she came at once to the matter in hand. \"Jacob,\" said she. They can't let us be.

At this sight, seizing her basket, she proceeded upwards on her course, merely uttering this simple valedictory formula. \"Ob! bother!\" \"Ah!\" sighed Jacob. \"What a heap of old washed out prejudices \u2014 what an ignoramus that woman is. Ah ! go your ways, you precious non compos, the march of mind can't tread on your toes and wake you up, I reckon.\" \" Jacob,\" said the lady pausing, as she arrived at the spot where the little man stood. \"Ma'am?\" \" You have been some time in this house.\" \" Five and forty years, ma'am, man and bov, ma'am.\""], [142, "134 VALETTA. \"It is my uncle's wish and express de sire that on this day month, Jacob, you leave his house and service.

Now the exterior of this particular letter was of the most seductive character. There was a crispness about the seal as if it would break of its own accord, and shame the hesitation of the receiver's hand. A little spot of wax had fallen by its side which might possibly have been set down as mean ing that the writer was hurried or careless, or absent in thoughf,had it not been at once discerned that it meant, most unmistakeably, that under its little symbol the writer sent the thousands of kisses long accumulating in arrear."], [144, "136 VALETTA. In short the letter was turned over and over, and gazed at and kissed according to precedent, and the direction scanned and construed, and the latent meaning in the dots of the i's, and the unhappiness hinted at in the delicate up strokes, the resignation iu the firmer down strokes, the ray of hope still lingering in the loops of the y's, all expounded to Peggy, and made out as clearly as an ambiguous clause in a will, or a particle in a Greek chorus, or as any other matter in which the learned, and those interested \" in that behalf\" \u2014 the quacks in Court and College \u2014 every day so successfully \" find out meanings never meant.\" Resist the devil, and he will flee from you \u2014 or may do so \u2014 but if you want to be quite safe flee fiom him, and leave resist ance to those who are not afraid to risk a fall.

The letter (they hardly knew how) came open \u2014 They read it, they re-read it, they hid it away, and every now and then brought it out again. They felt very guilty, but they clung to the letter and to each other all the more. The contents supplied an inexhaustible magazine of con jecture, and there is no manner in which the feminine mind more delights to exer cise itself, and no matter which affords it more satisfactory information. Like the Delphic oracle, or a popular lecturer, it explained every thing did this letter. It adapted itself to every contin gency and every capacity, and there it was, after all, quite unexhausted \u2014 as fresh and new, and ambiguous and suggestive as ever. Now it happened, as it usually happens to those whom a certain historical per sonage, above referred to, has first led into"], [146, "138 VALETTA. temptation, and whom he afterwards turns round and betrays to punishment. These two guilty creatures were in the very act of criminally referring to this precious and secret document when the nursery door gently opened, and Mrs. Stilt marche, fresh from her little interview with Jacob, stood before them. To shut down the lid of the little box from within which, with a view to some such sudden emergency, the letter was seldom totally withdrawn, was but the work of about a couple of seconds, but had it occupied only the smallest fraction of a second, the effort at concealment would have been in vain. Not a word from Mrs. Stiltmarche's lips \u2014 not a glance from her eye, betokened the slightest recognition of what had passed. She turned coldly to Rhoda, who stood blushing and trembling before her. \" Have you been out for a walk to-day, child,\" said she, in accents which were"], [147, "139 VALETTA. as frigidly restorative to her self-pos session as cold water itself would have been. It appeared that Rhoda had not been out. \" Why has not this child been out for a walk to-day,\" said the lady, turning her undemonstrative glance on poor Peggy. \" Take her immediately.\" \" I didn't\u2014\" \" Very well, then, take the child im mediately.\" The two prepared for their walk \u2014 the new mistress sitting with her eyes intently fixed on them the while. In whichever direc tion they turned, they felt that that cold, scrutinizing gaze was following them, judg ing every movement. \" Good bye, dear cousin,\" said Rhoda, with a blush \u2014 for the first time in her life the language of affection came with an ef fort from her lips. \" Good morning child,\" said the lady,"], [148, "140 VALETTA. \" When you come in again I shall want you in the parlour, and mind I won't have you go near your grandpapa to disturb him \u2014 When he wants to see you / will let you know.\" Who was this new mistress ? By what commission did she act . Why were they thus deprived of their privilege of ap proaching their invalid ? Alas ! They were too well accustomed to obey to challenge her authority. Had a stranger knocked at the door and said ' do this,' they would have done it, and this is one of the most certain aud worst conse quences of a rule like the Squire's. Still a doubt rose in their minds, and this for them was not a little. As they descended the stairs they found Jacob there, leaning against the old walnut wood press \u2014 his hands behind his back, his head raised to the ceiling. He had scarcely moved since the 'moment when he had re futed Peggy. The fact was he had been"], [149, "141 VALETTA. effectually nailed to the spot by the little clenching speech of Madame Sriltmarche, and there he remained like a disreputable little carrion crow against a barn door, a warning to all comers. Peggy paused to gaze at this strange spectacle. Jacob suddenly brought his head down and stretched out his hand to her. She took it. Rhoda looked at her, and never did her great wondering eyes express greater wonder than when she saw a deep flush spread itself over that extraordinary Peggy's face. \" I hope nothing has happened,\" said Teggy, in a low trembling voice. \" Nothing,\" said Jacob ; \" I tell you what Peggy,\" he added, after a moment's pause, \" I was wrong \u2014 any one may be wrong once \u2014 You were right \u2014 any one may be right once.

Rhoda and her nurse, the faithful Teggy, having been ordered forth to take the air by the kind consideration of the great lady from foreign parts, who had condescended to step down and put everything to rights in this humble household, strolled out into the fields, and as they walked on they wondered and speculated and prayed for the return of Scammony.

No one however could give them any tidings or say when he might be expected to return. He had not written, and no one knew where he was. He might come in a few weeks. He might be still away for months, for before starting he had made arrangements for a prolonged absence. Nothing very satisfactory in that quar- ter. Neither was there anything very satis factory to poor Rhoda in the interview which, on their return, she had with her aunt. That lady had not been idle during their absence. No sooner had the pair of mal contents fairly left the house than she had again found her way to the nursery. Tbe little, red, toy trunk was the object of her visit. This was the most sacred repository of all Rhoda 's treasures. It had been long before purchased at a Benchurch fair, and so elaborate was its"], [153, "145 VALETTA. construction, that it even boasted of a lock and key. This lock and key was naturally the very kernel of the whole affair, and added infinite zest to the possession. For a long time, Rhoda wore the key round her neck, suspended by a black ribbon. It gave such a sense of security. In process of time, the key was naturally mislaid, then came the difficulty, how was the box to be opened. Necessity, as usual, was the mother of a very numerous family of inventions to accomplish this object. Among her progeny, a steel fork \u2014 a silver spoon \u2014 a large pin \u2014 the tongs \u2014 the poker \u2014 the thumb and forefinger were found to answer the purpose the most com pletely \u2014 nevertheless, the young lady's faith in her treasure chest remained un diminished, and when the tremendous con spiracy of the foreign letter was hatched, this miniature, red-leather chest was voted by Peggy and herself to be the very place of VOL.

And they were right, for never yet had the foot of any one passed over the threshold of that room, who would have deemed it possible to force through that tiny obstacle which could not even have re sisted the finger of an infant. It was like the seal of a letter, whose feeble barrier, the honour of those through whose hands it passes, renders impreg nable. Even the Squire had a code of honour of his own. The Squire's niece, having listened, for a moment, to assure herself from interruption, made straight for the box, and without an instant's hesitation, or an instant's mis giving, forced opened the lock, and turning out the little litter of cherished trifles, seized upon the letter, and spreading it open, with trembling hands, proceeded to read as follows \u2014"], [155, "147 VALETTA. \"Dearest Rhody, \" It is very wrong of me to write to you, but I hope you will forgive me, and read my letter.

It was dusk when Rhoda returned from her walk. Jacob, with a very grave face, informed her that the new come lady desired to speak to her immediately in the parlour. Rhoda entered, and found her cousin seated before the fire, into whose depth she was gazing vacantly. As soon as she became aware of the pre sence of the trembling and hesitating child, her eye lighted up. \"Come here,\" said she, in a harsh, abrupt tone of command. \" Stand upright if you can \u2014 You stoop frightfully. You are positively quite deformed.\" Rhoda blushed, distorted herself into a dancing position, and stood up before her judge. \" What do you know ?\" said the lady. If she had yielded to her impulse, she would have burst into tears, and replied that she knew nothing, and was sorry that she had offended any one.

It is a bad sign when a child dare not look one in the face \u2014 a very bad sign indeed. And a sign, which in your case, I am sorry to say is but too true. Your wicked conduct in receiving letters in express opposition to your dear, good, and too indulgent grand papa's desires has been discovered \u2014 and I have found it my duty to lay the matter before him. It has naturally shocked him very much \u2014 very much indeed. He has been worse ever since \u2014 very much worse.\" The child was beginning. \" Don't interrupt.

This courtly animal seemed to have laid it down as a general rule of policy to con ciliate whoever might, for the time being, have the power of ejecting her from her place at the hearth. Accordingly she was the only member of the household not at direct issue with the new-come lady. Juno, however, now seemed to feel that there was anger brewing against the child \u2014 her old patroness \u2014 and ventured so far out of her usual line as to attempt a slight effort in her favour. Quirk would have done more \u2014 Quirk would have barked, and jumped, and bristled honestly ; but alas! Quirk was no longer a member of the household. Imme diately after the catastrophe of the mar riage, the Squire had given orders that he"], [161, "153 VALETTA. should be at once executed, and he had only been rescued from impending fate by being hurried off in secret to Doctor Scammony's who, from that time, became his proprie tor. Juno then, selfish as she was, determined on some interposition in favour of poor Rhoda, against whom those anijry tones were elevated, and with a little piteous whine, she approached the lady, and looking up mournfully in her face, began to paw gently at her dress. At first, the lady took no heed of this ; but when the poor beast's supplications at length amounted to a positive interruption to her discourse, she raised her little foot, and launched forth a hearty blow into the middle of its face There was something in this which shocked poor Rhoda ineffably, and much as she strove to repress it, a single silent tear would roll down her cheek. \" I see you are beginning to give way to your wicke 1 temper, child,\" said the lady ; H 5"], [162, "154 VALETTA, \" now get you gone to your nursery, and mind you don't venture to stir from it until you have a French verb ready to repeat to me.\" As the child went sobbing forth from the room, Jacob chanced to pass and see her. He hurried rapidly by, for he would not for worlds have seemed to observe the condition in which she was ; but when he got to his own especial realms, he turned up his eyes and hands, aud long and loudly declared that all these doings were enough to raise the ghost. If they might have raised a ghost, they seemed to have no effect in arousing Mr. Hardyman. The last spark of that energy which had so lately inspired the old gentleman, weak and suffering as he was, to attempt the superintendence of his affairs, seemed to have altogether vanished.

As the frightened domestics lingered in the neighbouring passages, they would be come aware that at intervals the sick room door was gently opened, and that a light foot stepped out into the passage, and that some one listened.

At times Mrs. Vowlett, the newly con stituted nurse, would leave the sick room for a few minutes in search of some article required. There was an anxious look about her face, her hands trembled nervously, and she glanced suspiciously at Jacob and Peggy as they stood scrutinizing her countenance to gather from it the hope and comfort of which all stood in so much need. At last finding that she remained silent, and was about to leave them again, they would venture to ask her how their master was getting on. She would shake her head and sigh, and tinning her eyes towards the ceiling wo#ld say that they must all hope for the best, but that he was very low and weak. And then when she saw the two ex changing sympathising glances she would stop and colour up, and ask Jacob, sharply, if he had anything to say, and if he meant that her mistress was not doing the best that could be done for the poor old gentle-"], [165, "157 VALETTA. man. And when Jacob replied that he did not doubt it, she would reply \u2014 \" Very well then, why had he looked at her in that way?\" At times too Rhoda would make a des perate effort to know something about the condition of this dear old man whom she so fondly loved. She was now almost entirely confined to the nursery, but when she at rare intervals met her cousin, by accident, on the staircase or in one of the passages, that lady would frown and shake her head, and sigh ; or would say as she passed \u2014 * Unfortunate child !\" or \"wicked child ! you see the consequences of your conduct.\" And then, when the poor girl ventured to hope that dear grandpapa was a little better, the lady would shake her head again, and put it to her conscience how she could possibly expect her poor old re lative to be better or otherwise than very bad indeed, when those to whom he had"], [166, "158 VALETTA. naturally so good a right to look for sup port and affection were discovered betray ing his confidence, and treating him with such black ingratitude. The result of all this was that the poor child sat hour after hour, her tears drop ping fast, and watering those sterile French verbs which lay spread out before her. Even the absent sister now became a secondary object of anxiety, so earnestly, so fervently did she long to penetrate with in the forbidden precincts of that sick room, to throw herself at dear, dear grandpapa's feet, to obtain his forgiveness for her offences, to be again taken into his favour and be allowed the ineffable happiness of watching by his sick bed \u2014 of smoothing down his sick pillow, and of praying by his side. Praying ! Ah ! that consolation at least was left her, and how often in the day when she was left alone by Peggy, would she slip down upon her knees, and hiding her"], [167, "VALETTA. 159 little head in her hands upon the table, would pray that she and her sister might be forgiven \u2014 that dear grandpapa would get better directly, and that her dear cousin would love her. The fact is, she was overwhelmed by a sense of her wickedness, and would not have been in the slightest degree surprised if any one had called at the house to take her off in wax-work as a notorious crimi nal. In the midst of this general trouble, re course might possibly have been had to Mr. Stiltmarche in person, who had soon been discovered to be a good-natured, easy sort of man, at whose approach not even the dog would put itself out of the way, and who might have exerted himself to ob tain for them an occasional entry into the sick room ; but this gentleman finding, after the first day, that the place was intol lerably dull, fell into the habit of taking himself off to Bmchurch early in the"], [168, "160 VALETTA. morning, and of not returning until late at night, so that Rhoda, who would have been the person to undertake the delicate nego tiation, had no opportunity of seeing him. Thus then passed several days, and it be came evident to all that a crisis was ap proaching. Jacob, instigated by Peggy, ventured to suggest that a doctor should be called in. He was, in consequence, briefly informed by Mrs. Vowlett, to whom this hint was given that the Squire had declared that there was only one doctor whom he would consent to see, and that he would await his return. At the same time, she requested Jacob to moderate his zeal, reminding him that his connection with the house would cease in a few weeks, and that the Squire was now in the hands of those who were his near relatives, and who had, conse quently, a right to interest themselves in his welfare."], [169, "VALETTA. 161 All then that could be done was to speculate and prophesy among themselves, and to watch and pray for the return of Scammony, the doctor, from his ill-timed visit to foreign parts."], [170, "162 VALETTA.

I have something to say. Hum ! Peggy, I should not wish what I am going to say to be mentioned again, you may take my word for it \u2014 I have been thinking this matter over in my mind, and you may rest assured of this, there is something at the bottom of it all.\" When the mountain of Jacob's sagacity"], [172, "164 VALETTA. had, with due solemnity, been delivered of this mouse of a conclusion he paused and fixed his eyes on Peggy to ascertain the effect which his revelation might have made on her feeble intellect.

If his look was attentive before, it now became positively intense, aud naturally enough too. As he examined this unfortunate person, he discovered at once that her hair had broken out into more than its usual disor der \u2014 that her eyes were positively flashing, and her cheeks glowing brilliantly \u2014 in a word that she was altogether changed. Peggy seemed to grow impatient under this deliberate survey, and to become de sirous of precipitating matters to a crisis. She again raised her hand and again"], [173, "165 VALETTA. snapped her fingers in his face. This time with a sonorous crack which made him draw back a step. \" And this,\" thought he, \" is the woman I was almost thinking to educate into a wife. Oh, woman, woman !

The long expected and long delaying Scammony had, at length, returned, and had favoured Norley Court with that presence which was, in the opinion of those who knew the state of affairs, necessary and sufficient to put things in order. He told Jacob that he had just arrived, and that hearing of the illness of the old gentleman, he had come over at once to see what was to be done, early as it was in the morning, and expressed himself gene rally to the effect that he was ready to put things in their places again, or to know the reason why.

Arrived there, he gently turned the handle. The door was locked. He listened. At first all seemed silent; but presently his ear caught a low, prolonged, mysterious sound. He held his breath to listen, for he was becoming alarmed. At this moment there was a gentle whispering within, and then the handle of the door turned \u2014 the door itself partly opened, and he found the cold, hard eye of Mrs. Stiltmarche fixed upon his. Notwithstanding the honestest intentions in the world, there is something in the very appearance of eavesdropping which creates I 3"], [180, "172 VALETTA. a momentary confusion \u2014 an effect from which even the self-relying Scammony could not entirely withdraw himself. It was one of those occasions on which everything depends on the first moment. The Doctor hesitated, and lost his chance. During that single moment, the lady stepped out of the room. The door was closed after her from within, and the key securely turned in the lock. \" Have the goodness to follow me, sir,\" said the lady. She led the way to the parlour, where, having shut the door, she seated herself, and pointed to a chair. \" I conclude, sir, that your reason for entering this house, unsummoned, unan nounced, and at such an hour, is, that you consider yourself as the medical attendant of its master.\" The lady paused \u2014 Scammony rubbed his hands together cheerfully, as if this way of commencing the conversation, was exceed ingly to his taste. In fact, just the sort of"], [181, "173 VALETTA. reception which a medical man might, under the circumstances, have most naturally expected. He accordingly bowed in assent. \" I am commissioned, sir, by Mr. Hardy man, my uncle, to inform you that be will have no further occasion for your highly valuable services, and to request that you will at you earliest convenience \u2014 \" The lady hesitated for a moment, seeking a form of words. \" Precisely,\" said the Doctor, with in creasing amiability of manner, stepping in to relieve her from her embarrassment. \" Send in my little account \u2014 Precisely \u2014 Certainly \u2014 Attend to it immediately, madam.

Indeed he expressed himself so perfectly satisfied with the result of the interview, and so sensible of the handsome way in which he had been treated, and as he did so, his manner was so de bonnne foi, and so serious withal, that after he had"], [183, "175 VALETTA. left the house, the lady almost half sus pected that he had been laughing in his sleeve all the time. That is the only defect in these magnifi cent airs and graces \u2014 if a person has so depraved a taste as not to take them seri ously they fall as flat as Burke's dagger, and pin down the toes of the would-be tragedian.

Then he lounged a little at the windows of a print shop from which his attention was drawn off by the still more agreeable picture of a bonnet and shawl on the opposite side of the street. The bonnet and shawl disappeared, and he got on very well until he came to a horse standing in a sporting farmer's cart, and opposite this he might have remained until even the indefatigable Doctor's patience had given way, had not a fine spaniel again carried him on, so that at length he found himself before the pump in the market place, which being the very omphalos and kernel of the town seemed suddeidy to re mind him that he had some particular ob ject in coming there."], [187, "179 VALETTA. Addressing himself accordingly to one of that otiose band, which is always to be found in the neighbourhood of a pump, or a public-house, he was directed down a long street which lay before him. \" I knew it !\" said Scammony, the mo- ment the index finger was raised, \" I knew well enough where he was going \u2014 the law yer's\u2014That will do for the present.\" Half an hour afterwards the Doctor hap pening (of course, by the merest chance in the world) to be turning a corner, came suddenly full iu contact with the honour able wanderer, and was naturally delighted and surprised to see him. The Doctor was aware, indeed, that Mr. Hardyman's niece was at Norley Court \u2014 in fact he had had the honour of an interview with her that morning ; but as she had not mentioned her husband's name, he con cluded that he was still at Brussels. \" Oh ! you've been at Norley this morning,\" said Mr. Stiltmarche. \" Why"], [188, "180 VALETTA. the deuce did not they tell me. I would have walked back with you to Benchurch.\" \" Do you intend to honour us with a long stay, sir?\" said the Doctor, deferentially. \" Why, to tell you the truth, Scammony, the sooner we can get off, the better I shall be pleased. The fact is I am ennuye a mort \u2014 bored to death.\" \" It must be dull \u2014that is for you who are accustomed to such a very different life. But for us\u2014\" Here the Doctor shrugged his shoulders, and gave a little deprecatory smile, which said as plainly as smile and shrug could say, (and that is much more plainly than the very best chosen words.) \" But for us poor devils it is well enough. Of course there must be some one to inhabit the country \u2014 to pay rents,and keep up the price of land, and rear vegetables, and that sort of thing for the London markets.

What the Doctor may have thought is quite another thing. \" Are you walking home, sir,\" said he \" Well. I suppose so. I suppose there is nothing to be done here.\" \"Absolutely nothing \u2014 Nothing that you could possibly do. Nothing to see. This is the market place \u2014 That is the pump erected by voluntary subscriptions, to assist in overcoming a deficient supply of water. Those are all the public monuments of the place.\""], [190, "182 VALETTA. \" And here is my house,\" said he, as he paused before his own door. \" Ah ! indeed !\" said the visitor, in a tone as though he would have said that he thought it highly creditable to a man in the Doctor's position to have such a snug little box. \" If you would condescend to come in \u2014 \" said the Doctor, with a mixture of good fellowship and respect, as he held open the door. Mr. Stiltmarche hesitated for a moment; but, the thought of the weary dreary hours at Norley overcame him. \"Why should not I?\" thought he. \"I shall never see the fellow again. It leads to nothing.\" Scammony intended that it should lead to a good deal."], [191, "183 VALETTA. CHAPTER IX. Leaving, for the present, the Honourable John Stiltmarche in the hands of the hos pitable Doctor at Benchurch, we return to the contemplation of his wife's conduct \u2014 that amiable lady, who has so readily un dertaken to put things on their proper footing in her sick uncle's house.

As long as their doings are unim peachable we reserve to ourselves the pri vilege of challenging their motives, thus securing to ourselves the desideratum of always having something to find fault with. \" At any rate, we will take the oppor tunity of observing thus much, that the lady was not especially possessed by an evil spirit ; but that she was merely that combination of good and bad qualities \u2014 of aberration from sound principles- \u2014 of weakness and strength : somewhere between whose boundaries must be sought the defi nitions of virtue and vice ; or, at any rate, the measure by which we must guage the so called good and bad people whose acquaintance we make in the world. Possibly, she may not even have been an unprincipled woman. \u2014 Possibly, even no one is unprincipled, that is to say, if by the term unprincipled is meant the habitually acting in defiance of those rules of right"], [193, "185 VALETTA. which we all admit to be binding on good folks. And at this point we suddenly find ourselves in presence of an alarming digres sion, which we by no means recommend our general reader to undertake ; for we find ourselves in the presence of one of the greatest of all those mischievous errors which we came into the world to fight against \u2014 an error which, perhaps, may have tripped up as many souls as any other \u2014 the Fallacy of Naughtiness. We all admit that there is such a thing as wickedness, and we all very cheerfully admit that there are such persons as wicked persons \u2014 indeed, there is no social duty which we more willingly fulfil, than that of sitting on the jury which condemns, unheard, our neighbours, in such forms of verdict as the following : \" He is a thoroughly bad man,\" \u2014 \" She is a completely heartless wo man,\" and so on through the various for mula's of social good fellowship."], [194, "186 VALETTA. And what is more \u2014 we really believe what we say \u2014 Conscientiously believe it. We believe in vice and wickedness with our whole hearts and souls ; \u2014 we read of it in the newspapers ; \u2014 we have distressing cases of it whispered in our ears and re ply \" that is shocking\" \u2014 and think so too ; \u2014 we hear of it at church, in connexion with weeping and gnashing of teeth, outer darkness, and other appalling images ; \u2014 we peep at it through prison bars occasionally, when we can do so on the sly, for we are half ashamed to be known to have been in its presence ; but, observe, all this time it is something quite apart from ourselves, \u2014 something with which we have nothing whatever to do, unless it be to scorn and denounce it, and, under certain conditions, cut it dead in St. James's Street \u2014 or to pity it and pray for, and preach against it, and reform it, if such be our still more danger ous condition of mind. But whether we are fierce or gentle in our condemnation, on this point we are all"], [195, "187 VALETTA agreed that as far as we are personally concerned, we will not tolerate it at all. \u2014 We feel it a duty to ourselves and to our children to shun it utterly, for, alas ! say we, it is vice which makes a desert of this fair world : \u2014 (that I believe is the figure,) and so we get quite away from it. \u2014 We place it in social lazar houses. \u2014 We draw around ourselves a cordon sanitaire strictly guarded by the bienseanees, and by the virtues ofthe stuffed hassock school. \u2014 At last we triumph ! \u2014 Heaven be praised ! After our infinite pains we can lay our hands upon our hearts and say that we have divided ourselves from it\u2014 that we are separated \u2014 or to use another word, which in the old Hebrew has the same meaning \u2014 that we are Pharisees. And so we are Pharisees \u2014 most un doubtedly Pharisees \u2014 so long as we twist this error around our souls. And now, where are we to find this"], [196, "188 VALETTA. wicked man \u2014 this vicious man whom we so constantly denounce V Really, no where. \u2014 There is no such person. \u2014 There never has been. \u2014 The whole world is made up of exactly such people as you and I, gentle reader, or sim ple reader, and we really should have great difficulty in fairly proving, that is, to the satisfaction of any third person, \u2014 that there are many people much better or much worse than ourselves. An honest gentleman once went to Court. \" Certainly,\" said he, \" it must be admitted that a Court suit is an ugly dress \u2014a very ugly dress.\" As our honest friend mounted the grand staircase, reflecting in this manner, he caught sight of a gentle man in the distance, \" There,\" said he to his companion, \" Now, if I had such a pair of sticks of legs as that goose of a fellow there, I would never come to Court again in my life.\" As the stranger approached, he found that it was himself in the glass. Many of us go about the world much in"], [197, "VALETTA. 189 the same manner as this good gentleman ; but with this difference, that we should not even know ourselves in a mirror, such strangers are we to ourselves.

To return to an atmosphere in which we breathe again more freely than amidst the fumes of the moral court house. In the course ofthe afternoon, the lawyer from Benchurch, to summon whom Mr. Stiltmarche, had been especially despatched, arrived at Norley Court. He was a staid, business-like man, followed by a still more staid and business-like clerk, who bore under his arm a vast blue bag. This trio, for the blue bag may fairly be considered as a distinct entity, as terrible as that little jar with the sealed lid, out of"], [199, "191 VALETTA. which Shahrazad'sfishermanallowed the ter ribly expansive demon to escape, \u2014 this trio was received by the lady who was expect ing their arrival, and who at once proceeded with them to the sick room of the poor old Squire. They remained there for a couple of hours, during the whole of which time the lady and the faithful Vowlctt were also in attendance. This was a very remarkable proceeding \u2014 at any rate, so remarkable and so omi nous did Jacob consider it, that he shook his head woefully, and, searching out Peggy, requested a confidential interview with her. This unwonted honour the unworthy Peggy however declined. Jacob shook his head still more gloomily, and declared that he saw how things were going. Peggy de clared that she doubted it. \" We are ruined, take my word for it. They're a cooking of a document there, over head, that will leave his honour, poor old gentleman, without a penny to bless"], [200, "192 VALETTA. himself with \u2014 not to say any thing of re warding long and faithful services.\" \"The Doctor will set all right,\" inter posed Peggy. \"The Doctor! That's the way with you women, always believing and swearing by some one, and that some one, almost always the wrong man.\" \" The Doctor, I tell you\" \u2014 began Peggy. \"The Doctor, be hanged,\" cried Jacob. \" He's as great a fool as you are.\" Peggy looked with a calm and deter mined gaze into the face of the unfortunate Jacob, and when she presently spoke there was nothing in her manner which evinced that the remarkable flower of rhetoric, of which she availed herself, was the result of a sudden gust of passion. She raised her head, snapped her fin gers in his face, and said, \" Fiddle-de-dee.\" \u2014 With this she departed. Terrible phrase! \u2014 Full of indifference, contempt, insubordination, and chaos come again !"], [201, "193 VALETTA. It left Jacob completely terrasse\", so much so, that it was as much as he could do to recover in time to make an attempt to pump the lawyer's clerk on his exit from the sick room, which resulted in his being again snubbed and again retiring in despair. The day advanced. The blue bag and the lawyers had taken their departure. Peggy was busy in her nursery. Jacob had locked himself up in one of his subter ranean retreats to shake his head at his leisure. And long and leisurely he shook it, and at length he summed up the result of his cogitations in these words : \" It is enough,\" said he, \" to make the dead walk again, and if they do \u2014 whew !\" And here a long whistle typified the idea for which words were found wanting. By and bye the evening wore on, and the hour arrived at which the little family was wont to retire for the night ; and yet there were no symptoms of the return of Mr. Stiltmarche, from Benchurch. The wife suddenly grew considerate. VOL. in. K"], [202, "194 VALETTA. \" You can go to bed, all of you,\" said she, \" I and my maid will sit up, \u2014 we are accustomed to it ; \u2014 besides we are watch ing the sick bed.\" And with such words as these she dis missed them all. By degrees a deep stillness took posses sion of the old house. It was at this time that the door of the sick room was cautiously opened. The lady came forth. \u2014 She paused and listened. \u2014 All was quiet, \u2014 as quiet as death. \u2014 She closed the door after her, and again the lock was heard to shoot from within. \u2014 It was a jealously guarded door. The lady heard the sound and was satis fied. She moved on, threading the pas sages with a stealthy step, \u2014 a cautious step she would have said ; \u2014 but still it was a stealthy step, and there was stealth writ ten in her countenance, as it showed by the lamp she bore in her hand. \u2014 It was a little watching lamp, whose feeble ray was not"], [203, "195 VALETTA. sufficient to overcome the moonlight, which shone brightly in through the windows. She descended the stairs, and pushing open the green door, began to traverse the hall. \u2014 It was the way for her to pass up to her own apartment, \u2014 the White Room. It was a perfect revel for the moonlight, in the old house, that night. It shone in, and threw itself in broad, bright patches on the bricked floor. It played upon the knobs and angles of the oak book-cases, casting upon the old books a brighter light than they themselves had probably ever thrown upon anything. Then it seemed determined to penetrate to the bottom of that mysterious old hearth, and threw in upon the rusty iron chenets a brighter light than certainly had glowed there for many a night. Then a beam more wanton than the rest would settle playfully upon the nose of some quaint por trait, or give quite a mysterious air to that poor dilapidated empty old beau of a stuffed peacock. k 3"], [204, "196 Valetta. Around these bright patches of light, however, there lurked dark and suspicious masses of shadow \u2014 so dark and so sus picious indeed, that the lady suddenly paused. She held her breath. All was silent through the house, save the faint creaking of some distant door resting uneasily on its hinge, and the loud, measured beat of the old hall clock. Still her eyes remained fixed on one particular spot, and all her faculties were concentrated iu that eager gaze. In the very centre of the darkness some object moved. What was it that made her pulse stand still \u2014 which armed itself with a thousand nameless horrors to overwhelm the heart which the remembrance of that day's deed had unnerved and left defenceless. Was it a thing of this world 1 Was it some phantom of another world whieh thus arrayed itself against her . Was it possi ble then that the old family secret, laughed"], [205, "197 VALETTA. at and hushed up, was after all, a truth \u2014 No! Was it not rather some trick of fancy \u2014 some momentary weakness of the brain overcome by long watchings, and the re cent terrible crisis \u2014 It must be fancy. There could be nothing in that corner where she so distinctly saw a shadowy figure. \" Who is there V said the lady, in a tolerably firm voice. Then came a little quiet footstep out of the darkness, and the figure was gone, and Rhoda, the little Rhoda was at her side. And yet it seemed as if there had been another tenant of that darkness \u2014 a single, solitary, silent figure, tall and death-like \u2014 in garments of strange fashion \u2014 strange fashion, \u2014 a fashion from beyond the grave. No ! it must have been a freak of the overwrought imagination, for now the space where the seeming figure had stood was vacant again, and not a sound had in dicated its departure."], [206, "198 VALETTA. The lady threw a keen glance at Rhoda. As the long streak of moonlight fell upon the child, it imparted such an unearthly calm to the fair face surrounded by its masses of light hair that she continued to gaze upon it for some moments with a feeling akin to superstitious fear. Indeed it was a strange meeting this between the two \u2014 the dark determined woman trembling at she knew not what, and the calm and pure child. They met there in that old hall where the great events of their family had been enacted for hundreds and hundreds of years. And now here they were in their turn, face to face, the leaders of the two opposite parties \u2014 on the one side the subtle brain of the bold and scheming woman \u2014 on the other the single heart and simple purpose of the child. \" Is that you, Rhoda,\" whispered the lady. \" Yes, dear cousin.\""], [207, "199 VALETTA. The answer \u2014 the very sound of the voice restored the lady to herself. \" Come here, child,\" said she. The child came to her, and turned up her gentle eyes inquiringly. There was something in that quiet gaze which at first disconcerted and then irri tated the lady. \" What do you stare at me so for V she said, stamping her foot on the floor. \"What have I done to be looked at in that way?\" The child made no answer, but gazed up more earnestly and wonderingly than be fore. \" What do you do here, child, at this time of night,\" cried she again, stamping her foot. \" Nothing, dear cousin.\" \" Nothing ! Then get to bed, you wicked child, and take that to make you remember not to watch me. Away, I de test a mean spy. Take that !\" As the lady spoke, she raised her hand,"], [208, "200 VALETTA, and upon that fair cheek fell for the first time \u2014 a blow. It was not repeated. The effect was sufficiently remarkable to startle the lady. The child's hands dropped mechanically to her sides\u2014 her eyes closed, and a deadly pallor overspread her countenance. Her very heart seemed to stand still, and then in the next moment the blood rushed back to her face, flushing it with a burning blush of indignation. She gave one look at her cousin \u2014 that was her only resentment. There is a sort of superiority in having suffered unjustly. The child went back to her room, and when she kneeled down by her bed-side, and raised up her earnest eyes to the bright spot where the moon, surrounded by its silver clouds, sailed on its course in heaven, the cloud had passed away from her heart, her soul shone forth again in its brightness, and in her prayers she did not forget her \" dear cousin's \" uame."], [209, "201 V-ALETTAv Those who seek a triumph over their enemies may well borrow a weapon from the quiver of this loving child ; remem bering that when once resentmeut is fairly aroused the enemy to overcome is then yourself. A 5"], [210, "202 VALETTA CHAPTER XI After the child had departed, the lady cast a rapid and nervous look around her ; for she could still hardly divest herself of the idea, that she had seen just now a second figure \u2014 a something dim and mysterious resting among the deepest shadows of the room. There were strange tales told about that old hall, and it was with an uneasy sensa tion that she hurried through it, listening as she went to .the loud echoes of her foot steps."], [211, "VALETTA. 203 She passed quickly through the alcove and up the broad old staircase which led up to her apartment. The moon shone in brightly through a latticed window half way up the stairs. She glanced suspiciously at the old portraits on the wall \u2014 at that dark, old cabinet on the top of the stairs, and at the faint shadowy picture above it. Before her, surrounded by the sombre panelling, was the white door of her own room. There were some people in that little parish of Norley \u2014 people well to do and esteemed sensible \u2014 whom nothing would have tempted to turn the old-fashioned handle of that door on which the moon cast so sickly a light, and to have entered that room. Nevertheless, the lady did it \u2014 she entered the room, set clown her lamp on a table, and then returning to the door, locked it on the inside, and, as the key grated in the rusty wards, she listened to it as to a wel-"], [212, "204 VALETTA come voice which told her that she was alone, and that she had excluded the world. Alas ! it is not so easy to shut out that busy world within \u2014 that world which so interferes with all our plans for repose \u2014 which in the solitude of our chambers, in the still night when we have promised our selves that we will rest sweetly and forget, comes down upon us, snatches the pillow from under our heads, and says \u2014 \" Now \u2014 up and be doing \u2014 lament the past \u2014 scheme for the future \u2014 weep for the lost one \u2014 dread for the absent one\u2014 sin in thought, or suffer in thought \u2014 To forget is not for such as you.\" The lady after she had locked the door still found that she was not alone, for she had not succeeded in shutting out her own thoughts. She turned to the window. The scene which presented itself there was not one exactly calculated to dissipate anxious pon derings. The church-yard lay below."], [213, "205 VALETTA. Some thirty paces from the window ex tended the long dark side of the church, reposing in the deepest shade. The details of its buttresses and mouldings could not be made out by the eye \u2014 all lay mingled together in one undefined mass. As the lady gazed, the moon passed out from behind a cloud, which had for a moment obscured it, and then, in the dark side of the church, the spaces of the windows became instantly defined, and a bright and steady light played through them. It was the moonlight ; but so strong was the light within, that the lady could well have believed it some sudden secret rite, and almost listened for the sound of voices. Then, as she gazed and listened, the lights moved before her eyes, and a sound like a death chaunt came faintly and mourn fully upon her ear. Surely this was something more than another freak of that dark old ilex, whose eaves moved by some gentle night wind"], [214, "206 VALETTA. were waving slowly to and fro, and glisten ing in the clear cold moonlight. Ah ! who can tell ? Below her lay the graves with that code of morality \u2014 that inevitable law written on their white stones gleaming ghastly in the pale light \u2014 and that single, solitary mother's grave. There was something in the pleading voice of the night scene which did not harmonize with the strong vitality of the worldly woman. She drew the curtain closely, and, with a sort of half shudder, turned into the room. She was not quite at ease \u2014 It was an uneasy hour \u2014 an uneasy spot \u2014 Uneasy! If one tenth part of the tales which were told of that room, in which she now stood, were true, it was a horrible spot. She had heard all those tales \u2014 once she had put faith in them, and though the weak credu lity of her childhood had given way to the still weaker incredulity of her matured years, yet there are certain times and places in which we do not care to be left"], [215, "207 VALETTA alone to combat our sears with the weapons of our unbelief. The lady glanced round the room which family tradition had for some unassigned reason connected with the mysterious visitant to Norley, and the neighbourhood of which to that sad spot where so many of the Hardymans lay for ever quelled, may have given rise to the tradition. For that it was but a tradition \u2014 a vague and empty, and childish tradition \u2014 the lady as she gazed furtively round the room made a point of several times declaring to her self. The apartment was, not without reason, denominated the White Room. In its general form, and the character of its fur niture, it closely resembled that occupied by the Squire, and which has been already described. Like that, it was a large, old fashioned room, with old-fashioned furni ture. The wainscot, however, had been painted of a dead white, so had the great beam which traversed the ceiling. The"], [216, "208 VALETTA. hangings of the huge, old bed in the centre of the room were white, and so were the curtains, so were the arm-chairs \u2014 the very carpet, which strained itself over the centre ofthe room, was of a light, stone grey. In relief, and strong contrast to all this, was the margin of the black, oak floor, which, round the sides of the room, ap peared from beneath the carpet \u2014 the dark, ebony cabinets and drawers, which stood against the side of the wall, and, above all, a single picture, which hung over the deep carved mantel of the fire-place. It was a portrait of one of the ladies of Norley, and as the lady looked at it. she felt, that after all that had been said about that room, it ought never to have been al lowed to remain there. The back-ground of the picture was dark, and the figure, which was draped in white, stood out in strong relief, and almost seemed, by the uncertain ha's light of the lamp, to detach itself from the canvass, and to step forth into the room."], [217, "209 VALETTA. So, at least, thought the lady, who, as she sat thrown back in her arm-chair, be fore the empty hearth, with her dark dress and dark face contrasted and brought out into relief by the white covering of the chair, seemed herself to be almost a corres ponding picture, so silently and stilly did she sit, as, with her cheek resting on her hand, she gazed intently at the picture. It was the old type, that picture. The same slight, graceful form \u2014 the same pale, delicate face \u2014 and the same dark, bashful eye, which had been reproduced in Valet ta's mother, and in Valetta herself. The lady who sat there knew it \u2014 and the knowledge coloured her thoughts. And as she gazed on that face of the pic ture, her brow darkened. None ofthe painters ever made a mistake inconveyingthe expression of the faces of the females of the Hardyman family to can vass. There was always that same look of timid, mournful resignation, so easy to be read by all who looked on them."], [218, "210 VALETTA. They served hard masters, did those poor women \u2014 whether they were born in the house, or brought into it by marriage \u2014 a race of iron lords, who broke down their woman's will, and woman's hearts, and com pressed them within the Procrustean limits of their own sovereign pleasure. Now and then there came a spirit which could not yield \u2014 a bird which could not endure the iron bondage. Such a thing had occurred once or twice, and then there would be a whisper of bad blood \u2014 desper ate domestic strife \u2014 then came a rumour of failing health, and mental alienation \u2014 the wife appeared to no man, and, at last, it was heard that the untameable bird had died \u2014 had killed itself in its endeavours to burst through the bars of its cage. At length the lady roused herself from her reverie. Her heart was on the male side of the Hardymans. \u2014 She took a little gold key from a chain which hung at her neck, and she opened with it the green"], [219, "211 VALETTA. leather travelling case which lay on the table. For a moment she looked round her, and listened. She was alone, secure in the absence of the world \u2014 that perfect solitude of the worldly. She touched a spring in the desk, and a little secret drawer flew forth. From it she drew a letter. Heaven help the husband of this secre tive dame ! He reposed securely under the triumphal arch of marital security ; but its key-stone, his wife's heart, was withdrawn. The woman's heart. \u2014 What a possession !

The dragon took things easily, and the golden apples were stolen. You have snapped the steel. \u2014 It can't be repaired. \u2014 The heart is gone. The lady opened the letter. It was that last little note which she had received from the \"false, fleeting, perjured"], [221, "VALETTA. 213 Clarence,\" and which we have already caught her in the act of persuing, at Brussels. She bent over it, read it over again and again, gathering meaning and significance from its very no meaning ; and as she read, her looks darkened, and her hand closed upon the letter. For a moment she held it crumpled up in the flame of the lamp, and then, tossing it into the empty grate, she watched the little creeping blue flame which eat its way into it, until it was consumed. When she saw it lying a little black mass of wavering tinder, she folded her arms together. A woman hangs her faith on little things. The tiny instrument, by which she had signed her soul to bondage, was cancelled, and she stood there freed from her fancies, and alone. Alas ! for a woman \u2014 alone in the world. For a moment she bent her head. It is"], [222, "214 VALETTA. an awful thing, the unloving solitude of a woman's heart. Presently she raised it proudly again, \u2014 for the devil of her nature finding the house swept and garnished, and empty, had entered in, \u2014 it possessed her soul, and gleamed forth from her flashing eye. \" Voila la fin,\" said she aloud. \u2014 \" Voila la tin, \u2014 Clarence, \u2014 no more, Clarence. You are ruined. You are beggars, you and your brat, wife ; and I, \u2014 I have done it, \u2014 this very day I have done it. \u2014 I have planned and achieved your ruin, \u2014 no matter at what cost, and at what risk. \u2014 Were it to do fifty times over I w ould do it, and glory in it ; \u2014 yes, you are beggars, and I shall have what would have been \u2014 and should have been \u2014 yours.\" She paused for a moment, and then a faint, scornful smile turned the corner of her lips, as she added : \" And you shall both be my pensioners, and come and beg to me for bread, \u2014 yes, for your very bread, from day to day. \u2014"], [223, "215 VALETTA.

WThat weakness ! what folly ! she was alone. Yes, by degrees her eyes ventured into every corner of the room. She was alone. Her last effort \u2014 the greatest, was to raise her eyes to the picture. No, there it was \u2014 nothing but a picture after all \u2014 the eyes still turned upon the single white rose which the effigy bore in its hand. It was but a picture, and a bad one at best, and had she gazed at it as persistently as the Jesuit neophite gazed at Father Gar net's straw she could have made no more of it. It was fancy, then ; a freak of the over wrought nerves, this, supposed sound. So she insisted as she forced herself to resume her seat. But it would not do ; she tried in vain to divert her mind.

To pass the night alone in that chamber she felt to be impossible, so taking the lamp in her hand she re-threaded the silent passages, and again sought shelter within that now welcome door of the poor old Squire's room.

We left him in the act of condescending to enter beneath the humble roof of Mr. Scammony at Benchurch ; and we return to him again at that point, making at the same time our best apologies, for having ventured in the meantime to direct our attention elsewhere. The Doctor then, ushered his visitor into"], [227, "219 VALETTA. a library, a good room filled with excellent books. In the snuggest recess by the fire there was an easy chair, and a little table, on which were some books, selected for more immediate use, and whose titles showed that the master possessed the quality which, like that of chosing a horse and a friend, is a gift of nature in the first in stance, and then improved and matured by experience \u2014 the quality of chosing that best of friends, a good book. The visitor glanced at the titles of the books, and sank into a chair. \" Upon my honour,\" thought he, \" this fellow knows how to choose an arm chair. Why, Scammony, you have quite a little set of books here.\" \" Oh ! no,\" replied the Doctor, \" a few. A person in my position confined to the country, can't have many books ; it's out of the question.

This again was the snuggest little room in the world, around whose walls bung a few trifling little pictures, the equals of which could not have been produced from the visitor's ancestral halls. They were good pictures, and the Doctor knew it, which is not always the case with the possessors of good pictures. Some he had admired all his life, and had had left to him in wills, or he had bought them at sales as the families broke up. There was one for which he had given five hundred guineas, which the visitor thought within himself an infernal piece of presumption, and wondered what things would come to next. He was, however, appeased by the ap pearance of a charming little luncheon which had been devised for the Doctor's own private consumption. There were one"], [229, "VALETTA. 221 or two pdtSs which quite surprised him, and some Madeira which he pronounced really a deuced good glass of wine. Of all the devils which possess humanity there is none more difficult to exorcise than family pride.

The Doctor, however, knew what he was about. As a medical man, he had a strong pro fessional faith in those few poor feet of in testine which overcame Alexander and Napoleon, and whose peristaltic motion"], [230, "222 VALETTA. keeps the world jogging on, and as he made it a rule to address himself to that mighty organ, the stomach, his \" e\u00e6orciso te \" was a mighty spell. Accordingly, after lunch, the proud stomach of the visitor was so far assuaged that he allowed himself to be conducted by his host into a httle room sacred, or de secrated to tobacco. It was one of those little retreats shut off from the stern realities of the outer world by double, self-closing doors \u2014 silent, listed doors which whisper to you as they close with a whirr, \" Voi che intrate lasciate ogni speranza ;\" \u2014 which whisper \u2014 Put off your tight fitting, worldly coat \u2014 your hopes and fears for one half hour \u2014 unstrap your load \u2014 set down your pack \u2014 ease your poor galled shoulders \u2014 fix your eyes upon the little"], [231, "223 VALETTA. empty cloud which curls out from your lips, and lose sight of your more solemn follies and your more substantial inanities. It was a charming little retreat, was this smoking-room of this self-indulgent doctor \u2014 a room in which every chair was pitched at forty-five \u2014 the true angle of indolence. The visitor expressed himself well pi eased. \" Why really, Scammony,\" said he, \" upon my word you have a deuced snug little place here.\" And so saying, he threw himself into a chair. From a drawer were produced cigars of all sorts, sizes, ages and qualities\u2014 on a little table at his side were periodicals and daily papers \u2014 that morning bath of printers' ink, in which the world washes off yesterday, and invigorates itself for the coming day.

When the doctor had got his poor visitor into this skilfully baited trap, he requested permission to leave him for a quarter of an hour to attend to some affairs in the town. So interesting were the chairs, cigars, and journals, that the honourable gentle man was graciously pleased to express his acquiescence in this request. The doctor accordingly sallied forth. He had hardly issued from his own door, and indulged in his habitual relaxation of tantalizing the curiosity of the old lady opposite, by assuming an air of great mystery, when at the bottom of the street he caught sight of a brilliant apparition of flashing chatelaine and glistening chamelion"], [236, "228 VALETTA. silks, and no sooner did he see this than with an expression of satisfaction he hur ried on to brave the dangers of Miss Merryton \u2014 for no other than the Merryton was it \u2014 that gorgeous, brilliant creature of the year before, unchanged in any respect except in that single one \u2014 her ever chang ing attire. \" Ah ! you wicked creature,\" cried the lady, \"where have you been \u2014 eloping or something dreadful, you bad, abandoned man.\" And as she spoke, on flashed the eyes, and the ringlets and the el d'Alala parasol with more dazzling effect than ever \u2014 naturally \u2014 she had had a year's more practice. \" Could I elope while Miss Merryton remained at Benchurch,\" cried the doctor, placing his hand on his heart, with that tone of privileged serio-comic gallantry assumed by the bachelor uncles in a five act play."], [237, "229 VALETTA. \" Ah !\" said the lady, tapping his knuckles with the parasol, \"fie done ! I am sure I don't know, why we poor girls are so weak as to listen to you gentlemen \u2014 you flatter and persuade, and then when you have made us believe you \u2014 when you have made us \u2014 heigho !\" And here the young lady paused, drooped the parasol so as to shut out the Doctor from the sight of that heaven \u2014 her face, and presently sighed \" heigho,\" again. This was a good opening for the Doctor and fairly challenged him to speak out like a man, and a bachelor, and to give proof of his sincerity. He did not, however, attempt to avail himself of it \u2014 the wretch \u2014 but laughed, and changed the subject. \" Well,\" said the Doctor, after he had sustained the conversation, the taps with the el d' Alala, and the glances for a few more minutes. \" I must tear myself away. Adieu fair lady.\""], [238, "230 VALETTA. \" Adieu.\" \" By-the-bye, you should go and enquire after our old friend at Norley Court. He is very ill \u2014 besides, there are some very charming people staying in the house \u2014 quite elegants? \" Stop,\" said the lady, \" who are \u2014 \" \"Can't stop, really,\" cried the Doctor, dexterously twitching himself away. \"A thousand things to do.

Before the Doctor had proceeded a hundred yards, he tumbled against a rusty suit of black, in which lay enshrined all that was mortal of the immortal Doctor Bolfey, the great antiquarian and historio grapher of Benchurch This great individual was wrapped in the seediest of cloaks, and profound thought. He stood in the middle of the street, a magnifying glass in one hand, and a bit of tile in the other. \"Congratulate me,\" said the antiqua rian, as soon as he recovered from the slap on the back, by means of which the irreverent son of medicine had withdrawn him from his reverie."], [240, "232 VALETTA. \" What on 1 Have you found the philo sopher's stone ?\" \" I am fortunate to-day,\" said the other, with the quiet depreciating air, which a man would inevitably assume, who had just picked the Pitt diamond out of the kennel. He handed the glass and precious relic to the Doctor. \" Examine it\u2014 It is Roman.\" \" Koman ! bah ! Roman cement !\" \" If you will have the goodness to look at \u2014 \" began the antiquarian. \" Well \u2014 there \u2014 there \u2014 well. Don't prove it. That's all,\" cried Scammony. \" I admit it is Roman. You are a lucky fellow. Come and celebrate your good fortune with me. I want you to dine to day early \u2014 say six \u2014 to meet a man who takes a particular interest in antiquities, and bring Pratt with you.

The Honourable John Stiltmarche did not like to be alone \u2014 he dreaded the solitude of Norley Court, especially since the close attendance of his wife in the sick room, had deprived him of that modified solitude \u2014 her society. Therefore, when the Doctor returned to him in 7 smoking-room, and presented to him a somewhat promising bill of fare, and a very humble request that he would honour him by staying to test its accuracy, he consented with much affability, and six o'clock saw him seated in company with the two other guests, Bolfey and Pratt, in the little dining-room of the Doctor. Nor did he repent his condescension. The dinner and wines were really so ex cellent, that society became a matter of minor consideration."], [242, "234 VALETTA. Even on this point, however, he had no fault to find. The Doctor, though blandly independent in the form of his speech, seemed in its substance to be every instant saying, \" You will pardon all this, and graciously remem ber that it is but the country.\" He told several excellent stories, did the Doctor, and when his honourable guest laughed, and made his comment, it really almost appeared as if he himself had supplied the point and piquancy of the jokes. Then poor Pratt, too, a sort of jobbing medical subordinate of the Doctor's, and who was somewhat uneasy to find himself with only his second best coat on in such exalted society, was deeply reverential. Even this was pleasing. It was but a poor, scurvy, Caliban sort of worship after all ; but we most of us like to play the Stephano occasionally, and to indulge our vanity"], [243, "235 VALETTA. with a secret orgie in the society of our inferiors. There are moments when even tolerably sensible men may feel a sort of rank plea sure in being mistaken for the man in the moon and hearing such questions as those, of the most weak and moon-struck monster, \" Hast thou not dropped from heaven V \u2014 \" How does your honour V \u2014 \" Let me lick your shoe.\" Bolfey, too, played his part satisfactorily. For it turned out that he knew more about the history of the honourable gentleman's family, a century or two back, than the honourable gentleman himself knew about the affairs of his own uncles and cousins. Thus then things went on flourishingly, and the minnows played about and tickled his toes, until he believed himself the greatest of Tritons, and blew his conch of self-praise accordingly. After dinner the party adjourned to their coffee, in the smoking-room, which, by the"], [244, "236 VALETTA. light of a lamp and a merrily blazing fire, looked a more delightful retreat than ever. They smoked and sipped away, and at last some one proposed a rubber. Then came the cards. First, Scammony played with the anti quarian, and lost ; and then he played with his honourable guest and won. The evening stole away. The night became darker and more dreary. The fire burned more cheerily. The play became more interesting. The honourable John thought he had never played better, or with better luck. The Cabanas, and Ren currells, and Regalias, became better flavoured, and finally, virtuous resolution was laid by the heels and swamped in a bowd of punch, which would have satisfied even a German Crambambulist. Nor was that all which was swamped in the said punch. The learned antiquarian's brains became"], [245, "237 VALETTA. at length so drenched therein, that at a comparatively early hour he became trou blesomely learned, and then incoherent, and was obliged to retire from the field. He was attended to the door by his host, who had kindly undertaken to blacken his nose with a burnt cork, and to abstract the inestimable Roman relic from his pocket. The night passed. Late on the following morning, Mr. Stilt marche awoke in a snug bed of the doctor's, with a slight head ache, and a faint but terrible recollection of having drunk Pratt 's health with the Kentish fire, and of having insisted on proposing him at the best club in London. He also endeavoured to recall the ingre dients of that splendid bowl of Crambam buli, the recipe of which he had a sort of vague fancy that he himself had given to the doctor. \u2014 He could distinctly remember the doctor having complimented him on it."], [246, "238 VALETTA. In vain, \u2014 he could not bring to mind the component parts of that glorious bowl, from the bottom of which the doctor's ser vants were at that very moment fishing out the antiquarian's Roman tile."], [247, "VALETTA 239 CHAPTER XII. On the morning after the dinner, while Mr. Stiltmarche's head was still upon his pillow, the doctor, by one of those acci dents which were perpetually favouring him, chanced to meet the lawyer, who had, on the previous day, been sent over to Nor ley Court. \" Well,\" said the doctor, jovially, \"this fine weather wont do for us.\" \" Perhaps not, fpr you? said the other, rubbing his hands together comfortably."], [248, "240 VALETTA. \" Nor for you. \u2014It braces people up. \u2014 They feel that they are going to live for ever. \u2014 Who would make a will now, I ask you, on such a day as this V \" Humph,\" said the other, \" You think not V \" I am sure not.\" \" Scammony,\" said the lawyer, suddenly changing his tone, \u2014 a truce to joking, \" What do you think of affairs at Norley Court ?\" \" Well, candidly then, I think very badly of them.\" \" Not worse than I do. \u2014 What do you think of the condition ofthe old man V \u2022' Confidentially V \" The strictest confidence.

It may have been about two o'clock, on the same afternoon, that Madame Stilt marche, on her watch in the sick room at Norley Court, was suddenly startled by the sound of several strange voices in loud conversation below. Issuing cautiously forth, the lady de scended the stairs, to ascertain the cause of the commotion. On the third or fourth step from the bottom, she descried an object, which, at first, in the distance, presented the appear ance of a large bundle of patchwork, or the contents of an Israelitish fancy-dress bag shot out at random. This object, on a closer scrutiny, turned out to be Lady Marrwell, who. upon her knees and hands,"], [251, "243 VALETTA. was intently gazing down on the ground. So intently, indeed, that she paid no atten tion to Madame Stiltmarche, and did not even appear to be aware of her ap proach. \" What are you doing here V said the latter, touching the prostrate lady with her foot \" My good woman,\" murmured she, thus invoked, without raising her eyes, \" if you happen to have a few minutes to spare, I shall be obliged to you to help me look for a\u2014\" \" Who are you,\" repeated the lady, stamping her foot impatiently. \" A lapis lazuli bracelet of great value.\" \" Tush !\" exclaimed the lady, passing on. \" Est elle folk cette femme la?\" At the bottom of the stairs, she met one, who, had he felt disposed, might have given her an authoritative answer to her question.

He had invested himself in a new and lustrous suit of black, his boots creaked merrily, as if they were telling each other how they longed to be skipping up-stairs, his watch-chain dangled playfully in the air, twisting itself, and rattling and shining brightly at his slightest motion. A sense of triumph pervaded the whole man, concealing itself in his demurely twisted mouth, and his half closed, merry eye, and half suggesting itself in the httle bow, and gentle rubbing together of the hands, with which he acknowledged the presence of the lady. Difficult as it is to conceal our self-satis faction from the indifferent, it becomes doubly so to conceal it from those at whose expense it originates.

He smiled as benignly as those who have the best of it can afford to do, and rubbed his hands gently together, as much as to say that he felt perfectly well and happy, and that it greatly increased his animal spirits on that fine seasonable morn ing to find himself in the presence of so distinguished, and at the same time so agreeable a personage as the lady before him."], [254, "246 VALETTA. Every word of all this did the Doctor's manner express, and as the lady's cold glance settled on him he seemed to be re peating it over and over again, until her eyes began to flash, and she was so stung out of her reserve as to demand abruptly how the Doctor came to be there. The manner of his coming was simple enough, as simple as a brougham and a couple of tearing little rat-like horses could render it. This he stated \u2014 but he did not state that the object of his coming was to break through the cabal which had imprisoned the old Squire, and to get sight and hear ing of him by any means \u2014 if necessary, by violent ones \u2014 the immediate necessity of which course he had gathered from his morning's interview with the lawyer.

On the road they overtook the little fairy car containing Lady Marrwell and the enchantress \u2014 a coincidence which Scam mony declared fortunate, and which he had taken care to secure by secret and zestful watchings at his own window. The carriages had driven on together, and arrived at the Court in company.

As much of all this as the Doctor thought it desirable to reveal, formed his answer to the lady's question of how he came to be there. \" I am to understand then, sir, that the honour of your presence here in spite of what took place at our last interview, is owing to an express invitation from my husband.\" \" Precisely.\" \" Can you inform me, sir, where I may find him, since it appears that you are such intimate friends,\" continued the lady, her eyes charged with the fires of domestic electricity. \"Certainly, madam,\" said the Doctor. \"Have the goodness to step this way.

The door which communicated between"], [257, "VALETTA. 249 the hall and the garden was open, and through it was visible a long, green, sunlit vista, at the bottom of which there pre sented itself to the lady a sight pleasing to no feminine eyes \u2014 a sight indeed of a highly incensing and transporting nature.

Your hearts are too strong, and your heads not strong enough. This is true of you generally \u2014 There are, of course, exceptions ; but they serve the purpose of all exceptions. Poor, dear Madame Stiltmarche ! The Doctor, that crafty man \u2014 'that \"\u2014Wily Adder blithe and glad\u2014\""], [259, "251 VALETTA. had not felt the wrists of your sex for a quarter of a century in vain \u2014 he could calculate the pulsation of your hearts to a fraction of a second, and had some little insight into the causes which would ac celerate or retard it. Toor lady ! When this disgusting levity on the part of her husband was thus brought under her notice, the indignation, natural enough to an outraged wife, took entire possession of her, and forgetting every thing \u2014 forgetting her coolness, her policy, her ripened plans \u2014 she, in an instant of passion, put her foot through the delicate web of chicane which she had been so successfully weaving. Forgetting that her husband and his doings were matters of profound and de clared indifference to her, she rushed forth into the garden, and left the passage clear to her adversary. The Doctor was not the man to throw away any chance, much less this brilliant occasion."], [260, "252 VALETTA. Having watched his fair adversary as she flung away from him into the garden, and having for one short second rubbed his hands in pantomimic appreciation of this delicious little intrigue, he sprang up stairs, clearing the prostrate Lady Marrwell at a bound, and presently gently turned the handle of the poor old Squire's well known door. The Doctor then, with the soft footfall of his craft, entered the sick-room. The windows were darkened, and but a feeble ray of sun-light stole in upon that mystery of coming dissolution \u2014 that last hour of the long battle between the man and his Fate. All was silent. He gently drew the curtain of the bed. There lay the old man, his head back upon the pillow, his eyes closed with heavy lids, his face drawn down, his jaw fallen. The Doctor gently took up the patient's wrist \u2014 Its iron muscles were at last re-"], [261, "253 VALETTA. laxed, and it rested heavily and helplessly in the supporting hand. The Doctor took out his watch\u2014 Long he held it, and anxiously he counted the pulsations \u2014 the little clicking beat of this last arbiter of man's life alone breaking the silence. He passed his hand over the old man's head and breast. There still lingered there the last spark of life. It was a bad case \u2014 and though there was no witness to see him, the Doctor shook his head sadly ; but still there was a spark, and, therefore, a possibility that the flame might be re-kindled. He had been prepared, by his conversa tion with the Lawyer, for the style of case he would have to treat. He drew from his pocket a small bottle, and held it to the old man's nostrils. Presently a tear stood in the corner of the patient's eye. Out came another bottle, and another."], [262, "254 VALETTA. He moistened the temples, and the mouth. A few drops trickled over the parched tongue. Presently a slight shudder passed through the patient's frame, and there was a tremulous motion about his lips. Again the Doctor renewed his efforts \u2014 and presently the lips moved. The Doctor held down his ear to the old man's face, and caught these words, as he murmured them from between his clenched teeth \u2014 \" Help ! Wa-let-ta, gal.\" The Doctor blew his nose loudly \u2014 al most with a vindictive tweak \u2014 and went off to the window to let in a little sun light upon the scene. The noise woke a watcher \u2014 one who should have been a watcher \u2014 but whom long hours of anxious unrest had overcome, and who had sunk into a heavy sleep on the other side of the bed. It was the faithful Vowlett, who, thus disturbed, sprang up suddenly from the"], [263, "VALETTA. 255 arm-chair, which had betrayed her, and with flushed face and glistening, fevered eyes, and trembling, coward heart hardily confronted the Doctor. \" You can't come in,\" said she ; \" my orders are strict. I have had nothing to do with it. 1 obey my orders, and I tell you, you can't come in. It would be more than my situation is worth.\" \"My good woman,\" said the Doctor, quietly, \" do you know \u2014 -\" \"I know nothing \u2014 I tell you, I know nothing about it all ; but you must leave the room directly.\" \" Silence woman,\" said the Doctor, in a tone which, though quiet, was not to be disobeyed. \" Your situation is not what you suppose it \u2014 your situation is a very serious one.

The Doctor hurried, at once, to as certain what was happening. The old man's eyes were open, and they"], [265, "257 VALETTA. fell upon him with a half curious, half un conscious gaze. Again his lips moved \u2014 and again the Doctor stooped to catch the sounds wdiich might issue from them. Presently he dis tinguished these words \u2014 \" Kick \u2014 her \u2014 out. Kick \u2014 her \u2014 out. Where's \u2014 my \u2014 gal 1\" And then the old man closed his eyes again, and the tears slowly trickled from beneath their lids, and rolled down his cheeks. We leave the Doctor to continue his treatment, which we may be sure he will do with competent skill, and the heartiest zeal, and we follow the worthy Vowlett, who had taken the opportunity, when his attention was thus directed, to slink out of the room.

(That young lady was quite equal to hold her own in any tournay with these weapons against all comers.) We prefer joining the party, at the mo ment when the faithful Vowlett hurried out to inform her mistress, to the infinite relief of that mistress's honourable but erring lord, that she wished immediately to speak with her very particularly. It took but a few moments to relate the inroad of the fatal Doctor into the sick room \u2014 her vain endeavour to eject him again \u2014 his words \u2014 and the message with which he had charged her \u2014 and last, and worst of all, that he was already beginning to receive confidential communications from the old Squire.

As the lady stood apart, listening to this disastrous intelligence, she determined, within her desperate heart, that, in spite of all, she would still conquer. A terrible thought flashed across her \u2014 for a moment, she shuddered at it, and saw it in all its horror \u2014 and then, in the next moment, it came back again, and she dwelt upon it \u2014 and, from that moment, it appeared a feasible step \u2014 a necessary step \u2014 a hazardous step, but nothing more. In the meantime, the Merryton, finding that little more was to be done, suddenly remembered that her grandmama would be wondering what had become of her, and declared her intention of returning forthwith to Benchurch. In the meantime, also, Mr. Stiltmarche was suffering from those misgivings to which husbands are liable, when they"], [268, "260 VALETTA. imagine that they discover, in certain little contractions of the wife's brow and lips, the approach of the storm, which their own mis-feasances and non-feasances has provoked. He, doubtingly, approached the lady, as she stood apart, at the entrance to one of the side walks of the garden. \" I hope there is no bad news, Laura, about your uncle,\" said he. \" On the contrary,\" said the lady, \" he is much better.\" \" I am delighted to hear it,\" said the husband, heartily. He soon saw that he had not made ex actly the correct observation, for his wife's brow grew still darker. Presently he began again. \" Since that is the case,\" said he, \" I think \u2014 perhaps \u2014 I might as well \u2014 \" \" What ?\" said the lady, turning sharply. \" Well, Laura, then, to tell you the truth,"], [269, "261 VALETTA, I don't wish to make you uneasy, but I find, by the papers, that our government is by no means steady, and that we may suddenly, at a moment's notice, be obliged to go into opposition again.\" \" Ah ! is it so V said the lady, becoming more interested. \"Yes, indeed. And, therefore, I think, perhaps, I had better go up to town, at once, and see what can be done about this Colonial business.\" \" What forethought ! This for you is wonderful,\" exclaimed the lady. \u2022' Well, you see\" \u2014 began her husband. \" Are you sure you have no arriere pensee? said she, shaking her head with an arch smile. \" Come,\" thought he, \" this is beginning to look promising. We shall escape a scene after all.\" \" You hesitate,\" said the lady. \" Arriere pensee ! How can you suppose such a thing,\" exclaimed the husband. \" And by jove,\" thought he, \"if I look sharp"], [270, "262 VALETTA. I shall be in time to get off at the same time as that little Benchurch girl. \" Well really then, since it is a matter of importance, and as my poor old uncle seems getting better \u2014 perhaps you might venture,\" said the lady \u2014 I, of course, shall stay here for the present.\" \" Of course,\" said the husband, readily, \" At his time of life you know the \u2014 \" \" Exactly ! At his time of life one can never be certain. These apparent im provements are very deceiving \u2014 and some times \u2014 \" Here the lady paused for a second while she bent down her head to a flower. \" Sometimes,\" she added, \" after such a change, the patient goes off very suddenly \u2014There\u2014\" And as she spoke, she rapidly raised her face, over which a deep flush had spread itself. \" There is a compliment I am paying you."], [271, "VALETTA. 263 She placed a flower in her husband's button hole. It was a white rose. Women have often a secret meaning, of which their most trifling and apparently indifferent acts are emblematical \u2014 a sort of symbolical language of the existence of which the men by whom they are sur rounded have either no idea whatever, or of which they only catch occasional glimpses. The husband was not the man to trouble himself with such matters. He was be ginning to doubt in his own mind whether, if his wife detained him much longer, he should, after all, be able to get off with the Merryton. The keen glance of the lady was turned upon his face, and noted the uneasy ex pression which was beginning to fix itself there. \" They do indeed,\" said she, earnestly \u2014 don't you remember old lady \u2014 \" \" Do what V said he, peevishly."], [272, "264 VALETTA. Die suddenly,\" said the lady. Bah ! I was not thinking of that.\" \" Well, if you really insist on going,\" said the wife with a little shrug. And so the husband made his adieus, and was rewarded for his prompt decision by being in time to catch the Merryton before her departure. That charming young person had been, in fact, rather delayed in consequence of having conceived a sudden desire to go up and pay a visit to her dearest little Rhoda, and had positively wandered off by herself on an exploring expedition in search of the nursery which after many wrong doors, among them the Squire's, she at length reached. At the door of the sick room Scammony had arrested her progress for a moment, and requested her to send back his carriage to Benchurch, as he intended to remain where he was all night. On at length arriving at the nursery"], [273, "265 VALETTA door, the young lady had met with another obstacle, an obstacle which even she could not overcome. It was locked. She did her best however, and knocked away vigorously. \" Who's there ?\" cried Rhoda, from within. \" Only me, my little dear ! I have come to pay you a visit.\" Rhoda was very sorry indeed, but de clared roundly that she could not let her friend in, as she was engaged ou particular business \u2014 an announcement which must have afforded her infinite satisfaction, as it almost said in other words that after all she was not such a very little dear. The Merryton then, after exchanging a few remarks, and passing a little scruti nizing glance through the key-hole, and fancying as she held her breath to listen, that she could catch the sound of whisper ing voices inside the room, made up her mind that Rhoda was \" an artful little VOL.

That gentleman explained that he was on his way to town\u2014 that time was of importance to him \u2014 and bowed. The lady explained in return that curiously enough Mr. Scammony 's carriage was about to return to Benchurch, with her grandmama, who was afraid of the wind in an open carriage \u2014 that conse quently in her pony-carriage \u2014 Here she hesitated, blushed and became confused. How could the gentleman sufficiently express his thanks for her kindness. Old lady Marrwell was forthwith pro duced, and leaving behind her strict in junctions as to her missing trinket, was huddled into the doctor's carriage, and hurried rapidly off towards her home. Immediately behind her followed the pony-equipage, in which the fair enchan tress of Benchurch, radiant with triumph,"], [275, "267 VALETTA. bore off as a new evidence of the potency of her spells, this gentleman who was only too willing to exchange his legitimate bon dage for a voluntary captivity by her side. 2? 2"], [276, "268 VALETTA. CHAPTER XIII. The Doctor having again assumed his authority over his old patient declared that absolute quiet was essential to his recovery, and that it was necessary to ex clude his relatives from his room \u2014 and so strictly did he enforce this rule that even Rhoda herself was forbidden to enter, and obliged to content herself with sending her very best love to her dear grandpapa, and her humble hopes that he would forgive her all her crimes \u2014 a message which had"], [277, "VALETTA. 269 the effect of greatly relieving her mind, and which Scammony took good care should not be delivered. Peggy alone was allowed to assist the Doctor, an honourable office which she fulfilled with even more zeal and ineffi ciency than usual. The old Squire recognized her as she ministered around his bed, and murmured out. \" Poor old Peg ! Poor old lass !\" How the woman as she went stumbling about determined to treasure up those little words as a sufficient reason and ex cuse for inexhaustible love and gratitude on her part. As the day wore on the Squire began, under the Doctor's treatment, to make way. His strength was evidently return ing to him by degrees, and he manifested a growing inclination to converse, which the other made a point of checking. \" There's plenty of time, my dear sir, to talk, and plenty to talk about, when you"], [278, "270 VALETTA. are strong enough to bear the exertion ; in tbe mean time, here's a Uttle draught I wish you to \u2014 \" \" Tain't rhubub by any chance is it,\" murmured the old man. \" Not at all\u2014 not at all, my dear sir.\" \" Oh, wery good \u2014 'cause I'm dead against rhubub.\" \" No, no \u2014 we are not going to give yon rhubarb, my dear sir.\" \"Humph!\" \" Something strengthening.\" \"Humph!\" \" But remember, that after all, the best tonic is rest, and the absence of all excite ment.\" And in this summary manner the old gentleman was ordered off to sleep again \u2014 and what is more, obeyed the order im mediately. The evening wore away, and it was deep night. Far away, at the other side of the house, in her own distant and solitary chamber,"], [279, "271 VALETTA. Mrs. Stiltmarche was pacing rapidly to and fro \u2014 a prey to the strongest and most Con flicting emotions. There was enough in her position to overwhelm the strongest with anxiety, and as she, at intervals, paused to trim the little lamp, which threw its dim ray amidst the deep shadows of the apartment, her dark and working face bore marks of the struggle which was going on within. Up to a certain point her undertaking had prospered almost beyond her hopes. She had obtained, from the weakness of the old man, an instrument, which was to crown her triumph \u2014 the WILL! which was to give her wealth ; still better, which was to ruin her enemies, and place them utterly in her power \u2014 and when all was on the point of being accomplished \u2014 at the very hour when her power, and her wealth were on the point of being secured to her by the fading away \u2014 by the slow but certain flickering out of the old man. who lay there in the safe custody and keeping"], [280, "272 VALETTA. of her trusty Vowlett ; in step strangers \u2014 absolute strangers, who have nothing to do with the matter, and nothing to gain or lose, and who were, at that very moment, in the act of frustrating the plan which she had so boldly devised, and so ruth lessly executed \u2014 in the very act of wresting from her all the fruits, of her efforts. Nor was that all. For if that old man should recover, who could say what colour the transaction might assume . He might deny the will \u2014 He might declare that it had been forced from him. That his strength was purposely reduced \u2014that his mind was enfeebled \u2014 that his servants and relatives, and even his medical attendant, were kept away from him. Certainly the transaction might take an awkward colouring. And, at any rate, this point was beyond a doubt \u2014 namely, that wdien the old man came to read over again the document which he had signed, he would, from that moment, be for ever"], [281, "VALETTA. 273 alienated from her \u2014his niece ; and that all hope of further assistance and profit from this quarter would be at an end. As the lady walked to and fro turning all these matters over in her mind, there was a gentle knock at her door, and with stealthy footfall, and anxious, crafty face, the faithful Vowlett entered. Having secured the door carefully, she approached her mistress. \" Well, Vowlett,\" said the lady, \" what news.\" The woman shook her head with ominous import. The lady threw herself into the huge, old arm-chair by the side of the table, and hid her face in her hands. \" If he recover,\" murmured she, \" all is over \u2014 we are ruined !\" \" If? said the maid, with a peculiar emphasis. Suddenly the lady raised herself again, and looked enquiringly into the other's face. x 5"], [282, "274 VALETTA. \" If he recover,\" said she, slowly \u2014 \" Is there a doubt, then V Vowlett cleared her throat, and cast an uneasy glance towards the door. She drew a chair to the side of the table, and seated herself opposite to her mistress. \" There need not be a doubt,\" said she, in a low tone. \" But the risk,\" said the lady, shaking her head. \" It is not greater than the risk we have already run.\" \" Impossible !\" said the lady, throwing herself back in her chair, and again cover ing her face, as if to exclude some horrible image. \" It cannot be !\" \" And yet,\" said the woman, slowly, and striving, as she spoke, to catch a glimpse of her mistress's face through the hands which concealed it ; \" and yet it is almost a pity \u2014 when there is so much to gain.\" The lady remained motionless. \" When there is so much to lose.\" Still the lady gave no sign."], [283, "VALETTA. 275 \" When others will gain, who \u2014 \" A slight contraction of the muscles of the upraised hands. Well did the watch ful tempter note it. \" When it could be so easily \u2014 so very easily\u2014 so safely done. When there is really nothing to do -when it is done already.\" \" What do you mean ?\" murmured the lady. The maid glanced at the door, and then, lowering her tone, said, \" The Doctor has gone to lie down in one of the rooms, at the other side of the house.

The night wore on, and on, and still the lady sat there in her chair, a prey to her thoughts. \u2014 Again and again she dismissed the terrible train of tempting ideas, and again and again they returned upon her. \" It is lonely watching, this,\" said she at length, rousing herself with an effort, and casting her eyes round the room. Her glance settled on the picture, \u2014 that picture which placed before her mind the hated wife of Clarence, with such painful reality. \" After all, they will triumph,\" she ex-"], [287, "valetta. 279 claimed, as her eyes flashed ; \" and through my weakness, \u2014 my curses, my bitter cur ses on you both.\" \u2014 As she spoke, she started back, for there again, close to her very ear, she heard that terrible sound, \u2014 that strange, sobbing sigh. To remain longer in that mysterious chamber was impossible. Without a moment's hesitation, without even daring to turn her head, lest some sight should present itself, too horrible for human vision to endure, she seized up the lamp, and hastened from the room. And now, where should she go 1 Go ! \u2014 why, was it not her duty to go to her uncle, when she knew that his watchers were betraying their duty ? \u2014 Who could say but that at that very moment in which she stood there, he might be in need of assistance. \u2014 Certainly that was where she would go.

A night-light is faintly glimmering in the room.

Where is it 1\" The old man raised his head, and the lady lowered the deadly potion to his lips. The last moment of the last Hardyman had arrived. No \u2014 not quite. There was still a sand left in the glass of life. At that instant, the curtains, on the op posite side of the bed, were agitated, as by a breath of night air, then they moved slowly aside \u2014 and there \u2014 from out of the"], [295, "287 VALETTA. darkness, there rose up, confronting the two guilty women, an awful figure \u2014 gaunt and deadly \u2014 its pale face wrapped around with death cloths. It was that fatal ap parition \u2014 that never-forgotten face \u2014 that gaze of the picture \u2014 that stony gaze of the dead\u2014 the dreadful LADY OF NOR LEY. For a single instant, the lady fixed her eyes upon it, and then, in the next, she fell senseless upon the floor, while the other woman rushed shrieking from the room. Up started Peggy from her trance, and, in the next moment, in rushed the Doctor. There were few who could have slept while those wild, shrill, conscience- wrung screams were echoing through the house. \" What, in the name of Heaven has hap pened V he exclaimed. \"Oh \u2014 what has happened \u2014 oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear \u2014 Can't they let us be?\" cried Peggy-"], [296, "288 VALETTA. There lay the lady on the ground. The doctor stooped to raise her. He opened her clenched hand, and took from it a little phial. He raised it to the light. It was labelled \"Laudanum.\" He put it to his nostrils, for a moment \u2014 and then slipped it quietly into his pocket. \" Peggy,\" said he, with a peculiar glance, \" go and tell the child not to be frightened. Madame Stiltmarche has had a fit. She will be better directly.\" Peggy presently returned. In the meantime, the doctor had carefully re moved all the medicine, the glass, and the napkin, on which a portion of its contents had been spilt. The trembling Vowlett was sum moned. \" So your mistress has had a fit V said the Doctor. \" Is she subject to them ?\" \" Rather,\" said the woman. \" Ah !\" replied the Doctor ; \" we must see about it.\""], [297, "VALETTA. 289 And then he gave directions for the re moval of the lady, who still continued in sensible. While this operation, which was under taken by the faithful Vowlett and Peggy, was in progress, the Squire's voice was heard from his bed. The Doctor went to him. \" They're a wasting the doctor's stuff again,\" said he. No answer. \" You'd a hand in it, I reckon V \" I had.\" \" Then cuss me if 1 takes a drop more.\" The Doctor considered, for a moment, and then, shaking his head, remained silent. \" I want to get to sleep,\" said the old man, closing his eyes ; \" where's Peg V \"I shall remain with you for the rest of the night,\" said the Doctor. \" Peggy's un usually sleepy.\" VOL.

After the past anxious night, the morn ing's sun ushered in a day very important to the little circle at Norley. No sooner was breakfast over, than the whole household, without exception, were summoned to the sick room of the old Squire, and all felt that something greatly out of the ordinary course of events, was about to happen. By the side of the old man's bed sat the Doctor, his keen eyes glancing from face o 3"], [300, "292 VALETTA to face, and his mouth screwed up into so serious a grimace, that it was evident he was inwardly enjoying the general confusion and dismay. Before the fire sat Madame Stiltmarche, counting stitches, and working away most earnestly at a piece of tapestry, represent ing Judith with the head of Holofernes. Lingering by the door, as if ready for an instant retreat, stood the faithful Vow lett. There was a quick, nervous play about the muscles of her face, find her eyes glanced furtively first at the Doctor then at her mistress, then at the closed cur tains of the bed, and then, after they had, for a moment, turned themselves as if to seek consolation and support from the ceiling, they finally rested on the floor. Btside her, and eyeing her askance, stood Jacob, quite prepared to become the victim of serious calamity, but endeavour ing to look highly intellectual and moral under impending misfortune. Near tbe window stood Peggy, likewise"], [301, "293 VALETTA. enproie to the gloomiest forebodings. And half behind her, the little Rhoda, her hands clasped together, her eyes cast down, ready to plead guilty to all charges which might be brought against her. The Squire \"hemmed\" with startling loudness. \" Draw my curtains,\" said he, in a full, strong voice. The Doctor drew aside the curtains, so that the old gentleman could see all round the room. There he was, propped up with pillows, invested in his old brown, great coat, with his yellow handkerchief round his neck. It was evident, then, that he was free again. But he was about to give more conclusive evidence than this of his re covered liberty. He kept his eyes closed, and his face slightly raised, as if he were determined not to see any one. On the other hand, no one ventured to look directly at him, though all cast little half glances."], [302, "294 VALETTA. \" Scam,\" said the old man, still with his eyes shut, \" go to my leddy and ask her for my keys.\" The lady had not the keys, they were on the mantel-piece, and so, in a gentle voice, without raising her eyes from her work, she told the Doctor, when he went creak ing across the room to her, in obedience to the Squire's order. There was a pause of expectation. \" Doctor,\" said the old man, \" go to the cabinet next the window, and open the top part.\" All eyes followed the Doctor, who took the opportunity of his back being turned upon the Squire to frown desperately at Peggy, and to indulge in a little pantomime, giving her to understand that her doom was sealed, and that she would meet with no sympathy from him. Poor Teggy ! It was with a feeling of utter misery that she saw him take out a large folded paper, tied with red tape, which he secretly pointed at her. Alas ! she felt too certain that"], [303, "295 VALETTA. she beheld all the wages which the Squire had, from time to time, put by for her, and which she was now doomed to receive prior to her expulsion from paradise. \" You've got the dociment,\" said the old man. \" Yes, sir.\" The Squire paused, wiped his face feebly with a handkerchief, and then said, with a general glance. \" I've been wery weak-like, these some days past, and \u2014 \" There was a sigh at the door, and a mur mured sound of \"Ah ! poor dear old gen tleman!\". In a moment, the Squire was looking in tently at the ceiling again. \"If old mother Wowlett should chance to come into the room,\" said he, \" yer may kick her out Scam \u2014 I'm a magistrate, and I'll give yer leave.\" There was a slight rustle, another sigh, a gentle turning of the handle of the door, and the Doctor hastened to say \u2014"], [304, "296 VALETTA. \" She's not here, sir \u2014 she's not here.\" \" Ah ! wery good,\" said the old man \u2014 \" only, if in case she should come, in course \u2014 \" Rhoda and Peggy exchanged glances. This sounded something like hope. So thought Jacob, and so confidently, too, that he could not refrain from signalizing this reverse of tbe enemy, by a loud \" hem.' Again the old gentleman spoke. \" In case Jacob Titman, as is going to buy up my property, is in the room, he may bide a bit. I'll have a word with him presently, r'raps,\" added he, stroking his face down, in the old fashion, \" p'raps we may have a deal together.\" The little domestic cabal was plunged into despair again. \" I'd have yer to know, Scam,\" said the old gentleman, \"I made a will a day or two ago \u2014 I don't rightly know when \u2014 and I don't rightly know what's in it \u2014 so p'raps, if agreeable to all parties \u2014 you'll just tear off the signature, and put it in"], [305, "297 VALETTA the fire, now we're all here, so that there may be no mistake about the matter. And as to the rest of the dociment, I'll keep it to look over when I've time.\" The Doctor did as he was bid. How the paper sounded as he tore it \u2014 how it blazed up as he threw it into the fire \u2014 how he held it down with the tongs \u2014 how he rubbed his hands when all was over \u2014 how every one noticed all this, for there was not another sound in the room. The lady sat by the fire counting her stitches more intently than ever. Presently the Squire spoke again. \"Asking my leddy's pardon, I'll make so bold as to say, that I'm much obliged to her for her company, and won't detain her any more \u2014 seeing that 1 was nigh upon having a bad night \u2014 aud feel rather weak like.\" The lady stuck her needle into the head of Holofernes \u2014 folded up her work care sally \u2014 placed it in her bag and left the room without a look or a word."], [306, "298 VALETTA. The Squire whispered to the Doctor, who desired Jacob to go round to the other side of the bed, and stand forth by the side of Teggy. The Squire \" hem'd\" awfully. \" So you're a going to buy up my pro perty, are yer, sir,\" said he, abruptly. Jacob faltered, and turned away his head. Rhoda, yielding to an irresistible impulse, stepped forward to intercede for her old friend. \" Stand aside, gal,\" said the Squire, \" your turn'll come soon enough.\" The old gentleman resumed, fiercely. \" Yer won't buy my land, sir \u2014 it's not for sale \u2014 not just yet, any how. If you wants it though, there's another way of getting a slice of it, and it's the only way I know of.\" Every one stared, except the Doctor, who frowned again at Peggy, and shook his head sorrowfully, as much as to say\u2014 \" My good woman, your doom is sealed.\" \" There's a certain lass, as I'm a going"], [307, "VALETTA. 299 to give a deed to,\" continued the Squire, \" a deed o' gift all reg'lar \u2014 in con \u2014 sidera tion of waley received \u2014 long and faithful services. It's only a matter of twenty acres and a cot \u2014 but it's hearty land, and it's heartily your'n, Teg, my lass. And so, my little chap, if you wants the land, you must needs take the lass with it. What say you to it, eh ?\" The man said not a word, he was aston ished out of his speech ; and indeed even Rhoda opened her eyes at her nurse, wider than she had ever done before, and her nurse, for the first time, was unable to meet her gaze \u2014 Poor Peggy ! That rusty red old face of hers became most wonderfully flushed \u25a0 \u2014 more so even than when five minutes be fore she had stood with her cap over one eye, and her hair in the other, folding her apron and listening to the first words of the fierce commencement of her master's speech to Jacob. Poor old Peg ! The Doctor, now that there was no pos sibility of mystifying the folks any longer,"], [308, "300 VALETTA. entered into a whispered conversation with the Squire. When the old man turned round again he found Peggy Franko with her arm tucked under that of Jacob, and Miss Rhoda looking very hard out of win dow. \" Oh, wery good,\" said he, \"since that matter's settled, you can be off to help my leddy pack up her traps.\" The pair seemed to hesitate for a moment as to the order of their going, and then, without uttering a word, they walked off out of the room arm-in-arm. Scammony cast a single glance at Rhoda, who had turned from the window, and then he followed, probably to enjoy a little banter at poor Peggy's expense. The Squire threw himself back on his pillow, and closed his eyes, Rhoda feeling that her turn was now come, stood blushing, and with the tears trembling in her eyes. \" Come hither, gal,\" said the old man, in a faint voice. The child advanced to the side of the"], [309, "301 VALETTA. bed. The Squire peeped at her for a mo ment, out of the corner of one eye. \" So you've been and took in a letter from \u2014 foreign parts.\" \" I've been a very wicked and ungrate ful child, dear grandpapa,\" faltered she, adopting the words of her cousin. \" Humph ! Are you sure you ain't got no more ?\" \" Quite, dear grandpapa.\" \" Humph ! Worse luck \u2014 I say \u2014 there ain't no body here, is there '_\" \" No ! dear grandpapa.\" \" Quite sure ?\" \" Quite ! dear grandpapa.\" \" I think I'll just \u2014 just \u2014 just take a look at the letter then \u2014 my leddy put it in the top drawer to the left.\" The trembling child brought the letter and placed it in the hands of the old man. How they shook as he clutched it. \" Give me my glasses,\" said he. No, it would not do. He shook his head. He took his glasses off again."], [310, "302 VALETTA. \" They're uncommon dim-like,\" said he, as be laid his head down upon his pillow, the tears trickling from beneath his closed eye-lids. \" Rhoda, gal,\" said he, presently, in a faint voice. \" Yes, dear grandpapa.\" \" I shall never see her again.\" There was a silence. \" When I'm dead and gone,\" resumed the old man, \" tell her I never knowed till too late how she'd been served. \u2014 T'other one \u2014 the mother \u2014 married a fool, as tootled his life through the holes of a fife \u2014 but he wa'rnt a willain like this hair-dressing chap.

For some time the silence was only broken by the suppressed sound of her sobs. Presently the old man said abruptly \u2014 \"How's tbe wind?\" The child went to the window, and stood looking out. The light seemed to distress the old man \u2014 he turned on his pillow, with his face to the wall. \" Oh dear,\" he murmured, \" it's a wicked world, I've had enough of it \u2014 I want my gal \u2014 where's my gal?'' As he spoke \u2014 from among the folds of the curtains a pair of soft round arms stretched themselves forth and twined about his old great coat \u2014 a fair and graceful woman's form was there, on bended knees beside him \u2014 clinging to him \u2014 nest ling to his heart ; and a lovely and well re membered, and well loved face laid itself"], [312, "304 VALETTA. on the pillow at his side, while a little, gentle supplicating voice whispered in his ear \u2014 \" If you please, dear grandpapa \u2014 \" \" Wa-let-ta, my own gal,\" murmured the old man, as his arms closed around her \u2014 \" I humbly thank my God.\" Another year had passed away, and the old man who, after fourscore years, had began to thank his God, had yet life and health to be thankful for \u2014 Aye, and he had still more to be thankful for, too \u2014 and thankful \u2014 humbly thankful was he for those twin loving hearts \u2014 for those fair sisters who ministered at his pillow \u2014 who ever hovered around his chair, and who he felt would never neglect his grave.\u2014 For even such a subject as this he would now meet face to face."], [313, "305 VALETTA. The fact is, the two girls had acquired a great influence over the old man during this year, and they had used it thus : they had got down from the back of the study shelves a certain secret, sacred, volume, long the repository of receipts, notes of hand, and other solemn memoranda, and to please them the old fellow would listen as they read of a night when he had finished his back-gammon. After these readings he would shake his head, sigh, declare that it was all true enough \u2014 that we live in a wicked world, and so saying he would take up the county paper. At other times he would, when the reading was about to commence, beg hard for the book of Proverbs \u2014 There was something in them which suited his humour \u2014 He was never weary of patronizing King Solomon, and declared that the Monarch \" knowed pretty well which way the wind blowed.\" But still the girls were not happy, for they fancied that the old man yielded"], [314, "306 VALETTA. himself to all this for the sake of giving them pleasure, and making them easy in their minds. One night, however, the reading having beenintermitted,theold man shut himself up in his study. When the girls, who had now the right of entering this mystic haunt at will, came suddenly upon him, they found him with that great black book open before him, and with his carpenter's pencil in his hand eagerly jotting down texts. That was a happy night in the old house, and many happy days succeeded it \u2014 Here is one of them, as a specimen. The sunshine sleeps on the soft green lawn, and the old ilex throws its best shadow for the sake of the group which is seated beneath its boughs. There is the old man in his easy chair \u2014"], [315, "307 VALETTA. the very justice chair itself. That black leather-covered volume is open on his knees \u2014 for he now no longer attempts to make a secret of the nature of his study \u2014 He has just taken a memorandum of a text upon a carefully folded business-like paper, and has closed his eyes to ponder on the sub ject. On one side of him is Rhoda, absorbed in an elaborate piece of needle- work, happy contentment reigning on her thoughtful face. . On the other side ofthe old man \u2014 rather behind him, and clandestinely resting her little hand upon his shoulder, is the other sister \u2014 Valetta. First she peeps at him as he sits there with closed eyes \u2014 then she gives a pat to Quirk, who is seated upon her lap, and is with infinite gravity doing his best to stare her out of countenance \u2014 then she quietly, so as not to disturb the grandpapa's reverie, tosses crumbs Of bread to the peacock and the pullets which, as they peck after insects, have always one"], [316, "308 VALETTA. eye towards her \u2014 then she exchanges a look with Juny, who is lying at the edge of the shadow of the ilex with her eyes and the tip of her nose in the shade, and all the rest of that luxurious body of hers in the sunshine \u2014 then she exchanges a nod with Peggy, who has paused for a moment in her work to come and flatten her nose against one of the upper windows with the express hope of arresting her mistress's little flitting glance for a moment \u2014 and then that glance of thegirlgrows more steady and sadder as it passes through the wide opened door of the churchyard, and settles down upon the mother's grave. Sadder and sadder are the shadows which creep and spread themselves over her face. Ah! what a sorrowing face is that of hers now \u2014 and would you know what helps its expression? It is a widow's cap. There are certain careers which honest lips whisper in a few words, and then pass away eagerly to something else \u2014 such a"], [317, "VALETTA. 309 career had been the husband's. A very short time after the young wife had been brought back by the Doctor, when he re turned from Ostende, a letter had been re ceived from the husband. It was a formally penned proposal, setting forth that he was willing to resign all claim to his wife on condition of receiving an annuity in com pensation. This effusion was sealed with the Countess's seal \u2014 a charming little im pression of a butterfly settling on a rose bud, with the motto \u2014 \" Fidele a mort.\" The Captain only received two quarterly in stalments of his annuity. However, after he had caught a cold (which killed him in three weeks,) the Countess wrote with her own hands alittle pathetic billet, explaining that all the money that ce pauvre jeune homme, M. le Capitaine, had received for the sale of his grade in the English army, had been expended in his efforts to arrange his affairs, and that still there was money owing, which the generosity \u2014 the justice of his family, &c. ; and again she impressed it"], [318, "310 VALETTA. with her little butterfly (a carrion crow would have been better) and her fidele d mort. He lies on the outside of a foreign graveyard, and the Countess has had a mass sung for his soul. We have no moral to grave over his tomb ; those who read for a moral must pick one out for themselves. As the party sat there in the garden, the old gentleman was suddenly brought back from his reverie, by a little sobbing sigh, from the young widow at his side. In stantly Rhoda paused in her work, and began to talk. This was always done directly that sigh was heard. \" How happy dear Peggy and Jacob seem now they are married,\" said Rhoda. They were happy in fact. Jacob was more important than ever, having now affairs of his own to manage, in addition to those of his master,. Peggy could never be induced to take possession of her cot, of her money, or in short of anything but her spelling-book and scrubbing brushes, which"], [319, "VALETTA 311 she wielded more assiduously than ever. The couple accordingly lived on at the Court, where Rhoda now ruled domestic matters. That young lady never could understand why Peggy had married. The more she thought over the matter the less she could account for it \u2014 any one else- \u2014 that would not have been so wonderful \u2014 but why Peggy should marry, that was beyond her ; and often she would take the unsophisticated bride into the store room, and offer a little bribe, and gaze wonder ingly at her, and then say \u2014 \" But why should you marry, dear Teggy ?\" And then Peggy would flush up and bless the child's little innocent heart, and take to flight ; but never could she answer, and so probably (like a great many more) she did not know why she had married, but she was not the less happy on that account. \" There is another marriage going to take place, too, dear grandpapa,\" said Rhoda \u2014 \" Miss Merryton.\""], [320, "312 VALETTA. \" The deuce, \u2014 I mean to say \u2014 oh ! dear,\" exclaimed the reformed old gentleman, \" t'aint for want of trying, if she don't go off. She's a precious ripe cherry, \u2014 that lass. If you so much as wink at the bough, off she falls, plump into your mouth. \u2014 Oh ! dear, who's she loodled at last ?\" \" Guess,\" dear grandpapa. \" T'aint Scam\u2014 I'll lay a farden.\" \" No, that it was not. Scam had no in tention of entering the silken bondage.

However, the most prevalent opinion among the ladies was, that he had been blighted in early life ; so that a little halo of sentiment was voted round that baldish pate of his, after all. No, the Merryton was married to Mr. Felix Oxton, and soon after the happy event, that young gentleman found out, for the first and last time in his life that, to use his own favourite phrase, \" he had done it, \u2014 rather.\" But as Rhoda talked on she soon observed that this subject of marrying, and giving in marriage, was not well selected to banish painful thoughts from the little widow's mind. She therefore took another topic, and wondered what had become of her cousin. If her wonderings could have been an swered she would have learned that the lady had, with her lord, taken possession of a remote colony, (aud what was more to the VOL. III. P"], [322, "314 VALETTA. purpose,) of its government house, from the windows of which she had many opportuni ties of looking through her opera glass, at the gangs of convicts as they passed to and fro to their retributive toils. \" Do you remember that last night when our dear cousin was here, and when you were so ill, dear, dear grandpapa,\" said Rhoda. Valetta turned away her head and begun to caress the dog, \u2014 and the old gentleman seemed anxious to escape from the subject. \" And do you remember when little Jacob seed the ghost ?\" said he, looking out keenly, and smiling behind the shelter of his hand. There was no answer, and both the girls were at once busy looking at Quirk, who had suddenly seized Juny by the ear, and was endeavouring to pull her into the sun's glare. The old gentleman quietly put out his hand, and gently took hold of the little ear of his elder granddaughter."], [323, "315 VALETTA. She held down her head still lower, and a blush spread itself over her neck. \u2014 Was she pleading guilty to an implied accusation 1 It can hardly be known ; but certainly there was a strong case of circumstantial evidence against some one. Thus when the young lady had returned, f under the care of the Doctor, after that last terrible night at the chateau, which, from that hour, she had never re-entered \u2014 she had been concealed for a week among those old rooms in the upper part of the house, with whose windings she was so well acquainted. None had knownof herpresence there, except, perhaps, the Doctor, Rhoda, and Peggy, who never would give very distinct information on the subject. This, however, is certain, that when these old, dismantled rooms came to be examined, it turned out that there was a communication, by means of them, over the hall\u2014 extending from the door opposite that of the Squire's to the room which had been occupied by Mrs. Stiltmarche. There had originally p 2"], [324, "316 VALETTA. been a little door leading into this latter room; but the entrance had been blocked up by a thin panel, from behind which the slightest sound in the room was audible. In one of these little, dark, upper rooms, there were found certain white garments of antique form which nobody would ever claim, or attempt to give an account of. Perhaps there was something tending to confuse in the recollection of all this, the girls remained silent \u2014 the elder one blushing more deeply than ever. \" Ah,\" said the old man, shaking his head archly, \" a pretty young baggage to go a frightening a little simpleton, like that Jacob, out of his wits.\" The girl suddenly turned up her blush ing face to him with that little charming, mutinous smile of old. \" Oh ! dear,\" murmured the old man, turning his head away. \" How uncom mon like her mother she's a getting.\" And now it was his turn to cast his"], [325, "VALETTA. 317 glance into the churchyard, and rest it on his daughter's grave, In that moment the dead woman was avenged. In that trembling, tearful glance she had a woman's true vengeance \u2014 the contrition of him who has wronged her \u2014 At last, she was admitted back again into the father's heart ; and in return for all she had suffered, she had a woman's true recom pense\u2014 the happiness of those she loves \u2014 Those dear children, who sat by the old man's side, had now his consent to deck her grave with those sweetest flowers \u2014 their pious, filial thoughts. At that moment, as they sat there, almost within the shadow of the sacred building, their fond piety readily persuaded them to the belief that, from above, that dear lost one \u2014 that dear hidden one \u2014 looked down upon them as they invoked her me mory at her tomb. The old man shared their thoughts, for now he took off that broad brimmed, rusty hat of his, and gave it to Rhoda to hold."], [326, "318 VALETTA. He clasped his hands together \u2014 his eyes closed, and his lips murmured in prayer.

This fiction exhibits a wider knowledge of life and much mor* of observation and reflection than the generality of novels. Ita most distinguished feature, however, is its style which is pointed aud pleasing in a high degree. n r\\r> ri LITERARY GAZETTE. ' U *?\"*\" The talent displayed in this novel is not of an ordinary character. Since the appearance of Romance and Reality, we have nowhere met with more pithy and epigrammatic remarks, stud ding the story as spangles do the fabric of a show dress. These palpable hits abound, and show an acute observation of men and manners. Squeal of Squeal-hall is an admirably painted portrait ; but it is at too full length for us to copy, and we trust we have done enough to awaken popular curiosity to this very clever production. OBSERVER. Anonymous, unpretending in appearance, and generally with out any of those external recommendations deemed indispensable by modern publishers, ' Denton Hall ' is, nevertheless one of the most amusing, the most varied, the best written, and most instructive works ot its class \u2014 novels \u2014 that has been laid before the public, since perhaps, the palmiest days of Scott. T-rkV r '_-. .snr<'iTiw/inT. BELL S MESSENGER. \" Denton Hall,\" comes out anonymously, without the pres tige of any great name, and without the high sounding recom mendation of the author's former fame ; and yet it is impossible to read the first fevv chapters without making the discovery that it is a work of no ordinary merit. The narrative is so truthful and yet so devoid of exaggeration, either of style or matter, that the reader is imperceptibly hurried forward and induced to go on to the end. There are many striking scenes introduced, especially in the third volume, which are so vividly drawn as to excite the strongest emotions. But where all is so excellent it is invidious to particularize ; for the work is upon the whole so clever and ably prepared as to carry with it its own recommenda tion. NAVAL & MILITARY GAZETTE. ' Denton Hall/ is in fact very smartly and cleverly written, and it evinces on the part of the author, a sound and extensive ac quaintance with human nature and the world at large. THE YOUNG DOCTOR.

TIMES. Mr. Maccabe's mode of composition is as novel as his plan. Sacrificing ordinary literary pride, he makes the old Monkish writers compose the narrative\u2014 his ingenuity being displayed in the skill with which the passages, translated directly from the original, with all their natural vigour of language are con nected, so as to produce an appearance of oneness of design and continuity. He then fuses into one whole centuries of observa tion and narrative, and in fast revives those dead monks and scribes till they write his book. The plan is not only new, but it was necessary, as the reader will find if he compare the garbled and inaccurate version given by Hume and some other writers, with the original statements of the same events incorporated in these pages. He will also be better able to understand, when this universality of authorities is explained, why this book should be called a ' Catholic History.' The work is of great literary value. ECONOMIST.
