Charity, fays St. Paul, behaves not it self unseemly 5 is not untoward, uncivil or clownish, in Word, in Carriage, or in Deed. It is in Truth, the most civi lizing and most polishing Disposition that can be ; nothing does render a Man so com- pleatly genteel, not in an affected or artificial Way, consisting in certain Postures, or Mo tions of the Body, dopping, cringing, &c. Nor in forms of Expressions, or modish Ad- dresses, which Men learn like Parrots, and vent by Rote, usually not meaning any Thing by them, often with them disguising Fraud and Rancour ; but in a real and natu ral Manner, suggested by good Judgment and hearty Affection. A charitable Man per haps may not be guilty of Courtship, or may be unpractis'd in the Modes of Address 5 but he will not be deficient in the Substance of paying every one proper and due Respect : This indeed is true Courtesy, grounded on Reason, and proceeding from the Heart, which"], [27, "3 which therefore is far more genuine, more sqlid, more steady than that which is built on Fashion, and issuing forth from Affectati on ; the which indeed does only ape or coun terfeit the Deportment of Charity.

B 2 Dt."], [28, "4 Dr. Barrow on JESTING. JESTING, when not used upon improper Matter, in an unfit Manner, with exces sive Measure, at undue Season, or to evil Purpose, may be -allow'd. When Jesting is so handsomely and innocently used, as not to defile or discompose the Mind of the Spea ker, not to wrong or harm the Hearer, not to derogate from any worthy Subject of Dis course, not to infringe Decency, to disturb Peace, to violate any of the grand Duties in cumbent on us, (viz. Piety, Charity, Justice, and Sobriety,) it cannot be condemned. Mr. Collier on DESPAIR DESPAIR makes a despicable Figure, and descends from a mean Original. 'Tis the Offspring of Fear, of Laziness, and Impatience; its argues a defect of Spirit and Resolution, and oftentimes Of Honesty too. I would not Despair, unless I saw my Mis fortune recorded in the Book of Fate, and sign'd and seal'd by Necessity.

I would not quit my Hold as long as it was within the Reach of Omnipotence. What then, must we hope without Means ? Yes, Why not ? When we cannot work them out with our own Industry; Pray what Means was there to make the World with? He that made second Causes, can as easily work without, as with them. But is it not extravagant to expect a Mi racle ? Not at all ; I believe we are assisted with many more Miracles than we are a ware of. Let no Man therefore disquiet him self about the Future, nor quit a just Under taking out of Despondency. .MTrebeck on AFFLICTION TH E Wisdom of God, sent Nimrods into the World even in the earliest Ages, to discipline his Servants timely to inure them to all Passive Virtues : And the Canaanites and the Jebufites were Po- liticly continued, to be Scourges on the Sides, and Thorns in the Eyes of his most distinguish'd Favourites.

DrBuRNET BESIDES the ordinary Providence of God, there is doubtless an extraordinary Pro vidence that does attend great Scenes and great Revolutions. It would be a Limita tion of the Divine Power and Will, so to be bound up to second Causes, as never to use, upon occasion, an extraordinary Influence or Pirection; but 'tis hard to separate and distinguish"], [31, "7 distinguish an ordinary and extraordinary Providence in all Cases, and to mark just how far one goes, and where the other begins. Dr. Bur net on Interpretation of the SCRIPTURES. THE general Rule of Interpretation of Scripture is this, that we are not to de from the Letter, or the litteral Sense, unless there, be a Necessity from the subject Matter, such a Necessity, as makes a literal Interpretation absurd. Dr. Bur net on Astronomy. TH E plain Truth is, the Planets are so many Earths, and our Earth is as much a Planet as the brightest of them ; 'tis carried about the Sun with the fame common Stream, and shines with as much Lustre to them as they do to us ; neither can they do any more Harm to it, than it can do to them. 'Tis now well known, that the Planets and dark opake Bodies, are generally made up of Earth and Water, as our Globe is, and have no Force or Action, but that of reverbera ting the Light, which the Sun casts upon them. The blind superstitious Fear orReve- B 4 rence"], [32, "8 fence for the Stars, had its Original from the ancient Idolaters. They thought them Gods, and that\" they had Dominion over human Affairs. We do not indeed worship them as they did ; but some Men retain still the fame Opinion of their Virtues ; of their Rule and Influence upon us, and our Affairs, which was the ground of their Worship. Tis full time now to sweep away those Cobwebs of Super- stition, those Relicks of Paganism. I do not ice how we are any more concern'd in the Postures of the Planets, than in the Postures of the Clouds; and we may as well build an Art of Prediction or Divination upon the one as the other; they must not know much of the Philosophy of the Heavens, or little consider it, that think the Fate of either single Persons, or ot the whole Earth, can depend upon the Aspects or figur'd Dances of those Bodies.

IF a Man's Mind be truly inflam'd with the Heat of Love and Charity, he shall be exalted to a great Degree of Perfection ; all other Human Excellencies which we admire, though they advance Nature, yet they are subject to Excess, only Charity ad mits no Excess; we fee the Angels, while they aspir'd to be like God in Power, preva ricated and fell ; so Man, while he aspir'd to be like God in Knowledge, digress'd and fell ; but by aspiring to a Similitude of God's Goodness and Love, neither Man nor Angel ever was endanger'd, nor shall ever be en da nger'd. C On"], [42, "18 On a right and good Mind. A Right and good Mind should be sound and free from Perturbations, beautiful, and grac'd with the Ornaments of true De cency ; strong to all Duties of Life, not Stu pid, but retaining an active and lively Sense of Pleasure and honest Recreation ; but these four good Qualities seldom meet together ; many have strength of Wit and Courage, who yet are infested with Passions, having no Elegancy nor beauty of Behaviour in their Doings. Some again have an Elegancy and fineness of Carnage, which have neither Honesty nor Substance in their Actions ; some have honest Minds, purify'd from the Stain of Guilt, which can neither become themselves, nor manage Business ; and others capable of these three Qualities, but possess'd with a Stoical Humour, of sullen Sadness and Stupidity, who practise Virtue, but do not enjoy it.

Qietro"], [43, "19 Cicero says, Affability does not chiefly consist in this, for a Man to give easy Access to his Person, unless likewise he receive People Couteously, even with his Coutenance; if the Government of the Face and Countenance alone be of such Effect, how much more is that of familiar Speech and other Carriage appertaining to Conversation ; indeed the Sum and Abridgement of the grace and ele gancy of Behaviour, is for the most part tompriz'd in this, that we measure in a just Ballance, and maintain both our own Ho- Dour, and the Reputation of others, lest we should seem either Arrogant, or Obnoxious ; the one being the Humour of a Man that forgets the Liberty of another, the other of a Man that forgets the Liberty of himself j but on the other fide, if Urbanity, and out ward Elegancy of Behaviour be intended too much, they pass into a deform'd and coun terfeit Affectation, or at least are liable so to do ; the comely grace of Behaviour is as it were the Garment of the Mind, and there fore must have the Conditions of a Garment; for first, it ought to be such as is in fashion ; again, it ought not to be too curious, or costly ; then it ought to be so fhap'd, as to set forth any good making of the Mind, and to supply and hide any Deformity; lastly, and above all, it ought not to be t<So strait. or so to restrain the Spirit, as to repress, ana hinder the Motion thereof in Business, C * On"], [44, "20 On Choice of Friends. Choice of Friends, and inward De | pendencies, consult your own Nature and Disposition, and proceed according to the Composition of your own Temper ; for dif ferent Constitutions require different kinds of Friends to comply with all. On Example. LET a Man take heed how he guides him- self by Examples, and that he do not fondly affect the Imitation of others, as if that which is previous to others, must needs be as a Pattern to him, never considering with himself what Difference there is perhaps be twixt his and their Natures and Carriages, whom he has chosen tor his Pattern and Ex ample. On too much Good Nature. LET not a Man dismantle himself, and expose his Person to Scorn and Injury, by his too much Goodness and facility of Nature 3 but rather in all Things show some Sparkles and Edges of a free and generous Spi- rit,"], [45, "21 rit, that carries with it as well a Sting as Honey. On Fortune. LE T the Wheels of your Mind be complyable and voluble with the Wheels of your Fortune ; for by taking a- way, and smoothing the Impediments and Rules of the Mind, you shall sooner open a way to Fortune, than by the Assistance of Fortune, take away the Impediments of the Mind. Let us look about us, on every side, and observe where Things are open, where shut and obstructed, where easy, where .dif ficult to be compass'd, that we do not over strain and mis-imploy our Strength, where the Way is not passable. On God's Law and Word. AS we are to obey God's Law, though we find a Reluctation in our Will, so we are to believe his Word, though we find a Reftictation in our E.eason ; for if we believe only that which is agreeable to our own Rea son, we give Assent to the Matter, not to the Author, which is no more than we would do to a suspected and discredited Witness. C 2 On"], [46, "22 On Wisdom and Business, THERE is Difference between that Wis- dom which is grown, and ripen'd into true Habit, and that which swims only in the Brain and Conceit, or is boasted in Speech, but has not taken Root 3 and there are two differing kinds in Sufficiency of managing Affairs, and handling Business 3 for some can make use of Occasions aptly and dexterously, but can plot and excogitate nothing3 some are all for Plots which they can well urge and pursue, but cannot accommodate and take ffi, either of which Abilities is maim'd and :mperfect without the other. On Caution in Friendship, SO love a Man as yet thou may'st be* come an Enemy ; so hate a Man as yet thou may'st become his Friend ; for it utter ly betrays all Utility, and frustrates it, for a Man to imbark himself too far in unfortu pate Friendships.

EMBRACE not any Matters which do occupy too great a quantity of Time 3 but have that Verse ever sounding in your Ears, Sed fugit interia, fugit irraparabile tem pus. God sets apart, and demands for him self, a Tenth of our Substance, and a Seventh of our Time. On Laws. IT is a hard Cafe to torture Laws, that they may torture Men ; I would not therefore that Laws Penal, much less Capital, should be extended to new Offences ; yet if it be an old Crime, and known to the Laws, but the Pro secution thereof falls upon a new Cafe, not foreseen by the Laws, we must by all means depart from the Placits of Law, rather than that Offences pass unpunifh'd. On Words. MENS Words are (as Physicians fay of Waters) full of Flattery and Uncer tainty ; yet the Counterfeit is two ways ex cellently discover 'd 3 namely, when Words C 4 ar 3"], [48, "( *4> are utter'd either on the ludden, or else m Passion ; therefore Tacitus does not impro^ perly call such Passions Tortures, because they urge Men to confess and betray their Se crets. Short Moral Precepts. THERE is commonly less Money, less Wisdom, and less good Faith, than. Men do account. It is in Life as it is in Ways, the shortest Way is commonly the foulest, and surely the. fairest Way is not much about. Do not always expect Occasions, but some times provoke them. The Bounds of Christian Community are set down, one Faith, one Baptism, and not one Rite, one Opinion. Amongst the Qualities that Princes do chiefly respect, and require of their Servants, Celerity and Alacrity in the dispatch of Bu ness, is above all the rest most acceptable, the Tongue Ipeaks to the Ear, but the Gesture, speaks to the Eye, &"], [49, "25 As it asks some Knowledge to ask a Que* siion not impertinent, so it requires some Understanding to make a Wish not absurd. Very generous and noble Dispositions are very rare. The Laws of Friendship ought to be devoutly kept. To give wholesome Council is a Task most; difficult. A forward Retention of Customs is as tur bulent a Thing as Innovation. Constancy is the Foundation of Virtue.' That is not seasonable Wisdom, which is. not quick and nimble. That Mind languishes, which is not some times spirited by Excess. To abstarn and to sustain, are Virtues pro\u00ab ceeding commonly from the fame Habit. Brevity is next to Silence.

Those Councils to which Time was not called, Time will not ratify. The Guilt of Ingratitude is nothing else but a too precise Consideration and Inquisition into the Cause of a Benefit conferr'd ; it is not to be expressed by Punishments, for it is a Crime that must be referr'd over to the Furies. Nothing but Fear is terrible ; there is no, thing solid in Pleasure, or assur'd in Virtue, where Fear disquiets. He that is flexible comes nearest to the Nature of Gold. I like the Man that is plyant to anothers Inclination, but yet re serves his Judgment from Flattery. Silence is the Fermentation of our Thoughts; it adds Grace and Authority to our Words, and like a kindly Sleep, refreshes Wisdom, and settles the Judgment. To put off the Importance of Business with a Jest, is a base slight of Wit 3 and to put; a Jest as a Matter of Moment upon serious Things is Childish Levity. He that does a Wrong, is the beginner of a Quarrel, but he that retalliates, takes away"], [51, "27 away all Means of ending it. Contend not with a Person that has some Heart and no Brain, a witless, wilful, worthless Mortal \u2022 for to overcome is no Victory, but to be con! quer'd by him a foul Disgrace. A little Folly in a very wise Man,and a small Offence in a very honest Man, and a slight Indecency of Manners in a Man of courtly and elegant Behaviour, much derogates from their Fame and Reputation. He that comes to seek after Knowledge with a Mind to scorn and censure, shall be sure to find Matter for his Humour, but no Matter for his Instruction. The Nature of every Thing is ieen in its smallest Portions ; it often comes to pass, that small and mean Things conduce more to the discovery of great Matters, than great Things to the discovery of small Matters | for Instance, We fee that Secret of Nature, (esteem'd one of the great Mysteries) of the turning of Iron rouch'd with the Loadstone towards the Poles, was found out in Needles of Iron, not in Bars of Iron. He that keeps not a De corum in smaller Matters, and in his daily Customs, though he be a great Man, yet set it down for Truth, that such a Person as that is wife but at certain Seasons. In the Diaries pf Alexander the Great, such small Particula- rities"], [52, "28 rities were contain'd, that if he chanc'd but to sleep at the Table, it was register'd. In governing, if there be Care and Provi dence taken, all goes on cheerfully, and with a willing Alacrity, without Noise or Tumult; but if these Forecasts be wanting when some greater Occasions unexpectedly fall out, all Matters throng in to be difpatch'd at once, and the whole Place rings of the Noise. It is better to be Servant to a Man whose Jealousies have no End, than to a Man whose Credulity has no mean. For there is no Safety with any one into whose Head all Things are convey'd as it were by Infusion and Direction from others. A bare and simple Defence, though it be just and more weighty, hardly compensates the Prejudice of the first Information, or is of Force of itself to reduce the Scales of Ju stice, once sway'd down to an equal Weight; Great Souls are to be carrefs'd with more than ordinary Affection in their Adverse For tunes. It is no wonder if they take to Heart a cold and contemptuous Behaviour from those to whom they have been serviceable. The Influence of Education is forcible, as that of our Birth; and the Habits that are rooted in us in our tender Years, are harder to"], [53, "29 to be displanted than the inherent Infections of our Blood. This is signified by the Arabian Proverb, which fays, The Tutors ofFouth have an Ascendent over their Stars. Suffer not your Rational Faculties to fall Asleep, while your Passions are active aad vigorous in working your Ruine ; let nothing corrupt your Integrity, but engrave on your Forehead this Motto, Prepared to Suffer. Our Memories are frail and treacherous, and we think many excellent Things, which for want of making a deep Impression, we can never recover afterwards ; in vain we hunt for thestragling Ideas, and rummage all the Solitudes and Retirements of our Souls, for a lost Thought which has left no Foot steps behind it. The swift Offspring of the Mind is gone, 'tis dead as soon as born, nay, often proves abortive in the Moment it was conceiv'd ; the only way therefore to retain our Thoughts, is to chain them in Words, and fasten them in Writing. A"], [54, "( io ) A few Paffages of two mofi an* cient and mrfi eminent Fathers of the Church, and Martyrs of Christ'/ Religion, St. Cy prian- and St. Ignatius. ST.

And is that then thy Resolution ; said the Pro consul, That Resolution, (reply 'd the Martyr) which is founded in God, cannot be alter d ; he was Zealous for the Churches Vnity, and against all Schism end Separation, as you may fee in his Epistle to Cornelius, Bishop of Rome. ' If ' it be so, (my dearest Brothers that the * Boldness of evil Men is to be fear'd, and * that which wicked Persons are not able to * compass by Right and Equity, they wist * effect by Rashness and Despair ; the force * of Episcopacy, and the sublime divine Power * of the Churches Government is lost; neither * can we continue Christians any longer, if it * comes to this, that we must be afraid of < the Threatnings and Snares of profligate * Wretches. This he said concerning two turbulent Presbyters disturbing the Churches Peace. The like fervent Zeal for the Superiority of Bishops above Presbyters, and against Schism, may be seen in divers of his Epistles ; and particularly upon that Promise or our Savi our, Matth. 18. 20. Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them. ' How can they be met * together in the Name of Christ (says he) ' who it is manifest are separated from Christ ' and his Church ? For when Heresies and * Schisms are sprung up, while they make con-"], [56, "( l\u00bb 1 ' constitute, and appoint divers different and c separate Conventicles for themselves, they * have forsaken the Head or Fountain of ' Truth. In making this most gracious Pro- ' mife, it cou'd not be our Lord's Intention ' to divide Men from his Church, which he ' himself both made and instituted, evert ' purchasing it with his own Blood ; but he c rather upbraiding the Discord of the Per- ' sidious, and commending Peace and Unity ' to the Faithful with his own Mouth, plain- * ly shews, that he will rather be with two * or three unanimous in Prayer, than with * the Multitudes of them that depart, or fe- ' parate themselves from them 3 and that * much more may be obtain'd of God by ' the agreeing Prayers of a few peaceable * Christians, than by the jarring Prayers of ' many who have divided themselves into ' Sides and Parties, and Factions. And upon another Occasion he fays, * The * grievous and inexpiable fault of Discord ' and Separation, cannot be purg'd away by * the most bitter Passion or Suffering ; nor 1 can he be a Martyr that is not in the 1 Church. He cannot come into the King * dom of God who forsakes the Church. St. Ignatim, who was a Disciple of the A postle St. John, says thus : * He that is with * in the Altar is pure; wherefore he is also * Obedient to the Biihop and Presbyter : Ye * ought, every one of you, to cherish your * Biihop. Let the Deacons obey their Priests, and"], [57, "33 * and the Priests their Bishop, and the Bishop * Christ, as Christ obeys the Father : For * Jesus Christ, our inseparable Lise, is the ' Mind of the Father, as the Bishops ap * pointed, even to the utmost Bounds of the * Earth, are the Mind of Jesus Christ ; wherefore it will become you to run to * gether, according to the Will of your Bi * shop ; as also ye do, for your famous Pres- byters worthy of God, is fitted as exactly 1 to the Bishop, as the Strings are to the * Harp. Therefore in your Concord and ' agreeing Charity, Jesus Christ is fung, and ' every single Person among you makes up ' the Chorus 5 that so, being all consonant ' in Love and Concord, and taking up the 1 Song of God, you may with one Voice, and e with a perfect Unity, sing to the Father of * Jesus Christ ; to the end, that by this Mind c he may both hear, yea, and perceive by 4 your Works, that ye are indeed Members * of his Son. Wherefore it is profitable for * you to live in an unblamable Unity, that * so you may always have a Fellowship with * God. How happy must I think you, who * are joyn'd to your Bishop as the Church 'to Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ to the \u00ab Father, that so all things may agree in the * fame Unity. Let no Man deceive himself; 6 if a Man be not within the Altar, he is 1 deprived of the Bread of God : For if the * Prayer of one or two be of such force, as 1 we are told, Matth. 18. 19. how much D * more"], [58, "( 54) 1 more powerful shall that of the Bishop and 4 the whole Church be. He therefore that * doth not come together in the same Place 4 with us is Proud, and has already con * dcmn'd himself; for it is written, God re 4 ssjleth tie Proud. Let us therefore take heed * that we do not set our selves against the Bi 4 shop, that we may be subject to God ; for 4 whomsoever the Master of the House sends * to his Houlhold, we ought, in like manner, * to receive him, as we wou'd receive him 4 that lent him. It is very evident, that we 6 ought to look upon the Bishop, even as we * wou'd upon the Lord Jesus Christ himself. 4 So long as there is no Contention or Strife 4 among you to trouble you, my Soul for * yours, ye must needs live according to the ' Will ofGod 3 where your Shepherd is, there * do you as Sheep follow after ; for there are * many Wolves who seem, worthy of Belief, * yet with a false and an evil Pleasure, lead 4 Captive those that run in the Course of 4 God 3 but in your Concord they shall find 4 no Place, Abstain, therefore, from those. 4 evil Herbs, which Jesus Christ does not * dress, because such are not the Plantation 4 of the Father ; for as many as are of Jesus * Christ, are also with their Bisliop ; and as 4 many as fliall with Repentance return in 4 to the Unity of the Church, even those * shall be Servants of God, that they may 4 live according to Jesus Christ : But if any * Man follow him that makes a Schism in * the"], [59, "( 35) the Church, he shall not inherit the King- dom of God 3 and if any one walk after any other Opinion, he agrees not with the Pas- sion of Christ. Wherefore let it be your 1 Endeavour to partake of the same Holy 4 Eucharist 3 for there is but one Flesli of 4 our Lord Jesus Christ, and one Cup unto 4 the Unity of his Blood 3 one Altar ; as also ' there is one Bishop, together with his Pres* * byters, and the Deacons their Fellow-Ser- 4 vants. Divers other Passages to the fame purpose there are in those admirable Epistles of this glorious Martyr and Servant of God, and a bundance of the fame Nature in the Writing of other Holy Fathers and Martyrs of the Pri mitive Church 5 but either these will awaken well meaning People, who unadvisedly ensnare themselves in Schisms, Separations and Divi sions, from the Orthodox Church we live in, to a more serious Consideration of their Er ror, Sin and Danger, or there will be small Hopes of other Authorities doing it, though a whole Volume sliould be filPd with them. This blessed St. Ignatius was the second Bi shop oi Antioch after St. Peter 3 he presided over that Church almost forty Years, where by it is next to certain, that he convers'd with some ot the Apostles, besides St.Jobn, whose Disciple he was. He was first cast into Prison for boldly asserting the Christian Religion,' where, for the Constancy and Resolution of his Profession, he suffer'd the most mercilels C 2 Torments"], [60, "36 Torments ; for he was whipt with Scourges, haying Bullets of Lead at their Ends ; was fore'd to hold Fire in his Hands, while his Sides were burn'd with Papers dipt in Oyl, his Feet set upon live Coals, and his Flesh torn off with burning Pincers ; all which Cruelties he overcame with invincible Pati. ence. At length the Emperor Trajan pro noune'd the fatal Sentence upon him, that he should be carried bound by Soldiers to Rome, and there be thrown to wild Beasts for a Prey. At which the Holy Martyr rejoye'd, faying, I thank thee, O Lord, that thou hast conde scended thus perfectly to honour me with thy Love, and hast thought me worthy with thy Apostle Paul to be bound with Iron Chains, which he imbrae'd chearfully, and praying fervently for his Church, which, with Tears, he commended to the Divine Grace and Pro vidence, he deliver'd up himself into the Hands of his Keepers, who were appointed to transport him that long and tedious Jour ney, to the Place of Execution.

After Dinner I may take a Turn about the House now and then, or some ho nest Recreation, such as my Director of my Conscience shall allow of. XVIII. I will diligently avoid all Sloth and Idleness, which is very hurtful to all, especially to such as are brought up in Ease and Plea sure. XIX. My Work in the Day shall be of some thing for the Beauty and Ornament of God's House, and Service of the Altar, and after a while to the reading of the holy Scripture a gain, wherein I was infinitely delighted, and found such delicious Sweets, before 1 was married.

In reproving others, I will take Care I be not transported by Choler to Wrath, using hard Words or Reproachful, or doing any Thing misbecoming a Person of my Quality. These Things this noble Spirit, in conver sing with God, conceiv'd in her Mind, couch'd in Writing, carried in her Bosom, practised exactly, as those that knew her can testify, for which she is deservedly honour'd as the Glory of her Sex, the Ornament of her Age, and she is set forth as a Pattern for all, especially"], [72, "( 48 ) especially Persons of Quality, that desire to live Holily, and dye Happily.

A SPEECH of the Most Re- verend Father in God Wil- liam Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, spoken at his Death on the S chaff old on Tower Hill, fan. 10. 1644. Good People, THIS is an uncomfortable Time to preach in, yet I shall begin with a Text of Scripture, Heb. 12. 2. Let hj run with Patience that Race which it set before us, looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith, who for the Joy that was. set before him, endured the Cross, despising the Shame, and is set down at the Ri<>ht Hand of the Throne of God. 1 have been long in my Race, and how I have look'd to Jesus, the Author and Fi- wislier"], [73, "49 nisher of my Faith, he best knows ; I am now come to the end of my Race, and here I find the Cross, a Death of Shame, but the Shame must be despised, or no coming to the Right Hand of God : Jesus despised the Shame for me, and God forbid but I should despise the Shame tor him. I am going apace, (as you fee) towards the Red Sea, aad my Feet are now upon the very Brink of it ; an Argument, I hope, that God is bringing me into the Land of Promise, for that was the Way through which he led his People 3 but before they came to it, he instituted a Passover for them, a Lamb it was, but it must he eaten with sowr Herbs. I shall obey and labour to di gest the sowr Herbs, as well as the Lamb; and I shall remember it in the Lord's Passover* I shall not think of the Herbs, nor be angry with the Hand that gather'd them ; but look up only to him who instituted that, and go verns these 3 for Men can have no more Power over me than what is given them from Above. I am not in love with this Passage thro the Red Sea, for I have the Weaknesses and In firmities of Flefli and Blood plentifully in me, and I have prayed, with my Saviour, Vt tran stret Ca/ex ifte, that this Cup of Red Wine might pass from me; but if not, God's Will (not mine) be done ; and I shall most willing ly drink of this Cup as deep as he pleases, and enter into his Sea, yea, and pass through it in the Way that he shall lead me. Bac e"], [74, "50 But I would have it remember'd (Good People) that when God's Servants were in this boisterous Sea, and Aaron among them, the Egyptians, which persecuted them, and did in a manner drive them into that Sea,were drowned in the fame Waters, while they were in pursuit of them. I know my God, whom I serve, is able to deliver me from this Sea of Blood, as he was to deliver the three Children from the Furnace ; and I most hum bly thank my Saviour for it, my Resolution is now, as theirs was then ; they would not worship the Image the King had set up, nor will I the Imaginations the People are setting up ; nor will I forsake the Temple and the Truth of God, to follow the Bleating of Jero .foam's Calf in Dan and Bethel; and as for this People, they are at this Day miserably mis led, (God of his Mercy open their Eyes that they may see the right Way 3^ for at this Day the Blind lead the Blind, and ff they go on, both will certainly fall into the Ditch. I am sand I acknowledge in all Humility) a most grievous Sinner many ways, by Thought, Word and Deed, and I cannot doubt, but that God has Mercy in Store for me a poor Penitent, as well as for other Sin ners. I have now, upon this fad Occasi on, ranfack'd every corner of my Heart, and yet I thank God, I have not fouud, among the many, any one Sin which deserves Death by any known Law of this Kingdom. And yet hereby I charge nothing upon my Judges ; for if"], [75, "51 if they proceed upon Proof (by valuable Wit nesses) I, or any other innocent Person, may be justly condemn'd ; and I thank God, though the Weight of the Sentence lies heavy upon me, I am as Quiet within as ever I was in my Life ; and though I am not only the first Archbishop, but the first Man, that ever died by an Ordinance of Parliament ; yet some of my Predecessors have gone this Way, tho' not by these means, fovElphagus was hurried away, and lost his Head by the Danes, and Simon Sadbary, in the Fury of Wat Tyler, and his Fellows; before these, St. John Baptist had his Head dane'd off by a lewd Woman, and St. Cyprian, Archbishop of Carthage, sub mitted his Head to a Persecuting Sword. Many Examples fgreat and good) and they teach me Patience; for I hope my Cause in Heaven will look of another Dye than the Colour that is upon it here 3 and some Com fort it is to me, not only that I go the way of those great Men in their several Generations, but also that my Charge (as foul as it is made) looks like that of the Jews against St. Paul, Acts 25. 5. For he was accused for the Law and the Temple; that is, Religion. And like that of St.' Stephen, Acts 6. 14. For breaking the Ordinances which Moses gave ; that is, Law and Religion, the Holy Place and iheFe?nple, (Verse 13.) But you will say, Do I then compare myself with the Integrity of St. Paul and St. Stephen ? No, far be that from me. I only raise a Comfort to my self, that these -Saints E 2 and"], [76, "( J* ) and Servants of God were laid at in their Times, as I am now 3 and 'tis memorable, that St. Pan1, who help'd on this Accusation against St. Stephen, did after fall under the very same himself. Yea, but here's a great Cla mour that I would have brought in Popery, I shall answer that more fully by and by; in the mean time you know what the Pharisees laid against Christ himself, If we let him alone, all Men will believe; in him, & venient Ro- mans, and the Romans will come, and take away both our Place and Nation. Here was a causeless Cry against Christ, that the Romans will come 3 and see how just the Judgment of God was, they crucified Christ for fear least the Romans should comej and his Death was it which brought in the Romans upon them ; God punisliing them with that they most fear'd, And I pray God this Clamour of \u2022v'eni Rotnani , of which I have given no Cause, help not to bring them in ; for the Pope never had such an Harvest in England, since the Reformation, as he has now upon the Sects and Divisions that are amongst us. In the mean time by Honour and Dishonour, by good Report and evil Report, as a De- ceiver, and yet True, am I passing through this World, 2 Cor. 6. And first this I shall be bold to speak of, the King our Gracious Sovereign has been much traducd also for :ging in of Popery, but on my Conscience (of which I shall give a very present Account,) I know him to be as free from this Charge, as"], [77, "53 as any Man living; and I hold him to be as sound a Protestant ('according to the Religion by Law Established J as any Man in this Kingdom, and that he will venture his Life as far and as freely for it. I think I do, or should know both his Affection to Religion, and Grounds for it, as fully as any Man in England. The second Particular is concerning this great and popular City, (which God bless). Here has been of late a Fashion taken up to gather Hands, and then go to the great Court of this Kingdom, (the Parliament) and Cla- mour for Justice, as if that great and wise Court, before whom the Causes come (which are unknown to the many.) could not, or would not do Justice, but at their Appoint \u2022ment. A way which may endanger many an innocent Man, and pluck his Blood upon their own Heads, and perhaps upon the Ci- ty's also. And this has been lately practised against my self; the Magistrates standing still and suffering them openly to proceed from Parish to Parish without Check. God forgive the Setters of this, with all my Heart I beg it, but many well meaning People are caught by it. In St.Stephen's Case, when nothing else would serve, they stirr'd up the People against him 3 and Herod went the fame way when he had kill'd St. James, yet he would not venture upon St. Peter, till he found how the other pleas'd the People. But take heed of having your Hands full of Blood, for there is E 3 a"], [78, "54 a time (\"best known to himself ) when God ( above other Sins ) makes Inquisition for Blood, and when that Inquisition is on foot, the Psalmist tells us, that God remembers, (bat that's not all) he remembers and forgets not the Complaint of the Poor, that is, whose Blood is siied by Oppression, V&f. 9. Take heed of this, 'tis a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God, but then espe cially, when he is making Inquisition for Bbod ; and (with my Prayers to avert it)I do heartily desire this City to remember the Pro phecy that is expressed, Jer. 56. 15. The third Particular is, the poor Church of En o I and. It has flourish 'd and been a Shel- o ter to other Neighbouring Churches, when Storms have driven upon them 3 but alas, now 'tis in a Storm it self, and God only knows whether, or how it shall get out ; and (\"which is, worse than a Storm from without,) its be come like an Oak cleft to Shivers, with Wed ges made out of its own Body, and at every Cleft, Propbaneness and Irreligion is entring in. While, as Prosper speaks in his second Book, De Vite contemptu, Cap. 4. Men that introduce Prophanenefs are cloak'd over with the Name Religionis Imaginare, of Imaginary Religion 5 for we have lost the Substance, and dwell too much in Opinion, and that Church, which all the Jesuit's Machinations could not ruin, is fallen into Danger by her own. The"], [79, "55 The last Particular (for I am not willing to be too long) is my self. I was born and baptiz'd in the Bosom of the Church of Eng land Established by Law, in that Profession I have ever since liv'd, and in that Profession I come now to dye. This is no time to dissem ble with God, least of all in Matters of Reli on, and therefore I desire it may be remem bred I have always liv'd in the Protestant Religion Establish 'd in England, and in that I come now to dye. What Clamours and Slanders I have endur'd for labouring to keep an Uniformity in the external Service of God, according to the Doctrine and Discipline of this Church, all Men know, and I have a bundantly felt. Now at last I am accus'd of High Treason in Parliament, a Crime which my Soul ever abhorr'd. This Treason was charg'd to consist of these two Parts, an En deavour to subvert the Laws of the Land, and a like Endeavour to overthrow the Protestant Religion Establifh'd by Law 3 besides my An swers to the several Charges, I protested my Innocency in both Houses. It was said, Pri soners Protestations at the Bar must not be taken. I can bring no Witness of my Heart, and the Intention thereof, therefore I must come to my Protestation, not at the Bar, but my Protestation at this Hour and Instant of my Death ; in which I hope all Men will be such charitable Christians, as not to think I would lye and dissemble, being instantly to give God an Account for the Truth of it. I E .4 L &"], [80, "( iO do therefore, in the Presence of God and his holy Angels, take it upon my Death, that I never endeavour'd the Subversion either of Law or Religion. And I desire you all to re- member this Protest of mine for my Inno- cency in these, and from all Treasons what- soever. I have been accus'd likewise as an Enemy to Parliaments ; No, I understand them and the Benefit that comes by them too well to be so ; but I did dislike the Mis- governments of some Parliaments many ways, and I had good Reason for it, for Corruptio optimi efipcffima, there is no Corruption in the World so bad, as that which is of the best Thing in itself ; for the better the Thing is in Nature, the worse it is corrupted, and that being the highest Court, over which no other has Jurisdiction, when 'tis mis-inform'd or mis-govern'd, the Subject is left without all Remedy, but I have done. I forgive all the World, all and every of those bitter Enemies which have persecuted me, and humbly de- lire to be forgiven of God first, and then of every Man, whether I have offended him or not, if he do but conceive, that I have. Lord do thou forgive me, and I beg Forgiveness of him, and lb I desire you to join in Prater vith me. From"], [81, "57 From the British Apollo on Absence. THAT Absence sometimes encreascs Love, at other times destroys it, may happen from the Circumstances of Parting. When the Separation is attended with no shocking Reflection, when no ill Usage or Infidelity has been the cause of it, Absence certainly encreascs Love, because the Re membrance of past Pleasure entertains the Soul, with nothing but the Sentiments of an endearing Tenderness : But if the Separation proceeds from want of Merits defect of Love, or good Manners, the Mind employs itself in the comtem plating of those Idea's, which seem most reasonable to restore its Tranqui lity, and with a verv little trouble gets the better of that Passion, which has had the Misfortune to be plac'd on an unworthy Object. A Question sent to the British Apollo. GA N any thing be more disagreeable in Conversation, than what we call half a Man and half a Boy ? Answer"], [82, "58 Answer from ffo British Apollo \u2022T^HE Question admits of a very consi- derable Distinction ; for where a Youth is under the agreeable Restraint of Modesty, there none will charge his Conversation with Impertinence, but pragmatical and conceited Men, who think it unmans them to conde scend at any time to the Society of a Strip ling, and look upon his Discourse as below their Notice ; and yet many of such con ceited Fellows gain no other Advantage from their riper Years, than to be mature in Ig norance, and confirmed in Dulnefs ; but ju dicious and modest Men think it sometimes not unworthy their Regard, to behold Na ture in her more airy Dress ; to view the* Gaiety of the blooming Spring ; to observe the Advances of ripening Reason 3 to con template, on the one hand, the Beauties, on the other, the Deficiencies of a growing In tellect, and trace the openings of the Under standing, while in its' Progress to Maturity. A juvenile Capacity may suggest many things, which, if utter'd by Persons more advanced in Years, wou'd be chargeabse with too much Levity, and thence occasion a Dislike, which yet may be agreeable and diverting, as com- ing from suitable, from proper Persons. The Defects which naturally attend the Discourse ' - \" cf"], [83, "59 of an unexperienc'd Youth, receivs some A batement and Allay, in as much as it presents the Company with something entirely new and different from that of Men ; and there fore is Productive of that Variety, with which Humane Nature is so exrreamly taken. But where a Youth has neither Modesty for his Guide, nor Discretion for his Tutor, the whole Stage of the World can scarce af ford us a more disagreeable and ungrateful Object. He is Affectation in its very Essence, while he awkardly endeavours to conceal the Boy and ape the Man ; and therefore this Boy- Man is a greater Monster than Horace's Pi cture made up of such Heterogeneous Parts. The flafhiness of his Discourse, while ill suited to the misbecoming Gravity of Man hood, has nothing to recommend it so much as to our bearance. The crude indigested Matter so frequently vented by those of greener Years, receive their whole Excuse from the modest Diffidence of the Speaker 3 but to be positive, and yet insignificant ; pert, and yet frivolous ; dogmatical, and yet im pertinent, we may challenge the World for an odder Mixture. Mr,"], [84, "60 Mr. Cowley's Character, hy Bijhop Sprat. IN his Esteem of other Men, he constant- ly prefer'd the good Temper of their Minds, and Honesty of their Actions, above all the Excellencies of their Eloquence or Knowledge. He had a perfect natural Good ness, which neither the uncertainty of his Condition, nor the largeness of his Wit could pervert : He had a Firmness and Strength of Mind, that was of Proof even against the Art of Poetry itself; nothing Vain or Fantastical, nothing Flattering or Insolent appear'd in his Humour to the last ; the Truth of his Heart was above the Corruption of ill Examples, and the sighc of them confirm'd him in the contrary Virtues. There was nothing affect ed or singular in his Habit, or Person, or Gesture : He understood all the Forms of good Breeding enough to practise them, with out burdening himself, or others : He never oppressed any Man's Parrs, nor never put any Man out of Countenance : He never had any Emulation for Fame, or Contention for Pro fit with any Man. When he was in Busi neis, he suffer'd others Importunities with much easiness ; when he was out of it, he was never importunate himself. His MoJe sty and Humility were lo great, that if he had"], [85, "61 had not had many other equal Virtues, they might have been thought Dissimulation. His Conversation was certainly of the most ex- cellent kind 3 for it was such as was rather admir'd by his familiar Friends than by Stran- gers at first Sight : He surprized no Man at first with any thing extraordinary : He never thrust himself violently into the good Opinion of his Company ; he was content to be known by leisure, and by degrees, and so the Esteem which was conceiv'd of him was better grounded, and more lasting. In his Speech, neither the Pleasantness excluded Gravity, nor was the Sobriety of it incon- sistent with Delight. No Man parted wil- lingly from his Discourse ; for he so order'd it, that every Man was satisfied that he had his Share. He govern'd his Passions with great Moderation : His Virtues was never troublesome or uneasy to any. Whatever he disliked in others, he only corrected it, by the silent Reproof of a better Practice. His Wit was so temper'd, that no Man had ever Reason to wish it had been less : He prevent- ed other Men's Severity upon it by his own: He never willingly recited any of his Wri- tings ; none but his intimate Friends ever discover'd he was a great Poet by his Dis course. His Learning was large and pro found, well composed of all Ancient and Modern Knowledge ; but it sat exceeding close and handsomely upon him : It wras not imboss'd on his Mind, but enamell'd. He never"], [86, "( 6i ) never guided his Life by Whispers, or Opi nions of the World ; yet he had a great Re verence for a good Reputation. He hearken'd to Fame when it was a just Cenfurer ; but not when an extravagant Babbler. He was a passionate Lover of Liberty, and Freedom from Restraint, both in Actions and Words ; but what Honesty others receive from the Directions of, Laws, he had by native Incli nation ; and he was not beholden to others Wills, but to his own for his Innocence. He perform'd all his Natural and Civil Duties, with admirable Tenderness : His Thoughts were never above nor below his Condition : He never made his present Life uncomforta ble, by undue Expectations of future Things. Whatever Disappointments he met with, they only made him understand Fortune better, not repine at her the more. He was accom plisiYd with all manner of Abilities for the greatest Business, if he wou'd but have thought so of himself. He had a Mind that practised the greatest of Virtues it self, and a Wit that was best able to recommend them to others His Friendships were inviolable , the fame Men with whom he was familiar in -his Youth, were his nearest Acquaintance at the Day ofhis Death. If the private Course of his last Years made him contract his Conver- sation to a few, yet he only withdrew, not broke off from any of the others. His last and principal Design, was that which ought to be the principal Design of every wise Man, 'VIZ."], [87, "63 viz. the establishing his Mind in the Faith he profefs'd. He was in his Practise, exact ly obedient to the Use and Precepts of our Church 3 nor was he inclined to any Uncer tainty and Doubt, as abhorring all Conten tion in indifferent Things, and much more in Sacred. The Char after of Archbishop Laud, from the Lord Cla- rendon; HE was a Man of great Parts, and very exemplary Virtues, and sure never any Man was better fupply'd with Innocency of Heart, and Integrity of Manners ; he was a Man of great Courage and Resolution, Pious and Just in all his Actions, and entire to the King, the Church, and his Country ; but he had a hasty sharp way of expressing himself, and courted Persons too little, nor cared to make his Designs and Purposes appear as candid as they were, by shewing them in any other Dress than in their own Natural Beauty, though perhaps in too rough a manner : He apply'd the Discipline of the Church to great and splendid Trangressors, as well as to mean Offenders; if the Faults and Vices were fit to be look'd into, and discover'd, let the Persons be who they would that were guilty of them, they"], [88, "( <54) they were sure to find no connivance of Fa vour from him. The sharpness of his Language and Ex pressions was so Natural to him, that he could not debate any Thing without some Commotion, when the Argument was not of any Moment ; nor bear any Contradiction in Debate, even in the Council, where all Men are equally free, with that Patience and Temper that was necessary ; of which, they \u25a0who wish'd him not well, took many Ad vantages, and would therefore contradict him, that he might be transported with some inci dent Passion, which, upon a short Reflection, he was always sorry for, and most readily and Willingly would make Acknowledgment. Something of the Lord Falk- land5/ Character, \"\"HE Lord Falkland was a Man wonder- JL belov'd by all who knew him 3 of a Wit so sharp, and a Nature so sincere, that nothing could be more lovely ; he was ib severe an Adorer of Truth, that he could as easily give himselfleave to steal as to dissem ble, or to suffer any Man to think that he would do any Thing which he resolv'd not to do, which he thought a more mischievous kind ot Lying, than a positive averring, wh&t could be most easily contradicted. A"], [89, "65 A Character of the Clergy in the Reign of King Charles I. from the Lord Clarendon.

His Representations of Vir tue and Vice, were not more lively in his Books, than in his Life ; his Fancy was not above his Virtue ; his Humours, Councils and Actions, were renown'd in the Ro mancer, and Heroick in the Statesman ; his Soul was as large as his Parents, the Modesty of the Mother allaying the Activity of the Father 3 a Man so sweetly Grave, so familiarly Stay'd, so prettily Serious, he was above his Years ; Wisdom gain'd by Travel ; Experi ence gain'd from Observations, solid and use ful Learning drawn from knowing Languet, his three Years Companion, and choicest Books, accomplifh'd him for the Love of all, and the Reverence of most ; his infant Dis- courses teach Men, Oh what had his riper Years done !

WHEN the French speak of Gastavus Adolphus, they cannot restrain their Words on this side a Panegyrick ; they fay he was a Prince above Praise. 'Tis certain his very Enemies admire his unimitable Courage, and matchless Fortune ; in his Face was a most agreeable Mixture of Majesty and Be nignity, creating Respect and Love at the lame time in the Beholders. He was so fa miliar with every one, as if he had forgot himself : As well as he was a Stranger to Pride, he was a great Student in his Youth, and made himself Master of Latin, French and Italian, being also perfectly skill'd in an cient and modern Histories. He had a wonderful Faculty in discevering Impostures, a dexterous Wit in Time of Dan. ger and Difficulty, being ready at Counsel, and swift in Execution, and as cunning at a Stratagem, as he was bold at an Onset. He was liberal to his Officers, and to all Men of Merit, but a severe Punisher of Disorders in his Army.

His manner of Speaking, and of acting, was perfectly the fame; for alt ho' it had not much of Ornament, nor Artifice, yet there was in it great Weight of Sense; it was strong and sententious, much after the way of Thucydtdes. Ca'.o was carried, as it were, by a kind of Inspiration, to im brace every Virtue ; but most inclin'd to delight in a sort of steady Justice, that was not to be wrought upon by Favour or Compassion. His Speech had no thing in it childish or affected, but was rough, vehement, and full of Sense ; and he had something ot ' Mirth and Raillery mingled with the Gravity of his Temper, which was not unpleasant. Ar at us had a generous Soul, and a strong Passion for great Exploits, - Ariaf'ves excell'd Ochus in Gentleness, Plain dealing, and good Nature.

Let us learn the Rules of Piety and Justice from them all, and be always of an even Deportment, pursuing all M-iti writh Civilities and good Offices. On Friend ihip,/ro;^ Dr .Taylor TH E Word Friend is of a large Sig- nification, and means all Relations and Societies that is not Enemy 3 but by Friendships may also be meant the greatest Love, and the greatest Usefulness, and the most open Communication, and the noblest Sufferings, and the most exemplary Faithful ness, and the severest Truth, and the greatest Union of Minds, of which brave Men and Women are capable : But this is as well Cha rity as Friendship, and is authoriz'd to extend to all Mankind 3 and the more we love the better we are, and the greater our Friend ships are, the dearer we are to God, Let 'em be as dear, and let 'em be as perfect, and let 'em be as many as you can, there is no Danger in it 3 only where the Restraint be- gins,"], [134, "( iio ) gins, there begins our Imperfection. It is not ill that you entertain brave Friendships and worthy Societies, it were well if you could love, and if you could benefit all Mankind ; for I conceive that That is the Sum of all Friendship. Friendships are no thing but Love and Society mixt together, that is, a conversing with them whom we love ; but our Friendships may admit Variety, as does our Conversation. A good Man will love where he is belov'd, and that's the first Tye of Friendship : That was the Commen dation of the bravest Friendship in Theocritus. They lov'd each other with a Love, That did in all Things equal prove. I like the Gentiles Litany well. Let God give Friends to me for my Rewards Who shall my Love with equal Love Regard' For it is impossible this Nearness of Friend ship can be where there is not mutual Love; but he only is fit to be chosen for a Friend, who can give me Counsel, or defend my Cause, or guide me right, or can and will, when I need it, do me good 3 only this I add, into the heaps of doing good I will reckon loving me. As to the Measures of Friendship, they may be as great as you can express ; beyond Death it cannot go, to Death it may. David and Jonathan lov'd at a strange Rate ; but hear the Expressions. Jonathan"], [135, "( \u25a0\u00bb) Jonathan watch'd for David's Good, told him of his Danger, and help'd him to escape ; took part with David's Innocence against his Father's Malice and Injustice, and beyond all this, did it to his own Prejudice. Humility and Charity are the two greatest Graces in the World, and these are the greatest Ingredients which constitute Friendship and express it ; but yet there is a Limit even to Friendship, it must be as great as our Friend fairly needs, in all things where we are not ty'd up by a former Duty, to God, our selves, or some pre- obliging Relative : But no Friendstiip can excuse a Sin ; the Duty and Love to Parents must not yield to Religion, much less to any new Friendship : Our Parents are to be pre fer'd before the Corban, and are at no hand to be laid aside, but when they engage against God ; nor can it be reasonable or just, prudent or lawful, for a Friend to be more than Hus band and Wife ; for Marriage is the Qu\u00a7en of Friendships, in which there is a Commu nication of all that can be communicated by Friendship ; and it being made Sacred by Vows and Love, by Bodies and Souls, by In terest and Custom, by common Fortunes and common Councils, it is the Principal in the kind of Friendship, and the Measure of all the rest ; a Man must leave Father and Mo ther and cleave to his Wife 3 that is, the dearest thing in Nature is not comparable to the dearest thing in Friendship ; and I think this is Argument sufficient to prove Friend- ship"], [136, "( 111 ) ship to be the greatest Bond in the World. But there is not in the World a perfect Cause of perfect Friendship. But whatsoever can be spoken of Love, which is God's Eldest Daughter, can be said of Virtuous Friend ship. Friends are to Friends as leffer Gods, while they Honour and Service to each other pay. And Friendship requires every thing that can be honest and prudent- useful and neces sary ; but I wou'd not in Bravery visit my Friend when he is Sick of the Plague, unleis I can do him good, at least equal to my Dan ger ; but I will procure him Physicians, and Prayers, all the Assistances that he can re ceive, and all that he can desire, if they be in my Power ; and when lie is dead, I will not run into his Grave, and be stifled with his Earth ; but I will mourn for him, and perform his Will, and take care of his Rela tives, and do for him as if he were alive. He that is a Friend after Death, hopes not for a Recompencc from his Friend : Of such immortal, ablfracted pure Friendships indeed there is no great plenty, the Dead and the Absent have but few Friends ; but while my Friend lives, I may please my self in his So- ciety, and in this there is no Exception, un- less the Friendship be between Persons of a different Sex ; for then not only the Interest of their Religion, and the Care of their Ho* nour,"], [137, "( \u00abM ) nour, but the Worthiness of their Friendship requires that their Intercourse be prudent,and free from Suspicion and Reproach. Never accuse your Friend, nor believe him that does 3 if you do, you have broken the Skin : But he that is angry with every little fault, breaks the Bones of Friendslssp. Do not think you did contract Alliance with an Angel, when you rook your Friend into your Bosom ; he may be Weak as well as you are, and you may need Pardon as well as he ; That Man loves Flattery more than Friend ship, who would not only have his Friend, but all the Contingencies of his Friend to humour him, Give your Friend Counsel wisely and charitably, but leave him to his Liberty, whether he will follow you or not, and be not angry if your Counsel be rejected; for Advice is no Umpire, and he is not my Friend who will be my Judge whether J. will or not : He that gives Advice to his Friend, and exacts Obedience to it, does not the Kindness and Ingenuity of a Friend, but the Office and Pertness of a School- master. Never Comport your self so as that your Friend can be afraid of you ; perfect Love casteth cut Fear: That Friendship is Ty ranny where Equality is chang'd into Em pire, and Society into Obedience.

IT is Worth and Bravery, and good Hu- mour, which engages one Virtuous Per son to another: These Qualities excite Admi ration, and Admiration improves into Love, and Love proceeds into Intimacy and Union.' A Friend must use Freedom without Rough ness, and oblige without Design. Cowardice will betray Friendship, and Covetousness will starve it ; Folly will be nauseous, and Passion is apt to ruffle, and Pride will sty out into Con-"], [139, "115 Contumely and Neglect. Pride is so unso ciable a Vice, and does all things with so ill a Grace, that there is no closing with it : A Proud Man will be sure to Challenge more than belongs to him ; you must expect him Stiff in his Conversation, Fulsome in com mending himself, and bitter in his Reproofs : Tis well it his Favours are not turn'd into Injury and Affront ; spoiPd either by the contemptuous way of doing, or by upbraid ing after they are done. Such Behaviour as this frights away Friendship, and makes in stand off in Dislike and Aversion. Friend ship, tho' not Nice and Exceptious, yet must not be rudely treated, nor used with Distance or Disdain. Friendship, to make it true, must have Beauty as well as Strength 3 Charms to endear, as well as Power to supply. An inoffensive Pleasantness is another good Qua lity for the fame purpose, and he that can Cure by Recreation, and make Pleasure the Vehicle of Health, is a Doctor in good earnest. A Man is oblig'd to serve his Friend as far as Opportunity, Discretion, and former Pre ingagements will give leave 3 to break upon the score of Danger, or Expence, is to be mean and narrow spirited, provided always the Assistance may be given without undoing a Man, or prejudice to a third Person 5 or without Violations of Conscience, or Honour.

Death did not rudely snatch him from your full Hopes of many Years to come, but gently drew him from your Wishes. You have been exact in the Performance of your Duty to him, and you may consider, that as one Blessing is taken from you, so you have many left, which are not the less considerable for being common. The Cause of your Tears indeed is very great, and in a Soul so passionate and tender as yours, makes a very deep Impression ; but the more sharp it is, the greater Reason you have to withstand its Force : You must struggle and contend, and not easily yield your self a Prey to that Tyrant, Melaacholy. And then as you are a Christian, Patience under Sufferings, and Resignation to the Will of God, are as much Christian Duties as any other ; and as every Grace and every Duty has its proper Season, so you fhou'd now acquiesce in this Dispensation ; for we are well assur'd that all Events are the Product of God's unerring Providence.

However, as when one with a bad Voice and worse Skill is sup- posed"], [255, "231 posed to know how to sing, by a Company that won't be perswaded but he can, the best way is to give them one formidable Screech, that they may be satisfied, so I'll give you a small Specimen of my Doggrel 3 but it can- not be properly called mine, 'tis a Hash of Scraps pick'd out of a Heathen Author. The Occasion was this : I was one Day peevish with my ill Fortune, so that neither Com- pany nor any Book that J had would divert me. I ask'd a Friend that was near me for some Book of his ; he brought me Dry den's Virgil; Fom Thumb would have been as plea- sing 3 what had I to do with the Romantick Sorrow of Lovers and Heroes, that had so many true Ones of my own. I flung it away, walk'd musing about, with recourse to Re- medies beyond all worldly Applications ; but being a little in the Flutter, and not easily fix'd on abstracted Thoughts, I took up the Book again. I dipt, and found this Advice and Prayer, at least I am oblig'd to the Hea then for good Part of it. Endure and conquer, God will soon dispose To future Good thy past and present Woes.

A Prayer out of Virgil sounds oddly 3 but the Attempt of reforming the Heathens Words is, I think, no worse a Crime, than 'twou'd be to reform the Hea then were he now alive. By this we may see how much Good is to be learn'd out of Evil. I think it an Age since I saw my London Friends, a Happiness which I hope to enjoy next Month. I am, with mine and my Wise's hearty Service to Philaster, and all Friends, Tour most humble and most Obedient Servant, Bassillio: Pamella to Victoria. My dearest Niece, MY Grief is too great for a Secret ; but I know not whether my dear Orinda has heard of my present Affliction.

I hope I have a just and thankful"], [258, "234 thankful Sense of all my Obligations to Phi laster, and of my Happiness in such a dear and tender Friend as your sclf5 you ever was, and are as dear to me as my own Soul, and I know will act in all Things towards me and mine to the utmost of your Power. Your last Letter, amidst my Sorrow, gave me more Comfort than I am able to express. I read it to Emperia ; she commended it much, and said you was her Cousin. Dearest Niece, let me know the Result of all your Measures, as soon as possibly you can, and the Truth of all Things relating to the Comfort or Dis comfort of your most perplexed, but most passionate Lover and true Friend, Pamella. Gloriana to Victoria. AS to the remaining Part of those Letters of yours which are in my Hands, I de sire you wou'd think no more of them, but remember how unmerciful you have already been with them. I have so often repented I ever put them into your Power, that I am not to be prevailed with now by your Re quest, nor dar'd by your Demand, to part with them any more.

But that you may not think me inexorable, ill\u2014 natur'd, or unwilling to oblige you in any reasonable Thing, within my Power, I have found a Way whereby you may redeem them, viz. you shall burn all those Letters you have of mine, and you shall tear from your Book all that is copy'd from any thing of mine ; in short, before I deliver any of yours, I will be thoroughly satisfy 'd that there does not re main one Syllable of mine with you.

As to Daphne's Journey into the Country, I can be but an ill Judge of what Improvement slie may make there, because I know none of those Persons who are to have the Management of her. I can't but think she wou'd have been as much a Gainer in London as there, with those that have not an absolute Power over her : At her Age I think Persons are more to be influenced by Precept than by Example; and in my Mind both are perfectly necessary.

I am, without any reserve, Tour sincere constant Friend, Gloriana, Obio to Victoria. Dear Madam, I Must beg your favourable Censure of my Silence, till you know the Cause of it. Your pure Friendship wou'd make it crimi nal, was it occasion'd by a wilful Neglect. The next Day after I receiv'd your Letter, brought me my old Enemy the Gout, which depriv'd me of my Hands till this Time. I am, dear Madam, wonderfully pleased to read those Divine Aphorisms you was pleased to transcribe out of Seneca 5 who tho' a Heathen, was certainly infpir'd, and in many things a Practical Example to all Christians. \u2014 Both Philaster and you do me Justice in believing that"], [262, "238 that I retain a kind Remembrance of you 3 it is most certainly true, every Day (when in my melancholy Dumps) I find a peculiar Belief by entertaining my Thoughts with the Happiness I enjoy in the Acquaintance of you two ; which Experience tells me are my most sincere Friends 3 a Happiness I cannot find elsewhere, no, not in my own Relations : But must I be depriv'd in some Measure of what I reap such Advantage by, as one of the con siderable Pleasures of my Life 5 I mean Victo ria's charitable and obliging Letters, and on ly because she does not fancy her own Wri ting ?

I fee Love is a diffusive Thing, and like Patience, lies hid till Tryal comes. Your kinct Reprehension of me did not in the least dis oblige me, for I imputed it all to Love. There's nothing that you can write, or fay, or do, that can give me a Thought amiss of you : Nothing but an ill Intention to me, can need a Pardon from me ; as for all other Things, which may proceed from Er rour or, Mistake, assure your self; my charm ing Friend, they shall always meet a favour able Construction. Not that I think you. guilty of either, but so long as we are Hu mane, we must make the Supposition. I think your Expectations both just and rea sonable, and design no Reserve to you ; but I beg you never to impute any seeming Neg lect to a Want of the most friendly Love or tenderest Respect: For if frequent Think ing of you, and often wishing my self with you, be Love 3 if being always pleas'd when with"], [264, "( 240 ) with you, and leaving you with Reluctancy, be Love ; if having a Concern for your In terest, and sharing in your Joys and Griefs ; if taking a Pleasure in hearing you prais'd, and not bearing a Reflection to your Dis advantage, be Love ; if delighting to talk of you, and so approving of you, as to wish my felt like you, and to repose an entire Confi dence in you, be Love, then you may con clude I love you.

It must be consess'd there are some Dispositions so sordid, that the most conspi cuous Virtue can have no Influence upon them 3 but those as little merit the Title of Love as Friendship. I can't but observe, that notwithstanding the Affinity between Mrs Phillips and Mr Cowley, yet in his excellent Discourse on Friendship between David and Jtnathan, he has not made two Definitions of love and Friendship ; for what comes short of tse latter, he has branded with a far worse Name than that of Love.

It's Rules are infallible 3 for when any prove other wise, at that instant they cease to be Rules of Reason. Whereas if we depend on Ex perience we continually are deceiv'd. Such Remedies recover'd us from such a Disease ; we apply the same again on the like Account, and are destroy'd from a Change in our Con stitution. By such Methods such Persons rose in the World ; we take the fame, and are ruin'd from an Alteration in' the State of Affairs. Yesterday we were diverted by Mimickry, Puns, and such low kind of Wit ; we encounter the like to Day, when resign'd to more sublime Speculations, and they grow intollerable to us. The like Disappointments we shall meet, while we depend on Experi ence in all Circumstances of Life : Therefore we ought not once to depend thereon till we have first addrefs'd to Reason for her Con sent ; for at most, Experience is but the Hand maid of Reason, to offer Matters to her Ap probation or Rejection, before we enter upon 'em.

I don't fay this, because I am unwilling to engage any deeper with you ; no, that is far from me ; but I think you will gain but little by the Grant ; for when there is nothing left to cherish, maintain, and support an Affection, but the poor Remains of a Promise, I believe that will hardly be of Force enough to keep it from an utter Dissolution ; for I question whether it be in my Power to love, only because it is my Duty so to do. However, if a Promise may tend to your better Assurance, I do (as far as it is possible for me to know my own Mind) formally promise you, that I do now, and for the future must, shall, and will faith fully love you, as long as I am capable of retaining any Notion of Love and Friend ship- That I often fail in such Expressions of my Kindness, as you think necessary, may perhaps be imputed to the untuneablenefs of my Soul ; but I have no Design of any Re serve to you.

WHEN nine Years of my Days were spent In sweet Repose, and true Content, It was ordain'd by Heaven's Decree, My first Essay at Toil should be. My Father did a House provide, Where he advertiz'd did reside ; Distant from my Native Place, More than four Days Journey's space. When th'unwelcome Day appear'd, And all Conveniencies prepar'd, Our- Neighbours from the Town attend us, Praying Heaven to defend us ; Our"], [357, "( m ) Our Friends their Sorrow to express, Wept, as they wish'd us good Success, Thus, by Providence conducted, And a Parent's Care instructed, We our Journey did begin, And came safely to our Inn. Each Morning by the Break os Day, Our Guides did hurry us away, Which, to my In-experiency, Seem'd a barb rous Cruelty. Every Day I did complain, Both of Weariness and Pain ; Which my indulgent Mother hears, And can scarce refrain from Tears. Health and good Humour to repair, She no Cost, nor Pains did spare. Thus with tend'rest Care I rode To the Place of our Abode ; Where the courteous Strangers meet us, And with friendly Welcomes greet us; Each endeavouring to exceed, Their Neighbour's past officious Deed, And what their Kindness could invent, Was brought for our Divertiscment.

My Curt'sies, and my too quick Gate, She undertook to regulate, And when-soe'er I did amiss, She inform'd me with a Kiss.
