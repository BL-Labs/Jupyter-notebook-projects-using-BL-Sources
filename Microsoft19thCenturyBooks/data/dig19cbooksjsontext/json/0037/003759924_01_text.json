AS an admirer of the fine Arts, and as a well-wisher to those who possess that libe rality which ought to distinguish their profession, I have frequently had cause to regret the many disgraceful acts, which have too often thrown an obloquy upon the whole class of Picture Dealers. That there are men, who from the great attachment they hold to the works of illustrious Artists, seek after the finest Specimens of Genius, and who are endowed with sufficient know ledge, duly to appreciate merit, 1 can alledge from my oivn experience. Should these men carry on an honorable commerce,"], [8, "6 PREFACE. by placing genuine paintings in the collec tions of the curious, at a fair compensation for their trouble and skill, the admirers of the Art, nay the Nation itself, are in debted to them, for rescuing, perhaps from destruction, what must in every country, constitute a desirable ornament ; but when we see ignorance affecting science, and with a boundless effrontery, giving whatever names may best suit the nefarious purpose ; when we observe the signature of the real Artist effaced, that a false assertion may not evidently be contradicted ; when we hear prices demanded for the works, as arbitrary and ridiculous as the names that are given to them, we involuntarily suffer ourselves to lose our confidence, even in honesty, and to reduce the profession of a Picture Dealer to a degrading equality with many other traffics that have been long regarded with suspicion and contempt. For those few whose discernment enables them to see thro' impo."], [9, "PREFACE. 7 sition, the Impostor spreads his flimsy net in vain ; but too true it is, that the more unwary may, and do, fall into the toil, and that the spoil thus fraudulently obtained, encourages the deceiver in his base under takings, and, at the same time, throws an odium upon those whose actions have deser ved a better fate. I may probably be excused, as 1 am upon the subject, if I advise the possessors of paintings, to be cautious to whom they commit them to be cleaned and repaired. No doubt but there are meritorious Picture Cleaners, as well as hottest Picture Dealers, yet, that there exist Defacers of Paintings, as well as Dealers, who are a digrace to their profession, I am confident. The fine distance, the \u0153rial tint, and the finished glazing disappear before the rude touch of the Pretender.

In vain shall Poussin look for the retiring castle, which adorned the distant hill; an earthquake has overwhelmed it; and the glow- ing Campagna of Claude, reduced to a faint twilight, is dimly perceived thro' a dense mist of destroying varnish. Against such Goths, who would overrun the Empire of the Arts, a vigorous and spirited defence should be made, and the most effectual de fence, in my opinion, would be a deaf ear to their attestations, and a closed gate to themselves."], [11, "ARGUMENT.
