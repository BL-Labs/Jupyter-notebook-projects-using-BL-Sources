Lord Alan, as O'Brien had predicted, only delayed his journey to the North until Amy's scattered possessions were obtained from Leasowes and SAvanage. The interval, brief as it was, afforded scope for many fluctuations of humour, and if at one moment nothing could exceed the tenderness of his manner, at another it Avas clouded by gloom and suspi cion.

On the morning after the wedding, Amy said, doubtfully, that she Avished to write to her mother and to Eva. ' Do not look at me as if it Avere necessary to ask my permission,' said Alan : ' write by all means if you think fit, but, since much depends upon the view which may be taken of the facts connected with our marriage, you Avill allow me to look over your letters.' Such a stipulation did not diminish the irksomeness of the task, and Amy began by her letter to Mrs. Mertoun, Avhich seemed to her the easiest of composition. The words did not run fluently off her pen, and when at last she submitted the sheet to her husband's inspection, it was Avith the timidity Avith Avhich a schoolboy places an unsuccessful exercise before the eyes of his master \u2014 a timidity justified by the event, for Lord"], [11, "a bride's welcome. 3 Alan read it twice through with silence Avhich marked his disapprobation. ' Will it do, Alan ?' Amy said at last. ' I cannot say how it may do for Mrs. Mertoun. Such cold expressions of satisfac tion with the lot you have chosen can scarcely be gratifying to me.' ' If you wish me to say more, Alan,' ' Can I wish to dictate expressions of happiness Avhich are worthless unless they are spontaneous ? But on one point I have a right to dictate ; give me your pen.' And taking it from his wife's hand, Alan slurred with a heavy stroke through the name of Dennis O'Brien, which recurred twice in the short letter. ' Have I not told you, Amy, that this man, of whom you write so familiarly, must be to you as a stranger ? ' ' Mamma would think it unnatural if I did not call him by his christian name,' said Amy. B 2"], [12, "4 VANESSA. ' And I,' said Lord Alan haughtily, 'think it still more unnatural that you should dis regard the only order I have yet given you. \u2014 Is O'Brien's image so constantly present in you heart, that you must flaunt his insolent interference in the eyes of the world ? ' Amy took back her letter in silence, and made a fresh copy, in which any mention of O'Brien was omitted; and she asked her mother to believe that the great happiness of knoAving herself to be beloved by Alan had swept away all other considerations. This second draft was allowed by her husband to pass without comment ; yet its reception was not so encouraging as to dispose her to risk a fresh subject of irritation in the Avording of her explanation to Eva, and this other letter remained umvritten. Amy did not fully understand that the source of Lord Alan's vindictive animosity toAvards O'Brien Avas due to his intervention"], [13, "a bride's avelcome. 5 on her behalf, Avhich had left Alan no loop hole of escape from an unAvelcome and im prudent marriage. Such a marriage had formed no part of his profligate scheme of pleasure ; and Lady Cecilia, in her systematic depreciation of Amy, had led him to believe that the exertions by which Richard Mer toun had raised himself from obscurity to wealth had not affected the position of the other members of his family ; and that they still ranked among the smaller tradespeople of Allerton, so that, Avhatever indignation his conduct might excite there, would fail to pene trate the circle in Avhich he moved. Lord Alan's calculations had been overthrown by O'Brien's plain dealing rather than by Amy's personal efforts to break through his toils, and, indeed, the fatal facility Avith Avhich she had consented to risk her good name at his bidding left a profound distrust of her future conduct to rankle in his breast."], [14, "6 VANESSA. Since the bond which united them was indis soluble, he conceived it necessary for his honour that his Avife should submit without reserve to the claims of a suspicious and exacting affection. The past must, as he said, be dead to her, except so far as he required it to be laid open before him ; old ties Avere severed without remorse, and her one object must be to fit herself for the station to Avhich he had, however involuntarily, exalted her. To begin life anew under such condi tions might seem hard to any woman, but to Amy, whose sweet serenity of manner had owed all its charm to the consciousness that she never failed to please, the prospect was dark indeed. ' Will my father be angry ? ' Alan replied to her inquiry, as they approached Raeburn Castle : ' why, yes : of course he will be angry, but he is a gentleman, and will not vent his displeasure upon you. My mother,"], [15, "a bride's avelcome. 7 who is ambitious, and has always intended me to make a great marriage, will be less easily appeased, and we can scarcely escape a bad quarter of an hour on our first arrival. If the life at Raeburn becomes altoaether intol- O erable, we must anticipate the tAvelfth by going a little earlier to the shooting lodge at Cuchullin, there to reign over the gillies, and to teach you to ride and fish.' They had driven through the lodge -gates, and the carriage was now winding slowly up the wild and woodland ascent which led to the castle. Even at such a critical moment, Helen would have been drawn out of herself at the first glimpse of the bright brown stream which marked the windings of the valley by its turbulent course. The steep banks were fringed with silver-stemmed birch trees and by a sweep of purple heather, stretching away to the background of yet more purple mountains ; but Amy saw it all"], [16, "8 VANESSA. with unseeing eyes, and she looked more often at her husband than at the landscape. Just as a turn in the road brought them within sight of the castle, the carriage-wheel almost brushed the skirts of two men, the one tall and gaunt, with a stooping figure, and a vacant, melancholy stare : the other, Avho Avas evidently his attendant, took him by the arm, and dreAv him aside with a gesture of authority. ' Yes,' said Alan, observing Amy's invol untary shudder ; ' that is poor Macrae. You might be here for weeks Avithout encountering him again. He has his own set of rooms, and only walks out at an hour when people are unlikely to be about. Look at the castle, Avhich has quite an imposing effect from here.' Amy expressed due admiration of the grey, weather-beaten, pile, which, like many of the old Scotch houses, resembled a French"], [17, "a bride's avelcome. 9 chateau in its general features. Tall and narrow, with a roof-line broken by twisted chimnies and pepper-pot turrets, the building was not out of keeping with the wild pic turesqueness of the situation, but it wanted the trim, well-kept air of an English country house. There Avas no flower-garden, the offices lay open to view, and sheep fed up to the front door. ' I must have a Avord with our old servant Hugh before you get out,' said Lord Alan : ' If they are still in ignorance, I propose to try the effect of a coup de theatre. My mother knows that Lady Cecilia was moving heaven and earth to make a marriage betAveen your cousin and myself, and, if they choose to imagine that I come home in triumph with the rich Miss Mertoun, they will be more apt to receive you graciously and cannot for very shame draAv back when the mistake is discovered.'"], [18, "10 VANESSA. The carriage dreAv up as he spoke, and after a feAv moments' earnest conversation Avith old Hugh Lord Alan returned to Amy. ' As far as I can make out,' he said, ' my aunt's malignity has not paved the Avay for a charming reception. Stay where you are until I come back for you.' Amy sat still in the fly, with two servants surveying her from the open door, her feel ings of nervous wretchedness gathering strength in the long interval which elapsed before Lord Alan's return, and when he came at length, his words were scarcely re assuring. ' Yes, you may take the things out of the carriage, Hugh,' he said as he helped Amy to alight, and he added in a Ioav but authoritative voice as they crossed the hall : ' How can you look so white and scared, at a moment when so much depends upon your presence of mind ? Exert yourself, and re-"], [19, "a bride's welcome. 11 member that I expect you to make a favour able impression.' He threw open the drawing-room door, and presented his bride to the two pale, melancholy Avomen whom he named to her as his mother and his sister Janet. Each advanced one step off the hearthrug on which they were standing, and murmured some in audible words of greeting, while extending a limp hand. A military movement could not have been executed with greater precision, and Amy felt confident that the terms of her reception had been pre-arranged. ' Sit down, Amy, and take off your hat/ said Alan, after waiting in vain for the sug gestion to come from Lady Raeburn. Amy complied, with the prompt obedience which had been the first lesson inculcated on her married life, and when she removed her hat, her hair, released from confinement, fell"], [20, "12 VANESSA. in a golden shower over her shoulders. ' We have been travelling all night,' said she, blushing, Avith the prettiest gesture of depre cation. Lord Alan assured her that the disorder Avas not unbecoming, and appealed to his mother to confirm the assertion, but the com pression of Lady Raeburn's thin lips seemed to declare the remark as unseemly as the exhibition itself. ' I think I had better go and put my hair in order,' said Amy, struggling Avith a hys terical sensation in her throat. ' You shall do so as soon as your room is ready,' said Lady Raeburn, and she rang the bell, and desired that the north room might be prepared at once. 'And Hugh,' said Lord Alan, 'tell the housemaid to light a good fire, and to see that everything is thoroughly aired. Amy is not used to our northern climate, and that"], [21, "a bride's welcome. 13 north room always feels like a charnel house,' he added, resentfully. ' I am sorry that you find it necessary to give your OAvn orders,' said Lady Raeburn : 'you should have given notice of your coming if you wished us to make due pre parations.' ' We could not give notice of what we did not know ourselves, could we, Amy ?' said Lord Alan, smiling. Lady Raeburn still remained grimly silent ; and the presence of mind Avhich she had been enjoined to display altogether deserted Amy, for she burst into tears, striving to check her sobs like a chidden child, when she became conscious that her husband's eyes were fixed upon her in severe displeasure. ' I am at a loss to understand the source of your distress,' he said, impatiently. Such an un-lover-like address was grati fying to Lady Raeburn, as it indicated that"], [22, "VANESSA. 14 her son Avas already Aveary of the toy for Avhich he had sacrificed his worldly interests ; and, with the strange complexity of human motives, she instantly began to regard her daughter-in-law with more favourable eyes. ' Your wife's feelings of shame and distress seem to me more excusable than your own levity, Alan,' she said : ' let Janet take her to her room, while you and I talk this matter over, and by dinner time I hope that she will be able to rejoin us.' Amy rose to folloAv Lady Janet, Avho led the Avay up the staircase in silence, and ushered her into a large room, imperfectly lighted by two tall and narrow windows, and obscured by ponderous furniture which had once, perhaps, been rich and handsome, but Avhich was now subdued by time to one uniform tint of ashen grey. The blinds were half-drawn doAvn, and the freshly-lighted fire was feebly smouldering. When Lady Janet"], [23, "a bride's welcome. 15 had remarked that the evening was Avet and chilly, and had volunteered to send her up a cup of tea, she left Amy a prey to her own melancholy thoughts. She walked to the window to shiver at a dreary prospect of bare hills and moorland, shrouded by mist and driving rain, and returned to cower over the fire which seemed only to add to the chilliness of the room, as the rain fell down the Avide chimney -and sputtered into it with a hissing sound. Amy did not know how long she had sat there, in a stupor of fatigue and misery, when she was roused by the sound of Alan's approaching footsteps, a sound Avhich already, alas, made her heart beat with more of fear than pleasure. There was a degree of irritation in his manner which argued that he had obtained little satisfaction from his conference with Lady Raeburn, and he glanced Avith annoyance from Amy to her unopened boxes."], [24, "16 VANESSA. ' Have you not begun your preparations for dinner, Amy ? Unpunctuality is one of the unpardonable sins in this house.' ' The maid brought me a cup of tea, and since that I have been nearly asleep,' said Amy. ' I am so miserably tired that I thought of going to bed instead of dressing for dinner.' ' Leaving me to fight your battle alone, \u2014 no, Amy, that will scarcely do. Such palpable coAvardice must prejudice my father against you, and with him everything depends on the first impression. Had you been guided by me, we should noAv have been cruising in the ,' Vanessa,' without a care in the world ; but since we are here, we must remain until my father thinks fit to provide us with the means necessary for a separate establishment. You cannot sit Avith folded hands until good fortune comes, and I must entreat you to dress in all your bravery,"], [25, "a bride's avelcome. 17 and to exert those powers of fascination in which you Avere not deficient when we met at Leasowes.' Amy knew that such entreaty could only be interpreted as a command, and she exerted herself to such purpose that she Avas ready before Lord Alan returned from his dressing-room to conduct her downstairs. The other ladies had not been equally expeditious, but Lord Raeburn was there, with another gentleman, who proved to be his agent, Mr. M'Clintock. His presence seemed to diminish the awkwardness of the introduction, and Lord Raeburn took her by both hands and kissed her cheeks with as much Avell-bred courtliness as if she had been the daughter-in-law of his choice. He was a broken-down man, prematurely aged by the early dissipation which had impoverished his estate and ruined his health, but the instinct of good breeding had survived the failure of his vol. 11. c"], [26, "18 VANESSA. poAvers of mind and body, and his first desire Avas to relieve Amy's overwhelming em barrassment. ' A little startled, and nervous, eh, my dear ? We shall soon make you feel at home Avith us. What's your name ? Amy \u2014 a very pretty name it is, too. We shall be better acquainted by and by, and if Alan has been reckless and imprudent, I am sure that Ave must all admit the potency of the attraction, eh, M'Clintock?' Mr. M'Clintock, a little, sharp-featured man, Avith bushy red whiskers, and a manner at once fussy and subservient, replied to this appeal by a bow which seemed to denote absolute agreement and as much admiration as his inferior position entitled him to express. How Amy got through the ordeal of that first evening, she herself scarcely knew. Lord Raeburn took her in to dinner, and"], [27, "a bride's welcome. 19 still endeavoured to reassure her by his easy floAV of talk, and by inquiries about her former home, and Amy smiled mechanically and tried to appear interested, and to make such answers as might not offend her hus band, Avhose eyes were, as she was conscious, constantly fixed upon her. There was nothing to draAV off his attention, for although Mr. M'Clintock and Lady Janet conversed a little about the Aveather and the crops, Lady Raeburn maintained the most frigid silence. Amy looked forward with desperation to the moment when the move should be made for the ladies' return to the draAving-room, and was profoundly grateful to Lord Alan for sparing her from this further trial. ' I think, Janet,' he said, as he held open the door, ' that you had better show Amy up to her room at once. She is quite worn out by our night journey.' Lady Janet lighted a candle, disclaiming c 2"], [28, "20 VANESSA. Amy's timid offer to find her own way upstairs, and led the way for her sister-in-law, who felt, as before, as if a gaoler were con ducting her to her cell ; and, indeed, a prisoner would not have envied her the desolate and home-sick yearnings which kept sleep from her pillow that night. The wind moaned and Avhistled round the house, arousing the creaking and mysterious sounds which are apt to infest old woodwork, and which, in this instance her nervous and excited fancy connected with the lunatic, whose face, as she had seen it that afternoon, still haunted her waking dreams. The long hours of darkness and solitude seemed almost intoler able, and yet, Avhen Lord Alan came upstairs, Amy feigned to be asleep, conscious that any attempt to reply to Avords either of reproof or tenderness Avould end in a fit of hysterical sobbing."], [29, "21 CHAPTER II. MEDIATION. ' My dear Eva ! you must forgive me for forcing my way in,' said Lady Cecilia Wray, entering the Leasowes drawing-room with the rustle and flutter which characterised all her movements : ' I called twice before, when you Avere in your bed-room, and as I understood from your servants that you were better, and able to come downstairs, I would not be denied. I feel sure that when the first awkAvardness of meeting is over, it will be a relief to you to know how completely I acquit you of blame in this unfortunate affair.' ' Thank you,' said Eva, in a tone which"], [30, "VANESSA, 22 did not express profound gratitude for this assurance. ' I am really grieved to see you look so ill and suffering/ continued Lady Cecilia, ' you ought not to be left so much alone.' ' My cousin Helen is coming for a few days next week ; in the meantime I think that I am best alone,' said Eva, too sore at heart to be polite. ' Your cousin Helen ; another of the sisters I think,' said Lady Cecilia. ' Then this marriage has caused no .breach betAveen the tAvo families ? ' ' Why should it, Lady Cecilia ? Why should I not see my cousin Helen, because her sister is married to Lord Alan Rae ?

The marriage has been a terrible shock to us all, involving the ruin of all his prospects, as well as family disunion, for Lady Raeburn does not seem at all able to reconcile herself to it. Have you heard from your cousin since their arrival at Raeburn ? ' . 'No,' said Eva, ' I do not imagine that I shall hear from her now.' ' Indeed it is natural that she should shrink from any communication after treating you with such ingratitude and duplicity ; and yet, my dear Eva, I fancy that you will agree with me that it is wise to make the best of an accomplished fact. That is my poor brother's view ; he admires Lady Alan's beauty and her pleasing manners, and so on ; and he believes that Alan is really attached to her. That is a great point, as he has always been so volage, and, if he will settle doAvn and give up his extravagant habits,"], [32, "24 VANESSA. Lord Raeburn will do Avhat he can for them. But, Avith poor Macrae to consider, on whose comfort no expense is spared, and with many other claims upon him, the allowance which he can make to Alan is certainly inadequate to his Avants as a married man, and it has occurred to me that Mr. Mertoun might be induced to come forward.' ' To come forward ? ' repeated Eva, with Avilful obtuseness, since she could scarcely fail to understand Lady Cecilia's meaning. ' To make them an alloAvance, to settle something on his niece, dear Eva. How ever much we may deplore the way it was done, it is really a brilliant marriage for her. She must, humanly speaking, one day be the Marchioness of Raeburn, and her income ought to be in some degree proportioned to her suture position.' ' Would it not be better to talk to papa on"], [33, "MEDIATION. 25 such a matter of business ? ' said Eva after a pause. ' I will gladly do so, when I have secured your kind interest. It cannot be merely a matter of business between you and me, and as I knoAv that you Avere sincerely attached to your cousin, you must allow me to consult you on a matter Avhich concerns her happi ness. Her position in the family is an awkward and distressing one, and, as Lady Raeburn Avrites, there are times when Alan himself seems to repent of the rash step which he has taken. All this would be changed if a fair competence were secured to the young couple, so that they might have their OAvn establishment, and I will answer for it that Lord Raeburn will meet Mr. Mertoun half way, if he is disposed to do anything for them.' ' I will talk to papa about it when you have"], [34, "26 VANESSA. made such a proposal,' said Eva, but even this concession did not satisfy Lady Cecilia. ' Indeed, Eva, the proposal will come better from you. I feel such perfect confi dence in the generosity and nobleness of your disposition, and though Mr. Mertoun might distrust my motives, yours are beyond sus picion. And now, dear child, let us speak of your own health. I fear that you have alloAved this sad business to Avorry you more than it ought.' ' It is the constant anxiety about my health Avhich worries me,' said Eva : ' I believe that I am to be sent away someAvhere, to Switzer land first, then to the south of France. I Avish, Lady Cecilia, that you Avould give my love to Amy in your next letter to Raeburn, and say that I have not felt well enough to Avrite, but that I should like to hear from her.' ' I Avill not fail to give your message,' said"], [35, "MEDIATION. 27 Lady Cecilia : ' I left a letter half-finished on my table, for I knew that it would be a satis faction to her to hear of LeasoAves.' She embraced Eva with the most demonstrative affection, and, as she threw herself back in the carriage, she was disposed to take a less gloomy view of Alan's imprudent marriage. The transparent thinness of Eva's hands, her laboured breathing and hectic colour, were very alarming symptoms, and if Mr. Mertoun were doomed to lose his only child, his large fortune must devolve on the other branch of the family. It was with some such conviction that Eva applied herself to the task which Lady Cecilia had imposed upon her. Her father came home about an hour before dinner, for his application to business was now postponed to his increasing solicitude about his daughter, and he grudged every moment he spent away from her side."], [36, "28 VANESSA. ' Hoav goes it, my child ? ' he said, tenderly: you look a little flushed this afternoon.' ' I am not Avorse, papa : only rather flurried by a visit from Lady Cecilia Wray, Avho forced her wav in.' 'Just like her assurance,' growled Mr. Mertoun, ' she drove to the office twice last Aveek, but I refused to see her. What account does she give of her hopeful young couple ?

But that is all past and gone, and I can see now that I have had a great escape.' ' You speak like a brave and true woman, Eva, and now, my dear, you have nothing to do but to get well.' ' If I can, papa. But you know that, long before I was old enough to think of being crossed in love, the doctors used to shake their heads over me and say that I was hard to rear.

Will five thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds, or nothing short of half a-million be considered a fitting portion ? ' ' I should think ten thousand pounds might do,' said Eva, doubtfully, since she was as profoundly ignorant of the value of money as people are apt to be who have never known what it is to have a wish ungratified. ' I am glad that you are so modest in your ideas,' said her father, smiling : ' I am to crive away five hundred pounds a year to reward Amy for running away after she has"], [40, "VANESSA. 32 been five weeks under my roof.

Do not trouble your little head further in the matter : I will put the offer into Avriting, and if it is declined by Lord Raeburn or his son, there is no great harm done. But perhaps you had better mention to Helen that I do not undertake to pension more than one runaway niece at a time.' ' You must not be unjust to Helen, nor hurt her feelings just as you are going to ask a favour of her. You know, papa, that I have set my heart on her going abroad Avith me.'

Ask Henry to come here next Sunday, on business \u2014 Amy's business I mean \u2014 and let me have him to myself in the afternoon.'

Helen was very much surprised and even a little indignant when he returned to Allerton with his plans cut and dry, and assumed as a matter of course that the only obstacle to her going abroad with Eva was removed. The terms on which he was to enter Mr. Mertoun's office were so liberal that he could make his mother comfortable wherever she might choose to live, and when Helen declared that it Avas hard to demand the sacrifice of her independence, he said with a laugh : ' Dennis warned me that you would trot out Mr. Benson and the sewing-machine, and he advised me to ratten you by cutting off the band of the machine after you went to bed.'"], [43, "MEDIATION. 35 Helen coloured with a deep sense of morti fication.

Amy was not forgotten, and indeed the silence with which her name was passed over did not indicate forgetfulness. Helen had been indignant and Mrs. Mertoun had been sorrowful over the only letter Avhich had reached them, and it was Henry who read between the lines, declaring that the composi tion was dictated, and that, unless Mrs. Mer toun wished to correspond with her noble son in-laAv, the letter might remain unanswered.

His offer was discussed in family conclave \u2014 a council from which Amy was excluded, since she scarcely, even in her husband's eyes, ranked as a member of his family \u2014 and it did not aAvaken any great en thusiasm. Lord Alan considered himself in- sulted by the precautions Avhich had been de vised to secure both interest and principal to his Avife's separate use ; and Lady Raeburn remarked that, to judge by her present costly"], [45, "PRISON BARS. 37 style of dress, the greater part of the allow ance Avould be swallowed up by her personal expenses. Lord Raeburn, who had all his life been expecting a windfall which Avas to re pair his broken fortunes, took a more sanguine view of the transaction, regarding the 5,000/. as only an instalment of the wealth Avhich must devolve on his daughter-in-law on Eva's death ; and Amy Avas a little perplexed by the interest which the old Marquis appeared to take in her uncle's family affairs, his inquiries about Eva's health and the cause of Mrs. Richard Mertoun's early death. It was probable, as he said, that the consumptive tendency was inherited. Lady Cecilia had faithfully transmitted the forgiving little message Avhich it had cost Eva some effort to send, but Lord Alan did not think it necessary to pass it on to his Avife. He thought it might have the bad effect of unsettling her mind, which ought not"], [46, "38 VANESSA. to be diverted from the task assigned to her of raising herself to the level of her new associates, and he discouraged any reminiscences of her former life. No efforts, however, seemed to break down the constraint of Amy's intercourse with her mother and sister-in-law, although she continued to be on tolerably easy terms with Lord Raeburn. Silence and gloom brooded over the family party, and Amy's fancy was constantly haunted by the unseen presence of the unhappy lunatic, whom she did not again encounter in her walks but whose apartment Avas only separated from them by a corridor shut off by double doors. His name was never mentioned in her presence, and Avhen she occasionally met Lady Raeburn coming from that part of the house she swept by with a more stately air of chilling re serve. By her husband's desire, Amy spent her time chiefly in the drawing-room, however"], [47, "PRISON BARS. 39 little she was made welcome there, but she was apt to retreat to her own room Avhen Alan Avas not by to mark her absence. On one of these occasions, he returned from his ride earlier than usual and followed her upstairs. ' I have been looking for you,' he said. ' Why are you moping here ? ' ' I have not been upstairs very long,' said Amy. ' Some visitors came, and, as Lady Raeburn did not introduce me to them, I thought it best to come away.' ' It was exceedingly ill-judged,' said Alan, with displeasure. ' You ought to have stayed, and taken a part in the conversation. Such morbid sensitiveness to petty slights is quite out of place, and will never vindicate your position in my mother's eyes. You should take pains to win her regard, instead of bestowing all your pOAvers of pleasing on my father and M'Clintock.' If Amy made the prescribed efforts, they were so evidently unsuccessful that Lord"], [48, "40 VANESSA. Alan shortly afterwards announced his inten tion of going at once to the lodge at Cuchullin, Avhere he and Amy were to reside during the season of grouse-shooting ; and the change was Avelcomed by Amy, who felt that it might be more possible to win her husband's favour Avhen she Avas withdraAvn from Lady Rae burn's disapproving eyes. The appointments of the shooting-lodge, Avhich had never been intended for a lady's accommodation, were rude and meagre ; and Lord Alan was gratified by his wife's indiffe rence to her personal comfort, and her anxiety to minister to his OAvn. He was not displaced from the occupation of the only easy chair, and Amy spent a whole morning in papering over the crevices in the Avail, through which insidious draughts had Avhistled to disturb his repose. In requital for such attentions, he devoted the first week of their stay at Cuchullin to her amusement. He"], [49, "PRISON BARS. 41 taught her how to throAv a fly, or, at all events, to admire his own dexterity in the art, and he placed her on a Highland pony, and walked by her side over moss and moorland, to dis cover Avhere the grouse lay thickest. It was Avhile he was in this happy mood that Amy found courage to enter on a subject which lay very near her heart. ' I have been thinking, Alan, that I never gave mamma our address, nor even told her that we were going to Scotland, and that must be the reason why I have had no answer to my letter.' ' Mr. Mertoun is aAvare that Ave went to Raeburn, and the post-town can always be found in the peerage,' replied Alan. ' Still,' said Amy, Avith greater timidity, ' mamma may think that you did not wish her to Avrite, as I gave no address.' ' Such a surmise would not be far from the truth, Amy. At all events, the next"], [50, "42 VANESSA. advances must come from your family, and Avhen they are made it will be time enough to decide whether they are to be accepted.' Such an answer Avas not calculated to appease the hunger of home-sickness, but it taught Amy the necessity of restraining its expression. Two days later, hoAvever, when Amy came down to breakfast, she saw among the letters which lay beside her husband's plate one directed to herself in her mother's hand- writing. She saAv, and almost seized it, but at that moment Alan entered the room, and she retreated behind the urn, conscious that the involuntary action might be reckoned against her as an offence. Lord Alan read his own letters as he ate his breakfast, and took up the envelope which bore the Allerton post mark from time to time, without making any comment on it. Amy's heart sank, and she felt an increasing difficulty in replying to"], [51, "PRISON BARS. 43 indifferent remarks Avith any semblance of ease. At length Lord Alan approached the sub ject : ' A letter for you, Amy, has come up from the castle which has the Allerton post mark.' ' I suppose it is from mamma,' said Amy, and she could not, with all her efforts, control the tremour of her voice. Since Lord Alan did not offer to hand her the letter, she said timidly : ' Will you read it first, Alan ?' ' If you really wish to be guided by my advice, Amy,' said Lord Alan, pausing for a moment as if to give greater force to his words by Aveighing them carefully, ' the letter will be burnt un-read : you have been talking at random ever since you came doAvn ; and, since you are so much agitated by the very idea of receiving neAvs from your former home, its effect Avill probably be to unsettle your mind altogether.'"], [52, "44 VANESSA. ' I hope to feel more settled Avhen I have heard of them all/ said Amy. ' I presume that you mean that you will be more settled in your discontent Avith your neAv surroundings,' replied Alan, fixing his eyes upon his Avife Avith a singularly Avild and stern expression Avhich made her feel, as she had so often felt before, that submission was the only course Avhich lay open to her. ' If you think so, Alan, I Avill not ask to read the letter.' ' Do not answer as if I required an abject and slavish obedience,' rejoined Alan Avith increasing irritability : ' your compliance is nothing to me, unless it is the result of con viction.' ' I Avish you to burn the letter,' said Amy, and her husband took her at her Avord, and threAv it on the logs Avhich Avere blazing on the hearth. He waited until it was consumer,"], [53, "PRISON BARS. 45 before he turned round to raise Amy's droop ing face to his own. ' After all, Amy, I believe that you value that worthless piece of paper more than my love.' Amy laid her head on his shoulder and forced herself to smile, even as a dog Avill fawn upon the hand of his cruel master. ' Your love is all the world to me, Alan.' He kissed her again before he left the room ; but Avhen he passed the windows a moment afterwards, whistling to his dogs, Amy abandoned herself to a passion of tears. In her happy days at Leasowes, the corres pondence Avith her family had been only an irksome duty ; but now her heart yearned for the mother's love and tender forbearance from Avhich Alan had decreed that she should be forever estranged : and, indeed, a stouter heart than Amy's might have recoiled from the prospect of being cut off from human sym-"], [54, "46 VANESSA. pathy Avhich Avould have afforded some little relief from the incessant exactions of her husband's jealous and exclusive passion. But her part Avas taken and must be played out ; and when Lord Alan returned to the house an hour later, Amy was able to meet him with a smiling and unruffled face. Then came the twelfth, that era in High land life, and Lord Raeburn came up to the lodge with Mr. M'Clintock to stay for a feAv days. Amy took pains to see that the dinner was tolerably dressed and served, and did the honours prettily ; but the compli mentary remarks of Lord Raeburn appeared to irritate his son, and he spoke sharply to his wife after they Avent upstairs for the night. 'It is all very well to please my father, Amy, but your very easy manners Avith M'Clintock are not to my taste. No doubt you have been accustomed to associate on equal terms with that stamp of man when"], [55, "PRISON BARS. 47 you were living at Allerton, but I wish you to remember that my wife is not to place herself on a level with my father's factor.' At breakfast next morning, Amy scarcely dared to reply to Mr. M'Clintock's remarks on the Aveather, nor to ask him if he took sugar in his tea, and again her husband found an opportunity of saying that she was ahvays in extremes ; he had been seriously annoyed by her want of proper courtesy, and especially since M'Clintock's influence over Lord Raeburn made his good-will a matter of importance to himself. Now that the grouse-shooting had begun, Amy had many lonely hours ; she was not adventurous, and, on the only occasion when she Avandered to any distance from home, she Avas considerably alarmed by the sudden apparition of two or three bare-legged boys Avho sprang out of the heather, and signified to her with the signs and Gaelic vociferation"], [56, "48 VANESSA. which were needed to help out their imperfect English, that she must go back at once ; and it took some time to discover that they had no sinister intentions, and were placed there to prevent anyone from crossing the scent of the deer which Lord Alan was stalking. After this adventure, her walks were restricted to ' the policy,' which consisted of a feAv ruinous outhouses, and a garden chiefly stocked with kale, and a Avilderness of goose berry bushes, so laden Avith fruit as to afford a neAv experience to her English taste. The factor's house Avas situated half-Avay between Raeburn and Cuchullin, and Mrs. M'Clintock drove up the valley to visit Lady Alan at her husband's instigation. Amy was cheered by the sight of a kindly woman's face, and by some innocent prattle about the great people of the county, and told her husband of the visit as a pleasant incident when he returned to dinner ; adding that Mrs."], [57, "PRISON BARS. 49 M'Clintock had asked her to spend an after noon at her house. \u25a0 I suppose that you did not accept the invitation Avithout reference to me ? ' said Lord Alan. - No, Alan ; I said that I was not sure whether you could spare Alick to drive me down in the car.' < 1 am glad that you shoAved that remnant of discretion. I certainly shall not be able to spare Alick.' ' Your sister Janet went to drink tea Avith Mrs. M'Clintock Avhile we were at Raeburn,' said Amy, rather plaintively. ' The cases are altogether different. My sister is a lady by birth, while you have still your position to achieve : and it will not be done by mixing yourself up Avith a lot of middle-class people.' Amy humbly accepted the statement of her inferiority, even if it occurred to her to VOL. II. E"], [58, "A*ANESSA. 50 wonder whether the subtle aristocratic essence lay in Lady Janet's frigid manners, her pronounced Scotch accent, or in the bad taste which distinguished her dress. ' We will go back to the Castle next week, since you cannot live Avithout society,' resumed Lord Alan after a pause. It was a severe punishment for so slight an offence, but the grouse were becoming scarce, the weather Avas bad, and Lord Alan had begun to find his Aviso's gentle and submissive devotion somewhat monotonous. In the presence of a third person, Lord Alan still restrained the display of his irritable and capricious temper; but Hector M'Clintock Avas a shrewd observer, and it was in his mind that the suspicion which had more than once flashed across the unhappy wife, only to be rejected Avith horror, first took definite shape. ' I am not easy about Lord Alan,' he said one afternoon to his"], [59, "PRISON BARS. 51 wise, when he returned from taking lunch at the Castle. ' He used to be a happy, genial tempered young fellow, and I begin to be afraid that his brain is in an irritable state. He was speaking to Lady Alan in a strange wild way when I went into the library this morning; and though his manner changed in a moment, and he seemed confused by his violence, I could see that she did not dare to meet his eye, and that he was constantly watching her.' ' Poor thing ; I fancied that she had a very careworn expression when I went up to see her at Cuchullin,' said Mrs. M'Clintock, com passionately. ' What can you do, Hector?' ' I Avish that I knew what Avas for the best. If I say a Avord to the Marquis he will fuss and fidget, and talk of it all over the neigh bourhood, and if I go to my lady I shall be called an officious old fool for my pains. And yet I cannot see the last hope of the E 2"], [60, "52 VANESSA. family cast aAvay Avhen a timely Avarning may avert the calamity which threatens him.' M'Clintock had spent his life in the hopeless task of bolstering up the broken fortunes of his employers ; and, if he had amassed a suffi cient, although not an ample competence in the course of his labours, loyalty to the house of Rae was still his prevailing motive. He had been treated Avith contumely Avhen he remonstrated against extravagance or mis management, and Avith respectful considera tion Avhen money could only be obtained by his aid, and still Avorked on Avith unabated zeal, looking forward to Lord Alan's succes sion to inaugurate a neAv era of prosperity ; he had, indeed, been more remarkable for his quick parts than for his correct morals, -but M'Clintock had expected his early marriage to supply the ballast in which his nature was deficient. He laid the case before Lady Raeburn as delicately as he could, only"], [61, "PRISON BARS. 53 suggesting that it would be well for Lord and Lady Alan to go to London for a few weeks, as Lord Alan appeared to be out of health and spirits, and might benefit by change of scene and the best medical advice. The unhappy mother could not, would not see in what direction his fears pointed, and declared that Alan was in excellent health, though perhaps a little oppressed in spirits by the society of his inane wife. M'Clintock apologised with his usual deference for obtruding unnecessary advice, but he was satisfied that he had made an impression, and found it difficult to appear surprised at the intelligence which Lord Raeburn imparted to him a day or two afterwards. ' We have settled to let our young couple go up to town for November, as they can turn out at any time if we get a winter let for the house in Eaton Square. What do you think of the plan, M'Clintock ? '"], [62, "54 VANESSA. The agent expressed his cordial approval, and Lord Alan graciously accepted the sug gestion. The short days and bad weather had cut off the resources of out-door amuse ment, and although he had his misgivings as to his wife's fitness for society, he allowed that the dissipations of London in November were not very seductive. But he took the precaution, with his mother's full concurrence, of engaging a middle-aged Scotchwoman as Amy's maid, who was rigid in her views and unattractive in her person, and with whom Lady Alan might walk out when he was unable to accompany her. The preparations for departure were soon made, and when a turn in the road hid the Castle from her view Amy felt as if years instead of months had elapsed since the day when she first caught a glimpse of the grey pile."], [63, "55 CHAPTER IV. THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. Hope had so nearly died out of Amy's breast, that it was scarcely any shock to her to dis cover that the contact with strangers revived her husband's injurious suspicions with added force. Twice in the course of their railway journey to the south he ordered her to change places with him, and on reaching Carlisle he declared his intention of moving into another compartment. ' Could you not see,' he said irritably, ' that I wished you to avoid the insolent stare of that young man who sat opposite to you ? ' ' I did not notice that he stared at me,' replied Amy."], [64, "56 VANESSA. ' Possibly not ; a modest woman would have been conscious of it in a moment.' Instead of resenting the insult implied by these words, Amy sought to disarm her husband's anger by greater docility, and, although the only other occupant of the com partment was an elderly gentleman who alternately read his newspaper and slept over it, she kept down her veil, and looked sedu lously out of window. On the evening after their arrival in town, Amy accepted with gratitude the suggestion that they should go to the theatre, but the same unhappy delusion pursued her there. Just as she was becoming interested in the perform ance, Lord Alan inquired whether it were ne cessary to her happiness to occupy such a con spicuous position, and he so disposed the curtains of their private box that she might neither see nor be seen. As they were driving home he informed her that her levity of conduct"], [65, "THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. 57 had made it impossible for him to take her to any other place of public resort. Any one might have seen when she dropped her fan in the lobby, and allowed a stranger to return it to her, that it was only a flimsy pretext for attracting attention. Amy shed a few tears, but it did not occur to her to rebel, even in thought, against the dictates of her husband's capricious humour ; and indeed one source of her wretchedness lay in the convic tion that since her most trivial acts could be interpreted in such a sense, they must in truth be blame-worthy. The outward circumstances of her life soon became even more cheerless than they had been at Raeburn. Their establishment was on the narrowest sooting, and Lord Alan said that as the house was prepared for letting, it was not expedient to make use of the drawing-rooms, and that they must inhabit the room behind the dining-room ; but Amy"], [66, "58 VANESSA. soon discovered that his real motive was a fear lest she should be guilty of the indecorum of showing herself at the windows which com manded a view of the square. The town housemaid undertook to cook for them, with such indifferent success that Lord Alan, ascribing a succession of failures to Amy's bad housekeeping, seldom took his meals at home ; but he veiled his movements in studied uncertainty, and she never knew whether to expect him or not, except that after a time she began to interpret his assertions by con traries. When he said that he was going out for the afternoon he often returned after a short interval, as if for the purpose of ascer taining that she was taking no unworthy advantage of his absence ; and if he said that he should only be away for a few minutes she sometimes ventured to indulge in the relief of tears with less dread lest he should return in time to detect their traces, and"], [67, "THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. 59 overwhelm her with the bitterest reproaches. He regulated her movements in his absence with rigorous exactness. There were days when he only permitted her to take exercise within the railings of the Square gardens, escorting her across the road himself, and returning with the exactness of a gaoler to unlock the gate when the hour of exercise had expired. In his happier moods he required her to go with her maid, Elspeth, in a cab to the gate of Kensington Gardens, there to pace the broad walk frequented by nursery maids and children ; and he informed her that he should probably walk or ride round the park at the same hour, but that she was on no account to look out for him, from which Amy understood that this indulgence was to be forfeited if her head was even once turned in the direction of the ride. If visitors ever came to the house they were not admitted ; and in after years when Amy looked back to"], [68, "60 VANESSA. those weeks of wretchedness she wondered how it was that her own brain had not given away beneath the protracted torture, which was often heightened by physical terror; although Alan still refrained from any ex pressions of violence, and there was even a studied deference in his manner to her in the presence of his servants. But Amy knew well that they did not regard her as the mistress of her house, but rather as some abject creature whose conduct had ren dered it necessary that she should, in he own interests, be hedged in by such re straints. On one occasion, when Amy, with a transient impulse of independence, put on her bonnet with the intention of walking to Arabella Row to match a skein of Berlin wool, she found Elspeth waiting for her in the hall. ' I understood from his lordship,' she said, ' that you would require me to walk out"], [69, "61 THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. with you whenever you did not take the Square key.' ' Certainly,' said Amy, convicted ofa grave misdemeanour, nor did she ever again attempt to evade the vigilance of her attendant. Nearly three weeks had passed, each day seeming to give fresh colour to the suspicions which clouded Alan's brain, and consequently to add to the rigour of the thraldom in which he held his unhappy wife, when Lord Alan one evening returned from his club and in formed her that he had accepted an invitation for her as well as for himself to dine at Sir John Hawthorne's. ' They are friends of the Wrays,' he said, ' and I think he said that he had met you at dinner.' ' Yes,' said Amy, smiling faintly, as the memory of a time that seemed very far off returned to her : ' he dined at Leasowes, the first time I ever saw you.' ' True,' said Alan gloomily : ' he said that"], [70, "62 VANESSA Lady Hawthorne would call, but I told him that you never saw visitors ; and then he said that she would leave cards with an invitation, and he made me name a day, so that alto gether I did not see how we were to get out of it. So you are to accept the invitation, and I really trust that, after all that has passed, you begin to see the necessity of being more circumspect in your conduct.' ' Yes, indeed, Alan,' said Amy very sub missively, and although she had abandoned all hope of averting his displeasure and sus picion she looked forward to the sight of human kind as to an era in her monotonous existence. She wore full evening dress for the first time since her marriage, and pre sented herself before her husband's eyes with the timid hope of meeting a glance of tran sient admiration ; but Alan found more to criticise than to approve and twice sent her back to her room to make some alteration"], [71, "THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING 63 in her coiffure and trinkets. Consequently they were late, and, as the party was a large one, and dinner was announced almost at once, it was only as she was passing out of the draw ing-room again, that Amy descried with a thrill of very mingled feelings, the fair head of Dennis O'Brien in the centre of a knot of gentlemen. His face brought back all the hunger of home-sickness by which she was now constantly consumed, but only for a moment, and she glanced at Lord Alan with a tightening of the heart, remembering his fierce denunciations on their wedding day ; but his calmness was not disturbed, and her experience of his fluctuating humour inclined her to hope that O'Brien was no longer an object of his resentment. They took their places at the dinner-table, and then Amy discovered that Dennis was her right hand neighbour, and that her husband was exactly opposite to her, but"], [72, "64 VANESSA. partly screened from her sight by an epergne of flowers. In a sort of desperation, Amy kept her face turned towards the toothless old peer who had taken her down, and who desired nothing so much as to be allowed to eat his dinner in peace, undistracted by Lady Alan's disjointed remarks about the weather and the winter exhibitions. Her resources were soon exhausted, and when she began to cut her bread into dice, Dennis felt that his turn was come. ' Are we not to recognise each other, Lady Alan ? ' he said, quietly. ' Oh yes,' replied Amy, dropping her voice below the general hum of conversation. ' But I never expected to see you here to night.' ' The coincidence is not so very surprising. I came to town on business connected with the museum, and Mr. Wray gave me an in troduction to Sir John, who is one of his scientific friends. I am going down to"], [73, "THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. 65 Allerton next week, and it will be a pleasure to your mother to hear that I have seen you.' ' Give her my very best love,' said Amy. At that moment there was a lull in the conversation, and Lord Alan said, with such distinct utterance that it was plain for whom his words were intended, ' I have met Mr. O'Brien, Miss Hawthorne, but neither Lady Alan nor myself have the honour of his acquaintance.' Dennis gave one rapid glance at Amy, and saw that light and colour had faded out of her face, and that the brilliant beauty which had struck him on her entrance, was ex changed for a miserable, anxious, hunted expression, which awakened his deepest com passion. He turned hastily away, and did not address another syllable to her, but Amy knew too well the relentless nature of her husband's suspicions to hope that she could escape reproach. F VOL. II."], [74, "66 VANESSA. It was an infinite relief to both of them when the move was made for the ladies to leave the dining table ; and Amy began to breathe more freely, little dreaming that her ordeal of suffering was only begun. Five minutes afterwards, Lord Alan entered the drawing-room, and went straight up to Lady Hawthorne without looking at his wife. ' You must excuse our taking a hurried departure, Lady Hawthorne. I observed that my wife looked ill at dinner, and as she must wish to go home at once, I have taken the liberty of ordering a cab, instead of wait ing for our carriage.' While Lady Hawthorne expressed civil regret, Amy stood up with pale and agitated looks, which justified the plea of indisposition, and Lord Alan cut short the leave-taking, standing at the open door until she followed him out. They left an uncomfortable im pression behind them, and Miss Hawthorne"], [75, "67 THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. remarked on the strange tone of Lord Alan's reply when she told him that they had arranged that Mr. O'Brien should sit next to Lady Alan, as they both belonged to the Leasowes neighbourhood. ' Ah well, the Rae's are all strange,' said Lady Hawthorne significantly : ' it does not do to interfere between husband and wife, and especially as I had only once seen Lady Alan before, but I pity her, poor thing. Remind me, Bessy, to send to Eaton Square to inquire for her to-morrow morning.' The conversation rippled away to other subjects, before Lord Alan had placed his wife in the cab. Her spirits sank lower when she found that he was going outside, for she understood that he could only trust himself to express the violence of his anger in the privacy of their own apartment. It was a rainy night, and, as they passed a gin-shop with its brilliant gas-lights flashing on the wet F 2"], [76, "68 VANESSA. pavement, Amy noticed a squalid, thinly-clad woman who crept past the shop, drawing her scanty shawl more closely around her, and then after a moment's irresolution, she turned back, pushed open the swing door and went in. Amy did not pity that woman, she only thought of her as of a being less wretched and degraded than herself. Their early return to Eaton Square caused some little commotion among the servants, and Lord Alan once more calmly declared the cause : ' Lady Alan is unwell, and will go at once to her room. Send Elspeth up to her. In a quarter of an hour,' he added, without looking at his wife, although the information was intended for her, ' I shall come upstairs.' Amy hurried through her undressing in the brief interval allotted to her, and Elspeth, with grim compassion for her pale and shiver ing looks, advised her to go at once to bed,"], [77, "THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. 69 but she declined to do this, saying that she would lie down on the sofa in her dressing gown. ' Here is his lordship coming up,' said Elspeth, as if his approaching footsteps had not already found an echo in Amy's fluttering heart : ' Is there nothing I can get for you before I go, my lady ? ' ' Nothing,' said Amy, but she added in tremulous accents, ' I may want you at any moment. Come at once if I ring.' ' Certainly, my lady,' said Elspeth, and when she went back to her supper with renewed appetite, she too remarked that something had gone very wrong between my lord and my lady. Lord Alan entered the room as the maid quitted it, and as he turned the key in the lock Amy resisted with difficulty the inclina tion to scream. She did resist it, however, and lay still, scarcely conscious of anything but"], [78, "70 VANESSA. her own palpitating heart. After looking at her for a moment, Lord Alan spoke : 'It is at least some relief to see you stripped of the finery in which you had arrayed yourself to meet your former, \u2014 shall I say, \u2014 or your present lover. I know now with what object that elaborate toilette was made.' ' Mr. O'Brien was the last, the very last person I expected to see, Alan ; how could I guess that he was in town ? ' ' That is the very point on which I demand information. You have found means to com- municate with him.' ' It is not so, Alan. I have never heard his name since you forbade me to speak of him.' ' The transparent evasion does not blind me to the truth,' said Lord Alan, with increasing vehemence ; ' confess that you made this appointment by letter.' ' Such a confession would be untrue, Alan."], [79, "THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. 71 Since the day os our marriage I have not written nor received a letter which has not passed under your eyes. The servants know and respect your orders to carry every letter to your room before it is delivered to me.' ' How can I trust my servants, when I do not trust my wife ? ' said Alan, gloomily. Up to this moment he had been standing before her, but now, at his gesture of command, she raised herself into a sitting pos ture, so that he might take a place by her side, and this permitted him to feel that she was trembling in every limb. ' Words are not needed,' he resumed, ' so long as your own cringing fears proclaim your guilt.' ' I fear your displeasure, Alan, even when it is undeserved, but it is hard indeed to hold me responsible for the unhappy accident which placed me next to Mr. O'Brien this evening."], [80, "72 VANESSA. ' Do not call it an accident. Say rather that Heaven so willed it, lest I should be the last to know that my wife is false and shame less. Say now what passed between you ; low as the words were spoken, I caught the name of love.' ' I only sent my love to my mother, the mother from whom yon have estranged me. O, Alan, that is all my crime,' said Amy, bursting into tears. Alan caught at the words with the eager jealousy of his diseased mind. ' You admit that it was a crime, \u2014 that you are guilty in your own eyes.' ' I have never wronged you, never, in word or thought. If I erred in speaking to him, it is a fault which need not be repeated.' ' Which cannot be repeated,' said Alan, in a voice which chilled poor Amy's blood with terror. ' Forgive me this time, Alan,' she said, as she caught at his hand, and tried to carry it"], [81, "THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. 73 to her lips, but he shook her off, as if her touch were hateful. ' It is enough, go now to bed.' ' Yes, Alan,' said she, but she paused to raise her swimming eyes to his face in piteous supplication, ' may I first say my prayers ? ' ' It is well thought of. Since you have asked my forgiveness, it only remains to implore the mercy of God.' The tenor of his words conveyed to Amy's terrified imagination permission to send up to Heaven the silent, desperate prayer which springs from the heart of the wretch who knows that a violent death must cut him off from the light of another sun. She knelt by the bedside for a few moments, and then laid herself down. There was an old-fashioned bell-rope hanging by the bed, and the instinct of self-preservation prompted her to pass her hand through the ivory ring which was"], [82, "74 VANESSA. fastened to the cord. Lord Alan, whose eyes were constantly fixed on her, must have seen the action, but he made no comment on it ; he extinguished the candles, stirred up the fire to a blaze, and sat brooding over it. Once he spoke to her, when a brighter flame shot up and was reflected in Amy's eyes. ' You appear to be wakeful, Amy ; if you wish me to read you to sleep, I will read Othello.' Amy shuddered, and hid her face in the bed-clothes to stifle a half-uttered cry of wailing fear. Her fingers were more tightly clenched round the bell-handle, and, if her husband made one step towards the bed, she resolved to pull it, even at the risk of falling a victim to his insane fury before help could come. But the long miserable hours of the night wore away, and Alan still sat by the fireside. Once or twice Amy fell into a doze from which she was aroused in an agony of"], [83, "THE ORDEAL OF SUFFERING. 75 fear by the fall of a coal upon the hearth, or by the slightest change in her husband's position. As the night wore on, the tension of her nerves could no longer be maintained, even although she believed that her life depended upon her wakefulness, and her eyes closed in a heavy dreamless sleep. When she awoke, the fire was out, the light was beginning to struggle through the closed curtains, and Lord Alan was gone."], [84, "76 VANESSA. CHAPTER V. FLIGHT. The reaction soon followed the first feeling of relies and thankfulness. The danger was past for the moment, but Amy recoiled from the thought of having to live through such another night of terror. She pulled the bell cord, which had not left her hand even in her soundest sleep, and Elspeth promptly answered the summons. ' I have slept late, Elspeth,' said Amy, still striving to mask her fears by speaking in her ordinary tone : ' will you ask my lord not to wait breakfast for me ?' ' William wished me to ask whether his lordship intended to breakfast out,' replied the maid : ' my lord must have walked out"], [85, "FLIGHT. 77 quite early, for the chain was taken off the front door before any of us were up.' ' You cannot be sure that he has gone out ; he may be somewhere in the house,' said Amy, as a fresh dread possessed her mind : ' go and tell William to look in every room, but come back to me directly : I cannot be alone.' Elspeth obeyed both injunctions, returning to her mistress with the least possible delay. ' Indeed my lady, William is sure that his lordship has gone out, for he has taken his hat and coat. There is no fear but what he will soon come back,' she added, in a re assuring tone. ' No fear,' repeated Amy, no longer able to be alone with her sad secret : ' I tell you, Elspeth, that I see nothing but fear and wretchedness before me, whichever way I look. My only doubt is, whether he will destroy me or himself.' She was sitting up"], [86, "78 VANESSA. in bed with her hair flowing loose over her shoulders, and her maid could see that its pale gold colour had been streaked with silver by the mental agony of the last few hours. ' Dear heart ! is it come to that ? ' said Elspeth : ' we have said down stairs that my lord looked strange and wild at times, like the young lord at the castle. Mr. M'Clintock will be the best man to guide him till he comes round again.' ' I might send for him,' replied Amy, ac cepting the suggestion, since she had lived long enough at Raeburn to know that the agent's aid was invoked in every possible emergency, ' but even if I telegraph, he will not be here until to-morrow, and if Lord Alan is to come and go, and brood over his fancied wrongs for twenty-four hours more, I shall not live to see it.' ' There is another thing which her lady-"], [87, "FLIGHT. 79 ship mentioned to me before we left the castle,' said Elspeth, producing a scrap of written paper : ' She said that if his lordship was in any way out of sorts, this was the name of the doctor whom she wished him to consult.' Amy took the paper, and read the name and address of Dr. Curran, a physician only consulted in diseases of the brain. She drew back, declaring that she should never dare to tell Lord Alan that she had sent for medical advice without his permission ; but Elspeth overruled her scruples, and took the respon sibility on herself. ' She cannot think for herself, no more than a baby,' said Elspeth as she went down stairs to despatch the two messages. ' She is all of a tremble if there is a rustle in the passage, and, if so be that we can, we must keep my lord from seeing her. You will tell"], [88, "80 VANESSA. all the lies you can think of to keep him down stairs, William.' The footman grinned, but with a due sense of the urgency of the case, for the father of Elspeth M'Grath was an elder of the United Presbyterian church, and a pillar of his con gregation ; and her soul had been grievously vexed by the ungodly ways of her English fellow-servants. An hour later, Dr. Curran Avas shown up to Lady Alan's room, where she had judged it safer to remain. Since her husband had not returned she might relate her trouble without restraint ; yet the tale did not run easily off her stammering tongue, although she gathered confidence from the old doctor's kindly sympathy, and his acute ness in supplying the details which she was ashamed to give. ' And yet, indeed, I am innocent,' said Amy, raising her anxious eyes to his face, for it seemed a matter of course that her actions should be misconstrued,"], [89, "81 FLIGHT. and her words wrested out of their true meaning. \u25a0 Who can doubt it, Lady Alan ? Such delusions are unhappily too common in the cases which come before me every day, and it is essential to the recovery of the patient that the subject of his morbid suspicions should be withdrawn from his society. On your own account also it is necessary ; for I will not disguise from you that you have escaped a great danger, and one to which you must not be again exposed. Will it not be possible for you to leave the house before Lord Alan Rae returns to it ? ' ' I think perhaps he has resolved to see me again no more,' said Amy : ' he never lay down last night, and it was strange that he should go out so early without telling any of the servants when he was likely to return.' ' It is probable that he was partly conscious of the fever in his brain, and hoped to work G VOL. II."], [90, "82 VANESSA. it off by fresh air and exercise. I will take steps to trace him when I have provided for your safety. Can you go to any of Lord Alan's relations ?' ' Oh no ! ' said Amy, turning paler, as she thought of the reception she must meet with at Raeburn if she returned to it without her husband. ' Then you must go to your own family : have you a father and mother living ? ' ' I have a mother,' said Amy, ' but I do not know whether she can receive me, and Lord Alan has not wished me even to write to her.' ' You must have some friend to advise and make arrangements for you,' continued Dr. Curran : ' is there no one in town who knows the family circumstances ? ' ' There is one friend, one acquaintance,' replied Amy, catching up her words as it Lord Alan had been by to denounce the"], [91, "FLIGHT. 83 more familiar term : ' we met him at dinner last night, but I do not know where he is to be found, except that I heard him say that he was to be all to-day at the British Museum.' ' His name ?' said Dr. Curran, taking out his tablets to note it down ; ' it is not a public day at the Museum, so that it will not be hard to hunt him up ; and to save time I will drive there myself and bring him back with me.' ' Not here, not to this house,' said Amy, filled with horror at the suggestion : ' I thought perhaps that you might see him, to ask what I had better do ; but you do not understand that it is the same gentleman whom I have been forbidden ever to meet. When my husband comes to know of what I have done, he will think that his worst sus picions are justified.' ' Be composed, Lady Alan. He need g 2"], [92, "84 VANESSA.. never know it until the balance of his mind is restored, and then he will, look back to these delusions, if he remembers them at all, as the baseless fancies of an uneasy dream. I will take measures to secure you from any risk in my absence, or, if you prefer it, you might go at once into a lodging with your maid.' ' No : I cannot do that,' said Amy, colour ing as she reflected that she was even unpro vided with the means of paying the physician's fee. One of the ways in which Lord Alan's want of confidence in his wife had early declared itself, had been in denying her any command of money ; and when she received a cheque at Michaelmas for the first quarter's interest on the sum which Mr. Mertoun had settled on her, Lord Alan had directed her to pay it into his account, since he considered it more satisfactory that all her bills should be sent in to him. In the aggravated temper"], [93, "85 FLIGHT. of suspicion with which he had lately re garded her, he had even put the money for her cab-fares into Elspeth's hands and at this moment Amy was penniless. ' I shall be as well pleased if you can do without your maid,' continued Dr. Curran ; ' she seems to be a confidential sort of person, and may be useful as an attendant on Lord Alan. I have little doubt that Mr. O'Brien will agree with me that your mother's house is the best place for you, and under all the circumstances you must allow me to act for you ; and remember that I am not afraid of the responsibility. Put your things together, so as to be ready to leave the house at any moment.' ' I will be ready,' said Amy. It was so long since she had been allowed to think or act for herself, that a tone of decision was all that was needed to settle her resolution. Dennis O'Brien had set about his work at"], [94, "86 VANESSA. the British Museum with a distracted mind : his interest in the classification of new species of beetles being considerably modified by the haunting recollection of Amy's wretched face ; and he had just decided to cut short his work for that day, and to return to his lodgings to write fully to Henry Mertoun on the subject, when Dr. Curran's card was brought in, with the request that Mr. O'Brien would see him at once on urgent business. ' I have been hunting you all over the place,' said Dr. Curran, when they met in the lobby : ' I never thought of asking which was your special department, and I sent in vain to the fishes, and the minerals, and the Elgin marbles, before I thought of trying the insects. I have lost a precious morning, and you must get into my carriage at once, and come off with me to Lady Alan Rae's. I will tell you about it as we go along.' ' Excuse me,' said Dennis, drawing himself"], [95, "87 FLIGHT. up with an air of haughty displeasure : ' since it was only last night that Lord Alan dis claimed the honour of my acquaintance, I have not the slightest desire to visit his wife.' ' I know, I know all about it,' said Dr. Curran impatiently, ' what does it signify ? Here is this poor woman, alone and friendless in London, with her nerves shattered by the mental torture to which she has been subjected, and you refuse to stretch out your hand to help her ! ' ' Her brother is the only person who is en titled to interfere in her behalf,' said Dennis : ' I had resolved to write to him of what I observed last night, and now I will send off a telegram to summon him to town.' ' Do so, do so by all means,' said the irritable doctor, ' and before he can be on the spot, his sister will have fallen a victim to the"], [96, "88 VANESSA. jealous frenzy of her husband, and I will have you summoned to attend the inquest.' ' Lord Alan is insane ? ' said Dennis, turn ing pale. ' Not legally insane. There is the diffi culty of the situation. He went out early this morning, and I have left two stable helpers in the hall, with directions that he is to be restrained by force if he offers to go up to his wife ; but men are such fools, that heaven knows what mischief may ensue in my absence.' ' Let us go,' said O'Brien, less patient i f delay than Dr. Curran himself. ' It is almost a hopeless case,' said the physician as they drove through the streets at a rapid pace. ' I heard a good deal about the family tendency to insanity when I was called in to see Lord Macrae some years ago, and he is now perfectly imbecile. But this"], [97, "89 FLIGHT. young man is evidently in a phase of madness more dangerous either to himself or others.' ' If he had really intended mischief, I do not understand his motives in leaving the house,' said Dennis. ' Who can understand the motives of a maniac ? Probably he could not nerve himself to the deed on which his mind was brooding, and wandered out in restless misery, or it may be to provide means for its execu tion. A costermonger would have beaten or kicked his wife to death in the first fury of his jealousy ; but the instincts of refinement sur vive after the mind has lost its balance, and even a razor might seem too brutal an imple ment of his vengence, so that nothing but a pistol would serve for him.' Dennis shuddered, and thought that no car riage had ever taken so long . to traverse the distance between Bloomsbury and Belgravia. When at length they reached Eaton Square,"], [98, "90 VANESSA. there was a commotion in the hall which aroused anxiety, but the story which the three men waiting there were eager to tell relieved his worst fears. About half an hour after Dr. Curran left the house, Lord Alan Rae had opened the door with his latch key and entered the hall. He took a small case out of the breast-pocket of his upper coat, and had just laid it on the hall-table, when his eye fell on the two stable helpers who, paralysed by personal fear, or by the dread of incurring responsibility, would probably have offered no opposition to his will. But the object with which they were placed there, must have flashed across him, for he instantly turned and left the house without uttering a word. ' And you did not follow him ? ' exclaimed Dr. Curran. ' Oh no, sir : your orders were precise that we should on no account leave the house,' said the two men in chorus."], [99, "FLIGHT. 91 Dr. Curran shrugged his shoulders at such a proof of the truth of the assertion he had frequently made, that the imbecility of those who had the credit of being of sound mind at least equalled that of the insane. He took up the case which still lay on the hall-table, and opened it to disclose its contents to O'Brien, consisting of a small new revolver, ready for use. O'Brien turned pale as death, and any lingering misgivings as to the pro priety of withdrawing Amy from her husband's roof were set at rest. She remained in ignor ance of Alan's having entered the house and left it again, and she was ready, as she had promised to be, when a message was sent to summon her down stairs. She came down, dressed for a journey, and closely veiled, as it was her husband's pleasure that she should appear when she went abroad. She gave a startled glance at the two men who were still keeping guard in the hall ; but Dr. Curran"], [100, "92 VANESSA. reassured her, and drew her into the dining room. ' Lord Alan is not here, but we know that he is safe, and he will probably return in the course of a few hours ; Mr. O'Brien has got a cab and is waiting for you outside.' For Dennis was already on the pavement, looking up and down the street, to make sure that Lord Alan was not lurking near to inter cept his wife's flight by violence. ' Where will he take me ? ' said Amy, trembling. ' To your mother's house ; he did not think that the matter admitted of a doubt.' ' If Lady Raeburn comes up, and finds me gone, she will think that I have neglected my duty.' ' Let her think so,' said Dr. Curran, who spent too much of his time in combating the delusions of the insane, to tolerate the scruples of those who were of sound mind : ' it is under my orders that you leave this house, and"], [101, "FLIGHT. 93 without my sanction you must not think of returning to it.' The servant announced that the cab was ready, and Dr. Curran's increasing anxiety about Lady Alan's personal safety would admit of no delay. Dennis was waiting on the pavement and followed Amy into the cab when he had given directions to the driver, but on neither side was there any inclination to break silence. When they were seated in the railway-carriage, and Amy was relieved from the immediate dread of an encounter with Lord Alan, she found voice to speak. ' Have you telegraphed to my mother or to Henry ? ' ' I had no time to do so,' replied Dennis, ' even if it had been advisable. However startled Mrs. Mertoun may be when you appear, the shock will soon be lost in the pleasure of having you once more with her.' ' I know that mamma will be good to roe,'"], [102, "94 VANESSA. said Amy, ' but I shrink from seeing Henry and Helen, and from the curious eyes of Allerton.' ' None of the three will trouble you,' answered Dennis, realising the gulf which her marriage had placed between Amy and her family ; ' it is two months since Henry resigned his clerkship at the bank and went into his uncle's office. Helen is wintering abroad with Miss Mertoun, and since the idea of returning to Bixley was evidently distasteful to your mother, Henry has rented for her the little thatched cottage outside the Manor Farm. Henry and Dick spend alternate Sundays with her, and I was there last Sunday. She was looking so well, and in easy, cheerful spirits.' Amy was a little drawn out of herself by her interest in these details, but as they approached the Allerton station she relapsed into silent dejection. She looked up for a"], [103, "FLIGHT. 95 moment when they reached a turn in the line, skirting a copse in which she had often walked with Dennis by her side, but there was nothing in its associations which seemed to alter the gentle, yet distant, courtesy of his manner. Although, by a strange revolution of fate, they had been once more brought into outward contact, The unplumb'd, salt, estranging sea, still flowed between their hearts. ' Do you wish me to drive with you to the cottage ? ' he asked, as they reached the platform. ' Unless it is very inconvenient to you,' said Amy, humbly, for she felt the impossi bility of meeting her mother alone. And yet how little formidable it was ! Dennis went in first, and before the tale was half told, Mrs. Mertoun had hurried to the door."], [104, "96 VANESSA. Amy flung herself into her arms with the half-stifled cry : ' O mamma ! I wish, I wish that I had never left you!' and Mrs. Mertoun's only thought was of how the fatted calf was to be killed for her. Dennis was unceremoniously dismissed without a word of acknowledgment for that day's services, as Amy afterwards remembered with some remorse, to intercept Miss Charlton and warn her not to drop in, as she often did, at four o'clock in the afternoon. Mrs. Mertoun must have Amy to herself, to comment with the tenderest pity oh her changed looks, to chafe her chilled hand's, and fondle and purr over her like a cat over its recovered kitten. Amy's exhaustion was so great that she could not respond to such endearments, and when she lay and cried silently her mother's instinct was not at fault, and she refrained from any inquiries"], [105, "FLIGHT. 97 about the terrible necessity which had driven her to seek refuge at her old home, although O'Brien's brief intimation of Lord Alan's unsettled state of mind had left much in obscurity. ii VOL. II."], [106, "98 VANESSA. CHAPTER VI. SUSPENSE. The next morning's post brought a letter from Elspeth, informing her that since the afternoon was far advanced without bringing further tidings of Lord Alan, Dr. Curran had put the matter into the hands of the police. She also enclosed a telegraphic communica tion from Mr. M'Clintock to the effect that he and Lady Raeburn would take the night mail to the south, and adding the advice, which Amy had anticipated, that she should send at once for Dr. Curran. ' By this time they are in London,' she thought, ' and they must think my conduct strange and heartless in leaving the house while Alan's fate is still uncertain.'"], [107, "SUSPENSE. 99 Amy was not long left in doubt of the nature of Lady Raeburn's sentiments. That day passed without events, but on the follow ing morning when she came downstairs, harassed with anxiety because the post had brought her no further tidings, her mother met her in great agitation, and informed her that Lady Raeburn was in the dining-room. ' She will not come upstairs,' continued Mrs. Mertoun, ' and the fly is waiting which brought her from the station. Oh, Amy ! you must not let her take you away.' The same dread was repeated in Amy's blanched face as it occurred to her that Lord Alan had returned to Eaton Square, and had sent his mother to summon her to his presence. ' I must see her ; perhaps she will believe what Dr. Curran said to me,' said she, and since delay only added to her fears, she put Mrs. Mertoun aside with a. kiss, and entered the dining-room. H 2"], [108, "100 VANESSA. Lady Raeburn was sitting by the fire, and spoke with the same ceremonious politeness with which she might have addressed a stranger : ' You will excuse my rising, Lady Alan ; I am an old woman, aged even more by sorrow than by years.' ' I too have suffered,' said Amy, in the faint hope that their common sorrow might soften the heart of the wretched mother towards her. ' You have suffered ? ' repeated Lady Raeburn, bitterly ; ' true, you have suffered from the selfish fear which prompted you to fly from your husband's house, although it is still doubtful if he is among the living. You have suffered disappointment also in your schemes for advancement by this fatal marriage \u2014 returning to the obscurity from which my son's misplaced love exalted you, with nothing but your empty title. But what is your sorrow to mine, who am"], [109, "SUSPENSE. 101 doomed to see my beloved son, the last hope of our ill-fated family, sink into imbecility or a dishonoured grave ? ' Amy remained silent, wondering whether Lady Raeburn had come down to Allerton only for the purpose of loading her with such reproaches, until she spoke again. ' I have come this morning, Lady Alan, partly from the restless misery which will not suffer me to be still, partly from the hope that you may be able to give some clue to the search for Alan.' Mr. M'Clintock has been sum- moned by the police to see two disfigured corpses, in neither of which he can recognise my unhappy boy, and they are altogether at fault. Did he say nothing by which he might be traced ? ' ' Nothing,' said Amy, bursting into tears ; ' you know yourself how little confidence he reposed in me.' ' The discreditable facts connected with"], [110, "102 VANESSA. your marriage had made confidence impos sible,' continued Lady Raeburn, with relent less severity ; ' I date the unsettling of his mind from the day that he was first ensnared by you. His eyes were opened too late to his irretrievable mistake, and he brooded over it until his senses gave way. Even within the last few weeks the calamity might have been averted by a woman of courage and resource ; but you have sat still to see his mind gradually lose its balance, and only ask for help when your personal safety is at stake.' Amy felt that it was as impossible to attempt her justification in Lady Raeburn's eyes as in those of her son. ' I have been very wretched,' she said, ' but I would suffer even more to restore Alan to you.' ' The fact that you have voluntarily left his roof must of course relieve you from any future interest in his welfare,' replied Lady"], [111, "SUSPENSE. 103 Raeburn. ' Mr. M'Clintock, however, thinks it possible that if my son is wandering aim lessly from place to place, he may come here in search of you.' ' And what do you wish me to do in such a case ? ' said Amy, to whom the possibility had not suggested itself. Lady Raeburn remarked her look of terror, and went on with increasing severity : ' I trust, Lady Alan, that you will prepare yourself for the emergency, instead of allow ing your fears to paralyse exertion. You must receive him with such tenderness as your nature is capable of displaying, and detain him until Mr. M'Clintock can be upon the spot. I return to London, with faint hope of receiving any tidings of my son ; and, if my worst fears are realised, and he is now beyond the reach of human care, it is little likely that you and I will meet again in this life.' Amy understood that Lady Raeburn"], [112, "104 VANESSA. disclaimed by these words any future interest in her daughter-in-law, whose other offences were aggravated in her eyes by the fact that her marriage with Alan Rae afforded no prospect of an heir to the Raeburn peerage ; and yet, to those who knew even a little of the ordeal through which Amy had passed, it might seem a matter of rejoicing that the taint of hereditary insanity, which clung like a curse to her husband's race, was not to be perpetuated through another generation. Mrs. Mertoun was infinitely relieved to see Lady Raeburn drive off alone : she had hovered round the door with the half-formed intention of summoning George Charlton to detain her by force if she had proposed to take Amy with her. ' You need not be uneasy, mamma,' said Amy, sadly : ' I think that I am an outcast from all love but yours. Lady Raeburn bitterly resented our marriage, and she now"], [113, "SUSPENSE. 105 holds me responsible for Alan's loss of reason. ' I could see that she was a proud, cruel woman when she swept by me so haughtily ; and yet she is a mother, and ought to pity my child as well as her own.' ' She said some hard things which were true as well as hard,' replied Amy ; nor could all her mother's tenderness relieve her spirits from their weight of care and self reproach. Each day, as it went heavily by, added its weight of uncertainty to the previous burden of suspense. Amy had been for four days at the cottage before she saw Henry Mertoun ; since his uncle had gone abroad to join Helen and Eva for a few weeks, leaving everything in his charge, and he was absorbed in business cares. When he came he was tender and good to his sister, but her sense of restraint and misery was greater in his"], [114, "106 VANESSA. presence, and she was relieved when Monday morning took him back to Bixley. But Miss Charlton's visits were, after the first recoil from a fresh face, some relief to the monotony of the day ; and Amy could submit to the knowledge that her unhappy circumstances were the subject of much confidential talk between Mrs. Mertoun and her friend, although no allusion was made to them in her presence. ' Lady Alan has such pretty manners,' Miss Charlton observed to her brother after one of her visits to the cottage : ' she was not always so gracious when I used to see her as a girl. Poor thing ! it is difficult to remember that was only six months ago when I look at her now, with all her fine bloom gone, and her hair put away under a lace cap. I saw the silver threads glistening for myself to-day, although I would not believe Mrs. Mertoun when she said that her"], [115, "SUSPENSE. 107 hair had turned grey. I wonder what little delicacy we can send her that she would fancy, George ? Her mother says that she hardly eats anything.' George Charlton was soon permitted to testify his sympathy and good-will in another mode, for Amy asked Miss Charlton if her brother could spare the time to call upon her, and he obeyed the summons with a due sense of the honour done to him. ' It seems a strange thing to ask,' said Amy, with a wistful look in her eyes, ' but Lady Raeburn said that if her son was wandering about, he might come here ; and I cannot sleep at night for thinking what I shall do if he comes, and how much it will terrify my mother.' ' Send for me at any hour of the day or night,' said George Charlton. ' I will have a bell fixed to the roof of the cottage, and one warning stroke will bring me here. Or you"], [116, "108 VANESSA. know what pleasure it would give us to receive you and Mrs. Mertoun at the farm, if you would prefer it.' Amy declined this offer, but she felt less nervous now that she had secured Mr. Charlton's protectorship ; and such was the vigilance of his guard, that Mr. M'Clintock narrowly escaped being arrested as a dan gerous lunatic when he walked out from Allerton to the cottage a few days after this conversation. It was true that he was a short man and middle-aged, but the appear ance of a red-haired stranger who spoke with a Scotch accent when he enquired his way to the cottage seemed to justify suspicion, and George Charlton followed him to the door, to ascertain that Lady Alan had really given orders that he should be admitted as soon as he sent in his card. Amy had, in fact, been corresponding with Mr. M'Clintock, and his visit was a matter"], [117, "SUSPENSE. 109 of appointment. He persisted in recognising her claims as Lord Alan's wife, which Lady Raeburn was equally resolved to ignore, and he wrote to inform her that, as he was on the eve of returning to Scotland, he proposed to do himself the honour of waiting on her. ' It was good of you to come, Mr. M'Clin tock,' said Amy, ' and especially since I know from the newspapers that there is no news of my husband.' ' If the papers would let the matter rest, instead of putting in their sensation para graphs about the mysterious disappearance of a young nobleman, we should have more chance of getting hold of the right clue, Lady Alan.

Only yesterday I was sent for into Norfolk to identify a swindler, well known to the London police, who had passed himself off as a lord to some fool of an innkeeper.' And Mr. M'Clintock flourished his silk handkerchief across his bald forehead with an air of irrita- tion. ' And do you go back to Raeburn because you give up the search as hopeless ? ' enquired Amy. ' Not exactly that, Lady Alan. Of course I shall be summoned to return if there is anything to be done, and Lady Raeburn remains in Eaton Square with Lady Janet, who is coming up this evening. But we do not think it well to bring the Marquis under"], [119, "SUSPENSE. 111 the influence of all this excitement and anxiety ; and as he is getting restless, I am wanted at Raeburn on that as well as on other accounts.' ' I would go and stay with him at Raeburn if it would be of any use,' said Amy, but M'Clintock shook his head. ' No, Lady Alan, I do not think it would do. The Marquis would be pleased to see you ; he sent you a kind message in his last letter to me ; but you know that Lady Raeburn's temper is rather peculiar, and in this sad trial we must defer to her wishes in every possible way.' ' I wish to be guided by them,' replied Amy. ' Can you tell me what she would like me to do about wearing mourning ? ' ' Not at present, Lady Alan, certainly not weeds just at present. That simple black dress is quite sufficient, and from what Lady Raeburn said I do not think she will put on"], [120, "VANESSA. 112 mourning for another three months : that will give us time to make enquiries in other parts of the world.' ' You think that he has gone out of the country ? ' said Amy. ' I tell you that I am quite at a loss what to think, and am never in the same mind for two minutes together. But he was not with out money, for I find that he cashed a cheque for 20/. on the day you dined at Lady Haw thorne's, and he was always fond of the sea.

Poor lad ! If he is to come back to us like his brother, I would as soon have certain news of his death.' As M'Clintock rose to go, Amy said timidly that he must thank Lord Raeburn for thinking of her. ' And that reminds me, Lady Alan, that I only gave half his message, for the Marquis went on to say something about making a suitable provision for his daughter-in-law. But I do not see my way to it \u2014 I really do not, Lady Alan. The em barrassment of the estate was bad enough before, and now, with this uncertainty as to the fate of the heir presumptive, I do assure you that I hardly know how to lay my hands on a 5/. note for the current expenses of the search.'

I do not consider that I have any claim on him.' The agent pronounced such a declaration to be very ' handsome,' and they parted with mutual expressions of good will ; and, on M'Clintock's part, with a certain consciousness of disloyalty towards his aristocratic clients, because he could not forbear to contrast their frigid and haughty bearing somewhat un favourably with the gentle deference of Lady Alan's manners."], [123, "115 CHAPTER VII.

But it soon appeared that it was not Helen, but Eva, who had surrendered her liberty of action and of judgment to her cousin's stronger will.

When the shortening days obliged them to exchange Switzerland for the Riviera, it was Helen whose republican soul was vexed by the re strictions of imperialism and of French bureaucracy, and who decreed their removal from Cannes to Nice, from Nice to Mentone, until they were fairly beyond the French frontier, and had established themselves for the winter months in a small white villa 0,1 the outskirts of Genoa. It was in vain for Misbourne to deplore the difficulties of keep ing house after the English fashion when her tools and her materials were alike foreign ;. Helen replied that it was their duty and privilege to live on maccaroni and parmesan cheese, and on fritturas which were redolent of olive oil, and that it was only the perverted"], [125, "CERTAINTY. 117 appetite of a Philistine which could hanker after an English leg of mutton. It was in favour of domestic harmony that Helen had too many engrossing interests to interfere with Misbourne in the housekeeping department. Her taste for natural science was postponed to artistic pursuits, and she rushed into the wide field of Italian literature, and drew Eva with her so far as to induce her to take lessons in the Italian language. Helen's object was to read and understand Dante, and her grasp of the subject made her an afflicting pupil to her old Florentine teacher, who did not consider that it lay with in his province to explain obscure astrono mical or historical allusions, and who wished to substitute the amenities of Metastasio for the Divina Commedia, declaring that they were better adapted to display the genius of the Lingua Toscana. But Helen was in exorable, and got up her canto for the after-"], [126, "118 VANESSA. noon's lesson with research which enabled her to convict Signor Cantani of ignor ance, although he could take his revenge in the severity of his criticisms on her halting Italian. Helen found another scope for her energy in the study of modern politics, which neces sarily developed the most ardent zeal for Italian unity. She incited her cousin to take drawing lessons from an eminent republican, and reproached her ungenerous want of sym pathy when Eva ventured to assert that he was greater as a patriot than as an artist, and that he. would be a more acceptable teacher if he did not invariably dine on garlic. Eva's spirits revived under this stimulating treatment, and when her father joined the two girls at the Villa Nervani, a few weeks before Christmas, he was delighted by her look of health and animation. ' Yes, papa,' said Eva brightly ; ' I am really well, stronger"], [127, "CERTAINTY. 119 than I have ever been. Travelling has agreed with both of us. Helen was always the picture of health, but now she is remark ably handsome.' ' I must look at her from that point of view,' said Mr. Mertoun. ' I have not yet had time to look at any one but you.' ' Your tone is disparaging, papa,' said Eva. ' But if you do not admire her, your taste must be in fault. She had always a striking face, and now that she has fined down, and dresses in better taste, I can assure you that she makes a great impres- sion. ' So much the worse, Eva. One elopement in the family is enough, and I shall have to send out a chaperon to look after you both.' ' Helen errs on the side of misanthropy,' said Eva, laughing, ' and especially since our Swiss adventure.

They took an interest in her botanising, put up at the same inn, and got up at some un earthly hour next morning to get her some Edelweiss, which grows on higher summits than we could reach. I told Helen that they were very attentive, but she denied it strenuously, and said that we should see no more of them. However, they drifted back -to our inn three days afterwards, and then the thing was too palpable. They waylaid us in our walks, bribed the Kellner to keep places for them at our end of the table at dinner, and were always bringing in botanical speci mens, which Helen rejected as worthless, in the most summary manner. She was as rude as only Helen can be, and when at last they went off disconsolate, I asked her which of"], [129, "CERTAINTY. 121 the two had made her an offer. Helen coloured all over, and said with the deepest mortification, ' My dear, it was both of them.' And since that adventure she has hardly liked to speak to anyone under sixty.' ' At all events she is in less haste to get married than Amy,' observed Mr. Mertoun. ' What have you heard of Amy, papa ? ' said Eva, with a slight change of tone, but no embarrassing consciousness. ' Nothing, except that I met Lady Cecilia in Bixley the other day, and she told me that the young couple were in London.' ' Amy often said how much she should enjoy a London season,' said Eva. ' I hope that they will come to stay with the Wrays after we go home, for I wish you to see that I am quite, quite satisfied with things as they are. Helen is my young man now ; she gives me the sense of strength and stability on which I have always wished to lean. '"], [130, "122 VANESSA. 'Ah! 'said Mr. Mertoun thoughtfully, as it occurred to him that Helen's brother might be a yet more efficient support. He had been attracted by the sturdy independence of Henry's character, even when it conflicted with his own peculiarities, and now that their interests were united, he found that his nephew's acuteness and capacity for busi ness surpassed his expectations. Richard Mertoun had himself married his master's daughter, and he did not look higher for his only child. Shortly after this, the budget of English letters arrived which clouded the enjoyment of the little party at Villa Nervani. Mrs. Mertoun wrote, and Henry, and Dennis O'Brien, each giving their version of the circumstances which had driven Amy to take refuge at her mother's house ; only from Amy herself there was nothing but a contrite little message, that she would send her love to"], [131, "CERTAINTY. 123 Eva if she dared, but must first wait to hear that she was forgiven. Eva's tears flowed fast as she read these words in Mrs. Mertoun's letter, and she pressed her father's hand, who understood the direction of her thoughts. ' You see that I was right, my little one, to warn you against courting Amy's fate. I hardly like to think of what the poor thing has suffered, and that she has lost her husband by such v terrible end.' ' You think that he is dead ? ' ' It seems the most probable way of accounting for his disappearance ; but very few days must put the matter out of doubt, since people do not in our time succeed in shrouding their fate in mystery.' Dennis O'Brien wrote to Helen, thinking, as he said, that she had a right to know the particulars which he alone could give, and in all that he said of Amy there was a tone of deep"], [132, "124 VANESSA. but repressed feeling, revealing itself most plainly in his concluding words : ' It is easy to see how much she has suffered, Helen ; she is so changed that I believe you would hardly know her.' Helen was very much agitated, remorseful for the hard thoughts she had nourished against her sister, and anxious to return at once to England. But however little Eva's opposition might have served to detain her, Mr. Mertoun exerted his authority, declar ing that there was nothing for Helen to do, that Mrs. Mertoun was evidently content to be alone with Amy, and that in any emergency which might arise his presence was more likely to be required ; so that it was expedient for Helen to remain with Eva. Helen acquiesced in the verdict, but she was very restless and unhappy ; Signor Cantani was no longer oppressed by her unreasonable energy as a pupil, and her interest in her private readings in Vasari and Sismondi was"], [133, "CERTAINTY. 125 altogether lost in the hunger for news which sent her on many fruitless errands to the Genoa post-office. It was after one of these expeditions, on which she had been accompanied by her uncle Richard, that they turned aside into one of the busy streets leading to the quay. They both enjoyed the stir and animation of the sea-faring population, and Helen was never tired of watching the little knots of sailors, as they fell into picturesque groups, and talked together with eager gestures, their black eyes flashing from under their scarlet caps. Her attention Avas arrested by the Avay in Avhich the bystanders collected round one animated speaker, and she Avas startled to see him break through the circle and advance toAvards her, cap in hand, and Avith a pleading smile, Avhich betrayed his toav of glittering teeth. ' Siete Inglese ? ' he said in a tone of enquiry."], [134, "126 VANESSA. ' Si,' replied Helen, resisting her uncle's attempt to draw her from the spot, and smiling at his Avhispered Avarning that the felloAV only meant to be insolent. Her knoAvledge of spoken Italian Avas imperfect, and the speaker's Genoese dialect Avas by no means classical in its purity, so that the tale had to be twice repeated before she caught even a glimmering of its meaning. At last her face lighted up Avith the most eager excitement, and she was able to satisfy her uncle's impatient enquiries as to Avhat the fellow Avas jabbering about. ' He Avants us to go on board his ship to see a sick compatriot\u2014sick in mind, I think he says \u2014 Avho has come Avith them from Livorno, or London \u2014 I cannot make out Avhich \u2014 and they do not knoAv Avhere to bestoAv him.

Mr. Mertoun, Avho did not consider that the risk Avould be diminished by his sharing it, Avas more provoked than amused by the suggestion. 00 > ' Indeed, Helen, you will neither go alone nor in company, unless Ave have a policeman at our heels.' ' I believe that the police are the only untrustAvorthy class in Italy,' replied Helen, Avho never omitted an opportunity of airing"], [136, "128 VANESSA. her liberal sentiments. She turned again to the Italian, and his reply to her enquiries gave colour to the suspicion which had flashed through her brain. ' Listen to this, Uncle Richard : it is the ship which is called the ' Livorno,' and she comes from the port of London. She sailed on November 25, and that Avas the very day of Lord Alan's disappearance. This sick man is a young, fair-haired English milord, as they say that they havre discovered from the papers he has about him, and I do not see that it is possible to doubt that it is Lord Alan himself.' Mr. Mertoun admitted the justice of the inference, and although he held back as long as he imagined that Helen Avas actuated by a Ouixotic desire to be of service to a vague Englishman, he Avas noAv nearly as eager as herself to folloAV up the clue.

The ' Livorno ' had only just come into harbour, and lay outside of tAvo other vessels, which it AAras necessary to cross in order to reach her. They were all encum bered Avith cordage and merchandise, and Mr. Mertoun congratulated himself, Avith British complacency, on the more trim appearance of the barges Avhich Avere un loaded at his Avharf in Bixley. It Avas the mate of the ' Livorno ' Avho had conducted them on board, and the captain noAv came forA\\*ard, Avith a feAv Avords of English at his command, in Avhich he invited Mr. Mertoun to go below and see the gentle man for himself.

Helen was the first to glance at the address of the bundle of letters Avhich he produced, and she exclaimed with agita tion : ' There is an envelope directed to Lord Alan Rae ! Oh, poor Amy ! ' Mr. Mertoun hesitated no longer, and left Helen on the deck, surrounded by a group of sailors, Avho spoke Avith greater volubility and less distinctness as they observed her over-mastering excitement. She gathered from the various accounts that Lord Alan had offered gold to the boat's crew of the ' Livorno ' to toav him out to any one of the three ships which Avere to be tOAved doAv'n the river that morning, and that the captain of the ' Livorno ' received him on board Avith reluctance, and with the intention of putting"], [139, "CERTAINTY. 131 him ashore at Gravesend. The milord, how ever, who insisted on going beloAV before the pilot came on board, succeeded after a long and earnest conversation with the captain in inducing him to take his passage money. He solemnly declared that it was no fault of his OAvn Avhich made him an outcast from his home and country, but that the unnatural treachery of a woman had plotted his confine ment in a mad-house, in order to screen her OAvn guilt. He spoke with such rational calmness that no suspicions were entertained of his sanity ; but after he had been for a feAv days on board the vessel, his increasing gloom, his haggard looks and restless mutter ing, awakened uneasiness, and he was con stantly Avatched, and secured by force at a moment when he was about to throw himself into the sea.

For some days he had been sinking into a state of unconscious exhaustion, from AA'hich he could Avith difficulty be roused to take nourishment, and his end appeared to be ap proaching. Mr. Mertoun presently returned to confirm the sailors' story. ' It is Alan Rae,' he said, ' but so changed that his OAvn mother might not recognise him. I must get a doctor at once to decide Avhat can be done, and you must go home, Helen, and tell Eva, as gently as you can. ' Shall Ave prepare a room for him ? ' said Helen.

' You can be of use to Eva, none here. Indeed my dear, the scene is not fit for a girl of your age, but you may rely on my doing all that can be done in such a case. Go home noAv. There Avas something in Richard Mertoun's tone Avhich enforced obedience, and Helen obeyed at once. They left the quay together and Mr. Mertoun put Helen into a carriage to return to the Villa Nervani, Avhile he went in search of the physician Avho had attended Eva, and Avho had some knoAAdedge of English. It was late in the evening before the tAvo girls had any further tidings, and they were on the point of sending Misbourne into the toAvn, escorted by their Genoese man cook, when Mr. Mertoun came in.

In the earlier days at Allerton she had Avorked off her super fluous energy in manual labour, and had spent her hardly earned hours of recreation in the society of Henry and Dennis O'Brien; but noAv that the contribution Avhich Amy Avas able to make to her mother's income placed them above pecuniary anxiety, Helen felt that the idyllic life of Charlton Manor, which had been very welcome as an occa sional refreshment, Avould pall upon her active spirit. It was agreed, therefore, that Helen should reside at LeasoAves, but she made frequent visits to the cottage and to the Manor farm, and the tAvo Charltons listened Avith unflagging interest to her accounts of Savjss dairies, and of the Italian mode of cultivating the soil ; Avhile Miss Charlton dilated in turn on dear Lady Alan's"], [147, "AN INTERVAL. 139 pretty ways, and on the satisfaction it gave her brother and herself to see her look less sadly worn, and pale than she had done through the winter.

At Leasowes the masculine element Avas more liberally introduced, since Henry Avas almost as much at home in his uncle's, house as at his office, and was apt to bring O'Brien as well as the younger Richard in his train.

Although she and Helen were of an age Avhen most girls abandon them selves to the career of frivolous pleasure seeking Avhich is assumed to be the inalien able privilege of young ladyhood, they led a studious and secluded life, even at LeasoAves, and were still more absorbed in their course of self-culture in the second Avinter which they spent in Italy.

' I never yet asked a feAv friends to dinner that you did not make a grievance of it,' said Lady Cecilia, with a deep sense of injury : ' since you do not like the trouble of entertain ing my guests yourself, it is necessary to invite them when there is some third person to take the trouble off your hands. Poor Alan was invaluable on these occasions.' And there was something in her tone which implied that her nephew's life and senses ought to have been spared, in order that he might fill that important niche in the social gatherings at the Hollies. ' Is Lady Alan coming to dinner ? ' inquired Mr. Wray. ' O dear no, William. You forget that"], [155, "RENUNCIATION. 147 Alan has scarcely been dead eighteen months, and his widow has shoAvn some proper feeling by living in the strictest retirement.

' They do not entertain as they used to do,' replied Lady Cecilia : ' I believe that eccentric Helen Mertoun sways Eva just as the other sister used to do.

' If you mean your plan for marrying her to Alan, Eva Mertoun can scarcely regret your failure,' replied Mr. Wray ; and his wife Avas so painfully affected by the want of feeling shoAvn in such a reference to her family mis fortunes, that he really believed himself to be responsible for introducing the subject into their discussion. If Lady Cecilia Avished to secure the Mer toun family at her dinner-party, she was Avise to throAv out O'Brien's name as an allurement. Henry Avas keen to go, Eva and her father not unwilling, but Helen drew back, saying that she supposed that Dennis Avas not too great a man to come and see them next day, Avhich would be more satisfactory than meet ing at a formal dinner-party. ' Will he not be hurt by your refusal to meet him ? ' asked Eva."], [157, "RENUNCIATION. 149 ' He must be very much altered if his feel ings are so easily wounded,' replied Helen. ' Besides I think it would be better to accept on Amy's account : I mean,' Eva added, as Helen looked up with a vivid blush, ' that Lady Cecilia cannot be moderately civil to us Avithout recognising the connection Avith Amy, Avhom she is anxious to slight. I make a point of talking of Lady Alan Rae, whenever I see her in general society.' ' Your Avorldly Avisdom is truly edifying,' observed Helen : 'on that account then I will go, since you and Henry think it expedient.' Although sometimes accused of brutal sin cerity, her assumption of indifference on this occasion Avas hypocritical, since she was burn ing Avith impatience to see Dennis once more. The eccentricity condemned by Lady Cecilia betrayed itself in Helen's dress, which was not modelled after the fashion of other"], [158, "150 VANESSA. young ladies. On the occasion of this dinner party she wore a cinnamon coloured silk, closed at the throat and wrists by an edging of old Roman lace, which had been Eva's gift, and the only ornament of her dark hair was a natural scarlet rose, a perfect specimen of General Jacqueminot. Her eyes were bright, her cheeks a little flushed, but the com posed stateliness of her manner betrayed none of the excitement Avhich she felt, and Lady Cecilia remarked to her dearest friend, Lady Ashford, that it was really absurd to see the poor dependant on her cousin's bounty give herself the airs of a tragedy queen. Eva, on her side, seemed quite content to fall into the shade, and watched Helen with great admira tion, and no suspicion that her own graceful, diffident manners might be more generally popular. ' We are to go in to dinner without waiting for Mr. O'Brien,' Lady Cecilia explained;"], [159, "RENUNCIATION. 151 ' he begged that it might be so, as the train was late, and he has only just arrived.' \u2022 Rather hard on a man who has come straight out of the Indian forests to have to rush into the fetters of evening dress,' observed Mr. Wray to Henry Mertoun, who appeared to him the only person present likely to sym pathise in such a grievance. ' I hope that O'Brien is sufficiently loyal to his friends to make the sacrifice cheerfully,' replied Henry, ' it has been a great pleasure to me to come here to meet him this evening.' ' His friends ? ' repeated Mr. Wray : ' except yourself, there is not a soul here to night with whom he has anything in common.' ' Myself and my sister Helen.

Helen heard, and profited by this benevolent purpose, Avhich it Avas the more easy to execute since she entered the dining-room last as the most insignificant person of the com pany ; and gratitude prompted her to exempt Mr. Wray from her sweeping condemnation of the Rae family, and especially since, as she reflected, he spelled his name Avith a W.

' You cannot be more surprised to see me here than I am myself,' said Helen : 'if any one had told us two years ago that we should meet again, almost like strangers, and at Lady Cecilia Wray's house of all places in the world, I should have derided the prediction.' ' Turn fortune, turn thy wheel,' rejoined Dennis : ' I daresay that she has stranger re volutions in store for us.' ' When I look back to all our buried projects, I feel that we have been only children digging in the sand,' resumed Helen, ' it is since you went away that I have dis covered that the pursuit of beetles -will not satisfy all my aspirations, although it may serve as the by-play of life.' ' That is fickleness indeed,' said Dennis smiling. ' The intensely technical tone of"], [162, "154 VANESSA. your correspondence conveyed a different impression, and I have thought of returning the series to you Avith the suggestion of publishing it in the Entomological Journal.' 'Were my letters so dull?' said Helen, evidently piqued. ' I did not say dull, only instructive. I confess that I sometimes Avished for informa- tion on matters of more human interest' ' I never forgot to tell you of my visits to Allerton, and the cottage,' said Helen. ' No : you proved yourself to be a true woman by throwing all the interest of your letters into the postscript. How is Mrs. Mertoun?'

' And is that to be your mission in life ? ' ' Unless Eva finds a more efficient prop : she must lean on someone,' said Helen. They went on to talk of O'Brien's Indian experiences, and Helen asked what was to be his next move. ' I have a good deal to wind up before it is necessary to decide,' said Dennis : ' all my cases of insects and botanical specimens are coming to Bixley, and it will take me some time to classify the collection. I shall go back to my old quarters at Mrs. Ball's if she has a vacant room.'

Helen was very silent during the drive home, taking no part in the discussion between Henry and his cousin as to the change Avhich had taken place in O'Brien's looks and manners. Henry observed that he was quite as pleasant, but not quite so unreserved as formerly : he fancied that he Avould thaAV in a tete-a-tete, and readily ac cepted Eva's invitation to luncheon, provided his uncle Richard could spare him.

When there, hoAvever, she was in no haste to go to bed, but sat doAvn by the open AvindoAV to allow the soft air of the summer night to play round her heated temples. A great struggle was going on in her breast, caused by the discovery that the pleasant relations of tutor and pupil Avhich had subsisted betAveen Dennis O'Brien and herself Avere now exchanged for a softer sentiment, on her side certainly, and possibly on his ; and that it Avould be impossible for them to meet on the old familiar terms, Avithout revealing the truth.

Amy, gentler, more lovable, and no less lovely than she had been in those early days, would unquestion ably win back O'Brien's allegiance if they were brought in contact, and Helen was filled with an indignant sense of her own baseness in hesitating as to the sacrifice required of her. ' If I cannot fight, I can fly,' she thought : ' I will go out into the world, away from this idle, pleasure-seeking life, Avhich dulls all the nobler instincts.

Helen's resolution was taken, cemented by tears in the sleepless Avatches of the night, and executed Avith characteristic promptitude. Eva was startled by her early appearance by her bedside, prepared for a journey.

' I did not knoAv that you thought of going there to-day,' said Eva. ' I did not knoAv it myself last night' ' Then you have some bad news,' said Eva, starting up in sudden alarm, but Helen laughed at her fears. ' You have not the heart of a mouse, Eva.

' Since they do not expect you, you may as well put off your visit till to-morrow : you forget that Mr. O'Brien is coming to luncheon.' ' I do not forget, but Henry is coming to' entertain him. Good-bye, Eva : if I do not appear by the six o'clock train, you will know that I have settled to sleep at the cottage. There was a Avistful reproach in Eva's eyes- Avhich recalled Helen after she had reached1 the door, and she returned to give her cousin another and a Avarmer kiss : ' good-bye my little Evie : do not vex your soul about me, for it is all perfectly right' And again she turned aAvay in haste, lest Eva should see the tears Avhich strangled further speech.

It did not transpire Avhy the animal was kept at all under such circum stances, but Amy accepted the office of exer cising it with a good grace, and every after noon the pony and carriage, with suspiciously neAv harness, and a whip which Avas better adapted for a lady's fingers than for those of its professed OAvner, was to be seen at the garden-gate.

She will be dismayed at first, and so perhaps will Uncle Richard, but I have quite made up my mind.' ' And this is what you call discussing the matter,' said Amy smiling : ' I do think that Uncle Richard's kindness to us all entitles him to be consulted before you take any rash step.'

NEVERMORE. Helen's determination to exchange the luxurious ease of her position at Leasowes for the drudgery of governess life was flung like a shell into the midst of the Mertoun family. Eva was the most distressed, Henry the most indignant, and Richard Mertoun, after the first moment of irritation, was shreAvd enough to see that her estrangement from Eva might further the project Avhich he had at heart. ' Give her her head,' he said, Avhen Henry urged him to exert the authority of a guardian : 'after lording it over us as she has done here she Avill not find her first step on the road to independence as easy as she thinks, and Ave"], [177, "NEVERMORE. 169 shall have her back in six months quite content with domestic life at LeasoAves, or the cottage.' Mr. Mertoun left his daughter and Henry to continue the discussion, and Eva turned back to the letter in Avhich Helen announced her resolution : \u2014 ' Since Helen always says Avhat she thinks, I must believe her Avhen she says that we must continue to be equally dear to each other ; and yet I doubt Avhether she would have decided to go away unless I had in some Avay failed to satisfy her.' ' You may be sure that the cause is to be found in her OAvn restless nature,' replied Henry, ' or that she is inspired by a desire to vindicate her consistency in O'Brien's eyes. He told me that she seemed to regret the old Allerton days, Avhen Ave three used to glorify our self-reliance.' ' It is Helen's desire to be consistent which"], [178, "170 VANESSA. has given nobility to her character,' said Eva. ' There is no true consistency in clinging to crude theories Avhich will not hold water. I am not ashamed of having abandoned them Avhen I accepted the hand Avhich my uncle held out to me, and I hope, Eva, that you are not ashamed of me.'

' It Avas only a sacrifice because I Avas eaten up by an over-Aveening sense of my own im portance, and that is, as I take it, the con straining motive of Helen's desire to shake herself free of family ties.'

Although none of her family would countenance her project, she did not alloAv it to cause any open breach betAveen them ; and set about her inquiries in a practical manner, sending her name to two governess institutions and advertising for a situation, Avith due mention of the mastery of modern languages Avhich she had obtained in the course of her residence abroad. She staid on at Charlton, where the opposition to her wishes had taken a less aggressive form than it had done at Leasowes. Mrs. Mertoun had always admitted her children's right to make themselves happy in their OAvn Avay ; and Amy, after she had remarked that Helen's way was more likely to end in dis appointment, AvithdreAV any further objections. Miss Charlton adduced Lady Alan Rae's"], [180, "172 VANESSA. acquiescence as a fresh instance of her singular SAveetness of temper, for all confusion of classes was annoying, and the contrast be tAveen her OAvn exalted rank and her sister's position as a governess Avas painful to con template. ' I doubt Avhether Lady Alan thinks as much of her title as you do,' said George Charlton, rather gruffly : ' from Avhat she said to me the other day, I fancy that she Avould be glad enough to drop it' ' Ah, indeed ! ' said Miss Charlton, thought- fully. Her brother George Avas not of a very susceptible nature, and she had never had cause to feel uneasy about the security of her position at the Manor farm, since that little episode Avith the dairy-maid had been care fully suppressed from her, together Avith other youthful follies : noAv that it crossed her mind that she might be called upon to abdicate in"], [181, "NEVERMORE. 173 favour of a young wife, she was too loyal, both to her friends and to her brother, to allow the suspicion to alter the cordiality of her relations Avith Mrs. Mertoun and her daughters.

Dennis O'Brien did not come, and Helen had been at Charlton for a fortnight before she learned from one of Eva's letters that he had been summoned to London on the very day she left LeasoAves, to help his chief in drawing up the report of the Himalayan expedition, and that he had not as yet returned to Bixley."], [182, "A'ANESSA. 174 It Avas about this time that one of the nego tiations into which Helen had entered was croAvned Avith success.

Amy's simple statement that Dennis had spent an afternoon with them, and that he Avas looking very well, had left a good deal to the imagination ; and, since Helen's imagination Avas lively, she decided that they had come to a happy understanding, and that a formal declaration of the engagement Avas only deferred until Amy had completed her two years of widow hood.

' I am afraid that you are feeling dull, Eva,' said he. ' Shall we send the carriage over for Amy, and ask her to spend a few days with you ? ' ' No, thank you, papa. I did ask her here last week, but she evidently dislikes the idea of coming. Perhaps she is afraid to venture within the range of Lady Cecilia's critical eyes, who might discover something in her mourning or her manners inconsistent with the respect due to the Rae family.

On the strength of this assurance Eva ordered a particularly elaborate little dinner ; but as she first cried until her eyes were red, and then had to wait until they recovered their normal appearance, it Avas some time before she was able to see Misbourne to give the order. When the hour for closing the office ap proached, Mr. Mertoun proposed that Henry should walk up Avith him to LeasoAves ; but Henry replied that he had work to do which must oblige him to spend the evening at his lodgings.

I suppose that you have done nothing to be ashamed of.' ' Yes, I have,' said Henry, fiercely. I cannot go on meeting Eva day after day Avithout making a fool of myself ; and I have made up my mind to decline your offer of taking me into the business as a junior partner, and to look out for a clerkship some where abroad.'

If the doubt really existed, it Avas solved before many hours Avere over. Henry had still to protest that his poverty, and the neces sity of supporting his mother and sister, must preclude any thoughts of marriage ; but such objections were soon set aside, and it only re mained that he should hear his fate from Eva's own lips.

Eva wished now that one or two of the courses had been spared, for, Avhile Mr. Mertoun praised the vol-au-vent and criticised the flavour of the salmon, Henry's appetite was not better than her own.

Henry was"], [208, "200 VANESSA. almost equally agitated, and it was in an un steady voice that the first avowal was made. ' My uncle has been very good to me, Eva, he has permitted me to ask a question which I have been on the point of asking a hundred times Avithout permission.' The question was not asked after all, yet the ansAver Avas given when Eva allowed her cousin to clasp her little, trembling hand, and cover it with kisses. ' Do you really care for such a poor silly thing as I am ? ' asked Eva ; and when that doubt was satisfied, she said playfully, yet not without a secret anxiety, ' I have an uneasy suspicion that papa has arranged it all. When I look back through the vista of years to babyhood, I do not re member an unreasonable Avish Avhich he has not tried to gratify \u2014 all but one,' she added, with a sort of sigh of relief, for on the only occasion when Mr. Mertoun had thwarted"], [209, "HELEN SUPPLANTED. 201 her inclination, he forbade her to think more of Alan Rae. ' In one sense Uncle Richard has arranged it all,' replied Henry, 'for I still wonder at my own presumption in thinking myself worthy of you, but it is two years since I de termined never to marry unless I Avere in a position to ask you to be my Avife.

Eva Avas satisfied that she Avas not only a living chattel to be made over to Henry Avith other privileges of partnership ; but she did not object to hear the assurance repeated once or twice that love for her had been the constraining motive of all his actions, and that he had cherished the hope of calling her his OAvn long before such a possibility had presented itself to her mind. ' What will Helen say to our engagement ?' Henry asked presently. ' Oh, Helen will be delighted,' said Eva, so confidently that he was inclined to accuse her of having obtained his sister's sanction before giving him any encouragement. Helen was delighted, and her delight took the form of a great hunger of home-sickness. 0( O It Avas only a slight relief to her feelings to"], [211, "HELEN SUPPLANTED. 203 express her enthusiastic approval in a letter to the pair of lovers, for she Avas convinced that they Avere too happy in each other to value her sympathy; and she pictured to herself their wanderings through the gardens and shrubbery of Leasowes in these last bright days of September, without a thought to bestOAv on the absent. When the news first reached her she felt the imperative need of imparting it to some one, and her choice fell upon Fanny, as the most intelligent of her two pupils ; but she would have obtained nearly as much satisfaction if she had fol- loAved the example of King Midas, and whispered her secret to the reeds. Fanny opened her round eyes, and said, ' It seems so odd for cousins to marry ; one Avould not feel really married, without changing one's name.'

Such an objection rather conduced to the maintenance of harmony, since the less Mr. Mertoun saAv of his sister-in-law the better he was likely to"], [216, "208 VANESSA. agree Avith her : their natures were uncon genial, and he Avas accustomed to declare that she had no more mind than a piece of blotting-paper Avhich had imbibed, and re tained, her husband's mistaken impressions.

She Avished to see Miss Charlton, of Avhom Helen had talked so much, and asked Amy to Avalk Avith her to the farm, and on the way she still spoke of Henry, and of her father's affection for him. ' I hope, Amy,' she added, ' that you will go and stay at LeasoAves for a few days at a time Avhile Ave are abroad. He had Henry to keep him company Avhen Helen and I were aAvay before.'

They had reached the farm, and the dis cussion which had been interrupted was not again reneAved ; but Eva's words had made an impression, although not in the precise direction in which they Avere aimed.

She was true to the instinct of the butterfly nature which O'Brien had once ascribed to her in one particular, for she could only expand in the sunshine of approval, and she began to think that if she were able to requite his loyal and true-hearted affection as it deserved, she might still regain her peace of mind. Mr. Charlton was not intellectual, he Avas fully twenty years her senior, and his yeoman extraction was glozed over by no outAvard refinements of dress and breeding.

With a happy inspiration of audacity he proposed that they should turn into the orchard, instead of keeping to the church path Avhich crossed the meadoAVS surrounding the Manor farm. The gnarled and tAvisted trees, laden with their wealth of autumn fruit and standing knee-deep in herbage, were the pride of George's heart, but he only thought at that moment of the way in which his material possessions might serve to further his suit to the Avoman Avhom he loved.

' said Amy, and if the smile came, it was through a shower of tears ; ' the woman who is rich in your love will look for nothing more.' The tone in Avhich Amy pronounced his name, the confiding gesture with which she slipped her hand Avithin his arm, left little room for doubt, and yet George could scarcely trust the evidence of his senses.

The very labourers on the estate knew that their master was courting ; and hoped that a young mistress might make him, and them, as comfortable as Miss Charlton had done. At Leasowes, however, where the other pair of lovers were absorbed in each other, there was no surmise of the truth ; and Helen was the last person who was likely to be informed of it, since Amy was sensitive to her sister's criticism, and believed that Helen might note, with a surprise bordering on con tempt, the very brief interval which had"], [224, "216 VANESSA. elapsed between her acceptation of the fact of O'Brien's indifference, and her encouragement of George Charlton's addresses. Helen herself Avas at this time embroiled in an affair which did not leave her mind disen- gaged for the consideration of her family concerns. There was a certain Uncle Edmund whose name was continually turning up in the Wentworth school-room and Avho was an object of interest to his nephews and nieces for several reasons. In the first place he was ever so many years younger than their mother, and comparative youth was a decided point in his favour, and then he was very good looking, rich, and open-handed. ' He is always good for a tip,' as the school boys repeated, without the slightest compunc tion, even after Helen had reviled their mercenary spirit. The young ladies cast a veil over their expectations, but they took pleasure in exhibiting the trinkets Avhich their"], [225, "CONSTANCY. 2 1 J uncle had presented to them, and took care to wear the prettiest among them on the day of his arrival at Earlston. Fanny came into the school-room when Helen was sitting alone that evening, to ask for her collection of dried flowers, as she wished to show it to her uncle Edmund, who took an interest in botany. The same request had been made on a former occasion, and Helen acceded to it without hesitation. Fanny came in to restore the portfolio on her way to bed, and lingered for a moment to say with an air of curiosity : ' Uncle Edmund was very much interested in the collection, and especially in the Swiss flowers, as he has travelled so much in Switzerland himself. He says that he has made a memorandum on the sheet which has a bit of edelweiss fastened on it, which you will understand.' Helen showed no disin clination to gratify Fanny's curiosity, for she turned to the page in question while she was"], [226, "218 VANESSA. still speaking. Her colour rose as she read the words, ' Picked by E. H., August 17,' and she took up a pen-knife and deliberately erased the inscription before Fanny's eyes had been quick enough to read it. ' What did you say was your uncle's name ? ' said Helen. ' Horton : Edmund Horton. You know that he is only mamma's half-brother.' ' Well : you can tell Mr. Horton hoAV I have served his memorandum if he asks about it to-morrow. I do not allow any one to make notes on my collection except myself.

Such a step seemed to attach too much Aveight to an act of boyish folly, and might expose her to the imputation of running away to avoid a declaration of love which Avould never have been repeated. She resolved to rely on the weapons of her own discretion to avert any unseasonable display of constancy, and not to recognise their previous acquaintance if it were possible to avoid it. Although Edmund Horton was not addicted to early hours, he came down in excellent time for family prayers that morning; but Helen and her two pupils only came in with the servants, and disappeared by the same door.

' Including my apparent want of candour,' retorted Helen. Mrs. WentAvorth wisely held her peace, and in a few moment's Helen's irritation had subsided, and she apo logised for it with characteristic frankness.

' I do not think that I have done anything to forfeit that opinion, Mrs. WentAvorth, and I shall always remember your kindness ; but I suspect that the girls will ' be happier, and may even learn more, Avith some hum-drum, conventional teacher, Avho has never gone * O off the beaten track.'

Before her packing Avas concluded, Helen found it necessary to return to the school room, since Fanny Avas receiving hard mea sure from her brothers, Tom and Alfred.

' I kneAV that it Avould surprise you very much, Helen, and I did not mean to tell you just yet. But you must not think that I am ashamed of the engagement.

When they spoke of LeasoAves, she found it easier to ask her mother than Amy Avhether they had seen anything of Dennis. ' Not since he came over here, the very day you left us. He still has his lodgings in Bixley, but Dick, Avho was here yesterday, says that he has been going to and fro to London ; and Henry told us that he Avas a good deal altered, so reserved and almost morose."], [255, "A REVELATION. 247 * I suspect that Henry is too much absorbed in his courtship to see much of him,' said Amy, ' I am sure, mamma, that you thought him quite as frank and pleasant as ever.'

Helen accepted this interpretation of O'Brien's state of mind Avith equanimity, perhaps because she did not rely implicitly on her mother's discernment. ' Before I settle doAvn here,' she said, ' I must pay a visit to Leasowes. I want so much to see Eva again.'

Helen Avas in the highest spirits, and it Avas evident that if she had been subjected to any slights and mortification at Earlston they did not Aveigh heavily on her mind. The little veil of reserve Avhich had been cast over Amy's engagement did not resist the influence of her frankness, and before the evening was over, all their plans for the future had been freely discussed ; but Helen, Avith the secret conviction that Miss Charlton's constant com- panionship Avould be more acceptable than her OAvn, declined to abandon all intention of going out again as a governess, until she had OOO O talked over the matter Avith Henry. She went to LeasoAves on the folloAving day, giving"], [257, "A REVELATION. 249 notice of her intention, and Eva met her at the station.

' I shall be glad to see Dick,' said Helen : her sentiments about the other guest were not expressed. At LeasoAves there were the old servants to greet, Avith Avhom Helen Avas an especial favourite, the Avedding-presents to admire, and the half-finished trousseau to inspect, and Henry came in Avith his uncle an hour before dinner.
