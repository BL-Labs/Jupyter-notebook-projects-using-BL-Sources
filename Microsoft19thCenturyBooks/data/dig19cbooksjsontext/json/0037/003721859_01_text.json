Sir : I have the honor to submit herein the official report of the operations of the army of the Potomac while under my charge. Accompanying it are the reports of the corps, division, and subordinate commanders, pertaining to the various engagements, battles, and occurrences of the campaigns, and important documents connected with its organization, supply, and movements. These, with lists of maps and memoranda submitted, will be found appended, duly arranged, and marked for convenient reference. Charged, in the spring of 1861, with the operations in the department of the Ohio, which included the States of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and latterly Western Virginia, it had become my duty to counteract the hostile designs of the enemy in Western Virginia, which were immediately directed to the destruction of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad and the possession of the Kanawha valley, with the ultimate object of gaining Wheeling and the control of the Ohio river. The successful affairs of Phillippi, Rich Mountain, Carrick's Ford, &c, had been fought, and I had acquired possession of all Western Virginia north of the Kanawha valley, as well as of the lower portion of that valley. I had determined to proceed to the relief of the upper Kanawha valley, as soon as provision was made for the permanent defence of the mountain passes leading from the east into the region under control, when I received at Beverly, in Randolph county, on the 21st of July, 1861, intelligence of the unfortunate result of the battle of Manassas, fought on that day. On the 22d I received an order by telegraph, directing me to turn over my command to Brigadier General Rosecrans, and repair at once to Washington. I had already caused reconnoissances to be made for intrenchments at the Cheat Mountain pass ; also on the Hunterville road, near Elkwater, and at Red House, near the main road from Romney to Grafton. During the afternoon and night of the 22d I gave the final instructions for the construction of these works, turned over the command to Brigadier General Rosecrans, and started, on the morning of the 23d, for Washington, arriving there on the afternoon of the 26th. On the 27th I assumed command of the division of the Potomac, comprising the troops in and around Washington, on both banks of the river. With this brief statement of the events which immediately preceded my being called to the command of the troops at Washington, I proceed to an account, from such authentic data as are at hand, of my military operations while com mander of the army of the Potomac. The subjects to be considered naturally arrange themselves as follows : The organization of the army of the Potomac. The military events con nected \"with the defence; of Washington, from July, 1861, to March, 1862. The campaign on the Penin.-ula, and that in Maryland. The great resources aud capacity for powerful resistance of the south at the breaking out of the rebellion, and the full proportions of the great conflict about to take place, were sought to be carefully measured ; and 1 had also endeavored, by every means in my power, to impress upon the authorities the necessity for"], [11, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 3 such immediate and full preparation as alone would enable the government to prosecute the war on a scale commensurate with the resistance to be offered. On the fourth of August, 1861, I addressed to the President the following memorandum, prepared at his request : MEMORANDUM. The object of the present war differs from those in which nations are engaged, mainly in this : that the purpose of ordinary war is to conquer a peace, and make a treaty on advantageous terms ; in this contest it has become necessary to crush a population sufficiently numerous, intelligent and warlike to constitute a nation. We have not only to defeat their armed and organized forces in the field, but to display such an overwhelming strength as will convince all our an tagonists, especially those of the governing, aristocratic class, of the utter im possibility of resistance. Our late reverses make this course imperative. Had we been successful in the recent battle, (Manassas.) it is possible that we might have been spared the labor and expenses of a great effort. Now we have no alternative. Their success will enable the political leaders of the rebels to convince the mass of their people that we are inferior to them in force and courage, and to command all their resources. The contest began with a class, now it is with a people \u2014 our military success can alone restore the former issue. By thoroughly defeating their armies, taking their strong places, and pursuing a rigidly protective policy as to private property and unarmed persons, and a lenient course as to private soldiers, we may well hope for a permanent restora tion of a peaceful Union. But in the first instance the authority of the gov ernment must be supported by overwhelming physical force. Our foreign relations and financial credit also imperatively demand that the military action of the government should be prompt aud irresistible. The rebels have chosen Virginia as their battle-field, and it seems proper for us to make the first great struggle there. But while thus directing our main efforts, it is necessary to diminish the resistance there offered us, by movements on other points both by land and water. Without entering at present into details, I would advise that a strong move ment be made on the Mississippi, and that the rebels be driven out of Missouri. As soon as it becomes perfectly clear that Kentucky is cordially united with us, I would advise a movement through that State into Eastern Tennessee, for the purpose of assisting the Union men of that region and of seizing the rail roads leading from Memphis to the east. The possession of those roads by us, in connexion with the movement on the Mississippi, would go far towards determining the evacuation of Virginia by the rebels. In the mean time all the passes into Western Virginia from the east should be securely guarded, but I would advise no movement from that quarter towards Richmond, unless the political condition of Kentucky renders it impossible or inexpedient for us to make the movement upon Eastern Ten nessee through that State. Every effort should, however, be made to organize, equip and arm as many troops as possible in Western Virginia, in order to render the Ohio and Indiana regiments available for other operations. At as early a day as practicable, it would be well to protect and re-open the Baltimore and Ohio railroad. Baltimore and Fort Monroe should be occupied by garrisons sufficient to retain them in our possession. The importance of Harper's Ferry and the line of the PStomac in the direction of Leesburg will be very materially diminished so soon as our force in this vicinity becomes organized, strong and efficient, because no capable general will cross the river north of this city, when we have a strong army here ready to cut off his retreat."], [12, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 4 To revert to the west. It is probable that no very large additions to the troops now in Missouri will be necessary to secure that State. .... I presume that the force required for the movement down the Mississippi will be determined by its commander and the President. If Kentucky assumes the right position, not more than 20,000 will be needed, together with those that can be raised in that State and Eastern Tennessee, to secure the latter region and its railroads, as well as ultimately to occupy Nashville. The Western Virginia troops, with not more than five to ten thousand from Ohio and Indiana, should, under proper management, suffice for its protection. When we have re-organized our main army here, 10,000 men ought to be enough to protect the Baltimore and Ohio railroad and the Potomac, 5,000 will garrison Baltimore, 3,000 Fort Monroe, and not more than 20,000 will be necessary at the utmost for the defence of Washington. For the main army of operations I urge the following composition : 250 regiments 'of infantry, say 225, 000 men. 100 field batteries, 600 guns 15, 000 \" 2S regiments of cavalry 25, 500 \" 5 regiments engineer troops 7, 500 Total 273,000 \" The force must be supplied with the necessary engineer and pontoon trains, and with transportation for everything save tents. Its general line of opera tions should be so directed that water transportation can be availed of from point to point, by means of the ocean and the rivers emptying into it. An essential feature of the plan of operations will be the employment of a strong naval force to protect the movement of a fleet of transports intended to convey a considerable body of troops from point to point of the enemy's sea-coast, thus either creating diversions and rendering it necessary for them to detach largely from their main body in order to protect such of their cities as may be threatened, or else landing and forming establishments on their coast at any favorable places that opportunity might offer. This naval force should also co-operate with the main army in its efforts to seize the important seaboard towns of the rebels. It cannot be ignored that the construction of railroads has introduced a new and very important element into war, by the great facilities thus given for concentrating at particular positions large masses of troops from remote sections, and by creating new strategic points and lines of operations. It is intended to overcome this difficulty by the partial operations suggested, and such others as the particular case may require. We must endeavor to seize places on the railways in the rear of the enemy's points of concentration, and we must threaten their seaboard cities, in order that each State may be forced, by the necessity of its own defence, to diminish its contingent to the confederate army. The proposed movement down the Mississippi will produce important results in this connexion. That advance and the progress of the main army at the east will materially assist each other by diminishing the resistance to be encountered by each. The tendency of the Mississippi movement upon all questions connected with cotton is too well understood by the President and cabinet to need any illustration from me. There is another independent movement that has often been suggested and which has always recommended itself to my judgment. I refer to a movement from Kansas and Nebraska through the Indian territory upon Red river"], [13, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 5 and. western Texas for the purpose of protecting and developing the latent Union and free-State sentiment well known to predominate in western Texas, and which, like a similar sentiment in Western Virginia, will, if protected, ultimately organize that section into a free State. How far it will be possible to support this movement by an advance through New Mexico from California, is a matter which I have not sufficiently examined to be able to express a decided opinion. If at all practicable, it is eminently desirable, as bringing into play the resources and warlike qualities of the Pacific States, as well as identifying them with our cause and connecting the bond of Union between them and the general government. If it is not departing too far from my province, I will venture to suggest the policy of an ultimate alliance and cordial understanding with Mexico ; their sympathies and interests are with us \u2014 their antipathies exclusively against our enemies and their institutions. I think it would not be difficult to obtain from the Mexican government the right to use, at least during the present contest, the road from Guaymas to New Mexico; this aoncession would very materially reduce the obstacles of the column moving from the Pacific ; a similar permis sion to use their territory for the passage of troops between the Panuco and the Rio Grande would enable us to throw a column of troops by a good road from Tampico, or some of the small harbors north of it, upon and across the Rio Grande, without risk and scarcely siring a shot. To what extent, if any, it would be desirable to take into service and employ Mexican soldiers, is a question entirely political, on which I do not venture to offer an opinion. The force I have recommended is large; the expense is great. It is possible that a smaller force might accomplish the object in view, but I understand it to be the purpose of this great nation to re-establish the power of its government, and restore peace to its citizens, in the shortest possible time. The question to be decided is simply this : shall we crush the rebellion at one blow, terminate the war in one compaign, or shall we leave it as a legacy for our descendants? When the extent of the possible line of operations is considered, the force asked for for the, main army under my command cannot be regarded as unduly large; every mile we advauce carries us further from our base of operations and renders detachments necessary to cover our communications, while the enemy will be constantly concentrating as he falls back. I propose, with the force which I have requested, not only to drive the enemy out of Virginia and occupy Richmond, but to occupy Charleston, Savannah, Montgomery, Pensacola, Mobile and New Orleans; in other words, to move into the heart of the enemy's coun try and crush the rebellion in its very heart. By seizing and repairing the railroads as we advance, the difficulties of trans portation will be materially diminished. It is perhaps unnecessary to state that, in addition to the forces named in this memorandum, strong reserves should be formed, ready to supply any losses that may occur. In conclusion, I would submit that the exigencies of the treasury may be lessened by making only partial payments to our troops, when in the enemy's country, and by giving the obligations of the United States for such supplies as may there be obtained. GEO. B. McCLELLAN, Major General. I do not think the events of the war have proved these views upon the method and plans of its conduct altogether incorrect. They certainly have not proved my estimate of the number of troops and scope of operations too large. It is probable that I did underestimate the time necessary for the completion of arms and equipments. It was not strange, however, that by many civilians"], [14, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 6 intrusted with authority there should have been an exactly opposite opinion held on both these particulars. The result of the first battle of Manassas had been almost to destroy the morale and organization of our army, and to alarm government and people. The national capital was in danger; it was necessary, besides holding the enemy in check, to build works for its defence, strong and capable of being held by a small force. , It was necessary also to create a new army for active operations and to expedite its organization, equipment, and the accumulation of the material ot war, and to this not inconsiderable labor all my energies for the next three months were constantly devoted. Time is a necessary element in the creation of armies, and I do not, therefore, think it necessary to more than mention the impatience with which many re garded the delay in the arrival of new levies, though recruited and pressed forward with unexampled rapidity, the manufacture and supply of arms and equipments, or the vehemence with which an immediate advance upon the enemy's works directly in our front was urged by a patriotic but sanguine people. The President, too, was anxious for the speedy employment of our army, and, although possessed of my plans through frequent conferences, desired a paper from me upon the condition of the forces under my command and the immediate measures to be taken to increase their efficiency. Accordingly, in the latter part of October I addressed the following letter to the Secretary of War : Sir: In conformity with a personal understanding with the President yes terday, I have the honor to submit the following statement of the condition of the army under my command, and the measures required for the preservation of the government and the suppression of the rebellion. It will be remembered that in a memorial I had the honor to address to the President soon after my arrival in Washington, and in my communication addressed to Lieutenant General Scott, under date of 8th of August ; in my letter to the President authorizing him, at his request, to withdraw the letter written by me to General Scott; and in my letter of the 8th of September, an swering your note of inquiry of that date, my views on the same subject are frankly and fully expressed. In these several communications I have stated the force I regarded as neces sary to enable this army to advance with a reasonable certainty of success, at the same time leaving the capital and the line of the Potomac sufficiently guarded, not only to secure the retreat of the main army, in the event of disaster, but to render it out of the enemy's power to attempt a diversion in Maryland. So much time has passed, and the winter is approaching so rapidly, that but two courses are left to the government, viz., either to go into winter quarters, or to assume the offensive with forces greatly inferior in numbers to the army I regarded as desirable and necessary. If political considerations render the first course unadvisable, the second alone remains. While I regret that it has not been deemed expedient, or perhaps possible, to concentrate the forces of the nation in this vicinity, (remaining on the defensive elsewhere,) keeping the attention and efforts of the government fixed upon this as the vital point, where the issue of the great contest is to be decided, it may still be that, by introducing unity of action and design among the various armies of the land, by deter mining the courses to be pursued by the various commanders under one general plan, transferring from the other armies the superfluous strength not required for the purpose in view, and thus re-enforcing this main army, whose destiny it is to decide the controversy, we may yet be able to move with a reasonable prospect of success before the winter is fairly upon us."], [15, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 7 The nation feels, and I share that feeling, that the army of the Potomac holds the fate of the country in its hands. The stake is so vast, the issue so momentous, and the effect of the next battle will be so important throughout the future, as well as the present, that I con tinue to urge, as I have ever done since I entered upon the command of this army, upon the government to devote its energies and its available resources to wards increasing the numbers and efficiency of the army on which its salvation depends. A statement, carefully prepared by the chiefs of engineers and artillery of this aimy, gives us the necessary garrison of this city and its fortifications, 33,795 men \u2014 say 35,000. The present garrison of Baltimore and its dependencies is about 10,000. I have sent the chief of my staff to make a careful examination into the condition of these troops, and to obtain the information requisite to enable me to decide whether this number can be diminished, or the reverse. At least 5,000 men will be required to watch the river hence to Harper's Ferry and its vicinity; probably 8,000 to guard the lower Potomac. As you are aware, all the information we have from spies, prisoners, &c, agrees in showing that the enemy have a force on the Potomac not less than 150,000 strong, well drilled aud equipped, ably commanded and strongly in trenched. It is plain, therefore, that to insure success, or to render it reasona bly certain, the active army should not number less than 150,000 efficient troops, with 400 guns, unless some material change occurs in the force in front of us. The requisite force for an advance movement by the army of the Potomac may be thus estimated: Column of active operations 150,000 men, 400 guns. Garrison of the city of Washington 35,000 \" 40 \" To guard the Potomac to Harper's Ferry 5,000 \" 12 \" To guard the lower Potomac 8,000 \" 24 \" Garrison for Baltimore aud Annapolis 10,000 \" 12 \" Total effective force required 208,000 men, 488 guns, or an aggregate, present and absent, of about 240,000 men, should the losses by sickness, &c, not rise to a higher per-centage than at present. Having stated what I regard as the requisite force to enable this army to advance, I now proceed to give the actual strength of the army of the Potomac. The aggregate strength of the army of the Potomac, by the official report on the morning of the 27th instant, was 168,318 officers and men, of all grades and arms. This includes the troops at Baltimore and Annapolis, on the upper and lower Potomac, the sick, absent, &c. The force present for duty was 147,695. Of this number, 4,268 cavalry were completely unarmed, 3,163 cavalry only partially armed, 5,979 infantry unequipped, making 13,410 unfit for the field, (irrespective of those not yet sufficiently drilled,) and reducing the effective force to 134,285, and the number disposable for an* advance to 76,285. The infantry regiments are, to a consid- erable extent, armed with unserviceable weapons. Quite a large number of good arms, which had been intended for this army, were ordered elsewhere, leaving the army of the Potomac insufficiently, and, in some cases, badly armed. On the 30th of September there were with this army 228 field guns ready for the field; so far as arms and equipments are concerned, some of the batte- ries are still quite raw, and unfit to go into action. I have intelligence that eight New York batteries are en route hither ; two others are ready for the field. I will still (if the New York batteries have six guns each) be 112 guns short of the number required for the active column, saying nothing, for the present, of"], [16, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 8 those necessary for the garrisons and corps on the Potomac, which would make a total deficiency of 200 guns. I have thus briefly stated our present condition and wants ; it remains to sug gest the means of supplying the deficiencies. First, that all the cavalry and infantry arms, as fast as procured, whether manufactured in this country or purchased abroad, be sent to this army until is fully prepared for the field. Second, that the two companies of the fourth artillery, now understood to be en route from Fort Randall to Fort Monroe, be ordered to this army, to be mounted at once; also, that the companies of the third artillery, en route from California, be sent here. Had not the order for Smead's battery to come here from Harrisburg, to replace the battery I gave General Sherman, been so often countermanded, I would again ask for it. Third, that a more effective regulation may be made authorizing the transfer of men from the volunteers to the regular batteries, infantry and cavalry; that we may make the best possible use of the invaluable regular \"skeletons.\" Fourth, I have no official information as to the United States forces elsewhere, but, from the best information I can obtain from the War Department and other sources, I am led to believe that the United States troops are : In Western Virginia, about 30,000 In Kentucky 40,000 In Missouri 80,000 In Fortress Monroe \u25a0 11.000 Total 161,000 Besides these, I am informed that more than 100,000 are in progress of or ganization in other northern and western States. I would therefore recommend that, not interfering with Kentucky, there should be retained in Western Virginia and Missouri a sufficient force for de fensive purposes, and that the surplus troops be sent to the army of the Poto mac, to enable it to assume the offensive; that the same course be pursued in respect to Fortress Monroe, and that no further outside expeditions be attempted until we have fought the great battle in front of us. Fifth, that every nerve be strained to hasten the enrolment, organization and armament of new batteries and regiments of infantry. Sixth, that all the battalions now raised for new regiments of regular infantry be at once ordered to this army, and that the old infantry and cavalry en route from California be ordered to this army immediately on their arrival in New York. 1 have thus indicated, in a general manner, the objects to be accomplished, and the means by which we may gain our ends. A vigorous employment of these means will, in my opinion, enable the army of the Potomac to assume successfully this season the offensive operations which, ever since entering upon the command, it has been my anxious desire and diligent effort to prepare for and prosecute.\" The advance should not .be post poned beyond the 25th of November, if possible to avoid it. Unity in councils, the utmost vigor and energy in action are indispensable. The entire military field should be grasped as a whole, and not in detached parts. One plan should be agreed upon and. pursued ; a single will should direct aud carry out these plans. The great object to be accomplished, the crushing defeat of the rebel army (now) at Manassas, should never for one instant be lost sight of, but all the in tellect and means and men of the government poured upon that point. The loyal States possess ample force to effect all this and more. The rebels have"], [17, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 9 displayed energy, unanimity, and wisdom worthy of the most desperate days of. the French revolution. Should we do less? The unity of this nation, the preservation of our institutions, are so dear to me that I have willingly sacrificed my private happiness with the single object of doing my duty to my country. When the task is accomplished, I shall be glad to return to the obscurity from which events have drawn me. Whatever the determination of the government may be, I will do the best I can with the army of the Potomac, and will share its fate, whatever may be the task imposed upon me. Permit me to add that, on this occasion as heretofore, it has been my aim neither to exaggerate nor underrate the power of the enemy, nor fail to express clearly the means by which, in my judgment, that power maybe broken. Urging the energy of preparation and action, which has ever been my choice, but with the fixed purpose by no act of mine to expose the government to hazard by premature movement, and requesting that this communication may be laid before the President, I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, G. B. McCLELLAN, Major General. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War. When I assumed command in Washington, on the 27th of July, 1861, the number of troops in and around the city was about 50,000 infantry, less than 1,000 cavalry, and 650 artillerymen, with nine imperfect field batteries of thirty pieces. On the Virginia bank of the Potomac the brigade organization of General McDowell still existed, and the troops were stationed at and in rear of Fort Corcoran, Arlington, and Fort Albany, at Fort Runyon, Roach's Mills, Cole's Mills, and in the vicinity of Fort Ellsworth, with a detachment at the Theologi cal Seminary. There were no troops south of Hunting creek, and many of the regiments were encamped on the low grounds bordering the Potomac, seldom in the best positions for defence, and entirely inadequate in numbers and condition to de fend the long line from Fort Corcoran to Alexandria. On the Maryland side of the river, upon the heights overlooking the Chain bridge, two regiments were stationed, whose commanders were independent of each other. There were no troops on the important Tenallytown road, or on the roads entering the city from the south. The camps were located without regard to purposes of defence or instruction, the roads were not picketed, and there was no attempt at an organization into brigades. In no quarter were the dispositions for defence such as to offer a vigorous resistance to'a respectable body of the enemy, either in the position and num bers of the troops, or the number and character of the defensive works. Earth works, in the nature of tetes de pont, looked upon the approaches to the George town aqueduct and ferry, the Long bridge and Alexandria, by the Little river turnpike, and some simple defensive arrangements were made at the Chain bridge. With the latter exception not a single defensive work had been com menced on the Maryland side. There was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy range, which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without resist ance. Many soldiers had deserted, and the streets of Washington were crowded with straggling officers and men, absent from their stations without authority, whose behavior indicated the general want of discipline and organization."], [18, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 10 I at once designated an effi^iant stiff, afterward? adliug to it as opportunity was afforded and necessity required, who zealously co-operated with me in the labor of bringing order out of confusion, re-assigning troops and commands, pro jecting and throwing up defensive works, receiving and organizing, equipping and providing for the new levies arriving in the city. The valuable services of these officers in their various departments, during this and throughout the subsequent periods of the history of the army of the Potomac, can hardly be sufficiently appreciated. Their names and duties will be given in another part of this report, and they are commended to the favorable notice of the War Department. The restoration of order in the city of Washington was effected through tha appointment of a provost marshal, whose authority was supported by the few regular troops within my command. These troops were thus in position to act as a reserve, to be sent to any point of attack where their services might be most wanted. The energy and ability displayed by Colonel A. Porter, the provost marshal, and his assistants, and the strict discharge of their duty by the troops, produced the best results, and Washington soon became one of the most quiet cities in the Union. The new levies of infantry, upon arriving in Washington, were formed into provisional brigades and placed in camp in the suburbs of the city for equip ment, instruction, and discipline. As soon as regiments were in a fit condition for transfer to the forces across the Potomac, they were assigned to the brigades serving there. Brigadier General F. J. Porter was at first assigned to the charge of the provisional brigades. Brigadier General A. E. Burnside was the next officer assigned this duty, from which, however, he was soon relieved by Brigadier General S. Casey, who continued in charge of the newly arriving regi ments until the army of the Potomac departed for the Peninsula, in March, 1862. The newly arriving artillery troops reported to Brigadier General William F. Barry, the chief of artillery, and the cavalry to Brigadier General George Stone man, the chief of cavalry. By the 15th of October, the number of troops in and about Washington, in clusive of the garrison of the city and Alexandria, the city guard and the forces on the Maryland shore of the Potomac below Washington, and as far as Cum berland above, the troops under the command of General Dix at Baltimore and its dependencies, were as follows : Total present for duty 133, 201 \" sick \u25a0 9,290 \" in confinement 1, 156 Aggregate present 143, 647 \" absent 8, 404 Grand aggregate 152, 051 The following table exhibits similar data for the periods stated, troops in Maryland and Delaware : including the Present.

M'CLELLAN, 11 For convenience of reference the strength of the army of the Potomac at subsequent periods is given. * Including Franklin. t Including McCall and Di J Including two brigades of Shield division absent, 5,354 men. In organizing the army of the Potomac, and preparing it for the field, the first step taken was to organize the infantry into brigades of four regiments each ; retaining the newly arrived regiments on the Maryland side until their armament and equipment were issued and they had obtained some little ele mentary instruction, before assigning them permanently to brigades. When the organization of the brigades was well established, and the troops somewhat disciplined and instructed, divisions of three brigades each were gradually formed, as is elsewhere stated in this report, although I was always in favor of the organization into army corps as an abstract principle. I did not desire to form them until the army had been for some little time in the field, in order to enable the general offices first to acquire the requisite experience as division commanders on active service, and that I might be able to decide from actual trial who were best fitted to exercise these important commands. For a similar reason I carefully abstained from making any recommendations for the promotion of officers to the grade of major general. When new batteries of artillery arrived they also were retained in Washing ton until their armament and equipment were completed, and their instruction sufficiently advanced to justify their being assigned to divisions. The same course was pursued in regard to cavalry. I regret that circumstances have de layed the chief of cavalry, General George Stoneman, in furnishing his report upon the organization of that arm of service. It will, however, be forwarded as soon as completed, and will, doubtless, show that the difficult and important duties intrusted to him were efficiently performed. He encountered and over came, as far as it was possible, continual and vexatious obstacles arising from the great deficiency of cavalry arms aud equipments, and the entire inefficiency of many of the regimental officers first appointed ; this last difficulty was, to a considerable extent, overcome in the cavalry, as well as in the infantry and ar tillery, by the continual and prompt action of courts-martial and boards of ex amination. As rapidly as circumstances permitted, every cavalry soldier was armed with a sabre and revolver, and at least two squadrons in every regiment with car bines. It was intended to assign at least one regiment of cavalry to each division of the active army, besides forming a cavalry reserve of the regular regiments and some picked regiments of volunter cavalry. Circumstances beyond my control rendered it impossible to carry out this intention fully, and the cavalry force serving with the army in the field was never as large as it ought to have been. It was determined to collect the regular infantry to form the nucleus of a re serve. The advantage of such a body of troops at a critical moment, especially in an army constituted mainly of new levies, imperfectly disciplined, has been Date. For duty. Sick. Present.

I have not been disappointed in the estimate formed of the value of these troops. I have always found them to be relied on. Whenever they have been brought under fire they have shown the utmost gallantry and tenacity. The regular infantry, wdiich had been-col lected from distant posts and which had been recruited as rapidly as the slow progress of recruiting for the regular service would allow, added to the small battalion with McDowell's army, which I found at Washington on my arrival, amounted, on the 30th of August, to 1,040 men; on the 28th of February, 1862, to 2,682, and on the 30th of April, to 4,603. On the 17th of May, 1862, they were assigned to General Porter's corps for organization as a division, with the fifth regiment New York volunteers, which joined May 4, and the tenth New York volunteers, which joined subsequently. They remained from the com mencement under the command of Brigadier General George Sykes, major third infantry United States army., ARTILLERY. The creation of an adequate artillery establishment for an army of so large proportions was a formidable undertaking; and had it not been that the country possessed in the regular service a body of accomplished and energetic artillery officers, the task would have been almost hopeless. The charge of organizing this most important arm was confided to Major (afterwards Brigadier General) William F. Barry, chief of artillery, whose in dustry and zeal achieved the best results. The report of General Barry is ap pended among the accompanying doouments. By referring to it, it will be ob served that the following principles were adopted as the basis of organization : \" 1. That the proportion of artillery should be in the proportion of at least two and one-half pieces to 1,000 men, to be expanded, if possible, to three pieces to 1,000 men. \" 2. That the proportion of rifled guns should be restricted to the system of the United States ordnance departments and of Parrott/and the 'smooth bores ' (with the exception of a few howitzers ror special service) to be exclusively the twelve-pounder gun, of the model of 1857, variously called the ' gun-howitzer,' the ' light twelve-pounder,' or the * Napoleon.' \" 3. That each field battery should, if practicable, be composed of six guns, and none to be less than four guns, and in all cases the guns of each battery should be of uniform calibre. \" 4. That the field batteries were to be assigned to divisions, and not to brigades, and in the proportion of four to each division, of which one was to be a battery of regulars, the remainder of volunteers, the captain of the regular battery to be the commandant of artillery of the division. In the event of sev eral divisions constituting an army corps, at least one-half of the divisional ar tillery was to constitute the reserve artillery of the corps. \" 5. That the artillery reserve of the whole army should consist of one hun dred guns, and should comprise, besides a sufficient number of light ' mounted batteries,' all the guns of position, and until the cavalry were massed, all the horse artillery. \" 6. That the amount of ammunition to accompany field batteries was not to be less than four hundred rounds per gun. \" 7. A siege train of fifty pieces. This was subsequently expanded, for special service at the siege of Yorktown, to very nearly one hundred pieces, and com prised the unusual calibres and enormously heavy weight of metal of two 200-pounders, five 100-pounders, and ten 13-inch sea-coast mortars.\" As has been before stated, the chief of artillery reports the whole of the field artillery of the army of the Potomac, July 28, 1861, was comprised of nine im-"], [21, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 13 perfectly equipped batteries, of thirty guns, 650 men, and 400 horses. In March, 1862, when the whole army took the field, it consisted of ninety-two batteries, of 520 guns, 12,500 men, and 11,000 horses, fully equipped and in readiness for active field service ; of the whole force thirty batteries were regulars, and sixty-two batteries volunteers. During the short period of seven months, all of this immense amount of material was issued by the ordnance department and placed in the hands of the artillery troops after their arrival in Washington. About one-fourth of all the volunteer batteries brought with them from their respective States a few guns and carriages, but they 'were nearly all of such pe culiar calibre as to lack uniformity with the more modern and more serviceable ordnance with which the other batteries were armed, and they therefore had to be withdrawn and replaced by more suitable material. While about one-sixth came supplied with horses and harness, less than one-tenth were apparently fully equipped for service when they reported ; and every one of these required the supply of many deficiencies of material, and very extensive instruction in the theory and practice of their special arm. The operations on the Peninsula by the army of the Potomac commenced with a full field artillery force of fifty-two batteries of two hundred and ninety nine guns. To this, must be added the field artillery of Franklin's division of McDowell's corps, which joined a few days before the capture of Yorktown, but was not disembarked from its transports for service until after the battle of Williamsburg, and the field artillery of McCall's division of McDowell's corps, (four batteries, twenty-two guns,) which joined in Jtne, a few days before the battle of Mechanicsville, (June 26, 1862,) making a grand total of field artillery, at any time with the army of the Peninsula, of sixty batteries of three hundred and forty-three guns. With this large force, saving in six corps d'armee of eleven divisions, and the artillery reserve, the only general and 'field officers were ono brigadier general, four colonels, three lieutenant colonels, and three majors, a number obviously insufficient, and which impaired to a great degree, in conse quence of the want of rank and official influence of the commanders of corps and division artillery, the efficiency of the arm. As this faulty organization can be suitably corrected only by legislative action, it is earnestly hoped that the at tention of the proper authorities may be at an early day invited to it. When there were so many newly organized volunteer field batteries, many of whom received their first and only instruction in the intrenched camps covering Washington during the three or four inclement months of the winter of 1861-'62, there was, of course, much to be improved. Many of the volunteer batteries, however, evinced such zeal and intelligence, and availed themselves so indus triously of the instructions of the regular officers, their commanders, and the ex ample of the regular batteries, their associates, that they made rapid progress, and attained a degree of proficiency highly creditable. The designations of the different batteries of artillery, both regular and vol unteer, follow within a few pages. The following distribution of regiments and batteries was made, as a prelim inary organisation of the forces at hand, shortly after my arrival in Washington. The infantry, artillery, and cavalry, as fast as collected and brought into primary organization, were assigned to brigades and divisions, as indicated in the sub joined statements.

In a staff charged with labors so various and important as that of the army of the Potomac, a chief was indispensable to supervise the various departments and to relieve the commanding general of details. The officer of chief of staff, well known in European armies, had not been considered necessary in our small peace establishment. The functions of the office were not defined, and, so far as exercised, had been included in the Adjutant General's department. The small number of officers in this department, and the necessity for their employ ment in other duties, have obliged commanding generals, during this war, to resort to other branches of the service to furnish suitable chiefs of staff. On the 4th of September, 1861, I appointed Colonel R. B. Marcy, of the inspector general's department, chief of staff, and he entered upon service im mediately, discharging the various and important duties with great fidelity, industry, and ability, from this period until I was removed from command at Rectortown. Many improvements have been made during the war in our system of staff administration, but much remains to be done. Our own experience, and that of other armies, agree in determining the neces sity for an efficient and able staff. To obtain this, our staff establishment should be based on correct principles, and extended to be adequate to the necessities of the service, and should include a system of staff and line education. The affairs of the Adjutant General's department, while I commanded the army of the Potomac, were conducted by Brigadier General S. Williams, as sisted by Lieutenant Colonel James A. Bardie, aide-de-camp. Their manage ment of the department during the organization of the army in the fall and winter of 1861, and during its subsequent operations in the field, was excellent. They were, during the entire period, assisted by Captain Richard B. Irwin, aide-de-camp, and during the organization of the army by the following-named officers : Captains Joseph Kirkland, Arthur McClellan, M. T. McMahon, Wil liam P. Mason, and William F. Biddle, aides-de-camp. My personal staff, when we embarked for the Peninsula, consisted of Colonel Thomas M. Key, additional aide-de-camp ; Colonel E. H. Wright, additional aide-de-camp and major, 6th United States cavalry ; Colonel T. T. Gautt, ad ditional aide-de-camp ; Colonel J. J. Astor, jr., volunteer aide-de-camp ; Lieu tenant Colonel A. V. Colburn, additional aide-de-camp and captain, Adjutant General's department ; Lieutenant Colonel N. B. Sweitzer, additional aide-de camp and captain, lst United States cavalry; Lieutenant Colonel Edward McK. Hudson, additional aide-de-camp and captain, 14th United States infantry ; Lieutenant Colonel Paul Von Radowitz, additional aide-de-camp ; Major H. Von Hammerstein, additional aide-de-camp ; Major W. W. Russell, United States marine corps ; Major F. LeCompte, of the Swiss army, volunteer aide de-camp ; Captains Joseph Kirkland, Arthur McClellan, L. P. D'Orleans, R. D'Orleans, M. T. McMahon, William P. Mason, jr., William F. Biddle, and E. A. Raymond, additional aides-de-camp. To this number I am tempted to add the Prince de Joinville, who constantly"], [32, "24 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. accompanied me through the trying campaign of the Peninsula, and frequently rendered important services. Of these officers Captain McMahon was assigned to the personal staff of Brigadier General Franklin, and Captains Kirkland and Mason to that of Brigadier General F. J. Porter during the siege of Yorktown. They remained subsequently with those general officers. Major LeCompte left the army during the siege of Yorktown ; Colonels Gantt and Astor, Major Russell, Captains L. P. D'Orleans, R. D'Orleans, and Raymond at the close of the Peninsula campaign. Before its termination Captains W. S. Abert and Charles R. Lowell, of the 6th United States cavalry, joined my staff as aides-de-camp, and remained with me until I was relieved from the command of the army of the Potomac. All of these officers served me with great gallantry and devotion ; they were ever ready to execute any service, no matter bow dangerous, difficult, or fatiguing. ENGINEERS Wheu I assumed command of the army of the Potomac I found Major J. G. Barnard, United States engineers, subsequently brigadier general of volunteers, occupying the position of chief engineer of that army. I continued him in the same office, and at once gave the necessary instructions for the completion of the de fences of the capital, and for the entire reorganization of the department. Under his direction the entire system of defences was carried into execution. This was completed before the army departed for Fort Monroe, and is a sufficient evidence of the skill of the engineers and the diligent labor of the troops. For some months after the organization of the army of the Potomac was com menced there were no engineer troops with it. At length, however, three com panies were assigned. Under the skilful management of Captain J. C. Duane, United States engineers, these new companies rapidly became efficient, and, as will be seen, rendered most valuable service during the ensuing campaigns. The number of engineer troops being entirely inadequate to the necessities of the army, an effort was made to partially remedy this defect by detailing the 15th and 50th New York volunteers, which contained many sailors and me chanics, as engineer troops. They were first placed under the immediate superintendence of Lieutenant Colonel B. S. Alexander, United States engineers, by whom they were instructed in the duties of pontoniers, and became somewhat familiar with those of sappers and miners. Previous to the movement of the army for the Peninsula this brigade was placed under the command of Brigadier General D. P. Woodbury, major United States engineers. The labor of preparing the engineer and bridge trains devolved chiefly upon Captain Duane, who was instructed to procure the new model French bridge train, as I was satisfied that the India-rubber pontoon was entirely useless for the general purposes of a campaign. The engineer department presented the following complete organization when the army moved for the Peninsula : Brigadier General J. G. Barnard, chief engineer ; First Lieutenant H. C. Abbott, topographical engineers, aide-de-camp. Brigade volunteer engineers, Brigadier General Woodbury commanding : 15th New York volunteers, Colonel McLeod Murphy ; 50th New York volunteers, Colonel C. B. Stewart. Battalion, three companies United States engineers, Captain J. C. Duane commanding ; companies respectively commanded by First Lieutenants C. B. Reese, C. E. Cross, and 0. E. Babcock, United States engineers. The chief engineer was ably assisted in his duties by Lieutenant Colonel B. S. Alexander, and First Lieutenants C. R. Comstock, M. D. McAlester, and Merrill, United States en gineers. Captain C. S. Stuart and Second Lieutenant F. U. Farquhar, United States engineers, joined after the army arrived at Fort Monroe. The necessary bridge equipage for the operations of a large army had been"], [33, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 25 collected, consisting of bateaux with the anchors and flooring material, (French model,) trestles, and engineers' tools, with the necessary wagons for their trans portation. The small number of officers of this corps available rendered it impracticable to detail engineers permanently at the headquarters of corps and divisions. The companies of regular engineers never had their proper number of officers, and it was necessary, as a rule, to follow the principle of detailing engineer officers temporarily whenever their services were required. TOPOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERS. To the corps of topographical engineers was intrusted the collection of topo graphical information and the preparation of campaign maps. Until a short time previous to the departure of the army for Fort Monroe, Lieutenant Colonel John W. Macomb was in charge of this department, and prepared a large amount of valuable material. He was succeeded by Brigadier General A. A. Humphreys, who retained the position throughout the Peninsula campaign. These officers were assisted by Lieutenants H. L. Abbott, O. G. Wagner, N. Bowen, John M. Wilson, and James H. Wilson, topographical engineers. This number, being the greatest available, was so small that much of the duty of the department devolved upon parties furnished by Professor Bache, Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and other gentlemen from civil life. Owing to the entire absence of reliable topographical maps, the labors of this corps were difficult and arduous in the extreme. Notwithstanding the energy and ability displayed by General Humphreys, Lieutenant Colonel Macomb, and their subordinates, who frequently obtained the necessary information under fire, the movements of the army were sometimes unavoidably delayed by the difficulty of obtaining knowledge of the country in advance. The result of their labors has been the preparation of an excellent series of maps, which will be invaluable to any army traversing the same ground. During the campaign it was impossible, to draw a distinct line of demarcation between the duties of the two corps of engineers so that the labors of reconnois sances of roads, of lines of intrenchments, of fields for battle, and of the position of the enemy, as well as the construction of siege and defensive works, were habitually performed by details from either corps, as the convenience of the service demanded. I desire to express my high appreciation of the skill, gallantry, and devotion displayed by the officers of both corps of engineers, under the most trying cir cumstances. During the Maryland campaign I united the two corps under Captain J. C. Duane, United States engineers, and found great advantages from the arrangement. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. For the operations of the medical department I refer to the reports, trans mitted herewith, of Surgeon Charles S. Tripler and Surgeon Jonathan Letterman, who, in turn, performed the duties of medical director of the army of the Potomac, the former from August 12, 1861, until July 1, 1862, and the latter after that date. The difficulties to be overcome in organizing and making effec tive the medical department were very great, arising principally from the inexperience of the regimental medical officers, many of whom were physicians taken suddenly from civil life, who, according to Surgeon Tripler, \" had to be instructed in their duties from the very alphabet,\" and from the ignorance of the line officers as to their relations with the medical officers, which gave rise to confusion and conflict of authority. Boards of examination were instituted, by which many ignorant officers were removed; and by the successive exertions of Surgeons Tripler and Letterman, the medical corps was brought to a very high"], [34, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 26 degree of efficiency. With regard to the sanitary condition of the army while on the Potomac, Dr. Tripler says that the records show a constantly increasing immunity from disease. \"In October and November, 1861, with an army averaging 130,000 men, we had 7,932 cases of fever of all sorts ; of these, about 1,000 were reported as cases of typhoid fever. I know that errors of diagnosis were frequently committed, and therefore this must be considered as the limit of typhoid cases. If any army in the world can show such a record as this, I do not know when or where it was assembled.\" From September, 1861, to February, 1862, while the army was increasing, the number of sick decreased from 7 per cent, to 6.18 per cent. Of these, the men sick in tho regimental and general hospitals were less than one-half ; the remainder were slight cases, under treatment in quarters. \" During this time, so far as rumor was concerned, the army was being decimated by disease every month.\" Of the sanitary condition of the army during the Peninsula campaign, up to its arrival at Harrison's landing, Dr. Tripler says : \" During this campaign the army was favored with excellent health. No epidemic disease appeared. Those scourges of modern armies \u2014 dysentery, tupus, cholera \u2014 were almost unknown. We had some typhoid fever and more malarial fevers, but even these never prevailed to such an extent as to create any alarm. The sick reports were sometimes larger than we cared to have them ; but the great majority of the cases reported were such as did not threaten life or permanent disability. I regret that I have not before me the retained copies of the monthly reports, so that I might give accurate statistics. I have endeavored to recover them, but have been unsuccessful. My recollection is, that the whole sick report never exceeded 8 per cent, of the force, and this including all sorts of cases, the trivial as well as the severe. The army of the Potomac must be conceded to have been the most healthy army in the service of the United States.\" His remarks at the conclusion of his report upon our system of medical administration, and his suggestions for its improvement, are especially worthy of attention. The service, labors, and privations of the troops during the seven days' battles had, of course, a great effect on the health of the army after it reached Harrison's landing, incieasing the number of sick to about 20 per cent, of the whole force. The nature of the military operations had also unavoidably placed the medical department in a very unsatisfactory condition. Supplies bad been almost entirely exhausted or necessarily abandoned ; hospital tents abandoned or de stroyed, and the medical officers deficient in numbers and broken down by fatigue. All the remarkable energy and ability of Surgeon Letterman were required to restore the efficiency of his department ; but before we left Harrison's land ing he had succeeded in fitting it out thoroughly with the supplies it required, and the health of the army was vastly improved by the sanitary measures which were euforced at his suggestion. The great haste with which the army was removed from the Peninsula made it necessary to leave at Fort Monroe, to be forwarded afterwards, nearly all the baggage and transportation, including medical stores and ambulances, all the vessels being required to transport the troops themselves and their ammunition ; and when the army of the Potomac returned to Washington after General Pope's campaign, and the medical department came once more under Surgeon Letterman's control, he found it in a deplorable condition. The officers were worn out by the labors they had performed, and the few supplies that had been brought from the Peninsula had been exhausted or abandoned, so that the work of n organization and resupplying had to be again performed, and this while the army was moving rapidly, and almost in the face of the enemy. That it was successfully accomplished is shown by the care and attention which the wounded received after the battles of South Mountain and Antietam."], [35, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 27 Among the improvements introduced into his department by Surgeon Letter man, the principal are the organization of an ambulance corps, the system of field hospitals, and the method of supplying by brigades, all of which were in stituted during the Maryland campaign, and have since proved very efficient. QUARTERMASTER'S DEPARTMENT. On assuming command of the troops in and around Washington, I appointed Captain S. Van Vliet, assistant quartermaster, (afterwards brigadier general,) chief quartermaster to my command, and gave him the necessary instructions for organizing his department, and collectiug the supplies requisite for the large army then called for. The disaster at Manassas had but recently occurred, and the army was quite destitute of quartermaster's stores. General Van Vliet, with great energy and zeal, set himself about the task of furnishing the supplies immediately neces sary, and preparing to obtain the still larger amounts which would be required by the new troops, which were moving in large numbers towards the capital. The principal depot for supi lies in the city of Washington was under charge of Colonel D. H. Ruckei, assistant quartermaster, who ably performed his duties. Lieutenant Colonel 1!. Ingalls, assistant quartermaster, was placed in charge of the department on the south side of the Potomac. 1 directed a large depot for transportation to be established at Perry ville, on the left bank of the Susque hanna, a point equally accessible by rail and water. Captain C. G. Sawtelle, assistant quartermaster, was detailed to organize the camp, and performed his duties to my entire satisfaction. Captain J. J. Dana, assistant quartermaster, had immediate charge of the transportation in and about Washington, as well as of the large number of horses purchased for the use of the artillery and cavalry. The principal difficulties which General Van Vliet had to encounter arose from the inexperience of the majority of the officers of his department in the new regiments and brigades. The necessity of attending personally to minor details rendered his duties arduous and harassing in the extreme. All obstacles, however, were surmounted by the untiring industry of the chief quartermaster and his immediate subordi nates, and when the army was prepared to move the organization of the depart ment was found to be admirable. When it was determined to move the army to the Peninsula, the duties of providing water transportation were devolved by the Secretary of War upon his assistant, the Hon. John Tucker. The vessels were ordered to Alexandria, and Lieutenant Colonel Ingalls was placed in immediate charge of the embarka tion of the troops, transportation, and material of every description. Opera tions of this nature, on so extensive a scale, had no parallel in the history of our country. The arrangements of Lieutenant Colonel Ingalls were perfected with remarka ble skill and energy, and the army and its materiel were embarked and trans ported to Fortress Aloiiroe in a very short space of time, aud entirely without loss. During the operations on the Peninsula, until the arrival of troops at Harri son's landing, General Van Vliet retained the position of chief quartermaster, and maintained the thorough organization and efficiency of his department. The principal depots of supplies were under the immediate charge of Lieutenant Colonels Ingalls and Sawtelle. On the 10th of July, 1862, General Van Vliet having requested to be relieved from duty with the army of the Potomac, I appointed Lieutenant Colonel In galls chief quartermaster, and he continued to discharge the duties of that office during the remainder of the Peninsula and the Maryland campaigns in a man ner which fully sustained the high reputation he had previously acquired."], [36, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 28 The immediate amount of labor accomplished, often under the most difficult circumstances, the admirable system under which the duties of the department were performed, and the entire success which attended the efforts to supply so large an army, reflect the highest credit upon the officers upon whom these oner ous duties devolved. The reports of General Van Vliet and Lieutenant. Colonel Ingalls, with the accompanying documents, give in detail the history of the de partment from its organization until I was relieved from the command of the army of the Potomac. SUBSISTENCE DEPARTMENT. On the lst of August, 1861, Colonel H. F. Clark, commissary of subsistence, joined my staff, and at once entered upon his duties as chief commissary of the army of the Potomac. In order to realize the responsibilities pertaining to this office, as well as to form a proper estimate of the vast amount of labor which must necessarily devolve upon its occupant, it is only necessary to consider the unprepared state of the country to engage in a war of such magnitude as the present, and the lack of practical knowledge, on the part of the officers, with reference to supplying and subsisting a large, and, at that time, unorganized army. Yet, notwithstanding the existence of these great obstacles, the manner in which the duties of the commissary department were discharged was such as to merit and call forth the commendation of the entire army. During the stay of the army of the Potomac in the vicinity of Washington, prior to the Peninsula campaign, its subsistence was drawn chiefly from the depots which had been established by the commissary department at Washing ton, Alexandria, Forts Corcoran and Runyon. In the important task of desig nating and establishing depots of supplies, Colonel Clarke was ably seconded by his assistants, Colonel Amos Beckwith, commissary of subsistence, U. S. A.; Lieutenant Colonel George Bell, commissary of subsistence, U. S. A. ; Lieuten ant Colonel A. P. Porter, commissary of subsistence, U. S. A.; Captain Thomas Wilson, commissary of subsistence, U. S. A. ; Captain Brownell Granger, com missary of subsistence, U. S. volunteers ; Captain W. H. Bell, commissary of subsistence, U. S. A. ; Captain J. H. Woodward, commissary of subsistence, U. S. volunteers ; and Captain W. R. Murphy, commissary of subsistence, U. S. volunteers. For a full knowledge of the highly creditable manner in which each and all of the above-mentioned officers discharged their duties, I invite attention to the detailed report of Colonel Clarke. The remarks and suggestions contained in his report are worthy of attention, as affording valuable rules for the future guidance of the subsistence department in supplying armies in the field. The success of the subsistence department of the army of the Potomac was in a great measure attributable to the fact that the subsistence department at Washington made ample provision for sending supplies to the Peninsula, and that it always exercised the most intelligent foresight. It moreover gave its advice and countenance to the officers charged with its duties and reputation in the field, and those officers, I am happy to say, worked with it, and together, in perfect harmony for the public good. During the entire period that I was in command of the army of the Potomac there was no instance within my knowledge where the troops were without their rations from any fault of the officers of this department. ORDNANCE DEPARTMENT. This very important branch of the service was placed under the charge of Captain C. P. Kingsbury, ordnance corps, colonel and aide-de-camp. Great difficulty existed in the proper organization of the department for the want of a sufficient number of suitable officers to perform the duties at the various head-"], [37, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 29 quarters and depots of supply. But far greater obstacles had to be surmounted, from the fact that the supply of small arms was totally inadequate to the demands of a large army, and a vast proportion of those furnished were of such inferior quality as to be unsatisfactory to the troops, and condemned by their officers. The supply of artillery was more abundant, but of great variety. Rifled ordnance was just coming into use, for the first time in this country, and the description of gun and kind of projectile which would prove most effective, and should, therefore, be adopted, was a mere matter of theory. To obviate these difficulties, large quantities of small arms of foreign manufacture were contracted for ; private enterprise in the construction of arms and ammunition was encouraged ; and by the time the army was ordered to move to the Penin sula the amount of ordnance and ordnance stores was ample. Much also had been done to bring the quality, both of arms and ammunition, up to the proper standard. Boards of officers were in session continually during the autumn and winter of 1861, to test the relative merits of new arms and projectiles. The reports of these boards, confirmed by subsequent experience in the field, have done much to establish the respective claims of different inventors aud manufacturers. During the campaigns of the Peninsula and Maryland the officers connected with the department were zealous and energetic, and kept the troops well supplied, notwithstanding the perplexing and arduous nature of their duties. One great source of perplexity was the fact that it had been necessary to issue arms of all varieties and calibres, giving an equal diversity in the kinds of ammunition required. Untiring watchfulness was therefore incumbent upou the officers in charge to prevent confusion and improper distribution of cartridges. Colonel Kingsbury discharged the. duties of his office with great efficiency until the day of July, 1862, when his health required that he should be relieved. First Lieutenant Thomas G. Baylor, ordnance corps, suc ceeded him, aud performed his duty during the remainder of the Peninsula aud Maryland campaigns with marked ability and success. The want of reports from Colonel Kingsbury and Lieutenant Baylor renders it impossible for me to enter at all into the details of the organization of the department. PROVOST MARSHAL'S DEPARTMENT. Immediately after I was placed in command of the \" Division of the Poto mac,\" I appointed Colonel Andrew Porter, 16th regiment infantry, provost marshal of Washington. All the available regular infantry, a battery, and a squadron of cavalry, were placed under his command, and by his energetic action he soon corrected the serious evils which existed, and restored order in the city. When the army was about to take the field, General Porter was appointed Provost Marshal General of the army of the Potomac, and held that most im portant position until the end of the Peninsula campaign, when sickness, con tracted iu the untiring discharge of his duties, compelled him to ask to be relieved from the position he had so ably and energetically filled. The Provost Marshal General's department had the charge of a class of duties which had not before, in our service, been defined and grouped under the man agement of a special department. The following subjects indicate the sphere of this department : Suppression of marauding and depredations, and of all brawls and disturb ances, preservation of good order, and suppression of disturbances beyond the limits of the camps. Prevention of straggling on the inarch. Suppression of gambling houses, drinking houses, or bar-rooms, and brothels. Regulation of hotels, taverns, markets, and places of public amusement. Searches, seizures and arrests. Execution of sentences of general courts .martial, involving imprisonment or capital punishment. Enforcement, of orders"], [38, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 30 prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors, whether by tradesmen or sutlers, and of orders respecting passes. Deserters from the enemy. Prisoners of war taken from the enemy. Countersigning safeguards. Passes to citizens within the lines, and for purposes of trade. Complaints of citizens as to the conduct of the soldiers. General Porter was assisted by the following named officers : Major W. H. Wood, 17th United States infantry; Captain James McMillom, acting assistant adjutant general. 17th United States infantry ; Captain W. T. Gentry, 17th United States infantry; Captain J. W. Forsurth, 18th United States infantry; Lieutenant J.W.Jones, 12th United States infantry ; Lieu tenant C. F. Trowbridge, 16th United States infantry; and Lieutenant G. D. Mehaffey, lst United States infantry. The provost guard was composed of the 2d United States cavalry, Major Pleasanton, and a battalion of the 8th and 17th United States infantry, Major Willard. After General Porter was relieved, Major Wood was in charge of this department until after the battle of Antietam, when Brigadier General Patrick was appointed Provost Marshal General. COMMANDANT OF GENERAL HEADQUARTERS. Wheu the army took the field, for the purpose of securing order and regularity in the camp of headquarters, and facilitating its movements, the office of com mandant of general headquarters was created, and assigned to Major G. O. Haller, 7th United States infantry. Six companies of infantry were placed under his orders for guard and police duty. Among the orders appended to this report is the one defining his duties, which were always satisfactorily per formed. JUDGE ADVOCATE. From August, 1861, the position of judge advocate was held by Colonel Thomas T. Gantt, aide-de-camp, until compelled by ill health to retire, at Harri son's landing, in August, 1862. His reviews of the decisions of courts-martial during this period were of great utility in correcting the practice in military courts, diffusing true notions of discipline and subordination, and setting before the army a high standard of soldierly honor. Upon the retirement of Colonel Gantt the duties of judge advocate were ably performed by Colonel Thomas M. Key, aide-de-camp. SIGNAL CORPS. The method of conveying intelligence and orders, invented and introduced into the service by Major Albert J. Myer, signal officer United States army, was first practically tested in large operations during the organization of the army of the Potomac. Under the direction of Major Myer a signal corps was formed by detailing officers and men from the different regiments of volunteers and instructing them in the use of the flags by day and torches by night. The chief signal officer was indefatigable in his exertions to render his corns effective, and it soon became available for service in every division of the army. In addition to the flags and torches, Major Myer introduced a portable insulated telegraph wire, which could be readily laid from point to point, and which could be used under the same general system. In front of Washington, and on the Lower Potomac, at any point within our lines not reached by the military tel egraph, the great usefulness of this system of signals was made manifest. But"], [39, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 31 it was not until after the arrival of the army upon the Peninsula, and during the siege and battles of that and the Maryland campaigns, that the great benefits to be derived from it on the field and under fire were fully appreciated. There was scarcely any action or skirmish in which the signal corps did not render important services. Often under heavy fire of artillery, and not unfre quently while exposed to musketry, the officers and men of this corps gave in formation of the movements of the enemy, and transmitted directions for the evolutions of our own troops. The report of the chief signal officer, with accompanying documents, will give the details of the services of this corps, aud call attention to those members of it who were particularly distinguished. TELEGRAPHIC. The telegraphic operations of the army of the Potomac were superintended by Major Thomas J. Eckert, and under the immediate direction of Mr. Caldwell, who was, with a corps of operators, attached to my headquarters during the entire campaigns upon the Peninsula and in Maryland. The services of this corps were arduous and efficient. Under the admirable arrangements of Major Eckert they were constantly provided with all the material for constructing new lines, which were rapidly established whenever the army changed position; and it was not unfrequently the case that the operatives worked under fire from the enemy's guns; yet they invariably per formed all the duties required of them with great alacrity and cheerfulness, and it was seldom that I was without the means of direct telegraphic communication with the War Department and with the corps commanders. From the organization of the army of the Potomac up to November 1, 1862, including the Peninsula and Maryland campaigns, upwards of twelve hundred (1,200) miles of military telegraph line had been constructed in connexion with the operations of the army, and the number of operatives aud builders em ployed was about two hundred, (200.) To Professor Lowe, the intelligent and enterprising aeronaut, who had the management of the balloons, I was greatly indebted for the valuable informa tion obtained during his ascensions. I have more than once taken occasion to recommend the members of my staff, both general and personal, for promotion and reward. I beg leave to repeat these recommendations, and to record their names in the history of the army of the Potomac, as gallant soldiers, to whom their country owes a debt of gratitude still unpaid, for the courage, ability, and untiring zeal they displayed during the eventful campaigns in which they bore so prominent a part. CHAPTER II. On the 15th of October the main body of the army of the Potomac was in the immediate vicinity of Washington, with detachments on the left bank of the Potomac as far down as Liverpool point, and as far up as Williamsport and its vicinity. The different divisions were posted as follows : Hooker at Budd's ferry, Lower Potomac ; Heintzelman at Fort Lyon and vicinity ; Franklin near the theological seminary ; Blenker near Hunter's chapel ; McDowell at Upton's hill and Arlington ; F. J. Porter at Hall's and Miner's hills; Smith at Mack all's hill; McCall at Langley; Buell at Tenallytown, Meridian hill, Emory's chapel, &c, on the left bank of the river ; Casey at Washington ; Stoneman's cavalry at Washington; Hunt's artillery at Washington; Banks at Dames town, with detachments at Point of Rocks, Sandy Hook, Williamsport, &c; Stone at Poolsville; and Dix at Baltimore, with detachments on the Eastern Shore."], [40, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 32 On the 19th of October, 1861, General McCall marched to Drainsville with his division, in order to cover reconnoissances to be made in all directions the next day, for the purpose of learning the position of the enemy, and of cover ing the operations of the topographical engineers in making maps of that region. On the 29th, acting in concert with General McCall, General Smith pushed strong parties to Freedom hill, Vienna, Flint hill, Peacock hill, &c, to accom plish the same purpose in that part of the front. These reconnoissances were successful. On the morning of the 20th I received the following telegram from General Banks's headquarters : \" Darnestown, October 20, 1861. \" Sir : The signal station at Sugar Loaf telegraphs that the enemy have moved away from Leesburg. All quiet here. \"R. M. COPELAND, \"Assistant Adjutant General. \" General Marcy.\" Whereupon I sent to General Stone, at Poolsville, the following telegram 'Camp Griffin, October 20, 1861. \"General McClellan desires me to inform you that General McCall occupied Drainsville yesterday, and is still there. Will send out heavy reconnoissances to-day in all directions from that poiut. The general desires that you will keep a good look-out upon Leesburg, to see if this movement has the effect to drive them away. Perhaps a slight demonstration on your part would have the effect to move them. \"A. V. COLBURN, \"Assistant Adjutant General. \"Brigadier General C. P. Stone, Poolsville.\" Deeming it possible that General McCall's movement to Drainsville, together with the subsequent reconnoissances, might have the effect of inducing the enemy to abandon Leesburg, and the despatch from Sugar Loaf appearing to confirm this view, I wished General Stone, who had only a line of pickets on the river, the mass of his troops being out of sight of, and beyond range from, the Virginia bank, to make some display of an intention to cross, and also to watch the enemy more closely than usual. I did not direct him to cross, nor did I intend that he should cross the river in force for the purpose of fighting. The above despatch was sent on the 20th, and reached General Stone as early as 11 a. m. of that day. I expected him to accomplish all that was intended on the same day ; and this he did, as will be seen from the following despatch, received at my headquarters in Washington from Poolsville on the evening of October 20 : \" Made a feint of crossing at this place this afternoon, and at the same time started a reconnoitring party towards Leesburg from Harrison's island. The enemy's pickets retired to intrenchments. Report of reconnoitring party not yet received. I have means of crossing one hundred and twenty-five men once in ten minutes at each of two points. River falling slowly. \"C. P. STONE, \"Brigadier General. \"Major General McClellan.\" As it was not foreseen or expected that General McCall would be needed to co-operate with General Stone in any attack, he was directed to fall back from"], [41, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 33 Drainsville to his original camp, near Prospect hill, as soon as the required re connoissances were completed. Accordingly he left Drainsville, on his return, at about 8J a. m. of the 21st, reaching his old camp at about 1 p. m. In the mean time I was surprised to hear from General Stone that a portion of his troops were engaged on the Virginia side of the river, and at once sent in structions to General McCall to remain at Drainsville, if he had not left before the order reached him. The order did not reach him until his return to his camp at Langley. He was then ordered to rest his men, and hold his division in readiness to return to Drainsville at a moment's notice, should it become necessary. Similar instruc tions were given to other divisions during the afternoon. The first intimation I received from Generel Stone of the real nature of his movements was in a telegram, as follows: \"Edwards's Ferry, October 21 \u2014 11.10 a. m. \" The enemy have been engaged opposite Harrison's island ; our men are be having admirably. \"C. P. STONE, \" Brigadier General. \"Major General McClellan.\" At 2 p. m. General Banks's adjutant general sent the following: \"Darnestown, October 21, 1861 \u2014 2 p. m. \"General Stone safely crossed the river this morning. Some engagements have taken place on the other side of the river \u2014 how important is not known. \" R. M. COPELAND, \"Acting Assistant Adjutant General. \" General R. B. Mabcy.\" General Stone sent the following despatches on the same day at the hours indicated : \"Edwards's Ferry, October 21, 1861 \u2014 2 p. m. \"There has been sharp firing on the right of our line, and our troops appear to be advancing there under Baker. The left, under Gorman, has advanced its skirmishers nearly one mile, and, if the movement continues successful, will turn the enemy's right. \" 0. P.

M'CLELLAN. \" All was reported going well up to Baker's death, but, in the confusion fol lowing that, the right wing was outflanked. Ina few hours I shall, unless a night attack is made, be in the same position as last night, save the loss of many good men. \"C. P. STONE, Brigadier General. \" Major General McClellan.\" Although no more fully informed of the state of affairs, I had, during the afternoon, as a precautionary measure, ordered General Banks to send one brigade to the support of the troops at Harrison's island, and to move with the other two to Seneca mills, ready to support General Stone if necessary. The 9.30 p. m. despatch of General Stone did not give me an entire understanding of the state of the case. Aware of the difficulties and perhaps fatal consequences of recrossing such a river as the Potomac after a repulse, and from these telegrams supposing his whole force to be on the Virginia side, I directed General Stone to intrench himself, and hold the Virginia side at all hazards until re-enforcements could arrive, when he could safely withdraw to the Maryland side, or hold his po sition on the Virginia side, should that prove advisable. General Banks was instructed to move the rest of his division to Edwards's ferry, and to send over as many men as possible before daylight to re-enforce Stone. He did not arrive in time to effect this, and was instructed to collect all the canal-boats he could find, and use them for crossing at Edwards's ferry in sufficient force to enable the troops already there to hold the opposite side. On the 22d I went to the ground in person, and reaching Poolsville, learned for the first time the full details of the affair. The following extract from the evidence of General Stone before the \"Com mittee on the Conduct of the War\" on the 5th of January, 1862, will throw further light on this occurrence. General Stone says he received the order from my headquarters to make a slight demonstration at about 11 o'clock a.m. on the 20 th, and that, in obedience to that order, he made the demonstration on the evening of the same day. In regard to the reconnoissance on the 21st, which resulted in the battle of Ball's Bluff, he was asked the following questions : Question. \"Did this reconnoissance originate with yourself, or had you orders from the general-in-chief to make it V To which he replied, \" It originated with myself \u2014 the reconnoissance.\" Question. \" The order did not proceed from General McClellan ?\" Answer. \"I was directed the day before to make a demonstration; that demonstration was made the day previous.\" Question. \" Did you receive an order from the general-in-chief to make the reconnoissance V Answer. \" No, sir.\" Making a personal examination on the 23d, I found that the position on the Virginia side at Edwards's ferry was not a tenable one, but did not think it wise to withdraw the troops by daylight. I therefore caused more artillery to be placed in position on the Maryland side to cover the approaches to the ground held by us, and crossed the few additional troops that the high wind permitted us to get over, so as to be as secure as possible against any attack during the day. Before nightfall all the precautions were taken to secure an orderly and quiet passage of the troops and guns. The movement was commenced soon after dark, under the personal super vision of General Stone, who received the order for the withdrawal at 7.15 p. m. By 4 a. m. of the 24th everything had reached the Maryland shore in safety. A few davs afterwards I received information which seemed to be authentic, to"], [43, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 35 the effect that large bodies of the enemy had been ordered from Manassas to Leesburg, to cut off our troops on the Virginia side. Their timely withdrawal had probably prevented a still more serious disaster. I refer to General Stone's report of this battle, furnished the War Depart ment, and his published testimony before the \" Committee on the Conduct of the War,\" for further details. The records of the War Department show my anxiety and efforts to assume active offensive operations in the fall and early winter. It is only just to say, however, that the unprecedented condition of the roads and Virginia soil would have delayed an advance till February, had the discipline, organization, and equipment of the army been as complete at the close of the fall as was necessary, and as I desired and labored against every impediment to make them. While still in command only of the army of the Potomac, namely, in early September, I proposed the formation of a corps of New Englanders for coast service in the bays and inlets of the Chesapeake and Potomac, to co-operate with my own command, from which most of its material was drawn. On the first of November, however, I was called to relieve Lieutenant General Scott in the chief and general command of the armies of the Union. The di rection and nature of this coast expedition, therefore, were somewhat changed, as will soon appear in the original plan submitted to the Secretary of War, and the letter of instructions later issued to General Burnside, its commander. The whole country indeed had now become the theatre of military operations from the Potomac to beyond the Mississippi, and to assist the navy in perfect ing and sustaining the blockade, it became necessary to extend these operations to points on the sea-coast, Roanoke island, Savannah, and New Orleans. It remained also to equip and organize the armies of the west, whose condition was little better than that of the army of the Potomac had been. The direction of the campaigns in the west, and of the operations upon the seaboard, enabled me to enter upon larger combinations and to accomplish results, the necessity and advantage of which had not been unforeseen, but which had been beyond the ability of the single army formerly under my command to effect. The following letters, and a subsequent, paper addressed to the Secretary of War, sufficiently indicate the nature of those combinations to minds accus tomed to reason upon mditary operations : \" Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Washington, September 6, 1861. \"Sir : I have the honor to suggest the following proposition, with the request that the necessary authority be at once given me to carry it out: to organize a force of two brigades of five regiments each, of New England men, for the general service, but particularly adapted to coast service \u2014 the officers and men to be sufficiently conversant with boat service, to manage steamers, saUing ves- sels, launches, barges, surf-boats, floating batteries, &c. To charter or buy for the command a sufficient number of propellers, or tug-boats, for transportation of men and supplies, the machinery of which should be amply protected by timber ; the vessels to have permanent experienced officers from the merchant service, but to be manned by details from the command. A naval officer to be attached to the staff of the commanding officer. The flank companies of each regiment to be armed with Dahlgren boat guns, and carbines with water-proof cartridges ; the other companies to have such arms as I may hereafter designate; to be uniformed and equipped as the Rhode Island regiments are. Launches and floating batteries with timber parapets of sufficient capacity to land or bring into action the entire force. \" The entire management and organization of the force to be under my control, and to form an integral part of the army of the Potomac. \" The immediate object of this force is for operations in the inlets of Chesa-"], [44, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE, B. M'CLELLAN. 36 peakebayand the Potomac; by enabling me thus to land troop at pointe where they are needed, this force can also be used m conjunction with a naval W operating against points on the sea-coast. This coast division to be com mandedPby a general officer of my selection; the regiments to be organised as oZ land forces; the disbursements for vessels &c, to be made by the proper department of the army upon the requisitions of the general commanding the division, with my approval. \"I think the entire force can be organized in thirty days, and by no means the least of the advantages of this proposition is the fact that it will call into the service a class of men who would not otherwise enter the army \"You will immediately perceive that the object of this force is to follow along the coast and up the inlets and rivers, the movements of the mam army when it advances. \"I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, \"Major General, Commanding. \" Hon. Simon Cameron, * Secretary of War.\" Owing chiefly to the difficulty in procuring the requisite vessels, and adapting them to the special purposes contemplated, this expedition was not ready for service until January, 1862. Then in the chief command, I deemed it best to send it to North Carolina, with the design indicated in the following letter. \"Headquarters of the Army, \" Washington, January 7, 1862. \" General : In accordance with verbal instructions heretofore given yo you will, after uniting with Flag-officer Goldsborough at Fort Monroe, proceed un der his convoy to Hatteras inlet, where you will, in connexion with him, take the most prompt measures for crossing the fleet over the Bulkhead into the waters of the sound. Under the accompanying general order constituting the department of North Carolina, you will assume command of the garrison at Hatteras inlet, and make such dispositions in regard to that place as your ulterior operations may render necessary, always being careful to provide for the safety of that very important station in any contingency. \"Your first point of attack will be Roanoke island and its dependencies. It is presumed that the navy can reduce the batteries on the marshes, and cover the landing of your troops on the main island, by which, in connexion with a rapid movement of the gunboats to the northern extremity, as soon as the marsh battery is reduced, it may be hoped to capture the entire garrison of the place. Having occupied the island and its dependencies, you will at once pro ceed to the erection of the batteries and defences necessary to hold the position with a small force. Should the flag-officer require any assistance in seizing or holding the debouches of the canal from Norfolk, you will please afford it to him. \" The commodore and yourself having completed your arrangements in regard to Roanoke island, and the waters north of it, you will please at once, make a descent on Newbern, having gained possession of which and the railroad passing through it, you will at once throw a sufficient force upon Beaufort, and take the steps necessary to reduce Fort Macon and open that port. When you seize Newbern, you will endeavor to seize the railroad as far west as Golds borough, should circumstances favor such a movement. The temper of the people, the rebel force at hand, &c, will go far towards determining the ques tion as to how far west the railroad can be safely occupied and held. Should circumstances render it advisable to seize and hold Raleigh, the main north and south line of railroad passing through Goldsborough should be so effectually destroyed for considerable distances north and south of that point, as"], [45, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 37 to render it impossible for the rebels to use it to your disadvantage. A great point would be gained, in any event, by the effectual destruction of the WU mington and Weld on railroad. \"I would advise great caution in moving so far into the interior as upon Raleigh. Having accomplished the objects mentioned, the next point of interest would probably be Wilmington, the reduction of which may require that ad ditional means shall be afforded you. I would urge great caution in regard to proclamations. In no case would I go beyond a moderate joint proclamation with the naval commander, which should say as little as possible about politics or the negro ; merely state that the true issue for which we are fighting is the preservation of the Union, and upholding the laws of the general government, and stating that all who conduct themselves properly will, as far as possible, be protected in their persons and property. \" You will please report your operations as often as an opportunity offers itself. \" With my best wishes for your success, I am, &c, &c., \"GEO. B. McCLELLAN, \"Major General, Commanding in Chief \"Brigadier General A. E. Burnside, \"Commanding Expedition.\" The following letters of instruction were sent to Generals Halleck, Buell Sherman, and Butler; and I also communicated verbally to these officers my views in full regarding the field of operations assigned to each, and gave them their instructions as much in detail as was necessary at that time: \" Headquarters of the Army, \" Washington, D C, November 11, 1861. \" General : In assigning you to the command of the department of Missouri, it is probably unnecessary for me to state that I have intrusted to you a duty which requires the utmost tact and decision. \" You have not merely the ordinary duties of a military commander to per form ; but the far more difficult task of reducing chaos to order, of changing probably the majority of the personnel of the staff of the department, and of re ducing to a point of economy, consistent with the interests and necessities of the State, a system of reckless expenditure and fraud, perhaps unheard of before in the history of the world. \" You will find in your department many general and staff officers holding illegal commissions and appointments, not recognized or approved by the Pres ident or Secretary of War. You will please at once inform these gentlemen of the nullity of their appointment, and see that no pay or allowances are issued to them until such time as commissions may be authorized by the President or Secretary of War. \" If any of them give the slightest trouble, you will at once arrest them and send them, under guard, out of the limits of your department, informing them that if they return they will be placed in close confinement.

I merely wish to ex press plainly the general ideas which occur to me in relation to the conduct of operations there. That portion of Kentucky west of the Cumberland river is by its position so closely related to the States of Illinois and Missouri, that it has seemed best to attach it to the department of Missouri. Your operations there, in Kentucky, will be confined to that portion of the State east of the Cumberland river. I trust I need not repeat to you that I regard the import ance of the territory committed to your care as second only to that occupied by the army under my immediate command. It is absolutely necessary that we shall hold all the State of Kentucky; not only that, but that the majority of its inhabitants shall be warmly in favor of our cause, it being that which best subserves their interests. It is possible that the conduct of our political affairs in Kentucky is more important than that of our military operations. I certainly cannot overestimate the importance of the former. You will please constantly to bear in mind the precise issue for which we are fighting ; that issue is the preservation of the Union and the restoration of the full authority of the general government over all portions of our territory. We shall most readily suppress this rebellion and restore the authority of the government by religiously respecting the constitutional rights of all. I know that I express"], [47, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 39 the feelings and opinion of the President when I say that we are fighting only to preserve the integrity of the Union and the constitutional authority of the general government. \" The inhabitants of Kentucky may rely upon it that their domestic institu tions will in no manner be interfered with, and that they will receive at our hands every constitutional protection. I have only to repeat that you will in all respects carefully regard the local institutions of the region in which you command, allowing nothing but the dictates of mditary necessity to cause you to depart from the spirit of these instructions. \" So much in regard to political considerations. The military problem would be a simple one could it be entirely separated from political influences ; such is not the case. Were the population among which you are to operate wholly or generally hostile, it is propable that Nashville should be your first and principal objective point. It so happens that a large majority of the inhabitants of eastern Tennessee are iu favor of the Union ; it therefore seems proper that you should remain on the defensive on the line from Louisville to Nashville, while you throw the mass of your forces, by rapid marches, by Cumberland gap \u00aer Walker's gap, on Knoxville, in order to occupy the railroad at that point, and thus enable the loyal citizens of eastern Tennessee to rise, while you at the same time cut off the railway communication between eastern Vir ginia and the Mississippi. It will be prudent to fortify the pass before leaving it in your rear. \" Brigadier General D. C. Buell.\" \" Headquarters of the Army, \" Washington, November 12, 1861. \"General : Upon assuming command of the department, I will be glad to have you make as soon as possible a careful report of the condition and situa- tion of your troops, and of the military and political condition of your com- mand. The main point to which I desire to call your attention is the neces- sity of entering eastern Tennessee as soon as it can be done with reasonable chances of success, and I hope that you will, with the least possible delay, or- ganize a column for that purpose, sufficiently guarding at the same time the main avenues by which the rebels may invade Kentucky. Our conversations on the subject of military operations have been so full, and my confidence in your judgment is so great, that I will not dwell further upon the subject, except to urge upon you the necessity of keeping me fully informed as to the state of affairs, both military and political, and your movements. In regard to political matters, bear in mind that we are fighting only to preserve the integrity of the Union and to uphold the power of the general government ; as far as military necessity will permit, religiously respect the constitutional rights of all. Pre serve the strictest discipline among the troops, and while employing the utmost energy in military movements, be careful so to treat the unarmed inhabitants as to contract, not widen, the breach existing between us and the rebels. \" I mean by this that it is the desire of the government to avoid unnecessary irritation by causeless arrests and persecution of individuals. Where there is good reason to believe that persons are actually giving aid, comfort, or infor mation to the enemy, it is of course necessary to arrest them ; but I have always found that it is the tendency of subordinates to make vexatious arrests on mere suspicion. You will find it well to direct that no arrest shall be made except by your order or that of your generals, unless in extraordinary cases, always holding the party making the arrest responsible for the propriety of his course. It should be our constant aim to make it apparent to all that their"], [48, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 40 property, their comfort, and their personal safety will be best preserved by ad hering to the cause of the Union. \" If the military suggestions I have made in this letter prove to have been founded on erroneous data, you are of course perfectly free to change the plans of operations. \" Brigadier General D. C. Buell, \" Commanding Department of the Ohio. \" Headquarters of the Army, \" Washington, February 14, 1862. \" General : Your despatches in regard to the occupation of Dafuskie island, &c, were received to-day. I saw also to-day, for the first time, your requisition for a siege train for Savannah. \"After giving the subject all the consideration in my power, I am forced to the conclusion that, under present circumstances, the siege and capture of Savan nah do not promise results commensurate with the sacrifices necessary. When I learned that it was possible for the gunboats to reach the Savannah river, above Fort Pulaski, two operations suggested themselves to my mind as its im mediate results. \" First. The capture of Savannah by a ' coup de main,' \u2014 the result of an in stantaneous advance and attack by the army and navy. \" The time for this has passed, and your letter indicates that you are not ac countable for the failure to seize the propitious moment, but that, on the con trary, you perceived its advantages. \" Second. To isolate Fort Pulaski, cut off its supplies, and at least facilitate its reduction by a bombardment. \" Although we have a long delay to deplore, the second course still remains open to us ; and I strongly advise the close blockade of Pulaski and its bom bardment as soon as the 13-inch mortars and heavy guns reach you. I am con fident you can thus reduce it. With Pulaski, you gain all that is really essen tial ; you obtain complete control of the harbor ; you relieve the blockading fleet, and render the main body of your force disposable for other operations. \" I do not consider the possession of Savannah worth a siege after Pulaski is in our hands. But the possession of Pulaski is of the first importance. The expedition to Fernandina is well, and I shall be glad to learn that it is ours. \" But, after all, the greatest moral effect would be produced by the reduction of Charleston and its defences. There the rebellion had its birth ; there the unnatural hatred of our government is most intense ; there is the centre of the boasted power and courage of the rebels. \" To gain Fort Sumter and hold Charleston is a task well worthy of our greatest efforts, and considerable sacrifices. That is the problem I would be glad to have you study. Some time must elapse before we can be in all respects ready to accomplish that purpose. Fleets are en route and armies in motion which have certain preliminary objects to accomplish, before we are ready to take Charleston in hand. But the time will before long arrive when I shall be prepared to make that movement. In the mean time, it is my advice aud wish that no attempt be made upon Savannah, unless it can be carried with certainty by a ' coup de main.' \"Please concentrate your attention and forces upon Pulaski and Fernandina. St. Augustine might as well be taken by way of au interlude, while awaiting the preparations for Charleston. Success attends us everywhere at present. \" Very truly, yours, \"GEO. B.

M'CLELLAN. 41 \"Headquarters of the Army, \" Washington, February 23, 1862. \" General : You are assigned to the command of the land forces destined to co-operate with the navy in the attacks upon New Orleans. You will use every means to keep your destination a profound secret, even from your staff officers, with the exception of your chief of staff, and Lieutenant Weitzell, of the engi neers. The force at your disposal will consist of the first thirteen regiments named in your memorandum handed to me in person, the 21st Indiana, 4th Wisconsin, and 6th Michigan, (old and good regiments from Baltimore.) \" The 21st Indiana, 4th Wisconsin, and 6th Michigan, will await your orders at Fort Monroe. \" Two companies of the 21st Indiana are well drilled as heavy artillery. The cavalry force already en route for Ship island will be sufficient for your purposes. \" After full consultation with officers well acquainted with the country in which it is proposed to operate, I have arrived at the conclusion that two (2) light batteries fully equipped, and one (1) without horses, will be all that are necessary. \" This will make your force about 14,400 infantry, 275 cavalry, 580 artillery; total, 15,255 men. The commanding general of the department of Key West is authorized to loan you, temporarily, two regiments ; Fort Pickens can, prob ably, give you another, which will bring your force to nearly 18,000. \" The object of your expedition is one of vital importance \u2014 the capture of New Orleans. The route selected is up the Mississippi river, and the first ob stacle to be encountered (perhaps the only one) is in the resistance offered by Forts St. Philip and Jackson. It is expected that the navy can reduce these works ; in that case you will, after their capture, leave a sufficient garrison in them to render them perfectly secure ; and it is recommended that, on the up ward passage, a few heavy guns and some troops be left at the pilot station (at the forks of the river) to cover a retreat in the event of a disaster. These troops and guns will, of course, be removed as soon as the forts are captured. \" Should the navy fail to reduce the works, you will land your forces and siege train, and endeavor to breach the works, silence their fire, and carry them by assault. \" The next resistance will be near the English Bend, where there are some earthen batteries. Here it may be necessary for you to land your troops and co operate with the naval attack, although it is more than probable that the navy, unassisted, can accomplish the result. If these works are taken, the city of New Orleans necessarily falls. In that event, it will probably be best to occupy Algiers with the mass of your troops, also the eastern bank of the river above the city. It may be necessary to place some troops in the city to preserve orderj but if there appears to be sufficient Union sentiment to control the city, it may be best for purposes of discipline to keep your men out of the city. \" After obtaining possession of New Orleans, it will be necessary to reduce all the works guarding its approaches from the east, and particularly to gain the Manchac pass. \" Baton Rouge, Berwick bay, and Fort Livingston, will next claim your attention. \" A feint on Galveston may facilitate the objects we have in view. I need not call your attention to the necessity of gaining possession of all the rolling stock you can on the different railways, and of obtaining control of the roads themselves. The occupation of Baton Rouge by a combined naval and land force should be accomplished as soon as possible after you have gained New Orleans. Then endeavor to open your communication with the northern column by the Mississippi, always bearing in mind the necessity of occupying Jackson, Mississippi, as soon as you can safely do so, either after or before you have"], [50, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 42 effected the junction. Allow nothing to divert you from obtaining full posses sion of all the approaches to New Orleans. When that object is accomplished to its fullest extent, it will be necessary to make a combined attack on Mobile, in order to gain possession of the harbor and works, as well as to control the railway terminus at the city. In regard to this, I will send nlore detailed in structions as the operations of the northern column develop themselves. \" I may briefly state that the general objects of the expedition are, first, the reduction of New Orleans and all its approaches; then Mobile and its defences; then Pensacola, Galveston, &c. It is probable that by the time New Orleans is reduced, it will be in the power of the government to re-enforce the land forces sufficiently to accomplish all these objects. In the mean time you will please give all the assistance in your power to the army and navy commanders in your vicinity, never losing sight of the fact that the great object to be achieved is the capture and firm retention of New Orleans. \" I am, &c, \"GEO. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding United States Army. \" Major General B. F. Butler, \" United States Volunteers.\" The plan indicated in the above letters comprehended in its scope the opera tions of all the armies of the Union, the army of the Potomac as well. It was my intention, for reasons easy to be seen, that its various parts should be carried out simultaneously, or nearly so, and in co-operation along the whole line. If this plan was wise \u2014 and events have failed to prove that it was not \u2014 then it is unnecessary to defend any delay which would have enabled the army of the Potomac to perform its share in the execution of the whole work. But about the middle of January, 1S62, upon recovering from a severe illness, I found that excessive anxiety for an immediate movement of the army of the Potomac had taken possession of the minds of the administration. A change had just been made in the War Department, and I was soon urged by the new secretary, Mr. Stanton, to take immediate steps to secure the re opening of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and to free the banks of the lower Potomac from the rebel batteries which annoyed passing vessels. Very soon after his entrance upon office I laid before him verbally my design as to the part of the plan of campaign to be executed by the army of the Poto mac, which was to attack Richmond by the lower Chesapeake. He instructed me to develop it to the President, which I did. The result was, that the Pres ident disapproved it, and by an order of January 31, 1862, substituted one of his own. On the 27th of January, 1862, the following order was issued with out consultation with me: [Present's General War Order No. 1 .] \"Executive Mansion, \" Washington, January 27, 1862. \" Ordered, That the 22d day of February, 1862, be the day for a general movement of the land and naval forces of the United States against the insur gent forces. That especially the army at and about Fortress Monroe, the army of the Potomac, the army of Western Virginia, the army near Munfordsville, Kentucky, the army and flotilla at Cairo, and a naval force in the Gulf of Mexico, be ready to move on that day. \" That all other forces, both land and naval, with their respective commanders, obey existing orders for the time, and be ready to obey additional orders when duly given. \" That the heads of departments, and especially the Secretaries of War"], [51, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 43 and of the Navy, with all their subordinates, and the general-in-chief, with all other commanders and subordinates of land and naval forces, will severally be held to their strict, and full responsibilities for prompt execution of this order. \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\" The order of January 31, 1862, was as follows : [President's Sptcial War Order N<>. 1.] \"Executive Mansion, \u2022 \" Washington, January 31, 1S62. \" Ordered, That all the disposable force of the army of the Potomac, after pro viding safely for the defence of Washington, be formed into an expedition for the immediate object of seizing and occupying a point upon the railroad south westward of what is known as Manassas Junction, all details to be in the dis cretion of the commander-in-chief, and the expedition to move before or on the 22d day of February next. \" ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\" I asked his excellency whether this order was to be regarded as final, or whether I could be permitted to submit in writing my objections to his plan, and my reasons for preferring my own. Permission was accorded, and I therefore prepared the letter to the Secretary of War which is given below. Before this had been submitted to the President, he addressed me the follow ing note : \"Executive Mansion, \" Washington, February 3, 1862. \"My Dear Sir: You and I have distinct and different plans fora movement of the army of the Potomac : yours to be done by the Chesapeake, up the Rap pahannock to Urbana, and across land to the terminus of the railroad on the York river ; mine to move directly to a point on the railroad southwest of Manassas. \"If you will give satisfactory answers to the following questions, I shall gladly yield my plan to yours : \" lst. Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time and money than mine? \"2d. Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine? \" 3d. Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine ? \"4th. In fact, would it not be less valuable in this : that it would break no great line of the. enemy's communications, while mine would ? 5th. In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult by your plan than mine ? \" Yours, truly, \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN. \"Major General McClellan.' ' These questions were substantially answered by the following letter of the same date to the Secretary of War : \"Headquarters of the Army, \" Washington, February 3, 1862. \" Sir : I ask your indulgence for the following paper, rendered necessary by circumstances. \" I assumed command of the troops in the vicinity of Washington on Satur day, July 27, 1861, six days after the battle of Bull run."], [52, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 44 \" I found no army to command ; a mere collection of regiments cowering on the banks of the Potomac, some perfectly raw, others dispirited by the recent defeat. \" Nothing of any consequence had been done to secure the southern approaches to the capital by means of defensive works; nothing whatever had been under taken to defend the avenues to the city on the northern side of the Potomac. \"The troops were not only undisciplined, undrilled, and dispirited; they were not even placed in military positions. The city was almost in a condition to have been taken by a dash of a regiment of cavalry. \" Without one day's delay I undertook the difficult task assigned to me; that task the honorable Secretary knows was given to me without solicitation or fore knowledge. How far I have accomplished it will best be shown by the past and the present. v \"The capital is secure against attack, the extensive fortifications erected by the labor of our troops enable a small garrison to hold it against a numerous army, the enemy have been held in check, the State of Maryland is securely in our possession, the detached counties of Virginia are again within tile pale of our laws, and all apprehension of trouble in Delaware is at an end ; the enemy are confined to the positions they occupied before the disaster of the 21st July. More than all this, I have now under my command a well-drilled and reliable army, to which the destinies of the country may be confidently committed. This army is young and untried in battle ; but it is animated by the highest spirit, and is capable of great deeds. . \"That so much has been accomplished and such an army created in so short a time, from nothing, will hereafter be regarded as one of the highest glories of the administration and the nation. \"Many weeks, I may say many months ago, this army of the Potomac was fully in condition to repel any attack; but there is a vast difference between that and the efficiency required to enable troops to attack successfully an army elated by victory and intrenched in a position long since selected, studied, and fortified. \" In the earliest papers I submitted to the President, I asked for an effective and movable force far exceeding the aggregate now on the banks of the Potomac. I have not the force I asked for. \"Even when in a subordinate position, I always looked beyond the opera tions of the army of the Potomac; 1 was never satisfied in my own mind with a barren victory, but looked to combined and decisive operations. \"When I was placed in command of the armies of the United States, I im mediately turned my attention to the whole field of operations, regarding the army of the Potomac as only one, while the most important, of the masses under my command. \"I confess that I did not then appreciate the total absence of a general plan which had before existed, nor did 1 know that utter disorganization and want of preparation pervaded the western armies. \" I took it for granted that they were nearly, if not quite, in condition to move towards the fulfilment of my plans. I acknowledge that I made a great mistake. \" 1 sent at once \u2014 with the approval of the Executive \u2014 officers I considered competent to command in Kentucky and Missouri. Their instructions looked to prompt movements. I soon found that the labor of creation and organization had to be performed there; transportation \u2014 arms \u2014 clothing \u2014 artillery \u2014 disci pline, all were wanting. These things required time to procure them. \"The generals in command have done their work most creditably, but we are still delayed. I had hoped that a general advance could be made during the good weather of December ; I was mistaken. \"My wish was to gain possession of the Eastern Tennessee railroad, as a pre-"], [53, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 45 liminary movement, then to follow it up immediately by an attack on Nashville and Richmond, as nearly at the same time as possible. \" I have ever regarded our true policy as being that of fully preparing our selves, and then seeking for the most decisive results. I do not wish to waste life in useless battles, but prefer to strike at the heart. \" Two bases of operations seem to present themselves for the advance of the army of the Potomac : \"I. That of Washington \u2014 its present position \u2014 involving a direct attack upon the intrenched positions of the enemy at Centreville, Manassas, &c, or else a movement to turn one or both flanks of those positions, or a combination of the two plans. \" The relative force of the two armies will not justify an attack on both flanks ; an attack on his left flank alone involves a long line of wagon communication, and cannot prevent him from collecting for the decisive battle all the detach ments now on his extreme right and left. \" Should we attack his right flank by the line of the Occ6quan, and a crossing of the Potomac below that river, and near his batteries, we could perhaps pre vent the junction of the enemy's right with his centre, (we might destroy the former ; ) we would remove the obstructions to the navigation of the Potomac, reduce the length of wagon transportation by establishing new depots at the nearest points of the Potomac, and strike more directly his main railway com munication. \"The fords of the Oceoquan below the mouth of the Bull run are watched by the rebels ; batteries are said to be placed on the heights in the rear, (con cealed by the woods,) and the arrangement of his troops is such that he can op pose some considerable resistance to a passage of that stream. Information has just been received, to the effect that the enemy are intrenching a line of heights extending from the vicinity of Sangster's (Union mills) towards Evans port. Early in January, Spriggs's ford was occupied by General Rhodes, with 3,600 men aud eight (8) guns; there are strong reasons for believing that Davis's ford is occupied. These circumstances indicate or prove that the enemy anticipates the movement in question, and is prepared to resist it. Assuming for the present that this operation is determined upon, it may be well to ex amine briefly its probable progress. In the present state of affairs, our column (for the movement of so large a force must be made in several columns, at least five or six) can reach the Accatinck without danger; during the march thence to the Oceoquan, our right flank becomes exposed to an attack from Fairfax sta tion, Sangster's, and Union mills. This danger must be met by occupying in some force either the two first named places, or better, the point of junction of the roads leading thence to the village of Oceoquan ; this occupation must be continued so long as we continue to draw supplies by the roads from this city, or until a battle is won. \" The crossing of the Oceoquan should be made at all the fords from Wolf s run to the mouth; the points of crossing not being necessarily confined to the fords themselves. Should the enemy occupy this line in force, we must, with what assistance the flotilla can afford, endeavor to force the passage near the mouth, thus forcing the enemy to abandon the whole line, or be taken in flank himself. \"Having gained the line of the Oceoquan, it would be necessary to throw a colifmn by the shortest route to Dumfries; partly to force the enemy to abandon his batteries on the Potomac; partly to cover our left flank against an attack from the direction of Aquia; and lastly, to establish our communications with tho river by the best roads, and thus give us new depots. The enemy would by this time have occupied the line of the Oceoquan above Bull run, holding Brentsville in force, and perhaps extending his lines somewhat further to the southwest. \"Our next step would then be to prevent the enemy from crossing the Occo-"], [54, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 46 quan between Bull run and Broad run, to fall upon our right flank while mov ing on Brentsville. This might be effected by occupying Bacon Race church and the cross-roads near the mouth of Bull run, or still more effectually by moving to the fords themselves, and preventing him from debouching on our side. \"These operations would possibly be resisted, and it would require some time to effect them, as, nearly at the same time as possible, we should gain the fords necessary to our purposes above Broad run. Having secured our right flank, it would become necessary to carry Brentsville at any cost, for we could not leave it between the right flank and the main body. The final movement on the railroad must be determined by circumstances existing at the time. \"This brief sketch brings out in bold relief the great advantage possessed by the enemy in the strong central position he occupies, with roads diverging in every direction, and a strong line of defence enabling him to remain on the de fensive, with a small force on one flank, while he concentrates everything on the other for a decisive action. \" Should we place a portion of our force in front of Centreville, while the rest crosses the Oceoquan, we commit the error of dividing our army by a very difficult obstacle, and by a distance too great to enable the two parts to support each other, should either be attacked by the masses of the enemy, -while the other is held in check. \" I should perhaps have dwelt more decidedly on the fact that the force left near Sangster's must be allowed to remain somewhere on that side of the Oceo quan until the decisive battle is over, so as to cover our retreat iu the event of disaster, unless it should be decided to select and intrench a new base some where near Dumfries \u2014 a proceeding involving much time. \"After the passage of the Oceoquan by the main army, this covering force could be drawn into a more central and less exposed position \u2014 say Brimstone hill or nearer the Oceoquan. In this latitude the weather will for a consider able period be very uncertain, aud a movement commenced in force on roads in tolerably firm condition will be liable, almost certain, to be much delayed by rains and snow. It will, therefore, be next to impossible to surprise the enemy, or take him at a disadvantage by rapid man\u0153uvres. Our slow progress will en able him to divine our purposes, and take his measures accordingly. The probability is, from the best information we possess, that the enemy has improved the roads leading to his lines of defence, while we have to work as we advance. \"Bearing in mind what has been said, and the present unprecedented and im passable condition of the roads, it will be evident that no precise period can be fixed upon for the movement on this line. Nor can its duration be closely cal culated; it seems certain that many weeks may elapse before it is possible to commence the march. Assuming the success of this operation, and the defeat of the enemy as certain, the question at once arises as to the importance of the results gained. I think these results would be confined to the possession of the field of battle, the evacuation of the line of the upper Potomac by the enemy, and the moral effect of the victory ; important results, it is true, but not decisive of the war, nor securing the destruction of the enemy's main army, for he could fall back upon other positions, and fight us again and again, should the condition of his troops permit. If he is in no condition to fight us again out of the range of the intrenchments at Richmond, we would find it a very difficult and tedious matter to follow him up there, for he would destroy his railroad bridges and otherwise impede our progress through a region where the roads are as bad as they well can be, and we would probably find ourselves forced at last to change the whole theatre of war, or to seek a shorter land route to Richmond, with a smaller available force, and at an expenditure of ftiuch more time, than were we to adopt the Bhort line at once. We would also have forced the enemy to concentrate his forces and perfect his defensive measures at the very points. where it is desirable to strike him when least prepared."], [55, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 47 \" II. The second base of operations available for the army of the Potomac is that of the lower Chesapeake bay, which affords the shortest possible land route to Richmond, and strikes directly at the heart of the enemy's power in the east. \" The roads in that region are passable at all seasons of the year. \"The country now alluded to is much more favorable for offensive operations than that in front of Washington, (which is very unfavorable,) much more level, more cleared land, the woods less dense, the soil more sandy, and the spring some two or three weeks earlier. A movement in force on that line obliges the enemy to abandon his intrenched position at Manassas, in order to hasten to cover Richmond and Norfolk. He must do this; for should he permit us to occupy Richmond, his destruction can be averted only by entirely defeating us in a battle, in which he must be the assailant. This movement, if successful, gives us the capital, the communications, the supplies of the rebels; Norfolk would fall; all the waters of the Chesapeake would be ours; all Virginia would be in our power, and the enemy forced to abandon Tennessee and North Caro lina. The alternative presented to the enemy would be, to beat us in a posi tion selected by ourselves, disperse, or pass beneath the Candine forks. \" Should we be beaten in a battle, we have a perfectly secure retreat down the Peninsula upon Fort Monroe, with our flanks perfectly covered by the fleet. \"During the whole movement our left flank is covered by the water. Our right is secure, for the reason that the enemy is too distant to reach us in time ; he can only oppose us in front; we bring our fleet into full play. \"After a successful battle our position would be \u2014 Burnside forming our left \u2014 Norfolk held securely \u2014 our centre connecting' Burnside with Buell, both by Raleigh and Lynchburg \u2014 Buell in Eastern Tennessee and North Alabama \u2014 Halleck at Nashville and Memphis. \" The next movement would be to connect with Sherman on the left, by re ducing Wilmington and Charleston; to advance our centre into South Carolina and Georgia; to push Buell either towards Montgomery, or to unite with the main army in Georgia; to throw Halleck southward to meet the naval expedi tion from New Orleans. \" We should then be in a condition to reduce at our leisure all the southern seaports ; to occupy all the avenues of communication ; to use the great outlet of the Mississippi ; to re-establish our government and arms in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas ; to force the slaves to labor for our subsistence, instead of that of the rebels ; to bid defiance to all foreign interference. Such is the object I have ever had in view \u2014 this is the general plan which I hope to accomplish. \" For many long months I have labored to prepare the army of the Potomac to play its part in the programme ; from the day when I was placed in com- mand of all our armies, I have exerted myself to place all the other armies in such a condition that they, too, could perform their allotted duties. \" Should it be determined to operate from the lower Chesapeake, the point of landing which promises the most brilliant result is Urbana, on the lower Rap- pahannock. This point is easily reached by vessels of heavy draught ; it is neither occupied nor observed by the enemy \u2014 it is but one march from West Point, the key of that region, and thence but two marches to Richmond. A rapid movement from Urbana would probably cut off Magruder in the Penin- sula, and enable us to occupy Richmond, before it could be strongly re-enforced. Should we fail in that, we could, with the co-operation of the navy, cross the James and throw ourselves in rear of Richmond, thus forcing the enemy to come out and attack us, for his position would be untenable, with us on the southern bank of the river. \" Should circumstances render it not advisable to land at Urbana, we can use Mobjack bay ; or, the worst coming to the worst, we can take Fort Monroe"], [56, "48 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. as a base, and operate with complete security, although with less celerity and brilliancy of results, up the Peninsula. \"To reach whatever point may be selected as a base, a large amount of cheap water transportation must be collected, consisting mainly of canal-boats, barges, wood-boats, schooners, &c, towed by small steamers, all of a very different character from those required for all previous expeditions. This can certainly be accomplished within thirty days from the time the order is given. I propose, as the best possible plan that can, in my judgment, be adopted, to select Urbana as a lauding place for the first detachments ; to transport by water four divis ions of infantry with their batteries, the regular infantry, a few wagons, one bridge train and a few squadrons of cavalry, making the vicinity of Hooker's position the place of embarkation for as many as possible ; to move the regu lar cavalry and reserve artillery, the remaining bridge trains and wagons, to a point somewhere near Cape Lookout, then ferry them over the river by means of North River ferry-boats, march them over to the Rappahannock, (covering the movement by an infantry force near Heathsville,) and to cross the Rappa hannock in a similar way. The expense and difficulty of the movement will then be very much diminished, (a saving of transportation of about 10,000 horses,) and the result none the less certain. \" The concentration of the cavalry, &c, on the lower counties of Maryland can be effected without exciting suspicion, and the movement made without delay from that cause. \" This movement, if adopted, will not at all expose the city of Washington to danger. \" The total force to be thrown upon the new line would be, according to circumstances, from 110,000 to 140,000. I hope to use the latter number by bringing fresh troops into Washington, and still leaving it quite safe. I fully realize that in all projects offered, time will probably be the most valuable consideration. It is my decided opinion that, iu that point of view, the second plan should be adopted. It is possible, nay, highly probable, that the weather and state of the roads may be such as to delay the direct movement from Wash ington, with its unsatisfactory results and great risks, far beyond the time required to complete the second plan. In the first case we can fix no definite time for an advance. The roads have gone from bad to worse. Nothing like their present condition was ever known here before ; they are impassable at present. We are entirely at the mercy of the weather. It is by no means certain that we can beat them at Manassas. On the other line I regard success as certain by all the chances of war. We demoralize the enemy by forcing him to abandon his prepared position for one which we have chosen, in which all is in our favor, and where success must produce immense results. \" My judgment, as a general, is clearly in favor of this project. Nothing is certain in war, but all the chances are in favor of this movement. So much am I in favor of the southern line of operations, that I would prefer the move from Fortress Monroe as a base \u2014 as a certain though less brilliant movement than that from Urbana, to an attack upon Manassas. \"I know that his excellency the President, you, and I, all agree in our wishes ; and that these wishes are, to bring this war to a close as promptly as the means in our possession will permit. I believe that the mass of the people have entire confidence in us \u2014 I am sure of it. Let us, then, look only to the great result to be accomplished, and disregard everything else. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, \"GEO. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding. 'Hon. E. M.

Many verbal conferences ensued, in which, among other things, it was determined to collect as many canal-boats as possible, with a view to employ them largely in the transportation of the army to the lower Chesapeake. The idea was at one time entertained by the President to use them in forming a bridge across the Potomac near Liverpool point, in order to throw the army over that point ; but this was subsequently abandoned. It was also found by experience that it would require much time to prepare the canal boats for use in transportation, to the extent that had been anticipated. Finally, on the 27th of February, 1862, the Secretary of War, by the au thority of the President, instructed Mr. John Tucker, Assistant Secretary of War, to procure at once the necessary steamers and sailing craft to transport the army of the Potomac to its new field of operatious. The following extract from the report of Mr. Tucker, dated April 5, will show the nature and progress of this well-executed service : #** * * # # * ## \" I was called to Washington by telegraph, on 17th January last, by Assistant Secretary of War Thomas A. Scott. I was informed that Major General McClellan wished to see me. From him I learned that he desired to know if transportation on smooth water could be obtained to move at one time, for a short distance, about 50,000 troops, 10,000 horses, 1,000 wagons, 13 batteries, and the usual equipment of such an army. He frankly stated to me that he had always supposed such a movement entirely feasible, until two experienced quartermasters had recently reported it impracticable, in their judgment. A few days afterwards, I reported to General McClellan that I was entirely confident the transports could be commanded, and stated the mode by which his object could be accomplished. A week or two afterwards I had the honor of an inter view with the President and General McClellan, when the subject was further discussed, and especially as to the time required. \"I expressed the opinion that, as the movement of the horses and wagons would have to be made chiefly by schooners and barges, that as each schooner would require to be properly fitted for the protection of the horses, and furnished with a supply of water and forage, and each transport for the troops provided with water, I did not deem it prudent to assume that such an expedition could start within thirty days from the time the order was given. \" The President and General McClellan both urgently stated the vast import ance of an earlier movement. I replied that if favorable winds prevailed, and there was great despatch in loading, the time might be materially diminished. \"On the 14th February you (Secretary of War) advertised for transports of various descriptions, inviting bids on the 27th February. I was informed that the proposed movement by water was decided upon. That evening the Quarter master General was informed of the decision. Directions were given to secure the transportation \u2014 any assistance was tendered. He promptly detailed to this duty two most efficient assistants in his department. Colonel Rufus Iugalls was stationed at Annapolis, where it was then proposed to embark the troops, and Captain Henry C. Hodges was directed to meet me in Philadelphia, to attend to chartering the vessels. With these arrangements I left Washington on the 2Sth February. \" I beg to hand herewith a statement, prepared by Captain Hodges, of the vessels chartered, which exhibits the prices paid, and parties from whom they were taken : 113 steamers, at an average price per day $215 10 188 schooners, \" \" \" 24 45 88 barges, \" \" \" 14 27 H. Ex.

The only loss of which I have heard is eight mules and nine barges, which latter went ashore in a gale within a few miles of Fort Monroe \u2014 the cargoes being saved. With this trifling exception, not the slightest accident has occurred, to my knowledge. \" I respectfully, but confidently, submit that, for economy and celerity of movement, this expedition is without a parallel on record. -_.\u2022_> * __\u2022 * * * \"JOHN TUCKER, \"Assistant Secretary of War.\" In the mean time the destruction of the batteries on the lower Potomac, by crossing our troops opposite them, was considered, and preparations were even made for throwing Hooker'3 division across the river, to carry them by assault. Finally, however, after an adverse report from Brigadier General J. G. Barnard, Chief Engineer, given below, who made a reconnoissance of the positions, and in view of the fact that it was still out of the power of the Navy Department to furnish suitable vessels to co -operate with land troops, this plan was abandoned as impracticable. A close examination of the enemy's wrorks and their approaches, made after they were evacuated, showed that the decision was a wise one. The only means, therefore, of accomplishing the capture of these works, so much desired by the President, was by a movement by land, from the left of our lines, on the right bank of the Potomac \u2014 a movement obviously unwise. The attention of the Navy Department, as early as August 12, 1861, had been called to the necessity of maintaining a strong force of efficient war vessels on the Potomac. \"Headquarters Division of the Potomac, \"Washington, August 12, 1861. \" Sir : I have to-day received additional information -which convinces me that it is more than probable that the enemy will, within a very short time, attempt to throw a respectable force from the mouth of Aquia creek into Maryland. This attempt will probably be preceded by the erection of batteries at Matthias and White House points. Such a movement on the part of the enemy, in con nexion with others probably designed, would place Washington in great jeopardy. I most earnestly urge that the strongest possible naval force be at once concen trated near the mouth of Aquia creek, and that the most vigilant watch be maintained day and night, so as to render such passage of the river absolutely impossible. \" I recommend that the Minnesota and any other vessels available from Hampton Roads be at once ordered up there, and that a great quantity of coal be sent to that vicinity, sufficient for several weeks' supply. At least one strong war vessel should be kept at Alexandria, and I again urge the concentration of a strong naval force on the Potomac without delay. \" If the Naval Department will render it absolutely impossible for the enemy to cross the river below Washington, the security of the capital will be greatly increased. \" I cannot too earnestly urge an immediate compliance with these requests. \" I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, \" GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, \"Majm- General Commanding. \" Hon. Gideon Welles, \"Secretary of the United States Navy.\""], [59, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 51 It was on the 27th of September, 1861, that General Barnard, Chief Engineer, in company with Captain Wyman of the Potomac flotilla, had been instructed to make a reconnoissance of the enemy's batteries as far as Matthias point. In his report of his observations he says : \" Batteries at High point and Cockpit point, and thence down to Chopa wampsic, cannot be prevented. We may, indeed, prevent their construction on cer tain points, but along here somewhere the enemy can establish, in spite of us, as many batteries as he chooses. What is the remedy ? Favorable circumstances, not to be anticipated nor made the basis of any calculations, might justify and render successful the attack of a particular battery. To suppose that we can capture all, and by mere attacks of this kind prevent the navigation being molested, is very much the same as to suppose that the hostile army in our own front can prevent us building and maintaining field-works to protect Arlington and Alexandria by capturing them, one and all, as fast as they are built.\" In another communication upon the subject of crossing troops for the purpose of destroying the batteries on the Virginia side of the Potomac, General Bar nard says : \" The operation involves the forcing of a very strong line of defence of the enemy, and all that we would have to do if we were really opening a campaign against them there. \" It is true we hope to force this line by turning it, by landing on Freestone point. With reason to believe that this may be successful, it cannot be denied that it involves a risk of failure. Should we, then, considering all the conse quences which may be involved, enter into the operation, merely to capture the Potomac batteries ? I think not. Will not the Ericsson, assisted by one other gunboat capable of keeping alongside these batteries, so far control their fire as to keep the navigation sufficiently free as long as we require it ? Captain Wy man says yes.\" It was the opinion of competent naval officers, and I concur with them, that had an adequate force of strong and well-armed vessels been acting on the Po tomac from the beginning of August, it would have been next to impossible for the rebels to have constructed or maintained batteries upon the banks of the river. The enemy never occupied Matthias point, nor any other point on the river, which was out of supporting distance from the main army. When the enemy commenced the construction of these batteries, the army of the Potomac was not in a condition to prevent it. Their destruction by our army would have afforded but a temporary relief unless we had been strong enough to hold the entire line of the Potomac. This could be done either by driving the enemy from Manassas and Aquia creek, by main force, or by ma n\u0153uvring to compel them to vacate their positions. The latter course was finally pursued, and with success. About the 20th of February, 1862, additional measures were taken to secure the reopening of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad. The preliminary operations of General Lander for this object are elsewhere described. I had often observed to the President and to members of the cabinet that the reconstruction of this railway could not be undertaken until we were in a con dition to fight a battle to secure it. I regarded the possession of Winchester and Strasburg as necessary to cover the railway in the rear, and it was not till the month of February that I felt prepared to accomplish this very desirable but not vital purpose. The whole of Banks's division and two brigades of Scdgwick's division were thrown across the river at Harper's Ferry, leaving one brigade of Sedgwick's division to observe and guard the Potomac from Great Falls to the mouth of the Monocacy. A sufficient number of troops of all arms were held in readiness iu the vicinity of Washington, either to march via Leesburg or to move by rail"], [60, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 52 to Harper's Ferry, should this become necessary in carrying out the objects in view. The subjoined notes from a communication subsequently addressed to the War Department will sufficiently explain the conduct of these operations. NOTES. \" When I started for Harper's Ferry, I plainly stated to the President and Secretary of War that the chief object of the operation would be to open the Baltimore and Ohio railroad by crossing the river in force ut Harper's Ferry ; that I had collected the material for making a permanent bridge by means of canal-boats ; that from the nature of the river, it was doubtful whether such a bridge could be constructed ; that if it could not, I would at least occupy the ground in front of Harper's Ferry, in order to cover the rebuilding of the rail road bridge ; and finally, when the communications were perfectly secure, move on Winchester. \"When I arrived at the place I found the bateau bridge nearly completed ; the holding-ground proved better than had been anticipated ; the weather was favorable, there being no wind. I at once crossed over the two brigades which had arrived, and took steps to hurry up the other two, belonging respectively to Banks's and Sedgwick's divisions. The difficulty of crossing supplies had not then become apparent. That night I telegraphed for a regiment of regular cavalry and four batteries of heavy artillery to come up the next day, (Thurs day,) besides directing Keyes's division of infantry to be moved up on Friday. \"Next morning the attempt was made to pass the canal-boats through the lift-lock, in order to commence at once the construction of a permanent bridge. It was then found for the first time that the lock was too small to permit the passage of the boats, it having been built for a class of boats ruuning on the Shenandoah canal, and too narrow by some four or six inches for the canal boats. The lift-locks, above and below, are all large enough for the ordinary boats. I had seen them at Edwards's ferry thus used. It had always been represented to the engineers by the military railroad employes, and others, that the lock teas large enough, and, the difference being too small to be detected by the eye, no one had thought of measuring it, or suspecting any difficulty. I thus suddenly found myself unable to build the permanent bridge. A violent gale had arisen, which threatened the safety of our only means of communication ; the narrow approach to the bridge was so crowded and clogged with wagons that it was very clear that, under existing circumstances, nothing more could be done than to cross over the baggage and supplies of the two brigades. Of the others, instead of being able to cross both during the morning, the last arrived only in time to go over just before dark. It was evident that the troops under orders would only be in the way, should they arrive, and that it would not be possible to subsist them for a rapid march on Winchester. It was therefore deemed necessary to countermand the order, content ourselves with covering the reopen ing of the railroad for the present, and in the mean time use every exertion to establish, as promptly as possible, depots of forage and subsistence on the Vir ginia side, to supply the troops, and enable them to move on Winchester inde pendently of the bridge. The next day (Friday) I sent a strong reconnoissance to Charlestown, and, under its protection, went there myself. I then determined to hold that place, and to move the troops composing Lander's and Williams's commands at once on Martinsburg and Bunker Hill, thus effectually covering the reconstruction of the railroad. \"Having done this, and taken all the steps in my power to insure the rapid transmission of supplies over the river, 1 returned to this city, well satisfied with what had been accomplished. While up the river I learned that the President was dissatisfied with the state of affairs; but, on my return here."], [61, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. ll'CLELLAN. 53 understood from the Secretary of War that upon learning the whole state of thecase the President was fully satisfied. I contented myself, therefore, with giving to the Secretary a brief statement, as I have written here.\" The design aimed at was entirely compassed, and before the first of April, the date of my departure for the Peninsula, the railroad was in running order. As a demonstration upon the left flank of the enemy, this movement no doubt assisted in determining the evacuation of his lines on the 8th and 9th of March. On my return from Harper's Ferry, on the 28th of February, the prepara tions necessary to carry out the wishes of the President and Secretary of War in regard to destroying the batteries on the lower Potomac weje at once under taken. Mature reflection convinced me that this operation would require the movement of the entire army, for I felt sure that the enemy would resist it with his whole strength. I undertook it with great reluctance, both on account of the extremely unfavorable condition of the roads and my firm conviction that the proposed movement to the lower Chesapeake would necessarily, as it subse quently did, force the enemy to abandon all his positions in front of Washing ton. Besides, it did not forward my plan of campaign to precipitate this evacua tion by any direct attack, nor to subject the army to any needless loss of life and material by a battle near Washington, which could produce no decisive results. The preparations for a movement towards the Oceoquan, to carry the batteries, were, however, advanced as rapidly as the season permitted, and I had invited the commanders of divisions to meet at headquarters on the 8th of March, for the purpose of giving them their instructions, and receiving their advice and opinion in regard to their commands, when an interview with the President indicated to me the possibility of a change in my orders. His excellency sent for me at a very early hour on the morning of the 8th, and renewed his expressions of dissatisfaction with the affair of Harper's Ferry, and with my plans for the new movement down the Chesapeake. Another recital of the same facts which had before given satisfaction to his excellency again produced, <>s I supposed, the same result. The views which I expressed to the President were re-enforced by the result of a meeting of my general officers at headquarters. At that meeting my plans were laid before the division commanders, and were approved by a majority of those present. Nevertheless, on the same day two important orders were issued by the President, without consultation with me. The first of these was the gene ral war order No. 2, directing the formation of army corps, and assigning their commanders. I had always been in favor of the principle of an organization into army corps, but preferred deferring its practical execution until some little experience in campaign and on the field of battle should show what general officers were most competent to exercise these high commands, for it must be remembered that we then had no officers whose experience in war on a large scale was suf ficient to prove that they possessed the necessary qualifications. An incompe tent commander of an army corps might cause irreparable damage, while it is not probable that an incompetent division commander could cause any very se rious mischief. These views had frequently been expressed by me to the Pres ident and members of the cabinet; it was therefore with as much regret as sur prise that I learned the existence of this order. The first order has been given above ; the second order was as follows : [President's General War Order No. 3.] \" Executive Mansion, \" Washington, March 8, 1S62. \" Ordered, That no change of the base of operations of the army of the Potomac shall be made without leaving in and about Washington such a force"], [62, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 54 as, in the opinion of the general-in-chief and the commanders of army corps, shall leave said city entirely secure. \" That no more than two army corps (about fifty thousand troops) of said army of the Potomac shall be moved en route for a new base of operations until the navigation of the Potomac, from Washington to the Chesapeake bay, shall be freed from enemy's batteries, and other obstructions, or until the Presi dent shall hereafter give express permission. \" That any movement'as aforesaid, en route for a new base of operations, which may be ordered by the general-in-chief, and which may be intended to move upon the Chesapeake bay, shall begin to move upon the bay as early as the 18th March instant, and the general-in-chief shall be responsible that it moves as early as that day. \" Ordered, That the army and navy co-operate in an immediate effort to cap ture the enemy's batteries upon the Potomac between Washington and the Chesapeake bay. \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN. , \" L. Thomas, Adjutant General. \" After what has been said already in regard to the effect of a movement to the lower Chesapeake it is unnecessary for me to comment upon this document, fur ther than to say that the time of beginning the movement depended upon the state of readiness of the transports, the entire control of which had been placed by the Secretary of War in the hands of one of the Assistant Secretaries, and not under the Quartermaster General ; so that even if the movement were not impeded by the condition imposed, in regard to the batteries on the Potomac, it could not have been in my power to begin it before the 18th of March, unless the Assistant Secretary of War had completed his arrangements by that time. Meanwhile important events were occurring which materially modified the designs for the subsequent campaign. The appearance of the Merrimack off Old Point Comfort, and the encounter with the United States squadron on the 8th of March, threatened serious derangement of the plan for the Peninsula movement. But the engagement between the Monitor and Merrimack on the 9th of March demonstrated so satisfactorily the power of the former, and the other naval preparations were so extensive and formidable, that the security of Fort Monroe, as a base of operations, was placed beyond a doubt ; and although the James river was closed to us, the York river, with its tributaries, was still open as a line of water communication with the fortress. The general plan, there fore, remained undisturbed, although less promising in its details than when the James river was in our control. On Sunday, the 9th of March, information from various sources made it ap parent that the enemy was evacuating his positions at Centreville and Manassas, as well as on the upper and lower Potomac. The President and Secretary of War were present when the most positive information reached me, and I ex pressed to them my intention to cross the river immediately, and there gain the most authentic information, prior to determining what course to pursue. The retirement of the enemy towards Richmond had been expected as the natural consequence of the movement to the Peninsula, but the adoption of this course immediately on ascertaining that such a movement was intended, while it relieved me from the results of the undue anxiety of my superiors, and attested the character of the design, was unfortunate in that the then almost impassable roads between our positions and theirs deprived us of the oppor tunity for inflicting damage usually afforded by the withdrawal of a large army in the face of a powerful adversary. The retirement of the enemy and the occupation of the abandoned positions which necessarily followed presented an opportunity for the troops to gain some experience on the march and bivouac preparatory to the campaign, and to"], [63, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 55 get rid of the superfluous baggage and other \" impediments\" which accumulate so easily around an army encamped for a long time in one locality. A march to Manassas and back would produce no delay in embarking for the lower Chesapeake, as the transports could not be ready for some time, and it afforded a good intermediate step between the quiet aud comparative comfort of the camps around Washington, and the rigors of active operations, besides accomplishing the important object of determining the positions and perhaps the future designs of the enemy, with the possibility of being able to harass their rear. I therefore issued orders during the night of the 9th of March for a general movement of the army the next morning towards Centreville and Manassas, sending in advance two regiments of cavalry under Colonel Averill with orders to reach Manassas if possible, ascertain the exact condition of affairs, and do whatever he could to retard and annoy the enemy if really in retreat ; at the same time I telegraphed to the Secretary of War that it would be necessary to defer the organization of the army corps until the completion of the projected advance upon Manassas, as the divisions could not be brought together in time. The Secretary replied, requiring immediate compliance with the President's order; but on my again representing that this would compel the abandonment or postponement of the movement to Manassas, he finally consented to its post ponement. At noon on the 10th of March the cavalry advance reached the enemy's lines at Centreville, passing through his recently occupied camps and works, and find ing still burning heaps of military stores and much valuable property. Immediately after being assigned to the command of the troops around Wash ington, I organized a secret service force, under Mr. E. J. Allen, a very ex perienced and efficient person. This force, up to the time I was relieved from command, was continually occupied in procuring from all possible sources in formation regarding the strength, positions, and movements of the enemy. All spies, \"'contrabands,\" deserters, refugees, and many prisoners of war, coming into our lines from the front, were carefully examined, first by the out post and division commanders, and then by my chief of staff and the Provost Mar shal General. Their statements, taken in writing, and in many cases under oath, from day to day, for a long period previous to the evacuation of Manassas, com prised a mass of evidence which, by careful digests and collations, enabled me to estimate with considerable accuracy the strength of the enemy before us. Summaries showing the character and results of the labors of the secret service force accompany this report, and I refer to them for the facts they contain, and as a measure of the ignorance which led some journals at that time, and persons in high office, unwittingly to trifle with the reputation of an army, and to delude the country with quaker gun stories of the defences and gross understatements of the numbers of the enemy. The following orders were issued for the examination of persons coming from the direction of the enemy : [\"Circular.] \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Washington, December 16, 1861. \"The major general commanding directs that hereafter all deserters, prisoners. spies, 'contrabands,' and all other persons whatever coming or brought within our lines from Virginia, shall be taken immediately to the quarters of the com mander.of the division within whose lines they may come or be brought, without previous examination by any one, except so far as may be necessary for the officer commanding tke advance guard to elicit information regarding his particu lar post; that the division commander examine all such persons himself, or dele-"], [64, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 56 gate such duty to a proper officer of his staff, and allow no other persons to hold any communication with them ; that he then immediately send them, with a suf ficient guard, to the provost marshal in this city for further examination and safe-keeping, and that stringent orders be given to all guards having such per sons in charge not to hold any communication with them whatever ; and further, that the information elicited from such persons shall be immediately communi cated to the major general commanding, or to the chief of staff, and to no other person whatever. \"The major general commanding further directs that a sufficient guard be placed around every telegraph station pertaining to this army, and that such guards be instructed not to allow any person, except the regular telegraph corps, general officers, and such staff officers as may be authorized by their chief, to enter or loiter around said stations within hearing of the sound of the telegraph instruments. \"By command of Major General McClellan. \" S. WILLIAMS, \" Assistant Adjutant General.\" \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Washington, February 26, 1862. \"General Order ) No. 27. ( \"All deserters from the enemy, prisoners, and other persons coming within our lines, will be taken at once to the provost marshalAf the nearest division, who will examine them in presence of the division commander or an officer of his staff designated for the purpose. This examination will only refer to such information as may affect the division and those near it, especially those remote from general headquarters. \" As soon as this examination is completed \u2014 and it must be made as rapidly as possible \u2014 the person will be sent, under proper guard, to the Provost Marshal General, with a statement of his replies to the questions asked. Upon receiving him, the Provost Marshal General will at once send him, with his statement, to the chief of staff of the artny of the Potomac, who will cause the necessary examination to be made. The Provost Marshal General will have the custody of all such persons. Division commanders will at once communicate to other division commanders all information thus obtained which affects them. **#*##\u00bb# * \"By command of Major General McClellan. \"S. WILLIAMS, \"Assistant Adjutant General.\" In addition to the foregoing orders, the division commanders were instructed, whenever they desired to send out scouts towards the enemy, to make known the object at headquarters, in order that I might determine whether we had the information it was proposed to obtain, and that I might give the necessary or ders to other commanders, so that the scouts should not be molested by the guards. It will be seen from the report of the chief of the secret service corps, dated March 8, that the forces of the rebel army of the Potomac, at that date, were as follows : At Manassas, Centreville, Bull run, Upper Oceoquan, and vicinity. 80,000 men. At Brooks's station, Dumfries, Lower Oceoquan, and vicinity. . . . 18,000 men."], [65, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 57 At Leesburg and vicinity 4,500 men. In the Shenandoah valley 13,000 men. 115,500 men. About three hundred field guns and from twenty-six to thirty siege guns were\" with the rebel army in front of Washington. The report made on the 17th of March, after the evacuation of Manassas and Centreville, corroborates the statements contained in the report of the 8th, and is fortified by the affida vits of several railroad engineers, constructors, baggage-masters, &c, whose opportunities for forming correct estimates were unusually good. These affida vits will be found in the accompanying reports of the chief of the secret service corps. A reconnoissance of the works at Centreville made by Lieutenant McAlester, United States engineers, on March 14, 1862, and a survey of those at Manassas, made by a party of the United States coast survey, in April, 1862, confirmed also my conclusions as to the strength of the enemy's defences. Those at Centreville consisted of two lines, one facing east and the other north. The former consisted of seven works, viz: one bastion fort, two redoubts, two lunettes, and two batteries; all containing embrasures for forty guns, and con nected by infantry parapets and double caponieres. It extended along the crest of the ridge a mile and three-quarters from its junction with the northern front to ground thickly wooded and impassable to an attacking column. The northern front extended about one and one-fourth mile to Great Rocky run, and thence three-fourths of a mile further to thickly wooded, impassable ground in the valley of Cub run. It consisted of six lunettes and batteries with embrasures for thirty -one guns, connected by an infantry parapet in the form of a cremaillere line with redans. At the town of Centreville, on a high hill com manding the rear of all the works within range, was a large hexagonal redoubt with ten embrasures. Manassas station was defended in all directions by a system of detached works, with platforms for heavy guns arranged for marine carriages, and often connected by infantry parapets. This system was rendered complete by a very large work, with sixteen embrasures, which commanded the highest of the other works by about fifty feet. Sketches of the reconnoissances above referred to will be found among the maps appended to this report. From this it will be seen that the positions selected by the enemy at Centre ville and Manassas were naturally very strong, with impassable streams and broken ground, affording ample protection for their flanks, and that strong lines of intrenchments swept all the available approaches. Although the history of every former war has conclusively shown the great advantages which are possessed by an army acting on the defensive and occu pying strong positions, defended by heavy earthworks ; yet, at the commence ment of this war, but few civilians fn our country, and, indeed, not all military men of rank, had a just appreciation of the fact. New levies that have never been in battle cannot be expected to advance without cover under the murderous fire from such defences, and carry them by assault. This is work in which veteran troops frequently falter and are re pulsed with loss. That an assault of the enemy's positions in front of Washing ton, with the new troops composing the army of the Potomac, during the winter of 1861-'62, would have resulted in defeat and demoralization, was too probable. The same army, though inured to war in many battles, hard fought and bravely won, has twi.ee, under other generals, suffered such disasters as it was no excess of prudence then to avoid. My letter to the Secretary of War, dated"], [66, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE R. M'CLELLAN. 58 February 3, 1862, and given above, expressed the opinion that the movement to the Peninsula would compel the enemy to retire from his position at Manas sas and free Washington from danger. When the enemy first learned of that plan, they did thus evacuate Manassas. During the Peninsula campaign, as at no former period, northern Virginia was completely in our possession, and the vicinity of Washington free from the presence of the enemy. The ground so gained was not lost, nor Washington again put in danger, until the enemy learned of the orders for the evacuation of the Peninsula, sent to me at Harri son's bar, and were again left free to advance northward and menace the na tional capital. Perhaps no one now doubts that the best defence of Washington is a Peninsula attack on Richmond. My order for the organization of the army corps was issued on the 13th of March ; it has been given above. While at Fairfax Court House, on March 12, I was informed through the telegraph, by a member of my staff, that the following document had appeared in the National Intelligencer of that morning : [President's \"War Order, No. 3.] \"Executive Mansion, \" Washington, March 11, 1862. \" Major General McClellan having personally taken the field at the head of the army of the Potomac, until otherwise ordered, he is relieved from the com mand of the other military departments, he retaining command of the depart ment of the Potomac. \" Ordered, further, That the departments now under the respective commands of Generals Halleck and Hunter, together with so much of that under General Buell as lies west of a north and south line indefinitely drawn through Knox ville, Tennessee, be consolidated and designated the department of the Missis sippi; and that, until otherwise ordered, Major General Halleck have command of said department. \" Ordered, also, That the country west of the department of the Potomac and east of the department of the Mississippi be a military department, to be called the mountain department, and that the same be commanded by Major General Fremont. \" That all the commanders of departments, after the receipt of this order by them, respectively report severally and directly to the Secretary of War, and that prompt, full, and frequent reports will be expected of all and each of them. \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\" Though unaware of the President's intention to remove me from the position of general-in-chief, I cheerfully acceded to the disposition he saw fit to make of my services, and so informed him in a note on the 12th of March, in which occur these words : \" I believe I said to you some weeks since, in connexion with some western* matters, that no feeling of self-interest or ambition should ever prevent me from devoting myself to the service. I am glad'to have the opportunity to prove it, and you will find that, under present circumstances, I shall work just as cheer fully as before, and that no consideration of self will in any manner interfere with the discharge of my public duties. Again thanking you for the official and personal kindness you have so often evinced towards me, I am,\" &c, &c. On the 14th of March a reconnoissance of a large body of cavalry with some infantry, under command of General Stoneman, was sent along the Orange and Alexandria railroad to determine the position of the enemy, and, if possible, force his rear across the Rappahannock, but the roads were in such condition that, finding it impossible to subsist his men, General Stoneman was forced to return after reaching Cedar run."], [67, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 59 The following despatch from him recites the result of this expedition : \"Headquarters, Union Mills, \" March 16, 1862. \"We arrived here last evening about dark. We got corn for horses; no provisions for men. Bull run too high to cross. Had we stayed an hour longer we shordd not have got here to-day, owing to the high water in the streams.

Had we crossed, should not have been able to get back for high water. Had three men of 5th cavalry hit driving in enemy's pickets ; one slightly wounded in the head. Enemy acted confidently, and followed us some way back on the road, but did not molest us in any way. Enemy's force consisted of Stuart's and Ewell's cavalry, a battery of artillery, and some infantry. Railroad bridges all burned down up to Warrenton Junc tion ; still entire beyond, but all in readiness to burn at a moment's warning, having dry wood piled upon them. Heard cars running during night before last ; probably bringing up troops from Rappahannock. Heard of two regiments of infantry at Warrenton engaged in impressing the militia and securing forage. Heard of a large force of infantry this side of Rappahannock river, having come up to Warrenton Junction from Aquia creek day before yesterday. Bridges all destroyed this side of Broad run.

Before it was withdrawn a strong reconnoissance, under General Howard, was sent towards the Rappahannock, the result of which appears in the following despatch : \"Warrenton Junction, \" March 29, 1862. \" Express just received from General Howard. He drove the enemy across the Rappahannock bridge, and is now in camp on this bank of and near the Rappahannock river. \" The enemy blew up the bridge in his retreat.

General Howard will return to this camp to-morrow morning. \" E. V. SUMNER, Brigadier General. \" General S. Williams.\" The line of the Rappahannock and the Manassas Gap railroad was thus left reasonably secure from menace by any considerable body of the enemy. On the 13th of March a council of war was assembled at Fairfax Court House to discuss the military status. The President's order No. 3, of March 8th, was considered. The following is a memorandum of the proceedings of the council : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Fairfax Court House, March 13, 1862. \"A council of the generals commanding army corps, at the headquarters of the army of the Potomac, were of the opinion \u2014 \" I.

That the enemy's vessel, Merrimack, can be neutralized. \" 2d. That the means of transportation, sufficient for an immediate transfer of the force to its new base, can be ready at Washington and Alexandria to move down the Potomac ; and, \" 3d. That a naval auxiliary force can be had to silence, or aid in silencing, the enemy's batteries on the York river. \" 4th. That the force to be left to cover Washington shall be such as to givo an entire feeliug of security for its safety from menace. (Unanimous.) \" II. If the foregoing cannot be, the army should then be moved against the enemy, behind the Rappahannock, at the earliest possible moment, and the means for reconstructing bridges, repairing railroads, and stocking them with materials sufficient for supplying the army, should at once be collected, for both the Orange and Alexandria and Aquia and Richmond railroads. (Unanimous.) \" N.

The following reply was received the same day : \"War Department, March 13, 1862. \" The President having considered the plan of operations agreed upon by yourself and the commanders of army corps, makes no objection to the same, but gives the following directions as to its execution : \"1. Leave such force at Manassas Junction as shall make it entirely certain that the enemy shall not repossess himself of that position and line of commu nication. \"2. Leave Washington entirely secure. \" 3.

As soon as the Manassas Gap railway is in running order, intrench a brigade of infantry, say four regiments, with two batteries, at or near the point where the railway crosses the Shenandoah. Something like two regiments of cavalry should be left in that vicinity to occupy Winchester, and thoroughly scour the country south of the railway and up the Shenandoah valley, as well as through Chester gap, which might perhaps be advantageously occupied by a detachment of infantry, well intrenched.

WILLIAMS, \"Assistant Adjutant General. \"Brigadier General J. S. Wadsworth, \"Military Governor of the District of Columbia?' The Secretary of War had expressed a desire that I should communicate t(j the War Department my designs with regard to the employment of the army of the Potomac in an official form. I submitted, on the 19th of March, the following : \" Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Theological Seminary, Via., March 19, 1862. \"Sir : I have the honor to submit the following notes on the proposed opera tions of the active portion of the army of the Potomac. \" The proposed plan of campaign is to assume Fort Monroe as the first base of operations, taking the line of Yorktown and West Point upon Richmond as the line of operations, Richmond being the objective point. It is assumed that the fall of Richmond involves that of Norfolk and the whole of Virginia ; also, that we shall fight a decisive battle between West Point and Richmond, to give which battle the rebels will concentrate all their available forces, understanding, as they will, that it involves the fate of their cause. It therefore follows \u2014 \" 1st. That we should collect all our available forces and operate upon adja cent lines, maintaining perfect communication between our columns. \" 2d. That no time should be lost in reaching the field of battle. \" The advantages of the peninsula between York and James rivers are too ob vious to need explanation ; it is also clear that West Point should as soon as possible be reached, and used as our main depot, that we may have the shortest line of land transportation for our supplies, and the use of the York river. \" There are two methods of reaching this point \u2014 \" .1st. By moving directly from Fort Monroe as a base, and trusting to the roads for our supplies, at the same time landing a strong corps as near York town as possible, in order to turn the rebel lines of defence south of Yorktown ; then to reduce Yorktown and Gloucester by a siege, in all probability involving a delay of weeks, perhaps. \" 2d. To make a combined naval and land attack upon Yorktown, the first object of the campaign. This leads to the most rapid and decisive results. To accomplish this, the navy should at once concentrate upon the York river all"], [71, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 63 their available and most powerful batteries : its reduction should not in that case require many hours. A strong corps would be pushed up the York, under cover of the navy, directly upon West Point, immediately upon the fall of York town, and we could at once establish our new base of operations at a distance of some twenty-five miles from Richmond, with every facility for developing and bringing into play the whole of our available force on either or both banks of the James. ' \" It is impossible to urge too strongly the absolute necessity of the full co-op eration of the navy as a part of this programme. Without it the operations may be prolonged for many weeks, and we may be forced to carry in front sev eral strong positions which by their aid could be turned without serious loss of either time or men. \" It is also of first importance to bear in mind the fact already alluded to, that the capture of Richmond necessarily involves the prompt fall of Norfolk, while an operation against Norfolk, if successful, as the beginning of the cam paign, facilitates the reduction of Richmond merely by the demoralization of the rebel troops involved, and that after the fall of Norfolk we should be obliged to undertake the capture of Richmond by the same means which would have accomplished it in the beginning, having meanwhile afforded the rebels ample time to perfect their defensive arrangements, for they would well know, from the moment the army of the Potomac changed its base to Fort Monroe, that Richmond must be its ultimate object. \" It may be summed up in a few words, that, for the prompt success of this campaign, it is absolutely necessary that the navy should at once throw its whole available force, its most powerful vessels, against Yorktown. There is the most important point \u2014 there the knot to be cut. An immediate decision upon the sub ject-matter of this communication is highly desirable, and seems called for by the exigencies of the occasion. \" I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, \" GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, Major General. \" Hon. E. M. Stantox, Secretary of War.\" In the mean time the troops destined to form the active army were collected in camps convenient to the points of embarcation, and every preparation made to embark them as rapidly as possible when the transports were ready. A few days before sailing for Fort Monroe, while still encamped near Alexan dria, I met the President, by appointment, on a steamer. He there informed me that he had been strongly pressed to take General Blenker's division from my command and give it to General Fremont. His excellency was good enough to suggest several reasons for not taking Blenker's division from me. I assented to the force of his suggestions, and was extremely gratified by his decision to allow the division to remain with the army of the Potomac. It was therefore with surprise that I received, on the 31st, the following note : \" Executive Mansion, Washington, March 31, 1862. \" Mv Dear Sir : This morning I felt constrained to order Blenker's division to Fremont, and I write this to assure you that I did so with great pain, under standing that you would wish it otherwise. If you could know the full pres sure of the case, I am confident that you would justify it, even beyond a mere acknowledgment that the commander-in-chief may order what he pleases. \" Yours, very truly, . \"A. LINCOLN. \"Major General McClellan.\""], [72, "64 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. m'CLELLAN. To this I replied, in substance, that I regretted the order, and could ill afford to lose ten thousand troops which had been counted upon in forming my plan of campaign, but as there was no remedy, I would yield, and do the best I could without them. In a conversation with the President a few hours afterwards I repeated verbally the same thing, and expressed my regret that Blenker's di vision had been given to General Fremont from any pressure other than the re quirements of the national exigency. I was partially relieved, however, by the President's positive and emphatic assurance that I might be confident that no more troops beyond these ten thousand should in any event be taken from me, or in any way detached from my command. At the time of the evacuation of Manassas by the enemy, Jackson was at Winchester, our forces occupying Charlestown, and Shields's reaching Bunker Hill on the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, a brigade of General Banks's troops, under General Hamilton, entered Winchester, the enemy having left at 5 o'clock the evening before, his rear guard of cavalry leaving an hour before our advance entered the place. The enemy having made his preparations for evacuation some days before, it was not possible to intercept his retreat. On the 13th the mass of Banks's corps was concentrated in the immediate vicinity of Winches ter, the enemy being in the rear of Strasburg. On the 19th General Shields occupied Strasburg, driving the enemy twenty miles south to Mount Jackson. On the 20th the first division of Banks's corps commenced its movement to wards Manassas, in compliance with my letter of instructions of the 16th. Jackson probably received information of this movement, and supposed that no force of any consequence was left in the vicinity of Winchester, and upon the falling back of Shields to that place, for the purpose of enticing Jackson in pursuit, the latter promptly followed, whereupon ensued a skirmish on the 22d, in which General Shields was wounded, and an affair at Winchester on the 23d, resulting in the defeat of Jackson, who was pursued as rapidly as the ex haustion of our troops and the difficulty of obtaining supplies permitted. It is presumed that the full reports of the battle of Winchester were forwarded direct to the War Department by General Banks. It being now clear that the enemy had no intention of returning by the Manassas route, the following letter of April 1 was written to General Banks : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" On board the Commodore, April 1, 1862. \"General : The change in affairs in the valley of the Shenandoah has ren dered necessary a corresponding departure, temporarily at least, from the plan we some days since agreed upon. \"In my arrangements I assume that you have with you a force amply sufficient to drive Jackson before you, provided he is not re-enforced laro-ely. I also assume that you may find it impossible to detach anything towards Manas sas for some days, probably not until the operations of the main army have drawn all the rebel force towards Richmond. \"You are aware that General Sumner has for some days been at Manassas Junction with two divisions of infantry, six batteries, and two regiments of cav alry, and that a reconnoissance to the Rappahannock forced the enemy to destroy the railway bridge at Rappahannock Station, on the Orange and Alexandria railroad. Since that time our cavalry have found nothing on this side the Rap pahannock in that direction, and it seems clear that we have no reason to fear any return of the rebels in that quarter. Their movements near Fredericksburg also indicate a final abandonment of that neighborhood. I doubt whether John son will now re-enforce Jackson with a view of offensive operations. The time is probably passed when he could have gained anything by doing so. I have ordered in one of Sumner's divisions (that of Richardson, late Simmer's) to"], [73, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. m'cLELLAN. 65 Alexandria for embarcation. Blenker's has been detached from the army of the Potomac and ordered to report to General Fremont. \"Abercrombie is probably at Warrenton Junction to-day. Geary is at White Plains. \" Two regiments of cavalry have been ordered out, and are now on the way to relieve the two regiments of Sumner. \" Four thousand infantry and one battery leave Washington at once for Ma nassas. Some three thousand more will move in one or two days, and soon after some three thousand additional. \"I will order Blenker to march on Strasburg and to report to you for tem porary duty, so that should you find a large force in your front you can avail yourself of his aid as soon as possible. Please direct him to Winchester, thence to report to the Adjutant General of the army for orders ; but keep him until you are sure what you have^n front. \" In regard to your own movements, the most important thing at present is to throw Jackson well back, and then to assume such a position as to enable you to prevent his return. As soon as the railway communications are re-established it will be probably important and advisable to move on Staunton, but this would require secure communications, and* a force of from twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand for active operations. It should also be nearly coincident with my own move on Richmond, at all events not so long before it as to enable the rebels to concentrate on you, and then return on me. I fear that you cannot be ready in time, although it may come in very well with a force less than that I have mentioned, after the main battle near Richmond. When General Sumner leaves Warrenton Junction, General Abercrombie will be placed in immediate command of Manassas and Warrenton Junction, under your general orders Please inform me frequently by telegraph and otherwise as to the state of things in your front. \"lam very truly yours, \"GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General Commanding. Major General N. P. Banks, Commanding Fifth Corps. \" P. S. \u2014 From what I have just learned, it would seem that the regiments of cavalry intended for Warrenton Junction have gone to Harper's Ferry. Of the four additional regiments placed under your orders, two should as promptly as possible move by the shortest route on Warrenton Junction. \"I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, \" GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding.\" This letter needs no further explanation than to say that it was my intention, had the operations in that quarter remained under my charge, either to have resumed the defensive position marked out in the letter of March 16, or to have advanced General Banks upon Staunton as might in the progress of events seem advisable. It is to be remembered that when I wrote the preceding and following letters of April 1 I had no expectation of being relieved from the charge of the opera tions in the Shenandoah valley, the President's war order No. 3 giving no inti mation of such an intention, and that so far as reference was made to final op erations after driving Jackson back and taking such a position as to prevent his return, no positive, orders were given in the letter, the matter being left for future consideration, when the proper time arrived for a decision. From the following letter to the Adjutant General, dated April 1, 1862, it will be seen that I left for the defence of the national capital and its approaches, when I sailed for the Peninsula, 73,456 men, with 109 pieces of light artillery, H. Ex. Doc. 15 5"], [74, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. ll'CLELLAN. 66 including the 32 pieces in Washington alluded to, but not enumerated in my letter to the Adjutant General. It will also be seen that I recommended other available troops in New York (more than 4,000) to be at once ordered forward to re-enforce them. \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \"Steamer Commodore, April 1, 1862. \"General: I have to request that you will lay the following communication before the Hon.

I learn from Governor Curtin that there are some 3,500 men now ready in Pennsylvania. This force 1 should be glad to have sent to Manas sas. Four thousand men from General Wadsworth I desire to be ordered to Manassas. These troops, with the railroad guards above alluded to, will make up a force under the command of General Abercrombie of something like 18,639 men. \" It is my design to push General Blenker's division from Warrenton upon Strasburg. He should remain at Strasburg long enough to allow matters to assume a definite form in that region before proceeding to his ultimate destination. \" The troops in the valley of the Shenandoah will thus \u2014 including Blenker's division, 10,028 strong, with 24 pieces of artillery; Banks's 5th corps, which embraces the command of General Shields, 19,687 strong, with 41 guns, some 3,652 disposable cavalry, and the railroad guards, about 2,100 men \u2014 amount to about 35,467 men. \"It is designed to relieve General Hooker by one regiment, say 850 men, being, with some 500 cavalry, 1,350 men on the lower Potomac. \" To recapitulate : At Warrenton there is to be 7,780 men \" At Manassas, say ' 10,859 \" \" In the valley of the Shenandoah 35,467 \" \" On the lower Potomac 1,350 \" \"In all 55,456 \" \" There would thus be left for the garrisons and the front of Washington, under General Wadsworth, some 18,000, inclusive of the batteries under instruc tion.

M'CLELLAN. 68 Without including General Blenker's division, there were left 67,428 men and 85 pieces of light artillery, which, under existing circumstances, I deemed more than adequate to insure the perfect security of Washington against any force the enemy could bring against it, for the following reasons : The light troops I had thrown forward under General Stoneman in pursuit of the rebel army, after the evacuation of Manassas and Centreville, had driven their rear guard across Cedar run, and subsequent expeditions from Sumner's corps had forced them beyond the Rappahannock. They had destroyed all the railroad bridges behind them, thereby indicating that they did not intend to return over that route. Indeed, if they had attempted such a movement, their progress must have been slow and difficult, as it would have involved the re construction of the bridges ; and if my orders for keeping numerous cavalry patrols well out to the front, to give timely notice of any approach of the enemy, had been strictly enforced, (and I left seven regiments of cavalry for this ex press purpose,) they could not by any possibility have reached Washington before there would have been ample time to concentrate the entire forces left for its defence, as well as those at Baltimore, at any necessary point. It was clear to my mind, as I reiterated to the authorities, that the movement of the army of the Potomac would have the effect to draw off the hostile army from Manassas to the defence of their capital, and thus free Washington from menace. This opinion was confirmed the moment the movement commenced, or rather as soon as the enemy became aware of our intentions; for with the ex ception .of Jackson's force of some 15,000, which his instructions show to have been intended to operate in such a way as to prevent McDowell's corps from being sent to re-enforce me, no rebel force of any magnitude made its appearance in front of Washington'during the progress of our operations on the Peninsula; nor until the order was given for my return from Harrison's landing was Wash ington again threatened. Surrounded, as Washington was, with numerous and strong fortifications, well garrisoned, it was manifest that the enemy could not afford to detach from his main army a force sufficient to assail them. It is proper to remark, that just previous to my departure for Fort Monroe, I sent my chief of staff to General Hitchcock, who at that time held staff re lations with his excellency the President and the Secretary of War, to sub mit to him a list of the troops I proposed to leave for the defence of Washing ton, and the positions in which I designed posting them. General Hitchcock, after glancing his eye over the list, observed that he was not the judge of what was required for defending the capital ; that General McClellan's was such as to enable him to understand the subject much better than he did, and he presumed that if the force designated was, in his judgment, sufficient, nothing more would be required. He was then told by the chief of staff that I would be glad to have his opinion, as an old and experienced officer ; to this he replied, that as I had had the entire control of the defences for a long time, I was the best judge of what was needed, and he declined to give any other expression of opinion at that time. On the 2d of April, the day following my departure for Fort Monroe, Gen erals Hitchcock and Thomas were directed by the Secretary of War to ex amine and report whether the President's instructions to me, of March 8 and 13, had been complied with; on the same day their report was submitted, and their decision was \u2014 \" That the requirement of the President, that this city (Washington) shall be left entirely secure, has not been fully complied with.\" The President, in his letter to me on the 9th of April, says : \" And now allow me to ask, do you really think I should permit the line from Richmond, via Manassas Junction, to this city, to be entirely open, except what resistance could be presented by less than twenty thousand unorganized troops.\""], [77, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 69 In the report of Generals Hitchcock and Thomas, alluded to, it is acknowl edged that there was no danger of an attack from the direction of Manassas, in these words : \" In regard to occupying Manassas Junction, as the enemy have destroyed the railroads leading to it, it may be fair to assume that they have no intention of returning for the reoccupation of their late position, and therefore no large force would be necessary to hold that position.\" That, as remarked before, was precisely the view I took of it, and this was enforced by the subsequent movements of the enemy. In another paragraph of the report it is stated that fifty-five thousand men was the number considered adequate for the defence of the capital. That Gen eral McClellan, in his enumeration of the forces left, had included Banks's army corps, operating in the Shenandoah valley, but whether this corps should be regarded as available for the protection of Washington they decline to express an opinion. At the time this report was made, the only enemy on any approach to Wash ington was Jackson's force, in front of Banks in the Shenandoah valley, with the Manassas Gap railroad leading from this valley to Washington ; and it will be admitted, I presume, that Banks, occupying the Shenandoah valley, was in the best position to defend not only that approach to Washington, but the roads to Harper's Ferry and above. The number of troops left by me for the defence of Washington, as given in my letter to the Adjutant General, were taken from the latest official returns of that date, and these, of course, constituted the most trustworthy and authentic source from which such iaformation could be obtained. Another statement made by General Hitchcock before the \" Committee on the Conduct of the War,\" in reference to this same o*der, should be noticed. He was asked the following question : \" Do you understand now that the movement made by General McClellan to Fort Monroe, and up the York river, was in compliance with the recommendation of the council of generals com manding corps, and held at Fairfax Court House on the 13th of March last, or in violation of it ? \" To which he replied as follows : \" I have considered, and do now consider, that it was in violation of the recommendation of that council iu two important particulars ; one particular being that portion of this report which represents the council as agreeing to the expedition by way of the Peninsula, provided the rebel steamer Merrimack could first be neutralized. That important provis- on General McClellan disregarded.\" The second particular alluded to by General Hitchcock was in reference to the troops left for the defence of Washington, which has been disposed of above. In regard to the steamer Merrimack, I have also stated that, so far as our opera tions on York river were concerned, the power of this vessel was neutralized. I now proceed to give some of the evidence which influenced me in coming to that conclusion. Previous to our departure for the Peninsula, Mr. Watson, Assistant Secretary of War, was sent by the President to Fort Monroe to consult with Flag-officer Goldsborough upon this subject. The result of that consultation is contained in the following extract from the evidence of Admiral Goldsborough before the \" Committee on the Conduct of the War,\" viz: \"I told Mr. Watson, Assistant Secretary of War, that the President might make his mind perfectly easy about the Merrimack going up York river; that she could never get there, for I had ample means to prevent that.\" Captain G. V. Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, testifies before the committee as follows : \"General McClellan expected the navy to neutralize the Merrimack, and I promised that it should be done.\""], [78, "70 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. General Keyes, commanding 4th army corps, testifies as follows before the committee : \"During the time that the subject of the change of base was discussed, I had refused to consent to the Peninsula line of operations until I had sent word to the Navy Department and asked two questions : First, whether the Merrimack was certainly neutralized, or not? Second, whether the navy was in a condition to co-operate efficiently with the army to break through between Yorktown and Gloucester point ? To both of these, answers were returned in the affirmative ; that is, the Merrimack was neutralized, and the navy was in a condition to co operate efficiently to break through between Yorktown and Gloucester point.\" Before starting for the Peninsula, I instructed Lieutenant Colonel B. S. Alexander, of the United States corps of engineers, to visit Manassas Junction and its vicinity for the purpose of determining upon the defensive works neces sary to enable us to hold that place with a small force. The accompanying letters from Colonel Alexander will show what steps were taken by him to carry into effect this important order. I regret to say that those who succeeded me in command of the region in front of Washington, whatever were the fears for its safety did not deem it neces sary to carry out my plans and instructions to them. Had Manassas been placed in condition for a strong defence, and its communications secured as recom mended by Colonel Alexander, the result of General Pope's campaign would probably have been different. \"Washington, D. C, April 2, 1862. \" Sir : You will proceed to Manassas at as early a moment as practicable and mark on the ground the works for the defence of that place, on the positions which I indicated to you yesterday. You will find two carpenters, experienced in this kind of work, ready to accompany you, by calling on Mr. Dougherty, the master carpenter of the Treasury extension. \" The general idea of the defence of this position is, to occupy the fringe of elevation which lies about half way between Manassas depot and the junction of the railroad, with a series of works open to the rear, so that they may be commanded by the work hereafter to be described. \" There will be at least four of these works, three of them being on the left of the railroad leading from Alexandria, at the positions occupied by the enemy's works. The other on the right of this road, on the position we examined yesterday. The works of the enemy to the north of this latter position, numbered 1 and 2 on Lieutenant Comstock's sketch, may also form a part of the front line of our defence; but the sides of these works looking towards Manassas station should be levelled, so that the interior of the works may be seen from the latter position. \" Embrasures should be arranged in all these works for field artillery. The approaches should be such that a battery can drive into the works. The number of embrasures in each battery will depend upon its size and the ground to be commanded. It is supposed there will be from four to eight embra sures in each battery. \"The other works of the enemy looking towards the east and south may be stengthened so as to afford sufficient defence in these directions. The work No. 3 in Lieutenant Comstock's sketch may be also strengthened and arranged for field artillery, when time will permit. This work is in a good position to cover a retreat, which would be made down the valley in which the railroad runs towards Bull run. \" At Manassas station there should be a fort constructed. The railroad will pass through this fort, and the depot, if there should be one built, should be placed iu its rear. This latter work should be regarded as the key to the posi tion. It should be as large as the nature of the ground will permit."], [79, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. m'cLELLAN. 71 \"By going down the slopes, which are not steep, it may be made large enough to accommodate 2,000 or 3,000 men. The top of the position need not be cut away ; it will be better to throw up the earth into a large traverse, which may also be a bomb-proof. Its profile should be strong, and its ditches should be flanked. It should receive a heavy armament of 24 or 32 pounders, with some rifled (Parrott) 20 or 30 pounders. Its guns should command all the exterior works, so that these works could be of no use to the enemy, should he take them. In accommodating the fort to the ground this consideration should not be lost sight of. \" After tracing these works on the ground, you will make a sketch embracing the whole of them, showing their relative positions and size. This sketch should embrace the junction of the railroads and the ground for some distance around the main work. It need not be made with extreme accuracy. The distances may be paced, or measured, with a tape line. The bearings may be taken by compass. \" Having located the works and prepared your sketch, you will report to Captain Frederick E. Prime, of the corps of engineers, who will furnish you the means of construction. \" It is important that these works should be built with the least possible delay. You will, therefore, expedite matters as fast as possible. \" Very respectfully, your obedient servant, \"B. S. ALEXANDER, \"Lieutenant Colonel, Aide-de-Camp. \"Captain Fred. R. Munther, Present.\" \"Washington, April 6, 1862. \" Sir : I enclose you herewith a copy of the instructions which I gave to Captain Munther, in reference to the defences of Manassas. \" As there has been a new department created, (that of the Rappahannock,) it is possible that you and I, as well as General McClellan, are relieved from the further consideration of this subject at the present time. \" I will, however, state for your information, should the subject ever come before you again, that in my opinion the communication with Manassas by land should be secured. \" To effect this in the best manner, so far as my observations extended, I think the bridge over Bull run, near Union mills and just above the railroad bridge, should be rebuilt or thoroughly repaired, and that a small work, or two or three open batteries, should be erected on the adjacent heights to protect it as well as the railroad bridge. \" The communication by land would then be through or near Centreville, over the road used by the enemy. \" I write this for fear something should detain me here ; but I hope to leave here to join you to-morrow. My health is much improved. \" Very respectfully, your obedient servant, \" B. S. ALEXANDER, \"Lieutenant Colonel, Aide-de-Camp. \"Brigadier General J. G. Barnard, \" Chits Engineer, Army of the. Potomac.\" I may be permitted also to mention that the plans (also unexecuted by my successi ir) indicated in my letter of instructions to General Banks, dated March 16, 1862, for intrenching Chester gap and the point where the Manassas rail road crosses the Shenandoah, were for the purpose of preventing even the at tempt of such a raid as that of Jackson in the month of May following."], [80, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 72 military incidents of the first period. Before taking up the history of the embarcation and Peninsula campaign, I should remark that during the fall and winter of 1861-'62, while the army of the Potomac was in position in front of Washington, reconnoissances were made from time to time, and skirmishes frequently occurred, which were of great im portance in the education of the troops, accustoming them to the presence of the enemy, and giving them confidence under fire. There were many instances of individual gallantry displayed in these affairs ; the reports of them will he found among the documents which accompany this report. One of the most brilliant of these affairs was that which took place at Drains ville on December 20, 1861, when the 3d brigade of McCall's division, under Brigadier General E. 0. C. Ord, with Easton's battery, routed and pursued four regiments of infantry, one of cavalry, and a battery of six pieces. The operations of Brigadier General F. W. Lander on the upper Potomac, during the months of January and February, 1862, frustrated the attempts of General Jackson against the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, Cumberland, &c, and obliged him to fall back to Winchester. His constitution was impaired by the hardships he had experienced, and on the 2d March the fearless General Lander expired, a victim to the excessive fatigue of the campaign. SECOND PERIOD. CHAPTER I. The council composed of the four corps commanders, organized by the President of the United States, at its meetingon the 13th of March, adopted Fort Monroe as the base of operations for the movement of the army of the Potomac upon Richmond. For the prompt and successful execution of the projected operation, it was regarded by all as necessary that the whole of the four corps should be employed, with at least the addition of ten thousand men drawn from the forces in the vicinity of Fortress Monroe, that position and its dependencies being regarded as amply protected by the naval force in its neighborhood, and the advance of the main army up the Peninsula, so that it could be safely left with a small garrison. In addition to the land forces, the co-operation of the navy was desired in the projected attack upon the batteries at Yorktown and Gloucester, as \u2022well as in controlling the York and James rivers for the protection of our flanks, and the use of the transports bringing supplies to the army. With these expectations, and for reasons stated elsewhere in this report, my ori ginal plan of moving by Urbana and West Point was abandoned, and the line with Fort Monroe as a base adopted. In the arrangements for the transportation of the army to the Peninsula by water, the vessels were ori ginally ordered to rendezvous mainly at Annapolis ; but upon the evacuation of Manassas and, the batteries of the lower Potomac by the enemy, it became more convenient to embark the troops and material at Alexandria, and orders to that effect were at once given. In making the preliminary arrangements for the movement it was de termined that the first corps, General McDowell's, should move as a unit first, and effect a landing either at the Sand-box, some four miles south of Yorktown, in order to turn all the enemy's defences at Ship point, Howard's bridge, Big Bethel, &c, or else, should existing circumstances render it pre ferable, land on the Gloucester side of York river and move on West Point."], [81, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 73 The transports, however, arrived slowly and few at a time. In order, therefore, to expedite matters, I decided to embark the army by divisions, as transports arrived, keeping army corps together as much as possible, and to collect the troops at Fort Monroe. In determining the order of embarca tion, convenience and expedition were especially consulted, except that the first corps, was to be embarked last, as I intended to move it in mass to its point of disembarcation, and. to land it on either bank of the York, as might then be determined. ' On the 11th of March Hamilton's division, of the 3d corps, embarked at Alexandria and proceeded to Fort Monroe, with the following orders : \"Washington, D. C, March 17, 1862. \" You will, on your arrival at Fort Monroe, report to General Wool and request him to assign you ground for encamping your division. You will remain at Fort Monroe until further orders from General McClellan. Should General Wool require the services of your division in repelling an attack, you will obey his orders and use every effort to carry out his views. \"R. B. MARCY, \" Chief of Staff . \" General 0. S. Hamilton, \" Commanding Division.\" On the 22d of March, as soon as transportation was ready, General Fitz- John Porter's division, of the same corps, embarked. General Heintzelman was ordered to accompany it, under the following instructions : \" Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \"Seminary, March 22, 1862. \" General : Upon the disembarcation of Porter's division at Fort Monroe, I have to request that you will move your two divisions, Porter's and Ham- ilton's, some three or four miles out from the fort to find good camping places, where wood and water can be readily obtained, and wherte your positions will be good in a defensive point of view. You may find it advisable to place one division on or near the road leading to Yorktown from Newport News \u2014 the other upon that leading to Yorktown direct from Fort Monroe. If you find that the nature of the country will permit easy communication and mutual support between the two divisions, it will be best to place one on each road. It will be best to remain pretty near the fort for the present, in order to give the impression that our object is to attack Norfolk rather than Yorktown. You will do well, however, to push strong reconnoissances well to the front to ascertain the position of the enemy and his pickets. I will, as soon as possible, re-enforce you by the 3d division of your corps, and it is probable that a part or the whole of the 4th corps will also move from Fort Monroe. This will probably be determined before your disembarcation is completed, and you will be informed accordingly. \" My desire would be' to make no important move in advance until we are fully prepared to follow it up and give the enemy no time to recover. \"The quartermaster of your corps will receive detailed instructions in regard to land transportation from General Van Vliet. \" It will be advisable to mobilize your corps with the least possible delay, and have it prepared for an advance. I have directed extra clothing, ammunition, &c, to be sent to Fort Monroe, so that all deficiencies may be supplied without delay. \" Please report to me frequently and fully the condition of things on the new field of operations, and whatever intelligence you gain as to the enemy."], [82, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 74 \" Engage guides in sufficient numbers at once, and endeavor to send out spies. \" I am very truly yours, \" GEO. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding. \" Brigadier General S. P. Heintzelmax, \" Commanding 3d Corps.\" \u25a0 The remaining divisions embarked as rapidly as transports could be sup plied. * On the 1st of April I embarked with the headquarters on the steamer Commodore, and reached Fort Monroe on the afternoon of the 2d. In consequence of the delay in the arrival of the horse transports at Alexandria, but a small portion of the cavalry had arrived, and the artillery reserve had not yet completed its disembarcation. I found there the 3d Pennsylvania cavalry and the 5th regular cavalry; the 2d regular cavalry and a portion of the 1st had arrived, but not dis embarked. So few wagons had arrived that it was not possible to move Casey's division at all for several days, while the other divisions were obliged to move with scant supplies. As to the force and position of the enemy the information then in our possession was vague and untrustworthy. Much of it was obtained from the staff officers of General Wool, and was simply to the effect that York town was surrounded by a continuous line of earthworks, with strong water batteries on the York river, and garrisoned by not less than 15,000 troops, under command of General J. B. Magruder. Maps, which had been pre pared by the topographical engineers under General Wool's command, were furnished me, in which the Warwick river was represented as flowing par allel to, but not crossing, the road from Newport News to Williamsburg, making the so-called Mulberry island a real island ; and we had no infor mation as to the true course of the Warwick across the Peninsula, nor of the formidable line of works which it covered. Information which I had \u25a0 collected during the winter placed General Magruder's command at from 15,000 to 20,000 men, independently of Gen eral Huger's force at Norfolk, estimated at about 15,000. It was also known that there Were strong defensive works at or near Williamsburg. Knowing that General Huger could easily spare some troops to re-enforce Yorktown, that he had indeed done so, and that Johnston's army of Ma nassas could be brought rapidly by the James and York rivers to the same point, I proposed to invest that town without delay. The accompanying map of Colonel Cram, U. S. topographical engineers, attached to General Wool's staff, given to me as the result of several months' labor, indicated the feasibility of the design. It was also an object of primary importance to reach the vicinity of Yorktown before the enemy was re-enforced sufficiently to enable him to hold in force his works at Big Bethel, Howard's bridge, Ship point, &c, on the direct road to Yorktown and Young's mills, on the road from Newport News. This was the more urgent, as it was now evident that some days must elapse before the first corps could arrive. Everything possible was done to hasten the disembarcation of the cavalry, artillery and wagons in the harbor ; and on the 3d the orders of march were given for the following day. There were at Fort Monroe and in its vicinity on the 3d, ready to move, two divisions of the 3d corps, two divisions of the 4th corps, and one division of the 2d corps, and Sykes's brigade of regular infantry, together"], [83, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 75 with Hunt's artillery reserve and the regiments of cavalry before named, in all about 58,000 men and 100 guns, besides the division of artillery. Richardson's and Hooker's divisions of the 2d and 3d corps bad not ar rived, and Casey's division of the 4th corps was unable to move for want of wagons. Before I left Washington an order had been issued by the War Depart ment placing Fort Monroe and its dependencies under my control, and au thorizing me to draw from the troops under General Wool a division of about 10,000 men, which was to be assigned to the 1st corps. During the night of the 3d I received a telegram from the Adjutant General of the army, stating that, by the President's order, I was deprived of all control over General Wool and the troops under his command, and for bidden to detach any of his troops without his sanction. This order left me without any base of operations under my own control, and to this day I am ignorant of the causes which led to it. On my arrival at Fort Monroe the James river was declared by the naval authorities closed to the operations of their vessels by the combined in fluence of the enemy's batteries on its banks and the confederate steamers Merrimack, Yorktown, Jamestown, and Teazer. Flag-Officer Goldsborough, then in command of the United States squadron in Hampton roads, regarded it (and no doubt justly) as his highest and most imperative duty to watch and neutralize the Merrimack ; and as he designed using his most powerful vessels in a contest with her, he did not feel able to detach to the assistance of the army a suitable force to attack the water batteries at Yorktown and Gloucester. All this was contrary to what had been previously stated to me, and materially affected my plans. At no time during the operations against Yorktown was the navy pre pared to lend us any material assistance in its reduction until after our land batteries had partially silenced the works. I had hoped, let me say, by rapid movements, to drive before me or capture the enemy on the Peninsula, open the James river, and press on to Richmond before he should be materially re-enforced from other portions of the territory. As the narrative proceeds the causes will be developed which frustrated these apparently well-grounded expectations. I determined then to move the two divisions of the 4th corps by the New port News and Williamsburg road, to take up a position between Yorktown and Williamsburg, while the two divisions of the 3d corps moved direct from Fort Monroe upon Yorktown ; the reserves moving so as to support either corps as might prove necessary. I designed, should the works at Yorktown and Williamsburg offer a serious resistance, to land the 1st corps, re-enforced if necessary, on the left bank of the York or on the Severn, to move it on Gloucester and West Point, in order to take in reverse what ever force the enemy might have on the Peninsula, and compel him to abandon his positions. In the commencement of the movement from Fort Monroe, serious diffi culties were encountered from the want of -precise topographical information as to the country in advance. Correct local maps were not to be found, and the country, though known in its general feature, we found to be inaccu rately described in essential particulars in the only maps aud geographical memoirs or papers to which access could be had. Erroneous courses to streams and roads were frequently given, and no dependence could be placed on the information thus derived. This difficulty has been found to exist with respect to most portions of the State of Virginia, through which my military operations have extended. Reconnoissances, frequently under fire proved the only trustworthy sources of information. Negroes, however"], [84, "76 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. truthful their reports, possessed or were able to communicate very little accurate and no comprehensive topographical information. On the 3d the following orders were given for the movement of the 4th : \"Porter's and Hamilton's divisions and Averill's cavalry of the 3d corps, and Sedgwick's division of the 2d corps, under Brigadier General Heintzel man, commanding 3d corps, will move to-morrow in the following order: Porter's division with Averill's cavalry at 6 a. m., over the Newmarket and New .bridges to Big Bethel and Howard's bridge. This division will send forward to the batteries where the Ship Point road intersects the main York town road a sufficient force to hold that point, and cut off the garrison of the Ship Point batteries. The whole division may be used for this purpose if necessary, and if possible the batteries should be occupied by our troops to-morrow. The portion of the division not necessary for this purpose will encamp at Howard's bridge. \"Hamilton's division will march at 1 a. m. by the New bridge road to Big Bethel, and will encamp on Howard's creek. \" Sedgwick's division will march at 8 a. m. by the Newmarket bridge, taking the direct road to Big Bethel, and will also encamp at Howard's bridge. \"Brigadier General Keyes, commanding 4th corps, will move with Smith's and Couch's divisions at 6 a. m., (Smith's division in advance,) by the James river road. The 5th regular cavalry, temporarily assigned to this corps, will move with Smith's division, which will encamp at Young's mills, throw ing forward at least one brigade to the road from Big Bethel to Warwick. Couch's division will encamp at Fisher's creek. \"The reserve cavalry, artillery and infantry will move at 8.30 a. m., by the Newmarket bridge, to Big Bethel, where it will encamp. On the march it wall keep in rear of Sedgwick's division.\" The following is an extract from the order issued on the 4th for the march of the 5th: \" The following movements of the army will be carried out to-morrow (5th:) \" General Keyes will move forward Smith's division at 6 a. m., via War wick Court House and the road leading near the old ship yard, to the 'Half way House' on the Yorktown and Williamsburg road. \" General Couch's division will march at 6 a. m., to close up on General Smith's division at the ' Halfway House.' _ \" General Keyes's command will occupy and hold the narrow dividing ridge near the ' Halfway House,' so as to prevent the escape of the garri son at Yorktown by land, and prevent re-enforcements being thrown in. \" General Heintzelman will move forward General Porter's two rear brigades at 6 a. m., upon the advanced guard, when the entire division will advance to a point about two and three-quarters miles from Yorktown, where the road turns abruptly to the north, and where a road comes in from Warwick Court House. \"General Hamilton's division will move at 6 a. m., and follow General Porter's division, camping as near it as possible. \" General Sedgwick's division will march at 5 a. m., as far as the Warwick road, which enters the main Yorktown road near Doctor Powers's house, and will await further orders. \"The reserve will march at 6 a. m.,upon the main Yorktown road, halting for further orders at Doctor Powers's house; the infantry leading, the artillery following next, and the cavalry in rear. \" General Sedgwick's division will, for the present, act with the reserve and he will receive orders from headquarters.\""], [85, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 77 In giving these orders of march for the 4th and 5th, it was expected that there would be no serious opposition at Big Bethel, and that the advance of the 3d corps-beyond that point would force^ the enemy to evacuate the works at Young's mills, while our possession of the latter would make it necessary for him to abandon those at Howard's bridge, and the advance thence on Yorktown would place Sbip point in our possession, together with its garrison, unless they abandoned it promptly. The result answered the expectation. During the afternoon of the 4th, General Keyes obtained information of the presence of some 5,000 to 8,000 of the enemy in a strong position at Lee's mills. The nature of that position in relation to the Warwick not being at that time understood, I instructed General Keyes to attack and carry this position upon coming in front of it. Early in the afternoon of the 5th the advance of each column was brought to a haft, that of Heintzelman (Porter's division) in front of Yorktown, after overcoming some resistance at Big Bethel and Howard's bridge; that of Keyes (Smith's division) unexpectedly before the enemy's works at Lee's mills, where the road from Newport News to Williamsburg crosses War wick river. The progress of each column had been retarded by heavy rains on that day, which had made the roads almost impassable to the infantry of Keyes's column, and impassable to all but a small portion of the artillery, while the ammunition, provisions and forage could not be brought up at all. When General Keyes approached Lee's mills his left flank was exposed to a sharp artillery fire from the further bank of the Warwick, and upon reach ing the vicinity of the mill he found it altogether stronger than was ex pected, unapproachable by reason of the Warwick river, and incapable of being carried by assault. The troops composing the advance of each column were, during the afternoon, tinder a warm artillery fire, the sharpshooters even of the right column being engaged when covering reconnoissances. It was at this stage and moment of the campaign that the following tele gram was sent tome: \" Adjutant General's Office, \" April 4, 1862. \" By direction of the President, General McDowell's army corps has been detached from the force under your immediate command, and the general is ordered to report to the Secretary of War. Letter by mail. \"L. THOMAS, \"Adjutant General. \" General McClellan.\" The President having promised, in an interview following his order of March 31, withdrawing Blenker's division of 10,000 men from my command, that nothing of the sort should be repeated \u2014 that I might rest assured that the campaign should proceed, with no further deductions from the force upon which its operations had been planned \u2014 I may confess to having been shocked at this order, which, with that of the 31st ultimo and that of the 3d, removed nearly 60,000 men from my command, and reduced my force by more than one-third, after its task had been assigned; its operations planned; its fighting begun. To me the blow was most discouraging. It frustrated all my plans for impending operations. It fell when I was too deeply com mitted to withdraw. It left me incapable of continuing operations which had been begun. It compelled the adoption of another, a different and a less effective plan of campaign. It made rapid and brilliant operations im possible. It was a fatal error."], [86, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 78 It was now, of course, *out of my power to turn Yorktown by West Point. I had, therefore, no choice left* but to attack it directly in front, as I best could with the force at my command. Reconnoissances made under fire on that and the following day deter mined that the sources of the Warwick river were near Yorktown, com manded by its guns, while that stream, for some distance from its mouth on the James river, was controlled by the confederate gunboats; that the fords had been destroyed by dams, the approaches to which were generally through dense forests and deep swamps, and defended by extensive and formidable works; that timber felled for defensive purposes and the flooding of the roads, caused by the dams, had made these works apparently inaccessible and im possible to turn; that Yorktown was strongly fortified, armed and garri soned, and connected with the defences of the Warwick by forts and in trenchments, the ground in front of which was swept by the guns of York town. It was also ascertained that the garrisons had been, and were daily being re enforced by troops from Norfolk and the army under General J. E. Johnston. Heavy rains made the roads to Fort Monroe impassable, and delayed the arrival of troops, ammunition and supplies, while storms pre vented for several days the sailing of transports from Hampton roads, and the establishment of depots on the creeks of York river, near the army. The ground bordering the Warwick river is covered by very dense and extensive forests, the clearings being small and few. This, with the com parative flatness of the country, and the alertness of the enemy, everywhere in force, rendered thorough reconnoissances slow, dangerous and difficult, yet it was impossible otherwise to determine whether an assault was any where practicable, or whether the more tedious but sure operations of a siege must be resorted to. I made, on the 6th and 7th, close personal reconnoissances of the right and left of the enemy's positions, which, with information acquired already, convinced me that it was best to prepare for an assault by the preliminary employment- of heavy guns, and some siege operations. Instant assault would have been simple folly. On the 7th I telegraphed to the President as follows: \" Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \"April 7, 1862. \" Your telegram of yesterday is received. In reply, I have the honor to state that my entire force for duty amounts to only about (85,000) eighty five thousand men. General Wool's command, as you will observe from the accompanying order, has been taken out of my control, although he has most cheerfully co-operated with me. The only use that can be made of his com mand is to protect my communications in rear of this point. At this time only fifty-three thousand men have joined me, but they are coming up as rapidly as my means of transportation will permit. \" Please refer to my despatch to the Secretary of War to-night, for the details of our present situation. \" GEO. B. McOLELLAN, \" Major GeneraL \" To the President, Washington, D. C.\" On the same day I sent the following: \" Headquarters Army of the Potomac \" In front of Yorktown, \" April 7, 1862\u20147 p. m. \"Your telegram of yesterday arrived here while I was absent, examining the enemy's right, which I did pretty closely."], [87, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 79 \" The whole line of the Warwick, which really heads within a mile of Yorktown, is strongly defended by detached redoubts and other fortifica tions, armed with heavy and light guns. The approaches, except at York town, are covered by the Warwick, over which there is but one, or, at most, two passages, both of which are covered by strong batteries. It will be necessary to resort to the use of heavy guns, and some siege operations, before we assault. All the prisoners state that General J. E. Johnston arrived at Yorktown yesterday with strong re-enforcements. It seems clear that I shall have the whole force of the enemy on my hands \u2014 probably not less than (100,000) one hundred thousand men, and probably more. In con sequence of the loss of Blenker's division and the 1st corps, my force is pos sibly less than that of the enemy, while they have all the advantage of position. \" I am under great obligations to you for the offer that the whole force and material of the government will be as fully and as speedily under my command as heretofore, or as if the new departments had not been created. \"Since my arrangements were made fur this campaign, at least (50,000) fifty thousand men have been taken from my command. Since my despatch of the 5th inst., five divisions have been in close observation of the enemy, and frequently exchanging shots. When my present command all joins, I shall have about (85,000) eighty-five thousand men for duty, from which a large force must be taken for guards, scouts, &c. With this army 1 could assault the enemy's works, and perhaps carry them; but were I in pos session of their intrenchments, and assailed by double my numbers, I should have no fears as to the result. \" Under the circumstances that have been developed since we arrived here, I feel fully impressed with the conviction that here is to be fought the great battle that is to decide the existing contest. I shall, of course, com mence the attack as soon as I can get up my siege train, and shall do all in my power to carry the enemy's works, but to do this with a reasonable de gree of certainty requires, in my judgment, that I should, if possible, have at least the whole of the 1st corps to land upon the Severn river and attack Gloucester in the rear. \"My present strength will not admit of a detachment sufficient for this purpose, without materially impairing the efficiency of this column. Flag- Officer Goldsborough thinks the works too strong for his available vessels, unless I can turn Gloucester. I send, by mail, copies of his letter and one of the commander of the gunboats here. \" GEO. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General. \" Hon. E. M. Stanton, \" Secretary of War.\" I had provided a small siege train and moderate supplies of intrenching tools for such a contingency as the present. Immediate steps were taken to secure the necessary additions. While the 'engineer officers were engaged in ascertaining the character and strength of all the defences, and the con figuration of the ground in front of Yorktown, in order to determine the point of attack and to develop the approaches, the troops were occupied in opening roads to the depots established at the nearest available points, on branches of York river. Troops were brought to the front as rapidly as possible, and on the 10th of April the army was posted as follows : Heintzelman's corps, composed of Porter's, Hooker's, and Hamilton's divi sions, in front of Yorktown, extending in the order named, from the mouth of Wormley's creek to the Warwick road, opposite Winn's mills. Sumner's corps \u2014 Sedgwick's division only having arrived \u2014 on the left of Hamilton,"], [88, "80 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. extending down to Warwick and opposite to Winn's mills works. Keyes's corps (Smith's, Couch's, and Casey's divisions,) on the left of Sedgwick, facing the works at the one-gun battery, Lee's mills, &c, on the west bank of the Warwick. Sumner, after the 6th of April, commanded the left wing, composed of his own and Keyes's corps. Throughout the preparations for, and during the siege of Yorktown, I kept the corps under General Keyes, and afterwards the left wing, under General Sumner, engaged in ascertaining the character of the obstacles presented by the Warwick, and the enemy intrenched upon the right bank, with the intention, if possible, of overcoming them and breaking that line of defence, so as to gain possession of the road to Williamsburg, and cut off Yorktown from its supports and supplies. The forces under General Heint zelman were engaged in similar efforts upon the works between Winn's mills and Yorktown. General Keyes's report of the 16th of April, enclosing reports of brigade commanders engaged in reconnoissances up to that day, said, \"that no part of his (the enemy's line opposite his own) line, so far as discovered, can be taken by assault without an enormous waste of life.\" Reconnoissances on the right flank demonstrated the fact that the War wick was not passable in that direction, except over a narrow dam, the approaches to which were swept by several batteries, and intrenchments which could be filled quickly with supports sheltered by the timber immedi ately in rear. , General Barnard, chief engineer of the army of the Potomac, whose posi tion entitled his opinions to the highest consideration, expressed the judg ment that those formidable works could not, with any reasonable degree of certainty, be carried by assault. General Keyes, commanding 4th army corps, after the examination of the enemy's defences on the left, before alluded to, addressed the following letter to the Hon. Ira Harris, United States Senate, and gave me a copy. Although not strictly official, it de scribes the situation at that time in some respects so well, that I have taken the liberty of introducing it here: \" Headquarters 4th Corps, \" Warivick Court House, Va., April 7, 1862. \"My Dear Senator : The plan of campaign on this line was made with the distinct understanding that four army corps should be employed, and that the navy should co-operate in the taking of Yorktown, and also (as I under stood it) support us on our left by moving gunboats up James river. \"To-day I have learned that the 1st corps, which by the President's or der was to embrace four divisions, and one division (Blenker's) of the 2d corps, have been withdrawn altogether from this line of operations, and from the army of the Potomac. At the same time, as I am informed, the navy has not the means to attack Yorktown, and is afraid to send gunboats up James river, for fear of the Merrimack. \" The above plan of campaign was adopted unanimously by Major General McDowell and Brigadier Generals Sumner* Heintzelman, and Keyes, and was concurred in by Major General McClellan, who first proposed Urbana as our base. \" This army being reduced by forty-five thousand troops, some of them among the best in the service, and without the support of the navy, the plan to which we are reduced bears scarcely any resemblance to the one I voted for. \" I command the James river column, and I left my camp near Newport News the morning of the 4th instant. I only succeeded in getting my artillery ashore the afternoon of the day before, and one of my divisions had i ot all arrived in camp the day I left, and for the want of transportation"], [89, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 81 has not yet joined me. So you will \"observe that not a day was lost in the advance, and in fact we marched so quickly, and so rapidly, that many of our animals were twenty-four and forty-eight hours without a ration of forage. But notwithstanding the rapidity of our advance, we were stopped by a line of defence nine or ten miles long, strongly fortified by breast works, erected nearly the whole distance behind a stream, or succession of ponds, nowhere fordable, one terminus being Yorktown, and the other ending in the James river, which is commanded by the enemy's gunboats. York town is fortified all around with bastioned works, and on the water side it and Gloucester are so strong that the navy are afraid to attack either. \" The approaches on one side are generally through low, swampy, or thickly wooded ground, over roads which we are obliged to repair or to make before we can get forward our carriages. The enemy is in great force, and is constantly receiving re-enforcements from the two rivers. The line in front of us is therefore one of the strongest ever opposed to an in vading force in any country. \" You will, then, ask why I advocated such a line for our operations ? My reasons are few, but I think good. \" With proper assistance from the navy we could take Yorktown, and then with gunboats on both rivers we could beat any force opposed to us on Warwick river, because the shot and shell from the gunboats would nearly overlap across the Peninsula ; so that if the enemy should retreat \u2014 and retreat he must \u2014 he would have a long way to go without rail or steam transportation, and every soul of his army must fall into our hands or be destroyed. \"Another reason for my supporting the new base and plan was, that this line, it was expected, would furnish water transportation nearly to Rich mond. \" Now, supposing we succeed in breaking through the line in front of us, what can we do next? The roads are very bad, and if the enemy retains command of James river, and we do not first reduce Yorktown, it would be impossible for us to subsist this army three marches beyond where it is now. As the roads are at present, it is with the utmost difficulty that we can subsist it in the position it now occupies. \" You will see, therefore, by what I have said, that the force originally intended for the capture of Richmond should be all sent forward. If I thought the four army corps necessary when I supposed the navy would co-operate, and when I judged of the obstacles to be encountered by what I learned from maps and the opinions of officers long stationed at Fort Monroe, and from all other sources, how much more should I think the full complement of troops requisite now that the navy cannot co-operate, and now that the strength of the enemy's lines and the number of his guns and men prove to be almost immeasurably greater than I had been led to expect. The line in front of us, in the opinion of all the military men here, who are at all competent to judge, is one of the strongest in the world, and the force of the enemy capable of being increased beyond the numbers we now have to oppose to him. Independently of the strength of the lines in front of us, and of the force of the enemy behind them, we cannot advance until we get command of either York river or James river. The efficient co-operation of the navy is, therefore, absolutely essential, and so I considered it when I voted to change our base from the Potomac to Fort Monroe. \" An iron-clad boat must attack Yorktown; and if several strong gunboats could be sent up James river also, our success will be certain and complete, and the rebellion will soon be put down. \"On the other hand, we must butt against the enemy's works with heavy artillery, and a great waste of time, life, and material. H. Ex. Doc. 15 6"], [90, "82 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. \"If we break through and advance, both our flanks will be assailed from two great water-courses in the hands of the enemy ; our supplies would give out, and the enemy, equal if not superior in numbers, would, with the other advantages, beat and destroy this army. \"The greatest master of the art of war has said, 'that if you would in vade a country successfully you must have one line of operations, and one army, under one general.' But what is our condition ? The State of Vir ginia is made to constitute the command, in part or wholly, of some six gen erals, viz : Fremont, Banks, McDowell, Wool, Burnside, and McClellan, besides the scrap over the Chesapeake, in the care of Dix. \" The great battle of the war is to come off here. If we win it, the rebel lion will be crushed \u2014 if we lose it, the consequences will be more horrible than I care to tell. The plan of campaign I voted for, if carried out with the means proposed, will certainly succeed. If any part of the means pro posed are withheld or diverted, I deem it due to myself to say that our success will be uncertain. \" It is no doubt agreeable to the commander of the 1st corps to have a separate department, and as this letter advocates his return to General McClellan's command, it is proper to state that I arn not at all influenced by personal regard or dislike to any of my seniors in rank. If I were to credit all the opinions which have been poured into my ears, I must believe that, in regard to my present fine command, I owe much to General McDowell and nothing to General McClellan. But I have disregarded all such officiousness, and I have from last July to the present day supported General McClellan, and obeyed all his orders with as hearty a good will as though he had been my brother or the friend to whom I owed most. I shall continue to do so to the last, and so long as he is my commander. And I am not desirous to displace him, and would not if I could. He left Washington with the un derstanding that he was to execute a definite plan of campaign with certain prescribed means. The plan was good and the means sufficient, and with out modification the enterprise was certain of success. But with the reduc tion of force and means, the plan is entirely changed, and is now a bad plan, with means insufficient for certain success. \" Do not look upon this communication as the offspring of despondency. I never despond ; and when you see me working the hardest, you may be sure that fortune is frowning upon me. I am working now to my utmost. \" Please show this letter to the President, and I should like also that Mr. Stanton should know its contents.

Secretary of War informs me that the forwarding of transportation, ammunition, and Woodbury's brigade, under your orders, is not, and will not be, interfered with.

General Sumner's corps is on the road to join you, and will go forward as fast as possible. Franklin's division is now on the advance towards Manassas. There is no means of transportation here to send it forward in time to be of service in your present operations. Tele graph frequently, and all in the power of the government shall be done to sustain you as occasion may require. \"E. M. STANTON, \" Secretary of War. \" General G. B. McClellan.\" By the 9th of April I had acquired a pretty good knowledge of the posi tion and strength of the enemy's works, and the obstacles to be overcome. On that day I received the following letter from the President : \"Washington, April 9, 1862. \" My Dear Sir : Your despatches complaining that you are not properly sustained, while they do not offend me, do pain me very much. \" Blenker's division was withdrawn from you before you left here, and you know the pressure under which I did it, and, as I thought, acquiesced in it\u2014 certainly not without reluctance. \" After you left I ascertained that less than 20,000 unorganized men, without a single field battery, were all you designed to be left for the de- fence of Washington and Manassas Junction, and part of this even was to go to General Hooker's old position. General Banks's corps, once designed for Manassas Junction, was diverted and tied up on the line of Winchester and Strasburg, and could not leave it without again exposing the upper Poto- mac and the Baltimore and Ohio railroad. This presented, or would pre- sent, when McDowell and Sumner should be gone, a great temptation to the enemy to turn back from the Rappahannock and sack Washington. My implicit order that Washington should, by the judgment of all the com- manders of army corps, be left entirely secure, had been neglected. It was precisely this that drove me to detain McDowell. \" I do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement to leave Banks at Manassas Junction ; but when that arrangement was broken up, and nothing was substituted for it, of course I was constrained to substi tute something for it myself. And allow me to ask, do you really think I should permit the line from Richmond, via Manassas Junction, to this city, to be entirely open, except what resistance could be presented by less than 20,000 unorganized troops ? This is a question which the country will not allow me to evade. \" There is a curious mystery about the number of troops now with you. When I telegraphed you on the 6th, saying you had over a hundred-thou sand with you, I had just obtained from the Secretary of War a statement taken, as he said, from your own returns, making 108,000 then with you and en route to you. You now say you will have but 85,000 when all en route to you shall have reached you. How can the discrepancy of 23,000 be accounted for ? \"As to General Wool's command, I understand it is doing for you precisely what a like number of your own would have to do if that oommand was away. \" I suppose the whole force which has gone forward for you is with you by this time. And if so, I think it is the precise time for you to strike a blow. By delay the enemy will relatively gain upon you\u2014 that is, he will"], [92, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. m'cLELLAN. 84 gain faster by fortifications and re-enforcements than you can by re-enforce ments alone. And once more let me tell you, it is indispensable to you that you strike a blow. I am powerless to help this. You will do me the jus tice to remember I always insisted that going down the bay in search of a field, instead of fighting at or near Manassas, was only shifting, and not surmounting, a difficulty; that we would find the same enemy, and the same or equal intrenchments, at either place. The country will not fail to note, is now noting, that the present hesitation to move upon an intrenched enemy is but the story of Manassas repeated. \"I beg to assure you that I have never written you or spoken to you in greater kindness of feeling than now, nor with a fuller purpose to sustain you, so far as, in my most anxious judgment, I consistently can. But you must act. \" Yours, very truly, \"A. LINCOLN. \" Major General McClellan.\" With great deference to the opinions and wishes of his excellency the President, I most respectfully beg leave to refer to the facts which I have presented and those contained in the accompanying letter of General Keyes, with the reports of General Barnard and other officers, as furnishing a reply to the above letter. His excellency could not judge of the formidable character of the works before us as well as if he had been on the ground ; and whatever might have been his desire for prompt action, (certainly no greater than mine,) I feel confident if he could have made a personal inspec tion of the enemy's defences, he would have forbidden me risking the safety of the army and the possible successes of the campaign on a sanguinary assault of an advantageous and formidable position, which, even if success ful, could not have been followed up to any other or better result than would have been reached by the regular operations of a siege. Still less could I forego the conclusions of my most instructed judgment for the mere sake of avoiding the personal consequences intimated in the Presi dent's despatch. The following extracts from the report of the chief engineer (Brigadier General J. G. Barnard) embody the result of our reconnoissances, and give, with some degree of detail, the character and strength of the defences of Yorktown and the Warwick, and some of the obstacles which the army contended against and overcame. Extracts from General Barnard's report. \"The accompanying drawing (map No. 2) gives with accuracy the out line and armament of the fortifications of Yorktown proper, with the de tached works immediately connected with it. \" The three bastioned fronts, looking towards our approaches, appear to have been earliest built, and have about fifteen feet thickness of parapet and eight feet to ten feet depth of ditch, the width varying much, but never being less at top of scarp than fifteen feet \u2014 I think generally much more. \"The works extending around the town, from the western salient of fronts just mentioned, appear to have been finished during the past winter and spring. They have formidable profiles, eighteen feet thickness of parapet, and generals ten feet depth of ditch. \" The water batteries had generally eighteen feet parapet, the guns in barbette. \" They were (as well as all the works mentioned) carefully constructed with well-made sod revetments."], [93, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 85 \"There were numerous traverses between the guns, and ample magazines ; how sufficient in bomb-proof qualities I am unable to say. \" The two first guns of the work on the heights bear upon the water as well as the land, and were of heavy calibre. \" The list herewith gives all the guns in position, or for which there were emplacements. The vacant emplacements were all occupied before the evacuation by siege guns, rifled 4j-inch 24-pounders, and 18-pounders. \"In Fort Magruder (the first exterior work) there were found one 8-inch columbiad, one 42-pounder, and one 8-inch siege howitzer; the two former in barbette. The sketch will show the emplacements for guns on field and siege carriages; making, I think, with the foregoing, twenty-two. Two of these were placed behind traverses, with embrasures covered by blindages. \" The two external redoubts, with the connecting parapets, formed a re-entrant with the fronts of attack, and all the guns bore on our ap proaches. \" It will be seen, therefore, that our approaches were swept by the fire of at least forty-nine guns, nearly all of which were heavy, and many of them the most formidable guns known. Besides that, two-thirds of the guns of the water batteries and all the guns of Gloucester bore on our right batteries, though under disadvantageous circumstances. \"The ravine behind which the left of the Yorktown fronts of attack was placed was not very difficult, as the heads formed depressions in front of their left, imperfectly seen by their fire, and from which access could be had to the ditches; but we could not be sure of the fact before the evacua tion. The enemy held, by means of a slight breastwork and rifle trenches, a position in advance of the heads of these ravines as far forward as the burnt house. \"The ravines which head between the Yorktown fortifications and the exterior works are deep and intricate. They were tolerably well seen, how ever, by the works which run westwardly from the Yorktown works, and which were too numerous and complicated to be traced on paper. \" Fort Magruder, the first lunette on our left, appears to have been built at an early period. \" The external connexion between this work was first a rifle trench, pro bably afterwards enlarged into a parapet, with external ditch and an em placement for four guns in or near the small redan in the centre. \"Behind this they had constructed numerous epaulments, with connecting boyaus not fully arranged for infantry fires, and mainly intended probably to protect their camps and reserves against the destructive effects of our artillery. \" From the ' red redoubt' these trenches and epaulments ran to the woods and rivulet which forms one head of the Warwick, and continue almost without break to connect with the works at Wynn's mill. This stream, just mentioned, whatever be its name, (the term ' Warwick,' according to eome, applying only to the tidal channel from the James river up as high as Lee's mill,) was inundated by a number of dams from near where its head is crossed by the epaulments mentioned down to Lee's mill. \" Below Lee's mill the Warwick follows a tortuous course through salt marshes of two hundred yards or three hundred yards in width, from which the land rises up boldly to a height of thirty or forty feet. \"The first group of works is at Wynn's mill, where there is a dam and bridge. The next is to guard another dam between Wynn's and Lee's mills; (this is the point attacked by General Smith on the 16th ultimo, and where Lieutenant Merrill was wounded; the object of the attack was merely to prevent the further construction of works and feel the strength of the position.) A work, of what strength is not known, was at the sharp angle of"], [94, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 86 the stream just above Lee's mill, and a formidable group of works was at Lee's mill, where there was also a dam and bridge. \" From Lee's mill a line of works extends across Mulberry island, or is supposed to do so. \" At SouthaPs landing is another formidable group of works, and from here, too, they extend apparently across to the James river. \"These groups of field-works were connected by rifle trenches or parapets for nearly the whole distance. \" They are far more extensive than may be supposed from the mention of of them I make, and every kind of obstruction which the country affords, such as abattis, marsh, inundation, &c, was skilfully used. The line is certainly one of she most extensive known to modern times. \" The country on both sides of the Warwick, from near Yorktown down, is a dense forest with few clearings. It was swampy, and the roads impas sable during the heavy rains we have constantly had, except where our own labors had corduroyed them. \" If we could have broken the enemy's line across the isthmus we could have invested Yorktown, and it must, with its garrison, have soon fallen into our hands. It was not deemed practicable, considering the strength of that line and the difficulty of handling our forces, (owing to the imprac ticable character of the country,) to do so. \" If we could take Yorktown, or drive the enemy out of that place, the enemy's line was no longer tenable. This we could do by siege operations. It was deemed too hazardous to attempt the reduction of the place by assault.\" The plan of the approaches and their defences as determined upon and finally executed is exhibited on the accompanying map, (No. \u2014 . ) It was, in words, to open the first parallel as near as possible to the works of the enemy, and under its protection to establish almost simultaneously batteries along the whole front, extending from York river on the right to the War- wick on the left, a cord of about one mile in length. The principal ap- proaches were directed against the east end of the main work, which was most heavily armed aud bore both on the water aud land, and lay between Wormley's creek and York river. There also were placed the most of the batteries designed to act against the land front to enfilade the water bat- teries, and to act upon Gloucester. 1 designed at the earliest moment to open simultaneously with several batteries, and as soon as the enemy's guns, which swept the neck of land between Wormley's creek and the Warwick, were crippled and their fire kept down, to push the trenches as far forward as necessary and to assault Yorktown and the adjacent works. The approaches to the batteries, the necessary bridges, and the roads to the depots, had been vigorously pushed to completion by the troops under Generals Heintzelman and Sumner, and were available for infantry, and in some instances for artillery, on the 17th of April, when the batteries and their connexions were commenced, and labor upon them kept up night and day until finished. Some of the batteries on easy ground and concealed from the view of the enemy were early completed and armed, and held ready for any emergency, but not permitted to open, as the return fire of the enemy would interfere too much with the labor on other and more import ant works. The completion of the more exposed and heaviest batteries was delayed by storms, preventing the landing of guns and ammunition. It having been discovered that the enemy were receiving artillery stores at the wharf in Yorktown, on May 1 battery No. 1 was opened with effect upon the wharf and town. On the 22d of April General Franklin, with his division from General"], [95, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 87 McDowell's corps, had at rived and reported to me. The garrison of Glou cester point had been re-enforced and the works strengthened; but as this division was too small to detach to the Severn, and no more troops could be spared, I determined to act on Gloucester b}' disembarking it on the north bank of the York river, under the protection of the gunboats. The troops were mainly kept on board ship while the necessary preparations were made for landing them, and supporting them in case of necessity. For a full account of this labor I refer to the report of Lieutenant Colonel B. S. Alexander, of the engineer corps, detailed for this expedition. While the siege works were being rapidly completed, the roads on the left wing necessary for communication and advance were opened and cordu royed over the marshes, batteries were erected to silence the enemy's guns, and drive him from his works at Wynn's and Lee's mills, preparatory to the general attack. Active reconnoissances were continually going on, and attempts in force made to drive the enemy from the banks. The result of various reconnoissances made under the immediate direction of General W. F. Smith, commanding second division fourth corps, led to the belief that the weakest point of that part of the enemy's lines was oppo site a field where it was ascertained that there was a dam covered by a bat tery known to contain at least one gun. It was determined to push a strong reconnoissance on this point to silence the enemy's fire, and ascertain the actual strength of the position. Being prepared to sustain the reconnoitring party by a real attack, if found expe dient, General W. F. Smith was directed to undertake the operation on the 16th of April. He silenced the fire of the enemy's guns, discovered the existence of other works previously concealed and unknown, and sent a strong party across the stream, which was finally forced to retire with some loss. Smith intrenched himself in a position immediately overlooking the dam and the enemy's works, so as to keep them under control, and prevent the enemy from using the dam as a means of crossing the Warwick to an noy us. Many times towards the end of the month the enemy attempted to drive in our pickets, and take our rifle-pits near Yorktown, but always without success. As the siege progressed, it was with great difficulty that the rifle-pits on the right could be excavated and held, so little covering could be made against the hot fire of the enemy's artillery and infantry. Their guns con- tinued firing up to a late hour of the night of the 3d of May. Our batteries would have been ready to open on the morning of the 6th May at latest; but on the morning of the 4th it was discovered that the enemy had already been compelled to evacuate his position during the night, leaving behind him all his heavy guns, uninjured, aud a large amount of ammunition and supplies. For the details of the labor of the siege I re- fer to the accompanying reports and journals of Brigadier General J. G. Barnard, chief engineer, charged with the selections, laying out, and com- pletion of the approaches and batteries; of Brigadier General Wm. F. Barry, chief of artillery, charged with arming and supplying with ammuni- tion all the siege and field batteries; and of Brigadier General Fitz-John Porter, director of the siege, to whom were assigned the guarding of the trenches, the assembling and distribution of the working parties, &c, &c. Early in the morning of the 4th, on the enemy's abandoning his lines at Yorktown, I ordered all the available cavalry force, with four batteries of horse artillery, under Brigadier General Stoneman, chief of cavalry, in im mediate pursuit by the Yorktown and Williamsburg road, with orders to harass the enemy's rear, and try to cut off such of his forces as had taken the Lee's mill and Williamsburg road."], [96, "88 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. General Heintzelman was directed to send Hooker's division forward oh the Yorktown and Williamsburg road to support General Stoneman ; and Smith was ordered to proceed with his division upon the Lee's mill and Williamsburg road for the same purpose. Afterwards, the divisions of Generals Kearney, Couch, and Casey, wore put en route \u2014 the first on the Yorktown road, and the others on the Lee's mill road. These roads unite about a quarter of a mile south of Fort Magruder, and are connected by cross-roads at several points between Yorktown and Williamsburg. After these directions had been given, General Sumner (the officer second in rank in the army of the Potomac) was ordered to proceed to the front and take immediate charge of operations until my arrival. General Stoneman moved forward promptly with his command, consist ing of four batteries of horse artillery under Lieutenant Colonel Hays, the 1st and 6th United States cavalry, the 3d Pennsylvania and 8th Illinois, and Barker's squadron, meeting with but little opposition until he arrived in front of the enemy's works about two miles east of Williamsburg. At a point about eight miles from Yorktown, in accordance with my instructions, he detached General Emory with Benson's battery, the 3d Pennsylvania cavalry, (Colonel Averill,) and Barker's squadron, to gain the Lee's mill road, and endeavor, with the assistance of General Smith, to cut off the portion of the enemy's rellr guard which had taken that route. General Emory had some sharp skirmishes with a regiment of cavalry and a battery under General Stuart, and drove them in the direction of Lee's mill. General Smith having met with obstructions in his front, had transferred his column, by a cross-road, to the Yorktown and Williamsburg road, so that General Emory, finding no force to co-operate with him, was unable to cut off the rear guard, and they succeeded in escaping by a circuitous route along the bank of the James river. The position in which General Stoneman encountered the enemy is about four miles in extent, the right resting on College creek, and the left on Queen's creek ; nearly three-fourths of its front being covered by tributaries of these two creeks, upon which there are ponds. The ground between the heads of the boundary streams is a cultivated plain, across which a line of detached works had been constructed, consist ing of Fort Magruder, a large work in the centre with a bastion front, and twelve other redoubts and epaulments for field guns. The parapet of Fort Magruder is about six feet high and nine feet thick; the ditch nine feet wide and nine feet deep, filled with water. The length of the interior crest is about 600 yards. The redoubts have strong profiles, but are of small dimensions, having faces of about forty yards. The woods is front of the position were felled, and the open ground in front of the works was dotted with numerous rifle-pits. The roads leading from the lower part of the Peninsula to Williamsburg, one along the York river, (the Yorktown road,) and the other along the James, (the Lee's mill road,) unite between the heads of the tributary streams a short distance in front of Fort Magruder, by which they are com manded, and debouch from the woods just before uniting. A branch from the James river road leaves it about one and three-fourths of a mile below Fort Magruder and unites with the road from Allen's landing to Williams burg, which crosses the tributary of College creek over a dam at the outlet of the pond, and passes just in rear of the line of works, being commanded by the three redoubts on the right of the line, at about the same distance from Fort Magruder. A branch leaves the York river road and crosses the tribu tary of Queen's creek on a dam, and passing over the position and through"], [97, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 89 the works in its rear, finally enters Williamsburg ; this road is commanded by redoubts on the left of the line of the works. General Stoneman debouched from the woods with his advance guard, (consisting of a part of the 1st United States cavalry, and one section of Gibson's battery, under the command of General Cooke,) and the enemy im mediately opened on him with several field-pieces from Fort Magruder, hav ing the correct range, and doing some execution. Gibson's battery was brought into position as rapidly as the deep mud would permit, and returned the fire ; while the 6th United States cavalry was sent to feel the enemy's left. This regiment passed one redoubt, which it found unoccupied, and appeared in the rear of a second, when a strong cavalry force, with infantry and artillery, came down upon it, whereupon the regiment was withdrawn. The rear squadron, under command of Captain Saunders, repelled a charge of the enemy's cavalry in the most gallant manner. In the mean time the enemy was being re enforced by infantry ; and the artillery sire becoming very hot, General Stoneman, having no infantry to carry the works, ordered the withdrawal of the battery. This was accomplished, with the exception of one piece, which could not be extricated from the mud. The enemy attempted to prevent the movement, but their charges were met by the 1st United States cavalry, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Grier, and they were driven back, losing several officers and one stand of colors. General Stoneman then took a defensive position a short distance in the rear of the first, to await the arrival of the infantry. The advance of General Smith's column reached Skiff's creek about ll1 o'clock, and found the bridge over that stream in flames, and the road im passable. A practicable route to the Yorktown road having been discov ered, the division, by order of General Sumner, moved on by that road, and reached General Stoneman's position about 5| o'clock. General Sumner, arriving with it, assumed command. Generals Heintzelman aud Keyes also arrived. During the afternoon of the 4th, near the Halfway House, the head of General Hooker's column encountered Smith's division filing into the road, and was obliged to halt between three and four hours until it had passed. General Hooker then followed on, and at Cheesecake church turned off, by General Heintzelman's direction, taking a cross-road, and moved out on the Lee's mill road, thus changing places with General Smith. Marching part of the night, he came in sight of Fort Magruder early in the morning of the 5th. General Smith's division having been deployed, General Sumner ordered an attack on the works in his front ; but the lines having been thrown into confusion while moving through the dense forest, and darkness coming on, the attempt for that night was abandoned. The troops bivouacked in the woods, and a heavy rain began, which continued until the morning of the 6th, making the roads, already in very bad condition, almost impassable. During the morning of the 5th General Sumner reconnoitred the position in his front, and at 1 1 o'clock ordered Hancock's brigade, of Smith's division, to take possession of a work on the enemy's left, which had been found to be unoccupied. The remainder of Smith's division occupied the woods in front without being actually engaged. The divisions of Couch and Casey had received orders during the night to march at daylight ; but on account of the terrible condition of the roads, and other impediments, were not able to reach the field until after 1 o'clock p. m., at which time the first brigade of Couch's division arrived, and was posted in the centre, on Hooker's right. The other two brigades came up during the afternoon, followed by Casey's division. In the mean time General Hooker, having reconnoitred the enemy's po sition, began the attack at 7^ a. m., and for a while silenced the guns of"], [98, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 90 Fort Magruder, and cleared the ground in his front ; but the enemy being continually re-enforced, until their strength greatly exceeded his, made attack after attack, endeavoring to turn his left. For several hours his division struggled gallantly against the superior numbers of the enemy. Five guns of Webber's battery were lost, and be- tween three and four o'clock his ammunition began to give out. The loss had been heavy, and the exhaustion of the troops was very great. At this time the division of General Kearney came up, who, at 9 a. m., had received orders to re-enforce Hooker, and who had succeeded, by the greatest exer- tions, in passing Casey's troops, and pushing on to the front through the deep mud. General Kearney at once gallantly attacked, and thereby pre- vented the loss of another battery, and drove the enemy back at every point, enabling General Hooker to extricate himself from his position, and with- draw his wearied troops. Peck's brigade, of Couch's division, as has been mentioned before, was, immediately on its arrival, ordered by General Sum- ner to deploy on Hooker's right. This was promptly done, and the attacks of the enemy at that point were repulsed. General Peck held his position until late in the afternoon, when he was relieved by the other two brigades of Couch's division, and they were in quiet possession of the ground when night closed the contest. The vigorous action of these troops relieved Gen- eral Hooker considerably. General Emory had been left with his command, on the night of the 4th, to guard the branch of the Lee's mill road which leads to Allen's farm ; and on the morning of the 5th it was ascertained that by this route the enemy's right could be turned. A request for infantry for this purpose was made to General Heintzelman, who, late in the after- noon, sent four regiments and two batteries of Kearney's division \u2014 the first disposable troops he had \u2014 and directed General Emory to make the attack. With these re-enforcements his force amounted to about 3,000 men and three batteries. General Emory, on account of want of knowledge of the ground, and the lateness of the hour, did not succeed in this movement. It involved some risks, but, if successful, might have produced important results. At 11 a. m., as before mentioned, General Smith received orders from General Sumner to send one brigade across a dam on our right, to occupy a redoubt on the left of the enemy's line. Hancock's brigade was selected for this purpose. He crossed the dam, took possession of the first redoubt, and afterwards, finding the second one vacated, he occupied that also, and sent for re-enforcements to enable him to advance further and take the next redoubt, which commanded the plain between his position and Fort Magru der, and would have enabled him to take in reverse and cut the communi cation of the troops engaged with Generals Hooker and Kearney. The enemy soon began to show himself in strength before him, and as his rear and right flank were somewhat exposed, he repeated his request for re-enforcements. General Smith was twice ordered to join him, with the rest of his division, but each time the order was countermanded at the mo ment of execution, General Sumner not being willing to weaken the centre. At length, in reply to General Hancock's repeated messages for more troops, General Sumner sent him an order to fall back to his first position, the execution of which General Hancock deferred as long as possible, being unwilling to give up the advantage already gained, and fearing to expose his command by such a movement. During the progress of these events, I had remained at Yorktown to com plete the preparations for the departure of General Franklin's and other troops to West Point by water, and to make the necessary arrangements with the naval commander for his co-operation. By pushing General Franklin, well supported by water, to the right bank of the Pamunkey, opposite West Point, it was hoped to force the enemy to"], [99, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 91 abandon whatever works he might have on the Peninsula below that point, or be cut off. It was of paramount importance that the arrangements to this end should be promptly made at an early hour of the morning. I had sent two of my^ids (Lieutenant Colonel Sweitzer and Major Hammerstein) to observe the operations in front, with instructions to report to me every thing of importance that might occur. I received no information from them leading me to suppose that there was anything occurring of more importance than a simple affair of a rear-guard, until about one o'clock p. m., when a despatch arrived from one of them that everything was not progressing favorably. This was confirmed a few minutes later by the reports of Governor Sprague and Major Hammerstein, who came directly from the scene of action. Completing the necessary arrangements, I returned to my camp without delay, rode rapidly to the front, a distance of some fourteen miles, through roads much obstructed by troops and wagons, and reached the field between four and five p. m., in time to take a rapid survey of the ground. I soon learned that there was no direct communication between our centre and the left under General Heintzelman; the centre was chiefly in the nearer edge of the woods, situated between us and the enemy. As heavy firing was heard in the direction of General Hancock's command, I immediately ordered General Smith to proceed with his two remaining brigades to sup- port that part of the line. General Naglee, with his brigade, received similar orders. I then directed our centre to advance to the further edge of the woods mentioned above, which was done, and I attempted to open direct communication with General Heintzelman, but was prevented by the marshy state of the ground in the direction in which the attempt was made. Before Generals Smith and Naglee could reach the field of General Han- cock's operations, although they moved with great rapidity, he had been confronted by a superior force. Feigning to retreat slowly, he awaited their onset, and then turned upon them, and after some terrific volleys of musketry, he charged them with the bayonet, routing and dispersing their whole force, killing, wounding, and capturing from 500 to 600 men, he himself losing only 31 men. This was one of the most brilliant engagements of the war, and General Hancock merits the highest praise for the soldierly qualities displayed, and his perfect appreciation of the vital importance of his position. Night put an end to the operations here, and all the troops who had been engaged in this contest slept on the muddy field, without shelter, and many without food. Notwithstanding the report I received from General Heintzelman, during the night, that General Hooker's, division had suffered so much that it could not be relied on next day, and that Kearney's could not do more than hold its own without re-enforcements \u2014 being satisfied that the result of Hancock's engagement was to give us possession of the decisive point of the battle- field during the night, I countermanded the order for the advance of the divisions of Sedgwick and Richardson, and directed them to return to York- town, to proceed to West Point by water. Our loss during the day, the greater part of which was sustained by Hooker's division, was as follows: Killed, 456; wounded, 1,400; missing, 372; total, 2,228. On the next morning we found the enemy's position abandoned, and occu pied Fort Magruder and the town of Williamsburg, which was filled with the enemy's wounded, to whose assistance eighteen of their surgeons were sent by General J. E. Johnston, the officer in command. Several guns and caissons, which the enemy could not carry off on account of the mud, were secured. Colonel Averill was sent forward at once with a strong cavalry"], [100, "92 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. force to endeavor to overtake the enemy's rear-guard. He found several guns abandoned, and picked up a large number of stragglers, but the con dition of the roads and the state of the supplies forced him to return, after advancing a few miles. It is my opinion that the enemy opposed us here with only a portion of his army. When our cavalry first appeared there was nothing but the enemy's rear-guard in Williamsburg. Other troops were brought back during the night and the next day to hold the works as long as possible, in order to gain time for the trains, &c, already well on the way to Richmond, to make their escape. Our troops were greatly exhausted by the laborious march through the mud from their positions in front of Yorktown, and by the protracted battle through which they had just passed. Many of them were out of rations and ammunition, and one division, in its anxiety to make a prompt movement, had marched with empty haversacks. The supply trains had been forced out of the roads on the fourth and fifth to allow the troops and artillery to pass to the front, and the roads were now in such a state, after thirty-six hours' continuous rain, that it was almost impossible to pass even empty wagons over them. General Hooker's division had suffered so severely that it was in no condition to follow the enemy, even if the roads had been good. Under these circumstances, an immediate pursuit was impossible. Steps were at once taken to care for and remove the wounded, and to bring up provisions, ammunition, and forage. The condition of the roads, as has been said, rendered it next to impos sible to accomplish this by laud from Yorktown. A temporary depot was therefore promptly established on Queen's creek, and supplies drawn, and the wounded shipped from that place. The divisions of Franklin, Sedgwick, Porter, and Richardson were sent from Yorktown by water to the right bank of the Pamunkey, in the vicinity of West Point. The remaining divisions, the trains, and the reserve ar tillery moved subsequently by land. Early on the morning of the 7th General Franklin had completed the disembarcation of his division, and had placed it in a good position to cover the landing place, both his flanks and a large portion of his front being pro tected by water. Dana's brigade of Sedgwick's division arrived during the morning. At about 9 a. m. a large force of the enemy appeared, consisting of Whiting's division and other troops, and between 10 and 11 they attacked the part of the line held by Newton's brigade. The action continued until 3 p. m., when the enemy retired, all his at tacks having been repulsed. This affair, the most important in which the division had yet been engaged, was highly creditable to General Franklin and his command. For the details I refer to his report, which is herewith submitted. Our loss was 49 killed, 104 wounded, and 41 missing. Total, 194, which includes a large proportion of officers Cavalry reconnoissances were sent out from Williamsburg on the 6th and 7th, and on the 8th General Stoneman moved with an advance guard of cav alry, artillery, and infantry to open communication with General Franklin. As soon as our supplies had been received and the condition of the roads had become a little better, though still very bad, the advance of the remain ing troops was begun, Smith's division moving on the 8th. On the 10th headquarters were at Roper's church, 19 miles from Williamsburg, all the divisions which had moved by land, except Hooker's, being in the vicinity of that place. We were now in direct communication with the portion of the army which had gone by water, and we began to draw supplies from them."], [101, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 93 On account of the small number and narrowness of the roads in this neighborhood, movements were difficult and slow. On the 15th, headquarters and the divisions of Franklin, Porter, Sykes, and Smith reached Cumberland, which was made a temporary depot. Couch and Casey were then near New Kent Court House, Hooker and Kearney near Roper's church and Riclardson and Sedgwick near Eltham. On the 14th and 15th much rain fell. On the 15th and 16th the divisions of Franklin, Smith, and Porter were with great difficulty moved to White House, five miles in advance. So bad was the road that the train of one of these divisions required thirty-six hours to pass over this short distance. General Stoneman had occupied this place some days before, after several successful skirmishes, in which our cavalry proved superior to that of the enemy. The reports of these affairs are appended. About this time, with the consent of the President, two additional corps were organized, viz: the 5th provisional corps, consisting of the divisions of Porter and Sykes, and the reserve artillery, under the command of General F. J. Porter, and the 6th provisional corps, consisting of the divisions of Franklin and Smith, under the command of General W. B Franklin. Headquarters reached White House on the 16th, and a permanent depot was at once organized there. On the 19th, headquarters and the corps of Porter and Franklin moved to Tunstall's station, five miles from White House. On the 20th more rain fell. On the 21st the position of the troops was as follows: Stoneman's ad vance guard, one mile from New bridge; Franklin's corps three miles from New bridge, with Porter's corps at supporting distance in its rear; Sumner's corps, on the railroad about three miles from the Chickahominy, connecting the right with the left ; Keyes's corps, on New Kent road, near Bottom's bridge, with Heintzelman's corps at supporting distance in the rear. The ford at Bottom's bridge was in our possession, and the rebuilding of the bridge, which had been destroyed by the enemy, was commenced. On the 22d, headquarters moved to Coal Harbor. On the 26th the railroad was in operation as far as the Chickahominy, and the railroad bridge across that stream nearly completed. CHAPTER II. When, on the 20th of May, our advanced light troops reached the banks of the Chickahominy river, at Bottom's bridge, they found that this as well as the railroad bridge, about a mile above, had been destroyed by the enemy. The Chickahominy in this vicinity is about forty feet wide, fringed with a dense growth of heavy forest trees, and bordered by low marshy bottom lands, varying from half a mile to a mile in width. Our operations embraced that part of the river between Bottom's and Meadow bridges, which covered the principal approaches to Richmond from the east. Within these limits the firm ground lying above high-water mark seldom ap proaches near the river on either bank, and no locality was found within this section where the high ground came near the stream on both sides. It was subject to frequent, sudden, and great variations in the volume of water, and a rise of a few feet overflowed the bottom lands on both sides. At low water it could be forded at almost any point ; but during high water it was above a fording stage, and could then be crossed only at the few points where bridges had been constructed. These bridges had all been destroyed by the enemy on our approach, and it was necessary not only to reconstruct these, but to build several others."], [102, "94 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLA.N. The west bank of the river opposite the New and Mechanicsville bridges was bordered by elevated bluffs, which afforded the enemy commanding positions to fortify, establish his batteries, enfilading the approaches upon the two principal roads to Richmond on our right, and resist the reconstruction of the important bridges. This obliged us to select other less exposed points for our crossings. As the enemy was not in great force opposite Bottom's bridge on the arrival of our left at that point, and as it was important to secure a lodgment upon the right bank before he should have time to concentrate his forces and contest the passage, I forthwith ordered Casey's division to ford the river and occupy the opposite heights. This was promptly done on the 20th, and reconnoissances were at once pushed out in advance. These troops were directed to throw up defences in an advantageous position to secure our left flank. General Heintzelman's corps was thrown forward in support, and Bottom's bridge immediately rebuilt. In the mean time our centre and right were advanced to the river above, and on the 24th we carried the village of Mechanicsville, driving the enemy out with our artillery, and forcing them across the bridge, which they destroyed. General Naglee on the same day dislodged a force of the enemy from the vicinity of the \"Seven Pines,\" on the Bottom's bridge road, and our advance on the left secured a strong position near that place. All the information obtained from deserters, negroes, and spies, indicated that the enemy occupied in force all the approaches to Richmond from the east, and that he intended to dispute every step of our advance beyond the Chickahominy, and the passage of the stream opposite our right. That their army was superior to ours in numbers, did not admit of a doubt. Strong defences had been con structed around Richmond. Impressed by these facts with the necessity of strengthening the army for the struggle, I did not fail to urge repeatedly upon my superiors the importance of re-enforcing the army of the Potomac with every disposable man, in order to insure the success of our attack upon the rebel capital. On the 10th of May I telegraphed as follows : \" Camp at Ewell's Farm, three miles bevond Williamsburg, \" May 10, 1862\u20145 a. m. \" From the information reaching me from every source, I regard it as certain that the enemy will meet us with all his force on or near the Chickahominy. They can concentrate many more men than I have, and are collecting troops from all quarters, especially well disciplined troops from the south. Casualties, sickness, garrisons, and guards have much reduced our numbers, and will con tinue to do so. I shall fight the rebel army with whatever force I may have, hut duty requires me to urge that every effort be made to re-enforce me without delay with all the disposable troops in Eastern Virginia, and that we concentrate all our forces, as far as possible, to fight the great battle now impending, and to make it decisive. \" It is possible that the enemy may abandon Richmond without a serious struggle ; but I do not believe he will, and it would be unwise to count upon anything but a stubborn and desperate defence \u2014 a life and death contest. I see no other hope for him than to fight this battle, and we must win it. I shall fight them whatever their force may be, but I ask for every man that the de partment can send me. No troops should now be left unemployed. Those who entertain the opinion that the rebels will abandon Richmond without a stru\u00b0-\u00b0-le, are, in my judgment, badly advised, and do not comprehend their situation', which is one requiring desperate measures. \"I beg that the President and Secretary will maturely weigh what I say, and leave nothing undone to comply with my request. If I am not re-enforced,' it is probable that I will be obliged to fight nearly double my numbers strongly"], [103, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 95 intrenched. I do not think it will be at all possible for me to bring more than (70,000) seventy thousand men upon the field of battle. \"GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding. \" Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, \" Secretary of War.\" On the 14th of May I sent the following telegram to the President: \"Camp at Cumberland, May 14, 1862. \" I have more than twice telegraphed to the Secretary of War, stating that, in my opinion, the enemy were concentrating all their available force to fight this army in front of Richmond, and that such ought to be their policy. I have received no reply whatever to any of these telegraphs. I beg leave to repeat their substance to your excellency, and to ask that kind consideration which you have ever accorded to my representations and views. All my information from every source accessible to me establishes the fixed purpose of the rebels to defend Richmond against this army by offering us battle with all the troops they can collect from east, west, and south, and my own opinion is confirmed by that of all my commanders whom I have been able to consult. '\u2022 Casualties, sickness, garrisons, and guards have much weakened my force, and will continue to do so. I cannot bring into actual battle against the enemy more than eighty thousand men at the utmost, and with them I must attack in position, probably intrenched, a much larger force, perhaps double my numbers. It is possible that Richmond may be abandoned without a serious struggle; but the enemy are actually in great strength between here and there, and it would be unwise, and even insane, for me to calculate upon anything but a stubborn and desperate resistance. If they should abandon Richmond, it may well be that it is done with the purpose of making the stand at some place in Virginia south or west of there, and we should be in condition to press them without delay. The confederate leaders must employ their utmost efforts against this army in Virginia, and they will be supported by the whole body of their military officers, among whom there may be said to be no Union feeling, as there is also very little among the higher class of citizens in the seceding States. \" I have found no fighting men left in this Peninsula. All are in the ranks of the opposing foe. \"Even if more troops than I now have should prove unnecessary for purposes of military occupation, our greatest display of imposing force in the capital of the rebel government will have the best moral effect. I most respectfully and earnestly urge upon your excellency that the opportunity has come for striking a fatal blow at the enemies of the Constitution, and I beg that you will cause this army to be re-enforced without delay by all the disposable troops of the gov- ernment. I ask for every man that the War Department can send me. Any commander of the re-enforcements whom your excellency may designate will be acceptable to me, whatever expression I may have heretofore addressed to you on that subject. \" I will fight the enemy whatever their force may be, with whatever force I may have ; and I firmly believe that we shall beat them, but our triumph should be made decisive and complete. The soldiers of this army love their govern- ernment, and will fight well in its support. You may rely upon them. They have confidence in me as their general, and in you as their President. Strong re-enforcements will at least save the lives of many of them. The greater our force the more perfect will be our combinations, and the less our loss. \"For obvious reasons I beg you to give immediate consideration to this com-"], [104, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B.

McCLELLAN, \" Major General. \"His Excellency Abraham Lincoln, \" President of the United States.\" To which, on the 18th of May, I received this reply: \"Washington, May 18 \u2014 2 p. m. \" General : Your despatch to the President, asking re-enforcements, has been received and carefully considered. \" The President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely; and it is be lieved that even if this were prudent, it would require more time to effect a junction between your army and that of the Rappahannock by the way of the Potomac and York river, than by a land march. In order, therefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the earliest moment, General McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route. He is ordered, keeping himself always in position to save the capital from all pos sible attack, so to operate as to put his left wing in communication with your right wing, and you are instructed to co-operate so as to establish this communi cation as soon as possible by extending your right wing to the north of Rich mond. \"It is believed that this communication can be safely established either north or south of the Pamunkey river. \"In any event, you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy's forces from leaving Richmond, and falling in overwhelming force upon General McDowell. He will move with between thirty-five (35) and forty thousand (40,000) men. \"A copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with this. The specific task assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the capital of the nation. \" At your earnest call for re-enforcements, he is sent forward to co-operate in the reduction of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not to uncover the city of Washington, and you will give no order, either before or after your junction, which can put him out of position to cover this city. You and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or otherwise, as frequently as may be necessary for sufficient co-operation. When General McDowell is in position on your right, his supplies must be drawn from West Point, and you will in struct your staff officers to be prepared to supply him by that route. \" The President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the department of the Rappahannock, and of the forces with which he moves for ward. \"By order of the President. \"EDWIN M. ST ANTON, \" Secretary of War. \"Major General George B. McClellan, \" Commanding Army of the Potomac, before Richmond.\" It will be observed that this order rendered it impossible for me to use the James river as a line of operations, and forced me to establish our depots on the Pamunkey, and to approach Richmond from the north. I had advised, and preferred, that re-enforcements should be sent by water, for the reasons that their arrival would be more safe and certain, and that I would be left free to rest the army on the James river whenever the navigation of that ttream should be opened."], [105, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 97 The land movement obliged me to expose my right in order to secure the junction; and as the order for General McDowell's march was soon counter manded, I incurred great risk, of which the enemy finally took advantage, and frustrated the plan of campaign. Had General McDowell joined me by water, I could have approached Richmond by the James, and thus avoided the delays and losses incurred in bridging the Chickahominy, and would have had the army massed in one body instead of being necessarily divided by that stream. The following is a copy of the instructions to General McDowell : \"War Department, Washington, May 17, 1862. \" General : Upon being joined by General Shields's division, you will move upon Richmond by the general route of the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad, co-operating with the forces under General McClellan, now threatening Richmond from the line of the Pamunkey and York rivers. \" While seeking to establish as soon as possible a communication between your left wing and the right wing of General McClellan, you will hold your self always in such position as to cover the capital of the nation against a sud den dash of any large body of the rebel forces. \" General McClellan will be furnished with a copy of these instructions, and will be directed to hold himself in readiness to establish communication with your left wing, and to prevent the main body of the enemy's army from leaving Richmond, and throwing itself upon your column, before a junction of the two armies is effected. \"A copy of his instructions in regard to the employment of your force is annexed. \" By order of the President. \"EDWIN M. STANTON, \" Secretary of War. \"General McDowell, \" Commanding Department of Rappahannock.\" Having some doubts, from the wording of the foregoing orders, as to the ex tent of my authority over the troops of General McDowell, and as to the time when I might anticipate his arrival, on the 21st of May I sent this despatch: \"Headquarters Army- of the Potomac, \" Camp near Tunstall's Station, Virginia, May 21, 1862 \u2014 11 p. m. \" Your despatch of yesterday, respecting our situation and the batteries of Fort Darling, was received while I was absent with the advance, where I have been all this day. I have communicated personally with Captain Goldsborough, and by letter with Captain Smith. The vessels can do nothing without co-oper ation on land, which I will not be in condition to afford for several days. Cir cumstances must determine the propriety of a land attack. \" It rained again last night, and rain on this soil soon makes the roads in credibly bad for army transportation. I personally crossed the Chickahominy to-day at Bottom's bridge ford, and went a mile beyond, the enemy being about half a mile in front. I have three regiments on the either bank guarding the re-building of the bridge. Keyes's corps is on the New Kent road, near Bot tom's bridge. Heintzelman is on the same road, within supporting distance. Sumner is on the railroad, connecting right with left. Stoneman, with advanced guard, is within one mile of New bridge. Franklin, with two divisions, is about two miles this side of Stoneman. Porter's division, with the reserves of infantry and artillery, is within supporting distance. Headquarters will probably be at Coal Harbor to-morrow, one mile this side of Franklin. All the bridges over the Chickahominy are destroyed. The enemy are in force on every road lead H. Ex.

Their main body is on the road from New bridge, encamped along it for four or five miles, spreading over the open ground on both sides. Johnston's headquarters are about two miles beyond the bridge. \"All accounts report their numbers as greatly exceeding our own. The position of the rebel forces, the declaration of the confederate authorities, the resolutions of the Virginia legislature, the action of the city government, the conduct of the citizens, and all other sources of information accessible to me, give positive assurance that our approach to Richmond involves a desperate battle between the opposing armies. \" All our divisions are moving towards the foe. I shall advance steadily and carefully, and attack them according to my best judgment, and in such manner as to employ my greatest force. \" I regret the state of things as to General McDowell's command. We must beat the enemy in front of Richmond. One division added to this army for that effort would do more to protect Washington than his whole force can possibly do anywhere else in the field. The rebels are concentrating from all points for the two battles at Richmond and Corinth. I would still, most respectfully, sug gest the policy of our concentrating here by movements on water. I have heard nothing as to the probabilities of the contemplated junction of McDowell's force with mine. I have no idea when he can start, what are his means of transpor tation, or when he may be expected to reach this vicinity. I fear there is little hope that he can join me over land in time for the coming battle. Delays on my part will be dangerous. I si ar sickness and demoralization. This region is unhealthy for northern men, and unless kept moving, I fear that our soldiers may become discouraged. At present our numbers are weakening from disease, but our men remain in good heart. \" I regret also the configuration of the department of the Rappahannock. It includes a portion even of the city of Richmond. I think that my own depart ment should embrace the entire field of military operations designed for the cap ture and occupation of that city. \" Again, I agree with your excellency that one bad general is better than two good ones. \" I am not sure that I fully comprehend your orders of the 17th instant ad dressed to myself and General McDowell. If a junction is effected before we occupy Richmond, it must necessarily be east of the railroad to Fredericksburg and within my department. This fact, my superior rank, and the express lan guage of the 62d article of war, will place his command under my orders, unless it is otherwise specially directed by your excellency ; and I consider that he will be under my command, except that I am not to detach any portion of his forces, or give any orders which can put him out of position to cover Washington. If I err in my construction, I desire to be at once set right. Frankness compels me to say, anxious as I am for an increase of force, that the march of McDowell's column upon Richmond by the shortest route will, in my opinion, uncover Washington, as to any interposition by it, as completely as its movement by water. The enemy cannot advance by Fredericksburg on Washington. \" Should they attempt a movement, which to me seems utterly improbable, their route would be by Gordonsville and Manassas. I desire that the extent of my authority over McDowell may be clearly defined, lest misunderstandings and conflicting views may produce some of those injurious results which a di vided command has so often caused. I would respectfully suggest that this danger can only be surely guarded against by explicitly placing General Mc- Dowell under my orders in the ordinary way, and holding me strictly responsi ble for the closest observance of your instructions. I hope, Mr. President, that it is not necessary for me to assure you that your instructions would be observed"], [107, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 99 in the utmost good faith, and that I have no personal feelings which could in fluence me to disregard them in any particular. \" I believe that there is a great struggle before this army, but I am neither dismayed nor discouraged. I wish to strengthen its force as much as I can, but in any event I shall fight it with all the skill, caution, and determination that I possess, and I trust that the result may either obtain for me the permaneut confidence of my government, or that it may close my career. \" GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding. \" His Excellency Abraham Lincoln, \" President of the United States.\" On the 24th I received the following reply : \" May 24, 1862.\u2014 (From Washington, 21th.) \"I left General McDowell's camp at dark last evening. Shields's command is there, but it is so worn that he cannot move before Monday morning, the twenty sixth, (26th.) We have so thinned our line to get troops for other places that it was broken yesterday at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one (I) regiment infantry, two (2) companies cavalry, putting General Banks in some peril. \" The enemy's forces, under General Anderson, now opposing General Mc- Dowell's advance, have, as their line of supply and retreat, the road to Richmond. \" If, in conjunction with McDowell's movement against Anderson, you could send a force from your right to cut off the enemy's supplies from Richmond, preserve the railroad bridges across the two (2) forks of the Pamunkey and in tercept the enemy's retreat, you will prevent the army now opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly fifteen thousand (15,000) men; and if you succeed in saving the bridges, you will secure a line of railroad for sup plies in addition to the one you now have. Can you not do this almost as well as not, while you are building the Chickahominy bridges 1 McDowell and Shields both say they can, and positively will, move Monday morning. I wish you to move cautiously and safe/y. \" You will have command of McDowell, after he joins you, precisely as you indicated in your long despatch to us of the twenty-first, (21st.) \"A. LINCOLN, President. \" Major General G. B. McClellan.\" This information that McDowell's corps would march for Fredericksburg on the following Monday, (the 26th,) and that he would be under my command, as indicated in my telegram of the 21st, was cheering news, and I now felt confident that we would on his arrival be sufficiently strong to overpower the large army confronting us. At a later hour on the same day I received the following : \"May 24, 1862. \u2014 (From Washington, 4 p. m.) \"In consequence of General Banks's critical position, I have been compelled to suspend General McDowell's movements to join you. The enemy are mak ing a desperate push upon Harper's Ferry, and we are trying to throw General Fremont's force, aud part of General McDowell's, in their rear. \"A. LINCOLN, President. \"Major General Geo. B. McClellan.\" From which it will be seen that I could not expect General McDowell to join me in time to participate in immediate operations in front of Richmond, aid on the same evening I replied to the President that I would make my calculations accordingly."], [108, "100 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. It then only remained for me to make the best use of the forces at my dis posal, and to avail myself of all artificial auxiliaries to compensate as much as possible for the inadequacy of men. I concurred fully with the President in the injunction contained in his telegram of the 24th, that it was necessary with my limited force to move \"cautiously and safely.\" In view of the peculiar char acter of the Chickahominy, and the liability of its bottom land to sudden inundation, it became necessary to construct between Bottom's bridge and Mechanicsville eleven (11) new bridges, all long and difficult, with extensive log- way approaches. The entire army could probably have been thrown across the Chickahominy immediately after our arrival, but this would have left no force on the left bank to guard our communications or to protect our right and rear. If the com munication with our supply depot had been cut by the enemy, with our army concentrated upon the right bank of the Chickahominy, and the stage of water as it was for many days after our arrival, the bridges carried away, and our means of transportation not furnishing a single day's supplies in advance, the troops must have gone without rations, and the animals without forage, and the army would have been paralyzed. It is true I might have abandoned my communications and pushed forward towards Richmond, trusting to the speedy defeat of the enemy and the conse quent fall of the city for a renewal of supplies ; but the approaches were fortified, and the town itself was surrounded with a strong line orMntrenchments, requiring a greater length of time to reduce than our troops could have dis pensed with rations. Under these circumstances, I decided to retain a portion of the army on the left bank of the river until our bridges were completed. It will be remembered that the order for the co-operation of General McDowell was simply suspended, not revoked, and therefore I was not at liberty to aban don the northern approach. A very dashing and successful reconnoissance was made near New bridge, on the 24th of May, by Lieutenant Bowen, topographical engineers, escorted by the 4th Michigan volunteers and a squadron of the United States cavalry, commanded, respectively, by Golonel Woodbury and Captain Gordon. Our troops encountered a Louisiana regiment, and with little loss drove it back upon its brigade, killing a large number and capturing several prisoners. Great credit is due to the staff officers, as well as to Colonel Woodbury, Cap tain Gordon, and their commands, for their conduct on this occasion. _ The work upon the bridges was commenced at once, and pushed forward with great vigor ; but the rains, which from day to day continued to fall, flooded the valley, and raised the water to a greater height than had been known far twenty years. This demolished a great amount of our labor, and our first bridges, with their approaches, which were not made with reference to such extreme high water, were carried off or rendered impassable. We were obliged, with immense labor, to construct others, much longer, more elevated, and stable; our men worked in the water, exposed to the enemy's fire from the opposite bank. On the 25th of May I received the following telegram. \"Washington, May 25, 1862. \"Your despatch received. General Banks was at Sharpsburg with about six thousand (6,000) men, Shields having been taken from him to swell a column for McDowell to aid you at Richmond, and the rest of his force scattered at va rious places. Ou the twenty- third (23d) a rebel force of seven (7) to ten thousand (10,000) fell upon one regiment and two companies guarding the bridge at Port Royal, destroying it entirely ; crossed the Shenandoah, and on the twenty-fourth, (24th,) yesterday, pushed on to get north of Banks on the"], [109, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B.

This morning a battle ensued between the two forces, in which General Banks was beaten back into full retreat towards Mar tinsburg, and probably is broken up into a total rout. Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, just now reports that Jackson is now near Front Royal with ten thousand (10,000) troops, following up and supporting, as I understand, the force now pursuing Banks. Also, that another force of ten thousand is near Or leans, following on in the same direction. Stripped bare, as we are here, I will do all we can to prevent them crossing the Potomac at Harper's Ferry or above. McDowell has about twenty thousand of his forces moving back to the vicinity of Port Royal; and Fremont, who was at Franklin, is moving to Harrisonburg ; both these movements intended to get in the enemy's rear. \" One more of McDowell's brigades is ordered through here to Harper's Ferry ; the rest of his forces remain for the present at Fredericksburg. We are sending such regiments and dribs from here and Baltimore as we can spare to Harper's Ferry, supplying their places in some sort, calling in militia from the adjacent States. We also have eighteen cannon on the road to Harper's Ferry, of which arm there is not a single one at that point. This is now our situation. \"If McDowell's force was now beyond our reach, we should be entirely help less. Apprehensions of something like this, and no unwillingness to sustain you, has always been my reason for withholding McDowell's forces from you. \" Please understand this, and do the best you can with the forces you have. \" A.

He is also threatening Leesburg, and Geary on the Manassas Gap railroad, from both north and south, in pre cisely what force we cannot tell.

I have no knowledge of Banks's position and force, nor what there is at Ma nassas; therefore cannot form a definite opinion as to the force against him. \"I have two corps across Chickahominy, within six miles of Richmond; the others on this side at other crossings within same distance, and ready to cross when bridges are completed. \"G.

M'CLELLAN. 103 On' the same day I received intelligence that a very considerable force of the enemy was in the vicinity of Hanover Court House, to the right and rear of our army, thus threatening our communications, and in a position either to re-enforce Jackson, or to impede McDowell's junction, should he finally move to unite with us. On the same clay I also received information from General McDowell, through the Secretary of War, that the enemy had fallen back from Fredericks burg towards Richmond, and that General McDowell's advance was eight miles south of the Rappahannock. It was thus imperative to dislodge or defeat this force, independently even of the wishes of the President, as expressed in his telegram of the 26th. I intrusted this task to Brigadier General Fitz-John Porter, commanding the fifth corps, with orders to move at daybreak on the 27th. Through a heavy rain, and over bad roads, that officer moved his command as follows : Brigadier General W. H. Emory led the advance, with the 5th and 6th regi ments United States cavalry and Benson's horse battery of the 2d United States artillery, taking the road from New bridge, via Mechanicsville, to Hanover Court House. General Morell's division, composed of the brigades of Martindale, Butter field and McQuade, with Berdan's regiment of sharpshooters, and three batteries, under Captain Charles Griffin, 5th United States artillery, followed on the same road. Colonel G. K. Warren, commanding a provisional brigade, composed of the 5th and 13th New York, the 1st Connecticut artillery, acting as infantry, the Gth Pennsylvania cavalry, and Weeden's Rhode Island battery, moved from his station at Old Church by a road running to Hanover Court House, parallel to the Pamunkey. After a fatiguing march of fourteen miles through the mud and rain, General Emory, at noon, reached a point about two miles from Hanover Court House where the road forks to Ashland, and found a portion of the enemy formed in line across the Hanover Court House road. General Emory had, before this, been joined by the 25th New York, (of Martindale's brigade,) and Berdan's sharpshooters ; these regiments were de ployed with a section of Benson's battery, and advanced slowly towards the enemy until re-enforced by General Butterfield with four regiments of his brig ade, when the enemy was charged and quickly routed, one of his guns being captured by the 17th New York, under Colonel Lansing, after having been disabled by the fire of Benson's battery. The firing here lasted about an hour. The cavalry and Benson's battery were immediately ordered in pursuit, fol lowed by Morell's infantry and artillery, with the exception of Martindale's brigade. Warren's brigade having been delayed by repairing bridges, &c, now arrived, too late to participate in this affair ; a portion of this command was sent to the Pamunkey to destroy bridges, and captured quite a number of prisoners ; the remainder followed Morell's division. In the mean time Gen eral Martindale, with the few remaining regiments of his brigade and a section of artillery, advanced on the Ashlancl road, and found a force of the enemy's infantry, cavalry, and artillery, in position near Beake's station, on the Vir ginia Central railroad ; he soon forced them to retire towards Ashland. The 25th New York having been ordered to rejoin him, General Martindale was directed to form his brigade and move up the railroad to rejoin the rest of the command at Hanover Court House. He sent one regiment up the railroad, but remained with the 2d Maine, after wards joined by the 25th New York, to guard the rear of the main column. The enemy soon returned to attack General Martindale, who at once formed the 2d Maine, 25th New York, and a portion of the 44th New York, with one"], [112, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 104 section of Martin's battery, on the New bridge road, facing his own position of the morning, and then held his ground for an hour against large odds until re-enforced. General Porter was at Hanover Court House, near the head of his column, when he learned that the rear had been attacked by a large force. He at once faced the whole column about, recalled the cavalry sent in pursuit towards Ash land, moved the 13th and 14th New York and Griffin's battery direct to Martin dale's assistance, pushed the 9th Massachusetts and 62d Pennsylvania, of Mc- Quade's brigade, through the woods on the right, (our original left,) and attacked the flank of the enemy, while Butterfield, with the 83d Pennsylvania and 16th Michigan, hastened towards the scene of action by the railroad, and through the woods, further to the right, and completed the rout of the enemy. During the remainder of this aud the following day our cavalry was active in the pur suit, taking a number of prisoners. Captain Harrison, of the 5th United States cavalry, with a single company, brought in as prisoners two entire companies of infantry with their arms and ammunition. A part of Rush's lancers also captured an entire company with their arms. The immediate results of these affairs were, some two hundred of the enemy's dead buried by our troops, seven hundred and thirty prisoners sent to the rear, one 12-pound howitzer, one caisson, a large number of small arms, and two railroad trains, captured. Our loss amounted to 53 killed, 344 wounded and missing. The force encountered and defeated was General Branch's division, of North Carolina and Georgia troops, supposed to have been some 9,000 strong. Their camp at Hanover Court House was taken aud destroyed. Having reason to believe that General Anderson, with a strong force, was still at Ashland, I ordered General Syke's division of regulars to move on the 28th from New bridge toward Hanover Court House, to be in position to support General Porter. They reached a point within three miles of Hanover Court House, and remained there until the evening of the 29th, when they returned to their original camp. On the 28th General Stoneman's command of cavalry, horse artillery, and two regiments of infantry, were also placed under General Porter's orders. On the same day I visited Hanover Court House, whence I sent the follow ing despatch: \"Hanover Court House, \" May 28\u20142 p. m. \" Porter's action of yesterday was truly a glorious victory ; too much credit cannot be given to his magnificent division and its accomplished leader.

I will do my best to cut off Jackson, but am doubtful whether I can. \" It is the policy and duty of the government to send me by water all the well-drilled troops available. I am confident that Washington is in no danger. Engines and cars in large numbers have been sent up to bring down Jackson's command. '\u2022 I may not be able to cut them off, but will try ; we have cut all but the Fredericksburg and Richmond railroad. The real issue is in the battle about to be fought in front of Richmond. All our available troops should be collected here, not raw regiments, but the well-drilled troops. It cannot be ignored that"], [113, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B.

Stanton, Secretary of War.\" Having ascertained the state of affairs, instructions were given for the opera tions of the following day. On the 28th a party under Major Williams, 6th United States cavalry, de stroyed the common road bridges over the Pamunkey, and Virginia Central railroad bridge over the South Ann. On the 29th he destroyed the Fredericksburg and Richmond railroad bridge over the South Ann, and the turnpike bridge over the same stream. On the same day, and mainly to cover the movement of Major Williams, General Emory moved a column of cavalry towards Ashland, from Hanover Court House. The advance of this column under Captain Chambliss, 5th United States cavalry, entered Ashland, driving out a party of the enemy, destroyed the railroad bridge over Stony creek, and broke up the railroad and telegraph. Another column of all arms, under Colonel Warren, was sent on the same day by the direct road to Ashland, and entered it shortly after General Emory's column had retired, capturing a small party there. General Stoneman on the same day moved on Ashland by Leach's station, covering well the movements of the other columns. The objects of the expedition having been accomplished, and it being certain that the 1st corps would not join us at once, General Porter withdrew his com mand to their camps with the main army on the evening of the 29th. On the night of the 27th and 28th I sent the following despatch to the Secretary of War : \" Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Camp near New Bridge, May 28, 1862 \u2014 12.30 a. m. \"Porter has gained two complete victories over superior forces, yet I feel obliged to move in the morning with re-enforcements to secure the complete de struction of the rebels in that quarter. In doing so, I run some risk here, but I cannot help it. The enemy are even in greater force than I had supposed. I will do all that quick movements can accomplish, but you must send me all the troops you can, and leave to me full latitude as to choice of commanders. It is absolutely necessary to destroy the rebels near Hanover Court House before I can advance. \"G. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General. \" Hon. E. M.

The scrap of the Virginia Central, from Richmond to Hanover Junction, without more, is simply nothing.

General Anderson and his command passed Ashland yesterday evening en route for Richmond, leaving men behind to destroy bridges over the telegraph road which they travelled. This informa tion is reliable. It is also positively certain that Branch's command was from Gordonsville, bound for Richmond, whither they have now gone. \" It may be regarded as positive, I think, that there is no rebel force between Fredericksburg and Junction. \"G.

Porter has returned, and my army is again well in hand. Another day will make the probable field of battle passable for artillery.

McCLELLAN, \" Major General. \"Hon. E. M. Stanton, \" Secretary of War.\" The results of this brilliant operation of General Porter were the dispersal of General Branch's division, and the clearing of our right flank and rear. It was rendered impossible for the enemy to communicate by rail with Fredericksburg, or with Jackson via Gordonsville, except by the very circuitous route of Lynch- burg, and the road was left entirely open for the advance of McDowell had he been permitted to join the army of the Potomac. His withdrawal towards Front Royal was, in my judgment, a serious and fatal error; he could do no good in that direction, while, had he been permitted to carry out the orders of May 17, the united forces would have driven the enemy within the immediate intrench- ments of Richmond before Jackson could have returned to its succor, and prob- ably would have gained possession promptly of that place. I respectfully refer to the reports of General Porter and his subordinate commanders for the names of the officers who deserve especial mention for the parts they took in these affairs, but I cannot omit here my testimony to the energy and ability here displayed by General Porter on this occasion, since to him is mainly due the successes there gained. On the 20th of May a reconnoissance was ordered on the south side of the Chickahominy towards James river. This was accomplished by Brigadier Gen- eral H. M. Naglee, who crossed his brigade near Bottom's bridge, and pushed forward to within two miles of James river without serious resistance, or find- ing the enemy in force. The rest of the 4th corps, commanded by General E. D. Keyes, crossed the Chickahominy on the 23d of May. On the 24th, 25th, and 26th, a very gallant reconnoissance was pushed by General Naglee, with his brigade, beyond the Seven Pines, and on the 25th the 4th corps was ordered to take up and fortify a position in the vicinity of the Seven Pines. The order was at once obeyed; a strong line of rifle-pits opened, and an abatis constructed a little in the rear of the point where the nine-mile road comes into the Williamsburg road. On the same day General Heintzelman was ordered to cross with his corps, (the 3d,) and take a position two miles in advance of Bottom's bridge, watch ing the crossing of White Oak swamp, and covering the left and the rear of the left wing of the army. Being the senior officer on that side of the river, he was placed in command of both corps, and ordered to hold the Seven Pines at all hazards, but not to withdraw the troops from the crossings of White Oak swamp unless in an emergency. On the 28th General Keyes was ordered to advance Casey's division to Fair Oaks, on the Williamsburg road, some three-quarters of a mile in front of the Seven Pines, leaving General Couch's division at the line of rifle-pits. A new line of rifle-pits and a small redoubt for six field guns were commenced, and much of the timber in front of this line was felled on the two days following. The picket line was established, reaching from the Chickahominy to White Oak swamp. On the 30th General Heintzelman, representing that the advance had met"], [116, "108 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. with sharp opposition in taking up their position, and that he considered the point a critical one, requested and obtained authority to make such dispositions of his troops as he saw fit to meet the emergency. He immediately advanced two brigades of Kearney's division about the fourth of a mile in front of Savage's station, thus placing them within supporting distance of Casey's divi sion, which held the advance of the 4th corps. On the 30th the troops on the south side of the Chickahominy were in posi tion as follows : Casey's division on the right of the Williamsburg road, at right angles to it, the centre at Fair Oaks ; Couch's division at the Seven Pines ; Kearney's division on the railroad, from near Savage's station towards the bridge ; Hooker's division on the borders of White Oak swamp. Constant skirmishing had been kept up between our pickets and those of the enemy; while these lines were being taken up and strengthened, large bodies of confederate troops were seen immediately to the front and right of Casey's position. During the day and night of the 30th of May a very violent storm occurred. The rain falling in torrents rendered work on the rifle-pits and bridges impracti cable, made the roads almost impassable, and threatened the destruction of the bridges over the Chickahominy. The enemy perceiving the unfavorable position in which we were placed, and the possibility of destroying that part of our army which was apparently cut off from the main body by the rapidly rising stream, threw an overwhelming force (grand divisions of Generals D. H. Hill, Huger, Longstreet, and G. W. Smith) upon the position occupied by Casey's division. It appears from the official reports of General Keyes and his subordinate commanders that at ten o'clock a. m. on the 31st of May an aide-de-camp of General J. E. Johnston was captured by General Naglee's pickets. But little information as to the movements of the enemy was obtained from him, but his presence so near our lines excited suspicion and caused increased vigilance, and the troops were ordered by General Keyes to be under arms at eleven o'clock. Between eleven and twelve o'clock it was reported to General Casey that the enemy were approaching in considerable force on the Williamsburg road. At this time Casey's division was disposed as follows : Naglee's brigade extend ing from the Williamsburg road to the Garnett field, having one regiment across the railroad ; General Wessel's brigade in the rifle-pits, and General Palmer's in the rear of General Wessel's ; one battery of artillery in advance with General Naglee; one battery in rear of rifle-pits to the right of the redoubt; one battery in rear of the redoubt, and another battery unharnessed in the re doubt. General Couch's division, holding the second line, had General Aber crombie's brigade on the right, along the nine-mile road, with two regiments and one battery across the railroad near Fair Oaks station; General Peck's brigade on the right, and General Devens's in the centre. On the approach of the enemy, General Casey sent forward one of General Palmer's regiments to support the picket line, but this regiment gave way with out making much, if any, resistance. Heavy firing at once commenced, and the pickets were driven in. General Keyes ordered General Couch to move General Peck's brigade to occupy the ground on the left of the Williamsburg road, which had not before been occupied by our forces, and thus to support General Casey's left, where the first attack was the most severe. The enemy now came on in heavy force, attacking General Casey simultaneously in front and on both flanks. General Keyes sent to General Heintzelman for re-enforcements, but the messen ger was delayed, so that orders were not sent to Generals Kearney and Hooker until nearly 3 o'clock, and it was nearly 5 p. m. when Generals Jameson and Perry's brigades of General Kearney's division arrived on the field. General Birney was ordered up the railroad, but by General Kearney's order halted his brigade before arriving at the scene of action. Orders were also despatched for"], [117, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 109 General Hooker to move up from White Oak swamp, and he arrived after dark at Savage's station. As soon as the firing was heard at headquarters, orders were sent to General Sumner to get his command under arms and be ready to move at a moment's warning. His corps, consisting of Generals Richardson's and Sedgwick's divisions, was encamped on the north side of the Chickahominy, some six miles above Bottom's bridge; each division had thrown a bridge over the stream op posite to its own position. At one o'clock General Sumner moved the two divisions to their respective bridges, with instructions to halt and await further orders. At two o'clock orders were sent from headquarters to cross these divisions without delay, and push them rapidly to General Heintzelman's support. This order was received and communicated at half past two, and the passage was immediately com menced. In the mean time General Naglee's brigade, with the batteries of Gen eral Casey's division, which General Naglee directed, Struggled gallantly to maintain the redoubt and rifle-pits against the overwhelming masses of the enemy. They were re-enforced by a regiment from General Peck's brigade. The artillery under command of Colonel G. D. Bailey, 1st New York artillery, and afterwards of General Naglee, did good execution on the advancing column. The left of this position was, however, soon turned, and a sharp cross-fire opened upon the gunners and men in the rifle-pits. Colonel Bailey, Major Van Val kenberg, and Adjutant Ramsey, of the same regiment, were killed; some of the guns in the redoubt were taken, and the whole line was driven back upon the position occupied by General Couch. The brigades of Generals Wessel and Palmer, with the re-enforcements which had been sent them from General Couch, had also been driven from the field with heavy loss, and the whole position oc cupied by General Casey's division was taken by the enemy. Previous to this time General Keyes ordered General Couch to advance two regiments to relieve the pressure upon General Casey's right flank. In making this movement, General Couch discovered large masses of the enemy pushing towards our right, and crossing the railroad, as well as a heavy column which had been held in reserve, and which was now making its way towards Fair Oaks station. General Couch at once engaged this column with two regiments; but, though re-enforced by two additional regiments, he was overpowered, aud the enemy pushed between him and the main, body of his division. With these four regiments and one battery General Couch fell back about half a mile towards the Grapevine bridge, where, hearing that General Sumner had crossed, he formed line of battle facing Fair Oaks station, and prepared to hold the position. Generals Berry and Jameson's brigades had by this time arrived in front of the Seven Pines. General Berry was ordered to take possession of the woods on the left, and push forward so as to have a flank fire on the enemy's lines. This movement was executed brilliantly, General Berry pushing his regiments forward through the woods until their rifles commanded the left of the camp and works occupied by General Casey's division in the morning. Their fire on the pursuing columns of the enemy was very destructive, and assisted materially in checking the pursuit in that part of the field. He held his position in these woods against several attacks of superior numbers, and after dark, being cut off by the enemy from the main body, he fell back towards White Oak swamp, and by a circuit brought his men into our lines in good order. General Jameson, with two regiments, (the other two of his brigade having been detached \u2014 one to General Peck and one to General Birney,) moved rapidly to the front on the left of the Williamsburg road, and succeeded for a time in keeping the abatis clear of the enemy. But large numbers of the enemy press ing past .he right of his line, he, too, was forced to retreat through the woods towards White Oak swamp, and in that way gained camp under cover of night. Brigadier General Devens, who had held the centre of General Couch's"], [118, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 110 division, had made repeated and gallant efforts to regain portions of the ground lost in front, but each time was driven back, and finally withdrew behind the rifle-pits near Seven Pines. Meantime General Sumner had arrived with the advance of his corps, Gen eral Sedgwick's division, at the point held by General Couch with four regi ments and one battery. The roads leading from the bridge were so miry that it was only by the greatest exertion General Sedgwick had been able to get one of his batteries to the front. The leading regiment (1st Minnesota, Colonel Sully) was immediately de- ployed to the right of Couch, to protect the flank, and the rest of the division formed in line of battle, Kirby's battery near the centre, in an angle of the woods. One of General Couch's regiments was sent to open communication with General Heintzelman. No sooner were these dispositions made than the enemy came in strong force and opened a heavy fire along the line. He made several charges, but was each time repulsed with great loss by the steady fire of the infantry and the splendid practice of the battery. After sustaining the enemy's fire for a considerable time, General Sumner ordered five regiments (the 34th New York, Colonel Sinter; 82d New York, Lieutenant Colonel Hudson; 15th Massachusetts, Lieutenant Colonel Kimball; 20th Massachusetts, Colonel Lee; 7th Michigan, Major Richardson \u2014 the three former of General Gorman's brigade, the two latter of General Dana's brigade) to advance and charge with the bayonet. This charge was executed in the most brilliant manner. Our troops springing over two fences which were between them and the enemy, rushed upon his lines, and drove him in confusion from that part of the field. Darkness now ended the battle for that day. During the night dispositions were made for its early renewal. General Couch's division, and so much of General Casey's as could be collected together, with General Kearney's, occupied the rifle-pits near Seven Pines. General Peek, in falling back on the left, had succeeded late in the afternoon in rallying a considerable number of stragglers, and was taking them once more into the action, when he was ordered back to the intrenched camp by General Kearney. Gen- eral Hooker brought up his division about dark, having been delayed by the heaviness of the roads and the throng of fugitives from the field, through whom the colonel of the leading regiment (Starr) reports he \"was obliged to force his way with the bayonet.\" This division bivouacked for the night in rear of the right of the rifle-pits, on the other side of the railroad. General Richardson's division also came upon the field about sunset. He had attempted the passage of the Chickahominy by the bridge opposite his own camp, but it was so far destioyed that he was forced to move Generals Howard and Meagher's brigades, with all his artillery, around by General Sedgwick's bridge, while General French's brigade, with the utmost difficulty, crossed by the other. General Sedgwick's division, with the regiments under General Couch, held about the same position as when the fight ceased, and General Richardson on his arrival was ordered to place his division on the left to connect with General Kearney ; General French's brigade was posted along the railroad, and Generals Howard and Meagher's brigades in second and third lines. All his artillery had been left behind, it being impossible' to move it forward through the deep mud as rapidly as the infantry pushed towards the field, but during the night the three batteries of the division were brought to the front. About five o'clock on the morning of the first of June skirmishers and some cavalry of the enemy were discovered in front of General Richardson's division. Captain Pettit's battery, (B, 1st New York.) having come upon the ground, threw a few shells among them, when they dispersed. There was a wide interval be tween General Richardson and General Kearney. To close this, General Rich ardson's line was extended to the left and his first line moved over the railroad. Scarcely had they gained the position, when the enemy appearing in large force"], [119, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 111 from the woods in front, opened a heavy fire of musketry at short range along the whole line. He approached very rapidly with columns of attack formed on two roads which crossed the railroad. These columns were supported by infantry in line of battle on each side, cutting General French's line. He threw out no skirmishers, but appeared determined to carry all before him by one crushing blow. For nearly an hour the first line of General Richardson's division stood and returned the fire, the lines of the enemy being re-enforced and relieved time after time, till finally General Howard was ordered with his brigade to go to General French's assistance. He led his men gallantly to the front, and in a few minutes the fire of the enemy ceased and his whole line fell back on that part of the field. On the opening of the firing in the morning General Hooker pushed forward on the railroad with two regiments (5th and 6th New Jersey,) followed by General Sickles's brigade. It was found impossible to move the artillery of this division from its position on account of the mud. On coming near the woods, which were held by the enemy in force, General Hooker found General Birney's brigade, Colonel J. Hobart Ward in command, in line of battle. He sent back to hasten General Sickles's brigade, but ascertained that it had been turned off to the left by General Heintzelman to meet a column advancing in that direction. He at once made the attack with the two New Jersey regiments, calling upon Colonel Ward to support him with General Birney's brigade. This was well done, our troops advancing into the woods under a heavy fire, and pushing the enemy before them for more than an hour of hard fighting. A charge with the bayonet was then ordered by General Hooker with the 5th and 6th New Jersey, 3d Maine, and 38th and 40th New York, and the enemy fled in confusion, throwing down arras and even clothing in his flight. General Sickles, having been ordered to the left, formed line of battle on both sides of the Williamsburg road and ad- vanced under a sharp fire from the enemy, deployed in the woods in front of him ; after a brisk interchange of musketry fire while crossing the open ground, the Excelsior brigade dashed into the timber with the bayonet and put the enemy to flight. On the right the enemy opened fire after half an hour's cessation, which was promptly responded to by General Richardson's division. Again the most vig- orous efforts were made to break our line, and again they were frustrated by the steady courage of our troops. In about an hour General Richardson's whole line advanced, pouring in their fire at close range, which threw the line of the enemy back in some confusion. This was followed up by a bayonet charge led by General French in person, with the 57th and 66th New York, supported by two regiments sent by General Heintzelman, the 71st and 73d New York, which turned the confusion of the enemy into precipitated flight. One gun captured the previous day was retaken. Our troops pushed forward as far as the lines held by them on the 31st before the attack. On the battle-field there were found many of our own and the con- federate wounded, arms, caissons, wagons, subsistence stores, and forage, aban- doned by the enemy in his rout. The state of the roads and impossibility of manoeuvring artillery prevented further pursuit. On the next morning a reconnoissance was sent forward, which pressed back the pickets of the enemy to within five miles of Richmond ; but again the impossibility of forcing even a few batteries forward precluded our holding permanently this position. The lines held previous to the battle were therefore resumed. General J. E. John- ston reports loss of the enemy in Longstreet's and J. W. Smith's divisions at 4,283 ; General D. H. Hill, who had taken the advance in the attack, estimates his loss at 2,500 ; which would give the enemy's loss 6,783. Our loss was, in General Sumner's corps, 1,223; General Heiutzelman's corps, 1,394; General Keyes's corps, 3,120 \u2014 total, 5,737. Previous to the arrival of General Sumner upon the field of battle, on the 31st of May, General Heintzelman, the senior corps commander present, was in"], [120, "112 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. the immediate command of the forces engaged. The first information I received that the battle was in progress was a despatch from him stating that Casey's division had given way. During the night of the 31st I received a despatch from him, dated 8.45 p. m., in which he says : \"lam just in. When I got to the front the most of General Casey's division had dispersed. The rout of General Casey's men had a most dispiriting effect on the troops as they came up. I saw no reason why we should have been driven back.\" This official statement, together with other accounts received previous to my arrival upon the battle-field, to the effect that Casey's division had given way without making a proper resistance, caused me to state, in a telegram to the Secretary of War on the first, that this division \" gave way unaccountably and discreditably.\" Subsequent investigations, however, greatly modified the im pressions first received, and I accordingly advised the Secretary of War of this in a despatch on the 5th of June. The official reports of Generals Keyes, Casey, and Naglee show that a very considerable portion of this division fought well, and that the brigade of Gen eral Naglee is entitled to credit for its gallantry. This division, among the reg iments of which were eight of comparatively new troops, was attacked by superior numbers ; yet, according to the reports alluded to, it stood the attack \"for three hours before it was re-enforced.\" A portion of the division was thrown into great confusion upon the first onslaught of the enemy; but the personal efforts of General Naglee, Colonel Bailey, and other officers, who boldly went to the front and encouraged the men by their presence and example, at this critical juncture, rallied a great part of the division, and thereby enabled it to act a prominent part in this severely contested battle. It therefore affords me great satisfaction to withdraw the expression contained in my first despatch, and 1 cordially give my indorsement to the conclusion of the division commander, \"that those parts of his command which behaved discreditably were exceptional cases.\" On the 31st, when the battle of Fair Oaks commenced, we had two of our bridges nearly completed ; but the rising waters flooded the log-way approaches and made them almost impassable, so that it was only by the greatest efforts that General Sumner crossed his corps and participated in that hard-fought en- gagement. The bridges became totally useless after this corps had passed, and others on a more permanent plan were commenced. On my way to headquarters, after the battle of Fair Oaks, I attempted to cross the- bridge where General Sumner had taken over his corps on the day previous. At the time General Sumner crossed this was the only available bridge above Bottom's bridge. I found the approach from the right bank for some 400 yards submerged to the depth of several feet, and on reaching the place where the bridge had been, I found a great part of it earned away, so that I could not get my horse over, and was obliged to send him to Bottom's bridge, six miles below, as the only practicable crossing. The approaches to New and Mechanicsville bridges were also overflowed, and both of them were enfiladed by the enemy's batteries established upon com manding heights on the opposite side. These batteries were supported by strong forces of the enemy, having numerous rifle-pits in their front, which would have made it necessary, even had the approaches been in the best possible condition, to have fought a sanguinary battle, with but little prospect of success, before a passage could have been secured. The only available means, therefore, of uniting our forces at Fair Oaks for an advance on Richmond soon after the battle, was to march the troops from Mechanicsville, and other points, on the left banks of the Chickahominy down to Bottom's bridge, and thence over the Williamsburg road to the position near Fair Oaks, a distance of about twenty-three (23) miles. In the condition of the roads at that time this march could not have been made with artillery in"], [121, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN 113 less than two days, by which time the enemy would have been secure within his intrenchments around Richmond. Iu short, the idea of uniting the two wings of the army in time to make a vigorous pursuit of the enemy, with the prospect of overtaking him before he reached Richmond, only five miles distant from the field of battle, is simply absurd, and was, I presume, never for a mo ment seriously entertained by any one connected with the army of the Potomac. An advance, involving the separation of the two wings by the impassable Chicka hominy, would have exposed each to defeat in detail. Therefore I held the position already gained, and completed our crossings as rapidly as possible. In the mean time the troops at Fair Oaks were directed to strengthen their positions by a strong line of intrenchments, which protected them .while the bridges were being built, gave security to the trains, liberated a larger fighting force, and offered a safer retreat in the event of disaster. On the 2d of June I sent the following despatch : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \"New Bridge, June 2, 1862\u201410.30 a. m. \" Our left is everywhere advanced considerably beyond the positions it oc cupied before the battle. I am in strong hopes that the Chickahominy will fall sufficiently to enable me to cross the right.

All that human labor can do is being done to accomplish our purpose. \"Please regard the portion of this relating to condition of Chickahominy as confidential, as it would be serious if the enemy were aware of it.

I have to be very cautious now. Our loss in the late battle will probably exceed (5,000) five thousand. I have not yet full returns. On account of the effect it might have on our own men and the enemy, I request that you will regard this information as confidential for a few days. I am satisfied that the loss of the enemy was very considerably greater ; they were terribly punished.

At last advice he contemplated sending a column to operate with Mitchell against Chattanooga, and thence upon East Tennessee. Buel reports Kentucky and Tennessee to be in a critical condition, demanding immediate attention. Halleck says the main body of Beauregard's force is with him at Okolona. McCall's force was reported yesterday as having embarked, and on its way to join you. It is intended to send the residue of McDowell's force also to join you as speedily as possible. \"Fremont had a hard fight, day before yesterday, with Jackson's force at Union church, eight miles from Harrisonburg. He claims the victory, but was pretty badly handled. It is clear that a strong force is operating with Jackson for the purpose of detaining the forces here from you. I am urging, as fast as possible, the new levies. \" Be assured, general, that there never has been a moment when my desire has been otherwise than to aid you with my whole heart, mind, and strength, since the hour we first met ; and whatever others may say for their own pur poses, you have never had, and never can have, any one more truly your friend, or more anxious to support you, or more joyful than I shall be at the success which I have no doubt will soon be achieved by your arms. \"EDWIN M. STANTON, \" Secretary of War. Major General G. B. McClellan.\" On the 12th and 13th General McCall's division arrived. On the 13th of June two squadrons of the 5th United States cavalry, under the command of Captain Royall, stationed near Hanover old church, were at tacked and overpowered by a force of the enemy's cavalry, numbering about fifteen hundred men, with four guns. They pushed on towards our depots, but at some distance from our main body, and, though pursued very cleverly, made the circuit of the army, repassing the Chickahominy at Long bridge. The burning of two schooners laden with forage, and fourteen government wagons, the destruction of some sutlers' stores, the killing of several of the guard and teamsters at Garlick's landing, some little damage done at TunstalPs station, and a little eclat, were the precise results of this expedition. On the 14th I sent the following to the Secretary of War : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Camp Lincoln, June 14, 1862 \u2014 midnight. \"All quiet in every direction. The stampede of last night has passed away. Weather now very favorable. I hope two days more will make the ground practi cable.

I do not feel that, in such circumstances as those in which I am now placed, General McDowell should wish the general interests to be sacrificed for the purpose of increasing his com mand. \"If I cannot fully control all his troops, I want none of them, but would pre fer to fight the battle with what I have, and let others be responsible for the results. \" The department lines should not be allowed to interfere with me; but Gen-"], [126, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B.

I therefore request that I may have entire and full control.

There is reason to believe that General R. S. Ripley has recently joined Lee's army, with a brigade or division from Charleston. Troops have arrived recently from Goldsboro'. There is not the slightest reason to suppose that the enemy intends evacuating Richmond; he is daily increasing his defences. I find him every where in force, and every reconnoissance costs many lives, yet I am obliged to feel my way, foot by foot, at whatever cost, so great are the difficulties of the country; by to-morrow night the defensive works, covering our position on this side of the Chickahominy, should be completed. I am forced to this by my in feriority in numbers, so that I may bring the greatest possible numbers into action, and secure the army against the consequences of unforeseen disaster. I would be glad to have permission to lay before your excellency, by letter or telegraph, my views as to the present state of military affairs throughout the whole country.

Under the circumstances, as stated in your despatch, I perceive that it will be better at least to defer, for the present, the communication I de sired to make. \"G. B. McCLELLAN, \"Major General, Commanding. \"His Excellency the President.\" All the information I could obtain, previous to the 24th of June, regarding the movements of General Jackson, led to the belief that he was at Gordons ville, where he was receiving re-enforcements from Richmond via Lynchburg and Staunton; but what his purposes were did not appear until the date specified, when a young man, very intelligent, but of suspicious appearance, wras brought in by our scouts from the direction of Hanover Court House He at first state d that he was an escaped prisoner, from Colonel Kenley's Maryland regi ment, captured at Front Royal, but finally confessed himself to be a deserter from Jackson's command, which he left near Gordonsville on the 21st. Jack son's troops were then, as he said, moving to Frederickshall, along the Virginia Central railroad, for the purpose of attacking my rear on the 28th. I imme diately despatched two trusty negroes to proceed along the railroad and ascer tain the truth of the statement. They were unable, however, to get beyond Hanover Court House, where they encountered the enemy's pickets, and were forced to turn back without obtaining the desired information. On that day I sent the following despatch : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \"June 24, 1862\u2014 12 p. m. \"A very peculiar case of desertion has just occurred from the enemy. The party states that he left Jackson, Whiting and Ewell, (fifteen brigades,) at Gor donsville on the 21st; that they were moving to Frederickshall, and that it was intended to attack my rear on the 2Sth. I would be glad to learn, at your earliest convenience, the most exact information you have as to the position and movements of Jackson, as well as the sources from which your information is derived, that I may the better compare it with what I have. \"G. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General.\" The following is his reply \"Washington, June 25, 1862. \"We have no definite information as to the numbers or position of Jackson's force. General King yesterday reported a deserter's statement that Jackson's force was, nine days ago, forty thousand men. Some reports place ten thousand rebels under Jackson, at Gordonsville; others, that his force is at Port Republic, Harrisonburg, and Luray. Fremont yesterday reported rumors that Western Virginia was threatened ; and General Kelly, that Ewell was advancing to New creek, where Fremont has his depots. The last telegram from Fremont con tradicts this rumor. The last telegram from Banks says the enemy's pickets are strong in advance at Luray ; the people decline to give any information of his whereabouts. Within the last two (2) days the evidence is strong that for some purpose the enemy is circulating rumors of Jackson's advance in various directions, with a view to conceal the real point of attack. Neither McDowell, who is at Manassas, nor Banks and Fremont, who are at Middletuwn, appear to have any accurate knowledge of the subject. A letter transmitted to the de-"], [128, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 120 partment yesterday, purported to be dated Gordonsville on the fourteenth (14th) instant, stated that the actual attack was designed for Washington and Balti more as soon as you attacked Richmond, but that the report was to be circu lated that Jackson had gone to Richmond, in order to mislead. This letter looked very much like a blind, and induces me to suspect that Jackson's real movement now is towards Richmond. It came from Alexandria, and is certainly designed, like the numerous rumors put afloat, to mislead. I think, therefore, that while the warning of the deserter to you may also be a blind, that it could not safely be disregarded. I will transmit to you any further information on this subject that may be received here. \"EDWIN M. STANTON, \"Secretary of War. \"Major General McClellan.\" On the 25th, our bridges and intrenchments being at last completed, an advance of our picket line of the left was ordered, preparatory to a general for ward movement. Immediately in front of the most advanced redoubt on the Williamsburg road was a large open field ; beyond that, a swampy belt of timber, some five hun dred yards wide, which had been disputed ground for many days. Further in advance was an open field, crossed by the Williamsburg road aud the railroad, and commanded by a redoubt and rifle-pits of the enemy. It was decided to push our lines to the other side of these woods, in order to enable us to ascertain the nature of the ground, and to place Generals Heintzel man and Sumner in position to support the attack intended to be made on the Old Tavern, on the 26th or 27th, by General Franklin, by assailing that posi tion in the rear. Between 8 and 9 o'clock, on the morning of the 25th, the advance was begun by General Heintzelman's corps. The enemy were found to be in strong force all along the line, and contested the advance stubbornly, but by sunset our object was accomplished. The troops engaged in this affair were the whole of Heintzelman's corps, Palmer's brigade of Couch's division of Keyes's corps, and a part of Richardson's division of Sumner's corps. For the details I refer to the report of General Heintzelman. The casualties (not including those in Palmer's brigade, which have not been reported) were as follows: officers killed, 1; wounded, 14; missing, 1; enlisted men killed, 50; wounded, 387; missing, 63; total, 516. The following telegrams were sent to the Secretary of War, during the day, from the field of operations : \"Redoubt No. 3, June 25, 1862 \u2014 1.30 -p. m. \"We have advanced our pickets on the left considerably, under sharp resist ance.

The rebel force is stated at two hundred thousand (200,000,) including Jackson and Beau regard. I shall have to contend against vastly superior odds if these reports be true. But this army will do all in the power of men to hold their position, and repulse any attack. \" I regret my great inferiority in numbers, but feel that I am in no way responsible for it, as I have not failed to represent repeatedly the necessity of re-enforcements, that this was the decisive point, and that all the available means of the government should be concentrated here. I will do all that a general can do with the splendid army I have the honor to command and, if it is destroyed by overwhelming numbers, can at least die with it and share its fate. But if the result of the action which will probably occur to-morrow, or within a short time, is a disaster, the responsibility cannot be thrown on my shoulders; it must rest where it belongs. \" Since I commenced this I have received additional intelligence confirming the supposition in regard to Jackson's movements and Beauregard's arrival. I shall probably be attacked to-morrow, and now go to the other side of the Chickahominy to arrange for the defence on that side. I feel that there is no use in again asking for re-enforcements. \"G.

The"], [130, "122 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. same report puts his numbers, on the 26th of June, at about ISO, 000, and the specific information obtained regarding their organization warrants the belief that this estimate did not exceed his actual strength. It will be observed that the evidence contained in the report shows the following organizations, viz : two hundred regiments of infantry and cavalry, including the forces of Jackson and Ewell, just arrived; eight battalions of independent troops ; five battalions of artillery; twelve companies of infantry and independent cavalry, besides fortyr-six companies of artillery; amounting, in all, to from forty to fifty brigades. There were undoubtedly many others whose designations we did not learn. The report also shows that numerous and heavy earthworks had been com pleted for the defence of Richmond, and that in thirty-six of these were mounted some two hundred guns. On the 26th, the day upon which I had decided as the time for our final ad vance, the enemy attacked our right in strong force, and turned my attention to the protection of our communications and depots of supply. The event was a bitter confirmation of the military judgment which had been reiterated to my superiors from the inception and through the progress of the Peninsula campaign. I notified the Secretary of War in the following despatch : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Camp Lincoln, June 26, 1862 \u2014 12 m. \" I have just heard that our advanced cavalry pickets on the left bank of Chicka hominy are being driven in. It is probably Jackson's advanced guard. If this be true, you may not hear from me for some days, as my communications will probably be cut off.

Do not believe reports of disaster, and do not be discouraged if you learn that my communications are cut off, and even Yorktown in possession of the enemy.

McClellan.\" But 5,000 of the re-enforcements spoken of in these communications came to the army of the Potomac, and these reached us at Harrison's bar, after the seven days. In anticipation of a speedy advance on Richmond, to provide for the contin- tingency of our communications with the depot at the White House being sev- ered by the enemy, and at the same time to be prepared for a change of the base of our operations to James river, if circumstances should render it advisable, I had made arrangements more than a week previous (on the 18th) to have transports with supplies of provisions and forage, under a convoy of gunboats, sent up James river. They reached Harrison's landing in time to be available for the army on its arrival at that point. Events soon proved this change of base to be, though most hazardous and difficult, the only prudent course. In order to relieve the troops of the 6th corps, on the 19th of June General Reynolds's and General Seymour's brigades, of General McCall's division, (Pennsylvania reserves,) were moved from Gaines's farm to a position on Beaver Dam creek, General Meade's brigade being held in reserve in frontof Gaines'sfarm. One regiment and a battery were thrown forward to the heights overlooking Mechanicsville, and a line of pickets extended along the Chickahominy river between the Mechanicsville and Meadow bridges. As has been already stated, I received, while engaged on the 25th in directing the operations of Heintzelman's corps, information which strengthened my suspicions that Jackson was advanc- ing with a large force upon our right and rear. On this day General Casey, at the White House, was instructed to prepare for a vigorous resistance, and de- fensive works were ordered at Tunstall's station. Early on the 25th General Porter was instructed to send out reconnoitring parties towards Hanover Court House to discover the position and force of the enemy, and to destroy the bridges on the Tolopotamoy as far as possible. Up to the 26th of June the operations against Richmond had been conducted along the roads leading to it from the east and northeast. The reasons (the President's anxiety about covering Washington from Fredericksburg, McDowell's promised co-operation, partial advance, and immediate withdrawal) which com- pelled the choice of this line of approach, and our continuance upon it, have been attended to above."], [132, "124 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. The superiority of the James river route, as a line of attack and supply, is too obvious to need exposition. My own opinion on that subject had been early given, and need not> be repeated here. The dissipation of all hope of the co operation by land of General McDowell's forces, deemed to be occupied in the defence of Washington, their inability to hold or defeat Jackson, disclosed an opportunity to the enemy, and a new danger to my right, and to the long line of supplies from the White House to the Chickahominy, and forced an imme diate change of base across the Peninsula. To that end, from the evening of the 26th, every energy of the army was bent. Such a change of base, in the presence of a powerful enemy, is one of the most difficult undertakings in war. I was confident of the valor and discipline of my brave army, and knew that it could be trusted equally to retreat or advance and to sight the series of battles now inevitable, whether retreating from victories or marching through defeats ; and, in short, I had no doubt whatever of its ability, even against superior numbers, to fight its way through to the James river, and get a position whence a successful advance upon Richmond would be again possible. Their superb conduct through the next seven days justified my faith. On the same day General Van Vliet, chief quartermaster of the army of the Potomac, by my orders, telegraphed to Colonel Ingalls, quartermaster at the White House, as follows: \"Run the cars to the last moment, and load them with provisions and ammunition. Load every wagon you have with subsistence, and send them to Savage's station, by way of Bottom's bridge. If you are obliged to abandon White House, burn everything that you cannot get off. You must throw all our supplies up the James river as soon as possible, and accom pany them yourself with all your force. It will be of vast importance to estab lish our depots on James river without delay if we abandon White House. I will keep you advised of every movement so long as the wires work; after that you must exercise your own judgment.\" All these commands were obeyed. So excellent were the dispositions of the different officers in command of the troops, depots, and gunboats, and so timely the warning of the approach of the enemy, that almost everything was saved, and but a small amount of stores destroyed to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy. General Stoneman's communications with the main army being cut off, he fell back upon the White House, and thence to Yorktown, when the White House was evacuated. On the 26th orders were sent to all the corps commanders on the right bank of the Chickahominy to be prepared to sen 1 as many troops as they could spare on the following day to the left bank of the river, as will be seen by the ap pended telegrams. General Franklin received instructions to hold General Slocum's division in readiness by daybreak of the 27th, and if heavy firing should at that time be heard in the direction of General Purser, to move at once to his assistance without further orders. At noon on the 26th the approach of the enemy, who had crossed above Meadow bridge, was disc vered by the advanced pickets at that point, and at 12.30 p. m. they were attacked and driven in. All the pickets were now called in, aud the regiment and battery at Mechanicsville withdrawn. Meade's brigade was ordered upas a reserve in rear of the line, aud shortly after Martindale's and Griffin's brigades, of Morell's division, were moved for ward and deployed on the right of McCall's division, towards Shady Grove church, to cover that flank. Neither of these three brigades, however, were warmly engaged, though two of Griffin's regiments relieved a portion of Rey ikiMs's line just at the close of the action The position of our troops was a strong one, extending along the left bank of Beaver Dam creek, the left resting on the Chickahominy, and the right in thick woods beyond the upper road from Mechanicsville to Coal Har-"], [133, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B M'CLELLAN. 125 bor. The lower or river road crossed the creek at Ellison's mills. Seymour's brigade held the left of the line from the Chickahominy to beyond the mill, partly in woods and partly in clear ground, and Reynolds's the right, princi pally in the woods and covering the upper road. The artillery occupied posi tions commanding the roads and the open ground across the creek. Timber had been felled, rifle-pits dug, and the position generally prepared with a care that greatly contributed to the success of the da)-. The passage of the creek was difficult along the whole front, and impracticable for artillery, ex cept by the two roads where the main efforts of the enemy were directed. At 3 p. m. he formed his line of battle, rapidly advanced his skirmishers, and soon attacked our whole line, making at the same time a determined attempt to force the passage of the upper road, which was successfully resisted by General Reynolds. After a severe struggle he was forced to retire with very heavy loss. A rapid artillery fire, with desultory skirmishing, was maintained along the whole front, while the enemy massed his troops for another effort at the lower road about two hours later, which was likewise repulsed by General Seymour with heavy slaughter. The firing ceased, and the enemy retired about 9 p. m., the action having lasted six hours, with entire success to our arms. But few, if any, of Jackson's troops were engaged on this day. The portion of the enemy encountered were chiefly from the troops ou the right bank of the river, who crossed near Meadow bridge and at Mechanicsville. The information in my possession soon after the close of this action convinced me that Jackson was really approaching in large force. The position on Beaver Dam creek, although so successfully defended, had its light flank too much in the air, and was too far from the main army to make it available to retain it longer. I therefore determined to send the heavy guns at Hogan's and Gaine3's houses over the Chickahominy during the night, with as many of the wagons of the 5th corps as possible, and to withdraw the corps itself to a position stretching around the bridges, where its flanks would be reasonably secure, and it would be within supporting distance of the main army. General Porter car ried out my orders to that effect. It was not advisable at that time, even had it been practicable, to withdraw the 5th corps to the right bank of the Chickahominy. Such a movement would have exposed the rear of the army, placed as between two fires, and enabled Jackson's fresh troops to interrupt the movement to James river, by crossing the Chickahominy in the vicinity of Jones's bridge before we could reach Mal vern hill with our trains. I determined then to resist Jackson with the 5th corps, re-enforced by all our disposable troops in the new position near the bridge heads, in order to cover the withdrawal of the trains and heavy guns, and to give time for the arrangements to secure the adoption of the James river as our line of supplies in lieu of the Pamunkey. The greater part of the heavy guns and wagons having been removed to the right bank of the Chickahominy, the delicate operation of withdrawing the troops from Beaver Dam creek was commenced shortly before daylight, and successfully executed. Meade's and Griffin's brigades were the first to leave the ground; Seymour's brigade covered the rear with the horse batteries of Captains Robertson and Tidball ; but the withdrawal was so skilful and gradual, and the repulse of the preceding day so complete, that although the enemy followed the retreat closelj', and some skirmishing occurred, he did not appear in front of the new line in force till about noon of the 27th, when we were prepared to receive him. About this time General Porter, believing that General Stoneman would be cut off from him, sent him orders to fall back on the White House, and after wards rejoin the army as best he could. On the morning of the 27th of June, during the withdrawal of his troops"], [134, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 126 from Mechanicsville to the selected position already mentioned, General Porter telegraphed as follows : \" I hope to do without aid, though I request that Franklin, or some other command, be held ready to re-enforce me. The enemy are so close that I expect to be hard pressed in front. I hope to have a portion in position to cover the retreat. This is a delicate movement, but relying on the good qualities of the commanders of divisions and brigades, I expect to get back and hold the new line. \" This shows how closely Porter's retreat was followed. Notwithstanding all the efforts used during the entire night to remove the heavy guns and wagons, some of the siege guns were still in position at Gaines's house after sunrise, and were finally hauled off by hand. The new position of the 5th corps was about an arc of a circle, covering the approaches to the bridges which connected our right wing with the troops on the opposite side of the river. Morell's division held the left of the line in a strip of woods on the left bank of the Gaines's mill stream, resting its left flank on the descent to the < hickahom iny, which was swept by our artillery on both sides of the river, and extending into open ground on the right towards New Coal Harbor. In this line General Butterfield's brigade held the extreme left, General Martindale's joined his right, and General Griffin, still further to the right, joined the left of General Sykes's division, which, partly in woods and partly in open ground, extended in the rear of Coal Harbor. Each brigade had in reserve two of its own regiments. McCall's division having been engaged on the day before, was formed in a second line in the rear of the first, Meade's brigade on the left near the Chickahominy, Reynolds's bri gade on the right, covering the approaches from Coal Harbor and Despatch station to Simmer's bridge, and Seymour's in reserve to the second line, still further in rear. General P. St. George Cooke, with five companies of the 5th regular cavalry, two squadrons of the 1st regular and three squadrons of the 6th Pennsylvania cavalry, (lancers,) was posted behind a hill in rear of the position, and near the Chickahominy, to aid in watching the left flank and de fending the slope to the river. The troops were all in position by noon, with the artillery on the commanding ground, and in the intervals between the divisions and brigades. Besides the division batteries, there were Robertson's and Tidball's horse batteries, from the artillery reserve ; the latter posted on the right of Sykes's division, and the former on the extreme left of the line, in the valley of the Chickahominy. Shortly after noon the enemy were discovered approaching in force, and it soon became evident that the entire. position was to be attacked. His skirmishers advanced rapidly, and soon the firing became heavy along our whole front. At 2 p. m., General Porter asked for re-enforcements. Slocum's division of the 6th corps was ordered to cross to the left bank of the river, by Alexander's bridge, and proceed to his support. General Porter's first call for reinforcements, through General Barnard, did not reach me, nor his demand for more axes, through the same officer. By 3 p. m. the engagement had become so severe, and the enemy were so greatly superior in numbers, that the entire second line and reserves had been moved forward to sustain the first line against repeated and desperate assaults along our whole front. At 3.30 p. m. Slocum's division reached the field and was immediately brought into action at the weak points of our line. On the left the contest was for the strip of woods running almost at right angles to the Chickahominy, in front of Adams's house, or between that and Gaines's house. The enemy several times charged up to this wood, but were"], [135, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B M'CLELLAN. 127 each time driven back with heavy loss. The regulars, of Sykes's division, on the right, also repulsed several strong attacks. But our own loss under the tremendous fire of such greatly superior numbers was very severe, and the tronps, most of whom had been under arms more than two days, were rapidly becoming exhausted by the masses of fresh men con stantly brought against them. When General Slocum's division arrived on the ground it increased General Porter's force to some 35,000, who were probably contending against about 70,000 of the enemy. The line was severely pressed in several points, and as its being pierced at any one would have been fatal, it was unavoidable for Gen eral Porter, who was required to hold his position until night, to divide Slo cum's division, and send parts of it, even single regiments, to the points most threatened. About 5 p. m., General Porter having reported his position as critical, French's and Meagher's brigades, of Richardson's division, (3d corps,) were ordered to cross to his support. The enemy attacked again in great force at 6 p. m., but failed to break our lines, though our loss was very heavy. About 7 p. m. they threw fresh troops against General Porter with still greater fury, and finally gained the woods held by our left. This reverse, aided by the confusion that followed an unsuccessful charge by five companies of the 5th cavalry, and followed as it was by more determined assaults on the remainder of our lines, now outftanked, caused a general retreat from our position so the hill in rear overlooking the bridge. French's and Meagher's brigades now appeared, driving before them the stragglers who were thronging towards the bridge. These brigades advanced boldly to the front, and by their example, as well as by the steadiness of their bearings, reanimated our own troops and warned the enemy that re- enforcements had arrived It was now dusk. The enemy, already repulsed several times with terrible slaughter, and hearing the shouts of the fresh troops, failed to follow up their advantage. This gave an oppor- tunity to rally our men behind the brigades of Generals French and Meagher, and they again advanced up the hill ready to repulse another attack. During the night our thin and exhausted regiments were all withdrawn in safety, and by the following morning all had reached the other side of the stream. The regular infantry formed the rear guard, and about 6 o'clock on the morning of the 2Sth crossed the river, destroying the bridge behind them. Our loss in this battle in killed, wounded, and missing, was very heavy, espe- cially in officers, many of whom were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners while gallantly leading on their men or rallying them to renewed exertions. It is impossible to arrive at the exact numbers lost in this desperate engage- ment, owing to the series of battles which followed each other in quick succes- sion, and in which the whole army was engaged. No general returns were made until after we had arrived at Harrison's landing, when the losses during the whole seven days were estimated together. Although we were finally forced from our first line after the enemy had been repeatedly driven back, yet the objects sought for had been obtained. The enemy was held at bay. Our siege guns and material were saved, and the right wing had now joined the main body of the army. The number of guns captured by the enemy at this battle was 22, three of which were lost by being run off the bridge during the final withdrawal. Great credit is due for the efficiency and bravery with which this important arm of the service (the artillery) was fought, and it was not until the last suc- cessful charge of the enemy that the cannoneers were driven from their pieces or struck down, and the guns captured. Deidrich's, Knierim's, and Grimm's batteries took position during the engagement in the front of General Smith's line on the right bank of the stream, aud with a battery of siege guns, served"], [136, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 128 by the 1st Connecticut artillery, helped to drive back the enemy in front of General Porter. So threatening were the movements of the enemy on both banks of the Chick ahominy, that it was impossible to decide until the afternoon where the real attack would be made. Large forces of infantry were seen during the day near the old tavern, on Franklin's right, and threatening demonstrations were fre quently made along the entire line on this side of the river, which rendered it necessary to hold a considerable force in position to meet them. On the 26th a circular was sent to the corps commanders, on the right bank of the river, asking them how many of their troops could be spared to re-enforce General Porter, after retaining sufficient to hold their positions for twenty -four hours. To this the following replies were received : \"Headquarters Third Corps, \"June 26 \u2014 4 p. m. \" 1 think I can hold the intrenchments with four brigades for twenty-four hours. That would leave two brigades disposable for service on the other side of the river, but the men are so tired and worn out that I fear they would not be in a condition to fight after making a march of any distance. * * \"S. P. HEINTZELMAN, \" Brigadier General. \" General R. B. Marcy.\" Telegrams from General Heintzelman, on the 25th and 26th, had indicated that the enemy was in large force in front of Generals Hooker and Kearney, and on the Charles City road, (Longstreet, Hill, and Huger,) and General Heintzelman expressed the opinion, on the night of the 25th, that he could not hold his advanced position without re-enforcements. General Keyes telegraphed : \"As to how many men will be able to hold this position for twenty--four hours, I must answer, all I have, if the enemy is as strong as ever in front, it having at all times appeared to me that our forces on this flank are small enough.\" On the morning of the 27th, the following despatch was sent to General Sumner : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" June 27 \u2014 8.45 a. m. \" General Smith just reports that six or eight regiments have moved down to the woods in front of General Sumner. \"R.

General Sumner telegraphed, as follows: \"The enemy threaten an attack on my right, near Smith.\" At 12.30 p. m. he telegraphed : \" Sharp shelling on both sides.\" At 2.45 p. m.: \"Sharp musketry firing in front of Burns; we are replying with artillery and infantry.

At 2 p. m. General Porter called for re-enforcements. I ordered them at once, and at 3.25 p. m. sent him the follow ing: \" Slocum is now crossing Alexander's bridge with his whole command; enemy has commenced an infantry attack on Smith's left; I have ordered down Sum ner's and Heintzelman's reserves, and you can count on the whole of Slocum's. Go on as you have begun.\" During the day the following despatches were received, which will show the condition of affairs on the right bank of the Chickahominy : \"June 27, 1862. \"General Smith thinks the enemy are massing heavy columns in the clearings to the right of James Garnett's house, and on the other side of the river oppo site it. Three regiments are reported to be moving from Sumner's to Smith's front. The arrangements are very good, made by Smith. \"W. B. FRANKLIN, \" Brigadier General. \"Colonel A. V. Colburn, \" Assistant Adjutant General.\" Afterwards he telegraphed : \" The enemy has begun an attack on Smith's left with infantry. I know no details.\" Afterwards the following: \"The enemy has opened on Smith from a battery of three pieces to the right of the White House. Our shells are bursting well, and Smith thinks Sumner will soon have a cross fire upon them that will silence them.\" Afterwards (at 5.50 p. m.) the following was sent to General Keyes \"Please send one brigade of Couch's division to these headquarters, without a momeut's delay. A staff officer will be here to direct the brigade where to go.\" Subsequently the following was sent to Generals Sumner and Franklin : \" Is there any sign of the enemy being in ferce in your front? Can you spare any more force to be sent to General Porter ? Answer at once.\" At 5.15 p. m. the following was received from General Franklin : \"I do not think it prudent to take any more troops from here at present.\" General Sumner replied as follows i \" If the general desires to trust the defence of my position to ray front line alone, I can send French with three regiments, and Meagher with his brigade, to the right ; everything is so uncertain, that I think it would be hazardous to do it.\" These two brigades were sent to re-enforce General Porter, as has been ob served. H. Ex. Doc. 15 9"], [138, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 130 At 5.25 p. m. I sent the following to General Franklin: \" Porter is hard pressed ; it is not a question of prudence, but of possibilities. Can you possibly maintain your position until dark with two brigades ? I have ordered eight regiments of Sumner's to support Porter ; one brigade of Couch's to this place. \"Heintzelman's reserve to go in rear of Sumner. If possible, send a brigade to support Porter. It should follow the regiments ordered from Sumner.\" At 7.35 p. m. the following was sent to General Sumner-: \" If it is possible, send another brigade to re-enforce General Smith; it is said three heavy columns of infantry are moving on him.\" From the foregoing despatches it will be seen that all disposable troops were sent from the right bank of the river to re-enforce General Porter, and that the corps commanders were left with smaller forces to hold their positions than they deemed adequate. To have done more, even though Porter's reverse had been prevented, would have had the still more disastrous result of imperilling the whole movement across the Peninsula. The operations of this day proved the numerical superiority of the enemy, and made it evident that while he had a large army on the left bank of the Chickahominy, which had already turned our right, and was in position to intercept the communications with our depot at the White House, he was also in large force between our army and Richmond ; I therefore effected a junction of our forces. This might probably have been executed on either side of the Chickahominy; and if the concentration had been effected on the left bank, it is possible we might, with our entire force, have defeated the enemy there ; but at that time they held the roads leading to the White House, so that it would have been impossible to have sent forward supply trains in advance of the army in that direction, and the guarding of those trains would have seriously embarrassed our operations in the battle ; we would have been compelled to fight, if concen trated on that bank of the river. Moreover, we would at once have been fol lowed by the enemy's forces upon the Richmond side of the river operating upon our rear; and if, in the chances of war, we had been ourselves defeated in the effort, we would have been forced to fall back to the White House, and probably to Fort Monroe ; and, as both our flanks and rear would then have been entirely exposed, our entire supply train, if not the greater part of the army itself, might have been lost. The movements of the enemy showed that they expected this, and, as they themselves acknowledged, they were prepared to cut off our retreat in that direction. I therefore concentrated all our forces on the right bank of the river. During the night of the 26th and morning of the 27th, all our wagons, heavy guns, &c, were gathered there. It may be asked, why, after the concentration of our forces on the right bank of the Chickahominy, with a large part of the enemy drawn away from Richmond upon the opposite side, I did not, instead of striking for James river, fifteen miles below that place, at once march directly on Richmond. It will he remembered that at this juncture the enemy was on our rear, and there was every reason to believe that he woidd sever our communications with the supply depot at the White House. We had on hand but a limited amount of rations, and if we had advanced directly on Richmond, it would have required considerable time to carry the strong works around that place, during which our men would have been desti tute of food ; and even if Richmond had fallen before our arms, the enemy could still have occupied our supply communications between that place and"], [139, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 131 the gunboats, and turned the disaster into victory. If, on the other hand, the enemy had concentrated all his forces at Richmond during the progress of our attack, and we had been defeated, we must in all probability have lost our trains before reaching the flotilla. The. battles which continued day after day in the progress of our flank move ment to the James river, with the exception of the one at Gaines's mill, were successes to our arms, and the closing engagement at Malvern hill was the most decisive of all. On the evening of the 27th of June I assembled the corps commanders at my headquarters, and informed them of my plan, its reasons, and my choice of route and method of execution. General Keyes was directed to move his corps, with its artillery and baggage, across the White Oak swamp bridge, and to seize strong positions oil the opposite side of the swamp, to cover the passage of the other troops and trains. This was executed on the 28th by noon. Before daybreak on the 28th I went to Savage's station, and remained there during the day and night, direct ing the withdrawal of the trains and supplies of the army. Orders were given to the different commanders to load their wagons with ammunition and provisions, and the neeessary baggage of the officers and men, and to destroy all property which could not be transported with the army. Orders were also given to leave with those of the sick and wounded who could not be transported, a proper complement of surgeons and attendants, with a bountiful supply of rations and medical stores. The large herd of 2,500 beef-cattle was, by the chief commissary, Colonel Clarke, transferred to the James river without loss. On the morning of the 28th, while General Franklin was withdrawing his command from Golding's farm, the enemy opened upon General Smith's divis ion from Garnett's hill, from the valley above, and from Gaines's hill on the opposite side of the Chickahominy; aud shortly afterwards two Georgia regi ments attempted to carry the works about to be vacated, but this attack was repulsed by the 23d New York and the 49th Pennsylvania volunteers on picket, and a section of Mott's battery. Porter's corps was moved across White Oak swamp during the day and night, and took up positions covering the roads leading from Richmond towards White Oak swamp and Long bridge. McCall's division was ordered, on the night of the 28th, to move across the swamp and take a proper positiou to as sist in covering the remaining troops and trains. During the same night the corps of Sumner and Heintzelman, and the division of Smith, were ordered to an interior line, the left resting on Keyes's old intrenchments, and curving to the right, so as to cover Savage's station. General Slocum's division, of Franklin's corps, was ordered to Savage's station, in reserve. They were ordered to hold this position until dark of the 29th, in order to cover the withdrawal of the trains, and then to fall back across the swamp and unite with the remainder of the army. On the 28th I sent the following to the Secretary of War: \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \"Savage's Station, June 28, 1862 \u2014 12.20 a. m. \" I now know the full history of the day. On this side of the river (the right hank) we repulsed several strong attacks. On the left bank our men did all that men could do, all that soldiers could accomplish, but they were overwhelmed by vastly superior numbers, even after I brought my last reserves into action. The loss on both sides is terrible. I believe it will prove to be the most desper ate battle of the war. The sad remnants of my men behave as men. Those"], [140, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 132 battalions who fought most bravely, and suffered most, are still in the best order. My regulars were superb; and I count upon what are left to turn another battle, in company with their gallant comrades of the volunteers. Had I twenty thousand (20,000,) or even ten thousand, (10,000,) fresh troops to use to-morrow, I could take Richmond ; but I have not a man in reserve, and shall be glad to cover my retreat and save the material and personnel of the army. \" If we have lost the day, we have yet preserved our honor, and no one need blush for the army of the Potomac. I have lost this battle because my force was too small. \"I again repeat that I am not responsible for this, and I say it with the earnestness of a general who feels in his heart the loss of every brave man who has been needlessly sacrificed to-day. I still hope to retrieve our fortunes; but to do this the government must view the matter in the same earnest light that I do. You must send me very large re-enforcements, and send them at once. I shall draw back to this side of the Chickahominy, and think I can withdraw all our material. Please understand that in this battle we have lost nothing but men, and those the best we have. \" In addition to what I have already said, I only wish to say to the President that I think he is wrong in regarding me as ungenerous when I said that my force was too weak. I merely intimated a truth which to-day has been too plainly proved. If, at this instant, I could dispose of ten thousand (10,000) fresh men, I could gain the victory to-morrow. \"I know that a few thousand more men would have changed this battle from a defeat to a victory. As it is, the government must not and cannot hold me responsible for the result. \" I feel too earnestly to-night. I have seen too many dead and wounded comrades to feel otherwise than that the government has not sustained this army. If you do not do so now, the game is lost. \"If I save this army now, I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you, or to any other persons in Washington. \"You have done your best to sacrifice this army. \"G. B. McCLELLAN. \"Hon. E. M. Stanton.\" The headquarters camp at Savage's station was broken up early on the morning of the 29th, and moved across White Oak swamp. As the essential pait of this day's operation was the passage of the trains across the swamp, and their protection against attack from the direction of New Market and Rich mond, as well as the immediate and secure establishment of our communications with the gunboats, I passed the day in examining the ground, directing the posting of troops, and securing the uninterrupted movement of the trains. In the afternoon I instructed General Keyes to move during the night to James river, and occupy a defensive position near Malvern hill, to secure our extreme left flank. General F. J. Porter was ordered to follow him, and prolong the line towards the right. The trains were to be pushed on towards James river in rear of these corps, and placed under the protection of the gunboats as they arrived. A sharp skirmish with the enemy's cavalry early this day on the Quaker road showed that his efforts were about to be directed towards impeding our progress to the river, and rendered my presence in that quarter necessary. BATTLE OF ALLEN'S FARM. General Sumner vacated his works at Fair Oaks on June 29, at daylight, and m;.rched his command to Orchard station, halting at Allen's field between Orchard and Savage's station. The divisions of Richardson and Sedgwick"], [141, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. Sl'CLELLAN. 133 were formed on the right of the railroad, facing towards Richmond, Richardson holding the right, and Sedgwick joining the right of Heintzelman's corps. The first line of Richardson's division was held by General French, General Cald well supporting in the second. A log building in front of Richardson's divi sion was held by Colonel Brooks with one regiment, (53d Pennsylvania volun teers,) with Hazzard's battery on an elevated piece of ground, a little in rear of Colonel Brooks's command. At nine a. m. the enemy commenced a furious attack on the right of General Sedgwick, but were repulsed. The left of General Richardson was next attacked, the enemy attempting in vain to carry the position of Colonel Brooks. Captain Hazzard's battery, and Pettet's battery, which afterwards replaced it, were served with great effect, while the 53d Pennsylvania kept up a steady fire on the advancing enemy, compelling them at last to retire in disorder. The enemy renewed the attack three times, but were as often repulsed. BATTLE OF SAVAGE'S STATION. General Slocum arrived at Savage's station at an early hour on the 29th, and was ordered to cross White Oak swamp aud relieve General Keyes's corps. As soon as General Keyes was thus relieved, he moved towards James river, which he reached in safety, with all his artillery and baggage, early on the morning of the 30th, and took up a position below Turkey creek bridge. During the morning General Franklin heard that the enemy, after having repaired the bridges, was crossing the Chickahominy in large force, and advanc ing towards Savage's station. He communicated this information to General Sumner, at Allen's farm, and moved Smith's division to Savage's station. A little after noon General Sumner united his forces with those of General Franklin, and assumed command. I had ordered General Heintzelman, with his corps, to hold the Williamsburg road until dark, at a point where were several field-works, and a skirt of timber between these works and the railroad ; but he fell back before night, and crossed White Oak swamp at Brackett's ford. General Sumner in his report of the battle of Savage's station says : \" When the enemy appeared on the Williamsburg road I could not imagine why General Heintzelman did not attack him, and not till some time afterwards did I learn, to my utter amazement, that General Heintzelman had left the field, and retreated with his whole corps (about 15,000 men) before the action commenced. This defection might have been attended with the most disastrous consequences; and although we beat the enemy signally and drove him from the field, wo should certainly have given him a more crushing blow if General Heiutzelman had been there with his corps.\" General Heintzelman in his report of the operations of his corps says: \"On the night of the 2Sth of June I received orders to withdraw the troops of my corps from the advanced position they had taken on the 25th of June, and to occupy the intrenched lines about a mile in rear. A map was sent me, showing the positions General Sumner's and General Franklin's corps would occupy. \"About sunrise the next day our troops slowly fell back to the new position, cautiously followed by the enemy, taking possession of our camps as soon as we left them. \" From some misapprehension General Sumner held a more advanced position than was indicated on the map furnished me, thus leaving a space of about three-fourths of a mile between the right of his corps and General Smith's divi sion of General Franklin's corps. \u2022"], [142, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 134 \"At 11 a. m. on the 29th the enemy commenced an attack on General Sum ner's troops, a few shells falling within my lines. Late in the forenoon reports reached me that the rebels were in possession of Dr. Trent's house, only a mile and a half from Savage's station. I sent several cavalry reconnoissances, and finally was satisfied of the fact. General Franklin came to my headquarters, when I learned of the interval between his left and General Sumner's right, in which space Dr. Trent's house is ; also that the rebels had repaired one of the bridges across the Chickahominy, and were advancing. 6 # # * # * # * * \"I rode forward to see General Sumner, and met his troops falling back on the Williamsburg road through my lines. General Sumner infoi-med me that he intended to make a stand at Savage's station, and for me to join him to determine upon the position. \" This movement of General Sumner's uncovering my right flank, it became necessary for me to at once withdraw my troops. * \" I rode back to find General Sumner. After some delay, from the mass of troops in the field, I found him, and learned that the course of action had been determined on ; so I returned to give the necessary orders for the destruction of the railroad cars, ammunition, and provisions still remaining on the ground. \"The whole open space near Savage's station was crowded with troops \u2014 more than I supposed could be brought into action judiciously. An aid from the commanding general had in the morning reported to me to point out a road across the White Oak swamp, starting from the left of General Kearney's posi tion and leading by Brackett's ford. * * * * * * \"The advance of the column reached the Charles City road at 6 J p. m., and the rear at 10 p. m., without accident.\" The orders given by me to Generals Sumner, Heintzelman, and Franklin were to hold the positions assigned them until dark. As stated by General Heintzelman, General Sumner did not occupy the designated position ; but, as he was the senior officer present on that side of the White Oak swamp, he may have thought that the movements of the enemy justified a deviation from the letter of the orders. It appears from his report that he assumed command of all the troops near Savage's station, and determined to resist the enemy there ; and that he gave General Heintzelman orders to hold the same position as I had assigned him. The aid sent by me to General Heintzelman to point out the road across the swamp was to guide him in retiring after dark. On reaching Savage's station, Sumner's and Franklin's commands were drawn up in line of battle in the large open field to the left of the railroad, the left resting on the edge of the woods, and the right extending down to the railroad. General Brooks, with his brigade, held the wood to the left of the field, where he did excellent service, receiving a wound, but retaining his command. General Hancock's brigade was thrown into the woods on the right and front. At 4 p. m. the enemy commenced his attack in large force by the Williamsburg road. It was gallantly met by General Burns's brigade, supported and re-en forced by two lines in reserve, and finally by the New York 69th, Hazzard's and Pettet's batteries again doing good service. Osborn's and Bramhall's bat teries also took part effectively in this action, which was continued with great obstinacy until between 8 and 9 p. m., when the enemy were driven from the field. Immediately after the battle the orders were repeated for all the troops to fall back and cross White Oak swamp, which was accomplished during the night in good order. By midnight all the troops were on the road to White"], [143, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. ll'CLELLAN. 135 Oak swamp bridge, General French, with his brigade, acting as rear guard, and at 5 a. m. on the 30th all had crossed and the bridge was destroyed. On the afternoon of the 29th I gave to the corps commanders their instruc tions for the operations of the following day. As stated before, Porter's corps was to move forward to James river, and, with the corps of General Keyes, to occupy a position at or near Turkey Bend, on a line perpendicular to the river, thus covering the Charles City road to Richmond, opening communication with the gunboats, and covering the passage of the supply trains, which were pushed forward as rapidly as possible upon Haxall's plantation. The remaining corps were pressed onward, and posted so as to guard the approaches from Richmond, as well as the crossings of the White Oak swamp, over which the army had passed. General Franklin was ordered to hold the passage of White Oak swamp bridge, and cover the witlrflrawal of the trains from that point. His command consisted of his own corps, with General Richardson's division and General Naglee's brigade placed under his orders for the occasion. General Slocum's division was on the right of the Charles City road. On the morning of the 30th I again gave to the corps commanders within reach instructions for posting their troops. I found that, notwithstanding all the efforts of my personal staff and other officers, the roads were blocked by wagons, and there was great difficulty in keeping the trains in motion. The engineer officers whom I had sent forward on the 28th to reconnoitre the roads had neither returned nor sent me any reports or guides. Generals Keyes and Porter had been delayed \u2014 one by losing the road, and the other by repairing an old road \u2014 and had not been able to send any information. We then knew of but one road for the movement of the troops and our immense trains. It was therefore necessary to post the troops in advance of this road as well as our limited knowledge of the ground permitted, so as to cover the movement of the trains in the rear. I then examined the whole line from the swamp to the left, giving final in structions for the posting of the troops and the obstructions of the roads toward Richmond, and all corps commanders were directed to hold their positions until the trains had passed, after which a more concentrated position was to be taken up near James river. Our force was too small to occupy and hold the entire line from the White Oak swamp to the river, exposed, as it was, to be taken in reverse by a move ment across the lower part of the swamp, or across the Chickahominy, below the swamp. Moreover, the trocps were then greatly exhausted, and required rest in a more secure position. I extended my examinations of the country as far as Haxall's, looking at all the approaches to Malvern, which position I perceived to be the key to our operations in this quarter, and was thus enabled to expedite very considerably the passage of the trains, and to rectify the positions of the troops. Everything being then quiet, I sent aids to the different corps commanders to inform them what I had done on the left, and to bring me information of the condition of affairs on the right. I returned from Malvern to Haxall's^ and having made arrangements for instant communication from Malvern by signals, went on board of Captain Rodgers's gunboat, lying near, to confer with him in reference to the condition of our supply vessels, and the state of things on the river. It was his opinion that it would be necessary for the army to fall back to a position below City Point, as the channel there was so near the southern shore that it would not be possible to bring up the transports, should the enemy occupy it. Harrison's landing was, in his opinion, the nearest suitable point.

The country in General McCall's, front was an open field, intersected towards the right by the New Market road, and a small strip of timber parallel to it ; the open front was about 800 yards, its depth about 1,000 yards. On the morning of, the 30th General Heintzelman ordered the bridge at Braek ett's ford to be destroyed, and trees to be felled across that road and the Charles City road. General Slocum's division was to extend to the Charles City road. General Kearney's left to connect with General Slocum's left. General McCall's position was to the left of the Long bridge road, in connexion with General Kearney's left. General Hooker was on the left of General McCall. Between 12 and 1 o'clock the enemy opened a fierce cannonade upon the divisions of Smith and Richardson, and Naglee's brigade, at White Oak swamp bridge. This artillery fire was continued by the enemy through the day, and he crossed some infantry below our position. Richardson's division suffered severely. Captain Ayres directed our artillery with great effect. Captain Hazzard's bat tery, after losing many cannoneers, and Captain Hazzard being mortally wounded, was compelled to retire. It was replaced by Pettit's battery, which partially silenced the enemy's guns. General Franklin held his position until after dark, r-epeatedly driving back the enemy in their attempts to cross the White Oak swamp. At two o'clock in the day the enemy were reported advancing in force by the Charles City road, and at half past two o'clock the attack was made down the road on General Slocum's left, but was checked by his artillery. After this the enemy, in large force, comprising the divisions of Longstreet and A. P. Hill, attacked General McCall, whose division, after severe fighting, was compelled to retire. General McCall, in his report of the battle, says : * * # # * \" About half past two my pickets were driven in by a strong advance, after some skirmishing, without loss on our part. \" At three o'clock the enemy sent forward a regiment on the left centre and another on the right centre to feel for a weak point. They were under cover of a shower of shells, and boldly advanced, but were both driven back \u2014 on the left by the 12th regiment, and on the right by the 7th regiment. \" For nearly two hours the battle raged hotly here.\" * * * \"At last the enemy was compelled to retire before the well-directed musketry fire of the reserves. The German batteries were driven to the rear, but I \"rode up and sent them back. It was, however, of little avail, and they were soon after abandoned by the cannoneers.\" * * * * * * * \" The batteries in front of the centre were boldly charged upon, but the enemy was speedily forced back.\" ####### \" Soon after this a most determined charge was made on Randall's battery by a full brigade, advancing in wedge shape, without order, but in perfect reckless ness. Somewhat similar charges had, I have stated, been previously made on"], [145, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 137 Cooper's and Kern's batteries by single regiments without success, they having recoiled before the storm of canister hurled against them. A like result was anticipated by Randall's battery, and the 4th regiment was requested not to fire until the battery had done with them. \"Its gallant co\u00c6mander did not doubt his ability to repel the attack, and his guns did, indeed, mow down the advancing host, but still the gaps were closed, and the enemy came in upon a run to the very muzzle of his guns. \" It was a perfect torrent of men, and they were in his battery before the guns could be removed. Two guns that were, indeed, successfully limbered, had their horses killed and wounded and were overturned on the spot, and the enemy, dashing past, drove the greater part of the 4th regiment before them. \"The left company, (B,) nevertheless, stood its ground, with its captain, Fred. A. Conrad, as did, likewise, certain men of other companies. I had ridden into the regiment and endeavored to check them, but with only partial success.\" ******* \" There was no running. But my division, reduced by the previous battles to less than six thousand, (6,000,) had to contend with the divisions of Long street and A. P. Hill, considered two of the strongest and best among many of the confederate army, numbering that day 18,000 or 20,000 men, aud it was reluctantly compelled to give way before heavier force accumulated upon them.\" JfC ?fC 3\u00a7C 2f\u00bb *|C SfE fls General Heintzelman states that about 5 o'clock p. m. General McCall's division was attacked in large force, evidently the principal attack ; that in less than an hour the division gave way, and adds : \" General Hooker being on his left, by moving to his right, repulsed the rebels in the handsomest manner with great slaughter. General Sumner, who was with General Sedgwick in McCall's rear, also greatly aided with his artillery and infantry in driving back the ene my. They now renewed their attack with vigor ou General Kearney's left, and were again repulsed with heavy loss.\" Jp *r- *r* \"F t* V *r- \"This attack commenced about 4 p. m., and was pushed by heavy masses with the utmost determination and vigor. Captain Thompson's battery, directed with great precision, firing double charges, swept them back. The whole open space, two hundred paces wide, was filled with the enemy ; each repulse brought fresh troops. The third attack was only repulsed by the rapid volleys aud de termined charge of the 63d Pennsylvania, Colonel Hayrs, and half of the 37th New York volunteers.\" General McCall's troops soon began to emerge from the woods into the open field. Several batteries were in position and began to fire into the woods over the heads of our men in front. Captain DeRussy's battery was placed on the right of General Sumner's artillery with orders to shell the woods. General Burns's brigade was then advanced to meet the enemy, and soon drove him back ; other troops began to return from the White Oak swamp. Late in the day, at the call of General Kearney, General Taylor's first New Jersey brigade, Slocum's division, was sent to occupy a portion of General McCall's deserted position, a battery accompanying the brigade. They soon drove back the enemy, who shortly after gave up the attack, contenting themselves with keep ing up a desultory firing till late at night. Between 12 and 1 o'clock at night General Heintzelman commenced to withdraw his corps, and soon after daylight both of his divisions, with General Slocum's division and a portion of General Sumner's command, reached Malvern hill. On the morning of the 30th General Sumner, in obedience to orders, had moved promptly to Glendale, and upon a call from General Franklin for re-enforcements, sent him two brigades, which returned in time to participate and render good service in the battle near Glendale. General Sumner says of this battle :"], [146, "138 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. \" The battle of Glendale was the most severe action since the battle of Fair Oaks. About 3 o'clock p. m. the action commenced, and after a furious contest, lasting till after dark, the enemy was routed at all points and driven from the field.\" The rear of the supply trains and the reserve artillery or the army reached Malvern hill about 4 p. m. At about this time the enemy began to appear in General Porter's front, and at 5 o'clock advanced in large force against his left flank, posting artillery under cover of a skirt of timber, with a view to engage our force on Malvern hill, while with his infantry and some artillery he attacked Colonel Warren's brigade. A concentrated fire of about thirty guns was brought to bear on the enemy, which, with the infantry fire of Colonel Warren's command, compelled him to retreat, leaving two guns in the hands of Colonel Warren. The gunboats rendered most efficient aid at this time, and helped to drive back the enemy. It was very late at night before my aids returned to give me the results of the day's fighting along the whole line, and the true position of affairs. While waiting to hear from General Franklin, before sending orders to Generals Sum ner and Heintzelman, I received a message from the latter that General Frank lin was falling back; whereupon I sent Colonel Colburn, of my staff, with orders to verify this, and if it were true, to order in Generals Sumner and Heintzelman at once. He had not gone far when he met two officers sent from General Franklin's headquarters with the information that he was falling back. Orders were then sent to General Sumner and Heintzelman to fall back also, and defi nite instructions were given as to the movement which was to commence on the right. The orders met these troops already en route to Malvern. Instructions were also sent to General Franklin as to the route he was to follow. General Barnard then received full instructions for posting the troops as they arrived. I then returned to Haxall's, and again left for Malvern soon after daybreak. Accompanied by several general officers, I once more made the entire circuit of the position, and then returned to Haxall's, whence I went with Captain Rod gers to select the final location for the army and its depots. I returned to Mal vern before the serious fighting commenced, and after riding along the lines, and seeing most cause to feel anxious about the right, remained in that vicinity. BATTLE OF MALVERN HILL. The position selected for resisting the further advance of the enemy on the 1st of July was with the left and centre of our lines resting on Malvern hill, while the right curved backwards through a wooded country towards a point below Haxall's, on James river. Malvern hill is an elevated plateau about a mile and a half by three-fourths of a mile in area, well cleared of timber, and with several converging roads running over it. In front are numerous defensible ravines, and the ground slopes gradually toward the north and east to the wood land, giving clear ranges for artillery in those directions. Towards the north west the plateau falls off more abruptly into a ravine which extends to James river. From the position of the enemy his most obvious lines of attack would come from the direction of Richmond and White Oak swamp, and would almost of necessity strike us upon our left wing. Here, therefore, the lines were strengthened by massing the troops and collecting the principal part of the ar tillery. Porter's corps held the left of the line, (Sykes's division on the left, Morell's on the right,) with the artillery of his two divisions advantageously posted, and the artillery of the reserve so disposed on the high ground that a concentrated fire of some sixty guns could be brought to bear on any point in his front or left. Colonel Tyler also had, with great exertion, succeeded in getting ten of his siege guns in position on the highest point of the hill."], [147, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 139 Couch's division was placed on the right of Porter; next came Kearney and Hooker; next Sedgwick and Richardson; next Smith and Slocum; then the re mainder of Keyes's corps, extending by a backwood curve nearly to the river. The Pennsylvania reserve corps was held in reserve, and stationed behind Por ter's and Couch's position. One brigade of Porter's was thrown to the left on the low ground to protect that flank from any movement direct from the Rich mond road. The line was very strong along the whole front of the open pla teau, but from thence to the extreme right the troops were more deployed. This formation was imperative, as an attack would probably be made upon our left. The right was rendered as secure as possible by slashing the timber and by barricading the roads. Commodore Rodgers, commanding the flotilla on James river, placed his gunboats so as to protect our flank, and to command the approaches from Richmond. Between 9 and 10 a. m. the enemy commenced feeling along our whole left wing, with his artillery and skirmishers, as far to the right as Hooker's division. About 2 o'clock a column of the enemy was observed moving towards our right, within the skirt of woods in front of Heintzelman's corps, but beyond the range of our artillery. Arrangements were at once made to meet the anticipated attack in that quarter, but, though the column was long, occupying more than two hours in passing, it disappeared, and was not again heard of. The pre sumption is, that it retired by the rear, and participated in the attack afterwards made on our left. About 3 p. m. a heavy fire of artillery opened on Kearney's left and Couch's division, speedily followed up by a brisk attack of infantry on Couch's front. The artillery was replied to with good effect by our own, and the infantry of Couch's division remained lying on the ground until the advancing column was within short musket range, when they sprang to their feet and poured in a deadly Volley which entirely broke the attacking force and drove them in dis order back over their own ground. This advantage was followed up until we had advanced the right of our line some seven or eight hundred yards, and rested upon a thick clump of trees, giving us a stronger position aud a better fire. Shortly after four o'clock the firing ceased along the whole front, but no dis- position was evinced on the part of the enemy to withdraw from the field. Caldwell's brigade, having been detached from Richardson's division, was sta- tioned upon Couch's right by General Porter, to whom he had been ordered to report. The whole line was surveyed by the general, and everything held in readiness to meet the coming attack. At six o'clock the enemy suddenly opened upon Couch and Porter with the whole strength of his artillery, and at once be- gan pushing forward his columns of attack to carry the hill. Brigade after brigade, formed under cover of the woods, started at a run to cross the open space and charge our batteries, but the heavy fire of our guns, with the cool and steady volleys of our infantry, in every case sent them reeling back to shelter, and covered the ground with their dead and wounded. In several instances our infantry withheld their fire until the attacking column, which rushed through the Btorm of canister and shell from our artillery, had reached within a few yards of our lines. They then poured in a single volley and dashed forward with the bayonet, capturing prisoners and colors, and driving the routed columns in con- fusion from the field. About 7 o'clock, as fresh troops were accumulating in front of Porter and Couch, Meagher and Sickles were sent with their brigades, as soon as it was considered prudent to withdraw any portion of Sumner's and Heintzelman's troops, to re-enforce that part of the line and hold the position. These brigades relieved such regiments of Porter's corps and Couch's division as had expended their ammunition, and batteries from the reserve were pushed forward to replace those whose boxes were empty. Until dark the enemy persisted in his efforts"], [148, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 140 to take the position so tenaciously defended; but, despite his vastly superior numbers, his repeated and desperate attacks were repulsed with fearful loss, and darkness ended the battle of Malvern hill, though it was not untd after 9 o clock that the artillery ceased its fire. Diii-in- the whole battle Commodore Rodgers added greatly to the discom fiture of \"the enemy, by throwing shell among his reserves and advancing coi- umns. ' ,_.,,-,. As the army in its movement from the Chickahominy to Harrison s landing was continually occupied in marching by night and fighting bj day its com manders found no time or opportunity for collecting data which would enable them to give exact returns of casualties in each engagement. The aggregate of our entire losses from the 26th of June to the 1st of July, inclusive, was ascer tained, after arriving at Harrison's landing, to be as follows : List of the killed, wounded, and missing in the army of the Potomac from the 26th of June to the 1st of July, 1862, inclusive. * Pennsylvania reserves. Although the result of the battle of Malvern was a complete victory, it .was, nevertheless, necessary to fall back still further, in order to reach a point where our supplies could be brought to us with certainty. As before stated, in the opinion of Captain Rodgers, commanding the gunboat flotilla, this could only be done below City Point; concurring in his opinion, I selected Harrison's bar as the new position of the army. The exhaustion of our supplies of food, forage, and ammunition, made it imperative to reach the transports immediately. The greater portion of the transportation o'f the army having been started for Harrison's landing during the night of the 30th of June and 1st of July, the order for the movement of the troops was at once issued upon the final repulse of the enemy at Malvern hill. The order prescribed a movement by the left and rear, General Keyes's corps to cover the man\u0153uvre. It was not carried out in detail as regards the divisions on the left, the roads being somewhat blocked by the rear of our trains. Porter and Couch were not able to move out as early as had been anticipated, and Porter found it necessary to place a rear guard between his command and the enemy. Colonel Averiil, of the 3d Pennsylvania cavalry, was intrusted with this delicate duty. He had und^r his command his own regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Buchanan's brigade of regular infantry and one battery. By a judicious use of the resources at his command he deceived the enemy so as to cover the withdrawal of the left wing without being attacked, remaining himself on the previous clay's battle-field until about 7 o'clock of the 2d of July. Meantime General Keyes, having received his orders, commenced vigorous preparations for covering the movement of the entire army and protecting the trains.

He made preparations for obstructing the roads, after the army had passed, so as to prevent any rapid pur suit, destroying effectually Turkey bridge, on the main road, and rendering other roads and approaches temporarily impassable by felling trees across them. He kept the trains well closed up, and directed the march so that the troops could move on each side of the roads, not obstructing the passage, but being in good position to repel an attack from any quarter. His dispositions were so success ful that, to use his own words, \" 1 do not think more vehicles or more public property were abandoned on the march from Turkey bridge than would have been left, in the same state of the roads, if the army had been moving toward the enemy instead of away from him. Aud when it is understood that the car riages and teams belonging to this army, stretched out in one line, would extend not far from forty miles, the energy and caution necessary for their safe withdrawal from the presence of an enemy, vastly superior in numbers, will be appreciated.\" The last of the wagons did not reach the site selected at Harrison's bar until after dark on the 3d of July, and the rear guard did not move into their camp until everything was secure. The enemy followed up with a small force, and on the 3d threw a few shells at the rear guard, but were quickly dispersed by our batteries and the sire of the gunboats. Great credit must be awarded to General Keyes for the skill and energy which characterized his performance of the important and delicate duties in trusted to his charge. High praise is also due to the officers and men of the 1st Connecticut artil lery, Colonel Tyler, for the manner in which they withdrew all the heavy guns during the seven days, and from Malvern hill. Owing to the crowded state of the roads the teams could not be brought within a couple of miles of the posi tion, but these energetic soldiers removed the guns by hand for that distance, leaving nothing behind. THIRD PERIOD. On the 1st July I received the following from the President : \"Washington, July 1, 1862 \u2014 3.30^. m. \"It is impossible to re-enforce you for your present emergency.

Had their attack succeeded, the consequences would have been disastrous in the extreme. This closed the hard fighting which had con tinued from the afternoon of the 26th ultimo, in a daily series of engagements wholly unparalleled on this continent for determination and slaughter on both sides. \" The mutual loss in killed and wounded is enormous. That of the enemy certainly greatest. On Tuesday morning, the 1st, our army commenced its movement from Haxall's to this point, our line of defence there being too extended to be maintained by our weakened forces. Our train was immense, and about 4 p. m. on the 2d a heavy storm of rain began, which continued during the entire day and until the forenoon of yesterday. \" The roads became horrible. Troops, artillery, and wagons moved on steadily, and our whole army, men and material, was finally brought safe into this camp. \" The last of the wagons reached here at noon yesterday. The exhaustion was very great, but the army preserved its morale, and would have repelled any attack which the enemy was in condition to make. \" We now occupy a line of heights, about two miles from the James, a plain extending from there to the river ; our front is about three miles long ; these heights command our wdiole position, and must be maintained. The gunboats can render valuable support upon both flanks. If the enemy attack us in front we must hold our ground as we best may, and at whatever cost. \" Our positions can be carried only by overwhelming numbers. The spirit of the army is excellent ; stragglers are finding their regiments, and the soldier3 exhibit the best results of discipline. Our position- is by no means impreg nable, especially as a morass extends on this side of the high ground from our centre to the James on our right. The enemy may attack in vast numbers, and if so, our front will be the scene of a desperate battle, which, if lost, will be decisive. Our army is fearfully weakened by killed, wounded and prisoners. \" I cannot now approximate to any statement of our losses, but we were not beaten in any conflict. \"The enemy were unable, by their utmost efforts, to drive us from any field. Never did such a change of base, involving a retrograde movement, and under incessant attacks from a most determined and vastly more numerous foe, par take so little of disorder.

Lincoln, President.\" While general-in-chief, and directing the operations of all our armies in the field, I had become deeply impressed with the importance of adopting and car rying out certain views regarding the conduct of the war, which, in my judgment, were essential to its objects and its success. During an active campaign of three months in the enemy's country, these were so fully confirmed that I conceived it a duty, in the critical position we then occupied, not to withhold a candid expression of the more important of these views from the commander-in-chief, whom the Constitution places at the head of the armies and navies, as well as of the government of the nation. The following is a copy of my letter to Mr. Lincoln : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \"Camp near Harrison's Landing, Va., July 7, 1862. \"Mr. President : You have been fully informed that the rebel army- is in the front, with the purpose of overwhelming us by attacking our positions or reducing us by blocking our river communications. I cannot but regard our condition as critical, and I earnestly desire, in view of possible contingencies, to lay before your excellency, for your private consideration, my general views concerning the existing state of the rebellion, although they do not strictly re late to the situation of this army, or strictly come within the scope of my official duties. These views amount to convictions, and are deeply impressed upon my mind and heart. Our cause must never be abandoned ; it is the cause of free institutions and self-government. The Constitution and the Union must be preserved, whatever may be the cost in time, treasure, and blood. If seces sion is successful, other dissolutions are clearly to be seen in the future. Let neither military disaster, political faction, nor foreign war shake your settled purpose to enforce the equal operation of the laws of the United States upon the people of every State. \" The time has come when the government must determine upon a civil and military policy, covering the whole ground of our national trouble. \" The responsibility of determining, declaring, and supporting such civil and military policy, and of directing the whole course of national affairs in regard to the rebellion, must now be assumed and exercised by you, or our cause will be lost. The Constitution gives you power, even for the present terrible exigency. \" This rebellion has assumed the character of a war ; as such it should be regarded, and it should be conducted upon the highest principles known to christian civilization. It should not be a war looking to the subjugation of the people of any State, in any event. It should not be at all a war upon popula tion, but against armed forces and political organizations. Neither confiscation"], [153, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 145 of property, political executions of persons, territorial organization of States, or forcible abolition of slavery, should be contemplated for a moment. \" In prosecuting the war, all private property and unarmed persons should be strictly protected, subject only to the necessity of military operations ; all pri vate property taken for military use should be paid or receipted for ; pillage and waste should be treated as high crimes ; all unnecessary trespass sternly pro hibited, and offensive demeanor by the military towards citizens promptly rebuked. Military arrests should not. be tolerated, except in places where active hostilities exist ; and oaths, not required by enactments, constitutionally made, should be neither demanded nor received. \" Military government should be confined to the preservation of public order and the protection of political right. Military power should not be allowed to interfere with the relations of servitude, either by supporting or impairing the authority of the master, except for repressing disorder, as in other cases. Slaves, contraband under the act of Congress, seeking military protection, should receive it. The right of the government to appropriate permanently to its own service claims to slave labor should be asserted, and the right of the owner to compen sation therefor should be recognized. This principle might be extended, upon grounds of military necessity and security, to all the slaves of a particular State, thus working manumission in such State ; and in Missouri, perhaps in Western Virginia also, and possibly even in Maryland, the expediency of such a measure is only a question of time. A system of policy thus constitutional, and pervaded by the influences of Christianity and freedom, would receive the support of almost all truly ' loyal men, would deeply impress the rebel masses and all foreign nations, and it might be humbly hoped that it would commend itself to the favor of the Almighty. \" Unless the principles governing the future conduct of our struggle shall be made known and approved, the effort to obtain requisite forces will be almost hopeless.

General Hooker, with his own division, and Pleasonton's cavalry, was therefore directed to gain possession of Malvern hill on the night of the 2d of August.

As the service of every man would be important in the event of a forward offensive movement, I considered it to be of the utmost consequence that I should know what was to be done.

I did not, as the commander of that army, allow the occasion to pass without distinctly setting forth my views upon the subject to the authorities in the fol lowing telegram :"], [162, "154 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B.

I fear it will be a fatal blow. Several days are necessary to complete the preparations for so important a movement as this, and while they are in progress, I beg that careful consideration may be given to my statements. \" This army is now in excellent discipline and condition. We hold a de bouche on both banks of the James river, so that we are free to act in any direction ; and with the assistance of the gunboats, I consider our communications as now secure \" We are twenty-five (25) miles from Richmond, and are not likely to meet the enemy in force sufficient to fight a battle until we have marched fifteen (15) to eighteen (18) miles, which brings us practically within ten (10) miles of Rich mond. Our longest line of land transportation would be from this point twenty five (25) miles, but with the aid of the gunboats we can supply the army by water during its advance, certainly to within twelve (12) miles of Richmond. \" At Aquia creek we would be seventy -five (75) miles from Richmond, with land transportation all the way. \"From here to Fort Monroe is a march of about seventy (70) miles, for I regard it as impracticable to withdraw this army and its material, except by land. \" The result of the movement would thus be a march of one hundred and forty-five (145) miles to reach a point now only twenty-five (25) miles distant, and to deprive ourselves entirely of the powerful aid of the gunboats and water transportation. \"Add to this the certain demoralization of this army which would ensue, the terribly depressing effect upon the people of the north, and the strong probability that it would influence foreign powers to recognize our adversaries; and these appear to me sufficient reasons to make it my imperative duty to urge in the strongest terms afforded by our language that this order may be rescinded, and that far from recalling this army, it may be promptly re-enforced to enable it to resume the offensive. \" It may be said that there are no re-enforcements available. I point to Burnside's force ; to that of Pope, not necessary to maintain a strict defensive in front of Washington and Harper's Ferry ; to those portions of the army of the west not required for a strict defensive there. Here, directly in front of this army, is the heart of the rebellion ; it is here that all our resources should be collected ,to strike the blow which will determine the fate of the nation. \" All points of secondary importance elsewhere should be abandoned, and every available man brought here ; a decided victory here, and the military strength of the rebellion is crushed.

And even after that interview I tried every means in my power to avoid withdrawing your army, and delayed my decision as long as I dared to delay it. \" I assure you, general, it was not a hasty and inconsiderate act, but one that caused me more anxious thoughts than any other of my life.

Since then, you and others report that they have received and are receiving large re-enforcements from the south. General Pope's army, covering Washington, is only about forty thousand. Your effective force is only about ninety thousand. You are thirty7 miles from Richmond, and General Pope eighty or ninety, with the enemy directly between you ready to fall with his superior numbers upon one or the other as he may elect ; neither can re-enforce the other in case of such an attack. \"If General Pope's army be diminished to re-enforce you, Washington, Maryland, and Pennsylvania would be left uncovered and exposed. If your force be reduced to strengthen Pope, you would be too weak to even hold the position you now occupy, should the enemy turn round and attack you in full force. In other words, the old army of the Potomac is split into two parts, with the entire force of the enemy directly between them. They cannot be united by land without exposing both to destruction, and yet they must be united. To send Pope's forces by water to the Peninsula is, under present circumstances, a military impossibility. The only alternative is to send the forces on the Peninsula to some point by water, say Fredericksburg, where the two armies can be united. \"Let me now allude to some of the objections which you have urged: you say that the withdrawal from the present position will cause the certain de moralization of the army 'which is now in excellent discipline and condition.' \"I cannot understand why a simple change of position to a new and by no means distant base will demoralize an army in excellent discipline, unless the officers themselves assist in that demoralization, which I am satisfied they will not. \" Your change of front from your extreme right at Hanover Court House to your present condition was over thirty miles, but I have not heard that it de moralized your troops, notwithstanding the severe losses they sustained in effecting it. \" A new base on the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg brings you within about sixty miles of Richmond, and secures a re-enforcement of forty or fifty thousand fresh and disciplined troops. \" The change with such advantages will, I think, if properly represented to your army, encourage rather than demoralize your troops. Moreover, you your self suggested that a junction might be effected at Yorktown, but that a flank march across the isthmus would be more hazardous than to retire to Fort Monroe. \"You will remember that Yorktown is two or three miles further than Fred ericksburg is. Besides, the latter is between Richmond and Washington, and covers Washington from any attack of the enemy. \" The political effect of the withdrawal may at first be unfavorable ; but I think the public are beginning to understand its necessity, and that they will have much more confidence in a united army than in its separated fragments."], [165, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 157 \" But you will reply, why not re-enforce me here, so that I can strike Rich mond from my present position ? To do this, you said, at our interview, that you required thirty thousand additional troops. I told you that it was impos sible to give you so many. You finally thought that you would have ' some chance' of success with twenty thousand. But you afterwards telegraphed me that you would require thirty-five thousand, as the enemy was being largely re-enforced. \" If your estimate of the enemy's strength was correct, your requisition was perfectly reasonable ; but it was utterly impossible to fill it until new troo could be enlisted and organized, which would require several weeks. \" To keep your army in its present position until it could it be so re-enforced would almost destroy it in that climate. \"The months of August and September are almost fatal to whites who live on that part of James river ; and even after you received the re-enforcements asked for, you admitted that you must reduce Fort Darling and the river batteries be fore you could advance on Richmond. \" It is by no means certain that the reduction of these fortifications would not require considerable time \u2014 perhaps as much as those at Yorktown. \" This delay might not only be fatal to the health of your army, but in the mean time General Pope's forces would be exposed to the heavy blows of the enemy without the slightest hope of assistance from you. \" In regard to the demoralizing effect of a withdrawal from the Peninsula to the Rappahannock, I must remark that a large number of your highest officers, indeed a majority of those whose opinions have been reported to me, are de cidedly in favor of the movement. Even several of those who originally ad vocated the line of the Peninsula now advise its abandonment. \" I have not inquired, and do not wish to know, by whose advice or for what reasons the army of the Potomac was separated into two parts with the enemy between them. I must take things as I find them. \" I find the forces divided, and I wish to unite them. Only one feasible plan has been presented for doing this. If you, or any one else, had presented a better plan, I certainly should have adopted it. But all of your plans require re-enforcements which it is impossible to give you. It is very easy to ask for re-enforcements, but it is not so easy to give them when you have no disposable troops at your command. \" I have written very plainly as I understand the case, and I hope you will give me credit for having fully considered the matter, although I may have ar rived at very different conclusions from your own. \" Very respectfully, your obedient servant, \"H.

It is positively the fact that no more men could have been embarked hence than have gone, and that no unnecessary delay has occurred. Before your orders were received, Colonel Ingalls directed all available vessels to come from Monroe. Officers have been sent to take personal direction. Have heard nothing here of Burnside's fleet. \" There are some vessels at Monroe, such as Atlantic and Baltic, which draw too much to come here. Hospital accommodations exhausted this side New York.

We cannot use heavily loaded supply vessels for troops or animals; and such constitute the mass of those here, which have been represented to you as capable of transporting this army. \" 1 fear you will find very great delay in embarking troops and material at Yorktown and Monroe, both from want of vessels and of facilities of embarca tion ; at least two additional wharves should at once be budt at each place. I ordered two at the latter some (2) two weeks ago, but you countermanded the order. \" I learn that wharf accommodations at Aquia are altogether inadequate for landing troops and supplies to any large extent.

McCLELLAN, \" Major General. \" Major General H. W. Halleck, \" Washington, D.

He had no cavalry, artillery, wagons, or teams. His force consisted of in fantry alone, with a few ambulances and officers' horses. His baggage was already on the transports, where it had remained since his arrival from North Carolina, and his men had only to resume their places on board. The cavalry and artillery mentioned in my despatches of the 7th, 10th and 11th, were sent to supply his total deficiency in those arms. I may also repeat that the vessels used by General Burnside had not returned from Aquia creek when the army left Harrison's bar. It will be seen by the concluding paragraph of the foregoing despatch that in order to have a more direct, speedy, and full explanation of the condition of af fairs in the army than I could by sending a single despatch by steamer to the nearest telegraph office at Jamestown island, some seventy miles distant, and waiting ten hours for a reply, I proposed to go in person to the office.

Late in the afternoon of that day, when the last man had disappeared from the deserted camps, I followed with my personal staff in the track of the grand army of the Potomac; bidding farewell to the scenes still covered with the marks of its presence, and to be forever memorable in history as the vicinity of its most brilliant exploits. Previous to the departure of the troops, I had directed Captain Duane, of the engineer corps, to proceed to Barrett's ferry, near the mouth of the Chicka hominy, and throw across the river at that point a pontoon bridge. This was executed promptly and satisfactorily under the cover of gunboats ; and an ex-"], [174, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 166 cellent bridge of about two thousand feet in length was ready for the first ar rival of troops. The greater part of the army, with its artillery, wagon trains, &c, crossed it rapidly, and in perfect order and safety, so that on the night of the 17th every thing was across the Chickahominy, except the rear guard, which crossed early on the morning of the ISth, when the pontoon bridge was immediately removed. General Porter's corps, which was the first to march from Harrison's landing, had been pushed forward rapidly, and on the 16th reached Williamsburg, where I had directed him to halt until the entire army was across the Chickahominy. On his arrival at Williamsburg, however, he received an intercepted letter, which led to the belief that General Pope would have to contend against a very heavy force then in his front. General Porter, therefore, very properly took the responsibility of continuing his march directly on to Newport News, which place he reached on the morning of the 18th of August, having, marched his corps sixty miles in the short period of three days and one night, halting one day at the crossing of the Chickahominy. The embarcation of this corps commenced as soon as transports were ready, and on the 20th it had all sailed for Aquia creek. I made the following report from Barrett's ferry : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Barrett's Ferry, Chickahominy, August 17, 1862 \u2014 11 a. m. \" Everything is removed from our camp at Harrison's bar. No property nor men left behind. \" The (5th) fifth corps is at Williamsburg with all its wagons and the reserve artillery. The (3d) third corps is on the march from Jones's bridge to Williams burg, via Diascund bridge, and has probably passed the latter before this hour. Averill's cavalry watches everything in that direction. \" The mass of the wagons have passed the pontoon bridge here, and are parked on the other side. Peck's wagons are now crossing ; his division will soon be over. Headquarters wagons follow Peck's. I hope to have every thing over to-night, and the bridge removed by daylight. May be delayed be yond that time. Came here to see Burnside, otherwise should have remained with the rear guard. Thus far all is quiet, and not a shot that I know of since we began the march. \" I shall not feel entirely secure until I have the whole army beyond the Chickahominy. I will then begin to forward troops by water as fast as trans portation permits. \" G. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding. \" Major General H. W. Halleck, \" Commanding United Slates Army, Washington, D. C.\" On the 18th and 19th our march was continued to Williamsburg and York town, and on the 20th the remainder of the army was ready to embark at York town, Fortress Monroe, and Newport News. The movement of the main body of the army on this march was covered by General Pleasonton with his cavalry and horse artillery. That officer remained at Haxall's until the army had passed Charles City Court House, when he gradually fell back, picking up the stragglers as he proceeded, and crossed the bridge over the Chickahominy, after the main body had marched towards Wil liamsburg. His troops were the last to cross the bridge, and he deserves great credit for the manner in which he performed this duty. General Averill did a similar service, in the same satisfactory way, in cover ing the march of the 3d corps. As the campaign on the Peninsula terminated here, I cannot close this part"], [175, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 167 o my report without giving an expression of my sincere thanks and gratitude to the officers and men whom I had the honor to command. From the commencement to the termination of this most arduous campaign, the army of the Potomac always evinced the most perfect subordination, zeal, and alacrity in the performance of all the duties required of it. The amount of severe labor accomplished by this army in the construction of intrenchments, roads, bridges, &c. was enormous; yet all the work was per formed with the most gratifying cheerfulness and devotion to the interests of the service. During the campaign ten severely contested and sanguinary battles had been fought, besides numerous smaller engagements, in which the troops exhibited the most determined enthusiasm and bravery. They submitted to exposure, sickness, and even death, without a murmur. Indeed, they had become veterans in their country's cause, and richly deserved the warm commendation of the government. It was in view of these facts that this seemed to me an appropriate occasion for the general-in-chief to give, in general orders, some appreciative expression of the services of the army while upon the Peninsula. Accordingly, on the 18th I sent him the following despatch : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \"August 18, 1862 \u2014 ll^j. m. \" Please say a kind word to my army, that I can repeat to them in general orders, in regard to their conduct at Yorktown, Williamsburg, West Point, Hanover Court House, and on the Chickahominy, as well as in regard to the (7) seven days and the recent retreat. \" No one has ever said anything to cheer them but myself. Say nothing about me. Merely give my men and officers credit for what they have done. It will do you much good, and will strengthen you much with them if you issue a handsome order to them in regard to what they have accomplished. They deserve it. \" G. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General. \"Major General Halleck, \" Washington, D. C.\" As no reply was received to this communication, and no order was issued by the general-in-chief, I conclude that suggestion did not meet with his approbation. All the personnel and material of the army had been transferred from Harri son's landing to the different points of embarcation in the very brief period of five days without the slightest loss or damage. Porter's troops sailei from New port News on the 19th and 20th. Heintzelman's corps sailed from Yorktown on the 21st. On that day I received the following telegram from the general in-chief : \" Washington, August 21, 1862 \u2014 6 p. m. \" Leave such garrisons in Fortress Monroe, Yorktown, &c, as you may deem proper. They will be replaced by new troops as rapidly as possible. \" The forces of Burnside and Pope are hard pushed, and require aid as rapidly as you can send it.

This report, in connexion with the despatch of the general-in-chief on the 28th, before noted, induced me to direct Franklin to halt his command near Anandale until it could be determined, by recon noissances to Vienna and towards Manassas, whether these reports were true. General Cox was ordered to send his small cavalry force from Upton's hill towards Vienna and Drainsville in one direction, and towards Fairfax Court House in the other, and Franklin to push his two squadrons as far towards Manassas as possible, in order to ascertain the true position of the enemy. With the enemy in force at Vienna, and towards Lewinsville, it would have been very injudicious to have pushed Franklin's small force beyond Anandale. It must be remembered that at that time we wTere cut off from direct communi cation with General Pope; that the enemy wras, by the last accounts, at Manas sas in strong force, and that Franklin had only from 10,000 to 11,000 men, with an entirely insufficient force of cavalry and artillery.

W. HALLECK, \"General-in-Chief. \" Major General McClellan.\" FOURTH PERIOD. On the 1st of September I went into Washington, where I had an interview with the general-in-chief, who instructed me, verbally, to take command of its defences, expressly limiting my jurisdiction to the works and their garrisons, and prohibiting me from exercising any control over the troops actively engaged in front under General Pope. During this interview I suggested to the general-"], [191, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 183 in-chief the necessity of his going in person, or sending one of his personal staff, to the army under General Pope, for the purpose of ascertaining the exact condition of affairs; he sent Colonel Kelton, his assistant adjutant general. During the afternoon of the same day I received a message from the general in-chief, to the effect that he desired me to go at once to his house to see the President. The President informed me that he had reason to believe that the army of the Potomac was not cheerfully co-operating with and supporting General Pope ; that he had \"always been a friend of mine;\" and now asked me, as a special favor, to use my influence in correcting this state of things. I replied, sub stantially, that I was confident that he was misinformed ; that I was sure, what ever estimate the army of the Potomac might entertain of General Pope, that they would obey his orders, support him to the fullest extent, and do their whole duty. The President, who was much moved, asked me to telegraph to \"Fitz-John Porter, or some other of my friends,\" and try to do away with any feeling that might exist; adding, that I could rectify the evil, and that no one else could. I thereupon told him that I would cheerfully telegraph to General Porter, or do anything else in my power to gratify his wishes and relieve his anxiety ; upon which he thanked me very warmly, assured me that he could never forget my action in the matter, &c, and left. I then wrote the following telegram to General Porter, which was sent to him by the general-in-chief: \"Washington, September 1, 1862. \" I ask of you, for my sake, that of the country, and the old army of the Poto mac, that you and all my friends will lend the fullest and most cordial co-opera tion to General Pope, in all the operations now going on. The destinies of our country, the honor of our arms, are at stake, and all depends now upon the cheerful co-operation of all in the field. This week is the crisis of our fate. Say the same thing to my friends in the army of the Potomac, and that the last request I have to make of them is, that, for their country's sake, they will extend to General Pope the same support they ever have to me. \"I am in charge of the defences of Washington, and am doing all I can to ren der your retreat safe, should that become necessary. \"GEO. B. McCLELLAN. \"Major General Porter.\" To which he sent the following reply \"Fairfax C*\u00bburt House, 10 a. m., \"September 2, 1862. \" You may rest assured that all your friends, as well as every lover of his country, will ever give, as they have given, to General Pope their cordial co operation and constant support in the execution. of all orders and plans. Our killed, wounded, and enfeebled troops attest our devoted duty. F. J. PORTER. \" General George B. McClellan, \" Major General Commanding, Washington.\" Neither at the time I wrote the telegram, nor at any other time, did I thiuk for one moment that General Porter had been, or would be, in any manner de relict in the performance of his duty to the nation and its cause. Such an im pression never entered my mind. The despatch in question was written purely at the request of the President. On the morning of the 2d the President and General Halleck came to"], [192, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 184 my house, when the President informed me that Colonel Kelton had returned from the front; that our affairs were in a bad condition; that the army was in full retreat upon the defences of Washington ; the roads filled with strag glers, &c. He instructed me to take steps at once to stop and collect the strag glers; to place the works in a proper state of defence, and to go out to meet and take command of the army, when it approached the vicinity of the works, then to place the troops in the best position \u2014 committing everything to my hands. I immediately took steps to carry out these orders, and sent an aid to Gen eral Pope with the following letter : \"Headquarters, Washington, \" September 2, 1862. \" General : General Halleck instructed me to report to you the order he sent this morning to withdraw your army to Washington, without unnecessary delay. He feared that his messenger might miss you, and desired to take this double precaution. \" In order to bring troops upon ground with which they are already familiar, it would be best to move Porter's corps upon Upton's hill, that it may occupy Hall's hill, &c; McDowell's to Upton's hill; Franklin's to the works in front of Alexandria; Heintzelman's to the same vicinity; Couch to Fort Corcoran, or, if practicable, to the Chain bridge; Sumner either to Fort Albany or to Alex andria, as may be most convenient. \" In haste, general, very truly yours, \" GEO. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General United States Army. \"Major General John Pope, \" Commanding Army of Virginia.\" In the afternoon I crossed the Potomac and rode to the front, and at Upton's hill met the advance of McDowell's corps, and with it Generals Pope and McDowell. After getting what information I could from them, I sent the few aids at my disposal to the left to give instructions to the troops approaching in the direction of Alexandria ; and hearing artillery firing in the direction of the Vienna and Langley road, by which the corps of Sumner, Porter, and Sigel were returning, and learning from General Pope that Sumner was probably en gaged, I went, with a single aid and three orderlies, by the shortest line to meet that column. I reached the column after dark, and proceeded as far as Lewinsville, where I became satisfied that the rear corps (Sumner's) would be able to reach its intended position without any serious molestation. I therefore indicated to Generals Porter and Sigel the positions they were to occupy, sent instructions to General Sumner, and at a late hour of the night re turned to Washington. Next day I rode to the front of Alexandria, and was engaged in rectifying the positions of the troops, and giving orders necessary to secure the issuing of the necessary supplies, &c. I felt sure on this day that we could repulse any attack made by the enemy on the south side of the Potomac. On the 3d the enemy had disappeared from the front of Washington, and the information which I received induced me to believe that he intended to cross the upper Potomac into Maryland. This materially changed the aspect of affairs, and enlarged the sphere of operations; for, in case of a crossing in force, an active campaign would be necessary to cover Baltimore, prevent the invasion ot Pennsylvania, and clear Maryland. I therefore, on the third, ordered the 2d and 12th corps to Tenallytown, and the 9th corps to a point on the Seventh street road near Washington, and"], [193, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 185 sent such cavalry as was available to the fords .near Poolsville, to watch and impede the enemy in any attempt to cross in that vicinity. On September 5, the 2d and 12th corps were moved to Rockville, and Couch's division (the only one of the 4th corps that had been brought from the Peninsula) to Offut's cross-roads. On the 6ih the 1st and 9th corps were ordered to Leeshurg; the 6th corps, and Sykes's division of the 5th corps, to Tenallytown. On the 7th the 6th corps was advanced to Rockville, to which place my head quarters were moved on the same day. All the necessary arrangements for the defence of the city, under the new condition of things, had been made, and General Banks was left in command, having received his instructions from me. It will be seen from what has preceded that I lost no time that could be avoided in moving the army of the Potomac from the Peninsula to the support of the army of Virginia ; that I spared no effort to hasten the embarcation of the troops at Fort Monroe, Newport News and Yorktown, remaining at Fort Monroe myself until the mass of the army had sailed ; and that, after my arri val at Alexandria, I left nothing in my power undone to forward supplies and re-enforcements to General Pope. I sent, with the troops that moved, all the cavalry I could get hold of. Even my personal escort was sent out upon the line of the railway as a guard, with the provost and camp guards at headquar ters, retaining less than one hundred men, many of whom were orderlies, inva lids, members of bands, &c. All the headquarters teams that arrived were sent out with supplies and ammunition, none being retained even to move the head quarters camp. The squadron that habitually served as my personal escort was left at Falmouth with General Burnside, as he was deficient in cavalry. I left Washington on the 7th of September. At this time it was known that the mass of the rebel army had passed up the south side of the Potomac in the direction of Leesburg, and that a portion of that army had crossed into Mary land ; but whether it was their intention to cross their whole force with a view to turn Washington by a flank movement down the north bank of the Potomac, to move on Baltimore, or to invade Pennsylvania, were questions which, at that time, we had no means of determining. This uncertainty as to the intentions of the enemy obliged me, up to the 13th of September, to march cautiously and to advance the army in such order as continually to keep Washington and Balti more covered, and at the same time to hold the troops well in hand so as to be able to concentrate and follow rapidly if the enemy took the direction of Penn sylvania ; or to return to the defence of Washington, if, as was greatly feared by the authorities, the enemy should be merely making a feint with a small force to draw off our army, while with their main forces they stood ready to seize the first favorable opportunity to attack the capital. In the mean time the process of re-organization, rendered necessary after the demoralizing effects of the disastrous campaign upon the other side of the Poto mac, was rapidly progressing ; the troops were regaining confidence, and their former soldierly appearance and discipline were fast returning. My cavalry was pushed out continually in all directions, and all possible steps were taken to learn the positions and movements of the enemy. The following table shows the movements of the army, from day to day, up to the 14th of September:"], [194, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN, 186 The right wing, consisting of the 1st and 9th corps, under the command of Major General Burnside, moved on Frederick ; the 1st corps via Brooksville, Cooksville and Ridgeville, and the 9th corps via Damascus and New Market. The 2d and 12th corps, forming the centre, under the command of General Sumner, moved on Frederick; the former via Clarksburg and Urbana, the 12th corps on a lateral road between Urbana and New Market, thus maintaining the communication with the right wing, and covering the direct road from Frede rick to Washington. The 6th corps, under the command of General Franklin, moved to Buckeystown via Darnstown, Dawsonville and Barnsville, covering the road from the mouth of the Monocacy to Rockville, and being in a position to connect with and support the centre, should it have been necessary (as was supposed) to force the line of the Monocacy. Couch's division moved by the \" river road,\" covering that approach, watch ing the fords of the Potomac, and ultimately following and supporting the 6th corps. The following extracts from telegrams, received by me after my departure from Washington, will show how little was known there about the enemy's movements, and the fears which were entertained for the safety of the capital. On the 9th of September, General Halleck telegraphed me as follows : \" Until we can get better advices about the numbers of the enemy at Drains ville, I think we must be very cautious about stripping, too much, the forts on the Virginia side. It may be the enemy's object to draw off the mass of our forces and then attempt to attack from the Virginia side of the Potomac. Think of this.\" Again, on the 11th of September, General Halleck telegraphed me as follows : September 4. September 6. September 9. September 10.

I think the main force of the enemy is in your front ; more troops can be spared from here.\" This despatch, as published by the Committee on the Conduct of the \"War, and furnished by the general-in-chief, reads as follows : \"Why not order forward Porter's corps or Sigel's ; If the main force of the enemy is in your front, more troops can be spared from here.\" I remark that the original despatch, as received by me from the telegraph operator, is in the words quoted above, \" I think the main force of the enemy,\" &c. In accordance with this suggestion I asked, on the same day, that all the troops that could be spared should at once be sent to re-enforce me, but none oame. On the 1 2th I received the following telegram from his excellency the Presi dent : \" Governor Curtin telegraphs me, 'I have advices that Jackson is cross ing the Potomac at Williamsport, and probably the whole rebel army will be drawn from Maryland.' \" The President adds : \" Receiving nothing from Har per's Ferry or Martinsburg to-day, and positive information from Wheeling that the line is cut, corroborates the idea that the enemy is re-crossing the Potomac. Please do not let him get off without being hurt.\" On the 13th General Halleck telegraphed as follows : \" Until you know more certainly the enemy's force south of the Potomac, you are wrong in thus uncov ering the capital. I am of the opinion that the enemy will send a small column towards Pennsylvania to draw your forces in that direction, then suddenly move on Washington with the forces south of the Potomac and those he may cross over.\" Again, on the 14th, General Halleck telegraphed me that \" scouts re port a large force still on the Virginia side of the Potomac. If so, I fear you are exposing your left and rear.\" Again, as late as the 16th, after we had the most positive evidence that Lee's entire army was in front of us, I received the following : \"War Department, \" September 16, 1862\u2014 12.3 m. \"Tours of 7 a. m. is this moment received. As you give me no information in regard to the position of your forces, except that at Sharpsburg, of course I can not advise. I think, however, you will find that the whole force of the enemy in your front has crossed the river ; I fear now more than ever that they will re-croas at Harper's Ferry, or below, and turn your left, thus cutting you off from Washington. This has appeared to me to be a part of their plan, and hence my anxiety on the subject ; a heavy rain might prevent it. \"H. W. HALLECK, \" General-in-Chief. \"Major General McClellan.\" The importance of moving with all due caution, so as not to uncover the na tional capital until the enemy's position and plans were developed, was, I believe, fully appreciated by me; and as my troops extended from the Baltimore and Ohio railroad to the Potomac, with the extreme left flank moving along that stream, and with strong pickets left in rear to watch and guard all the available fords, I did not regard my left or rear as in any degree exposed. But it ap pears from the foregoing telegrams that the general-in-chief was of a different opinion, and that my movements were, in bis judgment, too precipitate, not only for the safety of Washington, but also for the security of my left and rear. The precise nature of these daily injunctions against a precipitate advance may now be perceived. The general-in-chief, in his testimony before the Com mittee on the Conduct of the War, says : \" In respect to General McClellan going"], [196, "188 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. too fast or too slow from Washington, there can he found no such telegram from me to him. He had mistaken the meaning of the telegrams I sent him. I tele graphed him that he was going too far, not from Washington, but from the Po tomac, leaving General Lee the opportunity to come down the Potomac and get between him and Washington. I thought General McClellan should keep more on the Potomac, and press forward his left rather than his right, so as the more readily to relieve Harper's Ferry.\" As I can find no telegram from the general-in-chief recommending me to keep my left flank nearer the Potomac, I am compelled to believe that when he gave this testimony he had forgotten the purport of the telegrams above quoted, and had also ceased to remember the fact, well known to him at the time, that my left, from the time I left Washington, always rested on the Potomac, and my centre was continually in position to re-enforce the left or right, as occasion might require. Had I advanced my left flank along the Potomac more rapidly than the other columns marched upon the roads to the right, I should have thrown that flank out of supporting distance of the other troops, and greatly exposed it. And if I had marched the entire army in one column along the bank of the river instead of upon five different parallel roads, the column, with its trains, would have extended about fifty miles, and the enemy might have defeated the advance before the rear could have reached the scene of action. Moreover, such a movement would have uncovered the communications with Baltimore and Washington on our right, and exposed our right and rear. I presume it will be admitted by every military man that it was necessary to move the army in such order that it could at any time he concentrated for battle; and I am of opinion that this object could not have been accomplished in any other way than the one employed. Any other disposition of our forces would have subjected them to defeat in detached fragments. On the 10th of September I received from my scouts information which ren dered it quite probable that General Lee's army was in the vicinity of Frederick, but whether his intention was to move towards Baltimore or Pennsylvania was not then known. On the 11th I ordered General Burnside to push a strong reconnoissance across the National road and the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, to wards New Market, and, if he learned that the enemy had moved towards Hagerstown, to press on rapidly to Frederick, keeping his troops constantly ready to meet the enemy in force. A corresponding movement of all the troops in the centre and on the left was ordered in the direction of Urbana and Pools ville. On the 12th a portion of the right wing entered Frederick, after a brisk skir mish at the outskirts of the city and in the streets. On the 13th the main bodies of the right wing and centre passed through Frederick. It was soon ascertained that the main body of the enemy's forces had marched out of the city on the two previous days, taking the roads to Boonsboro' and Harper's Ferry, thereby rendering it necessary to force the passes through the Catoctin and South Mountain ridges, and gain possession of Boonsboro' and Rohrersville before any relief could be extended to Colonel Miles at Harper's Ferry. On the 13th an order fell into my hands, issued by General Lee, which fully disclosed his plans, and I immediately gave orders for a rapid and vigorous for ward movement. The following is a copy of the order referred to : \"SPECIAL ORDERS No. 191. \"Headquarters Army of Northern Virginia, \" September 9, 1862. \" The army will resume its march to-morrow, taking the Hagerstown road.

Hunter was president, which convened at Washington for the purpose of investigating the conduct of certain officers in connexion with the surrender of Harper's Ferry, 1 find the following: \"The commission has remarked freely on Colonel Miles, an old officer, who has been killed in the service of his country, and it cannot, from any motives of delicacy, refrain from censuring those in high command when it thinks such cen sure deserved. \"The general-in-chief has testified that General McClellan, after having received orders to repel the enemy invading the State of Maryland, marched only six miles per day, on an average, when pursuing this invading army. \"The general-in-chief also testifies that, in his opinion, he could and should have relieved and protected Harper's Ferry, and in this opinion the commission fully concur.\" I have been greatly surprised that this commission, in its investigations, never called upon me, nor upon any officer of my staff, nor, so far as 1 know, upon any officer of the army of the Potomac able to give an intelligent state-"], [198, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 190 ment of the movements of that army. But another paragraph in the same report makes testimony from such sources quite superfluous. It is as follows : \" By a reference to the evidence it will be seen that, at the very moment Colonel Ford abandoned Maryland heights, his little army was in reality relieved by Generals Franklin's and Sumner's corps at Crampton's gap, within seven miles of his position.\" The corps of Generals Franklin and Sumner were a part of the army which I at that time had the honor to command, and they were acting under my orders at Crampton's gap and elsewhere ; and if, as the commission states, Colonel Ford's \"little army was in reality relieved\" by those officers, it was relieved by me. I had, on the morning of the 10th, sent the following despatch in relation to the command at Harper's Ferry : \"Camp near Rockvillr, \" September 10, 1862 \u2014 9.45 a. m. \" Colonel Miles is at or near Harper's Ferry, as I understand, with nine thou sand troops. He can do nothing where he is, but could be of great service if ordered to join me. I suggest that he be ordered to join me by the most prac ticable route. \"GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General. \" Major General Halleck, \"Washington, D. C.\" To this I received the following reply : \" There is no way for Colonel Miles to join you at present ; his only chance is to defend his works till you can open communication with him. ' \"H. W. HALLECK.\" \"George B. McClellan, Major General.\" It seems necessary, for a distinct understanding of this matter, to state that I was directed on the 12th to assume command of the garrison of Harper's Ferry as soon as I should open communications with that place, and that when I re ceived this order all communication from the direction in which I was approach ing was cut off. Up to that time, however, Colonel Miles could, in my opinion, have marched his command into Pennsylvania, by crossing the Potomac at Wil liamsport or above ; and this opinion was confirmed by the fact that Colonel Davis marched the cavalry part of Colonel Miles's command from Harper's Ferry on the 14th, taking the main road to Hagerstown, and he encountered no enemy except a small picket near the mouth of the Antietam. Before I left Washington, and when there certainly could have been no enemy to prevent the withdrawal of the forces of Colonel Miles, I recommended to the proper authorities that the garrison of Harper's Ferry should be with drawn via Hagerstown, to'aid in covering the Cumberland valley; or that, taking up the pontoon bridge and obstructing the railroad bridge, it should fall back to the Maryland heights, and there hold out to the last. In this position it ought to have maintained itself for many days. It was not deemed proper to adopt either of these suggestions, and when the matter was left to my discretion it was too late for me to do anything but endeavor to relieve the garrison. I accordingly directed artillery to be fired by our advance at frequent intervals as a signal that relief was at hand. This was done, and, as I afterwards learned, the reports of the cannon were distinctly heard at Har per's Ferry. It was confidently expected that Colonel Miles would hold out until we had carried the mountain passes, and were in condition to send a de-"], [199, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 191 tachment to his relief. The left was therefore ordered to move through Cramp ton's pass in front of Burkettsville, while the centre and right marched upon Turner's pass in front of Middletown. It may be asked by those who are not acquainted with the topography of the country in the vicinity of Harper's Ferry, why Franklin, instead of march ing his column over the circuitous road from Jefferson via Burkettsville and Brownsville, was not ordered to move along the direct turnpike to Knoxville, and thence up the river to Harper's Ferry. It was for the reason that I had received information that the enemy were anticipating our approach in that direction, and had established batteries on the south side of the Potomac which commanded all the approaches to Knoxville; moreover the road from that point winds directly along the river bank at the foot of a precipitous mountain, where there was no opportunity of forming in line of battle, and where the enemy could have placed batteries on both sides of the river to enfilade our narrow approaching columns. The approach through Crampton's pass, which debouches into Pleasant val ley in rear of Maryland heights, was the only one which afforded any reasona ble prospect of carrying that formidable position ; at the same time, the troops upon that road were in better relation to the main body of our forces. On the morning of the 14th a verbal message reached me from Colonel Miles, which was the first authentic intelligence I had received as to the condition of things at Harper's Ferry. The messenger informed me that on the preceding afternoon Maryland heights had been abandoned by our troops after repelling an attack of the rebels, and that Colonel Miles's entire force was concentrated at Harper's Ferry, the Maryland, Loudon, and Bolivar heights having been abandoned by him, and occupied by the enemy. The messenger also stated that there was no apparent reason for the abandonment of the Maryland heights, and that Colonel Miles instructed him to say that he could hold out with certainty two days longer. I directed him to make his way back, if possible, with the information that I was approaching rapidly, and felt confident I could relieve the place. On the same afternoon I wrote the following letter to Colonel Miles, and despatched three copies by three different couriers on different routes. I did not, however, learn that any of these men succeeded in reaching Harper's Ferry : \" Middletown, September 14, 1862. \"Colonel : The army is being rapidly concentrated here. We are now at tacking the pass on the Hagerstown road over the Blue ridge. A column is about attacking the Burkettsville and Boonsboro' pass. You may count on our making every effort to relieve you. You may rely upon my speedily accomplish ing that object. Hold out to the last extremity. If it is possible, reoccupy the Maryland heights with your whole force. If you can do that, I will certainly be able to relieve you. As the Catoctin valley is in our possession, you can safely cross the river at Berlin or its vicinity, so far as opposition on this side of the river is concerned. Hold out to the last. \"GEORGE B.

Anderson was to move by Boonsboro' aud Rohrersville to carry the Maryland heights. The signal officers inform me that he is now in Pleasant valley. The firing shows that Miles still holds out. Long street was to move to Boonsboro', and there halt with the reserve corps ; D. H. Hill to form the rear guard ; Stuart's cavalry to bring up stragglers, &c. We have cleared out all the cavalry this side of the mountains and north of us. The last I heard from Pleasonton he occupied Middletown, after several sharp skirmishes. A division of Burnside's command started several hours ago to support him. The whole of Burnside's command, including Hooker's corps, march this evening and early to-morrow morning, followed by the corps of Sum ner and Banks, and Sykes's division, upon Boonsboro' to cany that position. Couch has been ordered to concentrate his division and join you as rapidly as possible. Without waiting for the whole of that division to join, you will move at daybreak in the morning by Jefferson and Burkettsville upon the road to Rohrers ville. I have reliable information that the mountain pass by this road is practi cable for artillery and wagons. If this pass is not occupied by the enemy in force, seize it as soon as practicable, and debouch upon Rohrersville in order to cut off the retreat of or destroy McLaws's command. If you find this pass held by the enemy in large force, make all your dispositions for the attack and commence it about half an hour after you hear severe firing at the pass on the Hagerstown pike, where the main body will attack. Having gained the pass, your duty will be first to cut off, destroy, or capture McLaws's command and relieve Colonel Miles. If you effect this you will order him to join you at once with all his disposable troops, first destroying the bridges over the Potomac, if not already done, and, leaving a sufficient garrison to prevent the enemy from passing the ford, you will then return by Rohrersville on the direct road to Boonsboro', if the main column has not succeeded in its attack. If it has succeeded, take the road to Rohrersville, to Sharpsburg and Williamsport, in order either to cut off the retreat of Hill and Longstreet towards the Potomac, or prevent the repassage of Jackson. My general idea is to cut the enemy in two and beat him in detail. I believe I have sufficiently explained my intentions. I ask of you, at this im portant moment, all your intellect and the utmost activity that a general can exercise. \"GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General Commanding. \"Major General W. B.

M'CLELLAN. 193 General Franklin pushed his corps rapidly forward towards Crampton's pass, and at about 12 o'clock on the 14th arrived at Burkettsville, immediately in rear of which he found the enemy's infantry posted in force on both sides of the road, with artillery in strong positions to defend the approaches to the pass. Slo cum's division was formed upon the right of the road leading through the gap, and Smith's upon the left. A line formed of Bartlett's and Torbett's brigades, supported by Newton, whose activity was conspicuous, advanced steadily upon the enemy at a charge on the right. The enemy were driven from their posi tion at the base of the mountain, where they were protected by a stone wall, steadily forced back up the slope until they reached the position of their battery on the road, well up the mountain. There they made a stand. They were, however, driven back, retiring their artillery in echelon until, after an action of three hours, the crest was gained, and the enemv hastily fled down the mountain on the other side. On the left of the road, Brooks's and Irvin's brigades, of Smith's division, formed for the protection of Slocum's flank, charged up the mountain in the same steady manner, driving the enemy before them until the crest was carried. Four hundred prisoners from seventeen different organizations, seven hundred stand of arms, one piece of artillery, and three colors, were captured by our troops in this brilliant action. It was conducted by General Franklin in all its details. These details are given in a report of General Franklin, herewith sub mitted, and due credit awarded to the gallant officers and men engaged. The loss in General Franklin's corps was one hundred and fifteen killed, four hundred and sixteen wounded, and two missing. The enemy's loss was about the same. The enemy's position was such that our artillery could not be used with any effect. The close of the action found General Franklin's advance in Pleasant valley on the night of the 14th, within three and a half miles of the point on Maryland heights where he might, on the same night or on the morn ing of the loth, have formed a junction with the garrison of Harper's Ferry had it not been previously withdrawn from Maryland heights, and within six miles of Harper's Ferry. On the night of the 14th the following despatch was sent to General Frank lin : \" Bolivar, September 15 \u2014 1 a. m. \"General: * * * * * . * * * \" The commanding general directs that you occupy, with your command, the road from Rohrersville to Harper's Ferry, placing a sufficient force at Rohrers ville to hold that position in case it should be attacked by the enemy from Boons boro'.

Should you succeed in opening communication with Colonel Miles, direct him to join you with his whole command, with all the guns and public property that he can carry with him. The remainder of the guns will be spiked or destroyed; the rest of the public property will also be destroyed. You will then pro ceed to Boonsboro', which place the commanding general intends to attack to morrow, and join the main body of the army at that place; should you find, however, that the enemy have retreated from Boonsboro' towards Sharpsburg, you will endeavor to fall upon him and cut off his retreat. \" By command of Major General McClellan.

The enemy is in large force in my front, in two lines of battle stretching across the valley, and a large column of artillery and infantry on the right of the valley looking towards Harper's Ferry. They outnumber me two to one. It will of course not answer to pursue the enemy under these circumstances. I shall commu nicate with Burnside as soon as possible. In the mean time I shall wait here until I learn what is the prospect of re-enforcement. I have not the force to justify an attack on the force I see in front. I have had a very close vi to it, and its position is very strong. \" Respectfully, \"W. B. FRANKLIN, \" Major General. \"General G. B. McClellan, Commanding.\" Colonel Miles surrendered Harper's Ferry at 8 a. m. on the 15th, as the ces sation of the firing indicated, aud General Franklin was ordered to remain where he was to watch the large force in front of him, and protect our left and rear until the night of the 16th, when he was ordered to join the main body of the army at Keedysville, after sending Couch's division to Maryland heights. While the events which have just been described were taking place at Cramp ton's gap the troops of the centre and right wing, which had united at Frederick on the 13th, were engaged in the contest for the possession of Turner's gap. On the moruing of the 13th General Pleasonton was ordered to send Mc- Reynolds's brigade and a section of artillery in the direction of Gettysburg, and Rush's regiment towards Jefferson to communicate with Franklin, to whom the 6th United States cavalry and a section of artillery had previously been sent, and to proceed with the remainder of his force in the direction of Middle town in pursuit of the enemy. After skirmishing with the enemy all the morning, and driving them from sev eral strong positions, he reached Turner's gap of the South mountain in the after noon, and found the enemy in force and apparently determined to defend the pass. He sent back for infantry to General Burnside, who had been directed to support him, and proceeded to make a reconnoissance of the position. The South mountain is at this point about one thousand feet in height, and its general direction is from northeast to southwest. The national road from Fred-"], [203, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN 195 erick to Hagerstown crosses it nearly at right angles through Turner's gap, a depression which is some four hundred feet in depth. The mountain on the north side of the turnpike is divided into two crests, or ridges, by a narrow valley, which, though deep at the pass, becomes a slight depression at about a mile to the north. There are two country roads, one to the right of the turnpike and the other to the left, which give access to the crests overlooking the main road. The one on the left, called the \"Old Sharpsburg road,\" is nearly parallel to and about half a mile distant from the turnpike, until it reaches the crest of the mountain, when it bends off to the left. The other road, called the \"Old Hagerstown road,\" passes up a ravine in the mountains about a mile from the turnpike, and bending to the left over and along the first crest, enters the turnpike at the Mountain House, near the summit of the pass. On the night of the 13th the positions of the different corps were as follows : Reno's corps at Middletown, except Redman's division at Frederick. Hooker's corps on the Monocacy, two miles from Frederick. Sumner's corps near Frederick. Banks's corps near Frederick. Sykes's division near Frederick. Franklin's corps at Buckeystown. Couch's division at Licksville. The orders from headquarters for the march on the 14th were as follows : 13th, 11.30 p. m. \u2014 Hooker to march at daylight to Middletown. 13th, 11.30 p. m. \u2014 Sykes to move at 6 a. m. after Hooker, on the Middletown and Hagerstown road. 14th, 1 a. m. \u2014 Artillery reserve to follow Sykes closely. 13th, 8.45 p. m. \u2014 Turner to move at 7 a. m. 14th, 9 a. m. \u2014 Sumner ordered to take the Shookstown road to Middletown. 13th, 6.45 p. m. \u2014 Couch ordered to move to Jefferson with his whole division. On the 14th General Pleasonton continued his reconnoissance. Gibson's bat- tery and afterwards Benjamin's battery (of Reno's corps) were placed on high ground to the left of the turnpike, and obtained a direct fire on the enemy's position in the gap. General Cox's division, which had been ordered up to support General Pleas onton, left its bivouac, near Middletown, at 6 a. m. The 1st brigade reached the scene of action about 9 a. m., and was sent up the old Sharpsburg road by General Pleasonton to feel the enemy and ascertain if he held the crest on that. side in strong force. This was soon found to be the case; and General Cox having arrived with the other brigade, and information having been received from General Reno that the column would be supported by the whole corps, the division was ordered to assault the position. Two 20-pounder Parrotts of Sim mons's battery and two sections of McMullan's battery were left in the rear in position near the turnpike, where they did good service during the day against the enemy's batteries in the gap. Colonel Scammon's brigade was deployed, aud, well cohered by skirmishers, moved up the slope to the left of the road with the object of turning the enemy's right, if possible. It succeeded in gaining the crest and establishing itself there, in spite of the vigorous efforts of the enemy, who was posted behind stone walls and in the edges of timber, and the fire of a battery which poured in canister and case shot on the regiment on the right of the brigade. Colonel Crooke's brigade marched in columns at support ing distance. A section of McMullan's battery, under Lieutenant Croonve, (killed while serving one of his guns,) was moved up with great difficulty, and opened with canister at very short range on the enemy's infantry, by whom (after having done considerable execution) it was soon silenced and forced to withdraw. One regiment of Crook'* brigade was now deployed on Scammon's left, and"], [204, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 196 the other two in his rear, and they several times entered the first line and re lieved tire regiments in front of them when hard pressed. A section of Sum ner's battery was brought up and placed in the open space in the woods, where it did good service during the rest of the day. The enemy several times attempted to retake the crest, advancing with bold ness, but were each time repulsed. They then withdrew their battery to a point more to the right, and formed columns on both our flanks. It was now about noon, and a lull occurred in the contest which lasted about two hours, during which the rest of the corps was coming up. General Wilcox's division was the first to arrive. When he reached the base of the mountain, General Cox advised him to consult General Pleasonton as to a position. The latter indicated that on the right, afterwards taken up by General Hooker. General Wilcox was in the act of moving to occupy this ground, when he received an order from General Reno to move up the old Sharpsburg road and take a position to its right, overlooking the turnpike. Two regiments were detached to support General Cox, at his request. One section of Cooke's battery was placed in po sition near the turn of the road, (on the crest,) and opened fire on the enemy's batteries across the gap. The division was proceeding to deploy to the right of the road, when the enemy suddenly opened (at one hundred and fifty yards) with a battery which enfiladed the road at this point, drove off Cook's cannon eers with their limbers, and caused a temporary panic in which the guns were nearly lost. But the 79th New York and 17th Michigan promptly rallied, changed front under a heavy fire, and moved out to protect the guns with which Captain Cook had remained. Order was soon restored, and the division formed in line on the right of Cox, and was kept concealed as much as possible under the hillside until the whole line advanced. It was exposed not only to the fire of the battery in front, but also to that of the batteries on the other side of the turnpike, and lost heavily. Shortly before this time Generals Burnside and Reno arrived at the base of the mountain ; and the former directed the latter to move up the divisions of Generals Sturgis and Rodman to the crest held by Cox and Wilcox, and to move upon the enemy's position with his whole force as soon as he was in formed that General Hooker (who had just been directed to attack on the right) was well advanced up the mountain. General Reno then went to the front and assumad the direction of affairs, the positions having been explained to him by General Pleasonton. Shortly be fore this time I arrived at the point occupied by General Burnside, and my headquarters were located there until the conclusion of the action. General Sturgis had left his camp at I p. m., and reached the scene of action about 3J p. m. Clark's battery, of his division, was sent to assist Cox's left, by order of General Reno, and two regiments (2d Maryland and 6th New Hampshire) were detached by General Reno and sent forward a short distance on the left of the turnpike. His division was formed in rear of Wilcox's, and Rodman's division was divided ; Colonel Fairchilds's brigade being placed on the extreme left, and Colonel Harland's, under General Rodman's personal supervision, on the right. My order to move the whole line forward and take or silence the enemy's batteries in front was executed with enthusiasm. The enemy made a desperate resistance, charging our advancing lines with fierceness, but they were every where routed and fled. Our chief loss was in Wilcox's division. The enemy's battery was found to be across a gorge and beyond the reach of our infantry ; but its position was made untenable, and it was hastily removed and not again put in position near us. But the batteries across the gap still kept up a fire of shot and shell. General Wilcox praises very highly the conduct of the 17th Michigan in this advance\u2014 a regiment which had been organized scarcely a month, but which"], [205, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B M'CLELLAN. 197 charged the advancing enemy in flank in a manner worthy of veteran troops ; andalso that of the 45th Pennsylvania, which bravely met them in front. Cook's battery now reopened fire. Sturgis's division was moved to the front of Wilcox's, occupying the new ground gained on the further side of the slope, and his artillery opened on the batteries across the gap. The enemy made an effort to turn our left about dark, but were repulsed by Fairchilds's brigade and Clark's battery. At about 7 o'clock the enemy made another effort to regain the lost ground, attacking along Sturgis's front and part of Cox's. A lively fire was kept up until nearly 9 o'clock, several charges being made by the enemy and repulsed with slaughter, and we finally occupied the highest part of the mountain. General Reno was killed just before sunset, while making a reconnoissance to the front, and the command of the corps devolved upon General Cox. In General Reno the nation lost one of its best general officers. He was a skilful soldier, a brave and honest man. There was no firing after 10 o'clock, and the troops slept on their arms ready to renew the fight at daylight; but the enemy quietly retired from our front during the night, abandoning their wounded, and leaving their dead in large numbers scattered over the field. While these operations were progressing on the left of the main column, the right under General Hooker was actively en gaged. His corps left the Monocacy early in the morning, and its advance reached the Catoctin creek about 1 p. m. General Hooker then went forward to examine the ground. At about 1 o'clock General Meade's division was ordered to make a diversion in favor of Reno. The following is the order sent : \" September 14 \u2014 1 p. m. \" General: General Reno requests that a division of yours may move up on the right (north) of the main road. General McClellan desires you to coin ply with this request, holding your whole corps in readiness to support the movement, and taking charge of it yourself. \" Sumner's and Banks's corps have commenced arriving. Let General McClellan be informed as soon as you commence your movement. \"GEORGE D. RUGGLES, \"Colonel, Assistant Adjutant General, and Aide-de-Camp. \" Major General Hooker.\" Meade's division left Catoctin creek about two o'clock, and turned off to the right from the main road on the old Hagerstown road to Mount Tabor church, where General Hooker was, and deployed a short distance in advance, its right resting about one and a half mile from the turnpike. The enemy fired a few shots from a battery on the mountain side, but did no considerable damage. Cooper's battery \"B,\" 1st Pennsylvania artillery, was placed in position on high ground at about three and a half o'clock, and fired at the enemy on the slope, but soon ceased by order of General Hooker, and the position of our lines pre vented any further use of artillery by us on this part of the field. The first Massachusetts cavalry was sent up the valley to the right to observe the move ments, if any, of the enemy in that direction, and one regiment of Meade's division was posted to watch a road coming in the same direction. The other divisions were deployed as they came up, General Hatch's on the left, and General Ricketts's, which arrived at 5 p. m., in the rear. General Gibbon's brigade was detached from Hatch's division by General Burnside, for the purpose of making a demonstration on the enemy's centre, up the main road, as soon as the movements on the right and left had sufficiently progressed. The 1st Pennsylvania rifles of General Seymour's brigade were sent forward as skirmishers to feel the enemy, and it was found that he was in force. Meade was then directed to advance his division to the right of the road, so as to out-"], [206, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 198 flank them if possible\", and then to move forward and attack, while Hatch was directed to take with his division the crest on the left of the old Hagerstown road, Ricketts's division being held in reserve. Seymour's brigade was sent up to the top of the slope, on the right-of the ravine through which the road runs; and then moved along the summit parallel to the road, while Colonel Gal lagher's and Colonel Magilton's brigades moved in the same direction along the slope and in the ravine. The ground was of the most difficult character for the movement of troops, the hillside being very steep and rocky, and obstructed by stone walls and timber. The enemy was very soon encountered, and in a short time the action became general along the whole front of the division. The line advanced steadily up the mountain side, where the enemy was posted behind trees and rocks, from which he was gradually dislodged. During this advance Colonel Gallagher, commanding 3d brigade, was severely wounded; and the command devolved upon Lieutenant Colonel Robert Anderson. General Meade having reason to believe that the enemy were attempting to ontflank him on his right, applied to General Hooker for re-enforcements. General Duryea's brigade of Ricketts's division was ordered up, but it did not arrive until the close of the action. It was advanced on Seymour's left, but only one regiment could open fire before the enemy retired and darkness inter vened. General Meade . speaks highly of General Seymour's skill in handling his brigade on the extreme right, securing by his man\u0153uvres the great object of the movement, the outflanking of the enemy. While General Meade was gallantly driving the enemy on the right, Gen eral Hatch's division was engaged in a severe contest for the possession of the crest on the left of the ravine; it moved up the mountain in the following order: two regiments of General Patrick's brigade deployed as skirmishers, with the other two regiments of the same brigade supporting them ; Colonel Phelps's brigade in line of battalions in mass at deploying distance, General Doubleday's brigade in the same order bringing up the rear. The 21st New York having gone straight up the slope instead of around to the right, as directed, the 2d United States sharpshooters was sent out in its place. Phelps's and Doubleday's brigades were deployed in turn as they reached the woods, which began about half up the mountain. General Patrick with his skirmishers soon drew the fire of the enemy, and found him strongly posted behind a fence which bounded the cleared space on the top of the ridge, having on his front the woods through which our line was advancing, and in his rear a cornfield full of rocky ledges, which afforded good cover to fall back to if dislodged.. Phelps's brigade gallantly advanced, under a hot fire, to close quarters, and after ten or fifteen minutes of heavy firing on both sides (in which General Hatch was wounded while urging on his men) the fence was carried by a charge, and our line advanced a few yards beyond it, somewhat sheltered by the slope of the hill. Doubleday's brigade, now under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hoff man, (Colonel Wainwright having been wounded,) relieved Phelps, and continued firing for an hour and a half; the enemy behind ledges of rocks, some thirty or forty paces in our front, making a stubborn resistance, and attempting to charge on the least cessation of our- fire. About dusk Colonel Christian's brigade of Ricketts's division came up and relieved Doubleday's brigade, which fell back into line behind Phelps's. Christian's brigade continued the action for thirty or forty minutes, when the enemy retired, after having made an attempt to flank us on the left, which was repulsed by the 75th New York and 7th Indiana. The remaining brigade of Ricketts's division (General Hartsuff's) was moved up in the centre, and connected Meade's left with Doubleday's right. We now had possession of the summit of the first ridge which commanded the turnpike"], [207, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 199 on both sides of the mountain, and the troops were ordered to hold their posi tions until further orders, and slept on their aims. Late in the afternoon Gen eral Gibbon, with his brigade and one section of Gibbon's battery, (B, 4th artil lery,) was ordered to move up the main road on the enemy's centre. He advanced a regiment on each side of the road, preceded by skirmishers, and followed by the other two regiments in double column ; the artillery moving on the road until within range of the enemy's guns, which were firing on the col umn from the gorge. ! The brigade advanced steadily, driving the enemy from his positions in the woods and behind stone walls, until they reached a point well up towards the top of the pass, when the enemy, having been re-enforced by three regiments, opened a heavy fire on the front and on both flanks. The fight continued until 9 o'clock, the enemy being entirely repulsed ; and the brigade, after having suffered severely, and having expended all its ammunition, including even the cartridges of the dead and wounded, continued to hold the ground it had so gallantly won until 12 o'clock, when it was relieved by General Gorman's brig ade of Sedgwick's division, Sumner's corps, (except the 6th Wisconsin, which remained on the field all night.) General Gibbon, in this delicate movement, handled his brigade with as much precision and coolness as if upon parade, and the bravery of his troops could not be excelled. The 2d corps (Sumner's) and the 12th corps (Williams's) reached their final positions shortly after dark. General Richardson's division was placed near Mount Tabor church, in a position to support our right, if necessary ; the 12th corps and Sedgwick's division bivouacked around Bolivar, in a position to sup port our centre and left. General Sykes's division of regulars and the artillery reserve halted for the night at Middletown. Thus, on the night of the 14th the whole army was massed in the vicinity of the field of battle, in readiness to renew the action the next day, or to move in pursuit of the enemy. At daylight our skirmishers were advanced, and it was found that he had retreated during the night, leaving his dead on the field, and his wounded uncared for. About fifteen hundred prisoners were taken by us during the battle, and the loss to the enemy in killed was much greater than our own, and, probably, also in wounded. It is believed that the force opposed to us at Turner's gap con sisted of D. H. Hill's corps, (15,000,) and a part, if not the whole, of Long street's, and perhaps a portion of Jackson's, probably some 30,000 in all. We went into action with about 30,000 men, and our losses amounted to 1,568 aggregate, (312 killed, 1,234 wounded, and 22 missing.) On the next day I had the honor to receive the following very kind despatch from his excellency the President : \"War Department, \" Washington, September 15, 1862 \u2014 2.45 p. m. \" Your despatch of to-day received. God bless you, and all with you ; de stroy the rebel army if possible. \"A. LINCOLN. \"Major General McClellan.\" \" antietam.\" On the night of the battle of South Mountain, orders were given to the corps commanders to press forward the pickets at early dawn. This advance revealed the fact that the enemy had left his positions, and an immediate pursuit was or dered : the cavalry, under General Pleasonton, and the three corps under Gen erals Sumner, Hooker, and Mansfield, (the latter of whom had arrived that morn ing and assumed command of the 12th, Williams's corps,) by the national turn-"], [208, "200 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. pike and Boonsboro'; the corps of Generals Burnside and Porter (the latter command at that time consisting of but one weak division, Sykes's) by the old Sharpsburg road, and General Franklin to move into Pleasant valley, occupy Rohrersville by a detachment, and endeavor to relieve Harper's Ferry. Generals Burnside and Porter, upon reaching the road from Boonsboro' to Rohrersville to re-enforce Franklin, or to move on Sharpsburg, according to cir cumstances. Franklin moved towards Brownsville and found there a force of the enemy, much superior in numbers to his own, drawn up in a strong position to receive him. At this time the cessation of firing at Harper's Ferry indicated the sur render of that place. The cavalry overtook the enemy's cavalry in Boonsboro', made a daring charge, killing and wounding a number, and capturing 250 prisoners and two guns. General Richardson's division of the 2d corps pressing the rear guard of the enemy with vigor, passed Boonsboro' and Keedysville, and came upon the main body of the enemy, occupying in large force a strong position a few miles beyond the latter place. It had been hoped to engage the enemy during the 15th. Accordingly, instruc tions were given that if the enemy were overtaken on the march they should be attacked at once; if found in heavy force and in position, the corps in ad vance should be placed in position for attack, and await my arrival. On reach ing the advanced position of our troops, I found but two divisions, Richardson's and Sykes's, in position; the other troops were halted in the road; the head of the column some distance in rear of Richardson. The enemy occupied a strong position on the heights, on the west side of Antietam creek, displaying a large force of infantry and cavalry, with numer ous batteries of artillery, which opened on our columns as they appeared in sight on the Keedysville road and Sharpsburg turnpike, which fire was returned by Captain Tidball's light battery, 2d United States artillery, and Pettit's bat tery, 1st New York artillery. The division of General Richardson, following close on the heels of the re treating foe, halted and deployed near Antietam river, on the right of the Sharps burg road. General Sykes, leading on the division of regulars on the old Sharpsburg road, came up and deployed to the left of General Richardson, on the left of the road. Antietam creek, in this vicinity, is crossed by four stone bridges \u2014 the upper one on the Keedysville and Williamsport road ; the second on the Keedysville and Sharpsburg turnpike, some two and a half miles below ; the third about a mile below the second, on the Rohrersville and Sharpsburg road ; and the fourth near the mouth of Antietam creek, on the road leading from Harper's Ferry to Sharpsburg, some three miles below the third. The stream is sluggish, with few and difficult fords. After a rapid examination of the position, I found that it was too late to attack that day, and at once directed the placing of the bat teries in position in the centre, and indicated the bivouacs for the different corps, massing them near and on both sides of the Sharpsburg turnpike. The corps were not all in their positions until the next morning after sunrise. On the morning of the 16th, it was discovered that the enemy had changed the position of his batteries. The masses of his troops, however, were still concealed behind the opposite heights. Their left and centre were upon and in front of the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike, hidden by woods and irre gularities of the ground; their extreme left resting upon a wooded eminence near the cross-roads to the north of J. Miller's farm ; their left resting upon the Potomac. Their line extended south, the right resting upon the hills to the south of Sharpsburg, near Shaveley's farm. The bridge over the Antietam, described as No. 3, near this point, was"], [209, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 201 strongly covered by riflemen protected by rifle-pits, stone fences, &c, and en filaded by artillery. The ground in front of this line consisted of undulating hills, their crests in turn commanded by others in their rear. On all favorable points the enemy's artillery was posted and their reserves hidden from view by the hills, on which their line of battle was formed, could man\u0153uvre unobserved by our army, and from the shortness of their line could rapidly re-enforce any point threatened by our attack. Their position, stretching across the angle formed by the Potomac and Antietam, their flanks and rear protected by these streams, was one of the strongest to be found in this region of country, which is well adapted to defensive warfare. i On the right, near Keedysville, on both sides of the Sharpsburg turnpike, were Sumner's and Hooker's corps. In advance, on the right of the turnpike and near the Antietam river, General Richardson's division of General Sumner's corps was posted. General Sykes's division of General Porter's corps was on the left of the turnpike and in line with General Richardson, protecting the bridge No. 2, over the Antietam. The left, of the line, opposite to and some distance from bridge No. 3, was occupied by General Burnside's corps. Before giving General Hooker his orders to make the movement which will presently be described, I rode to the left of the line to satisfy myself that the troops were property posted there to secure our left flank from any attack made aloDg the left bank of the Antietam, as well as to enable us to carry bridge No. 3. I found it necessary to make considerable changes in the position of General Burnside's corps, and directed him to advance to a strong position in the im mediate vicinity of the bridge, and to reconnoitre the approaches to the bridge carefully. In front of General Sumner's and Hooker's corps, near Keedysville, and on the ridge of the first line of hills overlooking the Antietam, and between the turnpike and Fry's house on the right of the road, were placed Captain Taft's, Langner's, Von Kleizer's and Lieutenant Weaver's batteries of twenty pounder Parrott guns. On the crest of the hill in the rear and right of bridge No. 3, Captain Weed's three-inch and Lieutenant Benjamin's twenty-pounder batteries. General Franklin's corps and General Couch's division held a posi tion in Pleasant valley, in front of Brownsville, with a strong force of the enemy in their front. General Morell's division of Porter's corps was en route from Boonsboro', and General Humphrey's division of new troops en route from Frederick, Maryland. About daylight on the 16th the enemy opened a heavy fire of artillery on our guns in position, which was promptly returned; their fire was silenced for the time, but was frequently renewed during the day. In the heavy fire of the morning, Major Arndt, commanding first battalion first New York artillery, was mortally wounded while directing the operations of his bat teries. It was afternoon before I could move the troops to their positions for attack, being compelled to spend the morning in reconnoitring the new position taken up by the enemy, examining the ground, finding fords, clearing the approaches, and hurrying up the ammunition and supply trains, which had been delayed by the rapid march of the troops over the few practicable approaches from Freder ick. These had been crowded by the masses of infantry, cavalry aud artillery pressing on with the hope of overtaking the enemy before he could form to re sist an attack. Many of the troops were out of rations on the previous day, and a good deal of their ammunition had been expended in the severe action of the 14th. My plan for the impending general engagement was to attack the enemy's left with the corps of Hooker and Mansfield, supported by Sumner's, and if necessary by Franklin's ; aud, as soon as matters looked favorably there, to move the corps of Burnside against the enemy's extreme right, upon the ridge running to the south and rear of Sharpsburg, and having carried their position, to press along the crest towards our right ; aud whenever either of these flank"], [210, "202 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. movements should be successful, to advance our centre with all the forces then disposable. About 2 p.m. General Hooker, with his corps, consisting of General Ricketts's, Meade's and Doubleday's divisions, was ordered to cross the Antietam at a ford, and at bridge No. 1, a short distance above, to attack and, if possible, turn the enemy's left. General Sumner was ordered to cross the corps of General Mans field (the 12th) during the night, and hold his own (the 2d) corps ready to cross early the next morning. On reaching the vicinity of the enemy's left a sharp contest commenced with the Pennsylvania reserves, the advance of General Hooker's corps, near the house of D. Miller. The enemy were driven from the strip of woods where he was first met. The firing lasted until after dark, when General Hooker's corps rested on their arms on ground won from the enemy. During the night General Mansfield's corps, consisting of Generals Williams's and Green's divisions, erossed the Antietam at the same ford and bridge that General Hooker's troops had passed, aud bivouacked on the farm of J. Poffen berger, about a mile in rear of General Hooker's position. At daylight on the 17th the action was commenced by the skirmishers of the Pennsylvania re serves. The whole of General Hooker's corps was soon engaged, and drove the enemy from the open field in front of the first line of woods into a second line of woods beyond, which runs to the eastward of and nefcrly parallel to the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike. This contest was obstinate, and as the troops advanced the opposition became more determined and the number of the enemy greater. General Hooker then ordered up the corps of General Mansfield, which moved promptly toward the scene of action. The first division, General Williams's, was deployed to the right on approach ing the enemy ; General Crawford's brigade on the right, its right resting on the Hagerstown turnpike ; on his left General Gordon's brigade. The second division, General Green's, joining the left of Gordon's, extended as far as the burnt buildings to the north and east of the white church on the turnpike. During the deployment, that gallant veteran General Mansfield fell mortally wounded, while examining the ground in front of his troops. General Hart suff, of Hooker's corps, was severely wounded, while bravely pressing forward his troops, and was taken from the field. The command of the twelfth corps fell upon General Williams. Five regi ments of first division of this corps were new troops. One brigade of the sec ond division was sent to support General Doubleday. The one hundred and twenty-fourth Pennsylvania volunteers were pushed across the turnpike into the woods beyond J. Miller's house, with orders to hold the position as long as possible. The line of battle of this corps was formed, and it became engaged about seven a. m., the attack being opened by Knapp's (Pennsylvania,) Cothran's (New York,) and Hampton's (Pittsburg) batteries. To meet this attack the enemy had pushed a strong column of troops into the open fields in front of the turnpike, while he occupied the woods on the west of the turnpike in strong force. The woods (as was found by subsequent observation) were traversed by outcropping ledges of rock. Several hundred yards to the right ard rear was a hill which commanded the debouche of the woods, and in the fields between was a long line of stone fences, continued by breastworks of rails, which cov ered the enemy's infantry from our musketry. The same woods formed a screen behind which his movements were concealed, and his batteries on the hdl and the rifle works covered from the fire of our artillery in front. For about two hours the battle raged with varied success, the enemy en deavoring to drive our troops into the second line of wood, and ours in turn to get possession of the line in front. Our troops ultimately succeeded in forcing the enemy back into the woods i"], [211, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 203 near the turnpike, General Green with his two brigades crossing into the woods to the left of the Dunbar church. During this conflict General Craw ford, commanding first division after General Williams took command of the corns, was wounded and left the field. General Green being much exposed and applying for re-enforcements, the thirteenth New Jersey, twenty-seventh Indiana, and the third Maryland were gent to his support with a section of Knapp's battery. At about nine o'clock a. m. General Sedgwick's division of General Sumner's corps arrived. Crossing the ford previously mentioned, this division marched in three columns to the support of the attack on the enemy's left. On Hear ing the scene of action the columns were halted, faced to the front, and estab lished by General Sumner in three parallel lines by brigade, facing toward the south and west ; General Gorman's brigade in front, General Dana's second, and General Howard's third, with a distance between the lines of some seventy paces. The division was then put in motion and moved upon the field of battle, under fire from the enemy's concealed batteries on the hill beyond the roads. Passing diagonally to the front across the open space and to the front of the first division of General Williams's corps, this latter division with drew. Entering the woods on the west of the turnpike, and driving the enemy be fore them, the first line was met by a heavy fire of musketry' and shell from the enemy's breastworks and the batteries on the hill commanding the exit from the woods ; meantime a heavy column of the enemy had succeeded in crowd ing back the troops of General Green's division, and appeared in rear of the left of Sedgwick's division. By command of General Sumner, General Howard faced the third line to the rear preparatory to a change of front to meet the column advancing on the left ; but this line now suffering from a destructive fire both in front and on its left, which it was unable to return, gave way to wards the right and rear in considerable confusion, and was soon followed by the first and second lines. General Gorman's brigade, and one regiment of General Dana's, soon rallied and checked the advance of the enemy on the right. The second and third lines now formed on the left of General Gorman's brigade, and poured a destruc tive fire upon the enemy. During General Sumner's attack, he ordered General Williams to support him. Brigadier General Gordon, with a portion of his brigade, moved forward, but when he reached the woods, the left of General Sedgwick's division had given way ; and finding himself, as the smoke cleared up, opposed to the enemy in force with his small command, he withdrew to the rear of the batteries at the second line of woods. As General Gordon's troops unmasked our batteries on the left, they opened with canister; the batteries of Captain Cothran, 1st New York, and I, 1st artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Woodruff, doing good ser vice. Unable to withstand this deadly fire in front and the musketry fire from the right, the enemy again sought shelter in the woods and rocks beyond the turnpike. During this assault Generals Sedgwick and Dana were seriously wounded and taken from the field. General Sedgwick, though twice wounded, and faint from loss of blood, retained command of his division for more than an hour after his first wound, animating his command by his presence. About the time of General Sedgwick's advance, General Hooker, while urg ing on his command, was severely wounded in the foot and taken from the field, and General Meade was placed in command of his corps. General Howard as sumed command after General Sedgwick retired. The repulse of the enemy offered opportunity to rearrange the lines and re organize the commands on the right, now more or less in confusion. The bat teries of the Pennsylvania reserve, on high ground, near J. Poffenberger s house,"], [212, "204 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. opened fire, and checked several attempts of the enemy to establish batteries n front of our right, to turn that flank and enfilade the lines. While the conflict was so obstinately raging on the right, General French was pushing his division against the enemy still further to the left. This division crossed the Antietam at the same ford as General Sedgwick, and immediately in his rear. Passing over the stream in three columns, the division marched about a mile from the ford, then facing to the left, moved in three lines towards the enemy : General Max Weber's brigade in front ; Colonel Dwight Morris's brigade of raw troops, undrilled, and moving for the first time under fire, in the second, and General Kimball's brigade in the third. The division was first as sailed by a fire of artillery, but steadily advanced, driving in the enemy's skir mishers, and encountered the infantry in some force at the group of houses on Roulette's farm. General Weber's brigade gallantly advanced with an un wavering front and drove the enemy from their position about the houses. While General Weber was hotly engaged with the first line of the enemy, General French received orders from General Sumner, his corps commander, to push on with renewed vigor to make a diversion in favor of the attack on the right. Leaving the new troops, who had been thrown into some confusion from their march through cornfields, over fences, &c, to form as a reserve, he ordered the brigade of General Kimball to the front, passing to the left of General Weber. The enemy was pressed back to near the crest of the hill, where he was encountered in greater strength posted in a sunken road forming a natural rifle-pit running in a northwesterly direction. Iu a cornfield in rear of this road were also strong bodies of the enemy. As the line reached the crest of the hill a galling fire was opened on it from the sunken road and cornfield. Here a terrific fire of musketry burst from both lines, and the battle raged along the whole line with great slaughter. The enemy attempted to turn the left of the line, hut were met by the 7th Virginia and 132d Pennsylvania volunteers and repulsed. Foiled in this, the enemy made a determined assault on the front, but were met by a charge from our lines which drove them back with severe loss, leaving in our hands some three hundred prisoners and several stand of colors. The enemy having been repulsed by the terrible execution of the batteries and the musketry fire on the extreme right, now attempted to assist the attack on General French's division by assailing him on his right and endeavoring to turn this flank, but this attack was met and checked by the 14th Indiana and 8th Ohio volunteers, and by canister from Captain Tompkins's battery, 1st Rhode Island artillery. Having been under an almost continuous fire for nearly four hours, and the ammunition nearly expended, this division now took position immediately below the crest of the heights on which they had so gallantly fought, the enemy making no at tempt to regain their lost ground. On the left of General French, General Richardson's division was hotly en gaged. Having crossed the Antietam about 9.30 a. m. at the ford crossed by the other divisions of Sumner's corps, it moved on a line nearly parallel to the Antietam, and formed in a ravine behind the high grounds overlooking Roulette's house; the 2d (Irish) brigade, commanded by General Meagher, on the right; the 3d brigade, commanded by General Caldwell, on his left, and the brigade commanded by Colonel Brooks, 53d Pennsylvania volunteers, in support. As the division moved forward to take its position on the field, the enemy directed a fire of artillery against it, but owing to the irregularities of the ground did but little damage. Meagher's brigade advancing steadily soon became engaged with the enemy posted to the left and in front of Roulette's house. It continued to advance un der a heavy fire nearly to the crest of the hill overlooking Piper's house, the enemy being posted in a continuation of the sunken road and cornfield before"], [213, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 205 referred to. Here the brave Irish brigade opened upon the enemy a terrific musketry fire. All of General Sumner's corps was now engaged : General Sedgwick on the right; General French in the centre, and General Richardson on the left. The Irish brigade sustained its well-earned reputation. After suffering terribly in officers and men, and strewing the ground with their enemies as they drove them back, their ammunition nearly expended, and their commander, General Meagher, disabled by the fall of his horse shot under him, this brigade was ordered to give place to General Caldwell's brigade, which advanced to a short distance in its rear. The lines were passed by the Irish brigade breaking by company to the rear, and General Caldwell's by company to the front as steadily as on drill. Colonel Brooks's brigade now became the second line. The ground over which General Richardson's and French's divisions were fighting was very irregular, intersected by numerous ravines, hills covered with growing corn, enclosed by stone walls, behind which the enemy could advance unobserved upon any exposed point of our lines. Taking advantage of this, the enemy attempted to gain the right of Richardson's position iu a cornfield near Roulette's house, where the division had become separated from that of General French's. A change of front by the 52d New York and 2d Delaware volunteers, of Colonel Brooks's brigade, under Colonel Frank, and the attack made by the 53d Pennsylvania volunteers, sent further to the right by Colonel Brooks to close this gap in the line, and the movement of the 1 32d Pennsyl vania and 7th Virginia volunteers of General French's division, before referred to, drove the enemy from the comfit Id and restored the line. The brigade of General Caldwell, with determined gallantry, pushed the enemy back opposite the left and centre of this division, but sheltered in the sunken road, they still held our forces on the right of Caldwell in check. Col onel Barlow, commanding the 61st and 64th New York regiments of Caldwell's brigade, seeing a favorable opportunity, advanced the regiments on the left, taking the line in the sunken road in flank, aud compelled them to surrender, capturing over three hundred prisoners and three stands of colors. The whole of the brigade, with the 57th and 66th New York regiments of Cokmel Brooks's brigade, who had moved these regiments into the first line, now advanced with gallantry, driving the enemy before them in confusion into the cornfield beyond the sunken road. The left of the division was now well ad vanced, when the enemy, concealed by an intervening ridge, endeavored to turn its left aud rear. Colonel Cross, 5th New Hampshire, by a change of front to the left and rear, brought his regiment facing the advancing line. Here a spirited contest arose to gain a commanding height, the two opposing forces moving parallel to each other, giving and receiving fire. The 5th gaining the advantage, faced to the right and delivered its volley. The enemy staggered, but rallied aud advanced desperately at a charge. Being re-enforced by the 81st Pennsylvania, these regiments met the advance by a counter charge. The enemy fled, leaving many killed, wounded, aud prisoners, and the colors of the 4th North Carolina, in our hands. Another column of the enemy, advancing under shelter of a stone wall and cornfield, pressed down on the right of the division ; but Colonel Barlow again advanced the 61st aud 64th New York against these troops, and with the attack of Kimball's brigade on the right, drove them from this position. Our troops on the left of this part of the line having driven the enemy far back, they, with re-enforced numbers, made a determined attack directly in front! To meet this, Colonel Barlow brought his two regiments to their position in line, and drove the enemy through the cornfield into the orchard beyond, under a heavy fire of musketry, and a fire of canister from two pieces of artil lery in the orchard, and a battery further to the right, throwing shell and case"], [214, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 206 shot. This advance gave us possession of Piper's house, the strong point con tended for by the enemy at this part of the line, it being a defensible building several hundred yards in advance of the sunken road. The musketry fire at this point of the line now ceased. Holding Piper's house, General Richardson withdrew the line a little way to the crest of a hill, a more advantageous posi tion. Up to this time the division was without artillery, and in the new position suffered severely from artillery fire which could not be replied to. A section of Robertson's horse battery, commanded by Lieutenant Vincent, 2d artillery, now arrived on the ground and did excellent service. Subsequently a battery of brass guns, commanded by Captain Graham. 1st artillery, arrived, and was posted on the crest of the hill, and soon silenced the two guns in the orchard. A heavy fire soon ensued between the battery further to the right and our own. Captain Graham's battery was bravely and skilfully served, but unable to reach the enemy, who had rifled guns of greater range than our smooth-bores, retired by order of General Richardson, to save it from useless sacrifice of men and horses. The brave general was himself mortally wounded while personally directing its fire. General Hancock was placed in command of the. division after the fall of General Richardson. General Meagher's brigade, now commanded by Colonel Burke, of the 63d New York, having refilled their cartridge-boxes, was again ordered forward, and took position in the centre of the line. The division now occupied one line in close proximity to the enemy, who had taken up a position in the rear of Piper's house. Colonel Dwight Morris, with the 14th Connecticut and a detachment of the 108th New York, of General French's division, was sent by General French to the support of General Richardson's division. This com mand was now placed in an interval in the line between General Caldwell's and the Irish brigades. The requirements of the extended line of battle had so engaged the artillery that the application of General Hancock for artillery for the division could not be complied with immediately by the chief of artillery or the corps commanders in his vicinity. Knowing the tried courage of the troops, General Hancock felt confident that he could hold his position, although suffering from the enemy's artillery, but was too weak to attack, as the great length of the line he .was obliged to hold prevented him from forming more than one line of battle, and, from his advanced position, this line was already partly enfiladed by the batteries of the enemy on the right, which were protected from our batteries opposite them by the woods at the Dunker church. Seeing i body of the enemy advancing on some of our troops to the left of his position, General Hancock obtained Hexamer's battery from General Frank lin's corps, which assisted materially in frustrating this attack. It also assisted the attack of the 7th Maine, of Franklin's corps, which, without other aid, made an attack against the enemy's line, and drove in skirmishers who were annoying our artillery and troops on the right. Lieutenant Woodruff, with battery I, 2d artillery, relieved Captain Hexamer, whose ammunition was expended. The enemy at one time seemed to be about making an attack in force upon this part of the line, and advanced a long column of infantry towards this division; but on nearing the position, General Pleasonton opening on them with sixteen guns, they halted, gave a desultory fire, and retreated, closing the operations on this portion of the field. I return to the incidents occurring still further to the right. Between 12 and 1 p. m. General Franklin's corps arrived on the field of battle, having left their camp near Crampton's pass at 6 a. m., leaving General Couch with orders to move with his division to occupy Maryland heights. General Smith's division led the column, followed by General Slocum's. It was first intended to keep this corps in reserve on the east side of the Antietam, to operate on either flank or on the centre, as circumstances might"], [215, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 207 require; but on nearing Keedysville, the strong opposition on the right, developed by the attacks of Hooker and Sumner, rendered it necessary at once to send this corps to the assistance of the right wing. On nearing the field, hearing that one of our batteries, (A,) 4th United States artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas, who occupied the same position as Lieutenant Woodruff's battery in the morning, was hotly engaged without supports, General Smith sent two regiments to its relief from General Hancock's brigade. On inspecting the ground, General Smith ordered the other regiments of Hancock's brigade, with Frank's and Cowen's batteries, 1st. New York artillery, to the threatened position. Lieutenant Thomas and Cap tain Cothran, commanding batteries, bravely held their positions against the advancing enemy, handling their batteries with skill. Finding the enemy still advancing, the 3d brigade, of Smith's division, com manded by Colonel Irwin, 49th Pennsylvania volunteers, was ordered up, and \"passed through Lieutenant Thomas's battery, charged upon the enemy, and drove back the advance until abreast of the Dunker church. As the right of the brigade came opposite the woods it received a destructive fire, which checked the advance and threw the brigade somewhat into confusion. It formed again behind a rise of ground in the open space in advance of the batteries. General French having reported to General Franklin that his ammunition was nearly expended, that officer ordered General Brooks, with his brigade, to re-enforce him. General Brooks formed his brigade on the right of General French, where they remained during the remainder of the day and night, fre quently under the fire of the enemy's artillery. It was soon after the brigade of Colonel Irwin had fallen back behind the rise of ground that the 7th Maine, by order of Colonel Irwin, made the gallant attack already referred to. The advance of General Franklin's corps was opportune. The attack of the enemy on this position, but for the timely arrival of his corps, must have been disastrous, had it succeeded in piercing the line between Generals Sedgwick's aud French's divisions. General Franklin ordered two brigades of General Slocum's division, General Newton's and Colonel Torbert's, to form in column to assault the woods that had been so hotly contested before by Generals Sumner and Hooker. General Bartlett's brigade was ordered to form as a reserve. At this time General Sumner, having command on the right, directed further offensive operations to be post poned, as the repulse of this, the only remaining corps avadable for attack, would peril the safety of the whole army. General Porter's corps, consisting of General Sykes's division of regulars and volunteers and General Morell's division of volunteers, occupied a position on the east side of Antietam creek, upon the main turnpike leading to Sharps burg, and directly opposite the centre of the enemy's line. This corps filled the interval between the right wing and General Burnside's command, and guarded the main approach from the enemy's position to our trains of supply. It was necessary to watch this part of our line with the utmost vigilance, lest the enemy should take advantage of the first exhibition of weakness here to push upon us a vigorous assault, for the purpose of piercing our centre and turning our rear, as well as to capture or destroy our supply trains. Once having penetrated this line, the enemy's passage to our rear could have met with but feeble resistance, as there were no reserves to re-enforce or close up the gap. Towards the middle of the afternoon, proceeding to the right, I found that Sumner's, Hooker's, and Mansfield's corps had met with serious losses. Several general officers had been carried from the field severely wounded, and the aspect of affairs was anything but promising. At the risk of greatly exposing our centre, I ordered two brigades from Porter's corps, the only avadable troops, to"], [216, "208 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. re-enforce the right. Six battalions of Sykes's regulars had been thrown for ward across the Antietam bridge on the main road to attack and drive back the enemy's sharpshooters, who were annoying Pleasonton's horse batteries in advance of the bridge; Warren's brigade, of Porter's corps, was detached to hold a position on Burnside's right and rear; so that Porter was left at one time with only a portion of Sykes's division and one small brigade of Morell's divi sion ( but little over three thousand men) to hold his important position. General Sumner expressed the most decided opinion against another attempt during that day to assault the enemy's position in front, as portions of our troops were so much scattered and demoralized. In view of these circumstances, after making changes in the position of some of the troops, I directed the different commanders to hold their positions, and being satisfied that this could be done without the assistance of the two brigades from the centre, I countermanded the order, which was in course of execution. General Slocum's division replaced a portion of General Sumner's troops, and' positions were selected for batteries in front of the woods. The enemy opened several heavy fires of artillery on the position of our troops after this, but our batteries soon silenced them. On the morning of the 17th General Pleasonton, with his cavalry division and the horse batteries, under Captains Robertson, Tidball, and Lieutenant Haines, of the 2d artillery, and Captain Gibson, 3d artillery, was ordered to advance on the turnpike towards Sharpsburg, across bridge No. 2, and support the left of General Sumner's line. The bridge being covered by a fire of artillery and sharpshooters, cavalry skirmishers were thrown out, and Captain Tidball's battery advanced by piece and drove off the sharpshooters with canister suffi ciently to establish the batteries above mentioned, which opened on the enemy with effect. The firing was kept up for about two hours, when, the enemy's fire slackening, the batteries were relieved by Randall's aud Van Reed's batteries, United States artillery. About 3 o'clock Tidball, Robertson, and Haines returned to their positions on the west of Antietam, Captain Gibson having been placed in position on the east side to guard the approaches to the bridge. These batteries did good service, concentrating their fire on the column of the enemy about to attack General Hancock's position, and compelling it to find shelter behind the hills in rear. General Sykes's division had been in position since the 15th, exposed to the enemy's artillery and \"sharpshooters. General Morell had come up on the 16th, and relieved General Richardson on the right of General Sykes. Continually, under the vigilant watch of the enemy, this corps guarded a vital point. The position of the batteries under General Pleasonton being one of great exposure, the battalion of the 2d and 10th United States infantry, under Cap tain Poland, 2d infantry, was sent to his support. Subsequently four battalions of regular infantry, under Captain Dryer, 4th infantry, were sent across to assist in driving off the sharpshooters of the enemy. The battalion of the 2d and 10th infantry, advancing far beyond the batteries, compelled the cannoneers of a battery of the enemy to abandon their guns. Few in numbers, and unsupported, they were unable to bring them off. The heavy loss of this small body of men attests their gallantry. The troops of General Burnside held the left of the line opposite bridge No. 3. The attack on the right was to have been supported by an attack on the left. Preparatory to this attack, on the evening of the 16th, General Burn side's corps was moved forward and to the left, and took up a position nearer the bridge. I visited General Burnside's position on the 16th, and after pointing out to him the proper dispositions to be made of his troops during the day and night, informed him that he would probably be required to attack the enemy's right on the following mornirg, aud directed him to make careful reconnoissances."], [217, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 209 General Burnside's corps, consisting of the divisions of Generals Cox, Wil cox, Rodman, and Sturgis, was posted as follows : Colonel Brooks's brigade, Cox's division, on the right, General Sturgis's division immediately in rear. On the left was General Rodman's division, with General Scammon's brigade, Cox's division, in support. General Wilcox's division was held in reserve. The corps bivouacked in position on the night of the 16th. Early on the morning of the 17th I ordered General Burnside to form his troops, and hold them in readiness to assault the bridge in his front, and to await further orders. At 8 o'clock an order was sent to him by Lieutenant Wilson, topographical engineers, to carry the bridge, then to gain possession of the heights beyond, and to advance along their crest upon Sharpsburg and its rear. After some time had elapsed, not hearing from him, I despatched an aid to ascertain what had been done. The aid returned with the information that but little progress had been made. I then sent him back with an order to General Burnside to assault the bridge at once, and carry it at all hazards. The aid re turned to me a second time with the report that the bridge was still in the pos session of the enemy. Whereupon I directed Colonel Sackett, inspector gen eral, to deliver to General Burnside my positive order to push forward his troops without a moment's delay, and, if necessary, to carry the bridge at the point of the bayonet ; and I ordered Colonel Sackett to remain with General Burnside and see that the order was executed promptly. After these three hours' delay, the bridge was carried at one o'clock by a brilliant charge of the 51st New York and 51st Pennsylvania volunteers. Other troops were then thrown over, and the opposite bank occupied, the enemy retreating to the heights beyond. A halt was then made by General Burnside's advance until 3 p. m., upon hearing which, I directed one of my aids, Colonel Key, to inform General Burnside that I desired him to push forward his troops with the utmost vigor, and carry the enemy's position on the heights ; that the movement was vital to our success ; that this was a time when we must not stop for loss of life, if a great object could thereby be accomplished. That if, in his judgment, his at tack would fail, to inform me so at once, that his troops might be withdrawn and used elsewhere on the field. He replied that he would soon advance, and would go up the hill as far as a battery of the enemy on the left would permit. Up on this report, I again immediately sent Colonel Key to General Burnside with orders to advance at once, if possible to flank the battery, or storm it and carry the heights ; repeating that if he considered the movement impracticable, to in form me so, that his troops might be recalled. The advance was then gallantly resumed, the enemy driven from the guns, the heights handsomely carried, and a portion of the troops even reached the outskirts of Sharpsburg. By this time it was nearly dark, and strong re-enforcements just then reaching the ene my from Harper's Ferry, attacked General Burnside's troops on their left flank, and forced them to retire to a lower line of hills nearer the bridge. If this important movement had been consummated two hours earlier, a posi tion would have been secured upon the heights, from which our batteries might have enfiladed the greater part of the enemy's line, and turned their right and rear; our victory might thus have been much more decisive. The following is the substance of General Burnside's operations as given in his report : Colonel Crook's brigade was ordered to storm the bridge. This bridge, !No. 3, is a stone structure of three arches with stone parapets. The banks of the stream on the opposite side are precipitous, and command the eastern approaches to the bridge. On the hill-side, immediately by the bridge, was a stone feuce running parallel to the stream ; the turns of the roadway, as it wound up the H. Ex. Doc. 15 14"], [218, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 210 hill, were covered by rifle-pits and breastworks of rails, &c. These works, and the woods that covered the slopes, were filled with the enemy's riflemen, and batteries were in position to enfilade the bridge and its approaches. General Rodman was ordered to cross the ford below the bridge. From Col onel Crook's position it was found impossible to carry the bridge. General Sturgis was ordered to make a detail from his division for that pur pose. He sent forward the 2d Maryland and the 6th New Hampshire. These regiments made several successive attacks in the most gallant style, hut were driven back. The artillery on the left were ordered to concentrate their fire on the woods above the bridge. Colonel Crook brought a section of Captain Simmons's bat tery to a position to command the bridge. The 51st New York and 51st Penn sylvania were then ordered to assault the bridge. Taking advantage of a small spur of the hills which ran parallel to the river, they moved towards the bridge. From the crest of this spur they rushed with bayonets fixed and cleared the bridge. The division followed the storming party, also the brigade of Colonel Crook's as a support. The enemy withdrew to still higher ground, some five or six hundred yards beyond, and opened a fire of artillery on the troops in the new position on the crest of the hill above the bridge. General Rodman's division succeeded in crossing the ford after a sharp fire of musketry and artillery, and joined on the left of Sturgis, Scammon's brigade crossing as support. General Wilcox's division was ordered across to take position on General Sturgis's right. These dispositions being completed about 3 o'clock, the command moved for ward, except Sturgis's division, left in reserve. Clark's and Durell's batteries accompanied Rodman's division ; Cook's battery with Wilcox's division, and a section of Simmons's battery with Colonel Crook's brigade. A section of Sim mons's battery and Mullenburgh's and McMullan's batteries were in position. The order for the advance was obeyed by the troops with alacrity. General Wilcox's division, with Crook in support, moved up on both sides of the turn pike leading from the bridge to Sharpsburg, General Rodman's division, sup ported by Scammon's brigade, on the left of General Wilcox. The enemy retreated before the advance of the troops. The 9th New York, of General Rodman's division, captured one of the enemy's batteries and held it for some time. As the command was driving the enemy to the main heights on the left of the town, the light division of General A. P. Hill arrived upon the field of battle from Harper's Ferry, and with a heavy artillery fire made a strong attack on the extreme left. To meet this attack the left division diverged from the line of march intended, and opened a gap between it and the right. To fill up this it was necessary to order the troops from the second line. During these movements General Rodman was mortally wounded. Colonel Harland's brigade, of General Rodman's division, was driven back. Colonel Scammon's brigade, by a change of front to rear on his right flank, saved the left from being driven completely in. The fresh troops of the enemy pouring in, and the accumulation of artillery against this command, destroyed all hope of its being able to accom plish anything more. It was now nearly dark. General Sturgis was ordered forward to support the left. Notwithstanding the hard work in the early part of the day, his division moved forward with spirit. With its assistance the enemy were checked and held at bay. The command was ordered to fall back by General Cox, who commanded on the field the troops engaged in this affair beyond the Antietam. The artillery had been well served during the day. Night closed the long and desperately contested battle of the 17th. Nearly two hundred thousand men and five hun dred pieces of artillery were for fourteen hours engaged in this memorable battle."], [219, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 211 We had attacked the enemy in a position selected by the experienced engineer then in person directing their operations. We had driven them from their line on one flank, and secured a footing within it on the other. The army of the Potomac, notwithstanding the moral effect incident to previous reverses, had achieved a victory over an adversary invested with the prestige of recent suc cess. Our soldiers slept that night conquerors on a field won by their valor and covered with the dead and wounded of the enemy. The night, however, brought with it grave responsibilities. Whether to renew the attack on the 18th, or to defer it, even with the risk of the enemy's retire ment, was the question before me. After a night of anxious deliberation and a full and careful survey of the situation and condition of our army, the strength and position of the enemy, I concluded that the success of an attack on the 18th was not certain. I am aware of the fact that, under ordinary circumstances, a general is expected to risk a battle if he has a reasonable prospect of success ; but at this critical juncture I should have had a narrow view of the condition of the country had I been willing to hazard another battle with less than an absolute assurance of success. At that moment \u2014 Virginia lost, Washington menaced, Maryland in vaded \u2014 the national cause could afford no risks of defeat. One battle lost, and almost all would have been lost. Lee's army might then have marched as it pleased on Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, or New York. It could have levied its supplies from a fertile and undevastated country ; extorted tribute from wealthy and populous cities ; and nowhere east of the Alleghanies was there another organized force able to arrest its march. The following are among the considerations which led me to doubt the cer tainty of success in attacking before the 19th: The troops were greatly overcome by the fatigue and exhaustion attendant upon the long continued and severely contested battle of the 17th, together with the long day and night marches to which they had been subjected during the previous three days. The supply trains were in the rear, and many of the troops had suffered from hunger. They required rest and refreshment. One division of Sumner's and all of Hooker's corps, on the right, had, after fighting most valiantly for several hours, been overpowered by numbers, driven back in great disorder, and much scattered, so that they were for the time somewhat demoralized. In Hooker's corps, according to the return made by General Meade, com manding, there were but 6,729 men present on the 18th; whereas, on the morning of the 22d, there were 13,093 men present, for duty in the same corps, showing that previous to and during the battle 6,364 men were separated from their command. General Meade, in an official communication upon this subject, dated Sep tember 18, 1862, says: \" I enclose a field return of the corps made this afternoon, which I desire you will lay before the commanding general. I am satisfied the great reduction in the corps since the recent engagements is not due solely to the. casualties of battle, and that a considerable number of men are still in the rear, some having dropped out on the march, and many dispersing and leaving yesterday during the tight. I think the efficiency of the corps, so far as it goes, good. To resist an attack in our present strong position I think they may be depended on, and I hope they will perform duty in case we make an attack, though I do not think their morale is as good for an offensive as a defensive movement.\" One division of Sumner's corps had also been overpowered, and was a good deal scattered and demoralized. It was not deemed by its corps commander m proper condition to attack the enemy vigorously the next day."], [220, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 212 Some of the new troops on the left, although many of them fought well during the battle, and are entitled to great credit, were, at the close of the action, driven back, and their morale impaired. On the morning of the 18th General Burnside requested me to send him another division to assist in holding his position on the other side of the Antie tam, aud to enable him to withdraw his corps if he should be attacked by a superior force. He gave me the impression that if he were attacked again that morning he would not be able to make a very vigorous resistance. I visited his position early, determined to send General Morell's division to his aid, and directed that it should be placed on this side of the Antietam, in order that it might cover the retreat of his own corps from the other side of the Antietam, should that become necessary, at the same time it was in position to re-enforce our centre or right, if that were needed. \" Late in the afternoon I found that, although he had not been attacked, Gen eral Burnside had withdrawn his own corps to this side of the Autietam, and sent over Morell's division alone to hold the opposite side. A large number of our heaviest and most efficient batteries had consumed all their ammunition on the 16th and 17th, and it was impossible to supply them until late on the following day. Supplies of provisions and forage had to be brought up and issued, and in fantry ammunition distributed. Finally, re-enforcements to the number of 14,000 men \u2014 to say nothing of troops expected from Pennsylvania \u2014 had not arrived, but were expected during the day. The 18th was, therefore, spent in collecting the dispersed, giving rest to the fatigued, removing the wounded, burying the dead, and the necessary prepara tions for a renewal of the battle. Of the re-enforcements, Couch's division, marching with commendable rapidity, came up into position at a late hour in the morning. Humphrey's division of new troops, in their anxiety to participate in the battle which was raging, when they received the order to march from Frederick at about half past three p. m., on the 17th, pressed forward during the entire night, and the mass of the division reached the army fluring the following morning. Having marched more than twenty-three miles after half past four o'clock on the preceding afternoon, they were, of course, greatly exhausted, and needed rest and refreshment. Large re-enforcements expected from Pennsylvania never arrived. During the 18th orders were given for a renewal of the attack at daylight on the 1 9th. On the night of the 18th the enemy, after passing troops in the latter part of the day from the Virginia shore to their position behind Sharpsburg, as seen by our officers, suddenly formed the design of abandoning their position, and re treating across the river. As their line was hut a short distance from the river, the evacuation presented but little difficulty, and was effected before daylight About 2,700 of the enemy's dead were, under the direction of Major Davis, assistant inspector general, counted and buried upon the battle-field of Antietam. A portion of their dead had been previously buried by the enemy. This is con clusive evidence that the enemy sustained much greater loss than we. Thirteen guns, thirty-nine colors, upwards of fifteen thousand stand of small arms, and more than six thousand prisoners, were the trophies which attest the success of our army in the battles of South Mountain, Crampton's Gap, and Antietam. Not a single gun or color was lost by our army during these battles."], [221, "EEPOET OF GENERAL GEOEGE B.

General Porter, commanding the 5th corps, ordered a detachment from Griffin's and Barnes's brigades, under General Griffin, to cross the river at dark, and carry the enemy's batteries. This was gallantly done under the fire of the enemy ; several guns, caissons, &c, were taken, and their supports driven back half a mile. The information obtained during the progress of this affair indicated that the mass of the enemy had retreated on the Charlestown and Martinsburg roads, towards Winchester. To verify this, and to ascertain how far the enemy had retired, General Porter was authorized to detach from his corps, on the morning of the 20th, a reconnoitring party in greater force. This detachment crossed the river, and advanced about a mile, when it was attacked by a large body of the enemy lying in ambush in the woods, and driven back across the river with considerable loss. This reconnoissance showed that the enemy was still in force on the Virginia bank of the Potomac, prepared to resist our further advance. It was reported to me on the 19th that General Stuart had made his ap pearance at Williamsport with some four thousand cavalry and six pieces of artillery, and that ten thousand infantry were marching on the same point from the direction of Winchester. I ordered General Couch to march at once with his division, and a part of Pleasonton's cavalry, with Franklin's corps, within supporting distance, for the purpose of endeavoring to capture this force. General Couch made a prompt and rapid march to Williamsport, and attacked the enemy vigorously, but they made their escape across the river. I despatched the following telegraphic report to the general -in-chief : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Sharpshurg, September 19, 1862. \" I have the honor to report that Maryland is entirely freed from the presence of the enemy, who has been driven across the Potomac.

I think he has a force of infantry near Shepherdstown. \" I regret that you find it necessary to couch every despatch I have the honor to receive from you in a spirit of fault-finding, and that you have not yet found leisure to say one word in commendation of the recent achievements of this army, or even to allude to them. \" I have abstained from giving the number of guns, colors, small arms, pris oners, &c, captured, until I could do so with some accuracy. I hope by to morrow evening to be able to give at least an approximate statement. \"G. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding. \"Major General Halleck, \" General-in-Chief, Washington.\" On the same day I telegraphed as follows \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" September 20, 1862. \" As the rebel army, now on the Virginia side of the Potomac, must in a great measure be dependent for supplies of ammunition and provisions upon Richmond, I would respectfully suggest that General Banks be directed to send out a cav alry force to cut their supply communication opposite Washington. This would seriously embarrass their operations, and will aid this army materially. \" G. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding. \" Major General H. W. Halleck, \" Commanding United States Army.\" Maryland heights were occupied by General Williams's corps on this day, and on the 22d General Sumuer took possession of Harper's Ferry. It will be remembered that at the time I was assigned to the command of the forces for the defence of the national capital, on the 2d day of September, 1862, the greater part of all the available troops were suffering under the disheartening influences of the serious defeat they had encountered during the brief and unfor tunate campaign of General Pope. Their numbers were greatly reduced by casualties, their confidence was much shaken, and they had lost something of that \"esprit du corps\" which is indispensable to the efficiency of an army"], [224, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 216 Moreover, they had left behind, lost, or worn out, the greatest part of their cloth ing and camp equipage, which required renewal before they could be in proper condition to take the field again. The intelligence that the enemy was crossing the Potomac into Maryland was received in Washington on the 4th of September, and the army of the Potomac was again put in motion, under my direction, on the following day, so that but a very brief interval of time was allowed to reorganize or procure supplies. The sanguinary battles of South Mountain and Antietam fought by this army a few days afterwards, with the reconnoissances immediately following, resulted in a loss to us of ten general officers, many regimental and company officers, and a large number of enlisted men, amounting in the aggregate to fifteen thousand two hundred and twenty, (15,220.) Two army corps had been sadly cut up, scattered, and somewhat demoralized in the action on the 17th. In General Sumner's corps alone forty-one (41) commissioned officers and eight hundred and nineteen (819) enlisted men had been killed ; four (4) general officers, eighty-nine (S9) other commissioned officers, and three thousand seven hundred and eight (3,70S) enlisted men had been wounded, besides five hundred and forty-eight (548) missiug; making the aggregate loss in this splendid veteran corps, in this one battle, five thousand two hundred and nine, (5,209.) In General Hooker's corps the casualties of the same engagement amounted to two thousand- six hundred and nineteen, (2,619.) The entire army had been greatly exhausted by unavoidable overwork, fa tiguing marches, hunger, and want of sleep and rest, previous to the last battle. When the enemy recrossed the Potomac into Virginia the means of transpor tation at my disposal were inadequate to furnish a single day's supply of sub sistence in advance. Many of the troops were new levies, some of whom had fought like veterans, but the morale of others had been a good deal impaired in those severely con tested actions, and they required time to recover, as well as to acquire the neces sary drill and discipline. Under these circumstances I did not feel authorized to cross the river with the main army over a very deep and difficult ford in pursuit of the retreating enemy, known to be in strong force on the south bank, and thereby place that stream, which was liable at any time to rise above a fording stage, between my army and its base of supply. I telegraphed on the 22d to the general-in-chief as follows : \"As soon as the exigencies of the service will admit of it, this army should be reorganized. It is absolutely necessary, to secure its efficiency, that the old skeleton regiments should be filled up at once, and officers appointed to supply the numerous existing vacancies. There are instances where captains are com manding regiments, and companies are without a single commissioned officer.\" On the 23d the following was telegraphed to the general-in-chief: \" Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" Near Shepherd stown, September 23, 1862 \u2014 9.30 a. m. \" From several different sources I learn that General R. E. Lee is stdl opposite to my position at Leestown, between Shepherdstown and Martinsburg, ana that General Jackson is on the Opequan creek, about three miles above its mouth, both with large forces. There are also indications of heavy re-enforcements moving towards them from Winchester and Charlestown. I have therefore or dered General Franklin to take position with his corps at the cross-roads about one mile northeast of Bakersvdle, on the Bakersville and Williamsport road, and General Couch to establish his division near Downsville, leaving sufficient force at Williamsport to watch and guard the ford at that place. The fact of the enemy's remaining so long in our front, and the indications of an advance"], [225, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 217 of re-enforcements, seem to indicate that he will give us another battle with all his available force. \"As I mentioned to you before, our army has been very much reduced by casualties in the recent battles, and in my judgment all the re-enforcements of old troops that can possibly be dispensed with around Washington and other places should be instantly pushed forward by rail to this army. A defeat at this juncture would be ruinous to our cause. I cannot think it possible that the enemy will bring any forces to bear upon Washington till after the question is decided here ; but if he should, troops can soon be sent back from this army by rail to re-enforce the garrison there. \" The evidence I have that re-enforcements are coming to the rebel army consists in the fact that long columns of dust extending from Winchester to Charlestown and from Charlestown in this direction, and also troops moving this way, were seen last evening. This is corroborated by citizens. General Sum ner with his corps and Williams's (Banks's) occupies Harper's Ferry and the surrounding heights. I think he will be able to hold his position till re-enforce ments arrive. \"G. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General. \"Major General Halleck, \" General-in-Chief, Washington.\" On the 27th I made the following report : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" September 27, 1862\u201410 a. m. \" All the information in my possession goes to prove that the main body of the enemy is concentrated not far from Martinsburg, with some troops at Charles- town ; not many in Winchester. Their movements of late have been an exten- sion towards our right and beyond it. They are receiving re-enforcements in Winchester, mainly, I think, of conscripts \u2014 perhaps entirely so. \" This army is not now in condition to undertake another campaign, nor to bring on another battle, unless great advantages are offered by some mistake of the enemy, or pressing military exigencies render it necessary. We are greatly deficient in officers. Many of the old regiments are reduced to mere skeletons. The new regiments need instruction. Not a day should be lost in filling the old regiments \u2014 our main dependence \u2014 and in supplying vacancies among the offi- cers by promotion. \" My present purpose is to hold the army about as it is now, rendering Har- per's Ferry secure and watching the river closely, intending to attack the enemy should he attempt to cross to this side. \" Our possession of Harper's Ferry gives us the great advantage of a secure debouche, but we cannot avail ourselves of it until the railroad bridge is finished, because we cannot otherwise supply a greater number of troops than we now have on the Virginia side at that point. When the river rises so that the enemy cannot cross in force, I purpose concentrating the army somewhere near Harper's Ferry, and then acting according to circumstances, viz: moving on Winchester, if from the position and attitude of the enemy we are likely to gain a great ad- vantage by doing so, or else devoting a reasonable time to the organization of the army aud instruction of the new troops, preparatory to an advance on what- ever line may be determined. In any event, I regard it as absolutely necessary to send new regiments at once to the old corps, for purposes of instruction, and that the old regiments be filled at once. I have no fears as to an attack on Wash- ington by the line of Manassas. Holding Harper's Ferry as I do, they w-ill not run the risk of an attack on then- flank and rear while they have the garrison of Washington in their front."], [226, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 218 \" I rather apprehend a renewal of the attempt in Maryland should the river remain low for a great length of time, and should they receive considerable ad dition to their force. I would be glad to have Peck's division as soon as possi ble. I. am surprised that Sigel's men should have been sent to Western Virginia withou my knowledge. The last I heard from you on the subject was that they were at my disposition. In the last battles the enemy was undoubtedly greatly superior to us in number, and it was only by very hard fighting that we gained the advantage we did, As it was, the result was at one period very doubtful, and we bad all we could do to win the day. If the enemy receives considerable re-enforcements and we none, it is possible that I may have too much on my hands in the next battle. My own view of the proper policy to be pursued is to retain in Washington merely the force necessary to garrison it, and to send everything else available to re-enforce this army. The railways give ns the means of promptly re-enforcing Washington should it become necessary. If I am re-enforced, as I ask, and am allowed to take my own course, I will hold myself responsible for the safety of Washington. Several persons re cently from Richmond say that there are no troops there except conscripts, and they few in number. I hope to give you details as to late battles by this eve ning;. I am about starting again for Harper's Ferry. \" G. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General Commanding. \"Major General Halleck, \" General-in-Chief, Washington.\" The work of reorganizing, drilling, aud supplying the army, I began at the earliest moment. The different corps were stationed along the river in the best positions to cover and guard the fords. The great extent of the river front from near Washington to Cumberland, (some one hundred and fifty miles,) to gether with the line of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, was to be carefully watched and guarded, to prevent, if possible, the enemy's raids. Reconnoissances upon the Virginia side of the river, for the purpose of learning the enemy's positions and movements, were made frequently, so that our cavalry, which from the time we left Washington had performed the most laborious service, and had from the commencement been deficient in numbers, was found totally inadequate to the requirements of the army. This overwork had broken down the greater part of the horses ; disease had appeared among them, and but a very small portion of our original cavalry force was fit for service. To such an extent had this arm become reduced, that when General Stuart made his raid into Pennsylvania on the 11th of October with two thousand men, I could only mount eight hundred men to follow him. Harper's Ferry was occupied on the 22d, and in order to prevent a catas trophe similar to the one which had happened to Colonel Miles, I immediately ordered Maryland, Bolivar, and Loudon heights to be strongly fortified. This was done as far as the time and means at our disposal permitted. The main army of the enemy, during this time, remained in the vicinity of Martinsburg and Bunker hill, and occupied itself in drafting and coercing every able-bodied citizen into the ranks, forcibly taking their property, where it was not voluntarily offered, burning bridges, and destroying railroads. On the first day of October his excellency the President honored the army of the Potomac with a visit, and remained several days, during which he went through the different encampments, reviewed the troops, and went over the bat tle-fields of South Mountain and Antietam. I had the opportunity during this visit to describe to him the operations of the army since the time it left Wash ington, and gave him my reasons for not following the enemy after he crossed the Potomac."], [227, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 219 On the 5th of October the division of General Cox (about 5,000 men) was ordered from my command to Western Virginia. Oh the 7th of October I received the following telegram : \"Washington, D. C, October 6, 1862. \" I am instructed to telegraph you as follows : The President directs that you cross the Potomac and give battle to the enemy, or drive him south. Your army must move now, while the roads are good. If you cross the river between the enemy and Washington, and cover the latter by your operation, you can be re-enforced with 30,000 men. If you move up the valley of the Shenandoah, not more than 12,000 or 15,000 can be sent to you. The President advises the interior line between Washington and the enemy, but does not order it. He is very desirous that your army move as soon as possible. You will immediately report what line you adopt, and when you intend to cross the river; also to what point the re-enforcements are to be sent. It is necessary that the plan of your operations be positively determined on, before orders are given for building bridges and repairing railroads. I am directed to add, that the Secretary of War and the general-in-chief fully concur with the President in these instruc tions. \"H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief \" Major General McClellan.\" At this time General Averill, with the' greater part of our efficient cavalry, was in the vicinity of Cumberland, and General Kelly, the commanding officer, had that day reported that a large force of the enemy was advancing on Colonel Campbell, at Saint John's river. This obliged me to order General Averill to proceed with his force to the support of Colonel Campbell, which de layed his return to the army for several days. On the 10th of October Stuart crossed the river at McCoy's Ferry, with 2,000 cavalry and a battery of horse artillery, on his raid into Maryland and Pennsylvania, making it necessary to use all our cavalry against him. This exhausting service completely broke down nearly all of our cavalry horses, and rendered a remount absolutely indispensable before we could advance on the enemy. The following were the dispositions of troops made by me to defeat the pur poses of this raid : General Averill, then at Green Spring, on the upper Potomac, was ordered to move rapidly down upon the north side of the river, with all his disposable cavalry, using every exertion to get upon the trail of the enemy, and follow it up vigorously. General Pleasonton, with the remaining cavalry force, was ordered to take the road by Cavetown, Harmon's gap, and Mechanicsville, and cut off the re treat of the enemy should he make for any of the fords below the position of the main army. His orders were to pursue them with the utmost rapidity, not to spare his men or horses, and to destroy or capture them if possible. General Crook, at that time commanding Cox's division, at Hancock, en route for Western Virginia, was ordered to halt, place his men in cars, and remain in readiness to move to any point above should the enemy return in that direction, keeping his scouts well out on all the roads leading from the direction of Cham bersburg to the upper Potomac. The other commanders between Hancock and Harper's Ferry were instructed to keep a vigilant watch upon all the roads and fords, so as to prevent the escape of the rebels within these limits. General Burnside was ordered to send two brigades to the Monocacy crossing, there to remain in cars, with steam up, ready to move to any point on the rail road to which Stuart might be aiming, whde Colonel Rush, at Frederick, was"], [228, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 220 directed to keep his lancers scouting on the approaches from Chambersburg, so as to give timely notice to the commander of the two brigades at the Monocacy crossing. General Stoneman, whose headquarters were then at Poolsville, occupying with his division the different fords on the river below the mouth of the Monoc acy, was directed to keep his cavalry well out on the approaches from the direction of Frederick, so as to give him time to mass his troops at any point where the enemy might attempt to cross the Potomac in his vicinity. He was informed of General Pleasonton's movements. After the orders were given for covering all the fords upon the river, I did not think it possible for Stuart to recross, and I believed that the capture or destruction of his entire force was perfectly certain; but owing to the fact that my orders were not in all cases carried out as I expected, he effected his escape into Virginia without much loss. The troops sent by General Burnside to the Monocacy, owing to some neglect in not giving the necessary orders to the commander, instead of remaining at the railroad crossing, as I directed, marched four miles into Frederick, and there remained until after Stuart had passed the railroad, only six miles below, near which point it was said he halted for breakfast. General Pleasonton ascertained, after his arrival at Mechanicsville, that the enemy were only about an hour ahead of him, beating a hasty retreat towards the mouth of the Monocacy. He pushed on vigorously, and, near its mouth, overtook them with a part of his force, having marched seventy-eight miles in twenty-four hours, and having left many of his horses broken down upon the road. He at once attacked with his artillery, and the firing continued for several hours, during which time he states that he received the support of a small por tion of General Stoneman's command, not sufficient to inflict any material damage upon the enemy. General Stoneman reports that, in accordance with his instructions, he gave all necessary orders for intercepting the return of the rebels, and Colonel Staples, commanding one of his brigades, states that he sent two regiments of infantry to the mouth of the Monocacy, and one regiment to White's ford ; that on the morning of the 12th, about ten o'clock, he, by General Stoneman's order, marched the remaining three regiments of his command from Poolsville towards the mouth of the Monocacy ; that before getting into action he was relieved by General Ward, who states that he reported to General Pleasonton with his command, while the enemy was crossing the river, and was informed by him (General Pleasonton) that he was too late, and that nothing could be done then. General Pleasonton, in his report of this affair, says : \" It was at this time that Colonel Ward reported to me from General Stoneman's division, with a brigade of infantry, a regiment of cavalry, and a section of artillery. I told him that his command could be of no use, as the enemy had then crossed the river. These are the only troops, that I knew of, that were in that vicinity, and this was the first intimation I received that any troops were endeavoring to assist me in capturing the rebels. I succeeded in preventing the enemy from crossing at the mouth of the Monocacy, and drove him to White's ford, three miles below. Had White's ford been occupied by any force of ours previous to the time of the occupation by the enemy, the capture of Stuart's whole force would have been certain and inevitable. With my small force, which did not exceed one-fourth of the enemy's, it was not practicable for me to occupy that ford while the enemy was in front.\" It would seem from the report of General Stoneman that the disposition he made of his troops, previous to the arrival of Stuart, was a good one. He sta tioned two regiments at the mouth of Monocacy, and two regiments at White's ford, the latter in the very place where the crossing was made, and the former only three miles off, with a reserve of three regiments at Poolsville, some six"], [229, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 221 miles distant. General Pleasonton's report shows that from the time the firing commenced until the enemy were across the river was about four and a half hours. General Stoneman states that he started the reserve from Poolsville at about nine o'clock, but it appears, from the report of General Pleasonton, that it did not reach him until half past one. At the time I received the order of October 6, to cross the river and attack the enemy, the army was wholly deficient in cavalry, and a large part of our troops were in want of shoes, blankets, and other indispensable articles of clothing, notwithstanding all the efforts that had been made since the battle of Antietam, and even prior to that date, to refit the army with clothing, as well as horses. I at once consulted with Colonel Iugalls, the chief quartermaster, who believed that the necessary articles could be supplied in about three days. Orders were immediately issued to the different commanders who had not already sent in their requisitions, to do so at once, and all the necessary steps were forthwith taken by me to insure a prompt delivery of the supplies. The requisitions were forwarded to the proper department at Washington, and I ex pected that the articles would reach our depots during the three days specified ; but day after day elapsed, aud only a small portion of the clothing arrived. Corps commanders, upon receiving notice from the quartermasters that they might expect to receive their supplies at certain dates, sent the trains for them, which, after waiting, were compelled to return empty. Several instances oc curred where these trains went back and forth from the camps to the depots, as often as four or five different times, without receiving their supplies, and I was informed by one corps commander that his wagon train had travelled over 150 miles, to and' from the depots, before he succeeded in obtaining his clothing. The corps of General Franklin did not get its clothing until after it had crossed the Potomac, and was moving into Virginia. General Reynolds's corps was delayed a day at Berlin, to complete its supplies, and General Porter only completed his on reaching the vicinity of Harper's Ferry. I made every exertion in my power, and my quartermasters did the same, to have these supplies hurried forward rapidly ; and I was repeatedly told that they had filled the requisitions at Washington, and that the supplies had been forwarded. But they did not come to us, and of course were inaccessible to the army. I did not fail to make frequent representation of this condition of things to the general-in-chief, and it appears that he referred the matter to the Quartermaster General, who constantly replied that the supplies had been promptly ordered. Notwithstanding this, they did not reach our depots. The following extracts are from telegrams upon this subject : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" October 11, 1862\u20149 a. m. \" We have been making every effort to get supplies of clothing for this army, and Colonel Ingalls has received advices that it has been forwarded by railroad ; but, owing to bad management on the roads, or from some other cause, it comes in very slowly, and it will take a much longer time than was anticipated to get articles that are absolutely indispensable to the army, unless the railroad man agers forward supplies more rapidly. 5 ** \" GEORGE B.

The clothing of Sumner arrived in great quantities near the last of October, almost too late for issue, as the army was crossing into Virginia.

The difficulty in getting new supplies from the usual sources led me to apply for and obtain authority for the cavalry and artillery officers to purchase their own horses. The following are the telegrams and letters on this subject : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" October 12, 1862\u201412:45 p. m. \" It is absolutely necessary that some energetic means be taken to supply the cavalry of this army with remount horses.

Large requisitions were prepared and sent in. The artillery and cavalry required large numbers to cover losses sustained m battle, on the march, and by diseases. Both of these arms were deficient when they left Washington. A most violent and destructive disease made its appear ance at this time, which put nearly 4,000 animals out of service. Horses re ported perfectly well one day would be dead lame the next, and it was difficult to foresee where it would end, or what number would cover the loss. They were attacked in the hoof and tongue. No one seemed able to account for the appearance of this disease. Animals kept at rest would recover in time, but could not be worked. I made application to send west and purchase horses at once, but it was refused, on the ground that the outstanding contracts provided for enough, but they were not delivered sufficiently fast, nor in sufficient numbers, until late in October and early in November I was authorized to buy 2,500 late in October, but the delivery was not completed untd in November, after we had reached Warrenton.\" In a letter from General Meigs, written on the 14th of October, and addressed to the general-in-chief, it is stated : \" There have been issued, therefore, to the army of the Potomac, since the battles in front ot' Washington, to replace losses, (9,254) nine thousand two hundred and fifty-four horses.\" What number of horses were sent to General Pope before his return to Wash ington I have no means of determining ; but the following statement made upon my order, by the chief quartermaster with the army, and who had means for gaining accurate information, force upon my mind the conclusion that the Quartermaster General was in error : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \"Chief Quartermaster's Office, October 31, 1862.

McClellan 1,200 \"Issued and turned over to the above force by Captain J. J. Dana, assistant quartermaster, (in Washington) 2,261 \"Issued to forces at and near Washington which have since joined the command 352 \"Total purchased by Colonel Ingalls and issued and turned over by Captain Dana to the forces in this immediate command 3,813"], [235, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B.

Ingalls, chief quartermaster, and issued and turned over by Captain J. J. Dana, assistant quartermaster, to the entire army of the Potomac and the forces around Washington 7,176 About 3,000 horses have been turned over to the quartermaster's department by officers as unfit for service ; nearly 1,500 should now be turned over also, being worn out and diseased. Respectfully submitted. \"FRED. MYERS, \" Lieutenant Colonel and Quartermaster.\" This official statement, made up from the reports of the quartermasters who received and distributed the horses, exhibits the true state of the case, and gives the total number of horses received by the army of the Potomac, and the troops around Washington, during a period of eight weeks as (7,176) seven thousand one hundred and seventy-six, or (2,078) two thousand and seventy-eight less than the number stated by the Quartermaster General. * Supposing that (1,500) fifteen hundred were issued to the army under General Pope previous to its return to Washington, as General Meigs states, there would still remain (578) five hundred and seventy- eight horses which he does not account for. The letter of the general-in-chief to the Secretary of War on the 28th of October, and the letter of General Meigs to the general-in-chief on the 14th of October, convey the impression that, upon my repeated applications for cavalry and artillery horses for the army of the Potomac, I had received a much greater number than was really the case. It will be seen from Colonel Myers's report that, of all the horses alluded to by General Meigs, only (3,813) three thousand eight hundred and thirteen came to the army with which I was ordered to follow and attack the enemy. Of course the remainder did not in the slightest degree contribute to the efficiency of the cavalry or artillery of the army with which I was to cross the river. Neither did they in the least facilitate any preparations for carrying out the order to advance upon the enemy, as the general-in-chief 's letter might seem to imply. During the same period that we were receiving the horses alluded to about (3,000) three thousand of our old stock were turned into the quartermaster's department, and 1,500 more reported as iu such condition that they ought to be turned in as unfit for service ; thus leaving the active army some 700 short of the number required to make good existing deficiencies, to say nothing of providing remounts for men whose horses had died or been killed during the campaign and those previously dismounted. Notwithstanding all the efforts made to obtain a remount, there were, after deducting the force engaged in picketing the river, but about a thousand serviceable cavalry horses on the 21st day of October. In a letter dated October 14, 1S62, the general-in-chief says : \" It is also reported to me that the number of animals with your army in the field is about 31,000. It is believed that your present proportion of cavalry and of animals is much larger than that of any other of our armies.\" What number of animals our other armies had I am not prepared to say, but military men in European armies have been of the opinion that an army to be efficient, while carrying on active operations in the field, should have a cavalry force equal in numbers to from one-sixth to one-fourth of the infantry force. My"], [236, "228 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. cavalry did not amount to one-twentieth part of the army, and hence the neces sity of giving every one of my cavalry soldiers a serviceable horse. Cavalry may be said to constitute the antenna of an army. It scouts all the roads in front, on the flanks and in the rear of the advancing columns, and con stantly feels the enemy The amount of labor falling on this arm during the Maryland campaign was excessive. To persons not familiar with the movements of troops, and the amount of transportation required for a large army marching away from water or railroad communications, the number of animals mentioned by the general-in-chief may have appeared unnecessarily large; but to a military man, who takes the trouble to enter into an accurate and detailed computation of the number of pounds of subsistence and forage required for such an army as that of the Potomac, it will be seen that the 31,000 animals were considerably less than was absolutely neces sary to an advance. As we were required to move through a country which could not be depended upon for any of our supplies, it became necessary to transport everything in wagons, and to be prepared for all emergencies. I did not consider it safe to leave the river without subsistence and forage for ten days. The official returns of that date show the aggregate strength of the army for duty to have been about 110,000 men of all arms. This did not include team sters, citizen employes, officers' servants, &c, amounting to some 12,000, which gave a total of 122,000 men. The subsistence alone of this army for ten days required for its transporta tion 1,830 wagons at 2,000 pounds to the wagon, and 10,980 animals. Our cavalry horses at that time amounted to 5,046, and our artillery horses to 6,836. To transport full forage for these 22,862 animals for ten days required 17,832 additional animals ; and this forage would only supply the entire num ber (40,694) of animals with a small fraction over half allowance for the time specified. It will be observed that this estimate does not embrace the animals necessary to transport quartermasters' supplies, baggage, camp equipage, ambulances, re serve ammunition, forage for officers' horses, &c, which would greatly aug ment the necessary transportation. It may very truly be said that we did make the march with the means at our disposal, but it will be remembered that we met with no serious opposition from the enemy ; neither did we encounter delays from any other cause. The roads were in excellent condition, and the troops marched with the most commenda ble order and celerity. If we had met with a determined resistance from the enemy, and our pro gress had been very much retarded thereby, we would have consumed our sup plies before they could have been renewed. A proper estimate of my responsi bilities as the commander of that army did not justify me in basing my preparations for the expedition upon the supposition that I was to have an un interrupted march. On the contrary, it was my duty to be prepared for all emergencies ; and not the least important of my responsibilities was the duty of making ample provision for supplying my men and animals with rations aud forage. Knowing the solicitude of the President for an early movement, and sharing with him fully his anxiety for prompt action, on the 21st of October I tele graphed to the general-in-chief as follows : \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" October 21, 1862. \" Since the receipt of the President's order to move on the enemy, I have been making every exertion to get this army supplied with clothing absolutely neces sary for marching."], [237, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 229 This, I am happy to say, is now nearly accomplished. I have also, during tne same time, repeatedly urged upon you the importance of supplying cavalry and artillery horses to replace those broken down by hard service, and steps nave been taken to insure a prompt delivery. \" Our cavalry, even when well supplied with horses, is much inferior in num bers to that of the enemy, but in efficiency has proved itself superior. So forcibly has this been impressed upon our old regiments by repeated successes, that the men are fully persuaded that they are equal to twice their number of rebel cavalry. \" Exclusive of the cavalry force now engaged in picketing the river, I have not at present over about one thousand (1,000) horses for service. Officers have been sent in various directions to purchase horses, and I expect them soon. Without more cavalry horses our communications, from the moment we march, would be at the mercy of the large cavalry force of the enemy, and it would not be possible for us to cover our flanks properly, or to obtain the necessary informa tion of the position and movements of the enemy, in such a way as to insure success. My experience has shown the necessity of a large and efficient cavalry force. \" Under the foregoing circumstances, I beg leave to ask whether the President desires me to march on the enemy at ouce, or to await the reception of the new horses, every possible step having been taken to insure their prompt arrival. \"GEO. B. McCLELLAN, \" Major General, Commanding. \" Major General H. W. Halleck, \" General-in-Chief, Washington.\" On the same day General Halleck replied as follows : \"Washington, October 21, 1862 \u2014 3p.m. \" Your telegram of 12 m. has been submitted to the President. He directs me to say that he has no change to make in his order of the 6th instant. \" If you have not been, and are not now, in condition to obey it, you will be able to show such want of ability. The President does not expect impossibilities ; but he is very anxious that all this good weather should not be wasted in inac tivity. Telegraph when you will move, and ou what lines you propose to march. \"H. W. HALLECK, \" General-in- Chief. \" Major General Geo. B. McClellan.\" From the tenor of this despatch I conceived that it was left for my judgment to decide whether or not it was possible to move with safety to the army at that time; and this responsibility I exercised with the more confidence in view of the strong assurances of his trust in me, as commander of that army, with which the President had seen fit to honor me during his last visit. The cavalry requirements, without which an advance would have been in the highest degree injudicious and unsafe, were still wanting. The country before us was an enemy's country, where the inhabitants fur nished to the enemy every possible assistance; providing food for men and forage for animals, giving all information concerning our movements, and ren dering every aid iu their power to the enemy's cause. It was manifest that we should find it, as we subsequently did, a hostile dis trict, where we could derive no aid from the inhabitants that would justify dis pensing with the active co-operation of an efficient cavalry force. Accordingly I fixed upon the first of November as the earliest date at which the forward movement could well be commenced."], [238, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 230 The general-in-chief, in a letter to the Secretary of War, on the 28th of October, says : \" In my opinion, there has been no such want of supplies in the army under General McClellan as to prevent his compliance with the orders to advance against the enemy.\" Notwithstanding this opinion, expressed by such high authority, I am com pelled to say again that the delay in the reception of necessary supplies up to that date had left the army in a condition totally unfit to advance against the enemy \u2014 that an advance, under the existing circumstances, would, in my judg ment, have been attended with the highest degree, of peril, with great suffering and sickness among the men, and with imminent danger of being cut off from our supplies by the superior cavalry force of the enemy, and with no reasonable prospect of gaining any advantage over him. I dismiss this subject with the remark, that I have found it impossible to resist the force of my own convictions that the commander of an army who, from the time of its organization, has for eighteen months been in constant communication with its officers and men, the greater part of the time engaged in active service in the field, and who has exercised this command in many battles, must cer tainly be considered competent to determine whether his army is in proper con dition to advance on the enemy or not ; and he must necessarily possess greater facilities for forming a correct judgment in regard to the wants of his men, and the condition of his supplies, than the general-in-chief in his office at Wash ington city. The movement from Washington into Maryland, which culminated in the battles of South Mountain and Antietam, was not a part of an offensive campaign, with the object of the invasion of the enemy's territory and an attack upon his capital, but was defensive in its purposes, although offensive in its character, and would be technically called a \"defensive-offensive campaign.\" It was undertaken at a time when our army had experienced severe defeats, and its object was to preserve the national capital and Baltimore, to protect Pennsylvania from invasion, and to drive the enemy out of Maryland. These purposes were fully and finally accomplished by the battle of Antietam, which brought the army of the Potomac into what might be termed an accidental posi tion on the upper Potomac. Having gained the immediate object of the campaign, the first thing to be done was to insure Maryland from a return of the enemy ; the second, to prepare our own army, exhausted by a series of severe battles, destitute to a great extent of supplies, and very deficient in artillery and cavalry horses, for a definite offem aive movement, and to determine upon the line of operations for a further advance. At the time of the battle of Antietam the Potomac was very low, and pre sented a comparatively weak line of defence unless watched by large masses of troops. The reoccupation of Harper's Ferry, and the disposition of troops above that point, rendered the line of the Potomac secure against everything except cavalry raids. No time was lost in placing the army in proper condition for an advance, and the circumstances which caused the delay after the battle of An tietam have been fully enumerated elsewhere. I never regarded Harper's Ferry or its vicinity as a proper base of opera tions for a movement upon Richmond. I still considered the line of the Penin sula as the true approach, but, for obvious reasons, did not make any proposal to return to it. On the 6th of October, as stated above, I was ordered by the President, through his general-in-chief, to cross the Potomac and give battle to the enemy, or drive him south. Two lines were presented for my choice : 1st. Up the valley of the Shenandoah, in which case I was to have 12,000 to 15,000 additional troops."], [239, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. MCLELLAN. 231 2d. To cross between the enemy and Washington\u2014 that is, east of the Bluo Ridge \u2014 in which event I was to be re-enforced with 30,000 men. At first I determined to adopt the line of the Shenandoah, for these reasons : lhe Harper's Ferry and Winchester railroad and the various turnpikes con verging upon Winchester afforded superior facilities for supplies. Our cavalry being weak, this line of communication could be more easily protected. There was no advantage in interposing at that time the Blue Ridge and the Shenan doah between the enemy and myself. At the period in question the Potomac was still very low, and I apprehended that, if I crossed the river below Harper's Ferry, the enemy would promptly check the movement by re-crossing into Maryland, at the same time covering his rear by occupying in strong force the passes leading through the Blue Ridge from the southeast into the Shenandoah valley. I anticipated, as the result of the first course, that Lee would fight me near Winchester, if he could do so under favorable circumstances ; or else that he would abandon the lower Shenandoah, and leave the army of the Potomac free to act upon some other line of operations. If he abandoned the Shenanhoah, he would naturally fall back upon his railway communications. I have since been confirmed in the belief that, if I had crossed the Potomac below Harper's Ferry in the early part of October, General Lee would have re-crossed into Maryland. As above explained, the army was not in condition to move until late in October, and* in the mean time circumstances had changed. The period had arrived when a sudden and great rise of the Potomac might be looked for at any moment ; the season of bad roads and difficult movements was approaching, which would naturally deter the enemy from exposing him self very far from his base, and his movements all appeared to indicate a fall ing back from the river towards his supplies. Under these circumstances, I felt at liberty to disregard the possibility of the enemy's re-crossing the Potomac, and determined to select the line east of the Blue Ridge, feeling convinced that it would secure me the largest accession of force, and the most cordial support of the President, whose views, from the beginning, were in favor of that line. The subject of the defence of the line of the upper Potomac, after the ad vance of the main army, had long occupied my attention. I desired to place Harper's Ferry and its dependencies in a strong state of defence, and frequently addressed the general-in-chief upon the subject of the erection of field-works and permanent bridges there, asking for the funds necessary to accomplish the purpose. Although I did my best to explain, as clearly as I was able, that I did not wish to erect permanent works of masonry, and that neither the, works nor the permanent bridges had any reference to the advance of the army, but solely to the permanent occupation of Harper's Ferry, I could never make the general-in-chief understand my wishes, but was refused the funds neces sary to erect the field-works, on the ground that there was no appropriation for the erection of permanent fortifications ; aud was not allowed to build the per manent bridge, on the ground that the main army could not be delayed in its movements until its completion. Of course I never thought of delaying the advance of the army for that pur pose, and so stated repeatedly. On the 25th of October I sent to the general in-chief the following telegram : \u2022' Headquarters Army of the Potomac, \" October 25, 1862 \u2014 10.45 p. m. \" As the moment is at hand for the advance of this army, a question arises for the decision of the general-in-chief, which, although perhaps impliedly decided by the President in bis letter of the 13th, should be clearly presented by me, as I do not regard it as iu my province to determine it."], [240, "232 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN \" This question is the extent to which the line of the Potomac should be guarded, after the army leaves, in order to cover Maryland and Pennsylvania from invasion by large or small parties of the enemy. \" It will always be somewhat d fficult to guard the immediate line of the river, owing to its great extent and the numerous passages which exist. \" It has long appeared to me that the best way of covering this line would be by occupying Front Royal, Strasburg, Wardensville and Moorefield, or the debouches of the several valleys in which they are situated. \" These points, or suitable places in their vicinity, should be strongly in trenched and permanently held. One great advantage of this arrangement would be the covering the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and an essential part of the system would be the construction of the link of railway from Winchester to Strasburg, and the rebuilding of the Manassas Gap railway bridge over the Shenandoah. \"The intrenchment of Manassas Junction would complete the system for the defence of the approaches to Washington and the upper Potomac. Many months ago I recommended this arrangement ; in fact, gave orders for it to be carried into effect. I still regard it as essential under all circumstances. \" The views of the chief engineer of this army, in regard to the defences and garrison of Harper's Ferry and its defences, are in your possession. \" The only troops under my command, outside of the organization of the army of the Potomac, are the Maryland brigade, under General Kenley ; the 54th Pennsylvania, Colonel Voss ; 12th Illinois cavalry, and Colonel Davis's 8th New York cavalry ; total, 2,894 infantry, one battery, and about 900 cav alry men. \" There are also two of my regiments of cavalry (about 750 men,) guarding the Baltimore and Ohio railroad between Hancock and Cumberland. \" As I have no department, and command simply an active army in the field, my responsibility for the safety of the line of the Potomac and the States north of it must terminate the moment I advance so far beyond that line as to adopt another for my base of operations. The question for the general-in chief to decide, and which I regard as beyond my province, is this : \" 1st. Shall the safety of Harper's Ferry and the line of the Potomac be re garded as assured by the advance of the army south of the Blue Ridge, and the line left to take care of itself? '' 2d. If it is deemed necessary to hold the line, or that hereinbefore indi cated in advance of it, how many troops shall be placed there, at what points, (and in what numbers and of what composition at each,) and where shall they be supplied \u2014 i. e., from the army, or from other sources'? \" Omitting the detached troops mentioned above, and the small garrisons of Boonsboro' and Frederick, the last returns show the strength of this army for duty to be about (116,000) one hundred and sixteen thousand officers and men. This includes the divisions of Stoneman and Whipple, but does not include Heintzelman, Sigel, and Bayard. \" If Harper's Ferry and the river above are rendered fully secure, it is pos sible that the active army, if it supplies the garrison, may be reduced so much as to be inadequate to the purposes contemplated. If it is preserved intact, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the Baltimore and Ohio railroad may be unduly exposed. \" I leave the decision of these grave questions to the general-in-chief. I know nothing of the number of troops at Baltimore, &c. \"An important element in the solution of this problem is the fact that a great portion of Bragg's army is probably now at liberty to unite itself with Lee's command."], [241, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B.

On the 25th of October the pontoon bridge at Berlin was constructed, there beino- already one across the Potomac, and another across the Shenandoah, at Harper's Ferry. . On the 26th two divisions of the ninth corps, and Pleasonton s brigade of cavalry, crossed at Berlin and occupied Lovettsville. The first, sixth, and ninth corps, the cavalry, and the reserve artillery, crossed at Berlin between the 26th of October and the 2d of November. The second and fifth corps crossed at Harper's Ferry between the 29th of October and the 1st of November. Heavy rains delayed the movement con siderably in the beginning, and the first, fifth and sixth corps were obliged to halt at least oue day at the crossings to complete, as far as possible, necessary supplies that could not be procured at an earlier period. The plan of campaign I adopted during this advance was to move the army, well in hand, parallel to the Blue Ridge, taking Warrenton as the point of direc-"], [244, "236 REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. tion for the main army ; seizing each pass on the Blue Ridge by detachments, as we approached it, and guarding them after we had passed as long as they would enable the enemy to trouble our communications with the Potomac. It was expected that we would unite with the eleventh corps and Sickles's division near Thoroughfare gap. We depended upon Harper's Ferry and Berlin for supplies until the Manassas Gap railway was reached ; when that occurred the passes in our rear were to be abandoned, and the army massed ready for action or move ment in any direction. It was my intention if, upon reaching Ashby's or any other pass, I found that the enemy were in force between it and the Potomac in the valley of the Shenandoah, to move into the valley and endeavor to gain their rear. I hardly hoped to accomplish this, but did expect that by striking in between Culpeper Court House and Little Washington I could either separate their army and beat them in detail, or else force them to concentrate as far back as Gordonsville, and thus place the army of the Potomac in position either to adopt the Fredericksburg line of advance upon Richmond, or to be removed to the Peninsula, if, as I apprehended, it were found impossible to supply it by the Orange and Alexandria railroad beyond Culpeper. On the 27th of October the remaining divisions of the ninth corps crossed at Berlin, and Pleasonton's cavalry advanced to Purcellville. The concentra tion of the sixth corps, delayed somewhat by intelligence as to the movements of the enemy near Hedgesville, &c, was commenced on this day, and the first corps was already in motion for Berlin. On the 28th the first corps and the general headquarters reached Berlin. On the 29th the reserve artillery crossed and encamped near Lovettsville. Stoneman's division, temporarily attached to the ninth corps, occupied Leesburg; Averill's cavalry brigade moved towards Berlin from Hagerstown ; two divisions of the ninth corps moved to Wheatland, and one to Waterford. The second corps commenced the passage of the Shenandoah at Harper's Ferry, and moved into the valley east of Loudon heights. On the 30th the first corps crossed at Berlin and encamped near Lovettsville, and the second corps completed the passage of the Shenandoah. The fifth corps commenced its march from Sharpsburg to Harper's Ferry. On the 31st the second corps moved to the vicinity of Hillsborough ; the sixth corps reached Boonsboro'; the fifth corps reached Harper's Ferry, one division crossing the Shenandoah. On the 1st of November the first corps moved to Purcellville and Hamilton ; the second corps to Woodgrove; the fifth corps to Hillsborough; the sixth corps reached Berlin, one division crossing. Pleasonton's cavalry occupied Philomont, having a sharp skirmish there and at Bloomfield. On November 2 the second corps occupied Snicker's gap ; the fifth corps, Snickersville ; the sixth corps crossed the Potomac and encamped near Wheat land ; the ninth corps advanced to Bloomfield, Union, and Philomont. Pleasonton drove the enemy out of Union. Averill was ordered to join Pleasonton. The enemy offered no serious resistance to the occupation of Snicker's gap, but ad vanced to gain possession of it with a column of some 5,000 to 6,000 infantry, who were driven back by a few rounds from our rifled guns. On the 3d the first corps moved to Philomont, Union, Bloomfield, &c. ; the second corps to the vicinity of Upperville ; the fifth corps remained at Snicker's gap ; the sixth corps moved to Purcellville ; the ninth corps moved towards Upperville. Pleasonton drove the enemy out of Upperville after a severe fight. On the 4th the 2d corps took possession of Ashby's gap ; the 6th corps reached Union; the 9th corps, Upperville; the cavalry occupied Piedmont. On the 5th the 1st corps moved to Rectortown and White Plains ; one division of the 2d corps to the intersection of the Paris and Piedmont with the Upper ville and Barber's road; the 6th corps to the Aldie pike, east of Upperville;"], [245, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 237 the 9th corps beyond the Manassas railroad, between Piedmont and Salem, with a brigade at Manassas gap. The cavalry under Averill had a skirmish at Manassas gap, and the brigade of Pleasonton gained a handsome victory over superior numbers at Barber's Cross Roads. Bayard's cavalry had some sharp skirmishing in front of Salem. On the 6th the 1st corps advanced to Warrenton ; the 2d corps to Rector town ; the 5th corps commenced its movement from Snicker's gap to Whito Plains ; the 9th corps to Waterloo and vicinity on the Rappahannock ; the 11th corps was at New Baltimore, Thoroughfare and HopewelFs gaps; Sickles's division guarding the Orange and Alexandria railroad from Manassas Junc tion towards Warrenton Junction ; the cavalry near Flint hill ; Bayard to cut off what there might be in Warrenton, and to proceed to the Rappahannock station. , November 7th : General Pleasonton was ordered to move towards Little Washington and Sperryville, and thence towards Culpeper 'Court House. November 8th : the 2d corps moved half way to Warrenton ; the 5th corps to New Baltimore. November 9 : the 2d and 5th corps reached Warrenton ; the 6th corps, New Baltimore. Late on the night of the 7th I received an order relieving me from the com mand of the army of the Potomac, and directing me to turn it over to General Burnside, which I at once did. I had already given the orders for the movements of the 8th and 9th ; these orders were carried into effect without change. The position in which I left the army, as the result of the orders I had given, was as follows : The 1st, 2d, and 5th corps, reserve artillery, and general headquarters, at Warrenton ; the 9th corps on the line of the Rappahannock, in the vicinity of Waterloo ; the 6th corps at New Baltimore ; the 11th corps at New Baltimore, Gainesville, and Thoroughfare gap ; Sickles's division of the 3d corps, on the Orange and Alexandria railroad, from Manassas Junction to Warrenton Junc tion ; Pleasonton across the Rappahannock at Amissville, Jefferson, &c, with his pickets at Hazel river, facing Longstreet, six mOes from Culpeper Court House ; Bayard near Rappahannock station. The army was thus massed near Warrenton, ready to act in any required direction, perfectly in hand, and in admirable condition aud spirits. I doubt whether, during the whole period that I had the honor to command the army of the Potomac, it was in such excellent condition to fight a great battle. When I gave up the command to General Burnside, the best information in our pos session indicated that Longstreet was immediately in our front near Culpeper ; Jackson, with one, perhaps both, of the Hills, near Chester and Thornton's gaps, with the mass of their force west of the Blue Ridge. The reports from General Pleasonton on the advance indicated the possibility of separating the two wings of the enemy's forces, and either beating Long street separately, or forcing him to fall back at least upon Gordonsville, to effect his junction with the rest of the army. The following is from the report of General Pleasonton : \" At this time, and from the 7th instant, my advance pickets were at Hazel river, within six miles of Culpeper, besides having my flank pickets towards Chester and Thornton's gaps extended to Gaines's Cross Roads and Newby's Cross Roads, with numerous patrols in the direction of Woodvdle, Little Wash ington, and Sperryville. \"The information gained from these parties, and also from deserters, prisoners, contrabands, as well as citizens, established the fact of Longstreet, with his command, being at Culpeper, while Jackson, with D. H. Hill, with their re spective commands, were in the Shenandoah valley, on the western side of the"], [246, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 238 Blue Ridge, covering Chester aud Thornton's gaps, and expecting us to pass through and attack them. \" As late as the 17th of November, a contraband just from Strasburg came in my camp and reported that D. H. Hill's corps was two miles beyond that place, on the railroad to Mount Jackson. Hill was tearing up the road and destroying the bridges, under the impression that we intended to fol low into that valley, and was en route for Staunton. \" Jackson's corps was between Strasburg and Winchester. Ewell and A. P. Hill were with Jackson. Provisions were scarce, and the rebels were obliged to keep moving to obtain them.\" Had I remained in command, I should have made the attempt to divide the enemy as before suggested, and could he have been brought to a battle within reach of my supplies, I cannot doubt that the result would have been a brilliant victory for our army. On the 10th of November General Pleasonton was attacked by Longstreet, with one division of infantry and Stuart's cavalry, but repulsed the attack. This indicates the relative position of our army and that of the enemy at the time I was relieved from command. It would be impossible to participate in operations, such as those described in the foregoing pages, without forming fixed opinions upon subjects connected with the organization of our armies, and the general conduct of military opera tions. This report would be incomplete without a brief allusion to some general con siderations which have been firmly impressed upon me by the events which have occurred. To my mind the most glaring defect in our armies is the absence of system in the appointment and promotion of general and other officers, and the want of means for the theoretical instruction of the mass of officers. The expansion of the army was so great and so rapid at the commencement of the existing war that it was perhaps impossible, in the great scarcity of instructed officers, to have adopted any other course than that which was pursued ; but the time has arrived when measures may be initiated to remedy existing defects, and provide against their recurrence. I think that the army should be regarded as a permanent one ; that is to say, its affairs should be administered precisely as if all who belonged to it had made it their profession for life ; and those rules for promotion, &c, which have been found necessary in the best foreign armies to excite honorable emulation, pro duce an esprit du corps and procure efficiency, should be followed by us. All officers and soldiers should be made to feel that merit \u2014 that is to say, courage, good conduct, the knowledge and performance of the duties of their grade, and fitness to exercise those of a superior grade \u2014 will insure to them ad vancement in their profession, and can alone secure it for them. Measures should be adopted to secure the theoretical instruction of staff of ficers at least, who should, as far as possible, be selected from officers having a military education, or who have seen actual service in the field. The number of cadets at the Military Academy should be at once increased to the greatest extent permitted by the capacity of the institution. The regular army should be increased and maintained complete in numbers and efficiency. A well-organized system of recruiting and of depots for instruction should he adopted, in order to keep the ranks of the regiments full, and supply promptly the losses arising from battle or disease. This is especially necessary for the artillery and cavalry arms of the service, which, from the beginning of the war, have rendered great services, and which have never been fully appreciated by any but their comrades. We need also large bodies of well-instructed engineer troops. In the arrangement and conduct of campaigns the direction should be left to"], [247, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 239 professional soldiers. A statesman may, perhaps, be more competent than a soldier to determine the political objects and direction of a campaign; but those once decided upon, everything should be left to the responsible military head, without interference from civilians. In no other manner is success probable. The meddling of individual members of committees of Congress with subjects which, from lack of experience, they are of course incapable of comprehending, and which they are too apt to view through the distorted medium of partisan or personal prejudice, can do no good, and is certain to produce incalculable mis chief. I cannot omit the expression of my thanks to the President for the constant evidence given me of his sincere personal regard, and his desire to sustain the military plans which my judgment led me to urge for adoption and execution. I cannot attribute his failure to adopt some of those plans, and to give that sup port to others which was necessary to their success, to any want of confidence in me ; and it only remains for me to regret that other counsels came between the constitutional commander-in-chief and the general whom he had placed at the head of his armies \u2014 counsels which resulted in the failure of great campaigns. If the nation possesses no generals in service competent to direct its military af fairs without the aid or supervision of politicians, the sooner it finds them and places them in position the better will it be for its fortunes. I may be pardoned for calling attention to the memorandum submitted by me to the President on the 4th of August, 1861 ; my letter to him of July 7, 1862 ; and other similar communications to him and to the Secretary of War. I have seen no reason to change in any material regard the views there ex pressed. After a calm, impartial, and patient consideration of the subject \u2014 a subject which demands the closest thought on the part of every true lover of his country \u2014 I am convinced that by the proper employment of our resources it is entirely possible to bring this war to a successful military issue. I believe that a necessary preliminary to the re-establishment of the Union is the entire de feat or virtual destruction of the organized military power of the confederates ; and that such a result should be accompanied and followed by conciliatory measures; and that by pursuing the political course I have always advised, it is possible to bring about a permanent restoration of the Union \u2014 a re-union by which the rights of both sections shall be preserved, and by which both parties shall preserve their self-respect, while they respect each other. In this report I have confined myself to a plain narrative of such facts as are necessary for the purposes of history. Where it was possible, I have preferred to give these facts in the language as despatches, written at the time of their occurrence, rather than to attempt a new relation. The reports of the subordinate commanders, hereto annexed, recite what time and space would fail me to mention here : those individual instances of con spicuous bravery and skill by which every battle was marked. To them I must especially refer, for without them this narrative would be incomplete, and justice fail to be done. But I cannot omit to tender to my corps commanders, and to other general officers under them, such ample recognition of their cordial co-operation and their devoted services as those reports abundantly avouch. I have not sought to defend the army which 1 had the honor to command, nor myself, against the hostile criticisms once so rife. It has seemed to me that nothing more was required than such a plain and truthful narrative to enable those whose right it is to form a correct judgment on the important matters involved. This report is, in fact, the history of the army of the Potomac. During the period occupied in the organization of that army, it served as a barrier against the advance of a lately victorious enemy, while the fortifications"], [248, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 240 of the capital were in progress ; and under the discipline which it then received it acquired strength, education, and some of that experience which is necessary to success in active operations, and which enabled it afterwards to sustain itself under circumstances trying to the most heroic men. Frequent skirmishes oc curred along the lines, conducted with great gallantry, which inured our troops to the realities of war. The army grew into shape but slowly ; and the delays which attended on the obtaining of arms, continuing late into the winter of 1861-'62, were no less trying to the soldiers than to the people of the country. Even at the time of the organization of the Peninsula campaign, some of the finest regiments were without rifles ; nor were the utmost exertions on the part of the military authori ties adequate to overcome the obstacles to active service. When, at length, the army was in condition to take the field, the Peninsula campaign was planned, and entered upon with enthusiasm by officers and men. Had this campaign been followed up as it was designed, I cannot doubt that it would have resulted in a glorious triumph to our arms, and the permanent re storation of the power of the government in Virginia and North Carolina, if not throughout the revolting States. It was, however, otherwise ordered, and instead of reporting a victorious campaign, it has been my duty to relate the heroism of a reduced army, sent upon an expedition into an enemy's country, there to abandon one and originate another and new plan of campaign, which might and would have been successful if supported with appreciation of its necessities, but which failed because of the repeated failure of promised support, at the most critical, and, as it proved, the most fatal moments. That heroism surpasses ordi nary description. Its illustration must be left for the pen of the historian in times of calm reflection, when the nation shall be looking back to the past from the midst of peaceful days. For me, now, it is sufficient to say that my comrades were victors on every field save one, and there the endurance of but little more than a single corps accomplished the object of the fighting, and, by securing to the army its transit to the James, left to the enemy a ruinous and barren victory. The army of the Potomac was first reduced by the withdrawal from my com mand of the division of General Blenker, which was ordered to the Mountain department, under General Fremont. We had scarcely landed on the Peninsula when it was further reduced by a despatch revoking a previous order giving me command at Fortress Monroe, and under which I had expected to take ten thousand men from that point to aid in our operations. Then, when under fire before the defences of Yorktown, we received the news of the withdrawal of General McDowell's corps of about 35,000 men. This completed the over throw of the original plan of the campaign. About one-third of my entire army (five divisions out of fourteen, one of the nine remaining being but little larger than a brigade) was thus taken from me. Instead of a rapid advance which I had planned, aided by a flank movement up the York river, it was only left to besiege Yorktown. That siege was successfully conducted by the army, and when these strong works at length yielded to our approaches, the troops rushed forward to the sanguinary but successful battle of Williamsburg, and thus opened an almost unresisted advance to the banks of the Chickahominy. Richmond lay before them, surrounded with fortifications, and guarded by an army larger than our own ; but the prospect did not shake the courage of the brave men who com posed my command. Relying still on the support which the vastness of our un dertaking and the grand results depending on our success seemed to insure us, we pressed forward. The weather was stormy beyond precedent : the deep soil of the Peninsula was at times one vast morass ; the Chickahominy rose to a higher stage than had been known for years before. Pursuing the advance, the crossings were seized, aud the right wing extended to effect a junction with re enforcements now promised and earnestly desired, and upon the arrival of which"], [249, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 241 the complete success of the campaign seemed clear. The brilliant battle of Han over Court House was fought, which opened the way for the first corps, with the aid of which, had it come, we should then have gone into the enemy's captial. It never came. The bravest army could not do more, under such overwhelming disappointment, than the army of the Potomac then did. Fair Oaks attests their courage and endurance when they hurled back, again and again, the vastly superior masses of the enemy. But mortal men could not accomplish the miracle that seemed to have been expected of them. But one course was left^-a flank march in the face of a powerful enemy to another and better base \u2014 one of the most hazardous movements in war. The army of the Potomac, hold ing its own safety and almost the safety of our cause, in its hands, was equal to the occasion. The seven days are classical in American history; those days in which the noble soldiers of the Union and Constitution fought an outnumbering enemy by day, and retreated from successive victories by night, through a week of battle, closing the terrible series of conflicts with the ever-memorable victory of Malvern, where they drove back, beaten and shattered, the entire eastern army of the confederacy, and thus secured for themselves a place of rest and a point for a new advance upon the capital from the banks of the James. Rich mond was still within our grasp, had the army of the Potomac been re-enforced and permitted to advance. But counsels, which I cannot but think subsequent events proved unwise, prevailed in Washington, and we were ordered to aban don the campaign. Never did soldiers better deserve the thanks of a nation than the army of the Potomac for the deeds of the Peninsula' campaign, and although that meed was withheld from them by the authorities, I am per suaded they have received the applause of the American people. The army of the Potomac was recalled from within sight of Richmond, and incorporated with the army of Virginia. The disappointments of the campaign on the Peninsula had not damped their ardor nor diminished their patriotism. They fought well, faithfully, gallantly, under General Pope ; yet were com pelled to fall back on Washington, defeated and almost demoralized. The enemy, no longer occupied in guarding his own capital, poured his troops northward, entered Maryland, threatened Pennsylvania, and even Washington itself. Elated by his recent victories, and assured that our troops were disor ganized and dispirited, he was confident that the seat of war was now perma nently transferred to the loyal States, and that his own exhausted soil was to be relieved from the burden of supporting two hostile armies. But he did not understand the spirit which animated the soldiers of the Union. I shall not, nor can I living, forget that when I was ordered to the command of the troops for the defence of the capital, the soldiers, with whom I had shared so much of the anxiety, and pain, and suffering of the war, had not lost their confidence in me as their commander. They sprang to my call with all their ancient vigor, discipline, and courage. I led them into Maryland. Fifteen days after they had fallen back defeated before Washington, they vanquished the enemy on the rugged height of South Mountain, pursued him to the hard-fought field of Antietam, and drove him, broken and disappointed, across the Potomac into Virginia. The army had need of rest. After the terrible experiences of battles and marches, with scarcely an interval of repose, which they had gone through from the time of leaving for the Peninsula ; the return to Washington ; the defeat in Viiginia; the victory at South Mountain, and again at Antietam, it was not sur prising that they were in a large degree destitute of the absolute necessaries to effective duty Shoes were worn out; blankets were lost; clothing was in raes \u2022 in short, the army was unfit for active service, and an interval for rest and equipment was necessary. When the slowly forwarded supplies came to us I led the army across the 'river, renovated, refreshed, in good order and discipline, H. Ex. Doc. 15 16"], [250, "REPORT OF GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. 242 and followed the retreating foe to a position where I was confident of decisive victory, when, in the midst of the movement, while my advance guard was ac tually in contact with the enemy, I was removed from the command. I am devoutly grateful to God that my last campaign with this brave army was crowned with a victory which saved the nation from the greatest peril it had then undergone. I have not accomplished my purpose if, by this report, the army of the Potomac is not placed high on the roll of the historic armies of the world. Its deeds ennoble the nation to which it belongs. Always ready for battle, always firm, steadfast, and trustworthy, I never called on it in vain ; nor will the nation ever have cause to attribute its want of success, under myself, or under other commanders, to any failure of patriotism or bravery in that noble body of American soldiers. No man can justly charge upon any portion of that army, from the command ing general to the private, any lack of devotion to the service of the United States government, and to the cause of the Constitution and the Union. They have proved their fealty in much sorrow, suffering, danger, and through the very shadow of death. Their comrades dead on all the fields where we fought have scarcely more claim to the honor of a nation's reverence than their surj vivors to the justice of a nation's gratitude.
