The good-bye which Joanna Endicott had given, half aloud, Avas wrung from her by a desperate resolution, taken under desperate circumstances. She Avas standing, on a fine- October day, midAvay betAveen the door of her father's house and the garden gate, not many yards distant from the house. It was one of those old country houses, half manor-house, half farmhouse, of which Devonshire has many. The place had some pretensions because of its very homely anticputy ; but, instead of the air of comfort and plenty Avhich ought to have distinguished the d.velling of a yeoman squire before bad times had become chronic, it shoAved many tokens of neglect, and of what was probably narroAv means."], [15, "'GOOD-BYE!' 3 The tall privet hedge, which was all that divided the small front garden from a country road, was straggling, ragged, and broken down in one or two places. A sundial and a curiously constructed stack of variegated holly had formed the central ornaments of a grass-plot bordered with superannuated sweet briar, honeysuckle, and lilac bushes \u2014 the last sturdy survivors of more choice and delicate shrubs. The iron nose of the sundial was broken off. The holly-bush, after it had been kept carefully clipped in prosaic rotundity for many a year, had latterly been left to its OAvn devices, and had exercised its liberty in two Avays. A degenerate shoot of the ordinary dark green holly had usurped the place of eminence, and surmounted the stiff round of the variegated holly with a wildly luxuriant bush, stretching out adventurous branches, as thickly studded with red berries at Christ mas as if the original plant had never known the severe discipline of gardeners' shears.

By the rustic brown porch and the grey mullioned windows the eldest of the fuchsia tribe in England kept its ground, as tall as a small tree, full of slim boughs, bearing dark green thick-set leaves, and a countless abun dance of gem-like little flowers, which shone hke rubies in the summer sunshine, and still made a brave attempt at a ruddy glow in their sheltered nook in October. The old fuchsia did more than keep its ground : it had instituted a couple of irregular hedges running along the two outer sides of the porch. These fuchsia hedges were swept bare every autumn, and in severe winters had been killed to the ground ; but they revived in spring, and grew apace to make up for the chances of Avar. On the right hand of Blackhall lay the village of Oxcleeve, amidst arable fields now bare.

The broken links of a Avhite thread diversified the monotony of the dark moor just below Blackhall. The thread was the river Bar, which had a cleeve, a few spinneys, and half a dozen pools or meres all to itself. For anything else Avhich this corner of the moor could show, there were occasional groups and rows of trees \u2014 firs or birches \u2014 wind-tossed and gnarled ; a packman's bridge ; farther off an ancient cross, which required the learned to recognise that it was a cross at all ; and at a still greater distance several huge blocks of lichen-covered stone standing on end.

Yet the good-bye for ever to Blackhall was said voluntarily by a girl Avho had been born and reared there, and had hardly left the \"neighbourhood in the whole course of her life ; the very one of all its daughters, of the various families to which the old house had belonged, since it Avas built in another age and another England, Avho had probably loved it best, with a passionate attachment made up of the threefold strands of three dif ferent motives.

She had little else to care for and be"], [19, "'GOOD-BYE!' 7 proud of. But, in spite of everything, the words Avere spoken With dry eyes and a hard set mouth. The next minute the speaker, Joanna Endicott, turned and walked into the house. Beyond the threshold, the evidence of care and attention withdrawn, and of the necessary means no longer spent to stop the progress of decay and keep the house in tolerable repair, was much more conspicuous. Outside, the solid masonry of former generations offered a strong passive resistance to the assaults of time in summer's sun and winter's storm, while Nature's kindly touch and healing groAvth hid many a breach. But within the house the Avails of the hall were iniide .ved and moulder ing. Spiders were spinning their Avebs in the corners. The canvases of several worthless old pictures were starting from their frames. The contents of sundry boxes which had con tained stuffed birds had degenerated into bird skeletons together Avith some handfuls of feathers and dust. One of the high lattice"], [20, "8 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS Avindows on either side of the door was broken, and the shattered diamond panes were replaced by nothing better than a wooden board. The waxcloth which covered the stone floor Avas cracked and rent, and where it had not broken into holes presented a network of coarse threads \u2014 a trap for unwary feet. The stair case of oak, black with age, had more than one unsightly gap where the tAvisted rails ought to have been. Both dining-room and drawing-room opened from the hall. Joanna entered the latter. It Avas a faded, soiled, dispiriting room, Avhich had been last furnished with the sliOAvy finery that was in fashion twenty years before. Hangings and carpet had lost their gay colours, and were stained and worn with not over-careful or gentle usage. Mirrors and china were cracked, with feet and handles wanting. Gilding was dim and dirty. The springs of a chair here and a sofa there had given Avay, while the cushions were crushed flat as if they had not been shaken up for a"], [21, "'GOOD-BYE!' 9 period of years. Lounges and couches, origi nally intended to be elegant and luxurious, no longer retained claims to common respecta bility or to imparting ordinary ease to those persons who Avere so unfortunate as to sit doAvn on them. A footstool had been kicked over without having been set on its feet again, and held up to public scorn a fractured leg and the side of its cover in a fringe of rags. Three additional touches were lent to the domestic desolation. There Avas not the ves tige of a book or of needleAvork to be seen. The fire was smouldering in an ill-cleaned grate, above a heap of ashes. Some flower jars, which had had autumn floAvers put into them a week before, stood with Avhat ought to have been their fresh and fragrant contents withered and drooping. A more hopeless, heartless room than the drawing-room at Blackhall at this date could not Avell be imagined Those who knew the house and the history of its OAvner were aware that both he and it"], [22, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 10 were going to destruction Avith long swift strides. Still it was in the natural order of things that the women's quarters should look more wrecked and dismal than the man's,' richly as he deserved the Avorst locality that could fall to his lot. The furniture in the dining-room had been, like the house itself, made to last. Compared to it, that of the draAving-room had been flimsy and garish. It Avould have required still more rough daily usage and violent habits of spurning a table in this direction and pitching a chair in that to have worked much mischief to the three piled Brussels carpet, the heavy mahogany, the strong leather, and the thick cloth. As one result of this sliding scale of ruin at Blackhall, Hugh Endicott had long ago aban doned the drawing-room to the use of the women of the family, Avho had almost no visitors. He never put a foot in it except on particular occasions. It was enough to provoke a shiver to think of a young woman, with every token of health"], [23, "'GOOD-BYE!' 11 and strength in her blooming face and erect firm gait, in such a wretched, neglected room, for which the humblest cottage, where the floor was clean-swept and the hearth bright, would have been a blessed change. Joanna Endicott did not seem to notice anything wrong with the cheerless room. She acted as if her mind were too full of something else for her to see the inanimate objects around her. Yet as she passed one of the jars Avith the withered flowers, she plucked, consciously or unconsciously, a sprig of rose mary from the nosegay and pressed it between her fingers, while she walked straight to the only person present and prepared to address her. This was a woman hardly past her prime, who sat sunk in a Ioav rocking-chair, tilting it mechanically backwards and for wards on one side of the hearth, with an inde scribably monotonous and oppressive move ment. The figure was as sad to see as the room ; for it Avould have been difficult to discover a"], [24, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 12 more pitiable prime of womanhood than that which was, not to say displayed, but kept huddled in the background by Mrs. Hugh Endicott. She looked more like a beaten dog than a chidden and punished child. She could never have borne the slightest resem blance to her daughter Joanna. Mother and daughter differed at every point. The mother had ahvays been a httle woman, and had become shrunken before her time. The daughter was tall and broad-shouldered for her years. Mrs. Endicott's was a weak face \u2014 so weak that the absence of all power in it might have been some excuse for many of her faults. Joanna Endicott's was a strong face, whether for good or evil. Those who had known the old family at Blackhall said she was a true Endicott, Avhile she took not so much after her father as after his sisters and aunts, who had all died or left the place long before.

Its owner had not the sense to dis pose of it under any save the smallest and least shrouding of caps ; and it must have done her positive harm in the eyes of suscep tible, dogmatic people. There Avas something light-headed in the golden hair of a woman of forty \u2014 a woman with a most unhappy history, and a heavily clouded reputation, which nothing on earth would ever clear. There is a touch of the irony of fate when conditions over which we have no control convert Avhat was once a cherished and ac-"], [26, "14 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS knowledged boon into a source of detriment and loss. There had been a time Avhen Mrs. Endicott's pale golden hair \u2014 a httle more luxuriant in those days \u2014 had been considered, ahke by herself and her neighbours, one of her greatest attractions, when it was quite in keeping with her girlish delicacy of complexion and her coy blue eyes. It was that very hair and those eyes Avhich had won the roving fancy of Hugh Endicott of Blackhall, though he had lived to curse what he had come to reckon the meretricious yellow colour of the one and the false furtive glances of the other. If Mrs. Hugh Endicott had been a pretty, lively young Avoman, in rather a childish, giddy way, she was anything save a hand some bountiful matron as she approached middle age. She was a shaken, scared, half spent creature where she lay back clutching at the arms of the rocking-chair. Her cheeks were pinched ; her weak eyes Avere dim with many a long day of Aveariness and despair. Her mouth, in which several of what had"], [27, "'GOOD-BYE!' 15 once been the small white teeth were either broken or gone, leaving dreary gaps like the missing rails in the staircase, was the very picture of forlornness and fright. Her pallid face had no colour, unless in the streaks and patches of broken red which emotions of terror and shame brought there. Mrs. Endicott's dress did nothing to im prove her appearance. Like the furniture in the room, it was far past its best ; and that, too, had been a smart and showy best, which looked doubly ill in the sere and yellow leaf. Her gown was of the stiff flowered silk called Pompadour, the design of which was gay little groups of red, white, purple, and yellow flowers in satin, on a darker silk ground ; and it had been profusely trimmed with lace. At this date the stiffness of the material was lost in innumerable crumples and creases ; the satin flowers were frayed past recognition, and the holes of the lace had magnified them selves into yawning vacancies, which had no place in the pattern. The jaunty cap in its"], [28, "16 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS smoked batteredness was a melancholy ghost of Avhat it ought to haATe been. Mrs. Hugh Endicott had not been either Avise or good, else she could hardly have come to the pass at which she had arrived ; but even in proportion to the offence the punish ment had been terrible. Her history can be summed up in a few words ; the torture of it, as she continued, poor creature though she was, capable of natural feehng, no language can express. She had married, when a silly frivolous girl, a man rather above her in status ; for she Avas only the daughter of a captain in the coastguard, and her husband was Hugh En dicott of Blackball \u2014 a squire, no doubt, of land won from the moor for the most part, whose acres were more numerous than fertile, still a squire of good descent, and if he was not rich, neither was he then poverty-stricken. She was foolish and vain, fond of the idle gaiety she had known as a girl in a seaport and garrison toAvn, Avhich she could no longer"], [29, "'GOOD-BYE !' 17 hope to command, and of the half-shallow, half-coarse admiration that a woman of a more robust nature or a finer mind would have despised. She hated the moor district, when she came to know it better, with a half childish hatred not unmixed with shivering fear. She was also extravagant in a number of senseless petty personal extravagances \u2014 peculiarly exasperating in their very pettiness and selfishness to a man soon struggling with a millstone of debt round his neck. He was a man of hot temper and stormy passions. It was in him from the first to be relentlessly, barbarously cruel, given a certain amount of provocation. Still he had married her from choice, and love of a sort. He was not a monster. He still cared in his vehement, fitful, tyrannical fashion for the children she had borne him, long after he had ceased to care for her. He had some respect for his character, though he had been styled ' wild Endicott ' even Avhen he was a lad. He did mind the opinion vol. 1. c"], [30, "18 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS of the world for more than one decade of his later life ; and it was just possible that if he had been tolerably prosperous, or even any thing save horribly unfortunate, the couple might have pulled along together ; wrangling continually, so far as shrill hysterical protests alternating with cowardly evasions and cun ning deceptions could be called wrangling on her part ; falling out more furiously by way of variety now and then ; but never coming to any direct rupture or open scandal. But Hugh Endicott speculated in cattle, sheep, and little moor-bred horses, in new manures for new land, even in the last remains of the metals of the ancients still to be found in these localities. He failed disastrously in all. His misfortunes, which he had neither ac quired principle nor natural patience to bear, and, bearing like a man, to grow tAvice a man by the stern experience, goaded him to mad ness. He grew always more of a bully and tyrant both at home and abroad, but espe cially at home, till his tyranny was not only"], [31, "'GOOD-BYE!' 19 hateful but intolerable to an erring woman not made of the stuff of Avhich saints and martyrs are made. She also was baited to madness, till she Avas about to take a step as reckless, and if possible more Avicked than any of which her husband had been guilty. She planned to break God's laAv and man's by fleeing from her husband, forsaking her children, and abandoning the path of virtue on earth and the hope of heaven hereafter. She brought herself to the brink of an elopement with a rascally old admirer of hers, Avho had sunk from more genteel callings to end as an offi cer in the excise. He had been sent to Ox cleeve to check illicit practices for which the moor afforded facilities, and there he had once more come across an early flame. He Avas reduced in circumstances like herself, and had no more attractive game to pursue. He was so Ioav in his fortunes and discontented with his shabby lot that he did not much care Avhat befell him, while he had a keen c 2"], [32, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 20 relish for notoriety. He persuaded himself that he was very sorry for the badly treated wife and downtrodden woman Avhom he had ogled, Avith whom he had flirted when she was chattering, dancing Cecilia Lowndes \u2014 light-hearted enough, poor thing. He knew that there would be a certain shady eclat in coming to the rescue (!) of Mrs. Endicott of Blackhall and running away Avith her. The evil deed was frustrated in the doing. The purpose of the pair became known to Hugh Endicott. Before Mrs. Endicott had gone many hundred yards from home on such an errand, in the dawn of a summer morning of all times, before she had joined Jack Morgan at their rendezvous, she came face to face with the husband on whom she was about to inflict a deadly injury. He stopped her, charging her with the sin she had meditated, which, in spite of her guilt, she could not deny. He brought her back a disgraced and terrified culprit to the shelter of his roof."], [33, "'GOOD-BYE!' 21 He did not put her aAvay afterwards ; he did not take her children from her. Yet either course would have been infinitely more merciful than that which he adopted. There was not a day on which she came into his presence that he did not remind her of what he had saved her from, in order to drag her through the bitter waters of his accusations and reproaches. He taunted her before her children, from whom she shrank painfully abashed ; before her servants, to whom she was an object of a little pity and a great scorn. He would have taunted her before her visitors also, but, as no attempt had been made to hide the ugly episode in the family history, no visitors for Mrs. Endicott came any more to Blackhall. Her very relations, who were at least respectable, whom she had affronted, did not take her part, but left her to her miserable fate. Mrs. Endicott's accomplice in Avrong-doing, on whom Hugh Endicott had not sought to wreak his revenge, because, as he had assured"], [34, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 22 his wife, she was too worthless a possession for the chance of her loss to be revenged, had been removed in the natural course of his service from Oxcleeve, and was stationed at some distance, from Avhich, though he bra zened out his share of the offence, he Avas rarely seen or heard of in the neighbourhood of Blackball. It did seem as if the Avoman were aban doned both by God and man ; but the depth of her degradation raised for her a human helper \u2014 surely the faint shadow of a divine Deliverer."], [35, "23 CHAPTER II. A PARTING. Mrs. Endicott was the mother of four living children, with long gaps betAveen the ages of some of them, caused by the deaths of other children born to her -and Hugh Endicott, whose pale still faces, and hands and feet for ever at rest, had not established peace be tAveen the father and mother, bereaved in common ; neither had they prevented her from bringing on the unconscious little ones, Avhere they lay in their graves, the reproach that attends on the children of a Avanton mother. The eldest of the surviving children Avas Joanna, born and bred at Blackhall. The second, Jem, was a boy of twelve, for Avhom Hugh Endicott had shown a degree of consideration. The boy had not been made"], [36, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 24 a frequent Avitness to the abasement of his mother. He had been sent off to school and kept there, not always returning even for the holidays during the last five years. His father Avent to see him at long intervals ; his mother, or, for that matter, the rest of the family, never. The prohibition Avas one of the scorpions with which Mrs. Endicott Avas lashed ; for she had been fond of her only son, and it was hard for her to think that she was seldom to set eyes on his face till he and she had groAvn strange to each other, till he had learnt in all probability to Avince at the thought of his mother. The two younger children Avere little girls still, not more than six and seven, in blessed ignorance of the blight on their home. Mrs. Endicott might have had some pride and pleasure in their rosy beauty, merry pranks, and fondling caresses, if she had not been crushed and smitten beyond taking pride and pleasure in anything. Besides, here too Hugh Endicott interposed and stripped hfe of all compensa-"], [37, "A PARTING 25 tion to her. After his bearish fashion he made pets of his younger children. And he not only chose to stand first with them : he would not suffer even a slender share of their notice and regard to be withdrawn from them, and wasted, as he reckoned, on their mother. He confiscated such dolls and sweets as she had found means to bestow on the children, and made it a condition of his favour that they should have nothing to do with her. He encouraged their nurse to tell tales which would expose and prevent Mrs. Endicott's interference in the nursery Avhich she had once ruled. Little Celia obeyed her father to the letter, and broke aAvay from her mother every time they were together ; but Lucy, though she had a secret dread of her father, shpped away and hung about her ' own mamma ' whenever she had the oppor tunitv. Had they not been mother and daughter, it would have been natural for a girl like Joanna Endicott to recoil from such a"], [38, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 26 woman as her mother \u2014 to have done more than recoil ; to have judged and condemned her harshly. But she was her mother, and that, in the circumstances, meant much. Joanna Avas not like other girls, she herself reflected with a sore and swelling heart ; for had not the knoAvledge of evil with its end, which Avas death, and its fruit, which Avas ashes, been forced upon her in what ought to have been her tenderly shielded days, and made her old before her time ? The knoAvledge in its entirety might be a saving knowledge ; but it felt to her as if it Avere burnt in upon her consciousness, on her very bearing, like a terrible brand. But along with the knowledge she had a keen sense of the penalty exacted. She had grown up grievously familiar with the insults and injuries heaped upon the sinner ; and in this case familiarity had not bred contempt, or even indifference. On the contrary, it had given birth to a passionate yearning to pro tect and deliver the Aveak and oppressed."], [39, "A PARTING 27 Joanna was strong herself \u2014 strong in her youth and vigour, and in a nature totally different from her mother's \u2014 if it must be said, derived in part from her father's before his had run riot and deteriorated fearfully, sinking to a lower level than that to which his victims had fallen, since the stronger has the greater capacity for evil as for everything else. All that was generous in Joanna's strength was stirred to rise up in defence of the downtrodden and desolate, of the mother who had borne her, with regard to whom Joanna had the anguish of seeing her every day humbled in the dust, and that before her young daughter, before the little ignorant children Celia and Lucy. The girl was full of indignant pity for her mother even while she tried Joanna, as Mrs. Endicott had tried everybody with whom she had been connected, by her folly, fickle ness, and coAvardice.

For him she had no-"], [40, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 28 thing save indignant condemnation, rising at times into fierceness, in a temper not Avholly dissimilar from Avhat his had been. She ignored all relenting on his part where she was concerned. She resented and rejected every overture to such indulgence as he had in his power to grant her, which now and then he made to her. She was not hkely to reject such advances long ; Hugh Endicott, even in his youth, Avould not have stood many repulses. If Joanna made great mistakes, and was in her turn intolerant and unmerciful, there is this to be said for her : she was very young, and she had nobody to put confidence in, nobody to advise her ; she was as lonely a girl as was in England. When Joanna Endicott came forward to her mother on this October afternoon the girl's voice and manner were not those of an ordinary daughter to an ordinary mother, happy, though they may not know it, in the simplicity of their relations. The tone and"], [41, "A PARTING 29 manner were, in fact, those of the superior and not of the inferior, the ruler instead of the ruled. For Mrs. Endicott had thrown down her motherly as well as her wifely rights on that ill-fated summer morning Avhen she had stolen from her husband's house not meaning to return to it, but designing to relinquish everything Avhich ought to have been dearest to her, and to fling herself into such arms as those of the low scapegrace Jack Morgan. But there was no unkindness in Joanna's accent of authority. There was even an effort at gentleness \u2014 a quality which at this period of her life did not come by any means readily to an inmate of Blackhall whose usual frame of mind was one of hot wrath and breathless impatience. ' Mother,' said Joanna, ' you are ready ? \u2014 you have promised. I have settled every thing : we are to go to-night.' ' Oh, Anna, I cannot do it ! ' said the woman, shivering and trembling. ' It .vas all"], [42, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 30 very Avell to speak of doing it Avhen it was at a distance, but Avhen it comes to the point I cannot. I tried to go once before, and you know \u2014 you kno av what came of it.' And she hung her dishonoured head, with its unsuit able scanty yelloAV hair like a mockery, as she remembered the guilt she had agreed to, and the retribution which had dogged her heels. ' But this is altogether different,' said Joanna, turning aside her head and flushing hotly. She spoke half vehemently, half Avearilv ; for the argument Avas unanswerable to herself, and she had gone over it many times Avith the same opponent. ' There is nothing wrong in what Ave are going to do \u2014 at least, if there is anything with which people Avho know nothing of the circumstances can find fault, we are forced to do it. There is no other Avay. You are going with me, mother ?

She ended a little wildly, pulling out her handkerchief \u2014 a torn one \u2014 and fanning herself with it, though the fire was nearly out, and the day was cold, with a suspicion of frost in the moorland air. ' But you cannot go Avithout me ; you can never manage by yourself,' remonstrated Joanna with an air of beAvilderment, though she was generally clear-headed. ' Never mind me,' said her mother fever ishly. ' I don't want to have your ruin to ansAver for as well as my own. Blackhall is a poor home \u2014 I have sometimes been tempted to think it a hell upon earth ; but it is better than no home, and it need not be so bad for you as it has been for me. He has no charge"], [44, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 32 to bring against you, unless that you have had some pity and affection for your miserable mother, and surely that may be forgiven you in time. If I were gone, and you did not knoAv where I Avas, he would not even have that complaint to bring against you. He used to be fond and proud of you when you were a child and a half-grown girl ; I believe he is to this day, if you Avould only let him.

' You may depend upon it that it is one thing to enter life the daughter of Endicott of Blackhall, though he has squan dered his means and been no better than a ruffian to me, and another thing to face the world disoAvned and cast off by him, as good as the daughter of nobody.' ' What do I care for being the daughter of Endicott of Blackhall ? ' broke in Joanna indignantly. ' It is no honour ; it is a dis-"], [45, "A PARTING 33 grace. Is this a place to be proud of ?

' Are you afraid of his hearing me ? ' demanded Joanna, Avith a smile that had more ghastiiness than gladness in it on the soft red lips. ' I don't care if he did ; it Avould bring matters to a crisis.' ' Girl ! ' gasped Mrs. Endicott, ' that is nut the Avorst.

But, mother, there is something you are hiding from me : Avhat is it ? ' cried Joanna, suddenly turning upon Mrs. Endicott and fixing her shifting eyes with her oavii steady gaze. Then every shade of colour fled, and left Joanna's face as white as a sheet. She set her teeth hard, and even ground them for an instant as her father might have done in her place. ' Is it possible,' she said in alow voice, whose vibrating tones nevertheless cut the hearer's ears like sharp steel, ' that you are thinking again of that detestable man, that scamp and scoundrel ?

'I'll keep you \u2014 if not like a queen, at least better than you are kept here. We'll be free and together \u2014 think of that ! ' The thought did not seem to stimulate Mrs. Endicott. She was clearly casting about in her mind for another obstacle which she might bring forward. ' How can you ask me"], [52, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 40 to leave my children, Anna ? ' She caught at the idea, and appealed afresh to her daughter. ' My two baby girls \u2014 dear little Celia and Lucy \u2014 you might have guessed that my love for them \u2014 a mother's love for her little ones, her youngest pets \u2014 should outweigh every other consideration in the end. Hoav could you think that I should go away to America while they Avere to stay behind ? ' Joanna stood silent.

You proposed to cut yourself off from them, and Jem and me, yet more hopelessly than I am suggesting to you to do noAv. It is not you : it is I who ought to pause and think, before I abandon my poor little sisters, and Jem at school, and all that I have known of a home, for you.' It is likely enough that she thought all this, for she was a straightforward, truthful girl in her very thoughts ; but she did not say it.

' How could you,' cried Joanna indignantly, ' when you knew it was risking everything ? Fortunately it is too late to do more mischief, mother.' She resumed more calmly if a little coldly, ' You must be a Avare that you are parted from Celia and Lucy, as it is, in the most disastrous, most cruel fashion ; that they are growing up in a house divided against itself \u2014 which is the worst thing possible for"], [54, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 42 them.

' I think I should prefer to be starved or killed at once,' said Joanna Avith ominous composure ; ' and we'll not stay where Ave are : it is less to be borne now than ever.'

His"], [56, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 44 nose, his lips, his very fingers, had thickened and broadened. His high colour had deep ened to crimson ; his hair was heavily grizzled. His old bold, self-asserting glance had passed into a defiant scowl. In his rough suit and gaiters he had the air of one of the worst looking of the moor-men \u2014 who might also be a fugitive from justice, a smuggler or illicit distiller, a criminal on his own account. Hugh Endicott might well have passed on any stage for the ruffian his wife said he was to her. Yet he had been a man of birth and education, for a native of the wilds. The great moors of Devonshire remained in some measure wilds twenty or thirty years ago. If their annals are ransacked examples of ruder characters than Hugh Endicott may be found among their gentry, among their very clergy ; though no doubt the quintessence of such Ishmaelitish men and of their lawless deeds dates further back still. Hugh Endicott was comparatively tamed. He advanced straight to Mrs. Endicott as"], [57, "A PARTING 45 Joanna had done, but with another purpose. In the first place, he ordered her with an oath to stop the idiotic rocking of her beastly cradle of a chair. A charming innocent baby she was, to be sure, with that moulted yellow mop of a head of hers, and those holes in her mouth ! She obeyed with piteous quivering haste that defeated its object and kept the chair vibrating for some seconds in spite of her, as if she had refused to comply with his will.

' If you do not believe me, Anna will tell you ' Woman, do you appeal to your daughter on such a point ? ' he cried, with disgust that nearly choked him, and then he fell back into his former tone.

We all know what you Avould not have scrupled to do years ago, if I had not been before you.' With the final brutal taunt he left her Avrithing, sobbing, and cowering in her chair. As he was about to pass out of the room his eye caught sight of his daugther Joanna standing hke stone upon the hearth-rug.

Mrs. Endicott was in the habit of keeping her room in the morning ; but Avhen her eldest daughter Avas sought for, and could nowhere be found, another search Avas instituted for the mother, and proved equally fruitless.

He did not take more deliberate measures to trace and arrest the pair after he had discovered that the fugitives had got the start of him by more than t .velve hours. He appeared utterly callous to the fact that one of the lost women was his daughter, under age and innocent till that night of any act Avhich could in the slightest degree compromise her character.

For these steps might have been rewarded by the rescue at least of the missing girl from a fate worse than death, the most lamentable that could befall a Avoman. But there never was the smallest appear ance of such relenting in Hugh Endicott."], [65, "REAPING THE WHIRLWIND 53 What he did was sternly to forbid thence forth the mention of the names of his wife and eldest daughter in his presence, and to cause the removal of every trace of their existence from their former home. He treated them as both alike stained and sunk beyond the hope of reconciliation and right of recog nition in the place Avhich had once known them, but Avas to know them no more. Joanna Endicott had, indeed, said her good-bye for ever on that October day to the familiar features of Blackhall and the early associations of her life. There was nobody actually entitled to interfere on her hehalf. With the exception of Hugh Endicott himself, his family were dead and gone. Her rela tions on the mother's side had been too much separated from her, and were themselves people with their heads too little above the troubled waters of the struggling middle-class world to bestir themselves and try to reverse the hard sentence which her ovra conduct had draAvn down upon her deA'oted head. They"], [66, "54 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS might not condemn her utterly without a hearing as her father had done, but they could not fail to regard the step she had taken in leaving Blackhall Avithout his know- ledge and consent, in the company of her mother, as grossly reckless and undutiful. If they had been joined by Morgan, the partner of the old baffled elopement, Avho, though he was considered hard up in his circumstances, had probably furnished the means for the second and double flight, Joanna Endicott's behaviour, if it Avas not so evil as her father said, Avas worse than reckless and undutiful ; it was so Avrong and unnatural that it de served almost any punishment which it could bring upon her. The relations Avhom her mother had already disgraced were not likely to be lenient to this fresh offence in Avhich the daughter took part. The outer Avorld, that had nothing to do Avith the Endicotts beyond having a know ledge of their existence and of something of their grim and grievous history, Avas not"], [67, "REAPING THE WHIRLWIND 55 altogether unjust and unmerciful. There were people even in the neighbourhood of Blackhall who maintained that Hugh Endi cott had put the crown on his iniquities when he thus gaATe up his young daughter without an effort to save her, abandoning her to the care of a Avoman whose care was worse than none. He threw the first stone at the already tottering fabric of Joanna's fair fame by judging and sentencing her in the same breath with the mother whose reputation had long been ruined, for no reason save that Joanna had been her persecuted mother's champion and was her companion in flight, even if that flight were viewed in the worse light \u2014 as one to which Jack Morgan was a party, in which he figured along Avith the two misguided women.

She had always shoAvn herself rather practical than romantic, and they be lieved her adventure was more the result of the desperate misdirected energy of a naturally active-minded enterprising nature goaded into action, than the blundering of the habitual dreamer of distorted fantastic dreams. George Fielding, the lawyer's son, was Joanna's most resolute, indignant defender ; which some people thought generous and some foohsh in the young man, though he was known in other respects to be no fool. It was tolerably well understood that George, on his return from college in order to enter into partnership with his father, had been smitten by the handsome girl in her lonehness with her high spirit, and had been repulsed by her in his overtures, as she was"], [69, "REAPING THE WHIRL WLND 57 known to have repelled every advance made to her friendship since she grew up. This might have been in the mad pride of the Endicotts, which Avild Hugh had shared in his day, though the Fieldings Avere more than a match for the squire of Blackhall in his later fortunes ; or it might have been in some secret consciousness that such honest over tures and honest companionship were not really those Avhich were craved by a radically tainted nature \u2014 tainted not only by inherit ance, but by constant association with her mother. George Fielding had continued even after his rebuff one of the few persons on friendly terms with the Endicotts, including Joanna, who had been his playmate when they were boy and girl together. It might be that he was patient in his superior strength and bided his time. It might be that he had a large enough heart and mind to comprehend some what that poor Joanna, her whole soul rent by the woeful conflict within herself as well as"], [70, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 58 within her family, was not in circumstances to yield Avithout difficulty to softer influences, to be Avilling to abandon her mother to her fate, and carry the disgrace which Mrs. Endicott had brought on her children to another hearth, and that an honourable one.

Anyhow, Avhen George Fielding had first been told of the disastrous event by his father in their office at Ashford, one morning when they were alone together, the clerks having been purposely sent out of the way by the head of the firm, the son had"], [71, "REAPING THE WHIRLWIND 59 instantly asserted his conviction of Joanna's comparative innocence. Mr. Fielding had said, ' Something far amiss has happened over at Blackhall, George \u2014 something that you will not hke to hear.

That miserable sinner Endicott has not put his wretched wife out of pain, but she has run away again ; Joanna has gone with her, and they say the rascal Morgan is in their company.' ' The last is a lie, whoever says it,' said George Fielding, with such invincible in credulity that it lent him coolness with which to meet the rest of the statement. Then he remembered that at Joanna's request lie had procured a httle money for her private use, and told his father the circumstance, satisfied that the elder man would give it what weight it deserved in the light of evidence of the girl's intention to act independently of Morgan, though in the past Mr. Fielding had simply"], [72, "60 THE BLACK HALL GHOSTS tolerated and not actively countenanced the prospect of having Joanna Endicott for a daughter-in-law.

But not all that either of the Fieldings, in company with the more merciful and liberal spirits round Oxcleeve, could say or do in condonation of Joanna Endicott's serious offence against family and social laws, and in defence of her motives, could keep the scandal from taking deep root. It sent forth numerous shoots and tendrils which clung to her name. When a long period of years passed, and nothing certain or trustworthy was heard either of Joanna Endicott or her mother, or for that matter of the black sheep Morgan, in their old neighbourhood, the less conscientious and charitable portion of the community arrived at the conclusion \u2014 with what spiteful satisfaction to themselves they"], [73, "REAPING THE WHIRLWIND 61 only could have told \u2014 that Joanna had indeed gone the way of her mother ; a way so little to their credit that the best thing which could happen for them, and for the world against which they had sinned, was that their very memories, unpleasant and unprofitable, should be forgotten. Whether it was retribution or in the more natural sequence of habits and acts, it was a fact that Hugh Endicott's downward progress became not only largely accelerated, but unspeakably darker, drearier, and more hideous from that day. He floundered on among his debts and speculations for a little while, getting continually blinder, madder, less honest, nearer fraud and crime, till no respectable man would be seen in his com pany. He swaggered, and swore, and struck at those unfortunate satellites who were left with him when they opposed his will, till he was summoned to appear in a law court more than once or twice for disgraceful acts of personal violence. His creditors could not"], [74, "62 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS seize and seU his estate, because it went by entail, mortgaged and stripped as it was, to his son Jem ; but they sold Hugh Endicott out to the last article he could call his own. In their rage and disgust they put up some of his very clothes to auction, and had them knocked down for a few odd shillings and pence. At this point, when Endicott of Blackhall was wandering about hke a vagabond, a raging lunatic, with hardly a change of raiment, or a penny to buy food to keep body and soul together, existing on the extorted alms of old acquaintances who blushed for him while he gave them no thanks, his best word to them being a curse on their niggardliness, his wife's relations did step in. They took upon them, for common decency's sake, with much grumbling and grudging, the maintenance of Jem at school and the sole charge of the two little girls Celia and Lucy. At last Hugh Endicott crept back to Blackhall, to the house which had been his"], [75, "REAPING THE WHIRLWIND 63 father's and his own, and was still his son's. It was bare of aU save a few sticks of old furniture which nobody would be at the trouble to carry off the premises. The house had been falling to pieces for years, until it was impossible to let it without extensive repairs, which could not be undertaken, in the circumstances, till Jem Endicott came of age. But in the meantime it afforded a poor shelter for a social outcast ; all the servants were gone except one old woman, who clung to ' t'owd ha' and t'owd squire,' half be cause she had no kindred or friend of her own to cling to, half because of the fidelity to places which women share with cats, and to persons, which they may share with the angels. In this state, lying on a bed which was borrowed, Hugh Endicott was attacked by a deadly, agonising, and loathsome disease, against which he fought like a wild beast. His sohtary attendant was often in mortal terror of going near him lest he should wreak"], [76, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 64 his fury upon her by the help of any instru ment that came to his hand. The clergyman and the doctor of the parish, the duties of whose callings brought them reluctantly to the dying man's side, vowed solemnly many a time, in spite of the obligations of their offices, to quit his pre sence and never return to it, sooner than remain Avitnesses to his horrible savagery and blasphemy. At last torture and the poison in his system did their worst against a frame natu rally as enduring in its vigour as that of a moorland bull or an oak. Hugh Endicott gasped out his last breath without one of his blood or a friend to close his eyes. His soul went to meet its Judge ; his worn-out body was buried out of sight with the bodies of better men who had gone before him. There was still an interval till Jem was major, during which Blackhall continued tenantless.

But beyond this obstinacy of temper, to gether with a certain unamiable gruffness not untouched by gloom, Jem happily did not show any other of his father's attributes. He was steady enough, after his own fashion ; and it was understood not only that he bore the hardships of his lot in stern silence, but that he was painfully pinching and saving from the scanty returns the land brought him, in order if possible to redeem the property. As it was, with all his scraping and paring, all his moiling and toiling, retaining the best fields in his own hands and attempting to take up farming at will in these bad times, he was not likely to do more than touch the fringe of the bonds over the estate. It was another and a different question whether he might care, when all was done, vol. 1. F"], [78, "66 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS to reinstate himself on the footing which his father had held in the neighbourhood when he came into possession of Blackhall. It might well be that Jem Endicott's pride would defeat itself. The desire and the ability to return to the ranks of his fellows, dwindling in company, might be alike gone before the opportunity presented itself. He showed no inclination of the kind at present where he dwelt, with a couple of farm servants to wait upon him and do all he re quired, while he led the life of a hermit. Certainly, with the object he had in view he could not afford to accept even the few in vitations given him by families in the station of life he was born to, settled in the thinly peopled moorland district round Oxcleeve. If he had possessed money to spend on dress coats and dress boots, his pride would not have suffered him to go among his social equals till he was nearer their level in ma terial prosperity. Jem Endicott's motives were not particu-"], [79, "REAPING THE WHIRLWIND 67 larly exalted, and his method of carrying them out was not very wise ; but at least they were respectable. Still more sympathy was felt for him, in spite of his surly rejection of all sympathy, when the farther obstacle to his success \u2014 of his having his two younger sisters come to live with him \u2014 was put in his uphill path. It was strongly suspected, though Jem did not say so, that they were not at Blackhall by his invitation, but were thrown back on his care by the relatives who had looked after them hitherto. Jem did not repudiate his sisters' claims, however troublesome they might be. For it was impossible that the bachelor establish ment which had served for the brother could suffice for the sisters \u2014 girls of twenty-one and twenty. He might cut down the estimate of what young ladies required to the lowest figure \u2014 and Jem in his impecuniosity was not only known to be prudent : he was believed to be parsimonious \u2014 but he must put fur niture into one or two of the empty rooms, F 2"], [80, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 68 and secure further service than that of Will Beaver, w7ith Will's wife, Sally, just to look in of a morning and an evening, for the purpose of making a bed and cooking a meal. When the sacrifice was made it was not probable that there would be great harmony between the members of an incongruous household. Jem wras heavy, to begin with, and depressed by playing a losing game. The two girls were considerably his juniors. They had been brought up away from home and apart from him. It was not unlikely that they would be foolish and intractable in disposition, and have nothing in common with their brother save the relationship, which was not of his making. It was almost a matter of certainty that the neighbours, who had not been particularly warm to Jem, while he had offended them by churlishly declining their cautious advances, would, as a rule, be cooler still to the youno women of the family. According to social laws, the sins of Celia and Lucy Endicott's"], [81, "REAPING THE WHIRL WLND 69 mother and sister would be visited specially on the pair who had suffered most from them. What had been dimly foreshadowed of the new household at Blackhall was confirmed by experience. The master, without the means or the wish to do more, contented himself with the scantiest changes which common propriety required for the family incum brances thrown upon his hands. The sisters, or rather the ruling spirit of the two, valued his grudging concessions at rather less than they were worth, and was dissatisfied and embittered. The few matrons and spinsters who ought to have taken the new-comers under their wing hung back, with hardly an exception, from doing more than barely acknowledging them, and felt amply justified in their tardi ness and rewarded for their discretion when the daughters of Hugh Endicott and his wife, the sisters of Joanna Endicott, betrayed traces of the stock they came of. They were ac cused of displaying thoughtlessness and levity."], [82, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 70 Instead of being particularly careful how they behaved, they were heedlessly careless with regard to what they said and did, in reference to the construction sure to be put on their sayings and doings. The girls had not a great field for mischief ; but they made the most of the field, and were either stupidly oblivious or incredibly audacious. The circle that sat upon their youthful misdemeanours was a widely different circle from the old rough riding, free-and-easy society of other days. Remote Devonshire, in its wild moors and in accessible cleeves and coombes, had become as civilised as other places ; such sins and crimes as had been well-nigh rampant in former generations had virtually disappeared. The neighbourhood of Oxcleeve in its men and women might still be a little rustic ; but it was decorous in proportion to its condem nation of the scandals of the past. Public opinion, in branding a couple of ignorant rash girls, did not fail to censure their brother who left them to themselves and"], [83, "REAPING THE WHIRLWIND 71 showed no concern for what was to become of them. The whole family were in process of being ostracised together \u2014 Jem, who could not be said to have emerged from his shell ; and his sisters, who shut him in afresh. AU that was left of the Endicotts were sinking down into disrepute and indigence \u2014 a better term than pecuniary difficulties for their desperate circumstances. The sentence might be summary and severe, but, considering everything that had gone before it, the result was neither wonder ful nor altogether inexcusable. It is neces sary to draw a line somewhere. There did not happen at this time to be a woman of the Endicotts' original rank in the neighbourhood, sufficiently influential, independent, daring, or pitiful, and having the powerful motive of an old alliance with the family, to induce her to cross the line to their rescue. There were not wanting some women kindly, and not un friendly, to the girls ; but there was not one who united all the necessary qualifications to"], [84, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 72 be of service. It was of little consequence that there were men hke George Fielding, who had succeeded his father as representa tive of the old firm of lawyers in Ashford, that still stuck to Jem Endicott's waning fortunes, as far as Jem would let them, and in a moderate way continued to frequent Blackhall. The very idea of a household, in which there were ladies young and unmarried, whose few visitors were mostly men \u2014 what ever the standing and character of the men \u2014 was enough to lend a suspected tone to it, and to remove it from the list of ordinary un blemished households."], [85, "73 CHAPTER IV. A TENANT FOE THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE. The vUlage of Oxcleeve, close to Blackball on the border of the great moor, was ancient and straggling. Its inhabitants had married and intermarried in their isolation until many of them were toppling on the verge between oddity and madness. The whole population was perilously near extinction by sickhness and decay, breaking out on all hands in what ought to have been the youth and prime of hfe. The present generation offered a painful contrast to the rude nature in its freshness and power around them, and to the still vigorous grandfathers and grandmothers of a former generation \u2014 hale old men and women in their eighties and nineties. The most con spicuous feature of the place was the way in"], [86, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 74 which the roughly built, whitewashed, olive thatched houses stood at right angles and turned their backs upon each other, even retreating up little lanes in order to secure greater privacy in individual cases. Among the results of such eccentricity was the absence of more than a hundred yards of regular village street at any given spot, with the prevalence of bits of green of all shapes and sizes, tenanted by ponies, donkeys, and the geese, in which Oxcleeve, in the absence of any other small staple production, might be said to do a roaring trade. Balancing the greens were shaggy gardens, open draw-wells, and the sudden intrusion anywhere and every where of stables and cowhouses of cottage o dimensions and on cottage principles, with their attendant manure heaps. There was not a single shop. Tea, groceries, and tobacco, with ale and spirits, had to be got from the next village, distant half a mile. Butchers' meat, except what some farmer occasionally killed in an amateur"], [87, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 75 way, and, after he had served himself and his family, dispensed at the current price to his neighbours, was brought from the town of Ashford, six miles off. The only food that one could absolutely depend upon getting at Oxcleeve consisted of bread, dairy produce, and an unlimited supply of ducks and geese. For some reason fowls did not take kindly to the soil. Of course there was game in the season, which brought relays of sportsmen to the country houses round to keep it down. There was also a rough-and-ready little inn \u2014 half inn, half primitive farmhouse \u2014 called the ' Furze-bush,' in which country people held their feasts, that was at least capable of supplementing the other resources at a pinch. There was no danger of starving at Oxcleeve, though there might be an obligation on those who had not much connection with the outer world to live on plain fare served up with monotonous reiteration \u2014 the joint which one of the farmers, who acted as general carriers, brought from Ashford on the weekly market"], [88, "76 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS day, hot and cold, a pair of ducks swimming in their sea of gravy, the mutilated carcasses of the same, rabbit pie, a dish of trout, and perpetual junket. But much homelier fare was the prevaihng diet at Oxcleeve. There were not more than three or four houses in the village itself which ranked above the tumble-down cottages, unless it were the house of God \u2014 a little old grey church that looked coeval with the moor. But the church was not in the middle of the worshippers who said their prayers in it every Sunday. It stood on a knoll on the outskirts of the village ; had been judiciously restored, and was kept in perfect order by the instru mentality of the severely earnest young vicar, the Rev. Miles North. His vicarage was out of the village also. It was not better than a superior farmhouse, standing in the middle of its offices and grounds among the trees in the hollow of the ' Cleeve,' which, though nominally associated with Oxcleeve, was in reality a little bit off, and was looked down"], [89, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 77 upon literally both by the viUage and Blackhall. Neither were the new school and school-house quite near. The funds for their erection were raised by the vicar, and he had them built under the shadow of the church. Not even a resident country surgeon or postmaster demanded better accommodation than that needed by the peasant dwellers in the cottages, of which the occupants were for the most part the proprietors likewise. The last doctor had been succeeded by a man who preferred the next village as a place of resi dence, and the natives received so few letters that they never dreamt of having a post office all to themselves. The Oxcleeve letters arrived in the regular way as far as Ashford, and were thence dribbled out to their owners by chance hands. Whoever was not content with this simple if precarious system might send a private messenger to Ashford, and, if he also happened to be liberal-minded and public-spirited, might call at once for the letters belonging to the whole village, and"], [90, "78 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS distribute them at his discretion and leisure. Probably the arrangement which argued the minimum of interest in what took place beyond the narrow bounds of Oxcleeve, and the maximum of easy-going confidence in the obliging temper and general integrity of one's feUows, was unique in this nineteenth century England, where any village cobbler or old dame selling dried fish and gingerbread will act as postmaster or postmistress in default of a better. The exceptional houses included three of mark. There was the two-storied inn bearing the sign of the ' Furze-bush,' in egg-yeUow and apple-green. There was a well-built stone house, within a shrubbery protected by iron railings and a gate, situated in the central point of the village, where there was a green, still owning a pound for stray animals, and show ing the stump of a goodly ash tree, beneath which had stood within the memory of man the vUlage stocks. This perfectly modern and habitable house had been built and lived in"], [91, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 79 by the late doctor, and was still tenanted by his widow. Nearly opposite the house, with the green between them, was a very old house, wide and squat, with bulging-out walls, an equally bulging thatch roof, and heterogeneous offices. It was said to be the oldest house in the village \u2014 in fact, the nucleus round which the other houses had sprung up. It was fondly believed, by those who had time and learning for any belief on the subject, to have existed before the time of the Armada. If so, the predecessors of Drake and Hawkins must have been satisfied with modest and homely accommodation. The house was known as the ' Court.' It was surrounded by a low wall, and entered from the green by a wicket gate, which was flanked and overshadowed by a couple of fine ash trees still flourishing. From the gate a flagged pathway ran in a tolerably steep descent down a sloping garden of not many yards square to the house at the foot, and terminated in a low wide porch furnished with a couple of stone seats."], [92, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 80 The Court had belonged for generations to the Endicotts of Blackhall, and, hke everything else belonging to them, had fallen down in Do ' the world. It had been last occupied by a venerable couple, a yeoman farmer and his wife, scarcely removed in manners and habits from the villagers round them, though he had been distinguished from several other men of the same name in the place as ' Gentleman Granaway.' The old couple were sleeping in the churchyard round the church, and the Court, which was certainly not everybody's bargain, had been standing empty for years. It had not even attracted fresh tenants in the change of fashion which had lately, by the potentiality of the moor, brought a sprinkling of summer visitors to remote and inaccessible Oxcleeve, approached by no railway that came nearer than Ashford. These strangers stowed themselves away in extraordinary holes and corners \u2014 in the low-roofed, small-windowed spare rooms of the better built cottages ; in the ' Furze-bush,' where the intruders had to"], [93, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 81 make way for the more legitimate feasters or ' pleasurers ' whenever these elected to appear on the scene ; in the vicarage, imposing them selves on the vicar, hke his ne'er-do-well of a cousin, who was a parasite in that otherwise well-ordered dwelling ; in disused sections of farmhouses. There had even been word of fitting up barns and camping out on the moor, where sportsmen and artists were concerned. But nobody had proposed to establish himself either at Blackhall or the Court. At Black hall, though the Endicott girls might have been glad of any variety, and Jem might have been fain to turn an honest penny by lodging letting had it not been for shame's sake, strangers were kept at bay by the Squire's surhness and hermit habits, even in the shooting season. At the Court positive squalor as well as forlornness stood in the way. Everything was in crying need of a thorough scraping, painting, whitewashing. For the personal walk and conversation of even Gentleman Granaway \u2014 not to say of vol. 1. G"], [94, "82 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS his slatternly old dame \u2014 had not been con ducive to household sweetness and cleanli ness, or to any even tolerably gently nurtured person taking the place of these predecessors without great transformations. It was, therefore, with some surprise that George Fielding \u2014 who continued ostensibly the agent for the Squire of Blackhall, though there was little left to be agent for, and the office had long been purely honorary \u2014 found among the letters which he was opening in his office in Ashford one morning in the late spring, an apparently bond fide offer for the Court at Oxcleeve, an offer to take it as it stood for a term of years. ' It must be from somebody who knows nothing of the real place,' he reflected, ' though how he came to hear of it in that case it is hard to say : the writer is some scheming fellow who has just taken a look at the outside of the poor old house, and imagining that it is not half so bad as it is, sup poses it can be patched up and let for summer lodgings. What are we all coming to ? But"], [95, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 83 it would take hundreds to make it even decently habitable. Very likely when it came to the point Endicott would be applied to, and Jem has no hundreds, ay, or twenties, or tens to spare. I don't think he would let himself be lugged into a doubtful speculation \u2014 still, who knows? Impecunious men, hke drown ing men, catch at straws. If he take my advice he will have nothing to do with this would-be tenant.' George Fielding was not impecunious. He and his father before him had thriven so well on a fine old country business, conducted on strictly honourable principles, that they had become long ago wealthier than many of the squires for whom they acted. The Fieldings might have become squires in their turn, especially as they were well-born \u2014 very likely they would have done so if they had been Scotchmen with a craze for territorial possessions. But George, like his father, had a tender heart to the handsome unassuming Jacobean red-brick house, with the offices on G 2"], [96, "84 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS the ground-floor and the big bowery garden behind, the whole set down in the market town of Ashford. Both men had been born in that house, in which the younger still dwelt, the sole representative of the family. Oddly as it may sound to some, George Fielding had also a tender heart to the pro fession which he had practised for nearly a quarter of a century, ever since he came from college. He might have given up his busi ness, or more profitably sold it, and retired w7ith a fair fortune on his father's death ; but he still stuck to the old lines \u2014 not for mere money-grubbing, not even altogether because he had known that his father, for whose memory he had much regard, would have been grieved and disappointed if he could have foreseen his son's retirement from busi ness in the prime of life, with the extinction, or the transfer to new hands under the old name, of the firm of ' Fielding & Son ' in which he had taken so much pride. George had still other reasons. To him the proses-"], [97, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 85 sion of the law in which he had been bred was his field of work in the world, and to withdraw from it without any strong bent in another direction for the mere purpose of being idle, a man about the world with the means of indulging every whim and freak, did not recommend itself to him as a parti cularly manly course. There was another thing \u2014 he was a student of human nature, as another man is a student of the stars above his head or the stones beneath his feet, and he was persuaded, rightly or wrongly, that in his profession there were wide opportunities for such a study, and that by no means always on the seamy side. He warmly repudiated the opinion that lawyers know nothing save evil of their kind, and, in consequence of their knowledge, learn to distrust their fellows, from the least to the greatest, as instinctively as they breathe the air around them. George Fielding was stiU in his prime, and lid not look an hour older than his forty"], [98, "86 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS years. He was shghtly undersized, but able bodied and active, fit for the endless tramps over the moor with or without his gun or his fishing-rod, which were his chief recreations. His face, dark as a gipsy's, was shrewd and kindly rather than handsome. He had spent the greater part of his life in Ashford, and it and the surrounding country were very much the world to him, while he was intimately acquainted with most of the men and women as well as with the fauna and flora of the district. But whoever chose to set him down as a man of small culture and provincial narrowness, because he had stayed largely at home and had the material for endless gossip at his fingers' ends, would have fallen into a great error. He had made up by the minute ness of his investigations, and by the orderly principle on which he had conducted them, for the smallness of the area in which they were made. As well call White of Selborne narrow in his parochial researches. George Fielding was not a great naturalist any more"], [99, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 87 than a great scholar, but he was considerably beyond the average in originality and intelli gence. His natural qualities, together with his measure of scholarship, had not been rubbed out and frittered away by incessant contact with his fellows. A stationary life in the depth of the country may have a mellow ing and ripening as well as a rustic influence. It depends upon the subject acted upon. Certainly such a life is sometimes another version of learned leisure, with a strong infusion of individuality and simple humanity in the learning which is not altogether that of school and college. George Fielding had not married \u2014 not because he had never forgotten his first love, to whom he had been loyal, lost Joanna Endicott ; rather because he had never met in his comparatively limited circle of female acquaintances another girl or woman who had taken his mature fancy or come up to his later ideal. He was in such a benighted con dition in this respect, in spite of the persist-"], [100, "88 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS ent attempts of some of his fair friends to open his eyes, that he had grown quite reconciled to his state of bachelorhood, and contemplated the prospect of growing old among his office papers and strong-boxes, his books and handsome out-of-date furniture, his old-fashioned trees and flowrers, his old clerks, old servants, and old friends in all ranks, with positively cheerful philosophy. He was satisfied that if he had married, it ought to have been done long ago. If he were tempted to the solemn act at this date, after he had refrained all these years, it would occasion a bouleversement, a shaking up and overturning of the whole past and present economy of his hfe, which he could not con template from a respectful distance without dishke and dismay. ' When I look at the writing again I am not sure, that it is not a woman's hand,' thought George Fielding, taking up for a second time the letter concerning the Court, and scanning it closely. ' I am not prepared"], [101, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 89 to swear either way, or to say that I have never seen it before. \" J. Jones \" is no clue. \"J\" may stand for John or for Jane, for Jeremiah or for Julia, and I have known one or two Joneses as well as Browns and Robin sons in the course of my life. Now, who the dickens is that, before I have well had my breakfast, and this not market day ? ' The last hasty question was in recognition of a peal from the office bell, an assured peal, announcing the arrival of a client. The next moment the chent was shown in, and Mr. Fielding had to vacate his comfortable chair and hand it to the new-comer. His usual clients were men, and homely men to boot, for whom the ordinary chairs were perfectly suitable. But this client was a lady ; more than that, she was a lady of his acquaintance with regard to whom he was aware that she set special store on small social forms and ceremonies. He had so lively a perception of this that he felt himself called upon, after the necessary greeting, not only to vacate his"], [102, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 90 chair, but to subside on an office stool. He made the sacrifice, but it was of such a character that he was conscious of a disposi tion to swing to and fro and fidget in an undignified manner. The lady was Mrs. Reynolds, the widow of the late Dr. Reynolds of Oxcleeve, who still occupied his house in the village. She was a large woman, imposing in size alone. George Fielding was not only acquainted with her, he knew all about her. She had pos sessed pretensions both as a beauty and as the daughter of a small Church dignitary. Neither of these was she inclined to relinquish, though she had reached the shady side of sixty, and in one of the earlier chapters in her history she had condescended to marry a village doctor. The last step had only been compulsory in the sense that she was getting passee when she took it, and with all her vanity she had the foresight to fear that she might not have the acceptance or rejection of many more offers in her power. The conse-"], [103, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 91 quences of this step, including expatriation to Oxcleeve, had been so trying that, after a short shivering experience of the last village on the edge of the moor \u2014 a bracing experi ence which she had not relished much more than poor Mrs. Hugh Endicott had liked it \u2014 Mrs. Reynolds did her best to induce her hus band to sell his practice to wdiomsoever would buy it, and remove to a more civilised locahty. Finding that her influence just stopped short of this movement, she had possessed sufficient sense to enable her, after making sundry wry faces, to submit to the inevitable, and even to get the best out of it that she could. She had been still further reconciled to the situa tion when a sister, who had taken pity on Mrs. Reynolds's loneliness and paid her a long visit, had been as it were smitten by the same fatal necessity of marrying and settling in the undesirable neighbourhood. The gain had not been without its drawback, especially to begin with, for this sister had married much better in a worldly point of view than Mrs."], [104, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 92 Reynolds had married. She had become the wife of Gregory Barnes of Barnes Clyffe, a squire unexceptionable in all respects, except that he was, like many Devonshire squires of his day, not too polished in his manners or brilliant in his parts, and that he absolutely declined to attend church. But this diver gence from the orthodox rule did not, con sidering the type of Devonshire parson Mr. Barnes had been accustomed to, necessarily argue hostility to primitive Christianity on his part. In course of years the advantages of the connection with Barnes Clyffe greatly out weighed any mortification which had been inflicted on Mrs. Reynolds by her younger sister's becoming the wife of one of the leading squires in the district, while she her self was no more than the doctor's spouse, latterly his widow. In fact, the connection with Barnes Clyffe was one of the main in ducements which caused the lady not only to let her husband alone in his old quarters, but"], [105, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 93 so far to change her estimate of Oxcleeve as a residence that she stayed on there in her widowhood. She positively adopted the little moorland village, and elected to preside over it in the character of its lady patroness, at least till the vicar married. Mrs. Reynolds still simpered from between her grey ringlets at past sixty, as she had simpered from between her flaxen curls when she was sixteen. She continued to assert her rank, and even to take precedence of other ladies in spite of their indignant protests as she had been wont to do in a cathedral close, though even there her father had only been one of the lesser luminaries. She paid no attention to the decree by which a wife, except in accordance with the arti ficial provisions of a herald's office, leaves behind her the paternal home and all it implies, and takes the style and condition of her husband. When it has been hinted that Mrs. Reynolds had not a large mind in proportion"], [106, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 94 to her extensive bodily dimensions, it is not intended to insinuate that she was a fool ; at least she was a fool only on one side \u2014 the simpering side, in connection with which she had a girlish giggle, an inclination to bridle in a ridiculously juvenile way, a habit of saying silly things in reference to her un protected condition as a widow and her surviving attractions as a fine woman, with their danger to over-susceptible man, and the scandal which might arise in conse quence. On her other side Mrs. Reynolds was a wide-awake woman, with a sharp eye to her own interest. She was a clever and careful manager of a not very extensive income. Though she kept up an establishment of two maids and a boy in buttons, which looked well in the eyes of a simple-minded Devon shire world, and was fairly comfortable in its working ; though she dressed handsomely, nay, sumptuously, in the judgment of the initiated, according to her station and years,"], [107, "A TENANT FOR THE COURT AT OXCLEEVE 95 she never exceeded her means or incurred debts to the amount of a farthing. For the last achievement George Fielding was inclined to respect her, but the feeling did not go the length of his being disposed to welcome a visit from her at any place or time, least of all in his office during business hours. The vicinity of the great moor was not with out its share of the influence of other wilds in rendering the men and women who hovered on its brink more gregarious ; still, Ashford was not exactly the moor, and the forenoon was not the season for such hospitahty."], [108, "96 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS CHAPTER V. PROS AND CONS. Mrs. Reynolds was ready to speak for herself, as, to do her justice, she always was. ' I hope you will excuse this intrusion, Mr. Fielding,' she said, with one of her idiotic giggles : ' if I had not thought myself justified in coming to you, then you may be sure I should not have been guilty of a step which is, perhaps \u2014 well, a little out of the way from a woman in my position to a man in yours.' She spoke the words mincingly, and glanced round deprecatingly, as if she bespoke the forbearance of the lawyer and his clerks in the outer office. ' Not at all, Mrs. Reynolds,' said George, drumming lightly on the desk at his elbow as"], [109, "PROS AND CONS. 97 a vent for his impatience : ' I have often visits from ladies.' ' Yes, no doubt,' said the lady a little re luctantly, evidently not approving of the general classification. ' You are a highly fa voured man,' with another simper. ' But I dare say these ladies come with or for their husbands. It is different when one has the misfortune to be a widow, and when a gen tleman is a bachelor like yourself.' (Here there was a peculiarly exasperating giggle.) ' We are friends, Mr. Fielding, so we may speak the truth on this delicate point, as on others of less difficulty, without any fear of being misunderstood.' ' Certainly,' answered George promptly, while he asked himself blankly, ' How old does she take me for ? ' He took care not to look at her \u2014 for he knew she was capable of accusing him of ogling her, though he was young enough to have been her son \u2014 while he made the jesting amendment, ' But you must not think that I have no widows among VOL.

' Besides, there are widows and widows.' He bowed as he thought, ' Is that what she has come over to Ashford to tell me? I wonder at what age she thinks a woman ought to be left a widow ? Poor old Reynolds was seventy, though I suppose his age does not matter, and she is sixty if she is a day. What a curiously babyish look there is about her round eyes and the corners of her mouth ! She combines it with an air of portly matron liness and sage experience which would in itself be overwhelming. I do not wish to be rude, but I do wish she would go about her business ; I have her word that she is not here as a client, and she ought not to be in want of a friend's advice and help with a good sort like Greg Barnes for her brother-in law.

But she must let alone that rubbish about widows and single men and the world's opinion. The poor old slandered world ! Hamlet called it mad in his time, but it was never so stark staring mad as this would come to.' George Fielding had to hear a httle more about widows and single men before the in terview was ended. Mrs. Reynolds had been occupied in taking a survey of the room, which was simply a well-used office with marks of con- siderable standing and substantiality about it, and in marshalling her ideas while the gentle- man was pursuing his reflections. Like most large people she was deliberate in her actions, both bodily and mental ; she now returned to the charge.

But her tall figure was good though spare, and she was not old \u2014 not above forty, so far as he could judge.

The climate seemed also to have bleached the band of hair seen under her cap. It was much nearer silver than iron-grey. The pale face surmounted by the silvered hair and the white cap, together with the slightly wavering gait of the figure, would have given something of a ghostly, shadowy character to the lady's aspect ; but these other attributes were contradicted by an expression of quiet power and determination in every feature of the face, especially in the eyes, whose direct appeal somehow thrilled the man they looked at, though he could not remember having seen anybody like Lady"], [135, "GEORGE FIELDING HAS AN INTERVIEW 123 Jones before. She was not the style of woman whom he could imagine swearing an eternal friendship with Mrs. Reynolds, yet she seemed not displeased by the terms of the introduction, for she not only bowed to him, after a moment's hesitation she shook hands as if to ratify it. Then she sat down with an invitation to the others to be seated, and said, with a sigh of relief as if at a difficulty surmounted, and speaking more cheerfully than he had expected she would at the first glance, ' Then that is arranged so far. I may take it for granted there will not be any obstacle to my renting the Court? ' ' I do not see one,' said George, ' unless you should yourself draw back when you know better what you are doing. But you must understand I am only acting for Mr. Endicott, of Blackhall, who knows nothing yet, so far as I am aware, of your offer for his house. The decision must rest with him.'

' But so far as the matter rests with me you will find there will be no drawing back.'

George Fielding recognised still greater evidence of this when he went into parti culars about the amount of accommodation at the Court, together with its dilapidation, and tried to make out without direct inquiry when and to what extent Lady Jones had made acquaintance with Oxcleeve. She at once admitted the acquaintance. ' Oh yes ! I have been in the village, I have seen the Court.' But, beyond the slight amendment, ' It was not of late years,' he could get nothing further out of her.

She did not look shy or timid, but she was not to be induced to furnish him with information about herself in much more than monosyllables.

Possibly she was one of those naturally close, secretive women who are disposed to make mysteries of trifles ; but this conclusion did not agree with the general impression she produced upon her neighbours, as not a small-minded person, or with the perfect simplicity and candour with which she stated, in a few words, what she could do without and what she absolutely wanted in her future dwelling.

' It is sometimes such a mistake, and cripples one so not to begin with the proper thing at once. Our principal roads are not too bad for a carriage with good springs.

The notion of anybody so large, well-to do looking, and well dressed as Mrs. Reynolds pining away was incongruous ; but Lady Jones kept her countenance, while she gave another turn to the conversation. 'Besides,' she said, ' a carriage would be quite out of keeping with my smaU establishment.

Without doubt, Lady Jones was not going to keep a carriage for Mrs. Reynolds's benefit, which was to belong as much to Mrs. Rey nolds as to Lady Jones herself.

' Will you get them done for me?' ' Certainly,' said George again, ' if you wish it, and if you will give me your directions.'

' It is news to find that you must have given her up with the rest of the world ; very justi fiable, I must say, when she ran away with her disgraced mother, and that other person \u2014 there is no need to say more,' ended Mrs. Reynolds, suddenly becoming scrupulous and mealy-mouthed. ' I have never believed that she went with that other person, as you are pleased to indi cate him,' said George Fielding indignantly, ' or with anybody save her miserable mother. I have never changed my opinion of the innocence of the daughter. But she was a high-spirited girl, and she was entirely on her mother's side.

She got up and came to the table to recall everybody to the business in hand, and examine the paper George Fielding had laid down, on which he had been jotting rapidly, in the middle of the conversation, rough notes of the repairs which would be required. When she began to move she stumbled slightly, and he started forward instinctively to help her. Her first impulse wras clearly to waive him off; but she thought better of it, and touched his arm slightly for a second to steady herself, before looking at him with a world more gratitude in her glance than his trifling service called for, bending her head to thank him, and taking the chair that he offered her.

' When do you think the Court can be ready for me ? ' she asked him presently, hurrying him in the preliminary steps. Then, as a reason for pressing the point, she ex plained something of her situation to him, with that element of simple frankness in the middle of her reticence which had in it to him a strain not only of forlorn humour, but of pathos, more striking still in a mature woman than it would have been in a girl.

Lady Jones was not to get away without suffering a httle further detention from her proper business through the supposed neces sity for discussing the affairs of the Endicotts of Blackhall, one of whom, as the owner of the Court, was to be her future landlord. It was George Fielding who began it this time. He raised the question whether Mr. Endicott"], [151, "GEORGE FIELDING HAS AN INTERVIEW 139 had not better call on his future tenant and settle matters personally with her ; but the suggestion was dismissed on the information being given that Lady Jones was not to make any stay at the ' Three Foxes ' in Ashford \u2014 not even till she could have Mr. Endicott's answer to her offer ; she was to return by the first train to London.

' I have said all I could to get my friend to come to me and pay me as long a visit as she can spare me. It would be quite a charity to me, and she could see what was going on at her future house and tell exactly what she wished at every stage of the repairs and decorations.

' I do not wish to come down again till I can go to my own house.' ' The loss is mine,' said Mrs. Reynolds, with magnanimous graciousness. ' But as for Mr. Jem Endicott, I suppose he is rather glad to get off from his part in the programme. He is becoming a perfect boor between being so badly off and such a miser.

He does not hide it himself ; but if it had rested with him he never would have been reduced to such straits ; and if it rests with him still, and he has fair play, he may free himself in time. With regard to his sisters, I say he is doing the best he can for them, as well as for himself, instead of starving them. Good heavens ! it is too preposterous.

Mrs. Reynolds was one of those righteous elderly women who make the fact of their never having strayed by a hair's breadth from the path \u2014 not to say of virtue, but of decorum \u2014 a triumphant warrant for the severity of their censure on the follies of younger women.

I dare say Endicott does not heed or does not believe what people say, if a syllable of it ever reaches his ears. I know he is inclined to set ordinary rules at defiance where he himself is concerned. As for these poor girls, they are young and thoughtless, and left to themselves.' ' But I don't understand who or what you are speaking about,' broke in Lady Jones, with a touch of imperiousness in the tones which had been hitherto perfectly unassuming in their greatest self-reliance and decision.

' Are you aware that there is no authority for the latter part of your statement ? ' said George Fielding in a low tone, with a stern ness which was a great contrast to the ordi nary half-kindly, half-lazy forbearance of his manner. Mrs. Reynolds either did not hear or paid no attention to him.

I must say I never saw a man look more cut up and annoyed.' ' Excuse me, but I think we have had enough of this, Mrs. Reynolds,' said George Fielding almost rudely, for his hard-taxed patience was on the verge of giving way. ' I'm afraid Lady Jones is sick of our local gossip and petty scandal. If we don't take care we'll drive her away before she has settled down among us.' This threat, for which there appeared some grounds in Lady Jones's wearied, discom posed looks, had its effect.

The garden was not altered by so much as the repair of the broken iron nose of the sun dial or the pruning of the upper story of the holly. The lower variegated section in its antiquity and slower growth still kept its prosaic stack shape, while the intruding, wild dark-green shoot above hung over like a pent house, and at the same time towered aloft in a profusion of strong branches which had already reached a sufficiently respectable and independ ent age for the leaves to begin to propose a truce by dropping their prickles, and the stalks to be every winter more and more generous and bountiful in consenting to be crusted and double-crusted with clusters of scarlet berries. But within doors there was not so much"], [165, "HEAD OF THE FAMILY AT BLACKHALL 153 the old dilapidation as positive desolation. The mildewed, weather-stained hall and the passages, smelling of damp and cobwebs, were devoid of furniture, just as they had been left a good many years before when Hugh Endicott was sold up. There were not half a dozen rooms furnished, and that in the barest man ner, in the whole house. These included the kitchen and an adjoining room in which the elderly farm man and his elderly wife, the entire staff of house-servants, slept, a couple of bedrooms, and a nondescript sitting-room. Had it not been for the last the whole place, together with the habits of its inmates, might have been held to have fallen back into the primitive yeoman character of the original dwelling, and the dwellers within its bounds. There was still a sprinkling of these strong, solid, rough, yeoman homesteads, with their single house-place and their limited number of sleeping-rooms standing in the middle of their offices, the manure heap, and the duck pond below the windows, the goose-green\u2014 the"], [166, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 154 single distant approach to a place of recrea tion \u2014 within reach, on the edge of the moor. But the sitting-room at Blackhall, no less than the three-cornered lawn with the sundial and holly-stack, removed it from this class. There were a few traces of higher culture present, in the absence of any distinctive sign which could indicate either dining-room or drawing-room. Jem Endicott still read the newspapers and a book occasionally. There was a newspaper and a volume on his common deal desk. The drugget on the floor was of the coarsest description, the rug was of ordinary sheepskin. But somebody had worked various semi- artistic, semi-foolish mats for the coal-scuttle to stand on, to lie in the window recesses, to keep the draught from the door. There were half-pretty, half idiotic cushions of a similar description on the strong old pine-wood chairs, acquired at some sale of aboriginal furniture. Oddly enough, there was a piano, a jingling rattlepan, for its history was that it had"], [167, "HEAD OF THE FAMILY AT BLACKHALL 155 belonged to Mrs. Hugh Endicott. It had been claimed for her daughters on the breaking up of the establishment, when the younger children were taken away by their relatives ; and little worth as the musical instrument was, it had been punctiliously sent back to Black- hall with Celia and Lucy when they were finally thrown on their brother's hands. Small as might be the harmony drawn from that rosewood box, there was an air of faded gentihty about its yellowing ivory keys and painted soundboard. In the stand beside the piano was an array of music-books in frayed morocco binding. There were bookshelves in another recess not so well furnished, filled with odd volumes that looked as if they had strayed there, for some of them belonged to expensive editions bound in Russian leather heavy with gilding. Two little satin-lined work-baskets with lace frills and riband bows \u2014 cheap enough affairs, no doubt, but having a dainty, if not a frivolous air \u2014 stood on the oak table. There was a wooden flower-"], [168, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 156 stand, home-made and home-painted\u2014 in fact, knocked together by Beaver, the farm servant, ' to pleasure one of the tew young misses,' but quite capable of holding half a dozen ferns, a lotus lily with its stately green leaves and white trumpet of a flower, a few scarlet geraniums by way of broad contrast, and a minor row of dwarf cacti. These distorted, grotesque-looking examples of the vegetable world, with their slow growth, prickly stolidity, indifference to watering and other delicate attentions, choice memories of sandy wildernesses, and slightly mocking and sardonic expression, have a singular fascination for a certain order of mind. The flowers and ferns which needed to be tended, and repaid loving care by grateful blossoms and fronds, belonged to Lucy Endicott.

Perhaps, after all, Blackhall was not barer than many an Itahan palace of historic name and fame. Neither were its domestic arrange- ments simpler or more frugal. But the pity of it was that Italian palaces and their economy are not as a rule familiar to the English middle and lower classes.

Though there were a few homely yeomen squires surviving in Devonshire, for any man born in Jem Endicott's position to do no more for the reception and entertainment of two young girls, his sisters, fresh from school, than to make them free of such an establishment, argued one of two things.

He had not the means to give more"], [171, "HEAD OF THE FAMILY AT BLACKHALL 159 than the most rough-and-ready mending and re-lining to the house, which had been his father's and was now his own, unless his cre ditors took it from him, and he did not attempt more than he could not possibly avoid, because under present circumstances he did not care to return to the class and circle from which he had in a great measure dropped. He had no desire for that influx of half-pitying, half scornful, wholly critical company of old friends and neighbours, of which Mrs. Reynolds had been one of the few avant-coureurs. She had imphed that the main body would have fol lowed her if Jem Endicott had shown any right feeling for himself and proper considera tion for his female relations in the light of their sex, gentle breeding, and future pro spects, which hung in the balance. Jem was simply struggling to pay the debts his father had left to him together with a blighted name, because the younger man was ruggedly honest, no doubt, but also to defy and get the better of those who distrusted him. Either he was"], [172, "160 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS destitute of the ambition, for which he had been given a certain amount of credit, to redeem his fortunes in order to return to the ranks of the moorland squirearchy, more than partially closed to him, or, under the prolonged difficulty of the heavy task he had undertaken, the ambition was becoming rapidly stamped out of him. In some respects Jem, more than any other of his family, unless his sister Joanna, had been the scapegoat of the sins and sorrows of his predecessors. He had been old enough, even when he was a boy at school, to under stand something of the reproach which clung to his name, and to have it branded into him. He had come back to face the lingering ob loquy of his mother's and sister's disgrace, his father's shame and ruin, in the place where it had all happened. Jem had endured the ordeal, living on and fighting his battle where the wrong had been done, until he had no wish, or only a faint and fugitive one, to win back what had"], [173, "HEAD OF THE FAMILY AT BLACKHALL 161 been lost to him in public consideration and regard. It was well known that, even after his sisters had joined him, he not only re jected with scant courtesy all faltering invita tions for him to re-enter the bosoms of the families of his fellow-squires, he took what rest and refreshment he cared for in the sanded parlour of the ' Furze Bush,' the Ox cleeve inn, among the moormen and peasant proprietors of the district. Yet he was never exactly accused of being a lover of low company, for though he was a regular fre quenter of the place, it was not as the equal of the other frequenters. He was no sot, or buffoon of a Tony Lumpkin. Indeed, he kept aloof from the inn circle as from other circles. He was temperate enough to have worn the Blue Ribbon. He was proud in his way, and sat apart in the chair which was reserved for his use, nobody interfering with him or even addressing him unless he gave them permission by speaking first.

Her father was so gratified by the compliment that, though he could ill spare his clever, good little girl, his only child, from the double post of mistress and maid which her mother had left vacant, he was fain to find a substitute for Kitty in an elderly female cousin. He did not cast scorn on his inn, which, in those respectable days, was as little noisy and rough and as free from scandal as an old-fashioned village inn \u2014 half inn, half alehouse \u2014 could well be.

In the mornings at Blackhall Jem Endicott had an early breakfast in company with his sister Lucy. Celia did not often trouble her self to join them. She came down when she was ready, and frequently ate her breakfast in solitude. Jem had a habit, which might have been picked up from examples supplied for his study at the ' Furze Bush,' of satisfying his hunger on hunches of bread eaten with his coffee, while for anything farther he was unswervingly faithful to Sally Beaver's scrambled eggs and rashers of bacon.

It was, therefore, of less consequence that the elder of the two sisters was often not present at what might be called the family breakfast table. When Jem rose from it, he generaUy repaired to his fields or to the moor to inspect his cattle and sheep. The last-mentioned duty sometimes took him long distances, so that he was little within doors. Whoever had followed him would have found a man less in stature than Hugh Endicott, but still a big man with a share of the same strapping comeliness. His rough tweed suit and battered straw hat did not fit in so badly with it ; what really spoilt his looks was his downcast, more or less sullen air. That was something very different from the swaggering joviality and devil-may-care ness which had distinguished wild Hugh Endicott in his earlier years. The two recreations which Jem had"], [178, "166 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS reserved for himself were hunting and fishing. He could hardly have been a Devonshire man and not clung to horses and hounds. As for fishing, it afforded him his sole holidays. After he had exhausted the streams and pools in his neighbourhood, he went off every summer when work among the cattle and sheep was slackest. He walked the wdiole length of his journey and slept in inns like the ' Furze Bush,' or in shepherds' huts, the accommodation of which lent the inns a reflected splendour, and so contrived to afford the expense of his expedition. But Jem was seen to greatest advantage when he was on horseback. Horses were no luxury on the vast moor, where a native breed was said to have flourished in the long past. It still maintained many hundreds of strong serviceable ponies. If they were not Katerfeltos, they were at least capable of considerable cultivation. But a man like Jem Endicott, who took a solitary pride in the horse which he often groomed and fed with"], [179, "HEAD OF THE FAMILY AT BLACKHALL 167 his own hands, was not content with a moor pony. He indulged in one luxury, and that was his sorrel, 'Dragon.' He was a bold, keen rider, and would sooner clear the gate at Blackhall, horse and all, than take the trouble of alighting to unfasten it. He did not deny himself any chance of following the hounds as he denied himself so much else, though he was glum and unsocial in his hunting as in every other occupation. He made no friendly acquaintances at the meet, and rode home unaccompanied by any cheery comrade in the grey foggy afternoons. But w-hen he came galloping back past the Oxcleeve church and school, across the goose-greens, and down what there was of a village street, scattering the sheep-dogs and the geese before him, he looked to unsophisticated eyes rather a gallant figure. It was as in the old ballad, when the bonnie Earl o' Moray ' cam' sound ing through the toun.' The spell was not broken when Jem pulled up at the door of the ' Furze Bush ' in order to give, in a gruff"], [180, "168 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS word or two, the coveted information of where the fox had been killed, how the scent was holding, and at what place the meet was to be next day. There was a breath of the knight of romance about him then, instead of the broken-down air of the loutish squire of Blackhall."], [181, "169 CHAPTER VIII. CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT. Not only had Lucy and Jem breakfasted together on a day in question, Celia had finished her breakfast also. Sally Beaver had cleared the table, and the sisters were at liberty to follow their own pursuits. Lucy was looking after^ her flowers, snipping off the dead leaves, stirring up the earth, and watering the pots from the little can kept below the stand. After this duty was done she would sit down opposite her little work basket, prepared to occupy herself with its contents, unless Celia called on her to go out or to do something else. For it was Lucy who kept up the sedulously subdued sketchy fancy-work she had learned at school, and"], [182, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 170 diligently embroidered in dull colours and skeleton patterns innumerable mats and cushions, when she was not hemming those half-curtains for the bedroom windows which required to be perpetually changed and renewed. Their fleeting character might be partly due to Jem's tearing his down about once a day, and to Beaver, according to Sally, ' a-spiling of hissen with his great mucky fingers.' Sally's soul was vexed by the get ting up of these ' rags o' curtains,' and was in no way soothed by the impartiality with which Lucy dealt out a curtain for the special benefit of Sally and Beaver. To watch Lucy in the making of those everlasting curtains, which she regarded as a much more serious obligation than the fancy work, one might have been tempted to conclude that the whole duty of woman lay in a nutshell. It was to provide spotless clear-starched curtains which blurred the view from upper windows, that were only looked down upon with difficulty at many yards'"], [183, "CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT 171 distance from the garret windows of one or two cottages at the end of the village. It was not a very large-minded version of woman's mission, but at least two things could be said for it \u2014 it did not fit in with Mrs. Reynolds's wholesale denunciation of the Endicott girls. And it was a great deal better than any theory which permitted what was Lucy's sister Celia's practice, alternations be tween being furiously busy on her own account and totally idle where the interests of others were concerned. Celia Endicott was doing nothing at this moment. She was sitting, leaning with her elbows on the table, and her hands clasped under her chin, just as at another moment she would be lying back on the hard unyielding chair, which had not been made for such ease, with her white fingers interlaced above her head, or walking up and down with her arms a-kimbo or her hands clasped behind her back. Celia and Lucy both bore traces of their descent as strongly after their different fashions"], [184, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 172 as Jem did after his. These Endicotts were what circumstances had made them, which may be said of most of us ; but theirs had not been happy circumstances, likely to foster every virtue and grace. It might have been thought that the two girls had been kept out of the family misdeeds and misfortunes. Celia and Lucy had been mere children when the tragedy was wrought out. They had been taken away from the neighbourhood, and their guardians had determined, with a not unmerciful purpose, that the little girls should grow up as ignorant as possible of what it perhaps concerned them more than any one else to know, with regard to certain passages in the family history. So far as anybody interested was aw7are, nobody had ever spoken to the pair, except to turn aside their childish questions when the events happened, of what had become of Mrs. Endicott and Joanna, and of the latter end of Hugh Endicott. There was an impression among the relations who had assumed the"], [185, "CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT 173 care of Celia and Lucy that they believed their mother and sister as well as their father had died like ordinary persons, only that the first two had been lost to the family by a double sickness and death. It was alleged that Celia, who possessed a lively imagination, had been heard to give a detailed account of their funeral. If the true state of the case \u2014 either with regard to Mrs. Endicott and Joanna or to Hugh Endicott \u2014 was commu nicated to the head of the school in which the girls were placed, it was under a seal of secrecy which there was no temptation to break. It was more in the schoolmistress's interest that those family histories of her pupils which were not altogether creditable should remain hidden in oblivion, than that they should be picked to pieces by a cen sorious public. Neither was there any great likelihood that in the crude school gossip \u2014 an immature reflection of the gossip of the world\u2014 the girls' feUow-pupils would give out garbled editions of the truth in spurts of"], [186, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 174 malice, within hearing of the victims. Yet the two knew perfectly, though they did not speak of it directly even to each other, the outline of their story \u2014 knew it as well and with as great an effect upon them as if they had lived in the midst of it, or as if it had been inhumanly dinned into their ears after the fashion in which, in the old days, their father had kept savagely reminding their mother of her meditated transgression. The single beneficial result of the silence which had been preserved on the subject, silence which was in itself a blight and a terror, appeared in the wholesome shame which enveloped the past more or less where the surviving members of the family were con cerned. None of them would lightly venture to overleap the nameless barriers and rake up the ashes of dead fires among themselves, in the privacy of such a home as they shared, not to say in public to an audience of strangers. Not even Celia would openly attack the old ugly scandal, though she was"], [187, "CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT 175 quite capable of nibbling at it, and making her own of it, under the rose, with Jem and Lucy \u2014 particularly with Lucy. Ceha had been hardened, and not softened, by the trial in which she had perforce borne a part. She was, in her precociously womanly way, even more of an Ishmaelite than Jem was believed to be, with her hand still more against every woman than his was against every man. Yet she never in a straight forward manner mentioned her mother and elder sister any more than her father to Jem and Lucy. Something kept her back. She was not so sure now that the two whose sensational funeral she had evolved from her childish consciousness were dead, though she certainly hoped they were. She did not in the least know what had become of them, and she would not inquire, any more than Jem or Lucy would ask tidings of those who were dead to them. Ceha indemnified herself for the self-restraint, whenever she chose, in her intercourse with her sister. Frequently,"], [188, "176 THE BLACKHALL GHOSIS when the two were alone together, though rarely before strangers, she made biting allusions to the family history, and drew cutting deductions in a spirit of defiance, either of bitter mockery or of angry rebel lion. But it was also true that even in the glittering metallic gaiety of her lighter moods she used the knowledge which had come to her in such an intangible manner, as a weapon in her armoury, with which she could deal as cruel wounds in sheer sport. Unhappily for Celia Endicott's relations and friends, to inflict mental pain on the persons nearest to her, when the mood was upon her, appeared a necessity of her nature, adding zest to her pleasure and comforting her in vexation. Whether in her strange idiosyn crasy she realised the suffering she caused is a totally different matter. Unquestionably her eyes only sparkled more brightly or blazed more fiercely for the spectacle of her sister Lucy listening to her with a white face, trembling lips, and scared eyes."], [189, "CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT 177 It may be judged, naturaUy enough, that with these uncomfortable characteristics Celia Endicott was an unpopular person, detested and shunned by all with whom she came in contact. It depended on the closeness of the contact, and the nature of the people involved in it. There was a self-sufficing potentiality about her which recommended her to an over-burdened world, especially to people of weaker character than her own. She did not complain, or impose her troubles and injuries on anybody, save, indeed, on her sister Lucy. Though Celia would not go out into the would and work for her maintenance, she could look after and take care of herself in a way which conveyed an impression, perfectly correct, that she was ridding her neighbours of a considerable burden which they must otherwise have borne. She was almost always gay ; and there is so much sorrow in the world that gaiety of any kind is apt to be welcome, especially to unreflecting spirits. When it vol. I. n"], [190, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 178 suited her she had a superficial bonhomie, which was her most obvious quality to an outer circle in whose estimation she stood fairly well \u2014 far before Lucy. By force of circumstances the sisters had few acquaint ances, while Celia at least had no desire for female friends. The circle referred to con sisted chiefly of not over-particular onlookers, many of whom were inclined to condone such errors as were laid to Celia's charge, and to think rather favourably of her. ' Poor, hand some, high-spirited Miss Endicott, nothing sly about her. She had a great deal to live down for which she was not accountable ; she was wasting her youth in a remote moorland village with a lout and screw of a brother and a demure puss of a sister who was not the image of her mother for nothing. Miss Endicott's jests and laughter were quite creditable to her.' ' Well, what is to be the order of the day, Lucy ? ' asked Celia carelessly, over her clasped hands ; ' are we to fall asleep and"], [191, "CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT 179 dream for a hundred years, in order to be awakened by tw7o romantic fools of princes at last ? Or, what would be better still, I dare say, shall we go down hand in hand to the Bar, plunge in, and, as we were never taught to swim like the heroines of American novels, rid Jem of the burden of two such useless ornaments as we are, and have done with this unsatisfactory world at once ? ' ' How can you say such horrible things, Celia ? ' cried Lucy, hastily putting down her watering-can, and pressing back her yellow hair from both sides of her forehead, as much distressed and scandalised as if the hearing of such horrible things was altogether new to her. 'You know it is a sin even to jest of what would be a great crime. You speak as if Jem, our own brother, did not care for us.' ' Good little girl, who has profited by her vicar's last sermon ! And what a pity the parson cannot hear her, for I am afraid her high moral tone would be lost on his cousin N 2"], [192, "180 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS Tony, as it is on unworthy me, I am sorry to say,' said Celia, bent on tormenting Lucy in lieu of bigger game. ' And so Jem cares for us, does he ? I must say that is news to me, though he is our brother. It looks very much hke it, doesn't it ? ' and she glanced contemptuously round the room \u2014 poverty stricken and picturesque. ' Well, what would you have ? ' protested Lucy, showing the same ready disposition to tears which had been conspicuous in her mother. ' You know Jem is very poor, yet he has taken us in, and does not propose to turn us out. He does not ask us to relieve him by going out into the world as governesses or companions. He does not expose us to any other cruel reverse which we were not born and brought up to.' It was clear from Lucy's manner and from her not very logical speech that she was not in the least familiar with the dignities or the charms of the higher education for women. Indeed, the girls had been brought up in an"], [193, "CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT 181 old-fashioned second-rate school, and though even second-rate schools are a good deal better now than they were wont to be, and the Endicotts had been well enough taught in the ordinary branches of a tolerably liberal education, with the usual list of accomplish ments, the idea of pursuing knowledge for knowledge's sake, or of entering upon inde pendent careers, was as foreign to them as it would have been to their grandmother. Lucy could not have compassed such a career though it had been brought before her in its most alluring form. Celia might, but her nimble wits had been turned in a very different direction \u2014 to getting what enjoy ment and amusement she could out of hfe, since it did not appear to her that she was likely to get much else, and to paying back in her own fashion the disdain and neglect with which she was persuaded the world was prepared to treat her and her sister. Celia resembled her father personally,"], [194, "182 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS though she was neither like her brother Jem nor her sister Joanna, both of whom had displayed their father's traits in different styles. Celia looked as if she ought to have been tall, with her broad shoulders and long arms, but somehow she failed in height ; she was rather shorter than Lucy. It .vas as if the blast of adversity which had blighted her fortunes and perverted her nature had also in a degree stunted her physically. Not that there was the slightest lack of health or even of bodily harmony in Celia's lack of height ; on the contrary, there was something not merely vigorous but agreeable to look upon in her square shoulders, together with the erect ness and elasticity of her carriage and gait. Her figure, which the tightly sitting jerseys and plain skirts she generally wore suited admirably, did more than give an impression of power, it suggested a certain robust grace born of power. In spite of her fits of laziness she was, when she liked, as indefatigable and unsurpassable a walker as her sister Joanna"], [195, "CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT 183 had been ; she was good at all games which demanded cool skill and enduring strength. She would have been an excellent tennis player and dancer, only she hardly ever got the opportunity. Her face was handsome, like all the Endicott faces; but in place of the gloom which had darkened some of them, hers was set in lines of hard aggressive brightness and lurking malice ; not the mindless mischief of a child, but the sardonic mockery of a woman who knows herself hopelessly in the wrong by no doing of hers, and keenly resents her fate. In her bitterness Ceha Endicott determined to indemnify herself for what she had missed by throwing off all allegiance to society and doing what she pleased. She laughed in the faces of those who groaned and held up their hands at her conduct; in fact, the deeper the groans, the higher the hands were held up, the greater was her disdain ful, distempered enjoyment. For withal there was something erratic in this girl and her doings \u2014 something abnormal \u2014 a mixture"], [196, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 184 of the stealthy, relentless wild cat, and the mowing, mocking monkey. In spite of her vigour of mind and body, there was evidence of a mental as well as a moral twist in her composition. There was no mistake as to what pre decessor Lucy Endicott took after. She was the image of her mother in her younger days \u2014 the slender fairness, the yellow hair, the round blue eyes, the small white teeth, the expression of shallowness, irresolution, and timidity, verging on cravenness \u2014 all were re produced in the daughter. Lucy's very style of dress, aUowing for the changes in fashions, had an affinity to what had been her mother's style, though the younger woman had never been in circumstances to be smart, and neither had she descended to being slovenly. But there was something flowing, fluttering, and girhshly, if forlornly, dainty and gay in Lucy's shabby frocks, and in the trimmings of her j ackets and hats. Her very slippers had been worked in beads by her own ingenuity, and"], [197, "CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT 185 her handkerchief was apt to be a rag of muslin with a coloured border. Lucy had not taken in at a glance, as Celia had done, how unsuit able such toilets were for Blackhall and the great moor, and simply to suit her own con venience, not at all in deference to the opinions of others, modified and altered what needed modification and alteration. But as for Lucy, she never took a walk on the moor without tearing her trimmings, or crossed the brooks without sticking among the stones, and having those absurd boots of hers all but wrenched apart. She would come home with her light sunshade shockingly soiled, her lace veil rent, her silk gloves in holes \u2014 her entire self a depressed, deplorable, and laughable object. However, Lucy Endicott's early experi ence had been altogether different from Mrs. Endicott's. There had been no fostering of her small vanities, no vulgarising of any deli cacy of mind which belonged to her, no fritter ing away of any sweetness and kindness that"], [198, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 186 was native to the girl in false sentiment and silly flirtations. There had not been any undermining of her sense of duty by accus toming her to a low standard of truth and honour, any withdrawing of all responsibility and obligation, any launching of her on an endless round of petty visiting with which she was perpetually distracted, till her not very wise head was fairly turned. On the contrary, the butterfly had been under the wheel ; and the fact of its remain ing uncrushed furnished a faint hope that it was not a mere butterfly after all, but an im mortal creature that might rise to immortal heights under salutary discipline and wise training. There was something innocent and childlike still in poor Lucy's confiding, appeal ing blue eyes, something loyal in her fright ened attempts to propitiate Jem and do trifles for him in return for the shelter he gave her and Celia ; something that had merit in it in the persistent way in which she stitched on, without any encouragement, at those trumpery"], [199, "CELIA AND LUCY ENDICOTT 187 little mats and cushions which she was per suaded made the place look better, and was accomplishing something for the others.

In truth, he did not know what to do with the ' tew boarding-school misses,' as Sally defined them and as Jem regarded them \u2014 a pair of useless fine ladies thrown on his hands. He could not in his manliness, and in what strain of a gentleman was left in him, bid them take themselves off and maintain themselves in some fashon, but he heartily wished they would do so.

Over Lucy, Celia had aU the overwhelm ing influence of strength over weakness ; of a domineering, unscrupulous temper in relation to another hopelessly yielding, full of whys and wherefores, of ' Can't I do it's ? ' or ' Shall I not do it's ?

Could it ever be that Celia might work on Lucy and rouse her, as a worm may be made to turn, into a frenzy of apprehen-"], [204, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 192 sion where her brother was concerned, of blind hostility towards him? Could it be that the elder sister might torment and tor ture the younger ; hunt, harass, and madden her into enacting the wretched heroine of a French tragedy, in which the fumes of sulphur or the water of the Seine, with the ghastly Morgue in the background, play the prominent part ? Celia returned to the subject of Jem and his delinquencies towards his sisters. ' A nice time of it we two poor girls have, to be sure,' said Celia, 'shut up in a dreary old hole like this, not even made decently comfortable for us ! Hardly a creature, a man creature, I mean \u2014 not that we are particularly troubled with women creatures \u2014 to cross the threshold, unless a pottering naturalist and grinnino philosopher, who is already a bachelor in his third lustre, particular about his flannel vest, and nervous about wet feet, like Fielding.'

Oh ! but he cannot rule his own house accord ing to his canons. His cousin Tony is a fine sample of his parishioners.' ' I wonder Mr. North puts up with his cousin,' exclaimed Lucy, with a slightly heightened colour and a small pout of righ teous indignation. Futile as it might be, it sufficiently cleared her of any active share in the lamentable association of the girls' names with that of a man of Tony North's character. Lucy's tone, to whomsoever heard it, limited her offence, where grave indiscretion was in question, to weak complicity and connivance. ' Mr. Anthony North must be such a trial to a clergyman,' went on Lucy ; ' and it is so in considerate, so ungrateful of him.' vol. 1. 0"], [206, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 194 ' We had better hear both sides before we decide,' said Celia, with lazy impartiality.

He is a great deal better than that \u2014 an amusing, graceless, black sheep of a Tony ; an obliging, convenient, fetch-and carry Tony ; an impudent wretch of a Tony ! It is impossible to tell what we owe him,' finished Celia reflectively, with an affectation of conscientious thankfulness. ' I don't believe we owe him anything,' said Lucy hastily. 'It is all the other way. I wish we had never seen his face. I would give a good deal not to meet him so often. I don't like his coming here when Jem is out.

If you would go, it might be pleasant ; we might coax Jem to go with us, and I cannot help thinking he might make friends with old Mr. Barnes.' ' You are a goose, Lucy,' said Celia in cold blood, without the slightest ill-humour. It was a peculiarity of Celia's that she rarely showed signs of temper, even when she was deliberately provoking other people and setting them by the ears for her private entertainment. She prided herself on her command of temper, while it was one of her hardest, most baffling traits, sufficient to have disheartened her good angel. Perhaps she made up for it by the white heat of her wrath when it was excited. ' There are plain men and plain men.

' I declare, Lucy, I believe you would hke nothing better than to act as another female curate to the Reverend Miles,' cried Celia, suddenly turning upon her sister with a taunting gibe, much as a cat would play with a mouse which it could despatch at any moment. Lucy crimsoned and positively quivered as she shook her head, so that a suspicious person might have leaped to the conclusion that there had been something in Celia's random speech which had struck home. Possibly the Reverend Miles had been so enterprising, or so left to himself, as to invite Lucy to join his staff, and Lucy had ruefully declined.

In her threats Celia had dropped Lucy out of the question. She was treating her, to Lucy's face, as the cipher and nonentity which Celia held her sister to be, even when she made use of the younger girl's personality to serve the elder's purposes. It must be admitted that Lucy was behaving very like a nonentity. She was simply looking bewildered and frightened, till Celia, slightly ashamed of herself, not for the treatment of Lucy, but for the comparative earnestness into which she had been betrayed, though it had a scoff and a sneer in it, returned hastily to the main thread of the conversation."], [214, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 202 'I'm not such a poor creature as to be patronised by the Barneses, still less by that detestable doctor's widow, their relation.

' I don't think Tony North ought to have told you what she said, or that you should have listened to him,' said Lucy, nerved by her vehement aversion to the gentleman to stand up once more against her elder sister and mentor. Ceha was nettled. She did not care for Lucy's code of honour, but her own queer code forbade her to act, as she was neverthe less quite well aware that she frequently acted, in a manner that was not in accordance with the standard of a lady.

Don't you enjoy hearing Tony North's highly spiced society talk, and getting glimpses of his immeasurably wider experi ence ? ' 'No, I don't,' said Lucy, very sincerely, but a little deprecatingly. ' I suppose it is because I am not clever enough, since you like it. But it seems to me that he is always saying ill-natured things with a smile or a laugh that makes them pass for pieces of wit. I don't think I care for such wit. I cannot help an impression, though it may be wrong and unjust, that he invents as he goes along.' ' Of course it is shockingly wrong and heinously unjust,' said Celia, with a ringing laugh. 'But if he does invent, what a capital inventor he must be \u2014 off-hand, too !

' I don't in the least know what you mean,' said Lucy, who looked uselessly hot and ineffectually angry, hke a ruffled pigeon, while she took refuge in the ignorance and perplexity which in themselves were perfectly genuine. ' But I am certain you are alto gether wrong about Mr. North \u2014 the clergy man, I mean. He is not weary of his work. He is very much interested in it. Everybody says he is devoted to it. He is very good and kind, though he makes people stand in awe of him. I suppose he cannot help that,' finished Lucy, with a quick sigh. ' I suppose not,' said Celia. ' But does he make innocents stand in awe of him? He does not make me ; but then I am not an innocent.

' said Lucy, writhing. ' But that is not what we were speaking about. It strikes me Oxcleeve is very fortunate, after what I have heard of some of the former vicars, to have Mr. North for a clergyman.' Celia strolled to the window as if she were tired of the subject, but turned round in stantly.

Then glancing at the door with an air of expectation which had something in it of the awe of which she had spoken, and something also of wistful admiration, a wave of delicate pink passed over her fair skin from the tip of her chin to the roots of her yellow hair."], [221, "209 CHAPTER X. A CLERICAL VISITOR. The Rev. Miles North was taU, fair and pale, with closely cropped blonde hair and closely trimmed beard and moustache, the latter naturally tending to invisibility, from the lightness of the hair and the fairness of the skin underneath. In features, as in figure, he would have been a handsome young man, a little under thirty, had it not been for the same want of shade in his face which Queen Elizabeth enjoined in her portraits, and for a certain impassiveness of expression and rigidity of muscle, the effect of which was increased by his straight black coat and white tie, since he was a man rarely out of uniform.

P"], [222, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 210 agreed with the definition which George Fielding gave of the clergyman's character : 'North would really be a fine fellow if he would not be continually putting force on himself, and if he would sometimes sink the parish priest in the man.' But Miles North was bent on doing with all his might whatever his hand found to do in his office ; and as the natural man demanded some indulgence, perhaps all the more ur gently in proportion to the extent to which it was denied lawful ease and enjoyment, there was a necessity that he should put force on himself and wear his clerical armour night and day. In the same manner he had such a high ideal of the parish priest and such an ardent desire to walk up to his ideal, that he was inclined to undervalue the mere man and trample upon him. He had not come to the stage in his history, if he ever reached it, when he would do justice to the man also, and would not be afraid to trust him as God's creature in a broader sense than the priest."], [223, "A CLERICAL VISITOR 211 He did not see that all men in the very man hood which Miles North was tempted to undervalue belonged to a divine priesthood, of which the human priesthood, though it might also be ordained of God, was but a figure. Considering what Miles North was \u2014 a high-minded, unswervingly righteous man, \u2014 it was of less consequence that he not only worked hard himself, but also called on others to work hard, requiring from them the same painful self-denial which he prac tised. He had been fairly acceptable to the rude, half-wild sheep of this moorland pas ture-ground. The fact was, they had been accustomed to be ridden over and ruled des potically. But whatever they had lost, it was not a certain rough loyalty in the middle of their sometimes half-brutal and insolent independence.

Miles North's godliness, his con cern for his Master's honour and his brethren's good, and the subserviency of his own interests and inclinations to what went before them, came like a revelation to the coarse, passionate people, and shone in their eyes as transcendent virtues when compared with what the natives had known of former clergymen \u2014 utterly careless, in different men, belonging to an ill-equipped, debased section of the sons of the Church. To say of any one of them that he was a renowned fox-hunter and a jolly boon com panion was high praise ; and wdien to these unclerical qualities had been added a little common honesty, a more or less reckless open-handedness with sundry precious grains of human kindness and tenderness of heart, the sum-total of priestly worth was reached."], [225, "A CLERICAL VISITOR 213 Miles North never rode to hounds, which was a great mistake. He liked hunting, and might with a clear conscience have permitted it to himself sometimes. Besides, any indi vidual feat he had accomplished or gallant performance he had joined in on the field which Dame Nature had tossed and tumbled to make fit ground for such achievements, might have served to recommend him to those of his parishioners who still stood aloof from him, and been a bond of union between him and such a young man as Jem Endicott. But no doubt the Rev. Miles showed his courage and daring in other ways, else he would have been regarded as a mere milksop, and treated to a small measure of respect in these regions. He would scour the moor in all directions in search of a lost mare and her foal, not to say a lost woman and her child. He would risk missing his way in solitudes that were practically as illimitable as the North American prairies or the Australian bush, and being benighted and in danger"], [226, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 214 of perishing of cold and hunger, before he could recover the clue to his whereabouts and return to the dwellings of men.

But no power of writing sermons, or laying ghosts, or defy ing the devil would serve him in the same stead as a brave heart and a cool head, with the strong limbs of a trained swimmer, when the boat he had appointed to meet him failed him, and he breasted the Bar in flood in order to carry in time the last consolations of reli gion to a poor old woman sobbing out her dying breath in a hovel far from her kind.

He had not spared himself, and it may be said also he had not spared other people, yet he had managed to be generally liked as well as generally respected and feared. Still without question such a pinnacle of attainment had its difficulties and perils. He was a good deal exercised by the demon strative approbation of his work and of him self on the part of such a woman as Mrs. Reynolds, and the very fact of having accom plished so much as he had done piqued him with the mortifying consciousness that he could not do more ; could not with the power of the Master's commission make fools"], [228, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 216 wise, the cruel gentle, the churl liberal, the unclean clean. But one of the two great thorns in Miles North's flesh at this date was his cousin, Tony North, who, by the vicar's free will, had found a refuge in the out-of-the-way Devon shire vicarage, and was there as a scourge to lash its master's pride, official and per sonal : since, do as he might, strive as he would, every appeal which he made to that polished and caUous specimen of humanity fell off as from a wall of adamant. The other source of torment calculated to weaken the young clergyman's sense of satis faction was, strange to say, his humble ad mirer, Lucy Endicott. He knew her sad history, he pitied her from the bottom of his heart, he would fain have protected her if he could. He did more ; he apprehended with a subtle mixture of pleasure and pain the light in which he himself appeared to Lucy \u2014 as more like a god than a man, as the most enviable of human beings. Did he not bear"], [229, "A CLERICAL VISITOR 217 an honest name? Was not his calling \u2014 which he worthily fulfilled \u2014 the most honourable of all callings? Could it not be said truly of him that he had nothing to hide and nothing to fear ; that his antecedents were as irre proachable as his present life was, and that he was a tower of strength against all future errors and failures ? How different this man, happy in his ability and goodness, his absolute safety, his clear conscience, his creditable family traditions, from a poor girl like Lucy, who had inherited nothing save disgrace, who could not claim her right in any of the good which coming years might bring, whose pro spects were altogether uncertain and rather hopeless, who had no faith in herself, who felt driven as an unfortunate fate and Ceha might drive her ! Yet Lucy did not cry out against the in equality of human fortunes, or complain that the Judge of all the world had not acted fairly by her. She bore no grudge against Miles North for being possessed of all that she"], [230, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 218 wanted. She accepted her lot so far meekly and resignedly, and contented herself with humbly admiring what she could not dream of rivalling. Miles North saw the attitude of her mind from the first time that his eyes met those of Lucy in his parish church, and, without con fessing it to himself, feared it for both of them. He felt that it held an indescribable tempta tion for him in what ought to have been his great superiority in years, character, posi tion, experience \u2014 everything. He felt himself drawn by a powerful attraction ; and he had not the slightest desire \u2014 on the contrary, he believed that he had an invincible objection \u2014 to be thus attracted. Of the two sisters Miles North disliked Celia ; but he feared Lucy with her blue eyes, her yellow hair, her artless ex aggerated regard for himself, with something hke an instinctive dread. It was, therefore, no slight effort for him to come and sit there opposite to her, to look round him at the poor bare sitting-room with"], [231, "A CLERICAL VISITOR 219 hardly any of the conventional attributes of a gentleman's home, to glance at her and in advertently reckon up the elements of sweet ness and modesty which belonged to her, if she had ever had a fair chance given her. It was a still greater trial to him to interfere in her private affairs, and seek to give her sound counsel and needful warning. Miles North received no support in what he was going to do, either from Celia or Lucy. Celia sat and looked demurely at him, with her head a trifle on one side, as if she were taking stock of him, and preparing to make her own of him in the way of amusement. Lucy's admiration was too much mingled with awe to permit her to speak readily. She sat and trembled lest she should say or do any thing amiss, lest she should displease him even when she was virtually worshipping him.

My language is patriarchal and Biblical \u2014 that is the effect of your company. By-the-bye, don't condemn me for the contents of the book you are handling. It is not mine, it is borrowed.

He turned to the fly-leaf of what proved a French novel, by Daudet. Above the title was scrawled 'Anthony North.' The visitor's countenance could not be said to fall or even to change, but he closed the book hastily as if he had seen something dis agreeable to him. Before he could make any remark Lucy faintly deprecated what she imagined might be his wrath. ' I have hardly looked into it. If it is not a nice book, of course I shall not read it. If you do not approve of it, I shaU not open it again. As Celia said, it was only for my French. I am afraid I shall forget it all, and that would be a pity, would it not, after the trouble and expense of acquiring it ?

Old lesson-books, how ever good, are dry by association, I suppose."], [234, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 222 Mr. North offered me a loan of this book, but I'll return it at once if you think I had better not keep it.' Lucy finished her confused jumble of apology and defence by meta phorically sinking at her vicar's feet with an instant offer of entire submission. ' You need not,' said Mies in his some what slow formal way, though his blood was coursing rapidly in his veins, and his heart beating more in accordance with his years than with the discipline of his life. ' I know the book, it is Daudet's \" Nabob,\" a great and famous book in its way. I should not think you could get much harm while you might get some good from that.

What might not even a newspaper lead to when the tinder was laid ready for the fire ? He gave another turn to his sentence \u2014 ' You may keep up French without the use of a newspaper. By the-bye,' he added hurriedly, as if a new idea had struck him, ' I suspect my cousin has not a much better choice in newspapers than he has in books. I should be sorry for you to have recourse to his stock.' ' I thought it was the Pope who published a list of forbidden books,' said Ceha, with the greatest apparent candour and desire for information. ' You do not mean to say that you, a Protestant, a Church of England clergy man, are going to take such a responsibility on your shoulders ? ' ' No, Miss Endicott ; and if I did I don't suppose it would be of much consequence where you were concerned,' said Miles, net tled by her tone. ' I can imagine that you judge for yourself on that, as on most matters.'"], [236, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 224 ' What a relief it must be to you ! ' said Ceha, with lively conviction. Lucy was waiting with her heart on her lips, so anxious was she to interpose to prevent Mr. North's being hurt, and to keep Celia from exhibiting some of those ' ways ' of hers. She was never loth to display them when she had such a rabid antipathy to an opponent as she had where the Rev. Miles North was concerned. ' You were speaking about the moor, Mr. North,' broke in Lucy. ' Yes. we usually walk in that direction, like most of the people here who have time to walk. They are generally the few summer visitors. They seem to go out on the moor as a matter of course, for the lanes are so rough ; not that walking on the moor is much O ' -_ better.' Poor Lucy spoke in a rueful tone, which betrayed plainly enough, without such an intention on her part, that hers was not the voice which decided even so small a matter in daily life as the direction of a walk.

Miles could not help giving way to a laugh, in spite of the burden on his mind, and his clerical decorum, which was doubly starched in the Endicotts' company. ' I dare say your sister does not mind.

I could not stand it ; if it came in my way I should give the would-be coward something to justify her panic' ' But, Celia, I am sure you know that I cannot helj:. feeling lonely and frightened,' said Lucy piteously ; while Miles North looked straight before him, and wished with all his heart that Ceha could meet her match.

But Celia only said in her indifferent tone, ' Standards differ.' She was neither touched by his earnestness nor affronted by the cir cumstance that he had found it necessary to give her such a warning. The only feeling she showed was a touch of haughtiness, and even that was balanced by the monkey-like pleasure of leading him into a labyrinth, and secretly laughing at him, while at the same time she forced him to speak out what he was reluctant to say. ' Does it not occur to you,' she said again, with an exasperating assumption of candid superiority, ' that though Lucy and I are girls we may be quite able to take care of ourselves, and that if Jem does not object, no third person, not even a clergy man, is entitled to find fault ?

When she passed the couple on the road so late she would not have known the gentle man to be Mr. Tony North, the parson's cousin, had it not been for his build and walk, which were like those of none other in the place, unless it were the parson ; and it was not he, else he would have hailed Mrs. Wayland and challenged her for being abroad at that hour."], [246, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 234 He had more need to challenge his gentleman cousin and the light-o'-head young miss from Blackhall, whose cloak and veil Mrs. Wayland could swear to, even in the failing light, be cause there were no other cloak and veil of the same shape and colour in the neighbour hood. For that matter, the natives of Ox cleeve were not wont to wear cloaks and veils on a May evening.

If so, Mrs. Wayland's master would have sent his daughter home in double quick time with a box on the ear, though she w7as a lass, fit to make it tingle for the rest of the night, while he would have broken half the bones in her companion's body before he had stopped.

It was iU taking out of the flesh what was bred in the bone, though Sally Beaver would stand up for the Endicotts because her man served them. She would have a rare job before she was done. It was a bad example for the parish. The parson's cousin, too ! Why did Mr. North harbour an idle gentleman who was never about any good, when he was about aught under the sun ; and why did he permit such ongoings under his very nose ? Miles North in his office of vicar did not hsten to half the story, neither was it con veyed to him simply in Mrs. Wayland's ram bling, but not ungraphic, way of telling it. Mrs. Reynolds added a stilted summing-up, and a few mincing, yet blighting, innuendoes. But he caught this much of the facts, that one of the Miss Endicotts had been impru dently compromising herself by unseasonable strolls in which she had the attendance of his cousin. The Miss Endicott who had been so foolish had been recognised by her cloak and"], [248, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 236 veil. It was Lucy Endicott, and not Celia, who sometimes wore a grey cloak and veil. Celia never wore either dust-cloaks to protect her frocks, or veils to shelter her complexion. Celia, even if she had been the defaulter, or if she was cognizant of all her sister did, could hardly know what it was he had heard, or how it was puzzling and paining him. Yet it was as if she divined the truth by the help of the mocking devil in her. For the next moment she put herself in the favourite position which she had used in her conver sation with Lucy that morning. Celia planted her elbows on the table which stood between her and the visitor, clasped her hands, rested her square white chin on them, and, looking him full in the face with a daring malicious glance, brought him to book instead of suffer ing that indignity at his hands.

We happen to walk out on the moor, which it seems all the idle people in Oxcleeve are gregarious in doing. We come across a gentleman to whom we were first introduced in your company, and consent that he should let us see where this beacon or that pool, which, of course, we are dying to discover, is to be sought and found. If he should chance to have so much leisure on his hands, and to be in a sufficiently oblig ing mood, it may occur to him that it may be as well in case of accidents, after having led us into the wilds, that he should lead us out again. And we may be of the same opinion. Now, the greatest scandalmonger in the most peddling little town in England could not make much out of that. You may be inclined to take a good deal upon yourself \u2014 excuse me, but gentlemen, whether old or young, who wear long coats and white ties {there seems something demoralising in the dress), frequently do ; still, even you cannot be in the habit of calling to account every"], [250, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 238 girl in your parish who exchanges a word, or a score of words, and walks a yard, or it may be a mile, with a gentleman of whom, though he is a relation of yours, and has eaten your bread, it is an open secret that you do not approve. There must be more behind, a great deal more, and one of us must be guilty. Let us be plain-spoken. Who walks alone with Tony North, not only in broad day, but under the starlight ? Who forces a most estimable and much-exercised young clergy man who has more to do than he knows how to accomplish, and ought to be infinitely better employed, to come over to Blackhall and ask her what she has got to say for her self? But, Mr. North, there are two of us here. The innocent ought not to be con demned with the guilty. Who is it that meets and walks with Tony North at un hallowed hours?' Miles North was dumb before the auda cious challenge ; but he felt it was a relief, though unacknowledged and hardly realised"], [251, "'WHO WALKS WITH TONY NORTH?' 239 at the time, that Lucy did not go into hysterics or faint on the spot. She simply sat as if spell-bound, open-eyed, open-mouthed, staring like a fascinated bird at Ceha, who looked round triumphantly. But an end was suddenly put to the triumph, and to the clergyman's call. Jem's foot was heard entering the house. Miles North got up to greet the master of the house, and, after a few words of baldish ordi- nary conversation, elected to take his leave. He did not feel equal to prolonging his visit without appealing to Jem ; and to do that, though he had spoken of it as a possible con- tingency, would be to constitute himself the instrument of forcing matters to a climax, and bringing about a scene of family expo- sure, wrangling, and recrimination \u2014 the very result which most men dread above all things. Miles North was not unhke his kind. He could have braved the odium which such a deed would involve in the course of his duty, but he did not see himself justified in taking"], [252, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 240 the obnoxious step on the instant, or as com pelled in obligation of his office to put his foot farther than he had already put it. He delayed the evil day, trying to fortify himself, not very successfully, with the mental assur ance that at least he had warned the Miss Endicotts of what was known and thought of their escapades. Forewarned might be fore armed with them, as with a few \u2014 a very few \u2014 indiscreet persons hurrying on the road to discomfiture, if not destruction. When Miles North was gone, and Jem had taken the gun for shooting wild pigeons which he had come to fetch, and gone on his errand of slaughter, a dead silence prevailed for several minutes between the sisters \u2014 one of whom had been as cruelly agitated and unfit to hold up her head wdien Miles North shook hands with her as the other was per fectly unembarrassed and able to look in his grave, disapproving eyes, and still wear her disdainful smile. At last Lucy broke out in woeful protest :"], [253, "WHO WALKS WITH TONY NORTH?' 241 ' Oh ! how could you be so unkind, so unjust, Celia ? ' ' Why, what did I do or say ?

' I told him the innocent should not be con demned with the guilty \u2014 was not that quite right? I asked him who it was that met and walked with Tony North at unseasonable hours \u2014 was that not perfectly fair and above board ? He might have said more. You might have spoken out. I am sure it was not I who gagged either or both of you. Oh ! you are the goosiest goose, Lucy. But I am rather tired of your goosiness at this moment. Perhaps bringing goosiness to Oxcleeve is like carrying coals to Newcastle. Certainly I have had enough of it for one morning.

She came with her couple of not very young and not very aggressive maid-servants, her pony carriage and pair of dun ponies \u2014 a working match, trustworthy and service able, without presenting anything particularly dainty or dashing in horseflesh.

That rare quality, modesty, seemed to be a distinguishing feature of the last product of the colonies. Lady Jones's great aim, as far as George Fielding could see \u2014 and he observed her with some interest from the beginning \u2014 was to do everything as unobtru sively and unassumingly as possible. If she made a mistake in wishing to shun public attention, it was in being almost too quiet and simple in her tastes and too sparing in her demands. It was a little surprising to think of a lady who had dwelt in a Govern ment House installing herself in a clumsy, overgrown, hoary cottage, which was all that the Court could pretend to be, Avithout the slightest right, even in its reformed character, to tack on the word ornee as a fit adjunct to its name. In addition, she furnished the ancient house almost in keeping, and that not strictly in an \u00e6sthetic taste, with what might have been the habits of its former occupants.

It remained Avithout saying that Australia Avas not like India, Avhich since the days of Solomon has furnished its governors, and, as a matter of course, their Avidows, with spoils of ivory and ebony, Avrought gold and silver, and the skins of slain tigers, together with living apes, to embellish and render cheerful Western homes. But not a single opossum skin, not a plume of dried grass, not a stuffed bird or an empaled moth, did Lady Jones bring with her to show, like the palm branch and the cockle-shells of the pilgrim of old, the strange lands Avhere she had been. She seemed to have carried aAvay nothing of her former treasures, save the"], [259, "LADY JONES AT HOME 247 portrait of the departed governor, and that she had duly hung up in one of the sitting rooms. These were of so nearly the same small square size, Avith so slight a difference in their utilitarian belongings, that, as Mrs. Reynolds complained, it gave a visitor un necessary trouble to decide which was the dining-room and which the drawing-room. Dear Lady Jones was so pecuhar in some of her ways. It was a pity that she did not take a hint from the excellent arrangements in the house across the Green, with regard to which its owner could reflect confidently that nobody in his senses was in danger of mis taking the proper habitat of mahogany and Russian leather, a sideboard, a dining-table, and the late Dr. Reynolds's easy chair, for that other and more elegant habitat, which was always kept in apple-pie order for visitors, the chosen home of rosewood and bamboo, china and ladies' work. The portrait of the late Sir Benjamin Jones, which could not be called a trophy of"], [260, "248 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS high art, though it seemed to supply a forcible likeness, represented a hale, bluff, elderly man in full dress, with a massive gold chain and an equally massive gold ring, Avhich looked as if they had come from the diggings. But these possible insignia of office Avere the only vul gar things, Avhatever else might be healthily homely and prosaic in the painted version of the defunct governor. Lady Jones's reserve did not extend to any disinclination to discuss the picture or its original. ' Yes,' she said directly, in answer to a hesitating suggestion, ' he Avas a great deal older than I. He Avas an honest man and a kind man. Everybody Avho had any thing to do with him acknowledged his worth. It Avas an honour to be connected with him,' she ended, with sensitive pride.

What were simplest, what answered her few requirements best, without asking in return for anything save the most cursory notice, appeared to suit her.

There Avas another short silence, during which Mrs. Reynolds's shreAvd side came into play. Lady Jones Avas an odd Avoman in every respect \u2014 Mrs. Reynolds had found out that before noAv. It was perfectly true that in such intercourse as had already passed between the ladies, the elder, and much the longer resident at Oxcleeve, had not been able, by exerting the utmost ingenuity, to worm"], [280, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 268 out anything with regard to her ladyship's antecedents ; above all, as to how and when she had knoAvn the moor and Oxcleeve in former days. The moor was a wide Avord, and she might ha A7e approached it from the other side, which was far enough away ; but then she had been evidently familiar with Oxcleeve. Her present announcement might be merely that of an eccentric woman, with some love of mischief where one would have least expected to find it, who traded on the shortness of her acquaintance with Mrs. Rey nolds to mystify her. Lady Jones might have other motives, bred of mortification caused by her infirmity, of social laziness and self will, for declining the regular visiting with her neighbours, which she had from the first deprecated. Mrs. Reynolds, with all her follies and affectations, had enough sagacity to divine thus far, and to judge also that the lady's declaration Avas not at all like that of an ordinary impostor or adventuress, who Avould have been only too eager to secure all"], [281, "A SINGULAR STATEMENT 269 the advantages of the situation, and to conceal the truth till it was past concealment. Mrs. Reynolds summoned up all her dignity to meet the emergency. ' Lady Jones,' she said, with some spirit, ' if I have shown myself satisfied Avith Avhat I know of you, I do not think you need have troubled yourself to assure me that you will not answer questions which I have not presumed to put. I am sensible of what I owe to myself as Avell as to you. I am not aware that I have ex pressed any impertinent curiosity as to your past history.' The rebuke was just. Lady Jones admitted it by hanging her silvered head. ' No,' she said, ' you have been friendly, you have taken me on trust hitherto. But I thought you might reasonably expect that I should in time aUude to my connections and my youth, and tell, for instance, Iioav I came to be nearly utterly friendless as I am.

' There are other circumstances in my life, which, judged by a different standard from mine, you might not approve of \u2014 you might thoroughly condemn.

' Well, Lady Jones, you have made a singular exception,' said Mrs. Reynolds drily. ' If Jem Endicott has not the civility to call on his tenant, I do not think you need run after him.

Certainly you are safe from the danger of encountering other company at Blackhall,' said Mrs. Reynolds, with a sneer, ' and you may be under no fear of com promising the Miss Endicotts \u2014 silly, giddy things both, and an impertinent minx one of them.' ' Is not that the very reason Avhy I should go ? ' said Lady Jones coldly, but with a re pressed fire in her coldness. ' If no other person goes near them, then they may be the better of me \u2014 a woman like themselves ; an older woman, but not so much older as to be beyond sympathising with them ; a stranger in the place, who has nothing to lose, while she is sensible of drawbacks in her own"], [284, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 272 circumstances which might prevent her also from being welcome everywhere.' ' I'd take care of being quixotic,' Mrs. Reynolds hastily implored her companion, as if she were Avarning her against something Avhich was at once extremely improper and decidedly dangerous. ' It never answers ; it's simply an encouragement to wrong-doers. But, so far as you yourself are concerned, I am persuaded that you are too scrupulous.' Mrs. Reynolds took up the old argument where she had left it off, acting in her OAvn interest. She was stoutly determined to hold to her course and not to be baulked of the advantages \u2014 dAvindling as they might be before her eyes \u2014 which might accrue to her from continuing her acquaintance Avith the late Australian governor's widow. Mrs. Rey nolds could be stubborn with the best at that game ; besides, she had already gone too far to retreat with flying colours.

At the same time Mrs. Reynolds secretly registered a resolution to be more careful for her friends than for herself. She would hold back the lavish introductions which she had pressed on the mistress of the Court, to all the best families within visiting distance. Above all, Mrs. Reynolds Avould be careful to keep her sister Amelia, Mrs. Barnes, at a distance from a doubtful protegee, even though she Avas a rich Avoman and the widoAv of an Australian governor.

' Then, Mrs. Reynolds,' said Lady Jones, ' if you Avill not consent to drop me, you must accept the responsibility, as you are now aAvare of the terms on which we stand, and the sole conditions on which our acquaintance can continue. I visit noAvhere unless on business or where my presence may be a decided gain. Of course I am not so foolish as to imagine it would be so to you, while I am happy to receive you if you are good enough to come here after what I have said.' The speaker looked half weary, half pleased while she spoke, for it is a small satisfaction to most of us to find that our personal recommendations are such as to render our temporary associates reluctant to give us up under whatever pre tence. Besides, this Avoman Avas terribly lonely in a place Avhich she had once knoAvn well. ' There you are too modest,' Mrs. Reynolds was saying, With nods and becks and wreathed smiles,"], [287, "A SINGULAR STATEMENT 275 ' as if I should not regard it as a great favour to have you stepping in and letting us enjoy one of our nice cosy chats, Avhen I am sitting by myself, and feeling what I call decidedly dozy.

HoAvever, we'll have another talk about it by-and-by, since I am to be alloAved to come here.' Mrs. Reynolds simpered and tittered, shook hands, and boAved herself out. Lady Jones felt considerable relief and gratitude at having surmounted an ordeal without alienating the only friend, such as she Avas, whom the new-comer could call hers, in the county. In addition, she had a dash 1 2"], [288, "276 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS of frank, colonial hospitality \u2014 she accom panied Mrs. Reynolds into the porch, and stood with her for a minute or t avo betAveen the unoccupied stone seats, looking down the straight flagged pathway through the rose bushes and tiger-lilies, and the overarching ash trees which framed a vignette of one of the many village greens. At this instant the vignette Avas made up principally of a family group passing along. ' Why, there are the very Endicotts we were speaking of,' cried Mrs. Reynolds. ' And there is a sight for you which may rank among the wonders of the world : one of the boarding-school misses has Mr. Jem's arm !

When Lucy reached the closed gate she found that Lady Jones outside had alighted without any help, save that Beaver had taken the ponies' reins. But her face was very white as she stood in her plain black dress, which might have been that of a religious order, for mortification and penance, before the closed gate and clutched at the bars for support.

In place of being aU right, Lady Jones was all wrong in the meantime. Lucy could feel that her companion was shaking in every limb, and could hardly keep on her tottering feet. Her hand on Lucy's arm closed on the slender support with a convulsive grip. She was forced to lean so heavily, that when the two came within the fuchsia hedges into the porch Lucy had almost to drag her visitor across the threshold. ' Oh dear !

But though Lucy had been educated under a professor of English literature, and had been taught to read and repeat a good many of the masterpieces of the Enghsh classics, she left it to another Avoman, who"], [306, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 294 had been under no professor, English or foreign, to recall by a flash of thought the attitude of Christabel and Geraldine before the castle of the poet's unfinished dream. ' I shall be all right presently,' repeated Lady Jones, with a slight chatter of her teeth, while she gave a quick glance round the for lornness of the stripped, neglected hall.

Jem was enough of a gentleman to come forward with a shamefaced apology. ' I ought to have called on you, Lady Jones,' he said stiffly, but not discourteously, ' only I have a great deal to do and am not remark ably clever in getting it done, as Fielding may have told you.

Jem could not do otherAvise than take her hand, Avhile she took his and grasped it for a second, as a seal of their friendship, before she dropped it.

The betrayal of it was a source of lively gratification to the morbid temper of the offender, and at the same time caused her to despise the person against whom she had sinned ten times more than before.

As it did not transpire from Lady Jones's talk of the difference between the Australian and the English climates, and betAveen colo nial and home life, that she had any motive in her visit beyond the supposed obligation to make the acquaintance of her landlord and his family, Jem, who rather prided himself on not being a ladies' man, soon excused him self and went out, leaving the stranger to the tender mercies of his sisters."], [312, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 300 Lucy was an adept at small-talk, and ran on in a shallow limpid stream, the chief ele ments of which were the weather, the moor \u2014 which was not equal to corn-fields or wood lands, while it represented the scenery of the neighbourhood \u2014 and the dreadful difficulty of having no shops to speak of nearer than Ashford. At last Lucy had nearly expended the pearls of her discourse, and had recourse to the summer visitors beginning to quarter themselves in the farmhouses skirting the moor. She did not know any of these birds of passage \u2014 she was not in circumstances to make cursory acquaintances, or, for that matter, acquaintances of any kind. She spoke with a little hesitation from this con sciousness, and from the twin conscious ness that it would have been a great deal more natural to speak of the few resident gentlefolks, supposing she had really felt herself one of them. But poor Lucy, with all her amiable make-believes, was not able"], [313, "MAHOMET GOES TO THE MOUNTAIN 301 to do that ; and not being able, she could not assume the feeling, as Celia could have assumed it, without the slightest scruple for any end of her own, or merely to throw dust in the eyes of a listener. Lady Jones scarcely heard her entertainer, though she was not constitutionally an absent minded woman, and though she had come to Blackhall with the express purpose of making the Endicotts' acquaintance and of learning all she could about them. She was yielding to an influence which carried her mind on another current, and only spoke an assenting word now and then. Occasionally Celia condescended to in terpose with a remark generally disconcert ing to her sister or to their visitor, or to both. Lucy noticed Lady Jones's eyes wandering here and there, and showing a perverse incli nation to settle on the pencil-marks on the window-shutter, but she took no notice of what must proceed from accident and not"], [314, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 302 design. It was Celia who drew attention to the undesirable direction of Lady Jones's vagrant glances. 'You may be tempted to think that we add up our accounts on our window-shutters, as I have heard university men sometimes write their notes of lectures on their linen cuffs, but indeed we do not,' she explained, with a great pretence of sincerity and can dour. ' We have enough of accounts here, but when we write them down we confine ourselves to paper. I am not sure that we have the wit to do anything else. If we had, we might keep them still more continu ally before our eyes, by embroidering them in columns on our frocks, or my brother might sow the columns in his turnip- fields, as ama teur gardeners and station-masters so av their names and the names of their stations in flower-seeds in their plots and on their rail way banks.

I hope you admire the Rever end Miles's eloquence, Lady Jones, for if you don't you will find yourself in the minority here.' Lady Jones frowned a little and said no thing. It was clear that she did not regard the dragging in of the vicar's name as in particularly good taste. Lucy hastened to make a diversion in the conversation, while she turned the cheeks which had grown brilliantly pink full upon her visitor, in preference to exposing their heightened colour to her sister. ' Celia likes to talk nonsense. This room was the old schoolroom. I told you my brother had not got his house in order yet.' ' He is a long time about it,' put in Celia, with the most naive air. 'He has been settled here for the last six years.' ' There was a custom of marking the children's height as they grew, on that shutter,' went on Lucy, 'and it had been"], [316, "304 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS done on one occasion Avith so sharp a pencil that it won't rub out. We must wait till we have the painters in the house. Celia and I are not there; it was before our day,' she said hastily, as she detected an amount of interest in Lady Jones which might forebode a proposal to examine the shutter with an accompaniment of awkAvard ques tions. ' My brother's name is there, and, of the four other names, t avo are those of a sister and brother older than Jem, and two are of little brothers between him and us, who all died long ago,' said Lucy, with a fall in her voice befitting the sadness of the state ment. 'Yes, and there is a fifth name, that of the eldest of the family \u2014 she is dead also,' said Celia composedly. ' I should like to look at them,' said Lady Jones abruptly. She did not ask further per mission, she crossed the room and stood be fore the shutter. The record, in a sloping handwriting all awry, ran as follows : \u2014"], [317, "MAHOMET GOES TO THE MOUNTAIN 305 Anna, 5 feet. Laura, 4 feet 8 inches. Tom, 4 feet 6 inches. Jem, 4 feet. Bill, 3 feet 1 inch. Baby, 2 feet 4 inches. (He was held up by nurse, and as he did not like it, and struggled, I dare say his height is not accurately given.) Beneath the other writing a short sentence was written in a different and bolder hand : \u2014 Jack still holds her own. Lady Jones stood and stared at the cha racters, rather scratched than written, which refused to be erased, till a cloud came before her eyes. She might be a highly imaginative woman, to whom the simple chronicle was enough to bring vividly before her a family group in one of its few and far between moments of harmony and happiness, ere the home-life had been blasted. She might see the busthng, important mother, the blooming chUdren, the father, a little apart, professing not to care for the small ceremony which was vol. 1. x"], [318, "306 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS intended, no doubt, to be annual till the time of groAvth ceased, but impelled to notify his satisfaction in the supremacy of his firstborn child and favourite daughter. Where were they now, the mother pre siding in the place of honour, the excited, amused boys and girls, down to the rebel lious baby, the watching father, shy of watch ing such womanish folly, which involved wildly random, truly feminine measurement ? Lady Jones spoke at last in a low, sub dued voice : ' There were many of you then ; ' yet her eyes did not travel up and down the list of names, the most of them no longer heard on earth. Her gaze was riveted, aa if fascinated, on the last scrawled sentence : ' Jack still holds her own.' Celia spoke with a jarring laugh, in answer to her ladyship's long look. ' But we are most of us dead, didn't you hear Lucy and me say ? and well for most of us \u2014 a good riddance, people would say, if the truth were always in fashion.'"], [319, "MAHOMET GOES TO THE MOUNTAIN 307 ' Oh, Ceha ! ' protested Lucy half under her breath, in horror. ' Well, Lucy,' retorted Celia undauntedly, ' you don't mean to say that you wish the dead alive again ? Poor miserable little crea tures. I hope you have more sense and good feehng. What would your clergyman say to you ? Does he not preach that aU is for the best?' ' Do you mean that all the members of the family whose names are written there are dead, with the exception of your brother ? ' asked Lady Jones. Her manner was still duU and mechanical ; she spoke as if she were goaded into speech by Celia's flighty, irreverent way of dealing with the subject. Lucy hesitated and looked up at the dim writing, whUe her colour went and came. ' Yes,' said Celia, with unfaltering decision, ' all of them. We are three, and I believe I may say without any great sin against modesty that we are improved specimens of the rest of the lot. By the way, Lucy, how"], [320, "308 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS like your writing is to those scratches on the shutter! I don't know that I have observed it before.' The last remark was in itself harmless enough, but it was delivered with a peculiarly offensive, malicious intonation. Lucy winced and was silent. Suddenly Lady Jones turned upon the girls in a white blaze of indignation. ' And why should the two handAvritings not resemble each other ? ' she demanded. ' This is your mother's hand writing, is it not? And why may not the daughter's writing be like that of the mother, whose little pet she was, doubtless, in her childish days ? ' Bold as Celia might be, there was some thing of the buUy in her when she was grasped as one is bidden seize a nettle. She ceased to sting for the moment, while it was certain that she would not forget the indig nity of the grasp. She laughed confusedly, and the next instant tried to turn the tables. ' I dare say you have had enough of our juvenile dimensions as scribbled upon a"], [321, "MAHOMET GOES TO THE MOUNTAIN 309 window-shutter,' she said, addressing Lady Jones. ' What shaU we do next ? \u2014 fly into a passion, or pick each other's pockets ? ' ' We'U rather go home \u2014 at least I shall,' said Lady Jones. Whatever force of associa tion had caused her to fly into a passion, her wrath had subsided as quickly as it had risen. She was not only calm again ; there was, look ing at the difference in age and position, an almost piteous determination on the part of the widow of the late Sir Benjaman Jones to take everything which passed between her and the Endicotts in good part \u2014 to resent nothing and get on friendly terms with them. ' I hope you wiU come and see me soon \u2014 often \u2014 as often as it suits you, and bring your brother,' she begged them, quite flurried in her anxiety to propitiate the girls \u2014 so much younger, of so much less consideration, than herself. 'I don't visit, so that of course I have hardly any visitors. You will not meet anybody that you may not care to meet \u2014 tell your brother so ; neither he nor you"], [322, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 310 need scruple on that account. I shaU have you all to myself,' she ended, with a quick sigh. ' At least you are honest, Lady Jones,' said Ceha sarcastically ; 'you hold out no false lights, you don't propose to tempt us by in ducements which have no foundation.' Ceha was herself again in the outspoken scorn and cynicism \u2014 the fashion of the hour \u2014 which in her were exaggerated to the verge of distor tion. Lady Jones had cast the pearls of swift relenting and humble kindness at her adver sary's feet, and Celia's natural impulse in such a case always prompted her to turn and rend the unAvisely generous, wasteful shedder of the pearls. ' Oh, Celia, I am sure we shall be very glad to accept Lady Jones's kind invitation,' exclaimed Lucy, Avho was often tired of her own and of Celia's company, and felt truly grateful for the prospect of a change. ' And Jem,' said Celia demurely, ' will Jem feel very glad too ? '"], [323, "MAHOMET GOES TO THE MOUNTAIN 311 'I \u2014 I hope so. I trust Lady Jones will forgive me if I cannot speak for my brother,' said Lucy, with a little spirit, but with the ready tears of vexation starting to her eyes. ' Certainly,' said Lady Jones, with anxious gentleness. ' Come yourself if the others wUl not come \u2014 you may depend on being heartily welcome.' Ceha made a mental note of the compact, and appended to it what lawyers call a rider : ' Not if I know it, Miss Lucy ; I'll soon put a stop to these absurd prelimi naries to an impossible friendship. You are not yet out of leading-strings, my dear sister. You are not to get away from me \u2014 nobody ought to come between sisters. You belong to me by right, and you are necessary to me in default of anybody better.' Celia might alter her mind any day. She had repulsed Lady Jones's advances in sheer perversity, and in order to make herself of more consequence by holding back a favour when it was sohcited. But it might suit her in time to come to do otherwise. She might"], [324, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 312 find some counterbalancing advantage and entertainment in carrying on an intercourse to which everybody was not made free. Ceha considered that Lucy was an entirely different person. What was for her, Ceha, was not for Lucy, in the light of those self ish motives which were always paramount with the elder sister. Lucy was not worth very much, whether as a companion, a butt, or a scapegoat ; but, anyhow, she was not to be allowed to slip through Celia's grasp ing fingers. END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.
