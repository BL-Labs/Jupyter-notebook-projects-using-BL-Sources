CHAPTER THE FIRST, THE FLOOD. HEN Pliny lost his life, and Herculaneum was buried, Manchester was born. Whilst lava and ashes blotted from sight and memory fair and luxurious Roman cities close to the Capitol, the Roman soldiery of Titus, under their general Agricola, laid the foundations of a distant city Avhich now competes Avith the great cities of the Avorld. Where now rise forests of tall chimneys, and the hum of AN ARK OF SAFETY. whirling spindles, spread the dense woods of Arden ; and from the clearing in their midst rose the Roman castrum of Mamutium,* Avhich has left its name of Castle Field as a memorial to us. But where their summer camp is said to have been pitched, on the * Prior to the close of the Fourteenth Century, Manchester was written Mamecester. B"], [20, "The Manchester Man. 2 airy rock at the confluence of the rivers Irk and Irwell, sacred church and peaceful college have stood for centuries, and only antiquaries can point to Roman possession, or even to the baronial hall which the Saxon lord perched there for security. And only an antiquary or a very old inhabitant can recall Manchester as it was at the close of the last century ; and shutting his eyes upon railway-arch, station, and esplanade, upon Palatine buildings, broad roadways, and river embankments, can see the Irk and the Irwell as they were when the Cathedral was the Collegiate Church, with a diminutive brick wall three parts round its ancient graveyard. Then the irregular-fronted rows of quaint old houses which still, under the name of Half Street, crowd upon two sides of the churchyard, with only an intervening strip of a flagged walk between, closed it up on a third side, and shut the river (lying low beneath) from the view, with a huddled mass of still older dwellings, some of Avhich were thrust out of sight, and Avere only to be reached by flights of break-neck steps of rock or stone, and like their hoary fellows creeping down the narrow roadAvay of Hunt's Bank, overhung the Irwell, and threatened to topple into it some day. The Chetham Hospital or College still looks solidly down on the Irk at the angle of the streams ; the old Grammar School has been suffered to do the same ; and \u2014 thanks to the honest workmen who built for our ancestors \u2014 the long lines of houses known as Long Millgate are for the most part standing, and on the river side have resisted the frequent floods of centuries. In 1799 that line was almost unbroken, from the College (where it commenced at Hunt's Bank Bridge) to Red Bank. The short alley by the Town Mill, called Mill Brow, which led down to the wooden Mill Bridge, was little more of a gap than those narrow entries or passages which pierced the walls like"], [21, ""], [22, "5 5 4, -4 s. \\\\ I * _*\"_ is: I\u2014 o d si a, X ed 3 i. q r.

The houses themselves had been good originally, and were thus cramped together for defence in perilous times, when experience taught that a narrow gorge was easier held against warlike odds than an open roadway. Ducie Bridge had then no existence, but Tanners' Bridge \u2014 no doubt a strong wooden structure like that at Mill Brow \u2014 accessible from the street only by one of those narrow steep passages, stood Avithin a few yards of its site, and had a place on old maps so far back as 1650. Its name is expressive, and goes to prove that the tannery on the rocky banks of the Irk, behind the houses of Long Millgate, then opposite to the end of Miller's Lane, was a tannery at least a century and a half before old Simon Clegg worked amongst the tan-pits, and called William Clough master. To this sinuous and picturesque line of houses, the streams, with their rocky and precipitous banks, will have served in olden times as a natural defensive moat (indeed, it is noticeable that old Manchester kept pretty much within the angle of its rivers), and in 1799, from one end of Millgate to the other, the dwellers by the waterside looked across the stream on green and undulating uplands, intersected by luxuriant hedgerows, a bleachery at Walker's Croft, and a short terrace of houses near Scotland Bridge, denominated Scotland, being the sole breaks in the verdure. Between the tannery and Scotland Bridge the- river makes a sharp bend ; and here, at the elbow, another mill, Avith its corresponding dam, was situated. The current of the Irk, if not deep, is strong at all times, though kept by its high banks within narrow compass. But when, as is not unseldom the case, there is a sudden flushing of Avater from the hill-country, it"], [24, "The Manchester man. 4 rises, rises, rises, stealthily, though swiftly, till the stream overtops its banks, washes over low-lying bleach-crofts, fields, and gardens, mounts foot by foot over the fertile slopes, invades the houses, and, like a mountain-robber sweeping from his fastness on a peaceful vale, carries his spoil with him, and leaves desolation and Availing behind. Such a flood as this, following a heavy thunder-storm, devastated the valley of the Irk, on the 17th of August, 1799. Well Avas it then for the tannery and those houses on the bank of the Irk which had their foundations in the solid rock, for the waters surged and roared at their base and over pleasant meadows \u2014 a widespread turbulent sea, with here and there an island of refuge, which the day before had been a lofty mound. The flood of the previous Autumn, when a coach and horses had been swept down the Irwell, and men and women were drowned, was as nothing to this. The tannery yard, high as it Avas above the bed of the Irk, and solid as was its embankment, Avas threatened with invasion. The surging water roared and beat against its masonry, and licked its coping with frothy tongue and lip, like a hungry giant, greedy for fresh food. Men with thick clogs and hide-bound legs, leather gloves and aprons, Avere hurrying to and fro with barrows and bark-boxes for the reception of the valuable hides which their mates, armed Avith long-shafted hooks and tongs, were dragging from the pits pell mell, ere the advancing waters should encroach upon their territory, and empty the tan-pits for them. Already the insatiate flood bore testimony to its ruthless greed. Hanks of yarn, pieces of calico, hay, uptorn bushes, planks, chairs, boxes, dog-kennels, and hen-coops, a shattered chest of drawers, pots and pans, had swept past, swirling and eddying in the flood, which by this time spread like a vast lake"], [25, "The Manchester Man. 5 over the opposite lands, and had risen within three feet of the arch of Scotland Bridge, and hardly left a trace where the mill-dam chafed it commonly. Too busy were the tanners, under the eye of their master, to stretch out hand or hook to arrest the progress of either furniture or live stock, though bee-hives and hen-coops, and more than one squealing pig, went racing Avith the current, now rising towards the footway of Tanners' Bridge. Every window of every house upon the lower banks was crowded with anxious heads, for flooded Scotland rose like an island from the watery waste, and their own cellars were fast filling. There had been voices calling to each other from Avindow to window all the morning ; but noAV from Avindow to Avindow, from house to house, rang one reduplicated shriek, Avhich caused many of the busy tanners to quit their work, and rush to the water's edge. To their horror, a painted wooden cradle, which had crossed the deeply-submerged dam in safety, was floating foot-foremost down to destruction, Avith an infant calmly sleeping in its bed ; the very motion of the waters having seemingly lulled it to sounder repose ! \" Good Lord ! It's a choilt ! \" exclaimed Simon Clegg, the eldest tanner in the yard. \" Lend a hand here, fur the sake o' th' childer at whoam.' Half a dozen hooks and plungers were outstretched, even Avhile he spoke ; but the longest was lamentably too short to arrest the approaching cradle in its course, and the unconscious babe seemed doomed. With frantic haste Simon Clegg rushed on to Tanners' Bridge, followed by a boy ; and there, with hook and plunger, they met the cradle as it drifted towards them, afraid of over-balancing it even in their attempt to save. It swerved, and almost upset ; but Simon dexterously caught his hook within the wooden hood, and drew the frail bark and its"], [26, "6 The Manchester Man. living freight close to the bridge. The boy, and a man named Cooper, lying flat on the bridge, then clutched at it with extended hands, raised it carefully from the turbid water, and drew it safely between the open rails to the footway, amidst the shouts and hurrahs of breathless and excited spectators. The babe Avas screaming terribly. The shock when the first hook stopped the progress of the cradle had disturbed its dreams, and its little fat arms Avere stretched out piteously as strange faces looked down upon it instead of the mother's familiar countenance. Wrapping the patchwork quilt around it, to keep it from contact with his wet sleeves and apron, Simon, tenderly as a woman, lifted the infant in his rough arms, and strove to comfort it, but in vain. His beard of three days growth was as a rasp to its soft skin, and the closer he caressed, the more it screamed. The men from the tannery came crowding round him. \" What dost ta mean to do Avi' th' babby ? \" asked the man Cooper of old Simon. \"Aw'd tak' it whoam to my missis, but th' owd lass is nowt to be takken to, an' Avur as cross as two sticks when oi only axed fur mi baggin* to bring to wark wi' mi this mornin',\" added he, with rueful remembrance of the scolding wife on his hearth. \"Neay, lad, aw'l not trust th' poor choilt to thy Sally.

Aw'll just tak it to ar' Bess, and hoo'll cuddle it up and gi' it summat to sup, till we find its own mammy,\" answered Simon, leaving the bridge. \" Bring the kaytherf alung, Jack,\" (to the boy) \"Bess'll want it.

But it's just a way hoo has, an' theere is na a fractious choilt i' a' ar yard but'll be quiet wi' Bess.\" Cooper looked after her, nodded an assent, and sighed, as if he wished some one in another yard had the same soothing way with her. But the voice of the raging water had not stilled like that of the rescued infant. Back went the two men to their task, and Avorked away with a will to carry hides, bark, and implements to places of security. And as they hurried to and fro Avith loads on back or barrow, up, up, inch by inch, foot by foot, the swelling flood rose still higher, till, lapping the foot-bridge, curling over the embankment, it drove the sturdy tanners back, flung itself into the pits, and, in many a swirling eddy, Avashed tan and hair and skins into the common current."], [30, "The Manchester man. 8 Not so much, however, went into its seething caldron as might have been, had the men Avorked with less vigour ; and, quick to recognise the value of ready service, Mr. Clough led his drenched and Aveary Avorkmen to the \" Skinners' Arms,\" in Long Millgate, and ordered a supply of ale and bread and cheese to be served out to them. At the door of the public-house, Avhere he left the tvorkmen to the enjoyment of this impromptu feast, he encountered Simon Clegg. The kind fellow had taken a hasty run to his own tenement, \" just to see heaw ar Bess an' th' babby get on ; \" and he brought back the intelligence that it was \" a lad, an' as good as goold.\" \" Oh, my man, I've been too much occupied to speak to you before,\" cried Mr. Clough. \" I saw you foremost in the rescue of that unfortunate infant, and shall not forget it. Here is a crown for your share in the good deed. I suppose that was the child's mother you gave it to ?\" Simon Avas a little man, but he dreAv back Avith considerable native dignity. \" Thenk yo', measter, all th' same, but aw connot tak' brass fur just doin' my duty.

It's agen' ma conscience. I'll tak' mi' share o' the bread an' cheese, an' drink yo'r health i' a sup o' ale, but aw cudna' tak' that brass if aw wur deein'.\" And Simon; giving a scrape with his clog, and a duck oi his head, meant for a bow, passed his master respectfully, and"], [31, "The Manchester Man. 9 went clattering up the steps of the \" Skinners' Arms,\" leaving the gentleman standing there, and looking after him in mingled astonishment and admiration."], [32, "CHAPTER THE SECOND. NO ONE KNOWS. HEN the scurrying Avater, thick with sand and mud, and discoloured with dye stuffs, which floated in brightly-tinted patches on its surface, filled the arch of Scotland Bridge, and left only the rails of Tanners' Bridge visible, the inundation reached its climax ; but a couple of days elapsed before the flood subsided below the level of the unprotected tannery-yard, and until then neither Simon Clegg nor his mates could resume their occupations. There was a good deal of lounging about Long Millgate and the doors of the \" Queen Anne \" and \" Skinners' Arms \" of heavily shod men, in rough garniture of thick hide \u2014 armoury against the tan and water in which their daily bread was steeped. But in all those two days no anxious father, no white-faced mother, had run from street to street, and house to house, to seek and claim a rescued living child. No, not even when the week had passed, though the story of his \"miraculous preservation\" was the theme of conversation at the tea-tables of gentility and in the bar-parlours of taverns ; was the gossip of courts and alleys, highways and byways ; and though echo, in the guise of a \" flying stationer,\" caught it up and spread it broadcast in catchpenny sheets, far beyond the confines of the inundation."], [33, "The Manchester Man. 11 This was the more surprising as no dead bodies had been washed down the river, and no lives were reported \" lost.\" Had the child no one to care for it ? \u2014 no relative to Avhom its little life was precious? Had it been abandoned to its fate, a waif unloved, uncared for ? The house in which Simon Clegg lived was situated at the very end of Skinners' Yard, a cul-de-sac, to which the only approach Avas a dark, covered entry, not four feet Avide. The pavement of the yard Avas natural rock, originally hewn into broad flat steps, but then worn with water from the skies, and from house- Avifely pails, and the tramp of countless clogs, to a rugged steep incline, asking wary stepping from the stranger on exploration after nightfall. Gas Avas, of course, unknown, but not even an oil-lamp lit up the gloom. In the sunken basement a tripe-boiler had a number of stone troughs or cisterns, for keeping his commodities cool for sale. The three rooms of Simon Clegg were situated immediately above these, two small bed-rooms overlooking the river and pleasant green fields beyond ; the wide kitchen Avindow having no broader range of prospect than the dreary and not too savoury yard. Even this view Avas shut out by a batting frame, resembling much a long, narrow French bedstead, all the more that on its canvas surface was laid a thick bed of raw (that is, undressed) cotton, freckled Avith seeds and fine bits of husky pod. Bess was a batter, and her business was to turn and beat the clotted mass Avith stout lithe arms and willow-Avands, until the fibres loosened, the seeds and specks fell through, and a billowy mass of whitish down lay before her. It Avas not a healthy occupation : dust and flue released found their way into the lungs, as well as on to the floor and furniture ; and a rosy-cheeked batter was a myth. Machinery does the work now \u2014 but this history deals with then !"], [34, "The Manchester man. 12 During the Aveek dust lay thick on everything; even Bessy's hair Avas fluffy as a bursting cotton pod, in spite of the kerchief tied across it ; but on the Saturday, when she had carried her work to Simpson's factory in Miller's Lane, and came back Avith her Avages, broom and duster cleared away the film ; wax and brush polished up the old bureau, the pride and glory of their kitchen ; the two slim iron candlesticks, fender and poker, Avere burnished bright as steel ; the three-legged round deal table was scrubbed Avhite ; and then, mounted on tall pattens, she set about Avith mop and pail, and a long-handled stone, to cleanse the flag floor from the Aveek's impurities. She had had a good mother, and, to the best of her ability, Bess tried to follow in her footsteps, and fill the vacant place on her father's hearth, and in his heart. Her mother had been dead four years, and Bess, noAV close upon twenty, had since then lost two brothers, and lamented as lost one dearer than a brother \u2014 the two former by death, the other by the fierce demands of war. She had a pale, interesting face, Avith dark hair and thoughtful, deep grey eyes, and was, if anything, too quiet and staid for her years ; but when her face lit up she had as pleasant a smile upon it as one would wish to see by one's fireside, and not even her dialect could make her voice othenvise than low and gentle. Both her brothers had been considerably younger than herself ; and possibly the fact of having stood in loco parentis to them for upwards of two years had imparted to her the air of motherliness she possessed. Certain it is that if a child in the yard scalded itself, or cut a finger, or knocked the bark off an angular limb, it went crying to Bessy Clegg in preference to its own mother ; and she healed bruises and quarrels with the same balsam \u2014 loving sympathy. She was just the one to open her arms and heart to a poor motherless babe, and Simon Clegg knew it."], [35, "The Manchester man. 13 Old Simon, or old Clegg, he was called, probably because he was graver and more serious than his fellows, and had never changed his master since he greAv to manhood ; certainly not on account of his age, which trembled on the verge of fifty, only. He was a short, somewhat spare man, Avith a face deeply lined by sorrow for the loved ones he had lost. But he had a merry twinkling eye, and was not without a latent vein of humour. The atmosphere of the tannery might have shrivelled his skin, but it had not withered his heart ; and when he handed the child he had saved to his daughter, he never stopped to calculate contingencies. The boy, apparently between two and three months' old, was dressed in a long gown of printed linen, had a muslin cap, and an under one of flannel, all neatly made, but neither in make nor material beyond those of a respectable working-man's child ; and there was not a mark upon anything which could give a clue to its parentage. The painted wooden cradle, which had been to it an ark of safety, Avas placed in a corner by the fireplace ; and an old bottle, filled Avith thin gruel, over the neck of Avhich Bess had tied a loose cap of punctured wash-leather, was so adjusted that the little one, deprived of its mother, could lie within and feed itself whilst Bess industriously pursued her avocations. These were not times for idleness. There had been bread riots the previous winter ; food still was at famine prices ; and it was all a poor man could do, with the strictest industry and economy, to obtain a bare subsistence. So Bess worked away all the harder, because there were times Avhen babydom was imperative, and Avould be nursed.

The iron porridge-pot was on the low fire, and Bess, sifting the oatmeal into the boiling water with the left hand, whilst with the other she beat it swiftly Avith her porridge-stick, was so intent on the preparation of their supper, she did not notice their entrance until her father, putting his coarse wicker market-basket doAvn on her white table, bade Cooper \" Coom in an' tak' a cheer.\" Instead of taking a chair, the man walked as quietly as his clogs Avould let him to the cradle, and looked down on the infant sucking vigorously at the delusive bottle.

Simon looked puzzled. \"Whoy, aw've hardly gi'en it a thoAvt.\" But the question, once started, was discussed at some length. Meanwhile the porridge destined for two Bess poured into three bowls, placing three iron spoons beside them with no more ceremony than, \"Ye'll tak' a sup wi' us, Mat.\" Mat apologised, feeling quite assured there was no more than the two could have eaten ; but Simon looked hurt, and the porridge was appetising to a hungry man ; so he handed the baby to the young woman, took up his spoon, and the broken thread of conversation was renewed at intervals. What they said matters not so much as what they did. The next morning being Sunday, Cooper called for Clegg just as the bells were ringing for church ; and the two, arrayed in their best fustian breeches, long-tailed, deep-cuffed coats, knitted hose, three-cornered hats, and shoes, only kept for Sunday wear, set out to seek the parents of the unclaimed infant, nothing doubting that they were going to carry solace to sorrowing hearts. Their course lay in the same track as the Irk, now pursuing its course as smilingly under the bright August sun as though its banks were not strewed with wreck, and foul with thick offensive mud, and the woeful devastations were none of its doing. There were fewer houses on their route than now, and they kept closely as possible to the course of the river, questioning the various inhabitants as they went along. They had gone through Collyhurst and Blakely without rousing anyone to a thought beyond self-sustained damage, or gaining a single item"], [38, "16 The Manchester man. of intelligence, though they made many a detour in quest of it. At a roadside public-house close to Middleton they sat down parched Avith heat and thirst, called for a mug of ale each, drew from their pockets thick hunks of brown bread and cheese, Avrapped in blue and white check handkerchiefs, and whilst satisfying their hunger came to the conclusion that no cradle could have drifted safely so far, crossing weirs and mill dams, amongst uprooted bushes, timber, and household chattels, and that it was best to turn back. In Smedley Vale, Avhere the flood seemed to have done its worst, and where a small cottage close to the river lay in ruins, a knot of people Avere gathered together talking and gesticulating as if in eager controversy. As they approached, they were spied by one of the group. \" Here are th' chaps as fund th' babby, an' Avant'n to know who it belungs to,\" cried he, a youth whom they had interrogated early in the day. To tell in brief what Simon and his companion learned by slow degrees \u2014 the hapless child was alone in the Avorld, orphaned by a succession of misfortunes. The dilapidated cottage had been for some fifteen months the home of its parents. The father, who was understood to have come from Crumpsall Avith his young wife and her aged mother, had been summoned to attend the death-bed of a brother in Liverpool, and had never been heard of since. The alarm and trouble consequent upon his prolonged absence prostrated the young Avife, and caused not only the babe's premature birth, but the mother's death. The care of the child had devolved upon the stricken grandmother, Avho had brought him up by hand, as MattheAv's sagacity had suggested. She Avas a Avoman far advanced in years, and feeble, but she asked no help from neighbours or parish, though her poverty was apparent. She kept poultry and knitted stockings,"], [39, "The Manchester man. 17 and managed to eke out a living somehow, but how, none of those scattered neighbours seemed to knoAv \u2014 she had \" held her yead so hoigh \" (pursued her way so quietly). She had been out in her garden feeding her fowls when the flood came upon them without Avarning, swept through the open doors of the cottage, and carried cradle and everything else before it, leaving hardly a wall standing. In endeavouring to save the child she herself got seriously hurt, and was Avith difficulty rescued. But between grief and fright, bruises and the drenching, the old dame succumbed, and died on the Thursday morning, and had been buried by the parish \u2014 from Avhich in life she had proudly kept aloof \u2014 that very afternoon, and no one could tell other name she had borne than Nan. Bess sobbed aloud Avhen she heard her father's recital, which lost nothing of its pathos from the homely vernacular in Avhich it was couched. \"An' what's to be done neaw?\" asked Cooper, as he sat on one of the rush-bottomed chairs, sucking the knob of his walking stick, as if for an inspiration. \"Yo canno' think o' keeping th' choilt, an' bread an' meal at sich a proice ! \" \" Connot oi ? Then aAv conno' think o' aught else. Wouldst ha' me chuck it V th' river agen?

But the extra labour and self-denial it involved on the part of Bess, neither Matthew nor Simon could estimate. In the midst of the rabid scepticism and Republicanism of the period, Simon Clegg was a staunch \" Church and King \" man, and, as a natural consequence, a stout upholder of their ordinances. Regularly as the bell tolled in for Sunday morning service, he might be seen walking reverently down the aisle of the old church, to his place in the free seats, Avith his neat, cheerful-looking daughter following him sometimes, but not always \u2014 so regularly that the stout beadle missed him from his seat the Sunday after the inundation, and meeting him in the churchyard a week later, sought to learn the why and wherefore. The beadle of the parish church was an important personage in the eyes of Simon Clegg ; and, somewhat proud of his notice, the little tanner related the incidents of that memorable flood-week to his querist, concluding with his adoption of the child. The official h'md and ha'd, applauded the act, but shook his powdered head, and added, sagely, that it was a \"greeat charge, a varry greeat charge.\" \"Dun yo' think th' little un's bin babtised?\" interrogated the beadle. \u25a0 Aw conno' tell ; nob'dy couldn't tell nowt abeawt th' choilt, 'ut wur ony use to onybody.

The other, the Reverend Joshua Brookes, a short, stumpy man (so like to the old knave of clubs in mourning that the sobriquet of the \" Knave of Clubs \" stuck to him), was a rough, crusted, unpolished black-diamond, hasty in temper, harsh in tone, blunt in speech and in the pulpit, but Avith a true heart beating under the angular external crystals ; and he was a good liver of another sort than his colleague. He was the son of a crippled and not too sober shoemaker, who, when the boy's intense desire for learning had attracted the attention and patronage of Parson Ainscough, went to the homes of several of the wealthy denizens of the town, to ask for pecuniary aid to send his son Joshua to college. The youth's scholarly attainments had already obtained him an exhibition at the Free Grammar School, which, coupled with the donations obtained by his father and the helping hand of Parson Ainscough, enabled him to keep his terms and to graduate at Brazenose, to become a master in the grammar school in which he had been taught, and a chaplain in the Collegiate Church. * See Appendix,"], [45, ""], [46, "REV. JOSHUA BROOKES, M.A. From it Woodbnry-type Photograph l>y Brothers."], [47, "The Manchester Man. 21 So conscientious was he in the performance of his sacred duties that, albeit he was wont to exercise his calling after a peculiarly rough fashion of his own, he married, christened, buried more people during his ministry than all the other ecclesiastics put together. It was to this Joshua Brookes (few ever thought of prefixing the \" Reverend \" in referring to him) that Simon Clegg brought \" Nan's \" orphan grandchild to be baptised on Tuesday, the 7th of September, just three weeks from the date of his involuntary voyage down the flooded Irk. It had taken the tanner the whole of the week following his conversation with the beadle to determine the name he should give the child, and many had been his consultations with Bess on the subject. That very Sunday he had gone home from church full of the matter, and lifting his big old Bible from its post of honour on the top of the bureau (it was his whole library), he sat, after dinner, with his head in his hands and his elbows on the table, debating the momentous question. \" Yo' see, Bess,\" said he, \" a neame as sticks to one all one's loife, is noan so sma' a matter as some folk reckon.

At the door they made way for the entrance of a party of ladies, Avhom they had seen alight from sedan-chairs at the upper gate, where a couple of gentlemen joined them. A nurse followed, with a baby, whose christening robe, nearly two yards Properly."], [49, "The Manchester man. 23 long, was a mass of rich embroidery. The mother herself, \u2014 a slight, lovely creature, additionally pale and delicate from her late ordeal \u2014 wore a long, plain-skirted dress of vari-coloured brocaded silk. A lustrous silk scarf, trimmed with costly lace, enveloped her shoulders. Her head-dress, a bonnet with a bag crown and Quakerish poke-brim, was of the newest fashion, as were the long kid gloves which covered her arms to the elbows. The party stepped forward as though precedence was theirs of right even at the church door, heeding not Simon's mannerly withdrawal to let them pass ; and the very nurse looked disdainfully at the calico gown of the baby in the round arms of Bess, a woman in a grey duffle cloak and old-fashioned flat, broad-brimmed hat, tied down over the ears. Is there any thrill, sympathetic or antagonistic, in baby-veins, as they thus meet there for the first time on their entrance into the church and the broad path of life? For the first time \u2014 but scarcely for the last. Already a goodly crowd of mothers, babies, godfathers and godmothers had assembled \u2014 a crowd of all grades, judging from their exteriors, for dress had not then ceased to be a criterion ; and all ceremonies of this kind were performed in shoals \u2014 not singly. The Rev. Joshua Brookes, followed by his clerk, came through the door in the carven screen, between the choir and baptismal chapel, and took his place behind the altar rails. And now ensued a scene which some of my readers may think incredible, but which was common enough then, and there, and is notoriously true. The width of the altar could scarcely accommodate the number of women waiting to be churched ; and the impatient Joshua assisted the apparitors to marshal them to their places, with a sharp \" You come here ! You kneel there ! Yon woman's not paid ! \" accompanied by pulls and pushes, until the semi-circle was silled."], [50, "The Manchester man. 24 But still the shrinking lady, and another, unused to jostle Avith rough crowds, Avere left standing outside the pale. Impetuous Joshua had begun the service before all were kttled. \" Forasmuch as it hath pleased \" His quick eye caught the outstanding figures. Abruptly stopping his exordium, he exclaimed, in his harsh tones, Avhich seemed to intimidate the lady, \" What are you standing there for ? Can't you find a place ? Make room here ! \" (pushing two women apart by the shoulder), \" thrutch up closer there ! Make haste, and kneel here ! \" (to the lady, pulling her forward). \" You come here ; make room, will you ? \" and having pulled and pushed them into place, he resumed the service. Presently there was another outburst. There had been a hushing of whimpering babies, and a maternal smothering of infantile cries, as a chorus throughout ; but one fractious little one screamed right out, and refused to be comforted. The nervous tremor on that kneeling lady's countenance might have told to whom it belonged, had Joshua been a skilful reader of hearts and faces. His irritable temper got the better of him. He broke off in the midst of the psalm to call out, \" Stop that crying child ! \" The crying child did not stop. In the midst of another verse he bawled, \" Give that screaming babby the breast ! \" He Avent on. The clerk had pronounced the \" Amen \" at the end of the psalm ; the chaplain followed, \" Let us pray;\" but before he began the prayer, he again shouted, \" Take that squalling babby out ! \" \u2014 an order the indignant nurse precipitately obeyed ; and the service ended Avithout further interruption. Then folloAved the christenings, and another marshalling (this time of godfathers and godmothers, with the infants they presented), in Avhich the hasty chaplain did his part with hands and voice until all were arranged to his satisfaction."], [51, "The Manchester Man. 25 It so happened that the tanner's group and the lady's group were ranked side by side. The latter was Mrs. Aspinall, the wife of a wealthy cotton merchant, who, with two other gentlemen and a lady, stood behind her, and this time gave her their much-needed supports Indeed, Avhat Avith the damp and dullness of the church, and the agitation, the delicate lady appeared ready to faint. \" Hath this child been already baptized or no ? \" asked Joshua Brookes, and was passing on, when Simon's unexpected response arrested him. \" Aw dunnot knoAv.\" \" Don't know ? How's that ? What are you here for ? \" were questions huddled one on the other, in a broader vernacular than I have thought Avell to put in the mouth of a man so deeply learned. \" Whoi, yo' see, this is the choilt as wur Aveshed deawn th' river wi' th' flood in a kayther ; an' o' belungin' th' lad are deead, an' aw mun kirsen him to mak' o' sure.\" Joshua listened with more patience than might have been expected from him, and passed on Avith a mere \" Humph ! \" to ask the same question from each in succession before proceeding Avith the general service. At length he came to the naming of several infants. \" Henrietta Burdelia Fitzbourne \" was given as the proposed name of a girl of middle-class parents. \" Mary, I baptise thee,\" &c, he calmly proceeded, handed the baby back to the astonished godmother, and passed to the next, regardless of appeal. Mrs. Aspinall's boy took his name of Laurence Avith a noisy protest against the sprinkling. Nor Avas the foundling silent when, having been duly informed that the boy's name Avas to be \" Irk\" self-willed Joshua deliberately, and with scarcely a visible pause, went on \u2014"], [52, "26 The Manchester man. \"Jabez, I baptise thee in the name,\" &c, and so overturned, at one fell swoop, all Simon's carefully-constructed castle. Simon attempted to remonstrate, but Joshua Brookes had another infant in his arms, and was deaf to all but his own business. Such a substitution of names Avas too common a practice of his to disturb him in the least. But Simon had a brave spirit, and stood no more in awe of Joshua Brookes \u2014 \" Jotty \" as he Avas called\u2014 than of another man. When the others had gone in a crowd to the vestry to register the baptisms, he stopped to confront the parson as he left the altar. \" What roight had yo' to change the neame aw chuse to gi'e that choilt ? \" \" What right had yo' to saddle the poor lad with an Irksome name like that 1 \" was the quick rejoinder. \" Roight ! why, aw wanted to gi'e th' lad a neame as should mak' him thankful for bein' saved from dreawndin' to the last deays o' his loife.\" \" An Irksome name like that would have made him the butt of every little imp in the gutters, until he'd have been ready to drown himself to get rid of it. Jabez is an honourable name, man. You go home, and look through your Bible till you find it.\" Simon Avas open to conviction ; his bright eyes twinkled as a new light dawned upon them. The gruff chaplain had brushed past him on his way to the robing-room ; but he turned back, with his right hand in his breeches pocket, and put a seven-shilling piece in the palm of the tanner, saying : \" Here's something towards the christening feast of th' little chap I've stood godfather to. And don't you forget to look in ' Chronicles ' for Jabez ; and, above all, see that the lad doesn't disgrace his name.\""], [53, "The Manchester man. 27 Joshua Brookes had the character, among those who knew him least, of loving money overmuch, and this unwonted exhibi tion of generosity took Simon's breath. The chaplain Avas gone before he recovered from his amaze ment \u2014 gone, with a tender heart softened towards the father less child thrown upon the world, his cynicism rebuked by the true charity of the poor tanner, who had taken the foundling to his home in a season of woeful dearth. And, to his credit be it said, the Rev. Joshua Brookes never lost sight of either Simon or little Jabez. He Avas wont to throw out Avords which he meant to be in season, but his harsh, abrupt manner, as a rule, neutralized the effect of his impromptu teachings. Now, however, the seed was thrown in other ground ; and, as he intended, Simon's curiosity was excited. The Bible was reverently lifted from the bureau as soon as they reached home, and after some seeking, the passage was found. Simon's reading was nothing to boast of, but Cooper could not read at all ; and in the eyes of his unlettered comrades Clegg shone as a learned man. He could decipher \" black print,\" and that, in his days, amongst his class, was a distinction. Slowly he traced his fingers along the lines for his own informa tion, and then still more slowly, with a sort of rest after every word, read out to his auditors \u2014 Bess, Matthew, and Matthew's wife (there in her best gown and best temper) \u2014 with slight dialectal peculiarities which need not be reproduced \u2014 And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren : and his mother called his name Jabez, because she bare him with sorrow.

And there was quite as happy a party under that humble roof in Skinners' Yard as that assembled in the grand house at Ardwick, where Master Laurence Aspinall was handed about in his embroidered robes for the inspection of guests who cared very little about him, although they did present him with silver mugs, and spoons, and corals, and protest to his pale and exhausted mamma that he was the finest infant in Manchester."], [56, "CHAPTER THE FOURTH MISCHIEF, was a time of distress at home and war abroad.

All nostrums were prescribed for the evils of famine except a stoppage of the war. The rich made sacrifices for the poor; pastry was banished by common consent from the tables of the wealthy in order to cheapen flour ; soup-kitchens were established for the poor, and in the midst of the general dearth the nineteenth century struggled into existence.

To her simple, uninformed mind, Ireland was as foreign and distant a country as Australia is to us in these days. And to be stationed there with his regiment amongst those \"Avild Irishmen,\" conveyed only the idea of battles and bloodshed. Yet she kept a brave heart on the matter, and hid her anxieties from her father as well as she was able. In some respects little Jabez was a Godsend to her. The frequent attention he required, combined with her labours at the batting-frame and her household duties, tended to distract her mind from the dark picture over which she Avas so much inclined to brood, and to make her, if anything, more cheerful.

Soon after the memorable christening feast, Matthew Cooper and his family had removed \u2014 or \"flitted,\" as they called it \u2014 from Barlow's Yard to Skinners' Yard ; and Sally, that peaceable man's termagant wife, was not the most desirable of neighbours. The tea, and the currant-cake, and the beef, on that unusually well-spread board, had filled her with pleasure for the time, but turned to gall and bitterness ere they were digested. Why should the Cleggs be so high in the favour of Mr. and Madam Clough, and her Matt get nothing better than half-a-crown-piece ? He'd quite as much to do in saving the brat's life as Simon had, and, with such a family, wanted it a fine sight more. So"], [58, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 32 she argued and argued with herself, quite ignoring, or blind to the fact that it was not the mere impulse which saved, but the humanity which kept the babe, that Mr. Clough recognized, and never lost sight of. As Simon grew in favour at the tannery, the more excited grew Sally Cooper, until nothing Avould do but a removal to the opposite yard, Avhere she could see for herself the \" gooin's on o' them Cleggs;\" and once there, she contrived to harass Bess by numberless little spiteful acts, as Avell as by her vituperative tongue. Nor did little Jabez himself escape. Parson Brookes, grumbling loudly at every dowmvard step, found his way to Bess o' Sim's, guided by the quick-SAvishing, regular beat of the batting-wands. Mrs. Clough having, by ocular demonstration, satisfied herself that Bess was a sufficiently notable house-wife and a kindly nurse, had replaced the Avorn out long-clothes Avhich Jabez inherited from \" brother Joe,\" by a set of more serviceable and suitable short ones ; had, moreover, sent an embrocation to allay Simon's rheumatic pains, and to croAvn the whole, supplied a go-cart for the boy, to help him to walk, and yet leave the hands of industrious Bess at liberty. As Miss Jewsbury has said, in her exquisite story of \"The Rivals,\" that go-cart \"was the drop added to the brimming cup, the touch given to the falling column.\" Matt's Avorse-half\u2014 an inveterately clean woman, be it said \u2014 was occupied Avith her Saturday's \"redding up,\" when she satv the wood-turner carry it in ; and she thereupon trundled her mop at the door so vigorously and viciously, that the children instinctively shrank into corners, or ran out of the yard altogether, beyond reach of her weighty arm. And as, one by one, they ventured back, after what they thought a safe interval, creeping stealthily over the freshly-sanded floor, and mayhap leaving the"], [59, "The Manchester man. 33 impression of wet clogs thereon, jerks, cuffs, and slaps were administered Avith a freedom born of her supposed wrongs. When Mat came home, to offer his wages upon the household altar, the storm had not subsided, and he was fain to retreat to the quiet fireside of Simon to smoke his pipe in peace, and escape its pitiless peltings. He could not have selected a worse haven. It was a flagrant going over to the enemy. Thither she followed him in her wrath, and in her blind fury assailed not only him, but Bess, Simon, Mr. Clough, and Joshua Brookes, whom she mingled in indiscriminate confusion, casting aspersions on the girl, which wounded nobody more than her own husband. In the midst and in spite of all this, Jabez grew apace. Life was not altogether sweetened for him by Mrs. Clough's kindness, only made a little less bitter, and certainly not less hard ; since almost his first experience with the go-cart was to tilt at the open doorway, and pitch head-foremost down a flight of three steps into the stony yard, Avhence frightened Bess raised him, with a bleeding nose and a great lump on his forehead, amidst the mocking laughter of Sal Cooper. A chair Avas overturned across the doorway as a barrier, until Simon could place a sliding foot-board there. But Jabez had still many a knock against chair or table until Bess made a padded roll for his forehead, as a protective coronal. Then every tooth cost him a convulsion, and any one less patient and tender hearted than Bess would have abandoned her self-imposed charge in despair, his accidents and ailments made such inroads on her rest and on her time. But even patience has its limits, and Sally Cooper strained the cable until it snapped. At a war of words Bess was no match for her antagonist : and, rather than endure a second contest, the Cleggs left the fiery serpent behind, and quitted the yard. D"], [60, "34 the Manchester man. Not willingly, for Simon, contrary to the roving habits of ordinary Aveekly tenants, had not changed his abode since his wedding-day, and the river was as a friend to him. He declared he \" could na sleep o' neets without wayter singin' to him.\" However, he contrived to find a very similar tenement, in just such another cul-de-sac, with just such another tripe-dresser's cellar underneath, and that, too, without quitting Long Millgate. Midway betAveen the College and the tannery this court was situated, its narrow mouth opening to the breezes wafting dotvn Hanover Street ; they could still look out on the verdure of Walker's Croft, and the Irk laved its stony base as at that same Skinners' Yard, which Simon lived to see demolished. It was May ; bright, sunny, perfumed May. The hawthorn hedges on the ridge of the croft were white with scented blossoms, and the Irk \u2014 not the muddled stream which improve ment (?) is fast shutting out of remembrance \u2014 went on its dimpled way, smiling at the promise of the season. The echoes of the May-day milkcart bells, and the flutter of their decorative ribbons, were dying out of all but infantile remembrance \u2014 the month Avas more than a fortnight old. It was 1802, and Jabez Avas almost three years old. He was running, or rather scrambling, about the uneven court, gathering strength of limb and lung from their free use, albeit at the cost of dirt on frock and face, and the trouble of washing for Bess. She was singing at her batting-frame \u2014 not an unusual thing noAV, for rumour had Avhispered in her ear that the Lancashire Volunteers Avere on their homeward march. Even as she sang, a stout young fellow in uniform stopped at the narrow entrance of the court, and questioned two or three gossiping women, who, with arms akimbo, blocked up the passage, if they knew the Avhereabouts of Simon Clegg, the tanner, and his daughter Bess."], [61, ""], [62, ""], [63, "the Manchester man. 35 \" What ! th' wench as has the love-choilt ? \" answered one of the women. \"The girl I mean had no child Avhen I saw her last,\" responded he, betAveen his set teeth. \" Happen that's some toime sin', mester, or it's not th' same lass. That's her singin' like a throstle o'er her wark at the oppen winder.\" \"And that's her choilt,\" said another, ending by a lusty call, \" Jabez, lad, coom hither.\" Jabez, taught to obey his elders, came at a trot in answer to the woman's call. The volunteer looked down upon him. The child had neither Bess's eyes nor Bess's features ; but he heard the voice of Bess, and over the woman's shoulder he caught a glimpse of her face at the distant Avindow. It was Bess, sure enough ! Sick at heart, Tom Hulme, for it was he, leaned for support against the side of the dark entry. These Avomen but confirmed Avhat he had heard in Skinners' Yard from Matt Cooper's vindictive Avife. The deep shadow of the entry hid his change of countenance. Without a condemnatory word, without a step forward towards the girl Avhose heart was full of him, he steadied himself and his voice, and mustering courage to say, \" No, that is not the lass I want,\" strode resolutely out of the entry ; and, bending his steps to the right, turned up Toad Lane, and so on to the \" Seven Stars,\" in Withy Grove, where he was billeted. He had come back from Ireland full of hope, and this was the end of it ! He had been constant, and she Avas frail ! She Avhom he had left so pure had sunk so low that, though she bore the brand of shame, she could sing blithely at her work, unconscious or reckless of her degradation !

He might have doubted Sally Cooper's artful insinuations, but for the unconscious con firmation of the other women, and the personal testimony of poor little Jabez ; the innocent child, borne with sorrow by his own dead mother, bringing sorrow to his living maiden-foster mother. The little lispings of the child conveyed no impression to Bess's understanding, but one of the women bawled out to her from the open court \" Aw say, theer's bin a volunteer chap axin' fur a lass neamed Bess Clegg, but he saw thee from th' entry, and said yo're not th' lass he wanted ! \" Her heart gave a great leap, and the blood flushed up to her pale face. Could it be possible that there Avas another Bess Clegg of Avhom a volunteer could be in search ? Yet, had that been her Tom, he Avould have known his Bess again, even after five \u2014 ay, or twenty years. She would know him anyAvhere ! And so all that day, and the next, her heart kept in a flutter of expectation and perplexity. She wondered he did not come. The regiment was in tOAvn ; he surely had not been misled in his inquiries because they had \" flitted.\" Yet in all her thoughts the grim reality had no place. Her perfect innocence and singleness of heart had never suggested such a possibility to her. The days Avent by from the 13th to the 22nd, yet he came not. After working hours Simon tried to hunt him up ; but the billeting system and ill-lighted streets, set his simple tactics at defiance. On the latter day, Lord Wilton gave a dinner in the quadrangle of the College, to the non-commissioned officers and privates in his regiment, to celebrate their return, and the peace and plenty then restored to the land."], [65, "The Manchester Man. 37 At the first sound of fife and drum, Bess snatched up Jabez, and leaving house and batting-frame to take care of themselves, rushed along the street to the \" Sun Inn \" corner, Avhere Long Millgate turns at a sharp angle, the old Grammar School and the Chetham College gate standing at the outer bend of the elboAv. The better to see, she mounted the steps of the house next to the \"Sun\" \u2014 a house kept by a leather breeches maker, \u2014 and strained her eyes as the gay procession wound from the apple-market, passed the handsome black and-white frame-house of the Grammar School's head-master, and, with banners flying, and drums beating, marched under the ancient arched gateway between a double row of blue-coat boys. She held Jabez high up in her arms to let him see, and his little arms clasped her neck, as she scanned every passing soldier's features. Two-thirds of the corps had passed \u2014 she saw the loved and looked-for face, and, radiant with delight, stretched forward, and in eager tones called \u2014 \" Tom ! \" There was a mutual start at recognition; two faces crimsoned to the brow ; then one white as ashes, a keen meaning glance at the child, teeth clenched, and eyes set with stern resolution ; and, without another look, without a word, Tom Hulme went on under the Whale's-jawbone gateway ; and Bess, with brain bewildered, hands and limbs relaxed, sank on to the breeches maker's steps in a dead faint. A lady (Mrs. Chadwick), who had a little girl by the hand, caught Jabez as they fell, and putting his hand in her daughter's, bade her take care of him \u2014 she was perhaps a year or two older than he \u2014 whilst she raised the poor young woman's head, and applied a smelling-bottle to her nose.

OHE song of the human throstle was heard no more floating across the batting frame out of the window of its cage, in the dreary yard on the banks of the Irk. The swish of the wands might be heard when other sounds were low, but no more snatches of melody flowed in between. Kind-hearted Mrs. Chadwick had not been content to leave poor Bessy at the breeches-maker's when her swoon was over ; but, seeing that the girl continued in a dazed kind of stupor, sent to the adjoining \" Sun Inn \" for cold brandy-and-water, to stimulate the dormant mind. Bess drank, half unconsciously, and Mrs. Chadwick, leaving her little daughter Ellen to amuse astonished Jabez, waited patiently until the young woman could collect her ideas, and not only tell where she lived, but prepare to walk home. By that time the road was tolerably clear. Mrs. Chadwick thanked the breeches-maker, and bidding Miss Ellen march in advance with little Jabez, herself helped Bessy Clegg home ward. She never asked herself why or wherefore the girl had fainted, or whose the child she carried in her arms. She merely saw a * See Appendix."], [68, "The Manchester Man. 40 modest-looking young woman stricken down by illness or distress, and put out a Christian hand to help her. It was past Simon's dinner-hour, and they found him on the look-out for the absentees. He was more bewildered than Bess when he saw her brought home pale and trembling by a stranger, whose dress and manner bespoke her superior station, Mrs. Chadtvick explained, seeing that Bess was incapable. \"The poor girl fainted almost opposite to the College gate, as she Avatched Earl Wilton's regiment march past. She recovered so slowly, I was afraid to let her come through the streets unprotected, especially as she had so young a child in her charge.\" Simon thanked her, as Avell he might. Benevolence will relieve distress Avith money, or passing Avords of sympathy, but it is not often silken skirt and satin bonnet Avalk through a crowded thoroughfare in close conjunction Avith bonnetless cotton and linsey. Yet Simon Avas utterly at a loss to account for her swoon. He could only conjecture that she had missed her sweetheart from the corps, and that the enquiring volunteer had been a comrade sent to announce Tom Hulme's death. Observing how much he was confounded, the good lady thought it best to retire, and leave them to themselves. \" Come, Ellen, it is time we went home.\" But Ellen, seated on a low stool in the corner, had her lap full of broken toys, Avhich had found their way hither from the Clough nursery, and which Jabez displayed to all comers.\" \"My daughter appears Avonderfully attracted to your little grandson.\" \"He's noa gran'son o' moine, Missis, though aw think aw love th' little lad as much as if he did belung to us.

Aw dunnot know. Aw dunnot see mich credit i' doin' one's clear duty. But aAv think theer'd ha' bin accredit an' aw hadna done it.\" \" I wish everyone shared your sentiments,\" replied she. By this time the little girl had relinquished the toys, kissed the little boy patronisingly, and was by her mother's side, ready to depart. A word of sympathy and encouragement from Mrs. ChadAvick, and father and daughter were left alone with their new sorrow. Sorely puzzled was Simon to account for Tom Hulme's strange conduct. He could only come to the conclusion that he had picked up a fresh sweetheart in Ireland, and was ashamed to show his face. \"An\" if so, lass, yo're best off without him,\" said he. The stern, troubled look on the young volunteer's face, which Bess had seen and her father had not, he could not understand, and therefore could not credit. One day the girl said, as if struck by a sudden thought \"Feyther, aw saw Turn look hard at Jabez. D'un yo' think as heaw he fancied aw wur wed ? \" \" He moight, lass, he moight,\" said he, knocking the ashes out of his pipe; \"but dunnot thee fret, aAv'll look Turn up, and set it o' reet, if that's o'.\" But there Avas no setting it right, for by that time Tom had left the corps and the town, and thenceforth Bess's musical"], [72, "the Manchester man. 42 pipe was out of tune, and stopped utterly. She worked, it is true, but she had no heart in her work ; and though before her father she kept up a show of cheerfulness, in his absence she shed many and bitter tears. Smiles and tears are among a child's earliest perceptions and experiences. Of the mother's smile in its full sense Jabez knew nothing. With all her winning ways, Bess could never supply that want, if Avant it could be, where it was never missed, having so good a substitute. But of the change which came over her when she knew that Tom Avas indeed lost to her, even the three years' child could be sensible. He had been early taught to show a brave front when he hurt himself, and the starting tears would subdue to a whimper ; but, for all that, tears to him meant pain or disappointment, and as they fell and Avetted the (not always clean) little cheek laid lovingly against hers, a tender chord was struck ; he would press his small arm tighter round her neck, and with a sympathetic \" Don't ky, Beth ! \" nestle closer, and try to kiss away the drops, which only fell the faster. Low-spirited nurses do not make lively children, and Jabez, after a stout tussle with the whooping-cough, began to droop as much as Bess ; so clear-eyed Simon instituted a series of Sunday rambles for the three, in search of plants and posies, to brighten their dull home, and of bloom to brighten the fading cheeks. Sometimes Matt Cooper, with one or two of his youngsters, Avould join them, but not often, Sal was so jealous of his friendship with the Cleggs, and the pleasant day was so certain to be marred by an unpleasant reception in the evening at home. These summer walks seldom extended beyond Collyhurst Clough and quarries, or Smedley Vale, or through the fields to Cheetham Hill, stopping at the \"Cow and Calf\" to refresh, and"], [73, "The Manchester man. 43 rest the little ones, before they came back laden with wild flowers down Red Bank and over Scotland Bridge, to their respective \"yards\" in Long Millgate. At first, Avhenever they took the pleasant lower road through Angel Meadow, they did their best to ferret out the parentage and connections of Jabez, hoping by their inquiries even to keep alive the memory of his marvellous deliverance, so that in case the missing father should return, there might be a mutual restoration. These Sunday excursions did not drop with the sere autumnal leaves. A crisp clear day called them forth surely as sunshine had done, Jabez mounting pick-a-back on the shoulders of Simon or Matt when his little feet could no longer keep up their trot beside the bigger Cooper boys. Frames were invigorated, cheer fulness came back to face and home, and Simon, who had a deep-seated love of Nature in his soul, finding her so good a physician, kept up the acquaintance through rounding seasons and years. And from Nature he drew lessons which he dropped as seed into the boy's heart, as unconscious of the great Avork he was doing as was Jabez himself. The boy throve and greAv hardy. Companionship with older and rougher lads, sturdy fellows with wills of their own, made him sturdy too ; a lad who would take a bloAV and give one on occasion ; who would run a race and lose, and a second, and third, until he could Avin. But Bess's gentle training was something very different from Sal's, and Jabez grew up tender as well as strong and bold. A persecuted kitten had taken refuge under Bess's batting frame in the foundling's go-cart days, and in care for that kitten, and for a wounded broAvn linnet brought home one Sunday, he learned humanity. Matthew's lads were given to bird-nesting, and Matt himself saw no harm in it; but when"], [74, "The Manchester man. 44 that young linnet's Aving was broken in a scuffle for the nest stolen from a clump of brushwood, Simon read the robbers such a homily they had never heard in their young lives, and as a corollary he took the bird home to be fed and nursed by Bess and Jabez till it could fly, an event which never came about. In hot Aveather the lads pulled off clogs and stockings (there were no trousers to turn up \u2014 they wore breeches), and waded into pools and brooks, and Jabez would be no whit behind. On one of these occasions, either the current was too strong for the venturesome child, or the gravel slipped from under his feet, or his companions pushed him \u2014 no matter which, \u2014 but in he went, and, but for the presence of Simon, would have been droAvned. Simon had been born on the river banks, and could swim like a fish. At once he resolved that Jabez should learn to do the same, and begin at once. \" Yo' see, Bess, if aAv hadna bin theer he'd a bin dreawnded, sure as Avayter's wet, an' th' third toime pays off fur o' ; so he mun larn to tak' care on himsel' th' next toime he marlocks [gambols] among th' Jack-sharps.\" Jabez was not six years old when Simon Clegg gave him and the young Coopers their first lesson in swimming, in a delightful and sequestered part of Smedley Vale, where the Irk was clear and bright. He had shown them, nearer home, how a frog used its limbs, and then, after a few preliminary evolutions, to shoAv hoAv a man used his, took the lad on his back, and, after swimming with him awhile, shook him off into the water to flounder about for himself. Bess was often left at home on Sundays after that; and Jabez was not merely the better for his bath, but by the time he was eight years old was a fearless swimmer. Yet, although these country rambles had become an institution, Simon Clegg never neglected his Sabbath duties. Sunday morning"], [75, "The Manchester man. 45 was sure to see him, clean-shaven, in his best suit, with Jabez by the hand, and mild-eyed Bess beside, on the free seats of the Old Church, under the eye of parsons and churchwardens ; and Jabez, if he could understand little of the service, could gather in a sense of the beautiful from the grand old architecture, from the swell of the solemn organ, the harmonious voices of the choristers \u2014 of the Blue-coat boys in the Chetham gallery over the churchAvardens' pew, and of the Green-coat children farther on. Then the silver mace carried before the parson was a thing to wonder at, and fill him with awe ; and no one could tell how the clerical robes, and choristers' surplices, transfigured common mortals in his admiring eyes. Those years of Jabez Clegg's young life had been full of history for Manchester and Europe. The town had grown as Avell as the foundling. Invention had been busy. Volunteer regiments had been one by one disbanded, a daily newspaper was started, and peaceful arts flourished. Then, ere another year expired, Napoleon declared the British Isles in a state of blockade; British subjects on French soil, whether civil or military, to be prisoners of war; British commodities lawful spoil ; and so War \u2014 red-handed War \u2014 broke loose once more. Again Manchester rose up in arms to defend country and commerce. A \" Loyalty Fund \" of ,\u00a322,000 was raised for the support of Government. No fewer than nine separate volunteer corps sprang from the ashes of the old ones, and the town was one huge garrison. The commander of one regiment \u2014 the Loyal Masonic Rifle Volunteer Corps \u2014 Colonel Hanson \u2014 a remarkable man in many ways \u2014 was distinguished by a command from George III. to appear at Court in full regimentals, and with his hat on. Messrs. Pickford offered to place at the disposal of Government four hundred horses, fifty Avaggons, and t\\A'enty-eight boats. Loyal townsmen, with more money than courage of their own, sought to"], [76, "The Manchester Man. 46 stimulate that of others by sending gold medals flying amongst the officers of the volunteer corps. \"The British Volunteer\" came from the press of Harrop in the Market Place, and once more the music of drum and trumpet was in the ascendant. To crown the whole, Manchester, which had never been called upon to entertain British Royalty since Henry VII. looked in upon the infant town, was visited in 1804 by Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, commander of the North-west District, and his son, to revieAV this Lancashire volunteer army ; and the whole tOAvn was consequently in a ferment of excitement Nothing was thought of, or talked of, but the visit of the Duke and Prince, and the coming review, the more so as reports differed respecting the appointed site. Market Street, Manchester, which George Augustus Sala has commemorated as one of the \" Streets of the World,\" was then Market Street Lane, a confused medley of shops and private houses, varying from the low and rickety black-and-white tenement of no pretensions to the fine mansion with an imposing frontage, and ample space before. But the thoroughfare was in places so very narrow that two vehicles could not pass, and pedestrians on the footpath Avere compelled to take refuge in the doorways from the muddy Avheels which threatened damage to dainty garments, while the Avhole Avas ill-paved and worse lighted. At the corner where it opens a vent for the warehouse traffic of High Street, then stood a handsome new hotel, the Bridge water Arms, in front of which a semi-circular area was railed off with wooden posts and suspended chains. Within this area, on the bright morning of April the 12th, two sentinels were placed, Avho, marching backAvards and forAvards, crossed and recrossed each other in front of the hotel door ; tokens that the Royal Duke and his suite had taken up their quarters Avithin."], [77, "The Manchester man. 47 Beyond the semi-circle of chained posts, mounted horsemen kept back the concourse of spectators which pressed closely on the horses' heels. Among the crowd was Simon Clegg, with Jabez mounted on his shoulders, albeit he was a somewhat heavy load. Simon was a man of peace, but he was a staunch believer in Royalty, and that, quite as much as the spectacle, had drawn him thither. It was a mild and cheery April morn ; the AvindoAVS of the upper room in which sat the Prince, the centre of a brilliant circle, Avere open, and the loyal multitude feasted their un accustomed eyes with the sight. As Jabez looked on in a child's ravishment, a little dark-haired, dark-eyed girl, some six or seven years old, turned sharply round the narrow street by the side of the hotel on the flags where there Avas no chain to bar ; passing unquestioned the sentinel on guard, who, seeing only a Avell-dressed solitary child in white muslin, with a sash and hat-ribbons of pink satin, concluded that she belonged to the hotel. Once there, she asked fearlessly \u2014 \"Where is Prince William ? I want Prince William !\" Then the sentinel began to question ; but the little maid had but one reply \u2014 \" I want Prince William ! \" The soldier would have turned her back, but the disputation had attracted attention in the room above. An officer's head was thrust out, \"What's the matter?\" asked he. \" I want to see the Prince. I want to know \" ' Bid the little lady come up hither.\" And the little lady went up, all unconscious of state etiquette or ceremonial. An officer in rich uniform, with jeAvels on his breast, took her on his knee, and asked what she wanted with Prince William."], [78, "48 The Manchester Man. \" Oh, mamma and my aunts are wanting ever so to know if the review is going to be on Camp Field or on Sale Moor ; and Aunt Ellen says it's to be in one place, and mamma thinks it's the other ; and so, as I was dressed first, I just slipped out at the back door and ran here to ask Prince William himself, for I thought he would be sure to know. The gentleman laughed heartily, and the others followed suit. \" And Avho is your mamma, my dear ? \" \" My mamma is Mrs. Chadwick, and I'm Ellen Chadwick ; and we live in Oldham Street.\" \" Oh, indeed ! And why are the ladies so anxious to know Avhere the Prince holds the revieAv?\" asked the officer on whose knee she sat. \"Ah \u2014 that's just it. If he reviews at Sale Moor he will go past our house ; and then we shall see all the soldiers from our own windows.

She did not, however, lose sight of her self-imposed mission.

New Cross, where the volunteers assembled, was not then a misnomer. A market cross occupied the centre space between the four Avide thoroughfares, of which Oldham Street is one ; and the open area was considerable.

To-day, hoAvever, the royal party and the volunteers, many of whom had friends looking out for them, were the only prospect worth a thought ; and as they marched proudly on, to the gayest of gay tunes, kerchiefs Avaved, heads nodded, and eyes sparkled with delight and pleasure. As the Duke of Gloucester and his suite rode by, their charges prancing to the music, Ellen, mounted on a chair by the window, between Mrs. Ashton and her mother, suddenly pointed to an officer in their midst, resplendent with stars and orders, and In an ecstasy of delight screamed out \u2014 \" Mamma, mamma! that's the gentleman that gave me the shilling!\" The little treble voice pierced even through the clamorous music.

The momentary stoppage called forth a loud objurgation, as a reminder, from Sally Cooper, Avho was in advance with Matthew and such of her bigger lads as could step out; and Simon, equally anxious not to lose sight of the royal party, hurried on. But Sale Moor is beyond the confines of Lancashire, and Simon found the five miles stiff Avalking, Avith a child nearly six years old on his shoulders, and Master Jabez had to descend from his seat, and trudge on his own feet. This caused them to lag behind their friends, Sally insisting on Matt's keeping up with the soldiers, in order that they might get a good place on the Moor, and they Avere thus separated. Bess had remained at home. Never again could she look on marching troops without a pang, Sale Moor was alive Avith expectant sightseers. Stands and platforms had been erected for the accommodation of those who could afford and cared to pay ; there was a sprinkling of heavy carriages, and a crowd of carts, but the mass of spectators were on foot, vehicular locomotion being of very limited capacity. Of these latter were the Coopers and Cleggs, of course. Sally, Avith the elders of her turbulent brood, had reached the ground in time to be deafened by the score of cannon Lord Wilton's artillery fired as a salute to princedom. She had planted herself firmly against one of the supports of an elevated platform, Avhere the crowd of hero-worshippers Avas densest. She was tightly jammed and crushed against the woodwork ; but what matter ? she had a fine sight of the field, and as she watched the evolutions of the volunteers, congratulated herself and Matthew on having left \"that crawling Clegg an' the brat so far behint.\""], [83, "The Manchester man. 53 Almost as she spoke, there was a faint crackle, then another, and a yielding of the post against Avhich she leaned \u2014 a loud crash, a chorus of shrieks, half drowned by music and musketry, and the whole platform was down, with the living freight it had borne ; and she was down with it. The fashion, wealth, and beauty of Cheshire and South Lancashire had their representatives amongst that struggling swooning, writhing, shrieking, groaning mass of humanity, heaped and huddled in indiscriminate confusion, with up-torn seats, posts, and draperies. Strange to say, only one person was killed outright \u2014 that is, on the spot \u2014 for in its downfall the stand bore with it many of the throng beneath. But of the injured and the shaken, those who went to hospital and home to linger long and die at last, history has kept no record. Amongst these, this story tells of two \u2014 two differing in all but sex. Mrs. Aspinall, ever frail and delicate, was borne to her carriage with whole limbs, but insensible, her husband and their son Laurence both uninjured by her side. Physicians were in attendance, and never left her until she was safely lodged in her own luxurious chamber, overlooking ArdAvick Green, and could be pronounced out of immediate danger. Sally Cooper, with a sprained ancle, a dislocated shoulder, and many internal bruises, was placed in a light cart on a bed of straw procured from a neighbouring farm, with another of the injured, and carried to the Manchester Infirmary, to try the skill and the patience of the doctors and nurses. Neither recovered. The unwounded lady, sorely shaken, succumbed to the shock her nervous system had received ; and Master Laurence, already petted and wilful, was left to be still further spoiled by his widowed father and Kitty, his mother's old nurse. Sally, strong of frame and will, impatient of pain and of restraint, Avas restive under the surgeons'"], [84, "The Manchester Man. 54 hands, and defeated their efforts to ascertain her injuries. She exhausted herself with shrieks and cries, tossed about and disturbed bandages, rejected physic, which she called \"poison,\" and soon put her case beyond the cure of physicians. Too late she became sensible of her own folly. Then, when recovery was impossible, she repented of many misdeeds, and of none more than her slander of poor Bess. And thus it tvas. When the mother was taken from the head of Cooper's home, Bess's kind heart yearned to help the disconsolate man and his troop of children. Fortunately, the eldest was a girl of sixteen, and there was a younger girl of ten. Both of these had gone out to work, but now Molly had to stay at home and try to keep all right and tight there. And here Bess came to her aid. Without scolding or brawling, she put the girl into the way of doing things quickly and quietly. She encouraged her to persevere, so that her cleanly mother should detect no eyesores when she came home restored. She tried to persuade the boys to be less refractory \u2014 to help, not to irritate, their sister ; and somehoAV Cooper's home began to miss Sail, much as one misses a whirhvind. The kindness of Bess o' Sim's was duly reported to the Infirmary patient, and at first chafed her sorely. She \" hated to be under obligations, and to that lass o' a' others.\" But Bess, leaving her own work \u2014 and the loss of an hour meant the loss of an hour's earnings \u2014 herself Avent to see Sally ; and such was the influence of her gentle voice and touch, that Sally's chagrin imperceptibly wore away. Towards the last she grew delirious, raved of Bess and Tom Hulme and forgiveness, and in the short calm preceding dissolution, confessed to Matt Cooper and the attendant nurse that she had cast a slur on Bess Clegg's good name. Had made Tom Hulme believe that Simon had taken the lass from Skinners' Yard to"], [85, ""], [86, ""], [87, "The Manchester Man. 55 hide her shame. That everybody in the yard knew that Bess had a child. And that she had bade him inquire for himself. And almost her last word was a hope that Bess would forgive her. Matthew Cooper himself hardly forgave his dead wife. How, therefore, should he carry this confession to Bess, and ask her to forgive ? He took a medium course ; and after a few days' consideration, while they and the rest of the tanners were eating their \" baggin \" (a workman's luncheon, so called from the bag it is, or was, usually carried in), sat down beside Simon on a bundle of thick leather, and told him as well as he was able. Simon was troubled ; but he was not vindictive. He would have been less than a man had he not been bitter against the cruel woman who had causelessly wrecked his good daughter's life. But he was sorry for Matt, and broke out into no revilings. The woman was dead. The ill she had done had been fearfully punished, and neither curses nor reproaches could affect her or undo the mischief. He left his cheese and jannock on the hides untasted, drew his hand across his forehead, and went down to the river-side and across the wooden bridge for a breath of fresh air and a waft of fresh thought. He was only a rugged tanner, but he had a heart within his breast ; he had a daughter on his hearth with a great wound in her heart, a blast on her good name, and he Avas called upon to forgive the author of this mischief ! Simon had long been used to commune with his own heart. He had built up a wall round it with the leaves of that one book on his bureau ; and whenever he was in doubt or difficulty, he read the precepts inscribed upon that wall. He went back to Cooper, whose appetite had been no better than his own. \"Aw mun think this ower, Matt. Aw connot say aAv furgive yo'r Sail o' at a dash. Hoo's done that as may niver be undone"], [88, "The Manchester Man. 56 whoile thee an' me's alive; an' aw connot frame to say as aw furgive her loike o' on a sudden. An' aw mun think it ower before eaAvt be said to eawr Bess, poor wench ! \" A week elapsed before the subject Avas broached again. Then Simon spoke to Matthew as they were leaving the tannery-yard. \"Coom into th' 'Queen Anne'\" (he called it quean), \"Matt, and have a gill ; aAv've summat t' say to thee.\" There Avas nobody in the taproom. They sat down to their half-pint horns of ale \u2014 times were too hard to afford deeper draughts \u2014 and Simon said : \"AAv've bin thinkin' o' this Aveek, an' as aAv connot furgive yo'r Sail, gradely loike, aw'll no put th' same temptation i' th' way of eawr Bess. Hoo'd better think Turn's takken oop wi' some other wench, than ha' th' shame o' knowin' th' lad's toorned her up i' disgrace.

But Simon had not said all his say. \" But aw'm not gooin' to sit deaAvn Avi' my honds i' mi' lap, an' that great lump o' dirty slutch stickin' to moi lass.

There was a christening party in Mosley Street, at the Ashtons', at which not only the Chadwicks, but the Rev. Joshua Brookes \u2014 who had that day named the infant Augusta \u2014 were present. They had selected a public occasion for their private festival. It was a grand affair. Mr. Ashton Avas a small-ware manufacturer in an extensive Avay of business, his house and warehouse occupying a large block of buildings at the corner of York Street. And the baby Augusta, born the previous month, was a first child, his wife being younger than himself considerably. Miss Ellen, too, Avas there, her wonderful shilling, through which a hole had been drilled, suspended from her neck like an amulet. Simon and Matt had given up their holiday to fruitless inquiries after Tom Hulme ; and Jabez, after a stand-up fight with a boy in the yard in defence of his kitten, had come to have his bleeding nose and bruised forehead doctored by Bess, who shed over him the tears long gathering in their fountains for Tom Hulme's defection And somehow at that stylish christening feast, where the baby Augusta was a personage of importance almost as great as the celebrated Miss Kilmansegg, the orphan Jabez and his fosterers came on the table for discussion along with the dessert ; Mrs. Chadwick, Mr. Clough, and Joshua Brookes concurring in the opinion mooted by the lady that something should be done to relieve the worthy tanner and his daughter of the cost and trouble of main taining the boy as he grew older and would want educating. That they should talk of the cost of maintenance when bread was a shilling a loaf, was no marvel; but that \"education\" should be named as a necessity for one of \" nobody's children,\" can only be cited as a proof that either the boy's strange introduction to Manchester, or Simon's strange generosity, had excited an interest in both beyond the common run."], [90, "58 The Manchester Man.

She was active and * See Appendix."], [92, "60 The Manchester Man. energetic, and expected those around her to be the same. Yet she was kind to them, as may be supposed, for she gave every Sunday a good dinner to fourteen old men and women on whom fortune had looked unkindly, waiting upon them herself, and never tasting her own dinner until her pensioners had dined. Regular in her own attendance at the old Church, she required her household to be regular too, though she left them little enough time to dress \u2014 possibly because her own toilette was so scant. The dress in which she presented herself at church was certainly unique for a woman of wealth. Her gown of sober stuff was well worn ; a mob-cap (a fashion which came in with the French Revolution) adorned her head, over Avhich, by way of bonnet, a brown silk handkerchief Avas tied. On rare \u2014 very rare \u2014 occasions, an old black silk bonnet covered all. Joshua Brookes, at odds with his clerical brethren, with his pupils, and half the world besides, was on good terms with Mrs. CloAves. Rough, prompt, and uncompromising Avas she ; rough, irritable and unmannerly was he ; both unpromising hard husked nuts, with sweet and tender kernels. So rough, few ever suspected the soft heart ; yet the woman who fed the poor before herself, and the learned clergyman who had a fancy for pigeons, and who cherished the drunken and abusive old crippled shoemaker, his father, to the last, must have intuitively known the inner life of each other. The day following Augusta Ashton's christening, it fell within the round of the Reverend Joshua's duty to read the burial service over a dead townswoman in the churchyard. And now occurred one of those incidents in which the ludicrous and the profane blended, and brought impulsive Joshua into disfavour. As was not unfrequently the case, he broke off in the midst of the service, left the mourners and the coffin beside the open"], [93, "The Manchester man. 61 grave, threw his legs over the low wall, and, mounting the steps into the confectioner's shop, said: \"Here, quick, dame? Give me some horehound drops for my cough.\" On his entrance Mrs. Clowes broke off a narrative over which she and her shopwoman were laughing heartily, in order to reach the required drops, which went into a paper Avithout weighing, and for which no payment was tendered. Back he strode over the churchyard wall to resume the interrupted ceremonial. It must here be observed that Joshua had remarkably shaggy eyebrows, overhanging his quick eyes like pent-houses, and that it Avas the wont of the schoolboys and others to annoy him by drawing their fingers significantly over their own. A young sweep sat upon the churchyard wall to witness the funeral, and \u2014 young imp of Satan that he was ! \u2014 he could not forbear drawing a thumb and forefinger over each brow, full in Joshua's sight, just as he reached the passage \u2014 \" I heard a voice from heaven saying \" The shaggy eyebrows contracted ; he roared out \u2014 \" Knock that little black rascal off the church wall ! The mischievous little blackamoor was off, with a beadle after him ; and the eccentric chaplain, whom no sense of irreverence seemed to strike, concluded the ceremony with no further interruption. At its close, Mr. Aspinall and another mourner took the clergyman to task for his disrespect to the remains of the deceased Mrs. Aspinall, Avhose obsequies had been so irregularly performed. They said nothing of disrespect to the Divinity profaned ; their OAvn feelings and importance had been outraged, and they forgot all else even by the dust and ashes in the gaping grave ; and little Laurence, cloaked and hooded, forgot his grief in Avatching the chase after the sweep."], [94, "62 The Manchester Man. \" Hoav dare you, sir, give way to these indecencies at the funeral of my wife ? It has been most indecorous and insulting, both to the dead and her afflicted relatives.\" \"She's had Christian burial, hasn't she?\" gruffly interrogated Joshua. \" Hardly,\" was the hesitating answer. \" She's been laid in consecrated ground, and I've read the burial service over her ; what more would you have ? Some folk are never satisfied.\" Emptying half his horehound drops into the hand of Master Laurence, Joshua turned on his heel, went to the chapter-house to disrobe, and then back over the wall to Mrs. Clowes. \" I say, dame, you were not at church on Sunday.\" No, Parson Brookes ; I was in Liverpool.\" Oh!\" grunted he, \"in Liverpool. Sugar-buying, I suppose?\" 'Yea; an' a fine joke I've had.\" ;' Joshua pricked up his ears ; he did not object to a little fun. \" You mun know I thought I'd give Branker, the new sugar broker, a trial, an' I went there an' asked to see samples ; but the young whipper-snapper of a salesman looked at me from top to toe, an', I suppose, reckoned up the value of my old black bonnet, my kerchief an' mutch, an' my old stuff dress, and fancied my pockets must match my gown, for he was barely civil, and didn't seem to care for the trouble o' showin' th' samples.

Give me quarter-a-pound of humbugs ; I threw half the other things away,\" said he. \" I don't think it's much you'll throw away, Jotty,\" replied the old confectioner, Avith independent familiarity, as she weighed and parcelled the sweets, for which this time he put down the money. \" It's much you know about it, Mother Clowes,\" he jerked out, as if throwing the words at her over his shoulder, as he turned to leave the shop, putting the package in one of the large pockets of his long flap waistcoat as he went. His own house, not more than three hundred yards aAvay, adjoined the Grammar School, a red brick building, with stone quoins, now darkened by time and smoke, one gable of which overhung the Irk ; the other, pierced for four small-paned windows, almost confronting the antique Sun Inn, at the acute angle of Long Millgate, and quite overlooking an open space, flanked by the main entrance to the College. From this, the east wing of the College, it is separated by a plain iron gateway and palisades on the Millgate side, and by a low Avail Avhich serves as a screen from the river on the other side ; the enclosed space between rails, wall, College, and the front of the school serving as a playground for such scholars as were willing to keep within bounds. It was divided into upper, middle, and loAver schools, the last being in the basement, and designed for elementary"], [96, "64 The Manchester man. instruction. The high and middle schools together occupied the same long room above this. Joshua Brookes, as second master, presided over the middle school, and surely neyer M.A. had so thankless an office. He was placed at a terrible disadvantage in the school, not altogether because he had risen from its loAvest ranks \u2014 not altogether because a drunken, foul-mouthed cripple interfered with their sports, or went reeling to his son's domicile next door \u2014 not because he was unduly severe ; other masters were that \u2014 but because his own eager thirst for knowledge as a boy had made him intolerant towards indolence, incredulous of incapacity ; and his constitutional impatience and irritability made his harsh voice seem harsher when he reproved a dullard. He lost his self-command, and with that went his command over others. Meaning to be affable to the poor, from whose ranks he sprang, he became familiar ; and they reciprocated the familiarity so fully as to draw down the contempt of his confreres. He was a man to be respected, and they slighted him ; a man to be honoured, and they snubbed him. What Avonder, then, that eccentricities grew like barnacles on a ship's keel, or that the boys failed in obedience and respect to a master when their elders set them the example ? This defence of a misunderstood man has not taken up a tithe of the time he gave to his refractory class, to whom he went straightway from the confectioner's, whose \"humbugs\" had melted considerably, not wholly down his own throat, before the hour when the boys closed their Latin Grammars and Greek Lexicons, and poured as if they were mad down the steps, and through the gate, to the road. Yet even the sweets he gave to the attentive did not conciliate ; they only made the intractable more defiant ; and the recipients felt they were bribed. Warned by the uproar of a large school in motion, as well as by the long-cased clock, Tabitha, his one servant, had her"], [97, "The Manchester Man. 65 master's tea ready for him the instant he came in from the school, '-as he generally did, fagged and jaded, with the growl of a baited bear. That day he simply put his head into the house, and bawled, \" Tea ready, Tab ? \" and without waiting for an answer, went on, \" Keep it hot till I get back ; \" then, closing the door, took his way eastwards down Long Millgate. His journey was not a long one. It ended at the bottom of a yard where a sad, pale-faced young woman was switching monotonously at a mass of downy cotton, and listening at the same time to the equally monotonous drawl of a youngster in the throes of monosyllabic reading. \" Get laming, lad ! \u2014 get laming !

Good boys don't fight.\" \" Then what did Bill Barnes throw stones at ar pussy for ? Good boys dunnot hurt kittlins,\" said Jabez, nothing daunted. Bess explained. \" Um ! \" quoth Joshua, when she had finished, \" he's fond of his kitten, is he ? \" and drawing Jabez towards him by the shoulder, with one finger uplifted as a caution, he looked down on the shrinking child, and said, impressively \u2014 \" Never fight if you can help it, Jabez ; but if you fight to save a poor dumb animal from ill-usage, or to protect the weak against F"], [98, "The Manchester Man. 66 the strong, Jotty Brucks is not the man to blame you. Here, lad,\" and into the pinafore of Jabez went the remainder of the \"humbugs.\" He patted the boy on the head, bade him get on with his reading, he did not know what good fortune might come of it, told him to come regularly to church, to love God and God's creatures, and went away, leaving Bess to prepare her father's porridge (tea was from twelve to sixteen shillings a pound, and beyond their reach). Almost on the threshold he encountered Simon. \"Can't you keep that young sprig out of mischief? If he begins fighting and quarrelling at six years old, what will he do when he is sixteen?\" he cried, gruffly, as he brushed past the tanner, and was far up the yard before the man could think of a reply. A couple of young pigeons were sent for Jabez about a week after, with a large bag of stale cakes and bread to feed them with. The name of the sender was unknown, but anyone acquainted Avith the habits of Joshua Brookes (who contracted for Mrs. Clowes' waste pastry, to fill the crops of his own feathered colony) would not have been troubled to guess. Simon stroked his raspy chin, and seemed dubious, cost of keep being a question ; but Jabez looked so wistful, his foster father borrowed tools and answered the appeal by making a triangular cote for them, and Jabez found fresh occupation in their care. Yet occupation was not lacking, young as he was. He could fetch and carry, run short errands, and help Bess to clean. Their living-room no longer waited a week to be swept and dusted, Jabez did it every day, standing on a chair to reach the top of the bureau, where lay the cynosure of his young eyes.

It is needless to grope upward from the time when the Saxon Theyn built a fortified residence on its site ; sufficient for us that Thomas de la Warr, youngest son of the feudal baron of Manchester, was brought up to the Church, and in the fourteenth century inducted into the Rectory of Manchester, his father being patron. His elder brother dying at the close of the century, the rector (a pious Churchman) became baron. And then he put his power and wealth to sacerdotal uses. He petitioned the king, obtained a grant to collegiate Christ Church, erected the College, endowed it with lands ; and here at his death the Warden of the Collegiate Church had his residence. Of these wardens, the celebrated Dr. Dee, whose explorations into alchemy"], [102, "The Manchester Man. 70 and other occult sciences brought him into trouble with Queen Elizabeth, was one ; and Dr. Dee's room is still extant\u2014 in occupation of the governor.

He had interested both Mr. and Mrs. Clough in the election of the foundling, and where the influence of the gentleman failed, that of the lady prevailed ; so that when the important Easter Monday arrived, two-thirds of the feoffees were fully acquainted with his peculiar case, and more or less impressed in his favour. It was on the 18th of April, bright, sunny, joyous. Compared with its present proportions, Manchester then was but as a cameo brooch on a mantle of green ; and that green was already starred with daisies, buttercups, primroses, and cowslips. By wells and brooks, daffodil and jonquil hung their heads and breathed out perfume. Bush and tree put out pale buds and fans of promise. The tit-lark sang, the cuckoo \u2014 to use a village phrase \u2014 had \" eaten up the mud ; \" and the town was alive with holiday makers from all the country round about. It was the great College anniversary, not only election day, but one set apart for friends to visit Blue-coat boys already on the found ation, and for the curious public to inspect the Chetham Museum. The main entrance in Millgate (said to be arched with the jaw-bone of a whale) and the smaller gate on Hunt's Bank, were both thrown open. A stream of people of all grades, in festival array, poured in and out, and College cap and gown seemed to be ubiquitous. The pale, sad widow or widower, holding an orphan boy by the trembling hand, the uncle or next of kin to the doubly orphaned candidate, were there, standing in a long line ranged against the building, and representing hopes and fears and eventualities little heeded by the shifting stream of gazers."], [106, "The Manchester Man. 72 For the previous Aveek Mrs. Clowes and her assistants had been working night and day; her shop was in a state of siege. Every boy, and every boy's friend, seemed to have pocket-money to spend, and to Avant to spend it over her counter. Then it was the great Avedding-day of the year, and the churchyard swarmed like a hive ; from every one of the many public-houses round College and Church, music and mirth, clattering feet, and loud voiced laughter issued. \"The Apple Tree,\" \"The Pack Horse,\" \"The Ring o' Bells,\" \"The Blackamoor's Head,\" were filled to repletion Avith Avedding guests ; whilst \" The College Inn \" and the old \" Sun Inn \" held a less boisterous quota of the Collegians' friends and relatives. On those wet days when outdoor play was impossible, the boys, besides darning their stockings, occupied their spare hours in carving spoons and apple-scrapers out of bone, in working balls and pincushions in fanciful devices with coloured worsted, and a stitch locally known as \"colleging;\" and with these, on Easter Monday and at Whitsuntide, they reaped a harvest of pocket-money, having liberty to offer them for sale. And when it is remembered that our notable female ancestors, poor and rich, wore indoors a pincushion and sheathed scissors suspended at their sides, it is not to be wondered that these found ready purchasers as memorials of the visit. But in that College Yard were anxious and expectant as well as buoyant faces. And there in that line, waiting to be called when their turn came, stood Jabez between Simon Clegg and Bess, Avith Matthew and the nurse on either hand. And ever and anon their eyes went up to the oriel window which faced the main entrance, for in the room it lighted the arbiters of the boy's destiny sat in judgment on some other orphan's claim.

They found that he could read a little, knew part of his catechism, and they saw that he was a well behaved, intelligent boy, with truthful dark grey eyes and a reflective brow. There was a long and animated discussion, during which the boy and his friends were bidden to retire. It was contended that the marriage of the boy's parents was not proven \u2014 that his very name was dubious, \u2014 and that the founder's will was specific on that head. Then one of Mrs. Clough's friends rose and grew eloquent. He asked if they were to interpret the will of the great and benevolent man, whose portrait looked doAvn upon them, by the spirit or by the letter? If they themselves did not feel that the boy was eligible, as the nurse's testimony went to prove ? That this was a case peculiarly marked out for their charitable construction. And he wound up by inquiring if they thought Humphrey Chetham would expect his representatives to be less humane, less charitable, less conscientious in dealing with a bounty not their own, than that poor struggling, hard-working tanner and his daughter, who had maintained and cherished the orphan in spite of cruelly hard times, and still more cruel slander.

Then there were his playmates in the yard, with liberty to run in and out at will ; and lastly, there were his dumb pets \u2014 his kitten (grown to a cat), his pigeons, and the lame linnet, hopping from perch to finger, and paying him for his love with the sweetest of songs. He was not more stunned by the noise and Easter Monday bustle in the College Yard, or more awed by the imposing presence of Governor Terry and the feoffees, than by the magnitude, order, and antique grandeur of the building henceforth to be his home. Nevertheless, wide open as the gates were for the day, he felt that they would close, and shut him in among the cold strong walls and strangers, never to see his pets or his loving friends again until Whitsuntide should bring another holiday. They older, more experienced, with a better knowledge of all the boy would gain \u2014 all the privation and premature labour he would escape \u2014 felt only how dull their humble home would be without the willing feet and hands, the smiling face, and the cheerful voice of the sturdy little fellow who for more than seven years had been as their own child."], [114, "78 The Manchester Man. He had given his last charge respecting his furry and feathered brood, exchanged the last clinging embrace under the dark arch, then tore aAvay in quest of a deserted corner, where he could hide the tears he could not wholly restrain. At first the new dress of which he was so proud, the yellow stockings and clasped shoes in place of clogs, the yellow baize petticoat, the long-skirted blue overcoat or gown, the blue muffin-cap, the white clerical band at the throat (all neat, and fresh, and unpatched as they were), felt awkward and uncomfortable \u2014 the long petticoat especially incommoded him. But in a few days this wore off. There were other lads equally strange and unaccustomed to robes and rules. Fellow-feeling drew them towards each other, and with the wonderful adaptability of childhood, they fell into the regular grooves, and were as much at home as the eldest there in less than a fortnight. And from the Chetham Gallery in the Old Church he could see and be seen by Simon and Bess on Sabbath mornings from the free seats in the aisle, and that contented them. The training and education of the Chetham College boys was, and is, conducted on principles best adapted for boys expected to fight their way upwards in the world. They were not encumbered with a number of \"ologies\" and \"isms\" (the highest education did not stand on a par then with the moderate ones of this day) ; their range of books and studies was limited. Reading, writing, and arithmetic, sound and practical information alone were imparted, so much as was needed to fit the dullest for an ordinary tradesman, and supply the persevering and intelligent with a fulcrum and a lever. Nor did their education end Avith their lessons in the schoolroom, nor was it drawn from books and slates alone. Their meals were regular, their diet pure and ample, but plain. They rose at six, began the day with prayer, and retired"], [115, "The Manchester Man. 79 to rest at eight. Besides their duties in the schoolroom, they darned their own stockings, made their own beds, helped the servants to keep their rooms clean, and six of the elder boys were set apart to run errands and carry messages beyond the precincts of the College. Strength of muscle and limb were gained in the open courtyard in such games as trap and football ; patience and ingenuity had scope in the bead purses, the carved apple-scoops and marrow spoons, the worsted balls and pincushions they made to fill their leisure hours indoors. There was no idleness. Their very play had its purpose. Let us set Jabez Clegg under the kind guardianship of Christopher Terry, the Governor, and under the direct supervision of the Reverend John Gresswell, the schoolmaster, to con his Mavor, and make pothooks-and-ladles, on a form in the large schoolroom at the east end of the College, and to rise, step by step, up the first difficult rungs of that long ladder of learning which may indeed rest on our common earth, but which reaches far above the clouds and human ken. Christmas and Midsummer vacations came and went, so did those red-letter days of his College life, Easter and Whitsuntide, when he was free to rush to the old yard, so near at hand, and after hugging Bess and Simon, whom he astonished with his learning, could assure himself his dumb family had been Avell cared for. And if those passing seasons traced deeper lines on Simon's brow, gave more womanly solidity to Bess's form and character, they brought no change the foundling could mark. Tom Hulme's whereabouts was still undiscovered. Matt Cooper was still a widower. But they and his masters could note the steady progress he made, and his chivalrous love of truth and sense of honour shown in many Avays in little things. Yet there was one event a"], [116, "80 The Manchester Man grief to him. His little brown linnet pined for its young friend, and died before the first Whitsunday came. He was not much over ten years old Avhen he was proved to possess courage, as well as truth and honour. For some time Nancy, the cook, had observed that the cream was skimmed surreptitiously from the milk-pans in the dairy, that the milk itself was regularly abstracted, and she was loud in complaint. She could scarcely find cream enough to set on the governor's table, and servants and schoolboys Avere in turn accused of being the depredators. Complaints were made to Mr. Terry, servants and boys Avere alike interrogated and Avatched, and punished on suspicion, but nothing could be proved, and no precautions could save the milk. The lofty and spacious kitchen had its entrance almost under the porch, and close beside it was a flight of stone steps leading to the dairy, a cellar below the kitchen, lit by a small window high up on the side towards the river, and of course opposite to the steps. Stone tables occupied the two other sides, on which were ranged a number of Avide, shallow pans of good milk. In the extreme corner, at right angles with the door at the head of the stairs, was another entrance, a small oaken door in a Gothic frame, which opened on another and shorter flight of steps, cut in the rock and Avashed by the river, which sometimes rose and beat against the cellar-door for admission, beat so oft and importunately as to wear away the oak where it met the floor. It was nearly breakfast time. Long rows of wooden bowls and trenchers were ranged on the white kitchen-table. The oatmeal porridge was ready to pour out. The cook ran short of milk. Through a Avindow overlooking the yard she espied Jabez, Avhip in hand, driving a biped team of play-horses. \"Jabez, Jabez Clegg!\" she called out at the pitch of her A'oice, \" come hither.\""], [117, ""], [118, "h to O X *?-\u25a0 < X h W X u es < 1-1 \u25baJ w u Cil S! z"], [119, "The Manchester Man. 81 Down went the reins, and the prancing steeds proceeded without a driver. \" Fetch a can of milk from the cellar, Jabez ; an' look sharp, An' see as yo' dunna drink none!\" \"I never do,\" said Jabez, not overpleased at the imputation. \"Well, see as yo' don't, for some on yo' do.\" Jabez took the bright tin can, without putting down the whip, and descended the unguarded cellar-stairs, whistling as he went. He gave a jump down the last feAV steps, and to his utter surprise, I cannot say dismay, saAV that he had disturbed a great greenish-brown snake, spotted with black and having a yelloAvish ring round its neck. It lay coiled on the stone table opposite to him, and with its head elevated above the rim of a milk-pan, Avas taking its morning draught, and in so doing reckoning Avithout its host. \"Oh! you're the thief, are you, Mr. Snake? It's you've robbed us of our milk, and got us boys thrashed for it!\" cried Jabez, without a thought of danger, planting himself between the culprit and the small postern door, as the snake, gliding from the slab, turned thither for exit, putting out its forked tongue and hissing at him as it came. Without thought or consideration \u2014 Avithout a cry of alarm to those above, he struck at the threatening foe Avith his Avhip ; and as the resentful snake darted at him, jumped nimbly aside, and struck and struck again ; and as the angry snake writhed and twisted, and again and again darted its frightful head at him with distended jaws, he whipped and whipped away as though a top and not a formidable reptile had been before him. Cook, out of patience, called \"Jabez Clegg!\" more than once, in anything but satisfactory tones ; and then, patience exhausted, came to the top of the dairy stairs. Then she heard Jabez, as if addressing some one, say : '\u2022 Oh ! you would, would G"], [120, "The Manchester Man. 82 you?\" and the commotion having drawn her so far down the steps that she could peer into the cellar and see what Avas going on, she set up a prolonged scream. This was just as Jabez, shifting the position of his Avhip, brought the butt-end down on the head of the snake with all the force of his stout young arm, and his exhausted foe dropped, literally whipped to death. The woman's screams brought not only the governor and the school-master, but Dr. Stone, the librarian, to the spot. And there stood Jabez, all his proAvess gone, Avith his back towards them, his head down on his arms, Avhich rested on the stone slab, sobbing violently for the very life he had just destroyed. \" Oh, he's bin bitten \u2014 he's bin bitten ! The vemonous thing's bitten the lad 1 He'll die after it!\" cried the cook in an ecstasy of terror. \" Stand aside, Nancy,\" said Dr. Stone ; \" that snake is not venomous. If I mistake not, the brave boy's heart is wounded, not his skin.\" And, coming down, the kind, discerning librarian lifted the snake with the one hand, and took hold of Jabez Avith the other, simply saying to him \u2014 \"Come into the governor's room, Jabez, and tell us all about it.\" And Jabez, drying his red eyes on the cuff of his coat, was ushered before the Doctor up the stairs, and into the governor's room, where breakfast was laid for the three gentlemen. There he briefly told hoAv he had found the snake drinking the milk ; and having intercepted the reptile's retreat, had been obliged, in self defence, to fight with it until he had Avhipped it to death \u2014 a consummation as unlooked for as regretted. He had not, as at first surmised, escaped unAvounded in the contest ; but, as Dr. Stone had said, and the surgeon who dressed the bites confirmed, the terrible-looking reptile was but the common"], [121, "Thb Manchester Man. 83 ringed-snake, which takes freely to the water ; and its bite was harmless. From the dais in the refectory both snake and whip were exhibited to the boys after breakfast. \" My lads,\" said the governor, \" I daresay you will all be glad to knoAv that the thief Avho stole the milk has been taken.\" There was a general shout of assent, Avith here and there a wondering glance at the vacant seat of Jabez, who, having his wounds Avashed and bound up, had not sat down with them, but had a sort of complimentary breakfast with the servants in the kitchen. \"And I daresay you would like to see the thief, and know how he was caught.\" There Avas another general \" Ay, ay, sir ! \"Well, here he is\" (and he held the snake aloft); \"but I don't think any of you will be thrashed on his account again. Jabez Clegg, here \" (and he pulled the reluctant boy forward by the shoulder), \" caught the sly robber drinking the milk, and, with nothing but this Avhip and a fearless, resolute arm, put a stop to his depredations, and restored the lost character of the school.\" There was a loud hurrah for Jabez Clegg, who for the time being was a hero. Then, the snake being carried to the schoolroom, the Rev. John Gresswell improved the occasion by a lesson on snakes in general, and that one in particular. But when he dissipated the popular belief that all snakes were venomous, and assured the boys that the bite of this was innocuous, more than one of the Blue-coated lads thought Jabez was not such a hero after all. The heads of the College thought otherwise. The snake, and whip also, were placed high up against a wall in the College museum, close beside the \" woman's clog which was split by a thunderbolt, and hoo wasn't hurt.\" They made part of the"], [122, "The Manchester Man. 84 catalogue of the Blue-coat guides \u2014 nay, even Jabez may have run the rapid chronicle from the reel himself; but the pain and shock of having wilfully killed a living creature neutralised and prevented the harm which might have followed self glorification. The long unknown secret spoiler of the dairy had been such a blemish on the spotless character of the Chetham Hospital \u2014 such a scandal in its little world \u2014 that its capture became of sufficient importance for Dr. Thomas Stone to communicate to the Reverend Joshua Brookes on his next visit to the library, Jabez being considered a sort of prottgt of his. Before the day was out the parson found his cough troublesome, and, of course, went to Mrs. Clowes for horehound-drops. \" Well, what do you think of young Cheat-the-fishes now ? \" came raspily from his lips, as he leaned on the counter, evidently prepared for a gossip, shop-chairs being unheard-of superfluities in those days. Mrs. Clowes knew perfectly well whom the parson meant by \" young Cheat-the-fishes \" ; indeed, the boy, on his rare holidays, had been a customer, as were the boys of College and Grammar School generally. \"Now? Why, what's th' lad been doing? Naught wrong, I reckon ? \" You see she had faith in the boy's open countenance, \" Humph ! that's as folk think,\" he growled, keeping his own opinion to himself. \" I don't suppose I need to tell you the hubbub there's been over there\" (jerking his finger in the direction of the College) \"about the stolen milk? That tale's old enough.\" Mrs. Clowes nodded her mob-cap in assent. \"Well, that lad Jabez found a snake, four feet long, with its head in the milk pans the other morning. The sly thief"], [123, "The Manchester Man. 85 turned spiteful, and the two had a battle-royal all to themselves in the cellar. The pugnacious rapscallion had a whip in his hand, and he \u2014 lashed the snake to death ! \" Mrs. Clowes echoed his last words, and uplifted her hands in amazement. A snake Avas a terrible reptile to her. \" Ah ! and then blubbered like a cry-a-babby because he had killed it! What do you think of that, Dame CloAves?\" \" Eh ! I think he was a brave little chap to face a sarpent, but I think a fine sight more of his blubbering, as you call it,\" said she, taking a tin canister from a shelf, and putting it on the counter with an emphatic bounce. \" Ah ! I thought I could match the young fool with an old one,\" said he derisively, to hide his own satisfaction, as he took his short legs to the door. But Mrs. Clowes called him back, put a large paper parcel in his hand, and said \u2014 \" Here, Jotty, see you give these sweetmeats to your cry-a babby, and tell him an old woman says there's no harm in fighting in self-defence with any kind of a snake, or for his own good name, or to protect the helpless ; but, if he fights just to show off his own bravery, he's a coward.

A long, slightly serpentine lake spread its shining waters from end to end Avithin the soft circlet of green ; and this grassy belt served as a promenade for the fashionable inhabitants. And there must have been such in that village of Ardwick early in the century, as now, for the one bell in the tiny turret of St. Thomas's small, plain, red-"], [128, "The Manchester Man. 88 brick chapel rang a fashionable congregation into its neat pews, to listen to the well-toned organ and the devoutly-toned voice of the perpetual curate, the Reverend R. Tweddle, if we may credit an historian of the time. Red-brick church, red-brick houses, hard and cold outside, solid and roomy and comfortable within, as Georgian architecture ever was, overlooked green and pond, but, luckily, overlooked them from a reasonable distance, and, moreover, did not elbow each other too closely, but were individually set in masses of foliage, Avhich toned down the staring brickwork. Time and smoke have done so more effectually since. One of the best, and best-looking of these houses, near the church, Avas the one in which the delicate Mrs. Aspinall had presided for a few brief years. An iron palisade, enclosing a few shrubs and evergreens, separated it from the wide roadway, but behind the screen of brick ran a formal but extensive garden and orchard, well-kept and well-stocked, with a fish-pond as formal in the midst. Fish-ponds encourage damp, and damp encourages frogs, efts, and their kin. Here they abounded, and Master Laurence had a sort of instinctive belief that they were created solely for his sport and amusement. Mr. Aspinall, his father, immersed in business during the day, and occupied with friends at home or abroad until late hours at night, saw very little of his son, who was thus con signed to servants during those hours not spent, or supposed to be spent, at a preparatory school close at hand. The boy was quick and intelligent, had his mother's amber curls and azure eyes, her delicate skin and brilliant colour, but the handsome face had more of the father therein, and was too unformed to brook description here. What he might have been with other training is not to be told, but under the supposition that he inherited his mother's fragile"], [129, "The Manchester Man. 89 constitution, he had been woefully spoiled and pampered. Opposition to his will was forbidden. \" Bear with him, Kitty, for my sake, and do not thwart him, or you will break his fine spirit,\" had been Mrs. Aspinall's dying charge to her old nurse ; and as every demonstration of temper was ascribed by both parents to this same \" fine spirit,\" what wonder that he grew up masterful \u2014 and worse ? His imperious disposition early ingratiated him into the favour of Bob, his father's groom ; and this man, thinking no evil, ignorantly sowed the seeds of cruelty in his young heart. When the horses were singed, the boy was allowed to be a spectator ; if a whelp had his ears cropped, or the end of its tail bitten of, he was treated to a sight. If a brood of kittens or a litter of puppies had to be drowned, Master Laurence was sure to be in at the death. He was taken to surreptitious cock-fights and rat hunts ; and though, when too late, Mr. Aspinall turned the man away for inclining his son to \" low pursuits,\" nothing was said or done to counteract these lessons of cruelty ! No wonder, then, that to him the sight of pain inflicted brought pleasure, or that inhumanity went hand-in-hand with self-will. One incident \u2014 a real one \u2014 will suffice to show what Laurence Aspinall was, when Jabez Clegg shed tears over the snake he had killed perforce. Kitty was in the kitchen alone. The maids were in other parts of the house. She was sitting close to a blazing fire on account of her \" rheumatics,\" and was in a dose. The evening was drawing in. Master Laurence, coming direct from the garden and the fish-pond, burst open the kitchen door with a whoop which made Kitty start from her nap in a fright. Thereupon he set up a loud laugh as the poor old woman held her hand to her side, and panted for breath. In his hand was his pocket-handkerchief, tied like a bundle, in which something living seemed to move and palpitate. They were"], [130, "The Manchester Man. 90 young frogs in various stages ot development. \" Now, Kitty,\" said he, \" I'll show you some rare sport \" and taking one of the live frogs out of the handkerchief, deliberately threw it into the midst of the glowing fire. \"There, Kitty; did you hear that?\" cried he in rapture, as the poor animal uttered a cry of agony almost human, whilst he danced on the hearth like a frantic savage round a sacrificial fire. \" Oh, Master Laurence ! Master Laurence ! don't do that \u2014 don't be so cruel ! \" appealed Kitty, piteously. But he had drawn another forth, and crying, \" Cruel ! It's fun, Kitty \u2014 fun ! \" tore it limb from limb, and threw it piecemeal into the blaze. \"There's another! and there's another!\" he shouted in glee, as the rest followed in swift succession ; and Kitty, shrieking in pain and horror, ran from the kitchen, bringing the cook and housemaid downstairs with her cries. For the first time in his life Mr. Aspinall administered a sound castigation to his son, regretting that he had not done it earlier. No more was said of his son's fine spirit ; but, prompt to act, he lost no time in seeking his admission into the Free Grammar School ; and either to spare him the long daily walk, in tenderness for his health (Ardwick was more than a mile away), or to place him under strict supervision, boarded Laurence with one of the masters. Yet he gave that master no clue to his son's besetting sin ; so he was left free to tantalise and torment every weaker creature within his orbit, from the schoolmaster's cat, which he shod with walnut-shells, to the youngest school-boy, whose books he tore and hid, whose hair he pulled, whose cap and frills he soused in the mud. It was a misfortune for himself and others that his pocket money was more abundant than that of his fellows. Never had the apple-woman or Mrs. Clowes a more lavish customer, or one who"], [131, "The Manchester Man. 91 distributed his purchases more freely. Boys incapable of discrimina ting between generosity and profusion dubbed him generous ; and that, coupled with his handsome face and spirited bearing, which they mistook for courage, brought him partizans. Thus, long before his first year expired, and he was drafted from the lower school to the room above, where he came under the keen eye and heavy ferule of Joshua Brookes, he had a body of lads at his beck (many older than himself), ready for any mischief he might propose. As well may be supposed, there was a natural antagonism between the boys of the Grammar School and of Chetham's Hospital. As at the confluence of two streams the waters chafe and foam and fret each other, so it is scarcely possible for two separate communities, similar, yet differing in their constitutions, to have their gateways close together at right angles without frequent collision between the rival bodies. In the great gate of the College, only open on special occasions, was a small door or wicket, for ordinary use ; and some of the Grammar School boys, under pretence of shortening their route homeward, finding it open, would make free to cross the College Yard at a noisy canter, and let themselves out at the far gate on Hunt's Bank. It was a clear trespass. They were frequently admonished by one official or another ; their passage was disputed by the Blue-coat boys ; but they persisted in setting up a right of road, and opposition only gave piquancy to their bravado. That which began with individual assumption soon attained the character of boldly-asserted party aggression, and, as the Blue-coat boys were as determined to preserve their rights as the others were to invade them, many and well-contested were the consequent fights and struggles. And thus the two boys, Jabez Clegg and Laurence Aspinall, brought together first at the church"], [132, "The Manchester Man. 92 door and the baptismal font, came into collision again. But now there was no deferential stepping aside of the humble foundling to make way for the merchant's son. They stood upon neutral ground, strangers to each other, equal in their respective participation in the benefits of a charitable foundation. Nay, if anything, Jabez had the higher standpoint. His orphanhood and poverty had given him a right to his position in Humphrey Chetham's Hospital ; the very wealth of the gentleman's son made Laurence little better than a usurper in Hugh Oldham's Grammar School. But it is no part of the novelist's province to prate of the use or abuse of charitable institutions, or to set class in opposition against class. It is only individual character and action as they bear upon one another with which we have to deal. On more than one occasion Jabez \u2014 since his conquest of the snake, the recognised champion of his form \u2014 had stopped Laurence Aspinall at the head of a file of boys, and had done his best to bar their passage through the quadrangle. Success depended on which school was first released If in time, Jabez planted himself by the little wicket with one or two companions, and, like Leonidas at Thermopyl\u00e6, fought bravely for possession of the pass, and generally contrived to beat off the intruders. Sometimes the Blue-coat boys made a sortie from the yard, and, falling upon the others pell-mell, left and bore aAvay marks of the contest in swollen lips and black eyes. At length matters were brought to a crisis. Thrice had Laurence and his clique been repulsed, and the shame of their defeat heightened by derisive shouts from a tribe of Millgate urchins\u2014 \" Yer's the Grammar Skoo' lads beat by th' yaller petticoats agen ! \" \" Yaller petticoats fur iver ! \" \" College boys agen Skoo' ! Hoorray ! \" Master Laurence might have ground his teeth, and harangued his followers, without obtaining an additional recruit, or spurring"], [133, "The Manchester Man. 93 them to a fresh attempt, but for the taunts of the rabble. But the ignominy of defeat by petticoated College boys was too much for the blood of the Grammar School, and youngsters threw themselves into the party quarrel who had hitherto stood aloof. Laurence Aspinall was superseded. A big, raw-boned fellow named Travis took the lead, and rallied round him not only the lads from the lower school, but the bulk of the juniors in the upper room. It is only fair to add that the senior students were in no wise cognisant of the league, or, being so, carefully shut their eyes and ears. As the result of this organism, on a set day, towards the close of October, when the dusk gathered as the school dispersed, the boys who ran down the wide steps from the upper, and the juveniles who ran up from the lower room, instead of darting forward with a \"Whoop!\" and \"Halloo!\" through the iron gate, on their homeward way, clustered together within the school-yard, and made way for seniors and masters to pass out before them. \"Get off home with you, and don't loiter there!\" cried Joshua Brookes, as he turned in at his own gate, and saw the crowd massing together in the outer playground. \" Get home yourself, St. Crispin !\" shouted Laurence, but not before the house door had closed upon the irascible master. All books and slates not purposely left in school were consigned to three or four of the smallest boys, duly instructed to carry them to Hunt's Bank in readiness for their OAvners. For a week or more the College boys had been unmolested; not a forbidden foot had stepped within the wicket. The school master had remarked to the governor, in the presence of his pupils, that he thought Dr. Smith must have prohibited further intrusion. All the greater was the surprise that dusky October afternoon when a troop of young ruffians, who had stolen quietly one by one through the wicket, and kept under the cavernous shade of"], [134, "The Manchester Man. 94 the deep gateway until all were within, rushed, with vociferous shouts, from under cover, and tore across the large yard in the direction of the other gate, daring anyone to check them. The College boys, just emerging from their school-room door in the corner, were, for the moment, taken aback. Then, from the mouth of Joshua Brookes' new Latin scholar, rang, clear and distinct, Humphrey Chetham's motto \u2014 \"Quod tuum tene !\" (What you have, hold!) and the Blue-coat boys, with one George Pilkington for their leader, threw themselves, at that rallying cry, like a great wave, headlong upon the intruders. They met the shock as a rock meets a wave, and down went many a gallant Blue-coat in the dust. Up they were in an instant, face to face with the besiegers ; and then, each singling out an opponent, fought or wrestled for the mastery with all the courage and animosity, if not the skill, of practised combatants. Ben Travis and George Pilkington fought hand to hand, and Jabez \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 measured his strength with Laurence. Heavier, stronger, older by a few months, Jabez might have overmatched his antagonist ; but Laurence had profited by the lessons of Bob, the discarded groom, and every blow was planted skilfully, and told. Then Bob's teaching had been none of the most chivalrous, and Laurence took unfair advantage. He \"struck below the belt,\" and then tripping Jabez up, like the coward that he Avas, kicked him, as he lay prostrate, with the fury of a savage. Governor, schoolmaster, librarian, and porter had hastened to the scene ; but the assailants nearly doubled the number of the College boys, and set lawful authority at defiance, hurling at them epithets such as only schoolboys could devise. Fortunately, their own Blue-coat boys were amenable to discipline, and, called off, one by one retreated to the house, often with pursuers close at their heels. Then the Grammar"], [135, "THE FIGHT IN THE COLLEGE YARD."], [136, ""], [137, "The Manchester Man. 95 School tribe set up a scornful, triumphant shout, and, with Ben Travis and Laurence Aspinall at their head, marched out of the College Yard at the Hunt's Bank gate, exulting in their victory, even though they left one of their bravest little antagonists insensible behind them"], [138, "CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH THE BLUE-COAT BOY. HOSE Avere rough days, when an occasional brawl was sup- posed essential to test the mettle of man or boy, so that bruises and black eyes (the result of an encounter for the honour of the school) were passed over with much lighter penalties than would be dealt out now-a-days if young gentlemen in a public academy descended to black- guardism.

There were few loiterers on that drear October morning. Conscience, and perhaps a dread of consequences, had kept the preceding day's war-party sufficiently awake, even where sore limbs did not. But, with the exception of a few smart raps with the ferule, to warm cold fingers, and"], [139, ""], [140, "THE REV. JEREMIAH SMITH, D.D. From an Engraving."], [141, "The Manchester Man. 97 a general admonition \u2014 little heeded \u2014 the early hours of the morning passed quietly enough, more congratulatory than prophetic. That day went by, and the next. Laurence Aspinall, whose \" science \" had saved his head from more damage than a cut lip, was especially boastful ; and, after his own underhand fashion, strove to stir big Ben Travis to fresh demonstrations. Then a cloud loomed in the horizon and darkened eA'ery master's brow. Another Avhisper was in circulation that Governor Terry had been seen to enter the head-master's ancient black and white old house, and had been closeted with Dr. Smith for more than an hour. Still the quiet was unbroken, and, to the wise, the very calm was ominous. The second of November brought a revelation. On the slightly-raised floor of the high school, at the Millgate end of the \"room, sat, not only Dr. Jeremiah Smith, but the trustees of the school, the Reverend Joshua Brookes, and the assistant masters ; and with them was Governor Terry, of the Chetham Hospital \u2014 all grave and stern. Dr. Smith's mild face Avas unusually severe, and Joshua's shaggy brows loured menacingly over his angry eyes. The senior pupils, chiefly young men preparing for college, were ranged on either side. As the last of these awful personages filed in through the two-leaved door, and took his place, the palpitating hearts of the delinquents beat audibly, and courage oozed from many a clammy palm. The boys Avere summoned from the lower school, and one by one, name by name, Ben Travis and his followers were called to take their stand before this formidable tribunal, Laurence Aspinall shrinking edgeways, as if to screen himself from observation. There Avas little need for Dr. Smith to strike his ferule on the table to command attention, silence was so profound. Even nervous feet forgot to shuffle. Dr. Smith's commanding eye H"], [142, "98 The Manchester Man. swept the trembling rank from end to end, as he stood with impressive dignity to address them. After a brief exordium, in which he recounted the several charges brought against the boys by Governor Terry, he proceeded to say that the good character of the Manchester Grammar School was imperilled by lawless conduct such as the boys before him had exhibited the previous Tuesday, in forcibly entering, and then rioting within, the College Yard. One of the youths \u2014 most likely Ben Travis \u2014 blurted forth that they had a right to go through the College Yard, and that the College boys stopped them. \"You mistake,\" said the doctor, sternly; \"there is no public right of road through the College Yard. Permission is courteously granted, but there is no right. There is a right for the public to pass to and from the College and its library on business, within the hours the gates are open ; but even that must be in order and decency. Your conduct was that of barbarians, not gentlemen.\" At this point of the proceedings Jabez Clegg came into the school-room, leaning on the arm of George Pilkington. The face of the latter was bruised and swollen, but Jabez looked deplorable. His long blue overcoat was rent in more than one place ; he Avalked with a limp ; a white bandage round his head made his white face whiter still, showing more distinctly the livid and discoloured patches under the half-closed eyes. In obedience to a nod from Governor Terry, George Pilkington led his Blue-coat brother to a seat beside him ; but Dr. Smith, drawing the boy gently to his side, removed the bandage, and showed Jabez to the school with one deeply-cut eyebrow plaistered up. \" What boy among you has been guilty of this outrage ? \" he asked, sternly. There was no answer. Some of the little ones took out their handkerchiefs and began to whimper, fearing condign punishment."], [143, "The Manchester man. 99 The doctor repeated his question. The boys looked from one to another, but there was still no reply. Laurence Aspinall edged farther behind his coadjutor, but he had not the manliness either to confess or regret. His only fear was detection, or betrayal by a traitor. There was little fear of that ; grammar-school boys have a detestation of a \"sneak.\" \" Boys, Ave cannot permit the perpetrator of such an outrage to remain in your midst ; he must be expelled ! \" Still no one spoke. \"Do you think you could recognise your assailant \u2014 the boy who kicked you after you were down ? \" (a murmur ran round the school as the classes were ordered to defile slowly past Dr. Smith's desk). Ben Travis walked with head erect \u2014 he would have scorned such a deed \u2014 and Laurence tried to do the same, but his cruel blue eyes could not meet those of his possible accuser. There was a struggle going on in the heart of Jabez. It Avas in his power to revenge himself for many taunts and sarcasms, and much previous abuse. He called to mind \u2014 for thought is swift \u2014 that Shrove Tuesday Avhen Laurence and his friends caught him as he descended Mrs. Clowes' steps with a penny- Avorth of humbugs in his hand, and snatching his cap from his head, kicked it about Half Street and the churchyard as a football. And he seemed to feel again the twitch at his dark hair and the dreadful pain in his spine and loins, as they bent him backwards over the coping of the low wall, in order to wrest his sweets from him, and held him there perforce till stout Mrs. Clowes, armed with a rolling-pin, came to his rescue, laying about her vigorously, and kept him in her back parlour until he revived. \" Forgive and forget \" are words for the angels, and Jabez was not an angel, but a boy with quick-beating pulses, and a"], [144, "the Manchester Man. 100 vivid memory. There was a fight going on in his breast fiercer than either that in Half Street or that in the College Yard. His sore, stiff limbs, and smarting brow, urged him like voices to \"pay him off for all,\" and revenge began to have a sweet savour in his mouth. As he hesitated, watching the slow approach of his foe among his nobler mates, a harsh voice behind him called out, \"Jabez, why do you not answer Dr. Smith ? \" The emphasis Joshua Brookes had laid upon the \" Jabez \" recalled the boy's better self. The oft-repeated text flashed across his mind, \"Jabez was an honourable man,\" and it shaped his reply. \"Well, sir, it was almost dark, and\u2014 and \"\u2014he was going to add too dark to distinguish features, but he recollected that that would be a falsehood, and lying Avas no more honourable than malice. \" And you could not recognise him, you mean ? \" suggested Dr. Smith. His lip quivered \"No, sir, I do not mean that. It was very dark, but I think I should know him again. But, oh ! if you please, sir, I should not like to turn him out of school. You see, we were all fighting together, and we were all in a passion, and \u2014 and \u2014 it would be very mean of me to turn him out of school because he hurt me in a fight\" (Jabez did not say a fair fight). \" Ah ! \" said Dr. Smith, and, turning to Mr. Terry, asked, \"Are all the Chetham lads reared on the same principle?\" Then there was a low-voiced discussion amongst trustees and masters. Finally, Dr. Smith turned round. His clear eye had detected the culprit as he winced beneath the gaze of Jabez. But the injured boy had forgiven, and it Avas not for him to condemn."], [145, "The Manchester Man. 101 Again he spoke \u2014 proclaimed how Jabez had magnanimously declined to single out his cowardly antagonist ; and that the boy, Avhoever he might be, had to thank his most honourable victim that he was not ignominiously expelled. Then quietly, but emphatically, he pronounced the decision of the trustees that instant expulsion should follow any or every repetition of the offence Avhich had called them together \u2014 not only the expulsion of the ringleaders, but of all concerned ; and that even a fair fight between a Grammar School and a Blue-coat boy should be visited with suspension pending enquiry, the offender to be expelled, whether from School or College. \" Good lad, Jabez \u2014 good lad ! \" said Joshua Brookes to him, as George Pilkington helped his limping steps from the room. On the broad flat step outside the door they encountered big Ben Travis, who caught the hand of Jabez in a rough grip, with the exclamation, \" Give us your fist, my young buck ! You've more pluck in your finger than that carroty Aspinall has in his whole carcase, the mean cur ! An' look you, my lad, if any of them set on you again, I'll stand by and see fair play ; or I'll fight for you if it's a big chap, or my name's not Ben Travis.\" \"Who talks of fighting? Haven't you had enough for one while, you great raw-boned brute? You'd better keep your ready fists in your pockets, Travis, if you don't want to be kicked out of school:\" After Avhich gruff reminder Joshua left them, and Jabez went back to the College with one more friend in the world ; but that friend was not Laurence Aspinall. He, smarting under a sense of obligation, shrunk away to bite his nails and vent his spleen in private, conscious that he Avas shunned by his classmates, and despised by honest Ben Travis. As months and seasons sped onwards, they plucked the hairs from Simon Clegg's crown, and left a bald patch to tell of care or coming age ; they stole the roundness from Bess's figure, the"], [146, "The Manchester Man. 102 hope from her heart and eyes. There Avas less vigour in the beat of her batting-wand, less elasticity in her step. The periodical holidays and cheering visits of Jabez were the only pleasant breaks in the monotonous life of the Cleggs. Beyond the knowledge obtained at the billeting office in King Street that Tom Hulme had entered the army and gone abroad Avith his regiment, no tidings of the self-exiled soldier had come to them. In the great vortex of war his name had been swallowed up and lost. But she never said \"Ay\" to Matthew Cooper, though he waited and waited, smoking his Sunday pipe by the fireside even till his own Molly Avas old enough to have a sweetheart, and to want to leave her father's crowded hearth for a quieter one of her oavii. Those same months and years added alike to the stature and attainments of Jabez Clegg and Laurence Aspinall, though in very unequal ratio. The former, though he had long since astonished Simon with his fluent rendering of the big Bible, was but a plodding scholar of average ability, the range of whose studies Avas limited, notwithstanding Parson Joshua's voluntary Latin lessons. The latter had an aptitude for learning, which made his masters press him forward ; and Joshua Brookes forgave the tricks he played, his translations Avere so clear and so correct. Yet, when he wrote stinging couplets or \" St. Crispin \" on the Parson's door, or put cobblers'-wax on the pedagogue's chair, the covert reference to his parentage stung the irascible man more than the damage to kerseymere, and in his wrath he birched his pupil into penitence. His penitence took a peculiar form. A discovery Avas made that a general dance in the school-room would shake the pewter platters and crockery down from dresser and corner cupboard in Joshua's house adjoining. Whenever the dominie had growled over bad lessons with least cause, Laurence was sure to propose a grand hornpipe after school hours. Back would rush Joshua fast as his short legs would carry him, spluttering Avith passion ; but the"], [147, "The Manchester man. 103 nimbler lads disappeared when they heard the crash, and, as a rule, Joshua's temper cooled before morning. Laurence Aspinall's chief source of amusement from his first entrance into the Grammar School had been the crippled father of Joshua Brookes. As the old fellow staggered home drunk, the street boys would hoot at him, pull him about, pelt him with mud, and mock at him, till his impotent fury found vent in a storm of vile and opprobrious language. Laurence was sure to enjoy a scene of this kind, but he was generally sly enough to act as prompter, not as principal. The old man Avas a great angler; and that he might enjoy unmolested his favourite pastime, his son had obtained from Colonel Hansom permission for him to fish in Strangeways Park ponds. Thither he had an empty hogshead conveyed, and the crippled old cobbler, with a flask of rum for company, sat within it, often the night through, to catch fish. The Irk had not then lost its repute for fine eels, and old Brookes \u2014 who, by the way, wore his hair in a pigtail \u2014 was likewise wont to plant himself, with rod and line, on what was the Waterworth Field, on the Irwell side of Irk Bridge, to catch eels. Returning one afternoon (Joshua was busied with clerical duties), Laurence Aspinall and his fellows met the old man staggering along with his rod over his shoulder and a basket of eels in one hand. He had called at the \"Packhorse\" for a dram, and went on, as was his wont, talking noisily to himself. He had steered round the corner in safety; but hearing one lively voice call out, \"Here's Old Fishtail;\" and another, \"Here's St. Crispin's Cripple ;\" and a third, \" Make way for Diogenes,\" as he Avas passing the high-master's ancient house he gave a lurch, meaning to reprove them solemnly \u2014 the top of his rod caught in the prominent pillar of the doorway, and Avas torn from his insecure grasp. Striving to recover it, he pitched forward, and in falling"], [148, "The Manchester Man. 104 dropped his basket in the mud, and set the writhing, long-liA'ed fish at liberty to swim in the gutter swollen with recent rain. The lounging lads at once set up a shout ; but Laurence, with a timely recollection that the front of Dr. Smith's was scarcely the most convenient place for his purpose, winked at his companions, and, with an aspect of mock commiseration, politely assisted the old man to rise, begged the others to capture the eels and carry the basket for him, and, under pretence of putting the angler's rod in order, contrived to fasten the hook to the end of his old-fashioned pigtail. Then he helped his unsteady steps until they were fairly out of Dr. Smith's sight and hearing ; but they did not suffer him to reach his son's house before they showed their true colours. Loosing his hold, Laurence snatched at the rod, and, darting Avith it towards the College gate, cried out in high glee, \" I've been fishing; look at the fine snig (eel) I've caught!\" And, as he capered about, he dragged the poor old cripple hither and thither backwards by his pigtail, to which hook and line were attached. Old Brookes screamed in impotent rage and pain ; the boys laughed and shouted the louder. Thc one Avith his basket set it on his head, and paraded about, crying, \" Who'll buy my snigs ? Fine fresh snigs!\" with the nasal drawl of a genuine fish-seller. Once or twice the old man fell down, uttering awful threats and imprecations ; but Laurence only laughed the more, and jerked him up again with a smart twitch of the line, Avhich was a strong one, and the other three or four young ruffians put up their shoulders, and limped about singing \u2014 \" The fishes diink water, Old Crispin drinks gin ; But the fishes come out When the hook he throws in, Tol de roi.\""], [149, "the Manchester Man. 105 It may be Avondered that none of the neighbours interfered. But it must be remembered that they were accustomed, not only to the uproar of a boyish multitude, but to the drunken raA'ings of old Brookes, who was an intolerable nuisance. Public traffic then was not as now, and policemen Avere unborn. The satisfaction of Laurence Avas at its height. He kept hold of the line ; one of his comrades, named Barret, lashed the persecuted man with an eel for a Avhip, and their mirth was boisterous, when Jabez (now thirteen) came quietly through the Avicket on an errand from the governor. He took in the scene at a glance. He could not stand by and see injustice done. His dark eyes flashed with indignation as he dashed forward, pulling the line from the hand of Laurence, and tried to disentangle the cruel hook from the unfortunate pigtail. \"Who asked you to interfere? you petticoated jackanapes!\" bawled Laurence, darting forward, his face as red as his hair, at the same time dealing Jabez a heavy blow on the chest. \"My duty!\" answered Jabez, stoutly, taking no notice of the sneer at himself. \" How could you gentlemen torment a poor old cripple like that?\" \"He's a drunken old sot!\" cried Barret, \"It's downright cruel!\" continued Jabez, as he stood between the jabbering drunkard and his tormentors. \" We're no more cruel than he is ! He's been catching fishes all day. We've only given him a taste of his own hook; and we'll have none of your meddling!\" and out Avent the pugilistic arm of Laurence straight from the shoulder to deal another blow, Avhen it was caught from behind by the bony hand of Ben Travis, bigger and stronger by two years' growth, whilst the other hand gripped his jacket collar."], [150, "106 The Manchester man \"So you're at your cowardly tricks again, Aspinall?\" exclaimed he, holding the other as if in a vice.

Think of you setting on that noble chap who wouldn't turn tell-tale, though he'll carry the mark of your boot to his grave with him !\" Pointing with outstretched hand to Jabez, who, by this time, was handing old Brookes over to the grumbling care of Tabitha, and whose right eyebrow yet showed a red seam, Travis relaxed his hold of Laurence, and he shook himself free. Some warm altercation followed. There was a scowl of sullen defiance on Aspinall's face, and an evil glance towards Jabez, which Travis observing, with a significant nod he linked his arm in that of the Blue-coat boy, and never left him till he reached his destination, Mr. Hyde's ancient and picturesque tea-shop, in Market-street Lane.

In refusing to tender either thanks or apology at Ben Travis's instigation, he lost caste in the school, and the knowledge rankled in his breast, Against the debt of gratitude he owed to Jabez he laid up a fund of envy and spite, out of which he meant to pay him in full the first opportunity. That opportunity had arrived. There were some birds of his own feather, Avho stuck by him, of whom Ned Barret Avas one. Old Brookes had been too drunk to swear posith-ely Avho had molested him, or to obtain credence if he did ; but the inopportune arrival of Jabez and Ben Travis had made detection certain, and nothing was Joshua Brookes so sure to punish with severity as an attack on the father who made his life a burden to him. On the principle that they might \" as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb,\" the noble five resolved to waylay the Blue coat boy on his return, and either extract from him a promise of secrecy, or give him a sound drubbing for his pains."], [156, "The Manchester Man. 110 They were too like-minded for long conference. To put the old breeches-maker off the scent, all dispersed but one, Kit Townley, who pulled a top from his pocket and whipped away at it with as much energy as ever did his Anglo-Saxon ancestors. Perhaps he thought he had a meddlesome College boy under his lash. After a time, the others sauntered back one by one, from contrary directions ; there was more top-Avhipping, and some ot the whips and tops were new. Then when they saw they were unobserved, they adjourned to the school-yard, and laying a cap on the broad step, two or three of them sat down to a game at cob-nut, so that if any unlikely straggler did come that Avay there might be an apparent reason for their presence. It was late in the year. The breeches-maker was seated at early tea, and so were most of his neighbours. The twilight was coming gently down, and the boys, tired of waiting, were about to go home to their own \u2014 Aspinall expecting a reprimand for being late. Jabez, Avho had been delayed at the office of Harrop the printer in the Market Place, came briskly up Avith a parcel in his hand just as they reached the gate. One of them snatched the parcel from him and ran with it into the school-yard. As a natural consequence Jabez followed to regain his property. That was just what they wanted. The light iron gate was pushed-to, and there they Avere, shut in and screened from observation, between the deserted Grammar School on the one hand, and the College School-room on the other, which, with the dormitory above, was equally sure to be empty at that hour. They were free to torment him as they pleased. The parcel was tossed from hand to hand with subdued glee, and their whip-lashes and strung cob-nuts cut at his arms and shoulders, as Jabez sprang forward and darted hither and thither, perplexed"], [157, ""], [158, ""], [159, "The Manchester Man. 111 and baffled in his efforts to recover it. Once or twice it went down on the damp ground, and gained in grime what it lost in shape. \"Oh! dear, dear! do give me my parcel!\" cried Jabez, in perplexity. \" Our governor will think I've been loitering.\" \" And so you have, you canting yellow-skirt. You stopped to put your long finger in our pie ! \" was the swift retort of Laurence, as he interposed his body between Jabez and the boy Avho held his lost charge. \" Eh ! and you went off with Travis, wasting your time ! \" added Kit Townley. \" I never waste my time on an errand.\" \" Oh ! Miss Nancy never wastes time on an errand,\" mimicked Ned Barret ; and still they kept the boy on the run, until he leaned, out of breath, against the Avail which served as a parapet above the river. Then, the disputed prize being kept by Kit Townley at a respectable distance, Laurence advanced to parley with him, offer ing to restore his parcel and let him go if he Avould take a solemn oath, which he dictated, to maintain silence on all Avhich had transpired that afternoon. \"I cannot; I must account for my time,\" firmly answered Jabez, \"and I must account for that dirty parcel.\" \" Tell them you tumbled down and hurt yourself,\" suggested Aspinall. \" I cannot ; it Avould be untrue ! ' At this the lads set up a loud guffaw, as if truth were somewhat out of fashion ; but the one who stood nearest the gate with the parcel looked restless, as if beginning to be tired of the whole business. Just then Laurence went blustering up to the College boy, and, thrusting his face forward, said \u2014"], [160, "The Manchester Man. 112 \" If you don't go down on your marrow-bones this instant, and swear to tell no tales, we'll pitch you over the wall.\" \"You dare not!\" boldly retorted Jabez, Avith a set face. \" Oh ! daren't we ? We'll see that ! Lend a hand.\" \" No, you dare not ! \" repeated he, planting himself firmly against the wall. There was a sudden rush ; they closed round him, more in bravado than with any intent to do him bodily harm ; sliding him up against the smooth-worn brickwork, they hoisted him above their shoulders, meaning to hold him there. But in their eagerness they had thrust him too far, and crowding on each other, one, being jostled, let go, and Jabez toppled over the precipice ! There was a scream ; a splash in the water. Tabitha, taking clothes from a line in the back-yard, cried out, \" What is that ? \" Parson Brookes' startled pigeons flew from their dove cote, and wheeling round in widening circles, cooed affrightedly. The white-faced boys stood aghast. Unless his fall had been seen from the opposite croft, their victim would be drowned before any aid they could bring was available ; a Avide circuit must be taken before a bridge could be reached. Buildings blocked up that side of the river. They looked at each other and spoke in whispers ; then, Avith an animal instinct of self preservation, sneaked off in silence and terror, leaving him to his fate. Not all. Kit Townley, Avho held the parcel, had draAvn near to remonstrate. With a shriek he threw down the paper, and, hardly conscious Avhat he did, tore wildly through the gates, and across the College Yard, to startle the first he met with the alarm that a College boy Avas drowning in the Irk !"], [161, "CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.

Like a cork he rose, and struck out across the river. The slimy stone embankment seemed to slip from his touch ; there was no hold for his hand ; it Avas too steep and smooth to climb ; and he felt that the river, swift in its fulness, was bent on bearing him to the Irwell, so dangerously near. He raised his voice for \" Help ! \" Tabitha, listening, answered with a scream and a shout, and, bolting into the house, disturbed the Parson and his besotted father \"at their tea\" by the outcry she made, as she rushed on into the street Avith the alarm of \" A lad dreawndin ! \" just as the conscious culprits slunk past to their own quarters. Doctor Stone, the first recipient of terrified Kit Townley's incoherent intelligence, was simultaneously racing at full speed, Avith a troop of College boys at his heels, down towards Hunt's Bank and the outlet of the Irk, with the swift consciousness that the only hope of saving life was in the chance of reaching the confluence of the rivers first. He thought the dusk never came down so rapidly. A lamplighter, Avith ladder and flaring long-spouted oil-can light, was going his rounds. \"Turn back, my man, with ladder and light,\" he called out, without stopping ; and the man, seeing something unusual Avas astir or amiss, followed at a canter without question. At Irk Bridge the librarian took the light from the man, and swung it to cast its reflection over the Irwell ; but nothing was to be seen or heard but the full river, and the wash of its waters. To cross the bridge, in fear that the boy was beyond help, was but the work of a moment. Slower, along the wooden railing of the Irk embankment, he held the lamp low. There was neither eddy or bubble on the water to tell where a drowning mortal had gone down. \" Jabez ! Jabez Clegg ! \" he cried, but there was no response.

Gruff Joshua drew the back of his hand across his shaggy brows. \" And so the greedy river has swallowed the bright lad at last !

It was Bess, with Simon at her heels, close as his stiff rheumatic limbs Avould carry him. She Avrung her hands bitterly. \"Is it true?\" she cried in anguish, \"is it true? Oh, Parson Brucks, is it true that ar Jabez is dreawnded?\" There Avas the same choking in his voice as he answered \" I'm afraid so, Bess,\""], [166, "116 The Manchester Man.

Dr. Stone, hurrying forward, continued \u2014 \" Follow me to the College for lanterns to renew the search.\" And no second invitation was needed. And where was Jabez ? He heard Tabitha's cry, but it came from the wrong side, and he had sense to know was useless to save, unless he could withstand the current till help came round. But the strong stream was bearing him on against his will. Suddenly he bethought him of the dairy steps, and, Avith a stroke of his left arm, swerved towards the hoary building looming through the twilight.

His dark robe, his position, the jutting Avail \u2014 all contributed to hide him from the poor rays of the one oil-lamp which Avas flashed along the stream to find him. And there he might have lain and died had not Nancy, for lack of a boy at hand to wait on her, gone down to the cellar for milk for the boys' supper. As she filled the wooden piggin she had taken with her, she fancied she heard a moan, and, listening breathless, heard another, and another, from the outside of a door which was (to her thought) inaccessible to mortal. Down went the piggin and the milk (she was not a strong minded woman, and it Avas a superstitious age), up the steps she stumbled in her fright, crying \u2014 \" Oh, theer's a boggart in th' dairy ! \u2014 theer's a boggart ! \" Dr. Stone and his companions came in at the porch as she fled upwards towards the kitchen.

They understood well enough when he came back into their midst, burdened with the limp, dripping form of Jabez, Avhite and insensible, and depositing him on a settle near the kitchen fire, cried out for restoratives. That was a terrible next morning, when the young miscreants, as much afraid to play truant as to face possibilities at school,"], [170, "118 The Manchester Man. sneaked to their places and set to their studies with industry out of the common. Laurence Aspinall, boarding with a master, had no choice in the matter. How Jabez got into the water was not clear ; he was too ill to be questioned over-night, and was in a fever and delirious by noon the next day. But he had never been known to loiter or go astray when sent on an errand. Kit Townley 's impulsive cry of alarm had suggested foul play, and neither Joshua Brookes nor Governor Terry had let the night pass without an effort to dive into the truth. Dr. Stone had conjectured Kit Townley to be a Grammar School boy, although personally unknown to him ; and that conjecture recalled to Joshua his father's ravings of ill-usage, which he had at the time regarded as drunken maudling. It was ascertained that the boy had been at Ford's and at Harrop's. Inquiry, and the search for the missing parcel, resulted in the discovery of a trampled playground, broken whiplashes, a string of cobnuts, and, neatly marked in red cotton with his initials, one of Laurence Aspinall's cambric ruffles, torn and muddy as the parcel. There was a conference with Dr. Jeremiah Smith before the night was out. A messenger was sent to Mr. Aspinall in Cannon Street the next morning, as Avell as to the trustees of thc school. The following day saw such another conclave as before in the Grammar School. Dr. Stone, who Avas present, picked out the boy who had given the alarm; and Kit Townley, trembling for himself, told all he knew. Ben Travis, at the outset, in his indignation, proffered his evidence, which went to prove malice prepense. The boys, asked what they had to say for themselves, simply answered they had done it for \"sport\" \u2014 that they did not mean"], [171, "the Manchester Man. 119 to throw him over, but only to frighten him to \" hold his tongue,\" and excused their running home on the plea that they were \" afraid.\" Laurence Aspinall boldly said that he knew the boy could swim and did not think a ducking would do him much harm, and offered to jump off the wall and swim down the river himself. Liar as well as boaster, he received a summary check from Dr. Smith, apart from the reprimand administered to him as the proven ring-leader. In these days such a case of outrage would have been brought before a magistrate, and the offenders' names sent flying through newspaper paragraphs. Then, whether to spare the parental feelings of such influential men as Mr. Aspinall, or to save from tarnish the fair fame of the school, or to avert the further debasement of the boys from prison contact, and give them a chance to amend, the school tribunal was allowed to be all-sufficient. Ignominious expulsion was dealt out not only to Laurence Aspinall and to Ned Barret, but to each of the conspirators \u2014 Kit Townley, honourably acquitted by them of participation in the final attack, alone escaping with a caution, a severe reprimand, and as severe a flogging ; which special immunity he had purchased by running white-faced to give the alarm. It is possible he scarcely estimated the value of that immunity at the time. But the loud hurrahs Avhich hailed this sentence testified how the Grammar School boys valued their honour as a school, and how proud they were to be purged of such offenders. Mr. Aspinall, too much agitated to witness his son's public disgrace, waited the result of the inquiry in the head-master's house ; and if ever Laurence Aspinall felt ashamed of his own misconduct, it was when his father refused to take his umvorthy hand as they left the door-step, and he heard Dr. Smith's closing Avords of reproof mingled with compassion for the father, in Avhose eyes were signs of tears a bad son had drawn."], [172, "The Manchester Man. 120 Long before Jabez Avas able to resume his OAvn place in the school, Laurence Aspinall had been removed to an expensive boarding-school at Everton, near Liverpool ; and this time the merchant laid stress on his tendency \" for vicious and low pursuits,\" and begged that no efforts or expense might be spared to make him a gentleman in all respects. Still he tampered with the truth, lest the school-master (he would be called a Principal in these factitious days) should refuse to admit a pupil Avith such antecedents, and decline the task of eradicating cruelty and ingratitude. Here Laurence certainly mixed only with boys of his own class, from whom money could buy neither flattery nor favour, and where only his own merits could procure either. And here we must leave him, to pursue the fortunes of the boy whose life he had wantonly imperilled. Had anything been wanting to bespeak Joshua Brookes's good-will, Jabez supplied it when he interfered to protect the elder Brookes from the derisive indignities of others. Not only to Mrs. Clowes did he rehearse in his own peculiar manner the story, as told by Ben Travis, with its supplementary drama which had so nearly proved a tragedy, but at such tables as he frequented \u2014 Mr. Chadwick's among the rest. Mr. Ashton, Avho was present, spoke of being himself a witness to the former scene, and, whilst presenting his inevitable snuff box to the eccentric chaplain, repeated his previous observation \u2014 \" I must look after that boy \u2014 I must indeed ! \" If the parson had been commonly observant he would have noticed a pair of black eyes fixed in eager attention on his, as he, who rarely uttered a commendation, held forth in praise of his father's champion, the Blue-coat boy ; the said black eyes being matched by the black hair, and somewhat dark skin, of the plain but intelligent daughter of his host."], [173, "The Manchester Man. 121 But girls of fifteen were then counted in the category of children, and were taught only to \"speak when spoken to,\" so Ellen Chadwick passed no other commentary on the actions of Jabez than was expressed by her glowing cheeks and eloquent eyes."], [174, "CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH JABEZ GOES INTO THE AVORLD. SHARP illness followed the precipitation of Jabez into the Irk ; but he was young, had a strong constitution, and, to the satisfaction of all in the College, and many out of it, was able to take his place in the refectory, and clear the beef or the potato-pie from his wooden trencher before the month expired. Prior to this, he was allowed an afternoon, ere he was well enough to resume fully his routine duties, to show himself to the kind friends who had exhibited most anxiety for his recovery. Mrs. Clowes was one of KITCHEN DOOR, these. Jam, jelly, and cakes, never concocted within the area of the College, had found their Avay to his bedside. Grateful for kindness from so unlikely a quarter, Jabez paid his first visit to the shop in Half Street, to"], [175, "The Manchester Man, 123 thank the queer old lady. But not one word of thanks would she hear. \" Eh, lad, say naught about it ; you did your duty, and I did mine, and so we're quits ; \" and shook her open hand a few inches in advance of her face, as if she were shaking a disclaimer out of it. \" And where are you taking your Avhite face to noAV ? \" she asked quickly, the better to turn the tide of his stammering thanks. \"To Aunt Bess's.\" \" Why, lad, Bess Clegg'll have naught to give thee fit for sick folk to eat. It's much to me if she'll have either a potato or a drop of milk. If she's a bit of jannock, or oat-cake, it's as much as the bargain. War may be glorious for kings and generals, but it's awful for poor folk ; Mesters can't sell their goods, and can't pay wages bout money ; and I've heard that, since th' potato riots in Shudehill last spring, the folk have been so clemmed that some on them couldna be knoAvn by their friends who hadna seen them for awhile ; they were naught but skin and bone, poor things!\" Whilst indulging in this tirade against war and its concomitants, to distract his attention, she bustled about, often with her back to him ; then dived into her parlour, and returned with a basket, which she was handing to him with a charge to \" take that to Bess, and be sure to bring the basket back safe,\" when she found that Joshua Brookes was standing behind Jabez, amongst waiting customers, Avith a sharp eye on her proceedings. \"I say, young Cheat-the-fishes, what have you got to say for yourself? A nice young ragamuffin you are, to go a-bathing Avithout leave, spoiling your clothes, and giving yourself cold !

Do you call that an accident?\" groAvled the parson, to get at the boy's meaning. \"An accident done a-purpose,\" chimed in Mrs. CloAves, whilst her scales jingled, and she and her helper weighed out her commodities for the people at the counter. \"Yes, sir,\" answered Jabez, composedly: \"it must have been an accident. I don't think they really could mean to push me over. I think they only meant to frighten me \" \" Well ? \" queried Joshua, seeing that he hesitated. \" I think one of them slipped, and let go, and then I slipped too, sir,\" he replied, modestly. \" Slipped, indeed !

Bess and Simon received him with open arms, glad not only to see him well again, but thankful he had been placed Avhere he Avas secure from the bitter Avant AA'hich pinched both their stomachs and their faces. To them Mrs. Clowes' basket brought Avhat they had not seen for months \u2014 a Avhite loaf and a good lump of cold meat, to say nothing of a tiny paper of tea, and some sugar \u2014 those luxuries of the rich \u2014 and half-a-crown in another paper. Hoav those half-famishing hard-workers, whose home had been denuded of their goods to keep life Avithin them, thanked old Mrs. Clowes ! She had made it a festival to them indeed, and all for the sake of the boy they had kept. There Avere no pigeons \u2014 these had been sold long ago, to pay for provisions, though much against Simon's Avill. The cat was there, lean and gaunt ; it managed to pick up a subsistence some how ; and the big bible Avas there \u2014 Simon had not parted Avith that, though the bright bureau was gone, ay, and the cradle which had been an ark to the orphan. The change touched Jabez sorely. Snugly housed and fed within the College, rumours of outer poverty made no lasting impression ; but here he saw its grim reality, and sitting down on the three-legged stool, he covered his face with his hands to hide the tears called up by that insight into their impoverished condition. Yet they had some alleviation of their pain. Poverty appeared to have lost half its bitterness for Bess. She had had a letter from her long-mourned Tom, and the joyful news served to brighten up the visit for Jabez and all. It Avas a long and deeply repentant letter, of course, Avritten by a comrade. It was dated from Badajoz, and had been a Aveary Avhile in reaching them.

From this young fellow, Private John Smith (Tom Avas himself a Corporal), he had learned how grievously his Bess had been slandered ; but with that knowledge had come the conviction that he had con demned her hastily and harshly on mere hearsay, and the letter was incoherent in its remorseful contrition. In his soldier-life he had been tossed hither and thither \u2014 known pain, and thirst, and famine ; and said he owed it all to his own jealous credulity, when he ought to have known so much better. He told of marchings and counter-marchings, battles and bloodshed ; but of never one wound to himself, though he had not \" cared a cast of the shuttle \" for his life until that bayonet-thrust which had laid him side by side with John Smith, who had lost an eye. But he Avound up with a prayer for Bess and himself, and a hope for their re-union, if the Avar should ever end. He \" was sick of it.\" All that letter Avas to Bess and Simon, Jabez could not com prehend ; but he took Mrs. Clowes her empty basket, and Avent back to the College satisfied that one ray of sunshine lit up the poor home of his friends. And Matthew Cooper's last chance was gone. Mr. Ashton was what is known in trade as a small-ware manu facturer \u2014 that is, he was a weaver of tapes, inkles, filletings ; silk, cotton, and worsted laces (for furniture) ; carpet bindings, brace-Avebs, and fringes. Moreover, he manufactured braces and umbrellas, for which latter his brother-in-law supplied the ginghams. He had at work, both in Manchester and at Whaley-Bridge, a number of swivel -engines, the design of Avhich came from those unrivalled tape-weaA'ers, the Dutch, and which Avould weave twenty-four"], [179, "The Manchester Man. 127 lengths of tape or bed-lace at one time. Otherwise, the bulk of his Avorkpeople \u2014 winders, Avarpers, brace, fringe, and umbrella makers \u2014 carried away materials to their own homes, and brought back their work in a finished state. Mr. Chadwick, as we have mentioned, was a manufacturer of ginghams \u2014 this included checks and fustians ; but much of his trade being foreign, the war had locked up his resources, and his anxieties preyed on his health. Mr. Ashton had suffered less in this particular, not having disdained to take his sensible wife's advice \u2014 \"Never put too many eggs in one basket.\" Mrs. Ashton, be it said, had a leaning tOAvards \"proverbial philosophy\" more homely and terse than Tupper's, which, vulgar as it is accounted now, Avas in esteem when our century was young; and, had it been otherwise, would have been equally impressive from her deliberately modulated utterance. This same lady had, moreover, an aptitude for business. Mr. Ashton employed a number of young women, and Mrs. Ashton might be found most days in the warehouse, either \" putting out \" or inspecting the work brought in by them, Avith a gingham wrapper over her \" silken sheen.\" If the footman announced visitors, the Avrapper was thrown aside in a moment, and she stepped into her drawing-room as though fresh from her toilette, and with no atmosphere of dozens, grosses, or great grosses about her. She was wont to say, \" The eye of a master does more work than both his hands;\" accordingly in house or warehouse her active supervision kept other hands from idling, and she certainly dignified whatever duties she undertook, whether she used hands or eyes only. In those days a seven-years' apprenticeship to any trade or business Avas deemed essential ; apprentices were part and parcel of commercial economy, and when Mr. Ashton spoke of \" looking"], [180, "128 The Manchester Man. after that boy,\" it was that he thought Jabez Clegg bade fair to be a fitter inmate and a more reliable servant than others whose terms were about to expire. Through his friend the Rev. Joshua Brookes he ascertained the boy's age and other particulars, and sought the House- Governor, Mr. Terry, and laid before him a proposition to take Jabez Clegg as his apprentice, on very fair terms. He then learned that Mr. Shaw, the saddler at the bottom of Market street Lane, was also desirous to obtain the same Blue-coat boy as an apprentice, his friend the leather-breeches maker having named the lad to him. At the Easter meeting of feoffees both proposals were laid before them \u2014 Simon Clegg, as standing in loco parentis to Jabez, being present. After some little discussion Mr. Ashton's proposal Avas accepted, to the great satisfaction of the tanner, and in a few days Jabez was transferred to his new master for mutual trial until Ascension Day, when, if all parties Avere satisfied, his indentures Avould be signed. As the Governor said, it had \" been but the toss of a button \" Avhether he had gone to Mr. Shaw or Mr. Ashton, yet upon that toss of a button the Avhole future of Jabez depended. The boy entered on his new career under good auspices \u2014 that is, he bore with him a good character for steadiness and probity, though nothing Avas said of brilliant parts, or any special talent which he possessed. Indeed, his schoolmaster had said that only his indomitable perseverance had enabled him to keep pace Avith others. If he had any latent genius \u2014 any particular vocation, no one had discoA'ered it ; his faculty for disfiguring doors and walls with devices in coloured chalks, picked up amongst the gravel, had been matter for punishment, not praise, and none but the College-boys themselves cared to knoAv Avhere the fresh patterns for purses and pincushions came from."], [181, "The Manchester Man. 129 Steadiness, perseverance, probity \u2014 they were good materials out of which to manufacture a tradesman (so Mr. Ashton thought), and congratulations Avere mutual. Jabez Clegg went, with his new outfit, to his new home under good auspices, inasmuch as both master and mistress were pre possessed in his favour, and they stood in the foremost rank of those Avho began to recognise that English apprentices Avere not bondslaves in heathendom. Instead of being crammed to sleep like dogs in holes under counters ; left to wash at a pump and wipe themselves Avhere they could ; obliged to sit at a table in a back kitchen, and dip their spoons into one common dish of porridge, or potatoes and buttermilk ; to eat such scraps and refuse as sordid employers, or ill-disposed cooks, chose to set before their primitive Adamite forks \u2014 instead of a system like this, from which apprentices (of Avhatever grade) only emerged at the beginning of this century, the Ashtons' apprentices had a comfortable dormitory in the attic, there Avas a coarse jack-towel by the scullery-sink for their use, they had their meals Avith the servants in the kitchen, where was an oak settle by the fire for them Avhen work was over. But Avork did not end with the close of the warehouse, They were expected to keep their attic clean and in order, to cleanse the wooden or pewter platters, or porringers, from which they had dined or supped ; to rinse the horns which had held their table-beer ; to fetch and carry wood, coals, and water, for servants too lazy to do their own Avork ; and it was not much rest any apprentice had from five or six in a morning until eight or nine at night, when he went to his bed. As the youngest apprentice, the roughest of this work fell on Jabez, but, luckily, his training had made him equal to the occasion ; though Kezia, the red-faced cook, set herself steadfastly to dislike him, because Mr. Ashton had bespoken her favour for K"], [182, "The Manchester Man, 130 him. In the warehouse, too, the evident goodwill of principals roused the jealousy of underlings, so that \" good auspices \" had their corresponding drawbacks. It was not much of a pleasure to Jabez to find Kit Townley also seated as an apprentice on the kitchen settle ; but the youth seemed disposed to be friendly, and Jabez forbore to create a grievance by recalling unpleasant reminiscences. With Kit Townley, Avho was his senior by a year, a heavy premium had been paid, and on this he was inclined to presume. But neither Mr. nor Mrs. Ashton made any social distinction between the twain, and Jabez Avas strong enough to hold his own. During the few weeks' probation, Jabez was transferred from department to department, alike to test his capacity and his own liking for the business. Both proved satisfactory. On Ascension Day, 1813, there was another appearance in that ancient room before the College magnates, many of whom, as officers in volunteer regiments, Avere in full-dress uniform (a dinner pending). The indentures had to be signed, the premium of \u00a34 (returnable to the boy when his term expired) had to be paid. Simon Clegg's best clothes had long been lost in the pawnbroker's bottomless pit ; but some one unknown (mayhap Mrs. Clowes or Mrs. Clough) had sent him overnight a suit ot fresh ones, pronounced by him and Bess \" welly as good as new ;\" and he presented himself for the important ceremony (overlooked by the painted face of the orphan's benevolent friend, Humphrey Chetham) as proud almost of his own restored respectability as of the part he was about to perform. When it came to his turn to sign the document, the little man took the pen with a flourish, as if he were a hero about to perform some mighty action. He stooped to the heavy oaken table, bent his head low, alternately to the right and left, and with"], [183, "HUMPHREY CHETHAM From mi Engraving*"], [184, ""], [185, "The Manchester Man. 131 his fingers in an unaccountable crump, imprinted his self-taught signature in Roman capitals thereon, then handed back the quill, as if to say \"The deed is done!\" Governor, schoolmaster, and feoffees congratulated Mr. Ashton and Jabez both. Simon, with moist eyes, shook Jabez by the hand, and holding the boy's shoulder with his left to look the better in his clear, dark eyes, said, with deliberate emphasis \u2014 \" Jabez, lad, aw'm preawd on yo' this day. But moind \u2014 thah's an honourable neame ; do nowt to disgrace it, an' yo'r fortin's made !\" Jabez was too abashed to make reply at the time ; but at the supper given in the Mosley Street kitchen to mark his installation at Mr, Ashton's \u2014 to which Bess and Simon were both invited \u2014 Jabez contrived to whisper, \" You needn't clem any more, Bess ; I'll give you all my wages.\""], [186, "CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH. APPRENTICESHIP. TABEZ now began his work in earnest, in the packing- room\u2014 the very lowest rung of the ladder. Not long did he remain there. The bright colours in the rooms for brace-webs and upholsterers' trimmings had an attraction for him, and he argued Avith himself that the better he did the rough work assigned him the sooner he should mount aboA'e it. And Jabez, the plodding Blue-coat boy, Avas ambitious. That ambition had a threefold stimulus, Manchester people Avere then, as a rule, steady church and chapel-goers. Mr. Ashton had two pews at the Old Church : one for his family, the other for serA'ants and apprentices, the attendance of the latter being imperative. Jabez thus came in frequent contact with his old-time friends, from the Blue-coat boys in the Chetham Gallery to the Cleggs, to whom Avent every penny of his earnings ; their distress, like that of others, having deepened with the continuation of the Napoleonic war. Sometimes old Mrs. Clowes, meeting him in the churchyard, Avould grasp him by the hand, and leave something in it, as, in her old black stuff dress and a coloured kerchief tied over her mob-cap, she hurried home to scold dilatory handmaids, and put her Christianity in practice amongst her pensioners. Now and then Joshua Brookes crossed his path, and if he did not put his hand in his breeches' pocket for Jabez \u2014 now a"], [187, "The Manchester Man. 133 well-groAvn youth \u2014 he gave him more than sterling coin in sterling advice, though, unfortunately, in so abrupt and grotesque a manner its effect was frequently lost. Yet one day when the Blue-coat boy had been barely two years at the Mosley Street manufacturer's, he put a spur into the sides of his ambition. \"Young Cheat-the-fishes, were you ever in Mrs. Chadwick's green parlour?\" \" Yes, sir \u2014 I was there once for half-an-hour.\" (The day he took back Miss Ellen's shilling.) \"Well, did you read the sermons on the walls?\" Jabez answered respectfully \u2014 \" I did not see any sermons, sir. I saAV some pictures in black frames with gilt roses at the corners.\" \"And didn't look at them, I suppose?\" in a harsh grunt. \" Yes, sir, I did ! I was waiting till Mrs. Chadwick had done dinner. They were about two boys \u2014 a good and a bad apprentice.\" \"Oh, then, you did use your eyes? The next time they let you inside that room, just use your understanding, too. William Hogarth, the artist, from his grave preaches a sermon to you and your fellows as good as Parson Gatliffe preached from the pulpit this morning, mark that ! \" and he turned on his heel Avith an emphasising nod to fix his sermon on the boy's mind. The opportunity came before long. It was customary when an apprentice went Avith a message to leave him in the hall, or send him into the kitchen; but Jabez, being sent by Mrs, Ashton Avith several samples of furniture-binding and fringes for her sister's use, he was shown with his parcel into the parlour, where Mrs. Chadwick, neatly attired in a brown stuff dress, Avith a French cambric kerchief lying in folds under the square bodice, sat at work with an upholsteress, in the midst of a mass of chintz and moreen, preparing for the new home of Ellen's elder sister"], [188, "The Manchester Man. 134 Charlotte ; for, in spite of Avar, distress, or famine, people will marry and give in marriage. And had not a glorious peace just been concluded ? Ellen, a comely but not pretty girl, about seventeen, whose black eyes and hair were her chief attractions, sat there in a purple bombazine dress, with her sheathed scissors and College pincushion suspended by a chain from her girdle, plying her needle most industriously. He was not accustomed to parlours, and no doubt his bow Avas as awkward as his blush ; but he had a message to deliver, and he did that in a business-like manner. He had to wait until pattern after pattern Avas tried against the chintz, and calculations made. Mrs. Chadwick. seeing his eyes wander Avistfully from picture to picture, courteously gave him permission to examine them. At once Ellen, Avho was sitting close under one, rose to act as interpreter. She was recalled by the mild voice of her mother. \" Sit down, Ellen. Jabez Clegg does not require a young lady's help to understand those pictures\u2014 they explain themselves.\" Ellen went back to her seat and her sewing Avith a raised colour, and a private impression that the rebuke Avas uncalled for, though she spoke never a word. Perhaps Mrs. Chadwick thought condescension should haA'e its limits, and did not believe in a lady's impulsiA'e civility to an apprentice Blue-coat boy. Yet that was not like Mrs. Chadwick. Miss Augusta had been staying with her aunt. Part of his commission was to convoy her home ; she was an only child, and too precious to be trusted out alone, though she Avas in her eleventh year, and the distance was nothing. But so many desperadoes had been let loose by the termination of the Avar, that crime and violence Avas rampant, footpads infested highways and byways, and Cicily, Augusta's maid \u2014 cx-nurse \u2014 Avas no longer deemed a protection,"], [189, "The Manchester Man. 135 He stood before the last engraving when Augusta \u2014 in no awe of her father's apprentice \u2014 came dancing into the room in a nankeen dress and tippet, a hat with blue ribbons, long washing gloves which left the elbows bare, and blue shoes tied with a bunch of ribbons. Bright, beautiful, buoyant \u2014 she was a picture in herself; and Jabez turned from the dingy engraving to think so. She often came tripping into the warehouse or the kitchen, and exchanged a bright word with one or other, and away again ; but Jabez had thought of her only as a pretty playful child until that afternoon. Joshua Brookes pointing Hogarth's lessons had given the one spur ; that lovely brown-eyed, broAvn-haired maiden, Avith her simple, \" Come, Jabez \u2014 I'm ready,\" had given another. She put her little gloved hand in his, after bidding her aunt and cousin good-bye, and went dancing, skipping, and chattering by his side down Oldham Street, and let him lift her over the muddy crossing to Mosley Street, unconscious of the chimerical dreams floating through his apprentice brain all the while. His original ambition to make a home for Simon and Bess, where neither penury nor care should trouble them, dwarfed before the new ideas crowding upon his mind. He had read the sermon on the wall, but the old \" Knave of Clubs,\" as Joshua Avas called, little thought how that pretty, piquant little fairy, the \" master's daughter,\" Avould point it with something higher than ambition. There were at that period in Manchester two schools for young ladies, which, being celebrated at the time, deserve to be mentioned. The one was situated at the extreme end of Bradshaw Street, looking through its vista across Shudehill to the gaps in brickwork called Thomas Street and Nicholas Croft, where, in highly genteel state Mrs. (or Madame, as she insisted on being called) Broadbent superintended the education of a large and very select circle."], [190, "The Manchester Man. 136 Education must have been at a low ebb when the chief manu facturers of the town consigned their daughters to this pompous, pretentious woman, who could not speak correctly the language she professed to teach. In her attempt to appear the print and pattern of a lady, she \"clipped the King's English,\" and made almost as glaring errors as Mrs. Malaprop. Yet, strange to say, she turned out first-class pupils (for the period). The fact is, she was shrewd enough to know her own deficiencies, and relegated her duties to others who were in all respects efficient. Then she was a Avonderful trumpeter of her own fame ; made frequent visitations at houses where she was well-entertained, and her bombast was listened to for the sake of her young charges; held half-yearly recitations, and also exhibitions of the plain sewing, embroidery, knitting, knotting, filigree, tambour, and lace Avork of her pupils ; and matrons, proud of their own daughters' achieve ments, seldom paused to reckon up the tears, the headaches, the heartaches, the sore fingers Avhich those minutely-stitched shirts, those fine lace aprons and ruffles, those pictures and samplers, had cost. For Madame Broadbent, besides being a martinet rigid in her rule \u2014 having a numbered rack for pattens and slippers, numbered pegs for cloaks and hats, book-bags and work-bags, safe-guards (receptacles for sewing, &c, like a huckster's pocket) and slates, all numbered likewise \u2014 Avas not of too mild a temper, and had a penchant for pinching her pupils' ears until the blood tinged her nails ; while stocks for the feet, backboards for the shoulders, and dry bread diet were her prescriptions for the cure of such delinquencies as an unauthorised word, an omitted curtsey, a bag or garment on the wrong hook, a dropped stitch in knitting, a blotted copy, a puckered seam ; and Avork had to be done and undone until stitches were almost invisible, and little eyes almost blind. She had other peculiarities, had Madame Broadbent \u2014 but"], [191, "The Manchester Man. 137 my portrait is growing too large for its frame, and she was not a large personage at all. It was to this delectable individual's school (\"establishments\" had not been invented then, or her's Avould have been one) that Miss Augusta Ashton was consigned for conversion into a Avell-behaved, well-informed, useful, and accomplished young lady. Her cousins, the Misses Chadwick, had in their turns escaped from this penitentiary for the manufacture of ladyhood. But in Piccadilly was a school of a very different description, where young ladies of talent and fortune went to qualify for wifehood ; and here at this time Ellen Chadwick Avas finishing her education, with many others, in learning the culinary art in all its branches. How came it that Madame Broadbent's school flourished and survived the decay of its neighbourhood, being in existence when the writer of this was a child, and the other had died and been forgotten, save by the antiquary, before she Avas born ? To fetch Miss Ashton home from Madame Broadbent's on dark or stormy afternoons, was the understood duty of one or other of the apprentices ; but Kit Townley, having no more liking for wet weather than a cat, generally contrived to be out of earshot when his services were required. It devolved on Jabez, therefore, to carry the grey duffel hooded-cloak with which to cover the dainty one of scarlet kerseymere, to tie the pattens on the tiny feet, to carry the school-bag, and hold the brilliant blue gingham umbrella over the head elevated by the pattens so much nearer to his shoulder, and to be thanked by one of the sweetest voices in the world. It Avas dangerous work, though no one knew it, least of all Jabez. True, she Avas only a child, but she Avas tall for her age. And was he much more than a boy ? A boy let out from the seclusion of an almost monastic institution, to whom her little"], [192, "138 The Manchester Man. airs and graces, her pretty vanities, her very waywardness and caprice, only made her beauty more piquant. Madame Broadbent's infallibility being taken for granted, all attempts to make known school troubles and grievances were met Avith \" Never tell tales out of school,\" from Mrs. Ashton, but they were poured fresh and warm into the ear of Jabez, as she trotted by his side ; and he, his school-days unforgotten, listened Avith ready sympathy. And this Avent on as months and years went by, adding to her stature, narroAving the space between them ; and he still did duty as her humble escort, unless when Kit Townley was especially told off for the service, and Avent reluctantly, grumbling at being made \" lackey to a school miss.\" Yet Kit Townley did not think it any degradation to play practical jokes on Jabez, or on Kezia, lea\\'ing the younger appren tice to bear the blame. Billets of Avood, scuttles of coal, pails of water brought in for her use by Jabez, were dexterously removed to doorways and other unsuspected places, where \" cook \" Avas sure to stumble over them, and then cuff Jabez for his carelessness or Avilfulness, all protestations on his part being disregarded. Creeping behind the settle Avhere Jabez sat Avatching, and perhaps basting the roast for the master's table for late dinners on company days, he would steal his sly arm round the corner, himself unseen, and lifting the Avheel of the spit out of the smoke-jack chain, bring spit and all thereon into the dripper, with a splash Avhich brought the irate Kezia down on astounded Jabez with whatsoever weapon of offence came nearest to her hand, from the paste-pin to the basting-ladle, or even a saucepan lid \u2014 it was all one to Kezia. From Kezia, however, these frequent chances and mischances went to Kezia's mistress ; and, appearances being against him, the very steadiness of denial, unaccompanied with any accusation of another (other waggeries of Kit Townley in the warehouse"], [193, "The Manchester Man. 139 being also laid on his shoulder), Mrs. Ashton's faith in the youth was someAvhat shaken, and he Avas conscious of being under a cloud. But he still kept on his way, and looked to the end The cloud dispersed after a Avhile. Kit Townley was something of a glutton, Avith a very boy's love of pastry and sweets. It so happened that on a special occasion (rejoicing for peace or something) Kezia had set aside in her roomy pantry, the door of Avhich fastened only Avith a button, a tray of tartlets, custards, a trifle, moulds of jelly and blanc-mange, and other dainties for a large party. Kit's mouth Avatered to get at these things. Often and often had he stolen the fruit from under a pie-crust, and sat silent while Jabez bore the blame, but now he meditated a more sAveeping raid. There was a fine young retriever in the yard. Watching Kezia out of the way, he crammed mouth and pockets with the pastry, and made an inroad into the trifle. Then he Avhistled to Nelson, raised the dog on his hind feet, and printed the forepaws on the pantry-shelf, dishes, and tart-tray, and round the button of the door. But he Avas compelled to Avait until bedtime to fairly enjoy his spoil, and then could not manage it unknown to his companion. Hoping to close the other's mouth literally and figuratively, he offered him a share, but Jabez told him he was not a receiver of stolen goods, and left him to digest that with his feast. It was a harder morsel than even Jabez knew. The next morning before breakfast they were in the Avarehouse, Avhen there Avas heard a terrible commotion in the yard. From the back windows Kezia was seen belabouring Nelson with a broomstick, her face redder than ordinary, Avhilst the poor beast Avhined piteously. Jabez ran doAvn to interpose, and the infuriated woman turned on him, then ran in her rage to fetch her mistress to witness"], [194, "The Manchester Man. 140 the damage done, and the footprints of the depredator, and to own that punishment Avas just. But as Mrs. Ashton ascended the Avarehouse stairs that afternoon, she heard Jabez and Kit loud in altercation, and before they were aware she possessed a clue to much that had gone before. Something Jabez had said was answered by a loud guffaw from Kit, and the words \u2014 \" Let them laugh that win, I call it a deuced good joke.\" \" And I call it cowardly and beast suffer for your greediness,\" dishonourable to let the poor Jabez answered, indignantly. \"Now don't you put in your oar, young yellow-skirt. I'll let no charity-boy hector over me,\" blustered Kit. Jabez put doAvn a bundle of umbrella whalebones he had on his shoulder, to confront the other, then counting ferules into dozens. Umbrellas used to have brass ferules, like elongated thimbles, on the sticks. \" Look you, Kit, I've borne many a scurvy trick of yours without saying a word, but I will not even give the sanction of silence to dishonesty, and will not see a noble animal ill-used to screen a coAvard.\" \" Won't you ? \" sneered Kit, \" then we'll see whose Avord Aveighs heaviest.\" Mrs. Ashton came into the room. \" Townley,\" said she, \" your feather henceforth,\" adding in those ferules counted ? Jackson Avord will not Aveigh doAvn a the same dignified tone, \" Are is waiting for them.\" No further notice was taken, on a firmer footing in house remarked to her husband, as dinner party \u2014 but Jabez soon found he stood and Avarehouse.

Mr. Chadwick felt it keenly, and, but that his more cautious and wealthy brother-in-law came to his help with hand as open as his snuff-box, his credit must have gone. His two eldest sons had gone from him, draAvn away by the phantom, \"Glory.\" One, Richard, was a midshipman upon Collingwood's ship; the other, Herbert, a lieutenant in the 72nd, or Manchester Volunteers, had departed Avith his regiment to fight in the Peninsula.

There was another hearth we have ere-while visited \u2014 a hearth which, thanks to Jabez and a feAV months' regular employment for the batting-rods and the tanner's plunger, was less poverty-"], [198, "Thb Manchester Man. 144 stricken than it had been\u2014 and where Hope had held out delusive banners to herald a soldier's return, only to furl them again for another march, before eye could meet eye, or lip meet lip. Thirteen years had come and gone since last Tom Hulme and Bessy Clegg had looked Avoefully upon each other \u2014 thirteen years of unrecorded trial and suffering\u2014 yet still they were apart. The home in which he had knoAvn her first, Tanner's Bridge, on Avhich he had first made love to her, had been swept aAvay to make room for Ducie Bridge and a new high-road ; and the best years of her womanhood were passing too. Would he ever come back Avhilst grey-haired Simon could bless their union ? Would he ever come back again? Tears fell on Bess's battin\u00bb and Simon had not one word of comfort to give her. Even Matt Cooper, Avho had long since resigned himself to his Avidowhood, A\\ras magnanimous enough to be sorry. The new war between the \"Corsican Vampire\" and allied Europe was fortunately of short duration ; but how much of carnage and misery Avas compressed into that campaign Avhich had its brilliant close at Waterloo ! In the onset of that terrible conflict, Herbert Chadwick and a cousin, fighting side by side, fell in a storm of grape-shot like green corn under an untimely shower of hail, and their blood went to fertilise the Belgian farmer's future crops of Avheat. Herbert Avas his father's favourite son. Not a mail-morning passed but the old man made one of the crowd hurrying down the narrow way called Market-street Lane to the Exchange, to catch a sight of whatever bulletins might be posted up; and, his own mind relieved, sent an apprentice from the Fountain Street warehouse with the words, \"All's well!\" to cheer up those at home.

He Avas carried by compassionate hands to the nearest house, that of John Shaw, the saddler. A merchant on 'Change (Mr. Aspinall) undertook to break the doubly-calamitous intelligence to Mrs. Chadwick. Dr. Hardie, Avhom the general excitement had drawn to the spot, was Avith him in an instant, his Avhite neckcloth was loosened, and, Avhipping out a lancet, the doctor bled him in the arm without delay. He rallied sufficiently to bear lifting into a carriage, kindly placed at the doctor's disposal to convey him home. Dr. Hull was already in waiting. All that their united skill could suggest was tried. His recovery was slow and imperfect ; he dragged his right leg after him ; he was paralysed for life. He was not a young man, and the supreme shock, coming as it did above a pressure of commercial difficulties, had been too much for him. It was an overwhelming disaster ; but in anxiety and active care for the stricken one, whose life was in imminent peril, the sharp edge of the keener stroke was blunted for Ellen and her mother. The Ashtons were, as ever, kind and thoughtful. \"William,\" said Mrs. Ashton, meditatively, to her husband over the tea-urn, the day after Mr. Chadwick's attack, \" we must not forget that if John is not related to us, Sarah [Mrs. Chadwick] and Ellen are. ' Blood is thicker than Avater,' and it will not do, for their sakes, to let John's business go to rack and ruin for want of supervision.\" \"Just so, just so,\" he replied, reflectively, taking his snuff-box out of his pocket mechanically, and putting it back again L"], [202, "The Manchester Man. 146 unopened, as contrary to tea-table propriety ; \" I have been thinking the same myself. I will go round to the warehouse to-morrow, and see how matters stand ; Ave must keep things ship-shape somehow till John is himself again.\" And he Avas as good as his word, though he had really never thought about it until prompted by his clear-headed wife. He had a habit of thus falling in with her suggestions, though had anyone hinted that he followed the lead of a Avoman, so much younger than himself, too, he Avould have rejected the imputation with scorn. With returning peace came joyful restorations to many homes, humble as Avell as lofty. Before the time of their extreme privation, before even Simon was out of work, he had taken one of the smallest of the garden plots on the higher ground on the opposite side of the Irk, and cultivated it in what little leisure he had, Bess giA'ing him a helping hand occasionally, and by the sale of penny posies to Sunday ramblers from the town, and herbs and salad to the market women in Smithy-door, he did his best to beat back the gaunt wolf when the wolf came. Bess had laid by her batting-wands, put a turf in the grate to kindle up a handful of cinders and slack to boil their supper-porridge, for, though autumn was striding on, they could not waste fuel on a mid-day fire ; Simon Avas away working in his garden whilst the daylight held, and she sat, as she frequently did now, on a low stool in front of the grate, her elbows on her knees, and her head on her hands, watching, in a kind of hazy dream, the red glow creeping through the heart of the turf, Avhen a footstep on the threshold caused her to turn round. Like a picture framed by the doorway, stood the tall figure of a bronzed soldier, with his left arm in a sling.

Sorrow and joy have alike their baptism of tears ! It was a glad sight for Simon to see them sitting with their hands locked in each other's, side by side on an old box, which served them for a seat \u2014 all Simon's lost furniture had not come back \u2014 silent from excess of happiness, yet radiant as though the glow of youth were returning in the Midsummer of their lives. In the roughest war-time the common requirements of life have to be satisfied, and peaceful trades and arts are of necessity carried on, albeit they flourish not. And the farther from the seat of war, and the less private interest is involved, the less business and household routine is infringed on. Thus Mr. Ashton, whose large capital had enabled him to bide the issues of the Continental and American stoppage of trade, and who had no nearer relatives in danger than his wife's nephews, pursued his way in comparative quiet. Indeed, he was an easy-going man, with much less vigour of character than his wife ; and she bore little resemblance to her own sister. So Ave may carry our readers away from the poorly-furnished room in a dreary Long-Millgate yard, leaving the re-united lovers to the enjoyment of the present and their reminiscences of the past, and look in upon the Ashtons in their cosy tea-room before Waterloo cast a black shadow over the family.

As a thorough business woman, Mrs. Ashton was punctuality itself. She expected her family to be punctual also. Five o'clock, the Manchester hour for tea, and no Augusta ! \"James!\" (to the footman), \"inquire for Miss Ashton; she is not kept in at school \u2014 it is a holiday.\" As the man retired, Augusta, in a white cambric frock heavy with tambour-work, tripped in at the door, her diaper pinafore not so clean as it might have been, her hands full of something which she set down on a side table. \" It is past five o'clock, Augusta ; Avhere have you been until now ?

He had gone home to his mother-earth, sober and silent for evermore. And Parson Brookes, left to his books and his pigeons, sent in his resignation, and the Grammar School knew him no more as a master. So tlie boys felt themselves free to take greater liberties with him than ever and kept his hot blood for ever on the simmer. As all these changes preceded the change which converted Jabez from a Blue-coat boy into Mr. Ashton's apprentice, so were they anterior to the changes wrought by war in the homes of the Chadwicks and the Cleggs \u2014 changes differing even more widely than did the two homes. Poverty had made sad havoc amongst Simon Clegg's household goods ; but Tom Hulme had not come home empty-handed, and soon their furniture came back, or was replaced, and the three rooms brightened up wonderfully.

Very little fresh wooing was necessary. To people Avho had been so stinted as they had been, in common Avith others, Tom's pension seemed more than it Avas ; and no sooner was he able to discard his sling than he talked of immediate marriage, and Avas AA'onderfully sanguine about obtaining work as soon as his left arm"], [216, "154 The Manchester Man. regained its old power \u2014 which it never did.

Mr. Gough would have taken him on as a timekeeper, but lack of penmanship Avas a barrier in the Avay. Lamenting this in the presence of Jabez, the youth offered to be his instructor ; and with the permission of Mr. Ashton, Avho granted leave of absence, set him copies and gave him lessons on Sunday afternoons, at first on an old slate, to save the cost of paper, which was dear. And then, at Mr. Ashton's suggestion, Jabez superadded arithmetic, thus keeping himself in practice, besides helping one dear to those who had helped him. Of course, a weekly or fortnightly lesson Avas not much ; but the disabled soldier Avas a persevering pupil, and brought a clear head and an eager desire to his task. The maintenance of a better home for Bess depended on it. About this time a matter occurred at the Ashtons' Avhich had a material influence on the fortunes of the Cleggs. Though the house of Mr. Ashton was in Mosley Street, the premises extended as far as Back Mosley Street, Avhere was the Avarehouse door. The workpeople entered at a side door under a gateway which led to the stable, gighouse, and courtyard between house and Avarehouse, guarded by the black retriever, Nelson. You may look in vain for house and Avarehouse now. A magnificent block of stone warehouses, having threefold frontage, occupies the site. More than once Jabez Clegg, frequently entrusted with outdoor business requiring promptitude and accuracy, came upon Kit Townley, and one or other of the tassel-makers or fringe weavers,"], [217, "The Manchester Man. 155 in close conference under the dim gateway at closing-time on Saturdays, or in the still darker doorway at the stairfoot of the workmen's entrance. The first time they mo\\red aside to let him pass, afterwards they separated hastily ; but not before Jabez, who had quick ears, caught the chink of money as it passed from one to the other. On the first of these occasions his attention AA'as barely arrested ; it Avas the repetition and the avoidance which struck him with its air of secrecy, and set him pondering Avhat business his fellow-apprentice could have Avith the hands out of proper place and time. He knew him to be not over-scrupulous. He had seen him at Knott Mill Fair and Dirt Fair (so called from its being held in muddy November), or at Kersal Moor Races, Avith more money to spend in pop, nuts, and gingerbread, shoAvs and merry-go-rounds, flying boats and flying boxes, fighting cocks and fighting men, than he could possibly have saved out of the sum his father alloAved him for pocket-money, even if he had been of the saving kind ; and, coupling all these things together, Jabez was far from satisfied. He AA'as aAvare that of late years stock-taking had been productive of much uneasiness to both Mr. and Mrs. Ashton. There Avere deficiencies of raw material in more than one department, for Avhich it was impossible to account, save that the quantity accredited to \" Avaste \" Avas far out of reasonable proportion. Mr. Ashton, suspecting systematic peculation or embezzlement (of Avhich many masters were complaining) had privately com municated with Joseph Nadin, the deputy constable, a gnarled graft from Bow Street, Avho bore the official character of extraordinary vigilance and smartness. He Avas supposed to set a Avatch on Avorkpeople and others, but nothing came to light. Perhaps he was too busy manufacturing political offences, or hunting down political offenders, to look after the interests of"], [218, "156 The Manchester Man. private manufacturers. Sure it is that silk, Avorsted, Avebs, and gingham once gone were not to be traced. Jabez Avas also aware that a shade rested on the establishment of which he was an item, and felt that it behoved him to clear it aAvay for his own sake, if possible. Since the discoA'ery of his faculty for design, much of his time had been occupied at a desk with pencils and colours, making patterns for the wood-turner, the mould-coverer, the tassel-maker, the fringe-Aveaver ; for bell-ropes, brace-webs, carpet and furniture bindings ; and although some of these things admitted but of little variety, there Avas plenty found for him to do. This Avas Avell-pleasing enough to Jabez, but the College officials, Avho never lose sight of the boys they apprentice, demurred. His indentures provided that he should learn small- Avare manufacturing in all its branches ; and pattern-designing, if part and parcel, Avas only one branch. Mr. Ashton was too just not to assent, and Jabez went to his active employment again. But he had a love for his new art, and an interest in his master's interest, which prompted him to say \u2014 \" If it would be all the same to you, sir, I could draw patterns before breakfast, or in the dinner-hour, or in an evening, if Kezia had someone else to Avait on her.\" The inevitable snuff-box came out, Mr. Ashton's head Avent first on one side, then on the other, as he took a long pinch before he answered. \" No, my lad, it won't be all the same to me, nor to you either,\" he said, at length, and Jabez began to look rueful. \"You're a lad of uncommon parts, and I'm Avilling enough to find them employment. But if you Avork extra hours, apprentice or no apprentice, you must have extra pay. So you see, Jabez, it won't be the same to either of us You shall have the little"], [219, "The Manchester Man. 157 room at the end of the lobby to yourself, and there you may earn all you can for your own friends and for me.\" \" Oh, thank you, master ! \" interjected Jabez, his thoughts flying at once to the old yard in Long Millgate. \" And let Kezia wait upon herself if there are no other idle folk about;\" concluded Mr. Ashton, and the business was settled. This was about the time Jabez first began to suspect Kit Townley of unfair dealing ; and being once more in frequent contact Avith him in the warehouse, he could not shut his eyes or his ears. Kit was then assistant putter-out in the fringe and tassel department, counted out the moulds, weighed out silk and worsted, and called out the quantities each hand took away, for a young booking-clerk to enter. Jabez Avas still in the brace and umbrella room, but there was a Avide door of communication between the two, and he had frequently to pass through the former Avith finished goods for the ware and show-rooms on the lower floors, and had to go cautiously past the large scale, lest he should tilt the beam Avith his ungainly burdens. Now and then it occurred to him that the bulk of silk or worsted in the scale was large in proportion to the weight, as called out by Kit Townley, and once he was moved to say \u2014 \"Is that balance true? or have you made a mistake, Townley?\" \" Mind your own business, Clegg, and don't hinder mine. Naught ails the scales, and I know better than make mistakes.\" \" Well, I only thought,\" persisted Jabez. \" I wish you'd think and keep those umbrellas clear of the beam. You're always thrutching past Avith great loads on your shoulder when I am Aveighing out,\" interrupted Kit, testily, and Jabez held his peace."], [220, "158 The Manchester Man. But if he went on his way quietly, he was equally observant, and saw the same thing happen again too often to be the result of accident. Moreover, from the window of the little room where he had a broad desk for designing, he saw Kit meet the same men and Avomen stealthily after hours under the opposite gateAvay. \"Kit,\" said he, one night, when they went to their attic, \"what do you meet Jackson, Bradley, and Mary Taylor under the gate way for so often ? \" Kit, arrested with his warehouse jacket half on and half of asked sharply \u2014 \" Who says I meet them under the gateAvay ? \" \" I say so. I have seen you myself.\" \" And Avhat if you have ? \" Kit retorted, snappishly. \" There's no harm in saying a civil word to poor folk that I know off.\" \"No harm, if that were all,\" returned Jabez, seriously, sitting down on the edge of his truckle-bed to take off his blue Avorsted stockings (knitted by himself), \" but I have seen them give you money.\" \"And what of that, you Blue-coat spy ? If they're kind enough to call at old mother Clowes' shop for toffy and humbugs for me, and give me the change back, what's that to you ? \" he blustered, coming up to Jabez Avith a defiant air. \" I know you've a sweet tooth, Townley,\" replied Jabez, unmoved, \" but I fear nothing half so good as Mrs. CloAves' toffy takes you there so stealthily.\" \" Perhaps, Mr. Wiseacre, you knoAv my business better than I do myself ? \" returned Kit, bold as brass, though he did begin to feel qualmish. \"Perhaps I do, for I suspect you of double-dealing, and I know what the end of that must be ; and I warn you that I"], [221, "The Manchester Man. 159 cannot stand by and see our good master robbed. I should be as bad as you if I did.\" Townley, enraged, struck at him, and there was a scuffle in the dark, the bit of candle in their horn lantern having burnt out. Kezia, Avho slept in the adjoining attic, rated them soundly the next morning for the disturbance they had made, threatening to tell Mrs. Ashton. Had she done so, inquiry would have followed. Jabez, troubled and perplexed, the very next Sunday consulted old Simon Clegg as to the course he should pursue, being alike unwilling to tell tales on suspicion, or to see his kind master wronged. \" Eh, lad,\" quoth Simon, rubbing down his knees as he sat, \" aw've manny a time bin i' just sich a ' strait atween tAvo ; ' but aw allus steered moi coorse by yon big book, and tha' mun do t' seame.

He professed to be very pious and very conscientious, but lamented that increasing years brought with it many ailments and infirmities, such, for instance, as headaches, dizziness, sudden weakness of the limbs, and attacks of spasms \u2014 for the cure of which he kept a bottle of peppermint in a corner cupboard. It was into this room Augusta used to come dancing, to coax old Christopher out of bits of waste leather, and other odds"], [222, "io6 The Manchester Man. and ends, for which only a child could find use. She was fond of cutting and snipping, and, with an eye to his own advantage, the cunning old fellow had taught her how to use the stamps, so that she might amuse herself by helping him. Then he bespoke her compassion for his aches and pains, and often, on holiday afternoons, Avas troubled with one or other ailment, which a pull at the bottle and a nap on the bundles of leather, or gingham, alone could relieve \u2014 \" if Miss Augusta Avould be so obleeging an' so koind as to stamp out a few tabs or straps for him, or count out umbrella ferules, or wheels, or handles,\" for him. And she, full of the superabundant energy of youth, did it, nothing loth ; though as her own years increased, and with them her ability to help, came a sharp sense that old Christopher Avas a hypocrite \u2014 knowledge she confided to Jabez one day, when the sanctimonious putter-out Avas resting his aching head and uncertain legs, as usual ; and in order to convince him, she dreAV a bottle of gin, not peppermint, from under a pile of white kid. Jabez, too, had been sorry for the old felloAv, and often added a good part of Christopher's Avork to his own, to relieve him. It Avas this fact Avhich brought both Christophers to book. The old cant Avas so grievously afflicted on the Monday afternoon, that Jabez, seeing him quite incapable of doing his Avork properly (he Avas putting out umbrellas), undertook to do it for him, though it was no business of his \u2014 and so Mrs. Ashton would haA'e told him, had she been there.

Yo'd best ax Mester Christopher that.\" \"I think I'd best ask Mrs. Ashton that, if she's in the Avarehouse,\" rejoined he, sending his scissors through the gingham at the proper place. \"Yo'd better not, or yo'n cut off yo'r nose to spite yo'r own feace;\" and the woman nodded her head knowingly. \"T'other 'prentice knows whatn weaste means, if thah dunnot ; an' manny's th' breet shillin' it's put in his breeches pocket, my lad.\" \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" said Jabez, Avhilst he was counting over the already bundled up whalebone, sticks, &c, to complete the umbrella fittings. \"As our mistress would say, 'We may live and learn.' \" He found the whalebone, ferrules, handles, leathers, wheels, were all in excess. An extra umbrella might be made from the superabundant materials. Thereupon he wakened Christopher to do his own work, simply remarking that he thought the bundles of sticks, &c, had been miscounted. \" Oh, no, Clegg, they're a' reet ; we're obleeged to put in moore fur fear some on 'em shouldn' split in makkin' oop,\" said old Christopher, cunningly, as if for his information. Jabez took no further notice then, but shouldering a great bundle of large umbrellas, carried them through the fringe room, and there noticed that, despite the caution he had given, his fellow-apprentice was dexteriously manipulating silk and scales to falsify the weights he called out.

From the Avindow of Jabez Clegg's little room, Kit ToAvnley Avas seen to receive payment from a fringe-Aveaver for his share of the spoil ; and then Nadin, who kneAv all about it quite well enough before, followed up the clue to a Avaste dealer's who bought at his own price workpeople's \" Avaste \" {i.e., warp, weft, silk, &c, remaining after Avork was completed), and found trades people willing enough to re-purchase, well knowing that commodities so varied, and so far below market value, were not honestly come by. Nadin, big and blustering when there was nothing to be gained by silence, Avas for hauling the whole lot off to prison \u2014 the two Kits, the waste dealer, and sundry workpeople \u2014 and the criminal code was a very terrible dispensation then. But Mr. Ashton was more merciful ; he was for milder measures. Besides, Mr. Townley was an old friend of his, and for the sake of the father he forbore to drag the son into a court of justice; and unless he prosecuted all, he could not prosecute any. The sight of Nadin and his rough men, in their red-cuffed, red-collared brown coats, with their staves and handcuffs ready for use, was sufficiently terrifying. The distress of old Mr. Townley Avas painful to witness. As for Kit himself, he seemed less conscious of his guilt than ashamed of being found out, openly declaring that he \" did no more than was customary',' and no more than old Christopher, who had led him into it, had done for years.

Think well you have escaped the New Bailey,\" (the Manchester and Salford prison). At that period the constable who apprehended a criminal received a bonus on each conviction, called \" blood-money,\" so large a proportion of felons were executed ; and Nadin, gruff and uncourteous even to his superiors, was disposed to resist Mr. Ashton's amiable \" interference Avith the course of justice.\" A liberal douceur from the elder Mr. Townley's Avell-stocked purse was potent to allay his zeal. His runners were dismissed, and his friend the Avaste-dealer had a longer lease. The clearance of rogues paved the way for honest men, besides suggesting measures to prevent like embezzlement in future. The Ashtons rightly thought that the best way to reward Jabez was to serve his friends. A situation as putter-out to the Aveavers was offered to Tom Hulme, Mr. Ashton having had his eye on him for some time, and old Simon, being sent for, went home delighted with commendations of Jabez, and the consciousness that the only barrier to Bess's marriage Avas noAV removed, and that through the foundling's instrumentality.

Matt Cooper had long been a grandfather, Molly and his three eldest boys having been married and settled. A brisk young butcher coming to the tannery with hides had met Martha, the other girl, bearing her father's dinner, and been so taken Avith her sharp, active gait, and saucy answers, that he proposed to transfer her to his shop beyond Ancoats Lane canal bridge, and to make his offer more palatable, suggested an amalgamation of the tAvo households, and to take the youngest lad \u2014 Matthew, aged fourteen \u2014 as his apprentice. So ardent and promising a loA'er was not to be despised. Martha did not say \"No,\" and Matt, beginning to stoop in the shoulders, rejoiced at the prospective haven for his declining years. It was arranged that they should be married along Avith Bess and Tom Hulme ; and so Matthew Cooper Avent Avith the Cleggs to church, not as a gallant bridegroom, but, more suitably, to give away a bride. And now, how shall I describe the scene at the Old Church on Easter Monday, to com'ey anything like an idea to modern readers, unacquainted with the locality, the period, and the habits of the people ? It must be borne in mind that registrars' offices did not exist ; that there Avas no marrying at dissenting chapels ; that few, if any, churches Avere licensed for the solemnisation ot matrimony ; and that the collegiate parish church of Manchester Avas the nucleus towards which the marriageable inhabitants of all the surrounding townships and villages turned at the most important epoch of their lives."], [231, "167 The Manchester man. The venerable pile (noAV being doctored by restorers) was set, as it were, in a ring-fence of old houses, Avith an inner ring of low Avail encircling the churchyard, Avhich, as grave-stones testified, had once extended to the very house steps. As I have elsewhere said, the path between this wall and the houses Avas known as Half Street, a portion of which, containing Mrs. Clowes' old shop, still remains ; and did I enumerate all the public-houses in this ring-fence which offered accommodation to wedding and christening parties, only a future generation of antiquaries would thank me ; and even they might doubt the facts set down in a Avork of fiction. Nevertheless, on Easter Monday not one of these hostelries had a spare foot of room. Every window and every door stood wide open. Men and women, gaily dressed as their own means or friendly Avardrobes would allow, Avent in and out, filled rooms and passages, leaned from the windoAvs with ribbons flying loose, or with pipes and ale-pots in their hands, calling to their friends below, Avhilst rival fiddlers (almost every party having its own) scraped away in anything but harmony. Horses and carts blocked up every avenue, and the churchyard itself was thronged with an excited crowd. Only the parties immediately interested were admitted into the sacred edifice, but to reach the doors they had to force their Avay, and could only return in couples through a dense avenue of humanity, amid a shower of jests, many not the most seemly. Bess Avore only a Avhite cambric gown, and a straAv bonnet crossed with white ribbon, both of which Mrs. Ashton had provided; but somewhere in Tom's Peninsular campaigns he had picked up a bright-coloured scarf, Avhich made her glorious to behold, and the envy of many a country bride. His old uniform had been kept for the occasion, and they looked grand together; but the quiet content on Bess's face Avas better than the grandeur."], [232, "168 The Manchester Man. Nat BradshaAV, the butcher-bridegroom, Avas of a jovial turn, and nothing Avould do but the Avhole double wedding-party, Jabez included, should turn into the Ring-o'-Bells to drink health and happiness to the brides, and give them spirit to go through the ceremony befittingly. Bess and Martha hung back blushing like peonies ; but Nathaniel Avas not to be gainsaid, and in they went ; and whilst the brides sipped, he quaffed, and pressed the others to do likewise. At length Jabez, Avho had been brought up temperately, cried out they would be too late \u2014 Parson Brookes had been gone into the church half-an-hour. There Avas a general rush from the room, and in the scramble to get first the party got separated; Matthew pulling his daughter along and leaving the bridegroom to follow. They elbowed their Avay into the church, and reached the choir just as Joshua pronounced the benediction over some twenty couples closely packed around the altar. Then there Avas a jostle and a scramble for \" first kisses,\" amidst which rose the rough voice of the chaplain. \" Noav clear out, clear out ! Do your kissing outside. There are other folks waiting to be wed. Do you think I want to be kept here all day tying up fools?\" That instalment of the married having been hustled away to sign the church books, Avith their attendant witnesses, Joshua called out impatiently to the waiting couples, amongst which Avere Bess and Tom \u2014 \"Come, come! How long do you mean to keep me standing here ? Do you intend to be married or not ? Oh ! it's thee, is it? [to Bess.] Well, thah's waited long enough. See that you make her a good husband [to Tom.] Kneel down here,\" and he placed them, not roughly, almost in the centre of the altar, pulling others to their knees beside them, with scant ceremony."], [233, "The Manchester Man. 169 \"What do you want here?\" in his harshest tones he asked a very youthful-looking couple. \" To be wed,\" was the prompt answer of the young man. \"Ugh!\" grunted the Parson, \"what's the world coming to? I used to marry men and women \u2014 now I marry children ! Here, you silly babies, take your places.\" Another file of candidates for matrimony being ranged (after some pushing and pulling) in pairs round the altar, Joshua took his book, and the service began. So long as it was general, all went tolerably smoothly \u2014 women and men alike Avere too bashful and confused to know much what was said, or Avhat they responded, and certainly they rarely looked in each other's faces. At length there Avas a slight stir and a whispering from the quarter where Matt Cooper stood beside his daughter. \"Silence there!\" roared Joshua, in a voice which set a row ot hearts in a flutter, and there was silence. But he had come to the troth-plight, and again the same commotion was apparent as he approached the Coopers. \"What's wrong here?\" he demanded, pausing before Martha, who was all in a tremble. \"Moi lass is waitin' fur her mon,\" answered Matthew from behind. \" Ugh ! I can't wait for laggards. Here, you [addressing Tom Hulme], answer for him. What's his name?\" [to Martha.] \"Nathaniel,\" she faltered. \"I, Nathaniel, take thee, Martha, to be my \" he Avent on, insisting on the response of Tom, Avho looked aghast at the prospect of marrying the Avrong woman, and being told \"to pair as they went out,\" as Joshua had summarily adjusted a like mistake heretofore ; or, Avhat was worse, of being saddled Avith two wives."], [234, "170 The Manchester Man. On imperturable Joshua Avent with the ceremony, bent on a marriage by proxy. His experience having taught him that Avomen of the working class, as a rule, took charge of their wedding-rings, he asked Martha for hers, which was duly produced, and without further ado he directed Tom Hulme to place it on Martha's finger, as he had previously put one on Bess's, and with the same formula. They had got as far as \"With this ring I thee wed,\" Avhen the missing bridegroom came in hot haste through the side door into the chancel, closely folloAved by Jabez, Avho had been in quest of him. He was flushed Avith ale and excitement, but was clear-headed enough to perceive what Avas going forward, and to the chaplain's chagrin, plucked the young woman back from the altar and his proxy, and the ring rolled to the ground. Then ensued an altercation between the butcher and Joshua Brookes, the latter insisting that Avhat was good enough for princes might be good enough for him, and refusing to go over the ceremony again. But an apparitor drew the tardy bridegroom aside, and Avhispered to him a few mollifying words, Avhilst Joshua concluded the ceremonial, and then hurried from the altar Avith hardly a look at either Jabez or Simon as he passed out of the chancel, chafed and angry. Another clergyman took his place, and in the next group Nat Bradshaw and the half-married Martha took theirs. The lost ring had a substitute provided by the clerk for such emergencies ; and this time they were as surely married as Bess and Tom had been. Jabez had found the truant bridegroom at the \" Ring-o'-Bells,\" oblivious of the flight of time, or of his party. The story having got Avind, there AA'as a general rush in their direction. \" Here's th' mon Avur too late to be Aved ! \" \u2014 \" Tak' care thi woife hasna two husbants ! \" \u2014 \" Hoo's getten two husbants o'ready !

EOPLE had been naturally san- guine that the conclusion of peace would inaugurate pros- perity, that commerce would flourish with the flourish of pens on the parchments of a treaty. But the war had been of too long continuance, too universal, too destructive of life and property and crops. When grounds lie unfilled for years ; Avhen swords reap har- vests that should have been left for the sickle; when cattle SAM BAMFORD'S COTTAGE. are slaughtered wholesale for unproductive soldiery, or for lack of provender ; Avhen orchards and vineyards Avhich have taken years to mature are given to the flames, there can be no sudden re-adjustment of commercial matters. Food products are the staple of trade, which is only a system of exchange facilitated by coin and paper. What could a food-producing continent, down-trod by the iron hoof of AA'ar, have to offer in exchange for our textile fabrics and hardware ?"], [237, "The Manchester Man. 173 Trade could not revive until there was food to sustain it. Yet the mass of the people in 18 16, still further impoverished by a deficient home harvest, imputed the evil to defective legislation, and the exclusion of foreign corn, save at famine prices, and discontent became universal. Strangely enough, the agricultural districts which the Corn Laws were supposed to protect, were the first to cry out against them, and to break out into riot \u2014 not Manchester, Oldham, Nottingham, and the manufacturing centres. This year closed on a popular demand for Parliamentary reform, but not a riotous one. Sunday schools had created readers on humble hearths, and William Cobbett supplied them with books and pamphlets bearing on their own rights and wrongs. They were read with avidity, and he became a poAver. He counselled peaceful persistence, not armed resistance. Hampden Clubs were formed all over the country, in which the political questions of the day were discussed with as much freedom as stringent law permitted. Public speakers and poets, of whom Samuel Bamford was one, arose from the ranks of the working classes ; and the men banded together under such leadership called themselves Radical Reformers, a title which soon degenerated into Radicals. The members of these rapidly-spreading clubs subscribed a penny a week each. Delegates were sent to meet and debate together; and on the 4th November, 1816, a large meeting was held in St. Peter's Field, Manchester (strangely enough, the site of the present Free Trade Hall), \"to take into consideration the distressed state of the country.\" Other meetings were held by the Reformers and their delegates; and on the 13th January, 18 17, their political opponents held a counter-meeting, to consider the \"necessity of adopting measures for the maintenance of the public peace;\" for certainly the"], [238, "The Manchester Man. 174 meeting of large masses of disaffected people, however peacefully disposed in the outset, and individually, becomes threatening in the aggregate. No one cares much for a grain of gunpowder ; but mass the grains into pounds, and the pounds into tons, and there is certainly need of precaution in dealing with it. Amongst the precautionary measures deemed necessary for the protection of the peace, and the suppression of seditious meetings, were the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, and the enrolment of the Manchester and Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry, under the command of Sir T. J. Trafford ; Laurence Aspinall, Ben Travis, and John Walmsley joining the corps. On the 24th of March \u2014 since known as Blanket Monday \u2014 a large number of men assembled in St. Peter's Field, Avith blankets upon their shoulders, with the openly-expressed design of walking to London, to lay their grievances before George, the Prince Regent, in person. The blankets Avere intended for coverlets on the Avayside beds Mother Earth alone Avould spread for them. The meeting Avas dispersed by military, the neAvly-formed Yeomanry distinguishing themselves by trapping a number of the Blanketeers who had prematurely set out, and who had not got farther than Stockport. This Avas the signal for widespread alarm, and for Joseph Nadin to prove his discrimination and vigilance by scenting out imaginary plots, and arresting suspected plotters, whom he tied together, handcuffed, ill-used, and hauled to prison, or before magistrates (whether for acquittal or conviction), for little other reason than the dangerous power given by the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. He was a big, blustering, overbearing fellow, with a large grizzled head, closely set on strong, broad shoulders, with overhanging brows drawn close, and a sallow skin ; and his officious zeal in arresting such persons as Samuel Bamford, the Aveaver-poet, Thomas Walker, and the amateur actors he had"], [239, "The Manchester man. 175 earlier laid hands on at a public-house in Ancoats Lane, laying to their charge plots Avhich had their origin in his OAvn brain, did more to embitter the people against their rulers than those dust-blinded rulers suspected. The Radical agitation reached its climax in 18 19, when our friend Jabez Avas a Avell-formed, well-favoured young man of twenty, high in the estimation of his master and mistress. Popular rights had found a fresh champion in Henry Hunt, the son of a well-descended Wiltshire yeoman, a man of gentlemanlike bearing and attire, agreeable features, mobile in expression, and dull grey eyes which lit like fiery stars Avhen in the fervour of his speech his soul shone out of them. \" Orator Hunt,\" as he was ironically dubbed by those who loved him not, was the very man to move the people as he himself was moved ; his energy and fervid eloquence carried his hearers with him, and as he was wont to lash himself to a fury which streaked his pale eyes Avith blood, and forced them forward in their sockets, no Avonder the Manchester magnates were afraid of his influence on the multitude, or that the Prince Regent should issue a proclamation against seditious meetings and Avritings, or the military drilling of the populace, then carried on with so fervid an orator to inflame them. When Henry Hunt made a public entry into Manchester, and attended the theatre the same evening, a disturbance ensued ; he was expelled, and the next evening the theatre was closed to preserve peace. Then a Watch-and-Ward, composed of the chief inhabitants, was established ; a meeting called by the Radicals was prohibited ; but that did not deter the calling of another on St. Peter's Field, on the 16th of August, when a couple of large waggons were boarded over to serve as temporary hustings, whence Orator Hunt from the midst of his friends might address the assembled multitude."], [240, "The Manchester Man. 176 Augusta Ashton had just passed her fifteenth birthday. She was slim, graceful, and tall beyond her age, and was surpassing lovely. She Avas still under Mrs. Broadbent's care, and went to school that morning as usual, other meetings having passed off quietly, and no apprehension of disorder being entertained until long after nine oclock. About that hour the people began to assemble from all quarters on the open ground near St. Peter's Church \u2014 not blood thirsty roughs, but men, Avomen, and children, drawn thither for a sight of a holiday spectacle. True, of the collective eighty thousand, though there were many thousands of earnest, thinking men who went to grapple with important questions, yet no such mighty gathering could be without its leaven of savagery and mischief. But those who went from the mills and the workshops, the hills and the valleys around Manchester, walking in procession, with bugles playing and gay banners flying, though they might look haggard, pinched and careworn, made no attempt to look deplorable, or excite compassion. They wore their Sunday suits and clean neckties ; and by the side of fustian and corduroy walked the coloured prints and stuffs of wives and sweethearts, Avho Avent as for a gala-day, to break the dull monotomy of their lives, and to serve as a guarantee of peaceable intention. Such at least was the main body, marshalled in Middleton by stalwart, stout-hearted Samuel Bamford, which passed in marching order, five abreast, down NeAvton Lane, through Oldham Street, skirted the Infirmary Gardens, and proceeded along Mosley Street, each leader with a sprig of peaceful laurel in his hat.

Thence Samuel Bamford observed that other leaders had been less temperate. There were to be seen black banners and placards inscribed Avith seditious mottoes and emblems: caps of liberty, skull and crossbones \" Bread or Blood,\" \" Liberty or Death,\" \" Equal Representation or Death ; \" this last Avith an obverse of clasped hands and heart, and the one Avord \" Love,\" but all of the same funereal black and white.

A Mrs. Fildes, arrayed in white, Avith a cap of liberty on her head, and a red cap borne on a pole before her, sat on the box-seat. It is said she had been hoisted there from the crowd. Be this as it may, she paid dearly for her temerity before the day was out.

All had been preconcerted, pre-arranged. From the early morning, magistrates had been sitting in conclave at the \"Star Inn,\" and chere Hugh Birley, a cotton spinner, Avas said to have regaled too freely the officers and men of his yeomanry corps, so soon to be let loose on the \"sAvinish multitude,\" as they called them.

But his apprentice had Avon upon him not only by his integrity and business qualifications, but by his manifest interest in the family he served, especially the daughter. Let me not be misunderstood. Augusta was the cynosure of Mr. Ashton's eyes ; the homage of the apprentice to the school-girl, he estimated as the homage of an apprentice merely, and was gratified thereby, but his imagination never travelled beyond. He found Jabez on a chintz-coA*ered couch in Mr. Mabbott's sitting-room, his arm bound tightly Avith a towel, through Avhich the blood Avould force its Avay. He Avas pale and exhausted from excessive haemorrhage, but seemed more concerned about the fate of the multitude outside than for his own. Ben Travis, discovering that no one had dared to venture in quest of a doctor, threw himself across his horse, which he found Avhere he had left it, and was off up Mosley Street and thence back to Piccadilly, intent on bringing either Dr. Hull or Dr. Hardie. His uniform Avas a protection, and so the doctors told him ; Dr. Hardie plainly saying that black cloth was not plate-armour, and that his friend, Avhosoever he might be, must Avait until the tumult had somewhat subsided. But Jabez was only a couple of hours without attention.

At New Cross tAvo of these guns (Avhich Avent rattling up Oldham Street, to the dismay of Augusta and the Chadwicks, as well as their neighbours) were posted, one with its hard iron mouth directed up Newton Lane, the other set to SAveep Ancoats Lane, not then so wide as at present. Nathaniel BradshaAv's butcher's shop Avas situated at the nar- rowest part of Ancoats Lane, a little beyond the canal bridge. The shutters had been closed precipitately on the first alarm, but Martha Bradshaw and her young brother Matthew opened the window of the room above, and had their heads stretched out to Avatch and question the white-faced people scurrying past in disorder, when Matt Cooper, Avho lived with his genial son-in-law, came hurriedly home for dinner. His route from the tannery lay in a straight line up Miller's Lane, past Shude Hill Pits, and the NeAV Cross, into Ancoats Lane, Avhere he crossed only just before the cannon lumbered up. His clogs had rattled as swiftly over the pavement as his stiffening, hide-bound, long legs Avould carry them, and observing the heads of Martha and Matthew advanced from the window, he waved his hand in gesticulation for them to AvithdraAv from a post so fraught with peril.

This harroAving event AA'as the last of the painful incidents of that fatal day coming Avithin the scope of this history, Avhich, isolated as they are, the Avriter knows to be true, even though they may not be chronicled elseAvhere. The streets grew silent and deserted, save by the military and medical men, as the day and the night advanced ; but within the houses of poor and rich there were loud complaints and groans, and murmurings, which did not sink to silence Avith the day that called them forth. The town Avas, as it were, in a state of siege ; and men of business, Avhether Tories or Radicals, alike felt the stoppage of"], [257, "The Manchester Man. 189 trade and commerce in their pockets, Avhether they felt the cruelty and injustice to the injured in their hearts or not. But chiefly those Avho had friends Avounded by design or accident in the melee Avere loud in their denunciation of the Avhole proceedings ; and of these neither Mr. Chadwick nor Mr. Ashton Avas the least prominent, even though the one was paralysed, and they Avere of contrary shades of politics, the former being what he himself called \"a staunch and true out-and-out Tory,\" the latter having a leaning towards Liberal \u2014 not to say Radical \u2014 opinions, and at county elections voting with the Whigs.

He Avas himself a peaceable man, a loyal subject, going quietly about his own business Avhen Jabez intercepted, to his OAvn hurt, the sabre destined for his grey head ; Matthew Cooper, his tenant's father-in-law, was as peaceable and Avell-disposed ; and, if so, might not the bulk of the so-called rebels have been the same ? In his gratitude to Jabez he denounced the mounted yeoman Avho had sabred him as \" a drunken, blood-thirsty miscreant,\" though in the hurry, excitement, and agitation attending his OAvn withdrawal from the press by Mr. Mabbott, he had failed to identify his pursuer Avith John Walmsley's dashing friend, and the exclamation of Ben Travis had not reached his ear in the confusion. Easy-going Mr. Ashton also seemed transformed by the event. He had certainly lost the valuable services of his apprentice for some time to come ; but that was the very least ingredient in the cup of his wrath. By faithful, intelligent service ; by per severing industry, by a thousand little actions Avhich had shown his interest in his employers, and his devotion to his old friends, Jabez had Avon a place in his master's esteem and affection no other apprentice of any grade had ever attained. And now that Jabez had risked the dangers of the soldier ridden streets to bear his beloved daughter to a place of safety, and had braved the storm of foot and horse, and fire and steel, to rescue his brother-in-law by endangering his own life or limbs, his admiration and gratitude rose to their highest, and in proportion his denunciation of an outrage Avhich called for such a sacrifice Avas strong and vehement \u2014 all the more that he sympathised Avith the objects of the meeting. When he and Simon Clegg (who had been drawn to the scene in his dinner-hour Avith others, like moths to a candle) picked up his cavalry friend, Robert Hindley, from amongst the"], [259, ""], [260, "STAR INN."], [261, "Thb Manchester Man. 191 building materials, and disengaged him from his dead horse, he could not refrain from telling the disabled Avarrior, with all a friend's frankness, that \" it served him right ! \" Open expression of private opinion on the conduct of rulers was dangerous at that period, as may be supposed ; but private opinion became public opinion, too strong and too universal to be put in fetters. Mr. Tyas, the Times reporter, had been taken prisoner on the hustings, and it Avas imagined that only a one-sided account \u2014 forwarded by the magistracy in justification of their conduct \u2014 would reach London. But other intelligent reporters Avere at large, the garbled statements sent to the Government press were confuted by the truth-telling narratives of Messrs. Archibald Prentice and John Edward Taylor, which appeared the following day, and roused the indignation of the realm. These statements being more than substantiated by the Times reporter on his liberation, national indignation rose to a ferment. This alarmed the Manchester magistrates ; a meeting was hurriedly arranged to take place on Thursday, the 19th (the third day from Peterloo), at the Police Station ; thence adjourned to the \" Star Inn \" in Deansgate ; and, as though the meeting had been a public one, resolutions were passed thanking magistrates and soldiers for their services on the previous Monday. Then Manchester rose, as it were, en masse, to vindicate its own honour, and reject participation in a disgraceful deed. \"A declaration,\" says one historian, \"was issued, protesting against the ' Star Inn ' resolutions, which, in the course of tAvo or three days, received close upon five thousand signatures,\" in obtaining which none were more active than Mr. Ashton and (despite his paralysis) Mr. Chadwick. Old Mrs. Clowes talked her customers into signing, and Parson Brookes was not idle. Mr. William Clough, Avhose old servant MattheAV Cooper had been shot"], [262, "The Manchester Man. 192 down at his OAvn door, gave the tanners a holiday, that they might influence their felloAvs ; and Simon Clegg, Tom Hulme, and Nathaniel BradshaAv seemed ubiquitous, they Avent to work with such determined zeal. They did not feel \"thankful\" to the magistrates for the blood shed on Peterloo Monday. Neither did the bulk of the inhabitants; and an energetic protest against the proceedings and representations of the magistracy A\\'as the result. To counteract this, the Prince Regent, through his mouthpiece, Lord Sidmouth, sent his thanks to the magistrates and the military leaders for \"their prompt, decisive, and efficient measures.\" But this, instead of calming, lashed the public mind to frenzy. Meetings to remonstrate with the Regent and to petition for inquiry Avere held in all the large towns, Sir Francis Burdett presiding at one held in Westminster. Subscriptions Avere also got up for the relief of such wounded and disabled persons as had crept into holes and corners to hide themselves and their Avounds from Nadin and his constabulary ; and here, too, William Ashton and William Clough Avorked hand-in-hand to bring relief to sufferers not in the Infirmary; and Parson Brookes, to the disgust of some of his clerical brethren, lent his aid in ferreting out the miserabies, if he did not ostentatiously flourish his subscription in their service ; and I rather think a certain \"J. S.\" in the subscription list represented the mite of the Grammar School head-master, but I could not take an affidavit on the subject. But Avhen the Avounded, as far as ascertained, amounted to six hundred, irrespective of the killed, subscriptions had need to be many and ample. Another token of the change in public sentiment was shoAvn in the satires and pasquinades Avhich appeared on the walls, or were distributed from hand to hand. Previously to Peterloo a set of anonymous verses in ridicule of the popular"], [263, "The Manchester Man. 193 leader had been distributed. They began and Avere headed as follows : \u2014 ORATOR HUNT.

Under its influence he revived for aAvhile ; but, as the blood gradually soaked through the towelling, he grew fainter, in spite of brandy, and by the time Ben Travis (who had surely kept the promise made in school-boy days) brought Dr. Huertley to his aid, he had lapsed into a stupor from which the manipulations of the surgeon barely aroused him. \" You should have tied a ligature tightly as possible round the arm above the Avound, first thing,\" said the surgeon, addressing those around him \u2014 \" a bit of tape, a strip of linen, a garter \u2014 any thing narrow to stop the haemorrhage.

The attention touched him to the heart ; the humble apprentice, feeling himself honoured, raised the lady's hand to his lips as gracefully and reA'erently as ever did knight of old romance. And then he Avould have closed his eyes for very weariness ; but a little soft, warm hand stole into his feeble one, and, thrilling through him, a faint tinge chased the deathly pallor from his face as Augusta's voice, full of commiseration, said apologetically, \" I had no idea, Jabez, that I Avas sending you into danger Avhen I asked you to look for Uncle Chadwick ; I am so sorry you haA'e been hurt.\" He held the little hand of his master's daughter for one or two delicious minutes, while he answered feebly, \" Never mind, Miss Ashton ; I Avas only too glad to be there in time ; \" and lapsed into so ethereal a dream as he released it, that the Ioav, broken, grateful thanks of Ellen Chadwick left but the impression on his mind that she Avas very much in earnest, and had called him Mr. Clegg.

Not that she Avas a simple school-girl, and ignorant of the power of beauty. She was pretty well as romantic as any girl of that romantic age Avho, being fifteen, looked a year older, and learned the art of fascination from the four-volume novels of the period. Mrs. Ashton herself subscribed to the fashionable circulating library of the toAvn, but she was somewhat choice in her reading, and had Miss Augusta stopped Avhere her mother did she would have done well. But it so happened that, after feasting on the wholesome peas her mother provided, she fell with avidity on husks obtained surreptitiously elseAvhere.

He had taken a liking to the lad from the first, paid very little deference to Mrs. Grundy, and gave Jabez credit for a stronger head than did his more cautious and philosophic lady.

He Avas not demon strative, but his heart swelled as he felt Avithin himself that all these little things were stepping stones upAvards ; and he mentally resolved to mount them fairly. He recognised that he was rising, and ere the week was out he found that others recognised it also. His blood-stained garments had been removed, whither he knew not, and he had to fall back on his grey frieze Sunday suit. Be sure he began to calculate the chances of getting a fresh one. As he was able to go out, he was employed on out-door business until his arm should regain its full vitality, and one of his errands was with a note to Mr. Chadwick's tailor, in King Street.

She was particularly fond of a good play, and as particularly careful of her own pocket. So she Avatched for such occasions as a special benefit or \"Bespeak ' night, to engage one of the dress-boxes, and take tickets for a select party of her pupils.

With the exception of the large side boxes, Avhich were partially on the stage, all these boxes were open to the view, having only a divisional barrier the height of the parapet, light iron pillars supporting the weight above. There Avere no chairs \u2014 only narrow, baize-covered benches, innocent of backs. And the theatre was lighted by sperm-oil lamps, those round the auditorium being suspended by cords over pulleys, so as to be loAvered for lighting, trimming, &c. But the glory of that theatre, of Avhich it was shorn at a later date, Avas its box lobby \u2014 a lofty, open promenade, Avide as a street, and long in proportion, for its one grand entrance was in Fountain Street, the other in Back Mosley Street.

Nods and smiles from friends in different quarters of the theatre greeted the component parts of Madame Broadbent's bevy of innocents, and smiles responded. Then rose the green curtain upon Edmund Kean's Othello and Mrs. M'Gibbon's Desdemona. The audience Avas enthralled.

Some of the officers laughed outright in the very face of the tragic Moor ; but Madame Broadbent was furious, all the more that she was bound to suppress her passion then and there.

It was very remiss on my part,\" he added, \" but, indeed, at the time I thought only of placing you beyond reach of"], [297, "The Manchester Man. 223 further insult ;\" and Augusta could hear him mutter between his teeth, \"The impertinent puppy!\" The distance even from Fountain Street was very inconsiderable, and they had reached the broad steps of the door in Mosley Street, and his hand Avas on the lion-headed knocker Avhen this ejaculation escaped him. Service from Jabez Avas so much a matter of course that Augusta regarded his care for herself, and his proffer to run back at her bidding, only in the light of apprentice-duty ; but that muttered exclamation spoke of smothered passion, and before James was roused from his doze in front of the far-aAvay kitchen fire by that peal on the knocker, and sleepily opened the door, she had added a caution as an addendum to her message to Madame Broadbent. \" I hope, Jabez, you are not going back to \u2014 to interfere or quarrel with Mr. Walmsley and the other officer. If they are not quite sober, you must remember they are gentlemen.\" \" I Avill forget nothing I should remember, Miss Ashton,\" said he, as James unclosed the door for her entrance, and he darted off, the emphasis she had laid on her closing Avords having stung him keenly Avith a sense of his social inferiority in her sight. \" She evidently thinks the apprentice College-boy has no right to raise his hand against gentility in uniform, how ever drunk or disorderly it may be,\" he thought, as he ran along, spurred by a manly desire to shoAv that it Avas not coAvardice which had caused him to leave his prostrate enemy in the hands of a deputy. He was not three minutes in reaching the box-entrance in Back Mosley Street ; but for all that, the short Avalk home, and the brief delay caused by sleepy-headed James, had given ample time to empty and close the theatre, from which more than half the audience had dispersed before they left. Even the oil"], [298, "The Manchester Man. 224 lamps over the doors Avere extinguished ; and though a few stragglers loitered about \u2014 the natural hangers-on to histrionic skirts \u2014 and there Avere braAvlers in the neighbourhood, he saAV none of those he Avent to seek. The fact Avas, Captain Travis had hauled Lieutenant Aspinall from the ground with little ceremony, and Avith a sharp reproof for \"the disgrace he Avas bringing on their corps by insulting a young lady in a public place, as if sufficient odium did not attach to the Yeomanry already,\" forced him into a Avaiting hackney-coach, giving the driver orders to bear him home to his father's house on ArdAvick Green, heedless of the young officer's remonstrance to the contrary. But Jehu, who kneAv his fare drove him instead to the \" George and Dragon \" on the opposite side of the Green, and Mr. Aspinall saw nothing of his hopeful son that night. Nor Avould Charlotte Walmsley have seen much more of her husband, had not kind-hearted Ben gone far out of his OAvn Avay to land John safely at home. Perhaps it Avould be hardly fair to calculate too nicely how far he Avas influenced to that by the relation of the Walmsleys to Ellen ChadAvick, since the secret springs of action often lie too far down even for self-knoAvledge. As for Madame Broadbent, no sooner had Miss Nuttall disposed of the last of the budding misses than she hid her indignation in the deep shadoAv of her large calesh, and with an access of importance, left the theatre, slightly in advance of her humble dependants, and made her fearless way through Fountain Street and High Street, Avith a step which augured unpleasantness for all beneath her roof if her supper Avere not done to a turn and served to a nicety. Augusta was someAvhat loth to leave her pillow in the morning, after the night's unusual dissipation, and Avas still more reluctant to encounter her lessons and Mrs. Broadbent ; and she for the"], [299, ""], [300, "X white hart, whaley bridge."], [301, "The Manchester Man. 225 first time remarked to Cicily that she thought she Avas \"quite too old to go to school.\" As if the world was not one huge school, Avherein the dunces get punished most severely, and even the best and brightest do not escape the rod. But Augusta Ashton, buoyant, blooming, cherished, admired, adored, could not see that her real schooling Avould begin when Madame Broadbent's reign ceased. No doubt Mr. Ashton would have been coaxed into granting an extension of his darling daughter's Easter holiday, and suffered her to remain at home that Thursday morning, but he was at Whaley-Bridge ; and mamma met her request with : \u2014 \" No, my dear, you have had quite holiday enough. It Avould be setting a bad example to infringe Madame Broadbent's rules. Go, my dear, and go cheerfully. I will send Cicily for you at noon. The streets will be rather rough this week.\" She Avent, though not cheerfully, and Cicily was duly despatched to bring her home ; but neither Cicily nor Miss Ashton had returned when dinner was put upon the table at half-past tAvelve o'clock. Then Mrs. Ashton recalled her OAvn words respecting the rough streets, and the insult offered as umvelcome tribute to Augusta's beauty over-night ; and, though by no means a nervous woman, the mother grew restless and apprehensive \u2014 a lovely daughter who is an only child is so very anxious a charge. As she sat down to her solitary meal, another thought crossed her mind. \"James, ask Mr. Clegg to oblige me by stepping this way.\" Mr. Clegg was Avith her in an instant : the summons was unusual. \"Jabez, I'll thank you to ascertain why Miss Ashton has not returned from school at the usual time. Cicily has been gone almost an hour. Should Madame be keeping her in for Q"], [302, "226 The Manchester Man. any breach of etiquette last night, pray offer an apology for me and my daughter also, but at the same time politely insist on Miss Ashton's immediate return to dinner.\" \" I believe I owe Madame Broadbent an apology myself,\" ansAvered Jabez, smiling. \" I shall be glad of an opportunity to discharge the debt.\" The schoolroom door Avas midAvay doAvn the dark, narrow, arched entry. Groups of girls, Avith slates and bags in their hands, loitering on the pathAvay at the entrance and in the passage, made Avay for him, Avith curious looks and Avhispers among themselves (Jabez was not unknown to some of the senior pupils). The schoolroom door stood ajar ; the Avhole place was in a commotion unprecedented in that precise establishment. Madame Broadbent, holding by the copy-slip axiom, \" Familiarity breeds contempt,\" preserved her dignity and that of her high office by avoiding personal contact Avith her pupils, save at stated hours. Her assistant-governesses were at their posts from nine until twelve, from two until four ; but Madame herself only sailed into the long room from the house door across the entry at eleven o'clock to receive reports, inspect work, dispense rewards, or administer reproof and chastisement. \"Spare the rod and spoil the child \" had not been abolished from the educational code fifty-five years back. The double shock her importance had received at the theatre sent her home to quarrel Avith her supper ; and, as a meal despatched in an ill-humour does not easily digest, Othello and the Castle Spectre haunted her pillow, and broke her rest with nightmares. She rose late, and stepped into her schoolroom later than usual, to visit her accumulation of disagreeables on minor delinquents, as well as on the primary offenders."], [303, "The Manchester Man. 227 Let us be just. Madame Broadbent had gracious smiles and approving words to dispense to the ultra-good, and their very rarity made them valuable. But if she rewarded any that day, it was only that severity might stand out in contrast. Little hearts beat, little fingers plied industrious needles, little eyes bent over work, when Madame's step was heard in the entry ; but when her august presence fairly filled the room, every little damsel rose simultaneously, and saluted her entrance with a low, formal, deferential curtsey. Two rooms had evidently been thrown into one to give required space, the back portion being curiously lit by a narroAV small-paned AvindoAv extending along the side, high above the rows of racks and pegs. It was the writing end of the room. Madame Broadbent occupied a seat in the front portion, almost opposite to the door ; and as she marched toAvards it with more than ordinary loftiness, and beat her fan on her table with one peremptory tap, instead of a short rapid quiver, to enforce her command, \"Attention, ladies!\" the very youngest of those ladies could interpret the signs portentously. Lucky was the young lady whose work passed muster that morning ; so many were condemned to stocks, backboard, columns of spelling, recitations from the \" Speaker \" and Thomson's \" Seasons,\" lengths of open hem, back stitching, or seaming ! At length Madame Broadbent, having dismissed ordinary business, rapped her fan upon the table, and, in a sharp, peremptory tone, called \" Miss Ashton ! \" \u2014 and Miss Ashton, who had been expecting the summons all the morning, came forward at her bidding, but not with the ordinary alacrity of pupilage. She had left her childhood (I had almost said her girlhood) behind her in the box-lobby of the Theatre Royal. \" Miss Brookes ! \" cried the same sharp voice ; and, with a painful start, the little girl Avho had committed such a terrible"], [304, "228 The Manchester Man. breach of decorum before a Avhole theatre as to utter her impromptu commentary on the tragedian's art, rose, trembled, burst into tears, but Avas too agitated to obey Avith sufficient promptitude. Her seat was on a Ioav front form. Madame took a step forward, stretched out her arm, and dragged the child by the ear to the side of Augusta, then gave her a smart cuff as an admonition to more prompt obedience another time. Then with another rap of her fan on the table, Avhich set all hearts palpitating, she began an inflated harangue to the mite of a child and the budding woman, in Avhich she reproached them both Avith bringing disgrace on the \" Academy,\" hitherto so irreproachable. The one had drawn the attention of a whole theatre to her ill-breeding and Avant of proper training ; the other by \" boldness of look and manner had licensed the free speech of loose men ; \" and, as if that Avere not enough, had \"been the cause of an unpardonable insult to herself.\" She, Madame Broadbent, so highly honoured and respected by the chief people in the tOAvn, to be called \" Mother Broadbent ! \" \u2014 it was an outrage not to be endured ! Her temper interrupted her oration ; she shook Augusta A'iolently, and condemned her to remain in school until she had learned one of Mrs. Chapone's letters by heart. Then she darted on the smaller Miss as the primary cause of all, shook her till the little teeth chattered, and dragged her by the lobe of the ear towards a dark closet, set apart for heinous offenders. Something akin to rebellion had been growing in Augusta's breast all the morning. She Avas a girl of quick impulses and sympathies, and was not only struck by the disproportion of punishment meted out, but by the terror on the little one's face. She threAv herself in their path, and to the utter astonish ment alike of pupils and teachers laid hold of the child to"], [305, "The Manchester Man. 229 release her, exclaiming as she did so, \"You shall not lock her in the dark ! you will kill her with fright, you cruel Madame Broadbent!\" If Madame Broadbent had been Avrathful before she was furious noAv. Never in her long experience had she been so braved. Without thought, Avithout premeditation, she raised her heavy fan and struck sharply at Augusta. The blow fell on her beautiful bare neck, the collar-bone snapped, as it will do Avith a very slight matter, and Augusta dropped ! Cicily, waiting outside at the time, heard Madame's raised voice and Augusta's impetuous remonstrance; then a thud, a fall, and a suppressed scream from the girls ; and Avithout pausing to knock, she pushed open the door. Cicily had been too long the recipient of Augusta's school-girl confidence to stand in much awe of Mrs. Broadbent at best of times. Now she darted forward to raise her young mistress, Avhom she almost Avorshipped, and certainly did not consult either Madame's feelings or dignity in the epithets she launched at her. No one had been more electrified at the effect of that stroke with the fan than Mrs. Broadbent's self. She seemed petrified, and Cicily's indignant outburst fell on deaf ears ; but as Miss Nuttall ran for water, and Cicily cried out for a doctor, she roused to self-consciousness, and closed the school-room door as if to keep the outer Avorld in ignorance of what was going on inside. A wide latitude was then alloAved for school discipline ; but even Madame Broadbent was sensible that the blow Avhich had felled Mr. Ashton's only daughter was a blow to imperil her seminary. Augusta did not revive. Miss Nuttall suggested that the school should be dismissed, and a doctor fetched ; and, before either could be effected, Jabez was on the spot. He took in"], [306, "The Manchester Man. 230 the scene at a glance ; Augusta, Avhite as her frock, her hair all in disorder, lay extended on a form, her head supported by the kneeling Cicily, Avhilst excited girls and teachers flocked helplessly around. \" Good heavens ! Avhat is the matter ? What has happened to Miss Ashton?\" was his hurried and agitated inquiry. One said one thing, one another. Wrathful Cicily came nearest to the mark. \"That old wretch has struck ar darlin' wi' her great fan. A'm afeared her neckbone's brokken ! \" \" Impossible ! She could not be so heartless ! \" he cried, as the group made Avay for him to pass, and he knelt down opposite to the sobbing Cicily, on the other side of the form, and sprinkled the pallid face so dear to him with Avater some one had brought in. There Avas no sign of revival. \" My God ! this is terrible ! Oh, madam, hoAv could you do it ? Mrs. Ashton will be distracted ! \" and he started to his feet, inexpressible anguish in every feature. \" But this is no time for revilings. Where is the nearest doctor?\" \" There is Mr. Campbell in Hanover Street \u2014 and \" Brushing unceremoniously past his informant, he was with the Scotch surgeon before Miss Nuttall had recovered from her surprise, or Madame from her stupor. Mr. Campbell Avas quickly on his Avay to attend this new patient, and Jabez speeding tOAvards the top of Market Street. There he hired a hackney coach from the stand, close as he Avas to home, and drove straight to Dr. Hull's. He bore the doctor from his unfinished dinner Avith impetuosity, brooking no delay. They found Augusta Ashton faint, pale, but restored to consciousness, in Madame's OAvn dingy parlour, where the author of the mischief was doing her best to put a favourable colour on the disaster."], [307, "CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIFTH RETROSPECTIVE. HE collar-bone Avas broken ; there was no mistake about that ; but Jabez, mindful of Mrs. Ashton's protracted anxiety, lingered no longer Avhere he Avould fain have remained than to see the surgeon prepare \u2014 under Dr. Hull's supervision \u2014 to reduce the fracture ; a delicate process, since to the collar- bone no splints can be applied. Augusta's affection for SEDAN CHAIR, her mother overcame her pain. \" You will be careful how you tell mamma, Jabez, I know ; do not frighten her more than you can help ; she will be so terribly distressed,\" faintly murmured she, as he again departed. With all his haste and care, so much time had been spent, Mrs. Ashton's fears had already conjured up all manner of evils, all, of course, wide of the mark. That something Avas Avrong she felt assured, and he found her dressing to follow her dilatory messengers. The stoppage of the coach and his evident"], [308, "the Manchester Man. 232 agitation Avere confirmatory ; but the absolute facts roused as much indignation as grief. Yet Mrs. Ashton never forgot herself; and though the waiting coach bore her to Bradshaw Street to add her maternal reproaches to the Avrathful utterances of Cicily, the rough rebukes of Dr. Hull, and the prickings of Madame Broadbent's own conscience, the natural dignity of her manner more overaAved and impressed the resentful schoolmistress than all which had gone before. She Avas as profuse in apologies as in extenuating pleas, but she Avas not prepared to combat Mrs. Ashton's proverbial argumentation. \"Facts are stubborn things, madam, and she who cannot govern herself is not fit to govern others.\" Neither coach-making nor road-making had reached the acme of perfection, and Augusta's removal home, Avithout the displacement of the bone, had to be considered. A sedan chair \u2014 one of the last in the town \u2014 was still kept for invalid use behind the Infirmary. Jabez was aware of this, and before Dr. Hull could make the suggestion, he had proposed to go for it, and was back Avith the black, brass-nailed sedan long before the doctors thought their patient fit to be removed. As the unfamiliar vehicle Avaited at the \" Academy \" door, it attracted the notice not only of neighbours and returning schoolgirls, but of passers-by, until Madame Broadbent was in a fever. The reputation of her school was at stake, and she felt that every extra moment that hand-carriage and wheel-carriage remained standing there, the bruit of the lamentable occurrence Avas spreading farther afield. There had been no cessation of afternoon school duties, albeit the teachers alone presided, and discipline was somewhat relaxed. But when patient, doctors, friends, and vehicles had gone their way, and the school Avas soon after dismissed, the harassed,"], [309, "The Manchester man. 233 agitated, and prescient disciplinarian surrendered herself to alternate fits of hysteria, passion, lamentation, and overweening assumption. That first outburst OA'er, the self-important dame stood on her \"right to maintain discipline,\" even when confronted by Mr. Ashton, no longer the easy-going, pleasant parent of a paying pupil, but the angry father of an injured only child, who had posted from Whaley Bridge on the first intelligence of the mischance, leaving his business incomplete. Not alone to the inmates of the house in Mosley Street was Augusta Ashton precious. Notwithstanding her sometime waywardness (the result of her father's over-indulgence), she had endeared herself, by her affectionate heart and winsome Avays, to a Avide circle of friends ; even Joshua Brookes Avas less grim with Augusta ; so no wonder Jabez Avas secretly devoted to her heart and soul. Great and general was the sympathy expressed on the occasion. Mrs. Chadwick and Ellen were with Mrs. Ashton before the afternoon Avas out, and at Augusta's eager desire her cousin remained behind, not only for companionship, but as chief nurse' an office for which Ellen had that peculiar fitness observable in some Avomen, coupled Avith the deftness and experience gained in long attendance on her father. And now, leaving Augusta in the hands of love and skill, with all that affection and wealth can lavish upon her in furtherance of recovery, let us step backwards to the previous September, Avhen Peterloo Avas fresh, and Jabez yet wore his left arm in a sling. Whaley Bridge has been mentioned more than once, for in that village, near the high road from Manchester to Buxton, Mr. Ashton possessed a Avater-mill on the picturesque banks of the river Goyt, which there divided the counties of Cheshire and"], [310, "The Manchester Man. 234 Derbyshire. It had been established in the previous century, together with another in the contiguous vale of Taxal, by a speculative ancestor of Mrs. Ashton, whose old hall was in the locality. The tAvo places had been chiefly colonised by his Avorkpeople, many of Avhom had been pauper apprentices from Manchester and Warrington. Besides the mill, Mr. Ashton OAvned the \" White Hart \" Inn, close to the bridge, Avhere the Buxton coaches stopped ; and Carr Cottage, a long, low, rough-cast building, nestling under the shadoAv of a fine old farmhouse which croAvned the elevated ridge of Yeardsley-cum-Whaley, lang-syne the Gothic stone Hall of the warlike Yeardsleys. From this farmhouse Carr Cottage was separated by a retired Avalk at the back, Avhich \u2014 itself a Avilderness of nettles, gave access to the cellarage and a clear well \u2014 led the adventurer away up the hill between the cottage grounds and the farmer's tall high-banked hedges, which almost overtopped the cottage roof. And on the left of the cottage (as viewed from the high road) spread the granaries, stabling, and farmyard, enclosed by remains of the ancient wall, and entered by a step or two through an ancient Gothic doonvay, over which ivy and honeysuckle clambered in luxurious rivalry. The cottage, which on each floor contained four capacious rooms in its length, was on the ground divided in the middle by a respectable lobby \u2014 the house-place and kitchen lying on the left, the parlours to the right as you entered. There were tAvo staircases, one at each end of the building, the one running upwards in the kitchen itself, the other from a small enclosed space at the back of a parlour, containing also a china closet door, and lit by a Ioav Avindow close to the foot of the staircase, Avhence it Avas possible to step out into the garden, unseen by anyone in the house. Othenvise, both chambers and parlours"], [311, "a H Z W in w OS 0. I \u00ab o -< H H O O OS OS <"], [312, ""], [313, "The Manchester Man. 235 had doors of communication from end to end of the building-. the tAvo middle chambers being only accessible through the others. The loAver Avindows in the front \u2014 at least, those of the large parlours \u2014 Avere brought close to the ground, and overlooked a charming landscape ; descending, at first suddenly, from the widespread flower garden (Avith its one great sycamore to the right of the cottage for shade), then Avith a gradual slope to a beanfield below, to a meadow crossed by a narrow rill ; then, after a wider stretch of grass, the alder and hazel fringe of a trout stream, skirting the high road, on the far side of which tall poplars waved, and in autumn shed their leaves in the wider waters of the Goyt fresh from the bridge, where the road bends. Rivulets, road, and river ran parallel. And from the road a broad wooden gate gave access (over a bridge across the trout stream) to a wide, steep avenue between trim hedges, rising to the level of the cottage, in itself as delightful a retreat as any wearied denizen of town could desire. To Mr. Ashton it was necessary as an adjunct to his factory; an occasional home for his family in the summer, a lodge for himself Avhen a visit of inspection was desirable. Hearing that the general discontent was spreading amongst his OAvn Avorkpeople at Whaley Bridge, Mr. Ashton, Avithout waiting for the stage coach, put himself into a long-skirted drab overcoat, with high collar and small double cape, ordered reluctant James to \"find another for Clegg,\" and having stoAved away a carpet bag and a case of pistols, lest they should be molested on the road, he mounted his high gig, Avith Jabez by his side, and set off to \"take the bull by the horns,\" as Mrs. Ashton had advised. Away they drove through the mild September air, up London Road (where houses had been growing in the years since Ave"], [314, "236 The Manchester Man. scanned it last) and past Ardwick Green Pond, where a dashing young buck, booted and spurred, lounged at the door of the quaint \" George and Dragon,\" and folloAved them curiously with his eyes ; yet not so swiftly but Jabez had time to recognise Avith accelerated pulse his former assailant, Laurence. Longsight, Burnage, Fallowfield left behind ; Stockport Bridge gained, they Avent Avalking by their horse's head up the steep hill, between frowning houses, to the \" Pack Horse \" in the Market Place, where the beast Avas baited, and the travellers dined at the same table, Jabez not for one moment forgetting the social distance betAveen his master and himself. Again seated, they quickly left the smoke-begrimed, higgledy piggledy mass of brick and mortar called 'Stockport' behind, and Avere aAvay on country roads, Avhere yelloAv leaves were bloAvn into their faces, where brown-faced, white-headed cottage children Avere stripping blackberries from the Avayside brambles, or ripe nuts from the luxuriant hazels which have since changed the very name of the Bullock Smithy, through Avhich they drove at a gallop, to Hazel Grove. It Avas a glorious treat for Jabez, Avas that drive, and Mr. Ashton, conversing with him as they Avent, Avas surprised to discover his love of Nature, and his knowledge of her secrets. This induced reminiscences of the early years of Jabez Avhen Simon took him pick-a-back into the fields on Sundays ; and Mr. Ashton led him on to dilate on his childhood among his first friends, until he had a closer insight into the young man's heart than in all the years he had served them. But the object of their journey had not been forgotten ; and at Disley, hearing Mr. Ashton remark that they Avere but three miles from Whaley Bridge, Jabez ventured to suggest \u2014 \"Do you not think, sir, as I am unknown in Whaley Bridge, I might make enquiries, and ascertain the feeling of the people"], [315, "The Manchester man. 237 better if I AA-ent on foot, having no apparent connection Avith you?\" \" That is a Avise thought of yours, young man. Just so. I will put you down at the next milestone. Here is a guinea for your expenses at the 'White Hart' But country people are inquisitiA'e ; Avhat do you propose to be ? \" \"Well, sir, I took the liberty to bring a sketch-book Avith me \u2014 I don't get many such opportunities \u2014 I could represent myself as an artist ; or I could cram my pockets with plants and roots as I Avent along, and say I was a botanist in search of specimens.\" \" Stick to the artist, Jabez ; our country botanists Avould soon floor you on their OAvn ground \u2014 they know more of plants than pencils, I'll warrant.\" And Mr. Ashton, handing the reins to Jabez, took a pinch of snuff on the strength of it Mr. Ashton, putting up the collar of his topcoat, drove direct to Carr, much to the surprise of his unprepared overlooker and wife, Avho had charge of the cottage. He said nothing of any companion ; and Jabez some twenty minutes later Avalked into the bar of the \" White Hart,\" dusty and weary, as if with long Avalking ; called for bread-and-cheese and ale ; intimated his intention to remain the night, if he could have a bed ; talked of the scenery, and led the host to tell of the best points for sketching. Professing fatigue, he kept his seat in the bar-parlour the remainder of the day. The sling, not yet wholly discarded, drew attention, as he expected it would. The incomers, eyeing him askance, talked politics before him, and finding him less glib than themselves, whispered that he Avas a refugee from Peterloo, and, to show their sympathy with the party to which he was supposed to belong, freely discussed the political aspect of the district before him. He Avas young, free Avith his money, and they were not reticent. He found that the overlooker had made himself, and his master"], [316, "238 The Manchester Man. through himself, obnoxious to his Aveavers, and that only prompt measures Avould prevent an outbreak. The next morning Mr. Ashton put his head into the inn, greeted \" Mr. Clegg \" as some one he was surprised to meet in so remote a spot, and invited him to Carr Cottage. Jabez accepted the invitation for the afternoon, saying he could not spare the morning. Under pretence of sketching, he took his way by the Goyt to the neighbourhood of the mill with pencils and sketch-book ; Avomen and children flocked inquisitively round him in their dinner-hour, and talked to him; then he rested in a Aveaver's cot, and when he found his way to Carr in the afternoon, and sat Avith Mr. Ashton for privacy under the dropping keys of the sycamore, he had brought with him the key to the prevailing discontent. Mr. Ashton listened, took an enormous quantity of snuff, dropped an occasional \" Just so,\" and, knowing the sore, set about healing it. He drove back to Manchester, leaving Jabez as his temporary deputy \u2014 high honour for so young a man \u2014 and the overlooker was required to render up his accounts. A fortnight later, as Jabez Avas midway up the avenue to Carr in the afternoon, he turned, hearing the blithe bugle of the coming Buxton coach, and Avatched its dashing progress along the road. To his astonishment it stopped at the gate. He himself reached the spot at a run. His eyes had not played him false. Simon Clegg, in his best clothes, Avas there on the box seat ; Tom Hulme and Bess and little Sim sat close behind him. Mr. Ashton Avas himself an inside passenger. In the bustle and confusion of alighting, and dragging boxes from the boot and from the top, curiosity Avas kept on the stretch. It was not until the entire party were under the roof of the cottage that Jabez Avas enlightened. Tom Hulme was the new overlooker,"], [317, "The Manchester Man. 239 Bess the neAV caretaker of Carr Cottage, which Avas henceforth their rural rent-free home ; and to Simon, long disqualified by rheumatism for the Avet and slush of the tannery, was given the charge of the garden, Avith a boy under him. And of all the group old Simon and little Sim Avere most delighted. Some eight months before, Sim (then about tAvo years old) had slipped on the frosty stones in the old Long Millgate Yard, and, rolling down its rugged declivity, was supposed to have injured his spine, and he had been too delicate ever since to run about freely. To the child, therefore, whose shoulders seemed unnaturally high, the change from the stifling court AAras something too exuberant for expression. To Simon Clegg, Avho, in losing his crony Matt, had felt the old haunts oppressive, the bountiful expanse of nature before him, and the comfortable fragrant home, were matters for deep thankfulness. \" Moi lad,\" said he to Jabez, Avhen the latter Avas about to depart with Mr. Ashton, after they were fairly inducted, \" ar Bess said thah Avould be \"a Godsend to us, an' thah has bin. This Paradise o' posies has o' grown eawt o' thy cradle. God bless thee!\" \" I think, my dear, the experiment will succeed. There is a matronly air of respectability about Mrs. Hulme that will help to uphold her husband's position amongst the Avorkpeople, and I can trust his soldierly discipline for keeping the rebellious in order.\" Thus said Mr. Ashton to his good lady, sitting by the fireside after supper, the night of his return home. Then, after a little pondering and trifling Avith his snuff-box, he added, as if reflectively \u2014 \" It is all very well, my dear, to serve the young man's friends and ourselves at the same time, but I should like to do something for Jabez himself. It is entirely to his clear head"], [318, "The Manchester Man 240 and his tact that Ave OAve the preservation of peace at Whaley Bridge. I should like to give him a rise.\" \" My dear William, make no more haste than good speed, and never do things in a hurry,\" replied his calm proverbial philosopher. \"We must not excite the envy of his fellow-clerks, or Ave shall surround him Avith enemies from the first. In removing his humble friends you have cleared one barrier to his advancement.\" Mr. Ashton did not say \"Just so!\" for a wonder; he turned his gold box round and round in his fingers, and at length gave utterance to a thought which took Mrs. Ashton by surprise. \" If Ave remove all the young man's old associations, don't you think Ave ought to provide him with neAV ones ? \" \" I think, William, we ought to ' leave well alone ; ' smooth paths are slippery paths. The young man will be out of his time in six months ; you can then adA-ance him if you think proper \u2014 in the Avarehouse \u2014 but I do not feel disposed to open our drawing-room to him, if that is what you are driving at ; \" and she drew herself up as if her dignity had received a blow. \"We-11, no \u2014 not exactly!\" and Mr. Ashton, unable to express Avhat he did mean exactly, shuffled and fidgeted till he upset his snuff on the Brussels, carpet."], [319, "CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH. ON THE PORTICO STEPS. BETWEEN that expedition to Whaley Bridge, with its terminal connubial conversation, and the breakage of Augusta Ashton's collar-bone, rather more than six months intervened \u2014 six months during which Mr. Clegg, as his good master had anticipated, felt the solitary state of his trim sitting-room someAvhat oppressive, the permission to receive his old friends becoming a nullity on their removal. He occupied a position midway betAveen parlour and kitchen \u2014 above his old associates of the porringers, the fireside settle, and the sanded stone floor, and beneath the family seated round the tea-urn on cushioned chairs and Brussels carpet. ToAvards the former he cast few backAvard looks of regret \u2014 he had put his past behind him \u2014 but, oh ! who shall tell his unuttered longings for the \"Open Sesame!\" to that paradise of Avhich he had had one rapturous glimpse, and one only \u2014 that paradise Avhere his master's daughter, so high above him, moved like a seraph, and filled the air with harmony ! I am afraid that at this time he brooded over his orphanhood and that unknown father who had disappeared so mysteriously, and strained his soaring thoughts in their flight tOAvards possibilities more than was good for him. He was too much alone for one of his years, and there were times in those long, candle-lit winter evenings when books and pencils dropped R"], [320, "The Manchester Man. 242 from his Avearied hands, and for lack of a companion he held dreamy converse with the fire. Of course his library Avas restricted, and there were no institutions in Manchester at that time Avhere young men of his class could meet for mutual improvement, or that mental polish caused by the attrition of mind upon mind. Occasionally, at long intervals, and at first to the utter confusion of James, Captain Travis had inquired for \" Mr. Clegg,\" and been shoAvn into the little sitting-room with a disregard to \" caste \" very creditable to both of them ; and now and then Mr. Chadwick and Mr. Ashton would drop in together for half-an-hour's chat, the gratitude of the former being deeper than the surface. But rarely did a feminine face save Cicily's brighten up his solitude, and she, devoted to her young mistress, had always something to say about Augusta, if only what she Avore or how she looked, Avhich sent him off into dreamland immediately. Sunday Avas a very chequered day ; when he missed his old friends most. True, he followed the family to church, perhaps carried Augusta's prayer-book, exchanged a word of kindly greeting with old Mrs. Clowes and Parson Brookes, who was not as hale as he had been ; but there Avas no old Simon to grip his hand, no Bess to give him a motherly smile, and unless the Aveather was fine enough for a ramble in the fields with Nelson for companion, the rest of the day Avas very dull indeed. The fan Avhich broke Augusta's collar-bone broke doAvn a barrier for Jabez. No personal sacrifice attended the service he rendered. He but went and came as an active messenger. But he Avent and came with intelligence and promptitude, and exercised for mother and daughter both the care and forethought of a much older man. In the father's absence the father Avas not missed. What came under Mrs. Ashton's own eye Mrs, Ashton could appreciate,"], [321, "The Manchester Man. 243 and the commendation of Dr. Hull was not without its weight. He had said \u2014 \" Capital fellow to send for a doctor, that messenger of yours, Mrs. Ashton ! A determined, persistent fellow ! Would see me and haul me off with only half a dinner, though I protested and he had already got a surgeon there before me !\" His thought about the sedan chair, which he had accompanied to Mosley Street to insure care on the part of the chair-men, and had ordered into the very lobby of the house, the cautious manner in which he had lifted Augusta thence and borne her to the ready couch, coupled with his protection of her daughter in the theatre the night before, weighed down the scale already trembling in the balance, and Mrs. Ashton's \" Jabez, I am deeply indebted to you,\" was not mere words. He was her messenger to the Chadwicks, her amanuensis to Mr. Ashton, and when Ellen and her mother arrived somewhere about tea-time for the second occasion he Avas invited to join their party ; and one, if not two, pair of cheeks burned as the invitation Avas given. Then, the night Mr. Ashton returned home, to find Augusta an invalid, he was gratified to see Jabez again at the tea-table, and after that at odd times, until the restraint upon him gradually wore away, and he would read to Augusta and Ellen, as the latter sat at work, and do his best to make the time pass pleasantly. Next Mr. Ashton took it into his head to teach him backgammon and cribbage, to help to make his OAvn evenings at home more lively. And Mrs. Chadwick, who for some occult reason had resisted her husband's desire to show courtesy to his preserver, could scarcely be less gracious than her grander sister, who owed him so much less ; so now the green-parlour door in Oldham Street was opened to him, and as Jabez refreshed his memory with"], [322, "The Manchester Man. 244 Hogarth's prints, he felt that he had made another step up the ladder. Those were halcyon days ; Avhile Augusta, too tall to be robust, recovered so slowly, and Avas so much gratified by his attempts to entertain her. Halcyon days for more .than one. Yet, ere Jabez Avas out of his apprenticeship, or Augusta had left her pilloAA^ed sofa, a pebble Avas throAvn into the stream Avhich broke the surface of the tranquil Avaters, and disturbed them for ever. Mr. Ashton was one of the original shareholders in the Portico, a classic stone building erected in 1806 as a library and reading room, on the other side of Mosley Street, Avhich, with its pillared facade and flight of steps, like an Ionic temple, looked doAvn on the plain red-brick front of the Assembly Rooms, though its opposite neighbour stood quite as high in repute, and was equally exclusive in its constitution. Mr. Aspinall, the Cannon Street cotton-merchant (who dined Avith the Scramble Club, instituted by business men Avhose homes were in the suburbs), Avas likewise a shareholder in the Portico ; and from constant meeting at the long tables Avithin the book-shelved, galleried walls of its lofty reading-room, he and Mr. Ashton had a tolerably lengthy acquaintance, although it had never ripened into intimacy \u2014 the men were so dissimilar. Charlotte Walmsley Avas naturally troubled by the result of Madame Broadbent's notions of discipline, and not unnaturally (considering the condition in Avhich Ben Travis had taken him home) blamed her husband as the primary cause. As naturally he shifted the onus to the shoulders of Laurence Aspinall, and, taking him to task, plainly told him he ought to apologise. Laurence snatched at the proposal. \" My dear Jack, nothing would please me better ! I'll make a thousand apologies, if you'll only introduce me.\""], [323, ""], [324, "BY THE PORTICO STEPS"], [325, "The Manchester Man. 245 John Walmsley had had quite enough of introductions ; besides, he stood in some awe of Mrs. Ashton, and did not know hoAv she might take it, especially as his friend Aspinall had acquired the character of a \" wild spark.\" He emphatically declined. But if Laurence Aspinall once set his mind on a thing he Avould attain it, if Avithin the range of possibility, Avhether by fair means or foul, Avhatever might be the con sequences. For a few days he was on his best behaviour at home ; and having won his father over by expressions of deep contrition, and promises of reformation, and the assurance that he Avould never again do anything \" unbecoming a gentleman,\" he prevailed on him to introduce him to Mr. Ashton, Avith a view to making his own apologies in person. \"Well, Laurence, you can go Avith me to the Portico to-morroAv morning, and if Mr. Ashton is there Ave will see Avhat can be done ; \" the tone in Avhich this Avas said clearly implying, \" If we seek an introduction to the Ashton's for the purpose of making the amende honorable as befits gentlemen, there can be no doubt of its acceptance. But Avhen they met Mr. Ashton on the steps of the Portico the folloAving morning, the self-complacence of the lofty gentleman received a slight but uncontemplated check. Mr. Ashton nodded to Mr. Aspinall with a beaming face, and Avould have passed his acquaintance Avith a mere \" Good morning,\" but the other stopped, and after shaking hands, and remarking that trade Avas slack, presented, Avith due formality, the handsome, elegant, six feet of dandyism Avho bore him company. \" Mr. Ashton, let me make you acquainted Avith my son, sir \u2014 Mr. Ashton, my son Laurence ; Laurence, Mr. Ashton.\" The young gentleman raised his stylish beaver from his rich coppery curls, and bowed Avith courtly grace in acknowledgment"], [326, "Thb Manchester Man. 246 of Mr. Ashton's formal boAv, Avhilst his father continued, almost in the tone of one who confers an honour \u2014 \"The fact is, my son, sir, desires an opportunity of expressing to Miss Ashton his deep regret for the indiscretion of which he Avas guilty in the lobby of the Theatre Royal, some ten days back.\" The smile faded from the face of Mr. Ashton, Avho, Avith a reserve very foreign to him, put his hand into his pocket for his snuff-box instead of extending it to the young man, and, tapping it with a little impatience, caught at his words. \" Indiscretion, sir ? What you are pleased to call ' indiscretion ' has placed my daughter in the doctor's hands with a broken collar-bone.\" Before Mr. Aspinall could reply, Laurence, better skilled to temporise, interposed. \"So, to my infinite regret, my friend Mr. Walmsley has already informed me, sir. And I assure you, I take shame to myself that any Avord or action of mine should have led to consequences so lamentable. No one, sir, can deplore the injury Miss Ashton has sustained, more than myself \u2014 the unhappy cause. It is this, Mr. Ashton, which impels me to seek an opportunity to express the sensibilty of my grave offence, and my extreme regret, to Mrs. Ashtcn and Miss Ashton in person. I cannot rest until I have implored their pardon !\" The tones in which this apolegetic speech was delivered were at once so suave, remorseful, and sympathetic that Mr. Ashton, whose sternness was seldom of long duration, was considerably mollified. He looked at the handsome, dashing blade before him, Avhose blue eyes seem full of gentleness and pity, and felt as though the boy he had seen torturing old Brookes, and the yeomanry officer who had slashed at Mr. Chadwick and Jabez Clegg, could never be one and the same. He reverted to the latter circumstance-^"], [327, "The Manchester man. 247 \" I think, young sir, you owe an apology to someone else under my roof \u2014 the young man who received the sabre-cut you designed for my brother-in-law, Mr. Chadwick.\" Aspinall's handsome face flushed. His father's quick reply gave him time to think. \"You surely, Mr. Ashton, would not expect my son to apologise to an apprentice-lad, a mere College-boy.\" \" Just so ! I Avould expect him to apologise to anyone he had injured, were it a beggar!\" Here the son interposed : \" My good sir, do not remind me of the horrors of that dreadful day ! I shudder when I recall it. We acted under orders, and I swear I Avas utterly unconscious and irresponsible for my actions throughout the whole affray.\" And Laurence seemed desirous to wash his hands of the responsibility. \" The fact is,\" said Mr. Aspinall, coming to his son's rescue, \" Laurence had taken more wine than his young head would stand on both occasions. It takes years to season a cask, you know, Mr. Ashton, and Ave must not be too hard on young fellows, if they slip sometimes. We have all had some wild oats to sow.\" This Avas a platitude of the period, but Mr. Ashton's \"Just so!\" was not a cordial assent; and Laurence, fearing the conversation was taking an unfortunate turn, led it back to its original request. But Mr. Ashton tapped his box, and, offering it to his interlocutors, took a pinch himself, and then a second, before he came to a decision. It was evidently a debatable question. \" I will mention your request to Mrs. Ashton, young gentleman, and if I find her agreeable to receive you, I can take you across with me to-morrow morning, provided you meet me here. Good day.\" Mr. Aspinall's \"Good day\" Avas someAvhat stiff. He had held his head very high all his life, metaphorically as well as physically,"], [328, "248 The Manchester Man. and Avas not disposed to be snubbed by one Avhose status he considered scarcely on a par with his own. He Avas disposed to look on his son's peccadilloes as some of those \" wild oats \" which young gentlemen of spirit Avere expected to sow, and considered his fine figure and beautiful features, his education, accomplishments, and prospects, passports to any society ; and that Mr. Ashton should for one moment hesitate to open his heart and his doors to his son, was an indignity not to be borne. \" The fact is, Laurence, that, if you make an apology to those people after this, you have less spirit than I take you to have!\" was his conclusion. \" Never you mind, father, I knoAv Avhat I'm about. I want to get my foot in there,\" ansAvered subtle Laurence. And he managed it. Mr. Ashton went home to dinner full of his conversation on the Portico steps, and set his romantic daughter's heart in a flutter by mooting the point at issue in her presence. \" Oh, papa ! do bring him ; I Avant to see him again, he is so handsome!\" \" ' Handsome is that handsome does,' Augusta,\" was Mrs. Ashton's commentary on that young lady's impulsive exclamation. \"Charlotte says he is very wild,\" remarked Ellen, \"and I feel as if I should shudder at the sight of him, after his conduct at Peterloo.\" \"You don't shudder when Captain Travis calls, and you don't shut the door in John Walmsley 's face, and they may have done things just as bad, if you did but know it, Ellen,\" retorted Augusta, standing on the defensive for the absent \" Adonis.\" \"Just so my dear, so they might,\" admitted Mr. Ashton, whilst Ellen held her peace, silenced by something in her cousin's retort. \"Yes, William, but look on the poor bandaged neck and shoulders of our child, and think of that ruffian's cruelty to"], [329, "The Manchester man. 249 Jabez and others when a schoolboy. I don't think either John Walmsley or Mr. Travis could have done anything so bad.\" \" Well, but, mamma,\" argued spoiled Augusta, \" Jabez forgave him ; and I think Madame Broadbent is more to blame than Mr. Aspinall \u2014 he only offered to bring me home.\" Mrs. Ashton shook her head as she rose from table. \" Besides, mamma, he says he only Avants to apologise, and you know you need not invite him again unless you like. It would be so rude to refuse. \"Just so, just so,\" assented Mr. Ashton, willing to humour his pet in her invalid state, and perhaps it might do the young fellow good to see the consequences of his folly. As usual, where Augusta enlisted her father on her side, Mrs. Ashton's dissent grew feebler. The next day Mr. Ashton made at least one false step in his life, and brought over his own threshold a blight. Faultless Avere the curves of the stylish hat, faultless the fit of pantaloons, and coat, and Hessian boots, and York-tan gloves ; graceful the figure they adorned ; graceful the apology tendered so adroitly \u2014 more to the mother than to the daughter \u2014 but if ever a graceless good-for-nothing cast a shadow on a good man's hearth, it was the Avolf in sheep's clothing whose hungry jaAvs were watering for the pet lamb of the fold, and Avho made so courtly an exit full in the sight of Jabez, as he crossed the end of the hall to his solitary dinner in his own room."], [330, "CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SEVENTH. MANHOOD. yOUNG as he was, Laurence Aspinall was wont to say he \" Avouldn't give a fig for any man Avho could not be anything in any society;\" and the Laurence Aspinall of the cock-pit, the ring, and the bar-parlour, was a very different being from the Laurence Aspinall of the Assembly or drawing-room. He could be a blackguard amongst blackguards, a gentleman amongst ladies. Nature had done much for him, art had done more. Nature had given him at twenty-one a symmetrical figure, and art an easy carriage. Nature had given him the clear pink-and-white complexion which so often accompanies ruddy hair, and art had trained his early groAvth of Avhisker to counteract effeminacy of skin. Nature had given him a lofty forehead, art had clustered his bronze curls so as to hide how much that brow receded. Nature had given an aquiline nose, eyes of purest azure, flexile lips with curves like Cupid's bow ; and art had taught that eyes set so close, whose hue AA'as so apt to change as temper swayed him, and lips so cruelly thin, might be tutored to obey volition, and contradict themselves, if so their owner willed. To croAvn all, Nature had gifted him Avith a flexible voice, and art had set it to music. The Liverpool schoolmaster had obeyed Mr. Aspinall's instruc tions to the letter; all that education and accomplishments could"], [331, "The Manchester Man. 251 do to polish and refine the physical man into the gentleman, as the word was then understood, had been done for him ; but under the stucco was the rough brickwork Bob the groom had heaped together, and which no trained or loving hand had removed. Be sure Laurence Aspinall did not carry this analysis into society, written on his forehead. Instead, he had cultivated the art of fascination ; and in the brief space occupied by that apologetic introductory visit in Mosley Street, he not only contrived to dazzle the romance-beclouded eyes of Augusta, but, what was almost as much to his purpose, to win over Mr. Ashton, and to weaken the prejudice of Miss Augusta's less pliant mamma. Ellen Chadwick was the only one on whom he made no impression, the only one who retained a previous opinion \u2014 confirmed. Possibly, as Charlotte Walmsley's sister, she knew something of his life below the surface, and had imbibed that sister's notion that he \"led John Walmsley away.\" Possibly, too, as Charles Chadwick's daughter, she contrasted the silken speech of the draAving-room dandy with the hectoring, sword-in hand, yeomanry cavalry lieutenant who, in striking at her father, had wounded Jabez, his deliverer, instead. At all events, she met the enthusiastic admiration of Augusta after his departure, the gratified encomiums of her uncle, and the more subdued approbation of her aunt, Avith the unvarying expression, \" He would have murdered my dear father but for Jabez Clegg, and Mr. Clegg is Avorth a hundred of him.\" Mr. Laurence kneAv better than to presume on that introduction all at once. From their gardens and greenhouses at Ardwick and Fallowfield, he sent small baskets of early floAvers and fruit to Mrs. Ashton, for her daughter, Avith courteous inquiries ; but he allowed several days to elapse before he presented himself in person, and then his call was of the briefest."], [332, "The Manchester Man 252 He kneAv he had prejudice to overcome, and worked his Avay gradually. MeanAvhile Augusta progressed favourably ; and if Aspinall grew in favour Avith the family, so did Jabez. May, SAveet-scented month of promise, brought to Jabez Clegg in 1820 his natural and legal heritage \u2014 manhood and manhood's freedom. He Avas no longer an apprentice bound to a master by the will of others. He had a right to think and act for himself, subject only to the laAvs of God and of the realm. True, that free agency brought with it a train of responsibilities, but the new man Avas not the one to overlook or ignore the fact. He had thought long and keenly of the coming change, and all it might involve, months before it came. His fixed Avages as an indoor apprentice, according to indenture, Avere no great matter ; but, supplemented by coin he extracted from his paint-box after business hours, he had found a margin for saving, besides contributing to the humble Avants ol his early fosterers. The latter duty he had never neglected, but Simon was as sternly just as the lad had been gratefully generous, and, even when poverty bit the hardest, would never accept the Avhole of his earnings. \" Si thi, Jabez, if thah dunnot keep summat fur thisel' to put by fur a nest-egg, thah'll ne'er see the good o' thi OAvn earnin's, an' thah'll lose heart in toime,\" the old tanner had been Avont to say, Avhen sturdily limiting the extent to Avhich his foster-son should open his small purse. So Jabez, leading a steady, industrious life, spending little on personal gratification, save what he invested in books, had quite a little store laid by \u2014 the result of very small savings \u2014 against the time Avhen he might have to shift for himself. Two things had troubled him \u2014 the possibility of having to find a situation elseAvhere (Mr. Ashton having said no Avord of retaining him, though, on the contrary, he had said nothing of his removal),"], [333, "The Manchester man. 253 and the necessity for quitting the house Avhich had been to him a home so long that even the grumbling cook and the affectionate dog had Avelded themselves into his daily life, how much more the kind master and mistress, and that beatific vision, their beautiful, bewitching daughter, Avho had held him in vassalage from the very day of his apprenticeship, and tyrannised over him as only a wayward, spoiled beauty \u2014 child or Avoman \u2014 could. The bright morning of the fifth of May set this at rest. He was called into the inner counting-house, and passed the high stools of inquisitive-eyed, quill-driving clerks, with a palpitating heart, conscious how much depended on the issue of that interview. As he opened the curtained glass door, to his surprise he found himself confronted by, not only Mr. Ashton, but Mr. Chadwick, and Simon Clegg, who had been brought from Whaley Bridge for the occasion. Business men, as a rule, are not demonstrative over business, and, after the first salutations and surprised greetings, the congratulations of the day were soon said, and the stereotyped \" And now to business \" put sentiment to flight. And yet not entirely so, as will be seen. There was nothing luxurious in that counting-house of the past. Besides the high desk and stool, it contained an oilcloth-topped hexagon table, Avith a deep rim of partitioned drawers, three wooden chairs, a sort of fireguard fender, and a poker ; but there Avas neither carpet nor oilcloth on the floor, and the Avails had but a dim recollection of paint. Mr. Ashton, snuff-box in hand, occupied one of these chairs ; Mr. Chadwick, resting hands and chin on a stout Avalking-stick, another ; the third, a little apart, had been assigned to old Simon, now on the shady side of seventy). Jabez remained standing."], [334, "The Manchester Man. 254 Mr. Ashton, as Avas his manner, tapping his fingers on his snuff-box lid whilst he spoke, opened fire, \" No doubt, Jabez, you have been expecting me to say something respecting your prospects and position when your indentures are given up ? \" \" Well, sir,\" ansAvered Jabez Avith a frank smile, \" I believe I have.\" \" Just so ! I knew you Avould. It Avas but likely. And I should have spoken to you some time since, but for brother Chadwick here. Both Mrs. Ashton and myself have Avatched your conduct and progress, during the whole term of your apprentice ship, Avith entire satisfaction.\" Here a pinch of snuff emphasised the sentence, and both Simon and Jabez felt their cheeks begin to glow. \"You have been unusually steady and persevering \u2014 have not been merely obedient, but obliging, and your rectitude does full credit to the ' honourable ' name Parson Brookes gave to you.\" This was quite a long speech for Mr. Ashton ; he paused to take breath ; and old Simon, proud of the young man as if he had been his OAvn son, seeling the encomium as some sort of halo round his OAvn grey head, exclaimed \u2014 \"Aw'm downreet preawd to yer [hear] yo' say it, sir. It'll mak' ar Bess's heart leap wi' joy.\" But Jabez, blushing, half ashamed of hearing his own praises rung out as from a belfry, could only stammer forth \u2014 \" I've endeavoured to do my duty, that is all, sir.' \"A \u2014 11!\" interjected Mr. Chadwick, in his imperfect speech, \" Nelson sa \u2014 said du \u2014 u \u2014 ty was all Engla \u2014 and expected of ev \u2014 ev'ry man, but it w \u2014 won the b \u2014 battle of Tr \u2014 Trafalgar ! \" \"Duty Avins the battle of life, brother,\" put in Mrs. Ashton, who had quietly entered the counting-house by the door behind Jabez."], [335, "Thb Manchester Man. 255 \"Just so, just so!\" assented Mr. Ashton, as he rose and handed his chair to the lady whose stately presence seemed to fill the room ; \" and Jabez has only to continue doing his duty to Avin his battle of life, I take it. But to our business. \u2014 You have hitherto served us well, Jabez, in the Avarehouse and out of it ; you have been doubly useful to me as a designer and as a detector of the roguery and mismanagement of others. Then, to my daughter, who is far dearer than either warehouse or trade, you have rendered more than one service.\" \"Oh, sir, do not name it, I beg. It has been my highest pleasure to serve Miss Ashton \u2014 or yourself,\" Jabez exclaimed, the two last words rising to his lips simultaneously Avith the thought that his sudden outburst might fail of appreciation by Miss Ashton's wealthy relatives. \"Just so! but I must name it, Jabez, as a reason for my proposal to retain you in my employ, and for assigning to you a situation and salary higher than is usually accorded to an apprentice just out of his time. But as you have shown stability and judgment beyond your years, and I know you to be honourable in all respects, I feel I am justified in making the offer.\" Mr. Ashton then stated, Avith a little seasoning of snuff, the salary he proposed to give the young man, and the duties he required as an equivalent, if Jabez accepted his proposition. The eyes of Jabez sparkled and his cheeks glowed. As for Simon, he seemed dumb with delight and astonishment at the good fortune of the foundling. \"If!\" cried Jabez, \"there can be no 'if,' sir; you overpower me with an offer so far above my deserts. I accept it most gratefu \" \"Stay, Mr. Clegg,\" interrupted Mrs. Ashton, as Mr. ChadAvick raised his head from its rest on his hands and stick, and made an ineffectual effort to speak. \"'Think tAvice before you speak once,' my bro \""], [336, "256 The Manchester Man. \" Oh, madam ! there is no need,\" Jabez began, but she silenced him Avith a mere gesture of her raised hand ; and Mrs. Ashton, acting as interpreter for her sloAv-tongued brother-in-law, resumed \u2014 \" You have done us some services, Mr. Clegg, but ' a man will give all he possesses for his life,' and Mr. Chadwick feels that his debt to you is greater than ours.\" Jabez looked from one to another, bewildered. Mr. Ashton took up the thread \u2014 \" Just so ! and that brings me to the point Ave have been driving at. You see, Jabez, Mr. ChadAvick is not so capable of managing his business as he used to be ; things go wrong he scarcely knoAvs how, and he is desirous to bring some one into his Avarehouse on Avhom he can rely. He therefore offers to take you at a higher salary than I think at all suitable for so young a man, and if you prove your competence to take the management within a reasonable time, to give it over into your hands, and ultimately \u2014 it may be in a very feAV years \u2014 to give you a small partnership interest in the concern.\" It is difficult to say whether Jabez or Simon Avas the most completely stunned. \" You must not look on this altogether as a testimony to your business qualifications, Jabez, I think,\" continued Mr. Ashton, \"but as the outfloAv of a grateful heart, and the proposition of a man Avho has no son capable of keeping his trade together. Is not that so?\" turning to Mr. Chadwick. \" Cer \u2014 certainly !\" Jabez looked from one to another, then to Simon, but no help was forthcoming from that quarter. Mrs. Ashton came to his relief : \" I think, Mr. Clegg, you had better ' look before you leap.' Whatever decision you make Avill equally satisfy us. But I see you need time to consider."], [337, "The Manchester man. 257 Suppose you consult your foster-father, and give Mr Ashton your decision at the outcome-supper to-night.\" The hesitation of Jabez was only momentary. We are told that all the marvels and glories of Paradise were revealed to Mahomet before a single drop of water had time to Aoav from a pitcher OA^erturned in his upward flight ; and even whilst Mrs. Ashton spoke, Jabez had time to think. \"Thank you, madam,\" said he, \"but I need no deliberation. I knoAv not for whose kindness to be most grateful ; but I do knoAv that I should be most ungrateful if I were to quit the master and mistress to whom both myself and my dear friends owe so very much for the first tempting offer made to me. Mr. Chadwick overrates my service ; Mr. Mabbott rendered quite as efficient aid ; besides, I have no acquaintance with the manufacture of piece-goods, and have no right to take advantage of Mr. ChadAvick's extreme generosity, knoAving my OAvn disqualifications. And, pardon my saying so, if Mr. ChadAvick has no mercantile son, he may some day have a son-in-law better fitted in every way for the office and promise held out to me. I trust, Mr. ChadAvick, you will not consider me ungracious in declining your liberal offer, but, indeed, I have been trained to the smallware manufacture, and here lies my duty, for here I feel I may be able to render something of a quid pro quo'.' Before anyone had time for reply, the Infirmary clock struck tAvelve, and, as if simultaneously, there was a rush from the warehouse into the yard, an outcry and a din, as if Babel had broken loose, the sacred precincts of the counting-house Avas invaded, and Jabez was carried off vi et armis. s"], [338, "CHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH ONCE IN A LIFE.

The last outcome, I remember, was quite tame beside this.\""], [340, "260 The Manchester man. \" Well, Augusta,\" answered Ellen, \" I believe he deserves it. I know my father thinks there is not such another young man as Mr. Clegg in all Manchester.\" \"Yes, he's very kind, and obliging, and clever, and persevering, and all that, and I like him very Avell ; but then you knoAv, Ellen, he is not a gentleman, and he is not handsome by any means,\" responded Augusta, in quite a patronising tone. Ellen looked grave. \" He is all that is good and noble, if he was not born a gentleman ; and / think him handsome. He has a frank, open, expressive countenance, and a good figure, and good manners, and what more Avould you have?\" Augusta turned her head sharply, and looked up archly in her cousin's face. \" It's well Captain Travis does not hear you, Ellen, or he might be jealous of the prentice-knight,\" she said, banteringly. Ellen coloured painfully. \"When shall I make you understand that Mr. Travis is nothing to me?\" asked she. \" When my cousin makes me understand that she is nothing to Mr. Travis,\" AA'as the quick reply, as Jabez Avas being borne past for the last time, and the young ladies once more waved their handkerchiefs in salutation. It may be very gratifying and very triumphant to be borne aloft on other men's shoulders, but it is neither dignified, nor graceful, nor comfortable ; and Jabez, being carried off bare-headed, had neither hat nor cap to Avave in return. He made the best use of his right hand, his left being required to steady himself, yet I am afraid he Avas more desirous to make a good impression on the romantic young lady muffled in a shawl \u2014 to hide the SAvathing bandages \u2014 than on his less-attractive and elder champion by her side."], [341, "Thb Manchester man. 261 It was half-past twelve ; the dinner-bell rang, Jabez was lowered to terra firma, and there Avas a general rush to the packing-room, which had been cleared out to receive tressels and planks for the tables, and an abundant supply of cold meat, cheese, bread, and ale, provided by the master. And then and there, before a mouthful was cut, Mr. Ashton, standing at the head of the table, having Mr. Chadwick by his side, and Simon Clegg close at hand, presented Jabez Avith his indentures, with many expressions of his good will and his good opinion, and an intimation to those assembled that Mr. Clegg would in all probability continue in his employ, an announcement which was received with loud acclaim ; and the hungry operatives set to at the collation with right good will. This was the master's feast ; that of the apprentice, for which it was customary to save up long in advance, was at night, and held at the neighbouring \" Concert-Hall Tavern \" in York Street, opposite to the then \" Gentleman's Concert-Hall.\" Prior to that, however, Mrs. Ashton had someAvhat to say to the young man, and she chose his OAvn sitting-room to say it in. Of course, his apprenticeship over, it behoved him to shift his quarters ; and he had looked forward to his abdication Avith regret undreamed of by Mrs. Ashton, or she would certainly have hesitated ere she made the proposal she did. As it was, she kindly and thoughtfully considered that Jabez had no good parental home to return to; that she had no other use for the rooms he occupied, so she proposed to him that he should continue to occupy them whilst he thought fit, since he had elected to remain in their service. He had already looked at lodgings in Charlotte Street, close at hand ; but this unexpected proposal came like a reprieve to an exile, and he was as prompt in his acceptance as he had been in that previous decision which had so thoroughly SAvamped all"], [342, "262 The Manchester Man. Mr. Chadwick's plans for his advancement. His eager \"Oh, madam, you cannot mean it ! You overwhelm me with kindness. Remain under this roof! It is a privilege I had not anticipated, and I shall be proud to embrace it !\" sent Mrs. Ashton aAvay Avell pleased. It Avas doubly satisfactory to find the comforts of their home appreciated after seven years' experience, and to be able to refute Mr. Ashton's theory that \"all young men like to shake a loose leg, and Jabez Avould be too glad to escape from grumbling Kezia's jurisdiction to accept the offer.\" Mr. Ashton, hoAvever, did not abandon the opinion he had formed. \" I'll Avager my gold snuff-box against a button-mould,\" asserted he, \" that Clegg only said ' Yes ' because gratitude Avould not let him say ' Nay ! ' It's not likely a young man Avould care to be ahvays under the eyes of a master or mistress, however steady he may be.\" Ah, but neither Mr. nor Mrs. Ashton kneAv there was a magnet under their roof, stronger than all the ordinary inducements which might otherwise have draAvn him away \u2014 and perhaps it was as well for him they did not. Simon, who was present at the time, seemed literally overpoAvered with gratitude for all the good which was falling into the lap of the child of his adoption. He, however, took his own views of the matter, views not calculated to puff Jabez up in his own esteem, and when Mrs. Ashton was gone he broke out \u2014 \"Eh, Jabez, lad! but thah's lit on thi feet! Thah's bin a good lad, aAv reckon, an' thah's sarved thi master gradely ; but thah sees many a lad does that as never gets a lift such as thah's getten.

Yo' hanna furgetten it, aAv hope ? \""], [343, "263 The Manchester Man. No, Jabez had not forgotten it ! It would be strange if he had. Nay, only that morning, in the flush of success he had carried from the counting-house, Avith the buoyant presumption of youth, a conviction that it Avas not so much a prayer as a prophecy nearing fulfilment. Simon brought his soaring pinions down from their Icarian flight. \" Well, lad, it may be ' the Lord has enlarged thi coast,' but if so be He han, thah sees theer's moore room fur thee to slip as Avell as to stond, and theer's moore rayson whoi thah shouldn be thenkful and humble ! for the big book says, ' Let him that stondeth tak' heed lest he fall,' an' aw shouldna loike t' see thi young yead torned wi proide.\" His lecture was someAvhat of a cold shower-bath to Jabez in his hour of triumph, but no doubt it was salutary in its ultimate effects. At all events, it kept the vaulting ambition of the new man a little in check. People \u2014 especially work-people \u2014 then observed early hours. At seven o'clock the outcome supper was on the tables at the \" Concert Hall Tavern ;\" and the elder apprentices, and all such of the workmen as were absolutely engaged on the premises, were there to partake when Jabez found old Simon a seat, himself taking the head of the table, with the tAvo senior apprentices on his right hand and left. The cost of such suppers usually fell on the apprentice, but sometimes, as in this case, the master added his quota. If plain, the provision Avas substantial and ample. Rounds of beef and legs of mutton, piles of floury potatoes, and red cones of carrot on pale beds of mashed turnip, smoked on the board, and the two-pronged forks and horn-hasted knives were flanked with earthenware jugs and horns of ale. It was the first essay of Jabez in the art of carving, and no doubt he made rather an unskilled president. But in the then"], [344, "264 The Manchester man. condition of the loAver classes a large joint of meat Avas a rare sight to a working-man, and so he cut away with no fear of critics. Amidst the rattle of cutlery and crockery, and the rapid play of jaAVs, beef and mutton disappeared, and were succeeded by a tremendous plum-pudding \u2014 the contribution of old Mrs. Clowes \u2014 and half a cheese, Avhich came to the table in the then common japanned receptacle locally known as a cheese-biggin. Appetite and the viands fled together, the noise of tongues succeeded to the noise of knives and forks, and Lancashire humour vented itself in jest and repartee, sometimes coarse, but seldom mischievous. Old Simon enjoyed it immensely. It seemed like a renewal of his own youth. It Avas not, however, until the supper- table was cleared that the chief ceremonial of the evening took place. Then an arm-chair was mounted upon the table, in Avhich Jabez Avas enthroned, the two eldest apprentices standing also on the table on either hand as supporters. An immense bowl of steaming punch was brought in, which Avas held over the head of Jabez by the one apprentice (when he Avas said to be croAvned), Avhilst the other, wielding the punch-ladle as a symbol of authority, with many a theatrical grimace, began to ladle the odorous compound into the glasses of the guests ; and the head overlooker of the manufactory, from the opposite end of the table, prepared to propose the health of the late apprentice, as a neAV member of their craft. At this juncture in walked their master, Mr. Ashton, closely folloAved by Mr. Chadwick, leaning on the arm of the Rev. Joshua Brookes, Avho Avith many a \" pish \" and \" pshaAV ! \" and \" pooh ! \" had professed to come reluctantly \" to see a sensible lad make a fool of himself.\" Their entrance, and the volley of cheers which greeted it, made a momentary pause in the proceedings. Then Mr. Ashton, being duly supplied Avith a ladleful of punch, took his overlooker's place, and, the glass"], [345, "The Manchester Man. 265 serving as a substitute for his snuff-box, he proposed and drank \" Mr. Clegg's health and prosperity,\" and welcomed him among the confraternity of small-ware Aveavers. This was succeeded by a prolonged cheer, and then, as one by one each man's glass was filled, ere he touched it Avith his lips he sang separately (Avith whatsoever voice he might happen to have, musical or otherwise) the following toast to proclaim the released apprentice a freeman of the trade, the chorus being taken up afresh after every repetition of the quatrain : \u2014 Here's a health to he that's now set free. That once was a 'prentice bound, And for his sake this merriment we make. So let his health go round ; Go round, go round, go round, brave boys, Until it comes to me ; For the longer we sit here and drink, The merrier we shall be. Chorus \u2014 Go round, go round, &c. Mr. Ashton had ordered up another bowl of punch, and that being distributed with like ceremony over the neAV small-ware monarch's head, Jabez, from his temporary throne, with all the Avarmth of freshly-stimulated gratitude, delivered a very genuine oration on the excellence of the master then present, and proposed, as a toast, \" Mr. and Mrs. Ashton, our worthy and esteemed master and mistress.\" NoAvadays I'm afraid the master would have been dubbed a \" governor,\" and the mistress ignored altogether ; but, though it is only fifty-five years since, servants were not ashamed to OAvn they had masters and mistresses, and, consequently, were not above being amenable to rule. During this digression, at a hint from someone (I believe old Simon), Jabez, Avhose eloquence must surely have come from the punch-boAvl, dilated on the spiritual relation betAveen the reverend"], [346, "266 The Manchester Man. chaplain and the party assembled, there being scarcely an individual present who had not been either baptised or married by the Rev. Joshua Brookes ; and he wished \" health and long life to him \" Avith much sincerity. A general shout rose in response, but Joshua made no other reply than to turn on his heel (the better to hide his face), and growl out, \" Long life, indeed ! Ugh ! pack of tomfoolery ! \" as he hurried from the room, before either Mr. Ashton or his paralysed brother-in-laAv could follow. Yet, in spite of his gruff disclaimer, he added another boAvl of punch to the \" tomfoolery \" \u2014 at least, one was brought in soon after, and no one there was called upon to pay for it. Relieved from the restraining presence of the gentlemen, tongues Avagged freely, long pipes Avere introduced, song, jest, and toast succeeded each other, and, as the fun grew and the smoke thickened, they mingled confusedly, until at length clear headed Simon drew his arm through that of the novice, and, watching his opportunity, led him unnoticed into the open air, with his head spinning like a teetotum. Jabez aAvakened the next morning with a terrible headache, and a dim recollection of having encountered stately Mrs. Ashton in the hall overnight, when the very statues had seemed to shake their heads at him, and her mild, \" Fie, Jabez ! \" followed him upstairs, apparently carpeted Avith moss or indiarubber for the nonce. It Avas his first dissipation, and his last. He never forgot it. And if anything was Avanting to destroy the germs of self sufficiency and elation, it Avas found in the consciousness of his own frailty, and the sense of shame and self-reproach it engendered.

When her plea for the \" maintenance of discipline \" failed, and she tried cajolery as ineffectually, she gave Avay to the expression of her natural fears that it would \" be the ruin of the Academy\" if Mr. Ashton did not reverse his decision. He loved his daughter too well to yield, and Mrs. Broadbent Avent back to Bradshaw Street to find, as years rolled on, that she had been a true prophetess.

The rapidly-ripening young lady had her will ; she had done with the schoolroom for ever, and her lessons on the harp from Mr. Horobin, and on the piano from George Ware, the leader of the Gentlemen's Concerts, came under quite another category. Nor did she think it beneath her aspirations to retain her place in Mrs. Bland's fashionable dancing-room, where she practised cotillons, quadrilles, and the neAvly-imported Avaltz, with partners on a par Avith herself. But these were accomplishments, and Ave all know, or ought to know by this time, that accomplishments require much more prolonged and arduous application than the merely useful and essential branches of knowledge, theorists for the higher education of women notwithstanding. Miss Augusta was desirous to be captivating and shine in society, and so proud was Mr. Ashton of his beautiful daughter that he fell in readily with the expansive vieAvs of the incipient belle, and new steps or new melodies Avere paraded for his gratification week by week. But Mrs. Ashton, telling her daughter that \"knowledge was light of carriage,\" sent her to Mr. Mabbott's to take lessons in cookery and confectionery, and into the kitchen to put them in practice under the eye of Kezia ; and, exercise being good for health, according to the same sensible mother, she Avas required to assist in bed-making, furniture polishing, dusting, and general household matters, for Avhich the young lady had little liking, and was not to be spurred into liking by any citation of her cousin Ellen's qualifications in these respects. She preferred to dress Avith all the art at her command to make her beauty more beAvildering, and to take her place at harp or piano, or embroidery frame, ready to receive visitors either with or without her mother, and to be as fascinating as possible, especially Avhen Laurence Aspinall was the caller; or she would sit in ddshabill6 in the retirement of her own chamber and read Moore and Byron"], [350, "Thb Manchester Man. 270 because they Avere tabooed, and the handsome lieutenant quoted them so enchantingly, Avhilst Cicily, Avho had something to answer for in this respect, bustled about and overworked herself to spare her darling Miss Augusta, who, Avith all her faults, must have been a loving and lovable creature to win such devotion from a dependent. It happened that the young lady received visitors alone more frequently than was desirable, Mrs. Ashton being usually tied to the Avarehouse in consequence of the interest Mr. Ashton took in the establishment of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and in the project for the widening of Market Street and other of the cramped thoroughfares of the growing town, which necessarily took him much from home and his private business, to say nothing of the excitement consequent on the trial of Queen Caroline during its long progress. But the year 1820, Avhich had opened only to close the long volume of George the Third's life, and to open that of George the Fourth's reign at a chapter of regal Avife persecution Avhich has few parallels, had itself grown old and died, and 182 1 had thrust itself prominently forward. It came with a white robe and a frost-bitten countenance, Avhich grew sharper and more pinched as weeks and months went by. It looked down on the currents of rivers and canals, on the secluded still Avaters of Strangeways Park, the oblong pond in front of the Infirmary, and the leech-shaped lakelet Avithin the area of Ardwick Green, until their ripples curdled under the chilling glance of the NeAV Year. Sterner grew its aspect as the shivering weeks counted them selves into months, and the shrinking waters spread first a thin film, then a thick and a thicker barrier of ice between them and the freezing atmosphere. Every gutter had its slide, along which clattering clogs sped noiselessly; every pool its vociferous throng"], [351, "Thb Manchester Man. 271 of boys, and every pond its mingled concourse of skaters and sliders. Of these, the Infirmary and Ardwick Green Avaters were most patronised ; the former having the more numerous, the latter having the more select body of skaters, and consequently the more fashionable surrounding of spectators. The amusements of the toAvn were then on so limited and exclusive a scale that long frost Avas quite a boon to the younger portion of the community ; and during the sixteen weeks of its continuance, the Green became a promenade gay Avith the Avarm hues of feminine attire, as ladies flocked to Avitness and extol the feats of husbands, brothers, cousins, or particular friends. There AA'as no fear of vulgar overcrowding (except on Sundays) ; working hours were long, and there Avere no Saturday half-holidays, so that only those whose time was at their OAvn disposal could share the sport or overlook it. Amongst these, much to the annoyance of Mr. Aspinall, his son Laurence chose to enrol himself, Avith less regard to the fluctuation of the cotton market, or the comparative ATalue of American or East Indian staples than the Cannon Street merchant thought necessary to fit him for his future partner or successor. The younger man had chosen to construe liberally the word \" gentleman,\" Avhich had been the be-all and end-all of his training, and to regard elegant idleness as its synonym. What availed his fine figure and proficiency in arts and athletics, if he had no opportunity for the display of his person or his skill? And to throw aAvay the rare chance the winter had provided Avas clearly to scorn the gift of the gods. Accordingly he spent more time on ArdAvick Green Pond than in the counting-house, varied occasionally Avith a visit to the Assembly Billiard-room in Back Mosley Street, or a morning promenade in the Infirmary Gardens, from the open gates of which he generally contrived to emerge as Miss Ashton descended"], [352, "The Manchester Man. 272 the steps from Mr. Mabbott's, and just in time to hand her courteously and daintily across the roadway, and bear her company to her own door, discoursing of recent assemblies or concerts, from the former of which she had hitherto been debarred, and of the last occasion on Avhich he had the \"exquisite pleasure of seeing her at ArdAvick Green \" \u2014 occasions Avhich Avere seldom reported at home, any more than the chance meetings on her Avay from Mr. Mabbott's ; and the reticence, be sure, boded no good. Dr. Hull had long ago advised \"out-door exercise\" for the rapidly-growing girl, and there was no embargo on her walks abroad, Mrs. Ashton suspecting no danger, and no surreptitious meetings. Her visits to the Green during the long skating season were quite as unrestrained, except that an escort became a necessity. Occasionally her mother accompanied her, sometimes Mrs. Walmsley and John (then there Avas generally a nurse and baby in the rear), sometimes Ellen and Mrs. Chadwick ; and Augusta had always returned so exhilarated by her country walk, and so delighted with all she had seen, that once or twice, Avhen imperatiA'e business Avithheld Mrs. Ashton from bearing her daughter company, as promised, rather than disappoint, the lady had made Mr. Clegg her deputy, an honour on Avhich he perhaps set far too high a value. Mrs. Ashton Avould have drawn herself up Avith double dignity, and repudiated as an insult the suggestion of any other of their salesmen or clerks as an escort for her beautiful daughter ; but Jabez lived in the house, had lived there so long, had even from her childhood been the girl's frequent guardian, and proved himself so Avorthy of the trust, that she committed her to his care now much as of old, and perhaps all the more readily because she saw, or fancied she saw, a disinclination on Miss Augusta's part to be so accompanied."], [353, "Thb Manchester Man. 273 In March the cold was as intense as in January, and Miss Ashton as eager to Avatch the skaters. One afternoon towards the close of the month, when the breaking-up of the frost was anticipated, quite a family party had gone to the Green, Avrapped n fur-trimmed pelisses of velvet or woollen, with fur-rimmed hats and Brobdignagian muffs. It Avas not yet closing time when Mr. Ashton, always disposed to be friendly Avith Jabez, accosted him. \" The ladies are gone to the Green, Clegg. Suppose you lend me an arm along the slippery roads, and we go to meet them, eh?\" The sparkling eyes of Jabez confirmed his ready tongue's \" With pleasure, sir,\" as, sensible of the honour done him, he left the sale-room, whistled his black friend Nelson from the yard, and they set off at a brisk pace, to keep the blood in circulation, the dog leaping, bounding, and barking before them, in token of good fellowship. As they passed the Infirmary pond, Jabez remarked that the ice began to look Avatery, to which Mr. Ashton replied, \" Yes ; I think Jack Frost's long visit is near its end, and there must be some truth in the old saw that 'a thaw is colder than a frost.'\" At that moment Mr. Aspinall's carriage rolled past them, bearing the merchant homeAvards in distinguished state (private carriages were by no means common), Avhereat Mr. Ashton observed with a shrug, \"How pride punishes itself! Fancy a tall fellow like Mr. Aspinall cramped up in a stifling box upon Avheels on a day like this, when he has the free use of his limbs ! \" Contrary to expectation, they did not come in sight of the ladies until they gained the Green, which they found a scene of wild hubbub and commotion ; skaters and spectators gathering T"], [354, "The Manchester Man. 274 towards the centre of the Green, Avhence came a confused noise of voices, shouting, crying, and screaming. The quick eye of Jabez Avas at once arrested by the figure of Augusta on the opposite bank, the centre of an appalled group, wringing her hands in the very impotence of terror, and as he penetrated the excited croAvd, he saw the hatless head of a man, Avhose body Avas submerged, resting Avith its chin upon a ledge of the ice, Avhich had apparently broken under him. At the first glance he failed to distinguish the head from the distance, and rushed forward, apprehensive lest it should be that of either Mr. Walmsley or his friend Travis, Avhom he knew to be of the party. Recognition came, accompanied by a shock that staggered him. If the ice had attractions for Aspinall and Walmsley, Ellen ChadAvick had certainly as great attractions for Ben Travis ; but it is certain that neither cousins, nor mother, nor aunt Avere sensible that they had been drawn thither simply as a sort of decorous train to Miss Augusta Ashton, Avhose inspiriting had in turn been the fascinating lieutenant, the most graceful and accomplished skater on the pond. Perhaps she hardly knew it herself, not being given to searching her own heart for its motives. But a hint from him had set her longing for \"another sight of the skating before the chance was gone,\" and her imperative will no less than her persuasive voice had SAvayed the rest. Laurence had made the most of the occasion, glad of an opportunity to cultivate the acquaintance of the whole family, and display his graceful figure, and his skill to the best advantage. Now and then he joined the Chadwicks and the Ashtons on the bank, anon darted off, Avheeling hither and thither, so swift in his evolutions, the eye could scarcely follow him. Amongst the skaters the man and his feats stood out. He Avas the observed of all observers, and not vainer was he of his accomplishments than was Augusta at being singled out for"], [355, ""], [356, "ON ARDWICK GREEN PONI"], [357, "Thb Manchester Man. 275 attention in the face of so many damsels of his acquaintance, all, as she foolishly supposed, equally desirous to bask in the sun of his smile. A small match will kindle a large flame if combustibles be there. Fired by her too apparent satisfaction, and Mrs. Ashton's presence, his excessive vanity induced him to perform Avhat, with the imperfect skates of the period, was a distinguished feat. He Avas ordinarily proud of his calligraphy. Now, he Avound and twisted, lifted his skates or dashed them down, until he had scored upon the ice an alphabet in bold capitals ; but whether he had miscalculated his space, or the strength of the ice \u2014 broken into for the use of cattle at the upper end \u2014 or the croAvd of inquisitive or envious followers had been too great for its resistance, as he made the last curl of the letter Z, the ice gave way, and he was plunged in up to the neck, amid the shrieks of women and the shouts of men. His chin had caught upon the ice Avith a stunning blow ; but it rested there, and, aided by the buoyancy of the Avater beneath, upheld him until, with returning sense, he struggled to bring his shoulders above the surface, and upheave himself. He trod the water, and it sustained him, but the ice Avould not. He AA'as forced to content himself Avith the use of his hands beneath as paddles, to relieve the pressure on his chin, and wait for help, which seemed an eternity in coming. He had been in the water some time when Jabez and Mr. Ashton appeared on the scene, amongst women shrieking with affright, and men rushing about Avithout presence of mind, or paralysed to powerlessness. Mr. Travis alone appeared to have a thought, and he had sent for ropes and hatchets to cut a Avay to him through the ice itself. But there was a question, would his strength hold out ? \" Will no one save him ? Will no one save him ? \" cried Augusta, piteously."], [358, "276 The Manchester Man. \"Fifty pounds to him Avho will save my son!\" was the cry of the frantic father, Avho had Avitnessed the accident from his own carriage window. \" A hundred ! \u2014 tAvo hundred pounds ! \u2014 five hundred pounds to anyone who will save him ! \" \" It's noan a bit o' use, measter,\" said a Avorking man, with a shake of his head. \" Men wunna chuck their lives aAveay fur brass ; an' yon ice is loike a pane o' glass wi' a stone through it.\" Unfortunately, impulsive Ben Travis had darted fonvard to his rescue at the outset, and his ponderous Aveight had cracked the already broken ice in all directions. He had himself retreated with difficulty ; and now no offers of reward Avould tempt men to put their OAvn lives in peril, though Kit ToAvnley Avas there, urging others to the attempt, and Bob, the ex-groom, had rushed for ropes they had neither pluck nor skill to use, since a noosed cord, flung like a lasso, Avould have strangled him. \"Oh! save him; save him, Jabez!\" implored Augusta, as he and her father came up. Jabez looked at her strangely. His head seemed to spin. His face went livid as that on the ice. Had his secret devotion no other end than this? True, she had called him \"Jabez,\" but so she had called him in his servitude. She had appealed to him as one she trusted in implicitly ; but the appeal sounded as made for one she loved, and that was not himself, but he who, as boy and man, had wounded him in soul and body. The very tone of her cry was as a knell to his hopes and himself. It was his foe and his rival Avho was perishing ! Was he called upon to risk his life to Avarm a serpent to sting him again ? The conflict in his breast Avas sharp and terrible. \" If thine enemy hunger, give him food,\" seemed to float in his ears. There Avas a small gloved hand on his arm, a pale, sweet face looking up into his. The moments Avere flying fast. \" Oh ! Jabez, Jabez, do try ! \""], [359, "The Manchester man. 277 \" I will,\" said he, hoarsely. Had he not often declared in his secret heart that he would give his life to serve her ? \u2014 and should he be ungenerous enough to shrink now ? \" It is folly to attempt. I forbid it ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Ashton, laying her hand on his arm. And Ellen Chadwick, pale as Augusta, tried to stop him Avith \u2014 \" You must not ! you must not ! You will perish ! \" Even strangers from the crowd warned him back. But he was gone ere Mrs. Chadwick softly recalled her daughter to herself. \"Hush, Ellen! This is not seemly. Mr. Clegg will attempt nothing impossible.\" He hurried to the side nearest Laurence ; called to him, \"Keep up; help is coming!\" \u2014 asked for ladders; gave a word or two of instruction to Mr. Ashton and Travis ; sent Nelson on the ice to try its strength ; secured a rope round his own waist ; then, lying flat on the cold ice, cautiously felt his way to the farther side of Aspinall, whose eyes were closed, and whose strength Avas ebbing fast. He hardly heard the words of cheer addressed to him.\" Two long ladders had been lashed side by side to give breadth of surface. These, by the help of cords and Nelson, whose sagacity Avas akin to reason, he drew across the cracked and gaping ice ; and crept slowly from rung to rung, Avatched from the land breathlessly, until he reached his almost insensible rival. With rapidly benumbing fingers he secured strong ropes beneath each shoulder, sending Nelson back to the bank with the main line, in case his own strength was insufficient to lift the dead Aveight of Laurence, or that the ice should yield beneath the double weight. Someone sent a brandy-flask back by the dog, \"Can you swalloAv?\" he asked. There was no answer, but a gurgle,"], [360, "The Manchester Man. 278 He moistened the blue lips, Avhile the head bent slightly back, introduced a small quantity of the potent spirit between his set teeth ; and, having Avarmed himself by the same means, essayed to lift the freezing skater, who was almost powerless to aid. But the latter Avith an extreme effort raised an arm above the ice, and grasped recumbent Jabez. And now Nelson proved his worth. He set his teeth in Aspinall's high coat-collar, and tugged until their united strength drew him upwards and across the ladder sledge, almost as stiff and helpless as a corpse. To lessen the Aveight, Jabez crept from the ladders ; they were drawn to the side with their living freight before he himself Avas out of danger ; for the heavy pressure and the swift motion set the ice cracking under him, and with extreme difficulty he dragged himself to the bank to sink down on the hardened snow, overcome by the strain of mind and muscle, whilst the approving crowd set up a shout, and Augusta Ashton thanked him tremulously. \" I'm afraid, Clegg, you've spent your strength for a dead man,\" said Travis, grasping his hand Avarmly, \" and Aspinall was scarcely Avorth it, alive or dead.\" But Jabez made no reply. He rose slowly and painfully, shook off the congratulatory croAvd of strangers and friends on the plea of needing to \" Avarm and dry himself,\" refused point blank to accept the grateful hospitality of Mr. Aspinall, and, taking the proffered arm of Travis, turned towards the \" George and Dragon,\" as little like one who had done a noble action as could be imagined.

Mrs. Ashton, who knew that to be a home without a thinking woman at its head, volunteered her services, and entered the house with the bearers, leaving the trembling Augusta Avith their friends. She gently put the old woman aside, and felt pulse and heart. \" There is life,\" said she, \" and while there is life there is hope.

And for once Mr. Aspinall accepted a kindness as a favour, not as a tribute to his personal importance, and he placed his carriage at the disposal of Mr. Ashton and herself for their return home without a sign of his usual self-inflation. His importance received a considerable shock, however, Avhen he called at the house in Mosley Street the folloAving day to report progress, and relieve himself of his obligation to his son's preserver by paying over the five hundred pounds he had in his extremity offered as a reAvard. \" I do not think Mr. Clegg will accept a reward,\" said Mr. and Mrs. Ashton in a breath. \"Not accept it!\" and the portly figure seemed to SAvell ! \"five hundred pounds is a large sum for a young man in his position ; only a fool or a madman would refuse it.\" \"Just so, just so,\" replied Mr. Ashton, offering his open snuff box to his visitor, whilst Mrs. Ashton stirred the fire as a sort of dubious disclaimer ; \" but I think, for all that, you will find Ave are right ; Mr. Clegg is not a common man, and is not actuated by common motives. \u2014 My dear?\" He nodded, and Mrs. Ashton pulled the bell-rope. Mulberry-suited James answered on the instant. \" Mr. Clegg is Avanted.\" Mr. Clegg, labouring under the disadvantage of a cold caught the previous afternoon, to which any huskiness of voice might be attributed, obeyed the summons.

He was pale enough when he entered, but his face flushed, his lips compressed, and the scar on his brow shoAved vividly, as Mr. Aspinall drew forth a roll of crisp bank notes from his pocket-book, and loftily offered to him the reward he had \"earned by his bravery.\" He flushed, put back the notes with a movement of his hand, and said, coldly : \" You owe me nothing, sir. The meanest creature on God's earth should have freely such service as I rendered to your son. I cannot set a price on life.\" But I offered the reAvard, and the fact is, I must discharge the debt.

The notes in his palm were light enough, but lying there they represented liberality contemned ; a debt unpaid ; an undischarged obligation to an inferior ; and not thrice their value in gold could have pressed so heavily on Mr. Aspinall as that last consideration.

But had they mounted the polished oaken stairs to the dainty chamber Avhere Augusta Ashton lay in bed with a \" cruel headache,\" brought on by the fright, and eyes red with weeping at the catastrophe which had befallen her adorable admirer, the gallant lieutenant, and heard her half-audible lamentations, the ansAver might have been complete. Mrs. Ashton had heard Augusta's frantic appeal to Jabez at the pond, had seen him stagger and turn livid as if shot, noted the inward struggle ere he said, \" I will ;\" but she had ascribed it to old and unforgiven injuries, and thinking it hard that he should be called upon to hazard his life for his known enemy with chances so heavy against him, had herself forbidden the attempt. This was all the solution she had to offer Mr. Aspinall. In the excitement of the accident and the rescue, she had overlooked Augusta's excessive emotion, but now her mother's heart took alarm. Could it be that the younger eyes of Jabez had seen a preference for the handsome scapegrace which she had not? The matter Avas talked over by husband and wife long after Mr. Aspinall had left ; and the anxious mother questioned the maiden in the privacy of her own room, to come thence Avith the sad conviction that Augusta had prematurely been led captive"], [365, "The Manchester Man. 283 by a handsome face and a dashing air, irrespective of worth or worthlessness. Yet she consoled herself and Mr. Ashton Avith the reflection, \" It is, after all, only a girlish fancy, and will die out.\" \"Just so, and as the young rake is laid by the leg for one while, there is all the more chance,\" assented Mr. Ashton. \"If his immersion does not convert him into a hero,\" added the matron, Avith a clearer knowledge of her daughter. Yet neither asked themselves how the intuitive perception of Jabez came to be more acute than their own, nor Avhat poAver impelled him to risk his life for an enemy at the mere bidding of Augusta. Indeed, they set the hazardous exploit down to the score of magnanimity and bravery only. Equally unobservant were they of Ellen Chadwick's remonstrance, or her feverish watch of every perilous turn Jabez and Nelson had taken on the ice, or of the caresses she lavished on the dog when all was over. Only Mrs. Chadwick had seen that, as she had seen fainter signs years before ; but she held her peace, and, having a leaven of her sister's pride, \" hoped she was mistaken.\" There were three young hearts consumed by the same passion \u2014 that which lies at the root of the happiness or misery of the world, \u2014 one nursing the romance, two fighting against its hopelessness in silence and concealment ; but \" the race is not always to the SAvift, nor the battle to the strong.\" Jabez Clegg could not tell when he had not loved Augusta Ashton, from the time Avhen she was young enough to play about the ware-rooms, or to be lifted across the muddy roadways in his strong apprentice arms, when it was his pleasant duty to protect her to and from school. But he could trace back the time when Hogarth's prints gave to that love a definite shape, and he began to look upon his master's daughter as a prize to be attained.

Both Augusta and her mother noted the contrast between the elegant manner, suave tones, and rounded periods of Laurence Aspinall's thanks and the curt disclaimer of Jabez, though their deductions were different. Augusta was in raptures with the rose-giver. \" Ah ! my dear, all is not gold that glitters.

The blacksmiths wrought on their anvil, and carried also on long poles, horse-shoes, &c. The brass and copper smiths, likeAvise at work, had a bright array of kettles, candlesticks, and a mounted man in armour, as had also the tin-plate workers. The glass- blowers made a goodly array, and gave away tokens as they went. The men wore hats and caps brittle and brilliant, with wavy plumes of spun glass, whilst birds, ships, goblets, and decanters on their poles glistened in the beams of the hot sun. A printing-press distributed appropriate verses, worked off in the course of the procession. And St. Crispin's followers waxed their threads and plied their awls on boots and shoes as they and their benches were borne along, followed by their leather-aproned fraternity, holding aloft their productions, from the most gigantic of Wellingtons to the tiniest infant's slipper. All branches of the cotton trade were represented. There was cotton in bags ; twist in bales ; carding, roving, spinning, weaving, all going on under the eyes of the onlookers, with the workpeople following in their best and brightest.

He had tired of his processional march in the broiling sun by the time they had skirted Ardwick, and defiled into Chancery Lane. The two friends by his side, Mr. John McConnell and Mr. John Green (both cotton-spinners with whom he dealt), being of the same mind, they had fallen out of the line in Ancoats Lane, and turned down Canal Street to the house of the latter, to refresh themselves Avith something less dry than snuff or road-dust. Mr. Green was the uncle of Henry Liverseege the artist, fragile of form and spiritual of face, but the latter Avas then only a genius in his nineteenth year \u2014 with fame and an early grave dimly foreshadowed. They found him on the doorstep, Avith his fusssy and fidgety, though kind-hearted aunt, just back from Mr. Gore's in Piccadilly, whence they had seen the show. The gentlemen's requirement, a \"draught of ale,\" was soon supplied, accompanied by a spasmodic comment on the \"gand display,\" and the exhibition of a pair of the loyally inscribed fillets she had secured as the smallware-weavers passed. \" By-the-bye, that was a wonderfully effective banner of yours, Mr. Ashton,\" interposed the thin voice of Liverseege. \" Who painted it?\" A young felloAv in my employ, Avho occasionally designs for us,\" ansAvered Mr. Ashton, handing his snuff-box to the group in rotation \u2014 \" quite a self-taught artist ! \" \" Indeed !

Graciously, though Avith her natural stateliness, Mrs. Ashton received the new comers ; Mrs. Green, finding the company generally in morning visiting dress, was at ease about her cap ; the tea was exhilarating, the viands toothsome, the wines excellent ; there Avas one common topic for discussion ; the ice of ceremony had thaAved hours before ; and genial Mr. Ashton, having locked the doors to prevent the escape of a guest before the supper he had bespoken was demolished, was thoroughly in his element. Mrs. Ashton Avas not quite so much at ease, though she was too well-bred to manifest her disquiet, Avhich had two sources. In the first place, the presumptious salutation of Augusta by Lieutenant Aspinall had jarred a sensitive nerve. In the second, Mr. Ashton, generously impulsive, had introduced Mr. Clegg to their friends, and as a friend of whom he was himself proud. She thoroughly appreciated Jabez, and equally contemplated his advancement ; but she Avas for \" making no more haste than good speed,\" and considered it more prudent to raise him by insensible degrees.

The lady, who Avas so afraid of touching the dignity of her friends, had not heard her less exclusive lord Avhisper to the two cotton spinners, \" I'm afraid I've committed a grave misdemeanour in Mrs. Ashton's sight by bringing young Clegg among our party ; but kings are net croAvned every day, and I thought it a good opportunity to bring a Avorthy lad out.

Meanwhile Augusta, the centre of a group of young people, indulged in sentimental chit-chat, and, trifling with her fan and human hearts, completed the enslavement of her last admirer, a fair-haired Mr. Marsland ; while Jabez, from his distant seat, looked and longed in vain.

Moreover, he bore him away to Mrs. Clough, at the loo-table, and called her attention to the change time had effected in the old tanner's foster-child, in the most cordial manner. Thanks to Mr. Ashton, Mr. Clegg had truly got his first foot into Manchester society that coronation-day, and his old hopes might have revived, had not a disturbing element crept into the room during the denunciatory oration of his clerical friend.

The lustre of that evening's introduction was dimmed for Jabez. Augusta scarcely looked at him as she brushed past to supper, leaning on the arm of Lieutenant Aspinall, her white dress in strong contrast to his dark uniform ; and no doubt his pain was pictured on his face, for Ellen Chadwick sighed, as she too passed him with her martial cavalier, and half turned to look pitifully as she went.

Along the Avhole course of the procession the Manchester Yeomanry had been greeted with more hisses and groans than cheers. This had chafed their noble spirits, and on disbanding they had sought consolation in the Avine-cup, which temperate Jabez was not slow to observe, although their degree ot exhilaration Avas not then considered a disqualification for the drawing-room or for the society of ladies.

They Avere always at Avar, and there never . was Avanting a casus belli. The previous September he had been more than usually irritated by a lampoon which began \" O Jotty, you dog, Vour house we well know Is headquarters of prog \" the purport of Avhich was to fix on him the stigma of inviting a friend to dine, and regaling him Avith a black-pudding only. Lashed to fury, he burst into the Grammar School when the first and second-form boys Avere assembled in the afternoon to rehearse the speeches Avhich, according to custom, they Avere to deliver in public at the annual commemoration in October.

He stuck himself in the doonvay Avith his legs against the door-post, and his back against the door itself, to the extreme risk of broken limbs, Avhilst his young and vigorous opponents brought their strength to bear upon the door to force him out. With such odds he was sure to be overcome ; but, driven into thc yard, he fought with his antagonists like a mastiff at bay, and they, like the cowards they must have been, to have assailed in a body an old man (under any provocation), by sheer force of numbers, bore him backwards to the Avail, and, but for the opportune arrival of Dr, Smith, Avould have repeated the outrage perpetrated on Jabez Clegg eight years before. He might well say Dr. Smith had saved his life. Such a fall, Avhether in high or low water, to so old a man, Avould haA'e been certain destruction. They broke his heart, I think, if they did not break his limbs, for he never was the same man afterwards. Even old Mrs. Clowes used to rally him on his frequent \" fits of the dumps.\" Whether Jabez and Ben Travis had, or had not, lost sight of the Parson's homily, they were linked arm in arm, the rich yeomanry officer and the unpretending smallware-salesman, just as, nearly nine years previously, the big, raAv-boned youth, Avith a heart large enough to match his frame, had linked his arm in that of the poor Blue-coat boy, as a friend and protector, when as yet his admittance into society Avas undreamed of. Where the four roads met at Hyde's Cross, a staggering Charlie (as the Avatchmen were called, much as, at this day, they are Bobbies) passed them, with his horn lantern and staff, and his rattle in his belt, proclaiming \u2014"], [399, "The Manchester Man. 313 \"Past ten o'clock!\" (hiccup). \"And a foin moonleet neet ! \" The two stood for a moment ; then, animated by a desire to ascertain if Joshua Brookes had spoken sooth, or, in his spleen exaggerated, they turned up Shudehill, all alive with people who were ordinarily at that hour in bed, and made their Avay to the market. Exaggerate ! Joshua Brookes had seen but in part, and painted but in part. Every avenue to the market Avas a scene of debauchery. Hogarth's print of \" Gin Lane \" was feeble beside it. The distribution of food Avas over, but that of drink continued. The oil lamps of the street, the dying illumination lamps, and the misty moonlight showed a picture of unimaginable grossness ; Avhilst their ears Avere assailed Avith foulness Avhich Avould have shocked a hardened man of the Avorld \u2014 hoAv much more these inexperienced young friends ! Children, men, and women, their clothes torn or disarrayed, lay singly, or in groups, on the paths, or in the gutters, asleep or awake, drunk, sick, helpless, exposed ; there Avas fighting and cursing over the ale yet procurable ; there Avere loaves in the gutters, and meat trampled in the mire ; food Avhich, properly distributed, Avould have gladdened many a poor, hard-Avorking family, too self-respecting to join that clamorous mob. The tAvo young men turned away sick and disgusted. \" Henry Hunt, in advocating the disuse of excisable liquors,\" said Jabez, thoughtfully, \" may only have designed to cripple the Government ; but surely no one could Avitness scenes like these, Avhether Whig or Tory, Avithout feeling that some restriction on drink is absolutely necessary for the safety of the State and the comfort of the people.\" \" You are right, Mr. Clegg,\" responded Travis, heartily. \" Men of all politics ought to meet on this ground.

They had kept Avell Avithin the shade of the pillared piazza Avhich extended along the side to their right, and, stunned by the uproar of brawling and fighting crowds, picked their Avay between degraded humanity in heaps on the paA'ement, crushed hats and bonnets, torn caps and shawls, boots and shoes Avhich had done duty as drinking vessels, sodden meat and bread, and had much ado to avoid splashing through puddles of ale and other abominations. They had emerged into Oak Street, glad to have got tolerably clear of the clamour and brutality, Avhen a cry from the direction of Tib Street, \"Watch! Help! Watch!\" fell on their ears in tones Avhich had a strangely familiar ring to Jabez. Hastening on at a run, they came upon a decently-dressed man struggling against three or four drunken ruffians with heavy clogs on their feet. They had got the man doAvn, and Avere vociferating Avith oaths not to be repeated here. \" Gie him a lick Avi' thi clog ! \" \" Punce him Avell ! \" \" Shut up his tater-trap fur him ! \" \" Purr him i' th' bread-basket ! \" \" Fettle his mug Avi' thi clog ! \""], [401, "The Manchester Man. 315 Before Jabez and his companion could prevent it, a heavy thud, folloAved by a groan, told of a brutal kick ; the two only dashed among them in time to arrest the other clogs, already on the backward swing for force ; and saved the prostrate man by turning the fury of the savages on themselves. The cowardly brutes, hoAvever, stood little chance against sobriety and skill, backed by the muscular frame of Jabez and the herculean one of Travis, even though they carried Aveapons of offence on their feet, and plied them vigorously; and before a droning Avatchman hove in sight to spring his rattle for assistance, they Avere over mastered or put to the rout.

Nor Avas there a trace of mirth on the face of Jabez when, at parting with Ben Travis on the Mosley Street door-step, he gripped, more in pain that pleasure, the big hand extended so cordially. It Avas after midnight, but from the open AvindoAvs of the still-lighted draAving-room the thin quick ears of Jabez had caught the sound of Augusta's melodious voice blending Avith that of Laurence Aspinall in a popular duet, although the notes of the latter were neither so clear nor so steady as they might have been. The pallor on her foster-son's face Bess attributed to tender hearted sympathy for her injured husband; but Jabez hurried away from her oppressive thanks to the solitude of his OAvn chamber, Avhere he could bury his face in his quivering hands, and unseen wrestle Avith emotions of Avhich she had no conception. Never had he known a day so chequered. The same sun which had looked down at noontide on the triumph of his amateur brush, had beamed on Augusta Ashton's conscious cheeks, as she accepted his rival's familiar act of gallantry Avithout so much as a frown. The evening had made a man of him \u2014 listed him into a new sphere \u2014 brought him, so to speak, nearer to his divinity, within the radius of her smiles, the music of her voice. She had put her small Avhite hand Avithin his, and blessed him AA'ith a word or two of shy recognition ; but Laurence Aspinall had again come like a cloud between him and his sunbeam ; her sAveetest smiles, her softest tones, Avere for the intruder ; her arm had rested willingly on his, her voice had blent Avith his in sentimental song, and darkness once more shut out hope from Jabez. \" Common sense might have taught me that my love Avas folly, presumption, madness!\" he argued with himself; that the heiress of a Avealthy man Avould not stoop to her father's Blue coat apprentice. But oh I \" he groaned, \" I had hoped to raise"], [403, "Thb Manchester Man. 317 myself step by step nearer to her level \u2014 to make myself worthy of her as a man, if I had not riches to lay at her feet.

He had gone through all this struggle once before, and thought he had overcome his weakness ; but at the touch of the enchanter's Avand love had blazed up afresh, and was not to be smothered. His reverie was broken into by the tread of many feet on the staircase below, and the murmur of voices calling one to another ; the hall-door shut Avith a clang, and then a light foot came tripping up the stair alone, and from heart and lips dropped unconsciously the soft refrain of that too well-known duet. She, too, Avas carrying to her chamber memories of the night, and bearing the burden lightly. He listened until a door closed upon step and song. Then, as if its echoes pierced his sous he set his teeth and clenched his outstretched hands in mute agony. There Avas more than hopeless love in this \u2014 there was jealousy also. Then he murmured half audibly, \" If he were only Avorthy of her I could bear it better ; but to see her cast her heart at the feet of one Avho will trample on it, is beyond mortal endurance.\" He started to his feet. A bright thought irradiated his face. \" CoAvard that I am ! I am quitting the battle without striking a blow. I am myself unworthy of Augusta if I surrender her to a heartless profligate Avithout an effort to save her. ' Faint heart never won fair lady.'

Be that as it may, fourteen or fifteen years elapsed between the first act of demolition for widening (at the shop of a Mr. Maund), and that last feat of narrowing, which"], [406, "the Manchester Man. 320 blocked up and darkened history (as represented by the Palace) Avith common stone Avarehouses for every-day merchandise. Alas! Clio and all her sister muses must succumb Avhen Mammon is on the march ! But Mammon had only got his first foot in the street on that Thursday morning in July, Avhich blushed at the doings of the Coronation night, and the \"Palace Inn\" yet held its head high as beseemed its historic state. The open space in front was enlivened by the neAvly-painted London stage-coach, the \"Lord Nelson,\" the fresh scarlet coats of coachmen and guards, the assembling of passengers and luggage, the shouting and sAvearing of half-aAvake ostlers and porters, the grumbling of the first comers (shivering in the raAV air) at the unpunctuality of the stage, the excuses of the booking-clerk, the self-gratulations of the last arrival that he Avas \"in time,\" the dragging of trunks and portmanteaus on to the top, the thrusting of bags and boxes into the boot, the harnessing of snorting steeds the horsing of the vehicle, the scrambling of the \" outsiders \" to the top by the ladder and wheel, the self-satisfied settlement of the \"insides\" in the places they had \" booked for,\" the crushing and thrusting of friends Avith last messages and parting words, the crack of the Avhip, the sound of the bugle, the prancing of horses, the rattle of Avheels, and the dashing off up Market Street Lane of the gallant four-in-hand, amid the hurrahs of excited spectators. Every morning Avitnessed a someAvhat similar scene of bustle and excitement at five o'clock, when the London coach started, but every morning did not see Jabez mounted on the box-seat Avith the coachman. Nor did every morning see the coach an hour behind time, or the driver's face quite so red, or the spectators so heavy-eyed, or so much handing up of horns and glasses to the passengers, to be returned empty, or leave Mr. Ashton standing there Avhen the \"Lord Nelson\" had boAvled aAvay."], [407, "The Manchester Man. 321 That Coronation Day had much to answer for. When Tom Hulme should have risen at four o'clock to return home, his bruised limbs Avere so stiff and sore that the soldier, who had borne the fatigue of many a campaign, Avho had bivouacked on the battle-field, after a forced march, and being ready Avith the sun for the day's duties, had to confess himself \" fettled \" by Lancashire clogs, and unable to stir. There was no alternative but to acquaint Mr. Ashton. The mill could not be left Avithout a manager. After the night's unwonted dissipation, Mr. Ashton slept heavily, and was with difficulty aroused. When once he com prehended the state of affairs, he Avas on the alert. \" It's a bad business ! \" said he to his wife, as he dressed in haste. \" ' There is nothing so bad, but it might be worse,' \" was her consolatory reply. \" Never bewail a loss till you have done your best to repair it. Can you not send Mr. Clegg to Whaley Bridge for a feAV days ? \" \" My dear, your counsel is invaluable, but I fear there is not time to catch the coach ; it is twenty minutes past four now.\" \" It is sure to be late this morning, and Jabez will catch it if it is to be caught,\" was her quick rejoinder. Bess had already awakened Jabez, and he, fully dressed, met Mr. Ashton at his bedroom door Avith \" Can I be of any service, sir?\" A prompt commentary on Mrs. Ashton's declaration. A few necessaries hastily crammed into a carpet bag ; a bowl of milk and a crust of bread as hastily swalloAved ; and Jabez, accompanied by Mr. Ashton, was on his way to the Palace coach-office confident they were in time, not having heard the guard's bugle, or met the coach.

As the manufacturer, satisfied that the mill-hands at Whaley Bridge Avould not be left altogether to their OAvn devices, stood Avithin a short distance of the high steps looking after the vanishing coach, a party of roysterers came swaggering out of the inn, hallooing Avith all their tipsy might. One in advance of the rest, observing an elderly gentleman beloAv, pointed him out to his companions as fair game, and leaning over the rail to steady himself, cried out \u2014 \" Halloo, old fogey ; are you a Tory or a Radical ? D me, take your hat off before gentlemen ! \" and, suiting the action to the word, extended a riding-whip he carried, and jerked Mr. Ashton's hat off into the dust ; whereupon his Avorthy comrades set up a loud guffaw in admiration of the feat. Naturally Mr. Ashton, his brief reverie disturbed, stooped to pick up the fallen beaver, and making due alloAvance for the unwonted occasion, turned to remonstrate good-humouredly with an excited stranger who had evidently drunk the king's health too frequently. It Avas not with more surprise than annoyance that he recognised four of the hilarious party in the doonvay and on the steps of the inn, which had apparently been open the night through. Not one of the four was in a condition to recognise him, although tAvo of them, John Walmsley and Laurence Aspinall, had supped overnight at his OAvn table, although the third, Kit Townley, had good reason for remembrance, and Ned Barret was anything but a stranger.

Mr. Ashton, though a reasonably temperate man himself, was not so greatly shocked at these young carousers as Ave might be. Long usage blunts sensibilities. It was a glorious distinction to be a three-bottle man ; the inability to drink a solitary bottle of wine at a sitting Avas a sort of disqualification for good fellowship ; and it Avas considered a fine thing for a boy of seven to \" toss off a glass like a man ; \" so the genial old gentleman was inclined to allow some latitude for the special occasion. But they had touched him on a tender point. The light mention of his darling daughter's name roused his blood. \" John Walmsley,\" he cried angrily, looking up, \" Avhat brings you, a married man, Avith these young rakes at this hour of the morning ? \" \" Pray wha-at brought y-you here, old fogey ? \" hiccoughed Aspinall, answering for the other.

Neither he nor Mrs. Ashton Avas disposed to overlook the fact that Kit ToAvnley and Ned Barret \u2014 scapegraces by repute \u2014 were of the party, nor that Augusta's name had been familiarly used in their midst. \" ' Birds of a feather flock together,' \" said the lady ; \" and if Mr. Aspinall's son associates Avith that reckless and dishonest Kit Townley, he is a very unfit friend for John Walmsley, and still worse for our dear Augusta.\" \" Just so ; for a dashing blade Avith a handsome face, Avho sports a uniform, talks poetry, and sings sentimental songs, is just the fellow to take a silly girl's fancy, before she is old enough to think.

She paused as she Avas taking her dry toast from the sih'er rack, and half-hesitatingly remonstrated. \" Of course I should not wish to associate Avith Mr. ToAvnley's friends.

Bess, in a fair white muslin cap, a large check apron over her dark chocolate-and-Avhite print goAvn (her blue bedgown days were over), Avas moving quietly about the house-place, preparing their early breakfast, no longer restricted to oatmeal porridge. Tom, looking Avorn, but clean and neat as loving hands could make him, leaned back in his soft arm-chair, and Avatched her with well-satisfied eyes. Little Sim was already in the garden Avith his grandfather, helping to gather raspberries and currants for preserving. The tall oak-cased clock struck seven, and then, true to time, the guard's bugle announced the coming of the coach from Manchester.

Before she reached the avenue gate, the stuffy vehicle had yielded up three ladies and two bandboxes, and the guard having unlocked the capacious boot (a kind of"], [419, "Thb Manchester Man. 331 closet at the back), dragged thence, Avith much superfluous puffing and straining, two hair trunks of moderate dimensions. Yes, there stood Mrs. Ashton, grandly calm ; bright-haired Augusta, tall, slim, and, it must be added, unamiably silent ; and Ellen Chadwick, Avhose black eyes had an absolute gloAv of expectancy in their depths.

He Avas a pitiable object, the scoff of the rabble, but he had sense enough to knoAv his protectors. At the instance of the four-year-old child he shouldered the box Avith a vacant chuckle, and Sim, loaded with an oval pasteboard bandbox half as big as himself, Avaddled after him as fast as his deformity Avould permit. Before the travellers could reach the top of the avenue Jabez Clegg was with them, the other trunk upon his shoulder. He had heard at the \"White Hart\" of their arrival, and had almost sacrificed the dignity of his position in his desire to run. There Avere more greetings, accompanied by a cordial shaking of hands, and Bess and Simon looked on with pleasure, not unmixed Avith pain, that the foundling they had adopted and reared had mounted far above their heads, albeit in rising he had drawn them up too. He breakfasted not with them in the house-place, but Avith the new-comers in the parlour, and Bess herself Avaited upon them, Meg, her little maid, being off in the harvest field gleaning for a bed-ridden mother.

She saw him turn to ansAver the arch sallies of Miss Ashton, and the quieter observations of Miss Chadwick, and noted that the dark eyes of the latter kindled when he spoke, and her cheeks had a Avarmer glow, as if they caught their hue from the flushed face of Jabez.

Mrs. Ashton Avas one of those Avho could lift up Avithout stooping. Clouds never lingered on Augusta's face ; she had been transported thither, as she said, \"with no more ceremony than a bale of twist,\" but she put off her displeasure with her travelling bonnet, and danced into the kitchen airily as a sylph, to help Bess out of the quandary caused by their advent. \" I am afraid our arrival has been very inauspicious,\" Augusta said, \" but I can assure you I AA'as not consulted, and am not to blame.\" (She had certainly not been consulted \u2014 blame was another matter.) \" And now what can I do for you, Mrs. Hulme?\" Augusta tucked up the sleeves of her peach-coloured gingham dress, borroAved a linen apron from Bess, Avho confessed to being \" rayther a heavy hond at paste,\" and soon the matron was at ease respecting pies, and tarts, and custards. Simon Clegg brought in a dish of trout fresh from the stream, the larder supplied savoury ham and eggs, the garden furnished peas, so Mrs. Ashton Avas not far Avrong. It Avas but a spurt on Augusta's part ; her tender im pressionable heart had melted at Mrs. Hulme's first look of dismay, but, the impulse over, there Avas no more tucking up of sleeves or handling of paste pins. Fortunately for their digestion, Ellen ChadAvick had no less skill, since, quiet as she Avas, she seemed to lack an outlet for superabundant energy, and, obtrusively restless, helped Bess she hardly knew hoAv, or how much. Augusta wandered about cottage and garden, or sat for hours under the shade of the great sycamore tree, singing loAv-voiced plaintive ditties ; feeling herself the most ill-used and wretched being in existence, separated from her adorable lover ; and the"], [422, "The Manchester Man. 334 more she brooded, the more discontented and melancholy she became. It was all very real and very much to be deplored. No knife cuts so keenly at the heart-strings as the sharp edge of a first love turned in upon itself; and Augusta Avas as much in love as ever Avas maiden of seventeen. Mrs. Ashton Avent daily to the mill, but a casual remark of Mrs. Hulme's on \"Miss Ashton's mopin' an' malancholy\" aroused the attention of the energetic mother, and she did her best to counteract morbid fancies Avith long sharp walks in the early morning (extending, on one oecasion, as far as Shawcross Hall, where she astonished her relatives by an informal visit), and a repetition of the dose in the evening, Avhen Mr. Clegg made one of the party, thus unconsciously adding fuel to the fires Avhich, unknoAvn to her, consumed alike her niece and her Avarehouseman. At the end of ten days, Mrs. Ashton returned to Manchester, leaving the girls behind. She had extorted a promise from Augusta that she Avould not Avrite to Mr. Laurence Aspinall, and relied on that promise being faithfully kept. Moreover, after some debate Avith herself, as they Avalked from the mill together on the last afternoon of her stay, she committed her daughter and niece to Jabez Clegg's care. \" You are a very young man for so important a charge,\" she said, \" but you are steady as old Time, and of your integrity and fidelity Ave have had many proofs. Miss Ashton's health demands a prolonged stay on this breezy hill-side, but I fear she feels it dull after Manchester.

He had no more clue to Mrs. Ashton's hidden meaning than she to his secret emotions. It had been Aviser to have been more explicit. Without that charge he might have made it a point of honour, if not of duty, to hold aloof from the young ladies, lest he should be obtrusive ; as it was, the more he pondered, the more he became satisfied that it Avas only a delicate Avay of giving sanction to a companionship he might otherwise have regarded as presumptuous. Accordingly, he constituted himself their cavalier after business hours, fulfilling to the letter his instructions to endeavour to amuse Augusta whenever he found her drooping, well rewarded if he could win back a smile or a peal of the rippling laughter he had heard so oft in her school-girl days. His attentions to Miss ChadAvick Avere tinctured with the profoundest respect, but there was no effort to entertain or be agreeable ; on the contrary, it was Miss Chadwick Avho kept the light shafts of her cousin's wit Avithin bounds Avhen they were likely to wound \u2014 as they did sometimes. The \"White Hart,\" to Sim's disquiet, would have suffered long from dearth of herbage, had not thunderous clouds emptied their reservoirs amongst the hills, until brooks became rivers, and roads almost impassable. Then Jabez resumed his brush, Sim clapped his thin little hands with delight, whilst the sedate young lady of twenty-four, and the bewitching damsel of SAveet seventeen, varied the monotony of piano, book, or embroidery-frame, Avith an occa sional criticism of his Avork,"], [424, "336 The Manchester man. It was a time fraught with intoxicating delight, but ol terrible temptation to Jabez. The frequent fits of languor Avhich bowed Augusta down like a drooping lily, made her only more dangerously dear to him, and it needed all his strength to remember that she was his master's daughter, and confided to his care. If he now thought of Laurence Aspinall and his fascination, it Avas only as a butterfly beau, for whom no sensible maiden could entertain a permanent liking. Not even Avhen, turning back one forenoon for something in the closet which he had forgotten, he found her in tears on the low ledge of the open window at the foot of the staircase. \" Good heavens ! Miss Ashton, Avhat is the matter ? Are you ill ? Is anything troubling you ? \" \" Nothing,\" sobbed she, the clear drops falling faster, \" Nothing ! oh, Miss Ashton, this cannot be for nothing,\" and he sat doAvn on the AvindoAV-ledge beside her, not daring so much as to touch her hand, his own Avere in such a quiver. \" Miss Ashton \u2014 Augusta \u2014 you told me your troubles Avhen you Avere a school-girl, am I less worthy your confidence noAV ? Can I do anything to serve you ? I would lay my life down to save you from pain ; \" and the earnest tenderness of his voice spoke volumes. She had subdued her emotion. Gathering herself up with a reflex of her mother's stateliness, she said haughtily, \" It is nothing, sir, I am better,\" and SAvept past him up the staircase, leaving him to set his teeth and turn away Avith clenched hands, alike exasperated at his own loss of self-command and grieved for her grief. On the narrow landing which ran parallel with the staircase like a balcony, Augusta found her cousin Ellen, with one hand on her side, leaning against the chamber door-post, as if for support, with closed eyes and pale lips.

But the process closed his eyes and ears to external sounds, and the old postman, with his long tin horn, which had been echoing through the straggling village a full quarter of an hour, passed him in the avenue and said, \" Good day,\" without so much as arresting his attention.

It Avas late Avhen he got home to dinner. Ellen and Bess were both on the look-out for him. He quickened his pace, fearing some evil to his beloved Augusta, whom he had last seen in tears. \" What an anomaly is woman ! \" he thought, as he found her fingers rattling over the keys of her piano in accompaniment to the merriest ditty he had heard from her lips since she was a child."], [428, "The Manchester man. 340 There was a strange sparkle in her eyes, a vivacity in her manner so opposed to her sadness that he asked himself if he had been dreaming before, or Avas dreaming then. She blushed OA-er her AvilloAv-pattern plate as she took her seat, but, after that first token of susceptibility, chatted Avith a volubility unusual to her, and curiously in contradistinction to the silence and reserve of Ellen ChadAvick.

Had these two been incipient lovers, no more embarrassing silence could have fallen upon them. If Jabez, her junior by two years, had had a tussle to keep his love Avithin bounds, there had at least been a glimmer of hope in the distance, and the struggle was upAvards. Ellen had been trained from her childhood to keep her naturally strong feelings under control, but there was a Avar in her breast between maidenly shame and unsought, hopeless love, and the two hacked at each other and at her heart in the rayless dark, and the struggle was doAvnAvards. Here she Avas, for the first time, alone with the man she loved with all the strength of a strong heart, Avith the newly gained knoAvledge that he \" would die to save her cousin pain ;\" and he, conscious of a sacred and delicate mission, all unaware of her secret love for himself, Avas perplexed how best to approach the subject and take advantage of the opportunity so afforded him. At length \"I had a letter from my friend Captain Travis to-day,\" he began. With little perceptible emotion, she replied \u2014"], [430, "The Manchester Man. 342 \" Indeed ! I hope he Avas in good health. You are honoured in your friendship, sir.

He told the story of the big, raw-boned youth's first patronage of himself, and found an attentive listener as he traced the groAvth of their friendship upwards, and related favourable anecdotes Avhich have no place in this history. But no sooner did he begin to plead his friend's cause Avith all the Avarmth of young friendship, than her manner entirely changed.

A lichen-covered old tree trunk, shattered and uptorn in the late thunderstorms, Avas at hand ; he seated her upon it, bringing Avater to revive her from a runnel near ; but any attempt to renew the subject only seemed to give her exquisite pain, and he desisted on her telling him, in a suffocating voice \" Honour forbids that I should listen to Mr. Travis ; I\u2014 I\u2014 love another.\" Something in her tone or manner told him that her love Avas as hopeless as his own for Augusta, and nothing could be more respectful and gentle than his bearing towards her on their homeAvard way, thus adding fuel to the fire Avhich consumed her. The evening shadoAvs Avere fast closing in when they reached the cottage, and she, Avith a simple inclination of the head, left Jabez on the threshold, and, passing through the parlours, carried her overmastering emotions upwards to her room, to be grappled with in the silence of the night."], [431, "The Manchester Man. 343 \"Wheere's Miss Ashton?\" asked Bess. \"Hoo said it Avur too hot to bide i' th' heawse, and hoo put her irons deaAvn, an' after tittivatin' hersel' oop a bit, went eawt a-seekin' yo'.\" In some surprise, not unmixed with alarm, for the hour was late \u2014 as times and country Avent \u2014 and the harvest brought rough strangers into the neighbourhood, Jabez set off at full speed doAvn the avenue, and ere he had reached the first brook, saAV her lithe figure advancing buoyantly, and, if his eyes and the gathering mist did not deceive him, a second figure parted from her at the gate.

The morning post had brought a message to Simon Clegg concerning fruit and vegetables for the Manchester home, and having sought him in the kitchen-garden to deliver it, Jabez entered the house at dinner-time by the loAver staircase window (frequently used for entrance and exit). His passage through the best parlour Avas arrested by voices in the room beyond, one of Avhich he kneAv too Avell. It Avas that of Laurence Aspinall. His painting was evidently under free criticism, and had been for some time. There Avas some jesting at the sign-painter. \"You see, Miss Ashton, what a few touches can effect!\" The speaker had apparently made free Avith Clegg's colours and brushes, and there Avas a murmured sound of assent from Miss Ashton. \"Well, Barret, Nee scire fas est omnia ; Ne sutor ultra crepidani What say you?\" \"Yes; let the cobbler stick to his last. If this Clegg would be an artist, let him stick to his brush ; if a tradesman, let him stick to his trade. If a man means to succeed, he must never Hirt with either art or trade.

The blow Avhich had been aimed at his art-pretensions drove him back by the Avay he came, and he paced the long terrace parallel with the \" Lovers' Walk \" for fully half-an-hour.

The path Avas rarely used, the farmer having made a nearer cut from the farmyard to his ancient dwelling. Tom Hulme was slowly recovering, under the care of a Buxton doctor Avho came thrice a week. He could Avalk about the garden with a stick, but there was no sending him to the dark cellar for anything. The doctor had ordered him port wine, and Bess, Avho kept the key, had asked Mr. Clegg to fetch a couple of bottles from the cellar. Tea was over, but he fancied there Avas sufficient light to guide him Avithout a lantern. He had got the wine, and Avas approaching the cellar door at the foot of the sunken steps when he heard the sound of voices coming along the Avalk from the direction of the moor. Every pulse in his body seemed to grow still as he recognised the tones of Augusta Ashton and Laurence Aspinall, and heard Avith deepening anguish the unmistakable sound of kisses interchanged.

He heard her tell that Jabez Clegg had found her sobbing at the separation, even Avhilst her darling's letter was at the gate.

Augusta Ashton, with all her sentimental romance, all her petulant Avilfulness, all her resentment at being exiled from home and her Adonis, yet loved her parents well, although her reverence and filial obedience had been gradually undermined by the plausible sophistry and impassioned eloquence of her ardent lover. But if she loved them much, she unfortunately, loved Laurence more.

Before ten Jabez, sad at heart, had quietly left the cottage for the mill, had saddled Peveril, and, though no great horseman, was speeding past the \"White Hart\" along the highway to Manchester, fast as the steady-going roadster would travel. The wind had risen, and the rain came down persistently ; but, heedless of discomfort or danger, Avith the one thought paramount in his mind \u2014 the preservation of his master's daughter \u2014 he set his teeth and rode on Avith feverish impatience, Avhich at length communicated itself to Peveril, and quickened the beat of the sensible animal's hoof; impatience Avhich Avould have sent him flying over the toll-gates,"], [439, "The Manchester Man. 351 had either he or his steed been equal to the exploit, and which could barely brook the delay of drowsy tollkeepers.

It is never pleasant to be the bearer of ill-tidings, so no Avonder Jabez hesitated Avith the lion-headed knocker in his hand ere he sent its reverberations growling through the silent house.

And I protest I had no double motive in my journey hither.\" The genial smallware manufacturer, to Avhom that night had brought two revelations, looked Jabez steadfastly in the face as he made his avowal ; then, taking him kindly by the hand, said \u2014 his eyes SAvimming \"Just so, just so, my lad! I believe you. And, Jabez Clegg, let me tell you that I would rather give my daughter to an upright, persevering man like you, Avithout a penny, than to a spendthrift like Laurence Aspinall, though he rolled in riches. But it is no use saying that now'.' Indeed there Avas no use, and time was flying. A glance of grateful attachment, and a mute pressure of his liberal master's AA"], [442, "Thb Manchester Man. 354 hand, were the sole acknowledgment of Jabez. But a new bond was established betAveen the twain. Mrs. Ashton had come back to discuss Avith her husband and Jabez the best mode of procedure. She was not less shrewd than her lord, and had not failed to perceive that the young man's heart Avas in the service he now rendered them. The blow dealt by Augusta to her pride dashed doAvn the impalpable barrier between them and she took counsel Avith him as a tried and true friend. Mr. Clegg pointed out the necessity for his return to the mill before it should open, and he be missed ; and taking a proffered glass of brandy and water to avert cold, he hurried, Avhilst hot coffee was preparing, to change his soaked garments preparatory to the ride back ; his elders also taking the opportunity to dress and prepare for departure with the morning coach. Not a moment was wasted, but though Peveril had been well groomed and fed, he was not so fresh to the road as he had been ; still the journey Avas homeAvard, the rain had abated ; day began to dawn as he left Stockport behind, and without much use of the Avhip, Jabez had his horse back in the stable before the factory bell began to ring. And then the beast was allowed to rest. The jaded matt had to rouse himself to another day's Avork, another day's trial and excitement, Avithout a moment for repose. To everybody's astonishment, Mr. and Mrs. Ashton stepped out of the \" Lord Nelson \" coach that morning at the bottom of the avenue, Avith a carpet-bag for luggage. The difference of their reception by daughter and niece was palpable, and they could not fail to observe hoAv much the former was disconcerted by their arrival. \"Oh, aunt and uncle, this is a pleasant surprise!\" exclaimed Ellen, running doAvn the avenue to meet them,"], [443, "The Manchester Man. 355 \" You do not appear very well pleased to see us, Augusta,\" remarked Mrs. Ashton, as she met her lazily sauntering through the garden towards them, as captivating in her printed morning dress as a sleepless night, an anxions headache, and her unmis takable confusion would permit the recognised beauty to be. \"Oh, yes, I am pleased enough, but I should have been better pleased if you had AA'ritten instead of coming upon one so suddenly. It is quite startling!\" and the petulance of her tone gave effect to the pettish frown on her brow. \"My dear, ill thoughts make ill looks,\" said Mrs. Ashton, gravely, with a searching glance. \"What is the matter with you this morning ? Nothing serious, I hope.\" The very inquiry apparently annoyed her, \" Oh, I've got a headache, that's all. I heard a man's foot on the gravel-walk long after everyone was in bed, and I got a fright.\" \" I think it Avas only Crazy Joe \u2014 he hangs about at all hours,\" put in Ellen, who had not heard the crunch of Mr. Clegg's heel on the gravel, as he stood for a moment under their window, to breathe a prayer for the safety and well-being of the supposed sleeper, before he turned away swiftly on his errand. Almost Mr. Ashton's first inquiry was for Mr. Clegg. \" He's at the mill, sir. He was off afore any on us was up ; an' he said happen he mightna git whome fur breakfast, he wur so busy,\" was the reply of Bess. But Mr. Ashton, setting off towards the factory, encountered Jabez on the way, and they returned together to breakfast, as if they had met for the first time that morning. On Mrs. Ashton's suggestion, Augusta Avas neither questioned nor accused. \" We should only tempt her to deny, and perhaps provoke ill-will towards our informant, with no good end,\" she said. \" Better wait and ascertain beyond question Avhat her intentions are.\""], [444, "356 the Manchester man. Jabez Avould fain have spared her the pain and shame of exposure, but the matter Avas out of his hands. The day passed unmarked save by Augusta's restless look-out for Crazy Joe, and the way she hung about her mother, as if half afraid of the rash step she contemplated. Mr. Ashton meanwhile, to cover his distress and agitation, busied himself about the transfer of the \"White Hart\" (Avhich he pronounced \"admirable\") to its place oA'er the inn-door, and managed to elicit from Chapman, the gossiping landlord, without direct inquiry, that a fine young spark in hunting gear had put up his horse there several times Avithin the past Aveek, and Avas ike to make the fortune of Crazy Joe, he gave the poor softy so many half-crowns; but Joe was \"deep, and never let on what he got them for.\""], [445, "CHAPTER THE THIRTY-EIGHTH.

She had promised to meet him at that entrance of the Lovers' Walk which opened below Yeardsley Hall Farm into Moor Lane, Avhilst, the lane being a steep declivity, he Avas to keep the post-chaise in Avaiting at the foot. Her headache served as an excuse for retiring to bed earlier than her cousin, and scarcely could her father and mother restrain themselves as she kissed them lingeringly before she Avent. Indeed, Mr. Ashton Avould much have preferred to \" have it out with the girl at once, and have done Avith it,\" there not being much \" waiting \" blood in his veins. He had kept out of her sight most of the day, fidgeting over one thing and another, Avhilst his Avaistcoat and shirt-frill bore testimony to the constant raid on his snuff-box. \" I don't like to see my poor lass trapped like a bird in a cage,\" he said in confidence to Jabez, whose opinion he already knew agreed Avith his OAvn, as did the desire to \" thrash the infernal scoundrel Avithin an inch of his life.\" The last straAv had broken the camel's back, and Jabez Avas no longer inclined to be passive. Laurence had bid Augusta take no care for her wardrobe ; his purse was ample, and he would dress her like a queen if she Avould only consent to fly Avith him. So, after collecting a few immediate necessaries and trinkets, and placing the reticule which contained them out of sight, she crept into bed, to lie and listen for the household to folloAV her example. How lazily the hours lagged ! She heard old Simon shuffling about, and the creaking of his camp-bedstead as he settled his old rheumatic bones for the night, but the firm foot of Jabez she did not hear, though the house clock struck nine, and Ellen came up Avith the last stroke."], [447, "Thb Manchester man. 359 In ansAver to a question, Ellen said that Mr. Clegg Avas asleep on the squab, and that she understood he had slept there the previous night, to be able to go to the mill very early Avithout disturbing anyone else. \" I saw him as he lay there, Avhere he had fallen asleep shortly after tea, and I have been speaking to my uncle about him ; he looks so dreadfully worn and jaded, I am sure he is either killing himself Avith overwork or has some great trouble on his mind,\" and a deep sigh followed this expression of opinion. Augusta was silent. Something within her secret heart whispered that the trouble of Jabez Clegg Avould be intensified sevenfold by her act of that night, and, haughty as she was betimes, she pitied him. And Avhatever Avere her compunctions, fears, or emotions, Jabez certainly shared Avith her parents in her thoughts. Ellen slept. The clock struck ten. Father and mother entered their room, and through the door which Augusta had artfully requested Ellen to \" leave open on account of the heat \" came the sound of their voices in Ioav but earnest converse \u2014 \" You leave her to me, William,\" spoken with decision, being the only words she could distinguish, though she heard her father walk about for some time. Indeed, she thought he would never go to bed. Eleven ! She slipped stealthily from the side of her sleeping cousin, and by the light of the moon, clear enough to-night, dressed as noiselessly and rapidly as her trepidation Avould permit. From habit she knelt to pray, but as she came to the passage, \" Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,\" a neAV meaning seemed to flash through the words, and she half wavered in her purpose. \" Poor Jabez ! \" she murmured to herself, as she caught up her shoes and reticule, and listened in the open doorway for"], [448, "360 The Manchester Man. the deep breathing Avhich came from behind the dimity curtains of the four-post bed. Re-assured, she stepped lightly across the room in her stocking-feet, turned the drop-handle of that chamber door as silently as the squeaking latch Avould permit, and fled swiftly doAvn the stairs, sitting doAvn at the bottom to put on her shoes. She had raised the sash, and was in the very act of stepping over the low Avindow-sill, Avhen a foot Avas heard on the stair, and, turning her head, she saw her mother fully dressed, close by her side, and felt her slight wrist grasped as in a vice. \"Is this your filial love and obedience, misguided girl? Is this the result of Madame Broadbent's training ?

Could you not think that chastity is the brightest jeAvel in a Avoman's crown, and the soonest dimmed, that you Avere ready to leave your character at the mercy of every gossip Avho had a tongue to Avag ? \" She had drawn Augusta, too much stunned to speak, into the parlour close at hand, and had shut the doors \u2014 a needless precaution, seeing how remote were all sleepers. A few words of gentle motherly inquiry might have softened impulsive, tender hearted Augusta to tears, and turned the whole current of her life ; but Mrs. Ashton's stateliness had become sternness, and, fresh from the evil teaching of Laurence Aspinall, her daughter's proud spirit rose in rebellion, and answered her. \" We are going to be married. And I Avas not going with Laurence alone. Cicily Avas to travel Avith us.

And now go to your room, Augusta, and thank God you have been saved from disgrace this night, and thank us that Ave have kept you from open exposure. Not even your cousin has a notion of this last folly. Our daughter's honour is dearer to us than to herself,\" and the mother's tone softened as she spoke. \"Your daughter's honour has never been in any danger,\" said Augusta, haughtily, as she swept from the room, to encounter at the foot of the stairs, flooded by moonlight through the open window, her father \u2014 and Jabez."], [450, "362 Thb Manchester Man. Up to that moment she had stood on the defensive, her Avayward spirit upholding and arming her for retort. The sight of the father who had indulged her every Avhim, and of Jabez, whose esteem she valued more than she herself knew, gave a sudden shock to her overwrought nerves, and she fell forward into the arms of Jabez in a deep swoon. Tenderly, respectfully, sadly, he bore her into the parlour, and placing her on the sofa, relinquished her to her mother, divesting himself of his shoes in order to procure Avater to restore her Avithout creating alarm. When she recovered he Avas gone ; she Avas alone with the parents whose counsels she had despised, Avhose love she had AA'ounded ; herself detected and humiliated. A greater humiliation had fallen to the lot of elate, enamoured, and self-satisfied Laurence Aspinall, Avhen, leaving his friend Barret with the post-chaise, their saddle-horses, and Cicily at the bottom of Moor Lane, he mounted the hill and whistled softly at the entrance of the Lovers' Walk, to call forth \u2014 not a blushing maiden, half afraid of her OAvn temerity, but \u2014 two justly incensed and indignant men. His loAv-voiced \" Augusta \u2014 \" died upon his lips ; he recoiled, stammered \u2014 \" You ! I \u2014 I did not expect D \u2014 nation ! What brought you here?

Am I to meet you at every turn? I suppose you want Miss Ashton for yourself, but I'll baulk you yet!\" and, but that Jabez had a quick eye and hand, his riding-whip would have seamed the Iatter's manly face. Jabez dexterously caught the light whip, and Avrenched it from him, a simultaneous sharp bloAV of Mr. Ashton's bamboo on Aspinall's shoulders tending to loosen his grasp. And then the two young men, with all the fever of jealousy added to old animosity, closed and grappled Avith each other as might a lion and a tiger in the arena. And Mr. Ashton, his love of fair play yielding to his exasperation, made good use of his bamboo whenever he could deal a blow Avithout harming Jabez. The tAvo combatants were not unequally matched ; there was little difference in size and Aveight, but the scientific skill of Laurence had more than a counterpoise in the nerve and muscle of Jabez, strengthened by exercise and a temperate life, whilst vicious courses had somewhat impaired his own athletic frame. The struggle on the steep hill-side was too deadly for noise. At length Laurence \u2014 himself booted and spurred \u2014 in striving to take an unfair advantage and rip the unprotected calves of Jabez with the rowels of his spurs, lost his foothold, and Avas borne to the earth, falling heavily. He lay on the ground stunned and motionless. At once Jabez, Avith a swift revulsion of feeling, knelt down by the side of his prostrate foe, and raised his head, Mr. Ashton bending over them inquiringly, just as Barret, Avhom curiosity and impatience had drawn from his post beloAV, came on the scene.

The hat had rolled doAvnhill, to be crushed under the Avheels of the chaise ; the wig and broken Avhip were found the next morning by Crazy Joe, who exercised his Avitless head respecting them and the trampled ground to small purpose ; then brought them to his friend Sim as playthings. Had they fallen into the hands of a reasoning mortal, much more perplexity, and a very serious mystery, might have been the result. Buxton being only five miles from Whaley Bridge, Barret again made his appearance in the neighbourhood of the \"White Hart,\" whilst the neAV sign still attracted rustic admirers; and, finding no rumours current respecting the occurrence of the preceding night, he rode off again, having first committed to Crazy Joe a scarcely decipherable missive from the discomfited lover to the not less disconsolate damsel."], [455, "The Manchester Man, 365 The evening coach bore the Ashtons and Ellen back to Manchester ; Augusta, still in a rebellious mood, the cause of which, being hidden from her cousin, occasioned the latter no little perplexity.

With that misleading letter of his before her, no wonder if the \"blood shed for her sweet sake\" converted the hero into the martyr, and placed Jabez and her father in the category of cruel persecutors. It did more. It erected a barrier against reconciliation. In vain her placable father held out a flag of truce ; she kept aloof resentfully, though in the solitude of her own chamber she gave way, and wept at her isolation from all who loved her. Mrs. Ashton, whose sense of propriety had been outraged, whose maternal pride had received a terrible shock, was less readily disposed to condone her daughter's offence; and, being a better business Avoman than a psychologist, her tactics showed none of her ordinary shrewdness.

Instead, never was the golden fruit of the Hesperides more vigilantly guarded. She was kept much Avithin doors. There Avas no Cicily to sympathise or convey clandestine billet-doux. The modern notion that a daily airing is indispensable had not been promulgated, or had not become the creed of the manufacturing community. Mrs. Ashton had \" no leisure for gadding,\" and Augusta cared little to drive in the gig with only James for her charioteer, or even to walk Avith Ellen, so long as the mulberry-coloured livery was in attendance.

Meamvhile, Tom Hulme had resumed his duties at Whaley Bridge Mill, and Jabez returned home to his. Much to Augusta's surprise, he Avas not only invited to dine Avith them on the day of his return, but to take his place henceforth at their board as one of the family.

He knew nothing of Aspinall's letter, or that he was accused of a \"ruffianly attack ;\" he only felt that he would have died to serve her, and had done what he had to save her from life-long misery, without a single thought of keeping her for himself.

In order that Tabitha might obtain repose, Mr. Clegg usually remained until a late hour, Mrs. Ashton herself entrusting him with a latch-key on these occasions. One night, tOAvards the middle of October, Avhen Joshua had been more than ordinarily crusty, and Jabez did not quit the classic corner until the \" wee short hour ayont the twal,\" he was struck as he turned the corner from Market Street into Mosley Street to find Mr. Aspinall's carriage in waiting with four horses and postilions. He stood still for a moment to re-assure himself, but carriages were not so common that he should mistake that particular one ; and his heart drummed an alarm within his breast, Hurrying on with sad misgivings, he passed two tall figures muffled in cloaks, Avhom he had no difficulty in recognising, from build and walk, to be the Aspinalls, father and son ; and increasing"], [464, "The Manchester Man. 374 his speed he gained the door, inserted his key in the latch, and Avas on the stairs before the cloaked individuals had finished their speculations respecting his being a robber escaped from a constable. Formerly, Augusta had to pass his room door to reach her own, on the opposite side of the long corridor. Her new chamber Avas next to his own, and nearer to the staircase. A thin stream of light shot through the key-hole, and a bright narrow line cast upon the opposite wall shoAved the door ajar. He stood still in his surprise. As if a tipsy, musically-disposed man were going past, the refrain of a rollicking song Avas trolled out in the street ; and then Augusta, equipped as for a journey, came forth from her chamber to descend the stairs. She had calculated on the signal an hour earlier, and expected Jabez an hour later. As she stole on tiptoe down the stairs Jabez confronted her and barred her progress. Her silver candlestick dropped from her hand, Avith the one word \" Again !\" and rolling doAvn with a clang, awakened Mr. and Mrs. Ashton, the only sleepers on that floor, and set Nelson barking furiously. They Avere in the dark, but he had caught her hand. \" Miss Ashton, this is infatuation \u2014 madness.\" \"No matter, sir, let me pass; you have no right to detain me!\" \"But I have, miss,\" said her father coming behind, guided by their voices, his scant apparel as invisible in the gloom as himself. \"Is this another attempt to disgrace us by eloping? Oh, my child, my child, you are breaking your poor old father's heart!\" \" And mine ! \" floated like the echo of despair's last sigh from the lips of Jabez. But the utter hopelessness of the old man's tone touched a sensitive chord of Augusta's soul, and turning, she fell upon his"], [465, "The Manchester Man. 375 neck crying tearfully, \" Oh, forgive me, father, forgive me. I did not think you would take it so much to heart.\" The appeal of affection to affection had accomplished what reason and authority had failed to effect."], [466, "CHAPTER THE FORTIETH. AATTH ALL HIS FAULTS. UGUSTA'S penitence exhaled like deAv from a floAver. In the light of her mother's lofty displeasure her tears dried, and self-will once more exerted its pre-eminence. She locked herself in her own room, and resolutely refused to come forth. \" So long as that odious meddler, Jabez Clegg, remains under our roof, I will stay here ; A DYING GIFT and if you will not consent to my marriage Avith Laurence Aspinall, I will starve myself to death ! \" was her angry declaration, as she closed the door and turned the key. \" Leave her alone,\" said Mrs. Ashton, \" she will want her food before her food wants her ; and a little wholesome solitude is good for reflection. She will change her mind before the day closes.\" This was at mid-da}' ; but night came, and another noon, yet there was no sign of Miss Ashton's appearance ; and Mrs. Ashton had made no overtures to her refractory daughter. The tender hearted father was in a pitiable state of perturbation. In and"], [467, "Thb Manchester Man. 377 out the Avarehouse he Avas twenty times in the day \u2014 as Kezia observed, \"For a' th' Avorld like a hen on a hot griddle;\" and his snuff-box was hardly ever out of his hand. Business seemed altogether beyond his grasp ; he answered questions at random, or was unconscious when addressed. To this state of trouble Jabez unintentionally contributed his quota. Over the tea-table, unenlivened by Augusta's sparkling presence, though she was the one sole topic of conversation \u2014 he said, and not Avithout an effort \u2014 \" It has occurred to me, and I have thought the matter well over, that since my unfortunate position in relation to late events has made my very presence obnoxious to Miss Ashton it might be better for all concerned if I were to shift my quarters Avithout delay. There are lodgings vacant close at hand ; and I have no right to linger here and disturb the peace of any one member of your kind family.\" \" Jabez Clegg,\" remonstrated Mr. Ashton, with Avide-open eyes. \" Have you any other reason to be dissatisfied with present arrangements ? \" asked Mrs. Ashton stiffly. \" Oh ! Mrs. Ashton, how can I have ? This house has been my home for years, and such a home as rarely falls to the lot of the fatherless. To you, my benefactors, I owe everything \u2014 almost myself; and I should ill repay your uniform kindness by remaining to create discord.\" \" If your only desire to remove is to gratify Miss Ashton's whims, you will oblige me, Mr. Clegg, by remaining,\" replied Mrs. Ashton, with grave decision ; whilst Mr. Ashton, looking the very picture of consternation, laid his hand upon the young man's sleeve, and said slowly \u2014 \" My lad, you have been one of the household for many years ; do not be the first to make a breach in the family. If the child"], [468, "378 Thb Manchester Man. of our blood and our affections goes forth to strangers wilfully, and repudiates us, do not let the son of our adoption leave us to lament her loss in solitude.\" This was strong language, but Mrs. Ashton did not gainsay it, and Mr. Clegg could not longer press the point, though his oavii pain was intensified by the fear of adding to the distress of Augusta, Avho, he Avas confident, regarded him as an interloper and a mischief-maker. Little had been seen of Ellen since the return from Carr Cottage. A message despatched by Mrs. Ashton to her sister, in her dilemma, was ansAvered by another to pray them to \"excuse Miss Chadwick, Avho Avas not well enough to go out.\" This someAvhat disconcerted Mrs. Ashton, Avho, more alarmed than she would admit, and disturbed by the restless uneasiness of her husband, had looked for Ellen to act as a mediator Avithout any compromise of her OAvn dignity. At the close of the second day, as Augusta pertinaciously refused to open the door, at the instance of Jabez the lock was forced; and even then a barrier of chairs and boxes had to be thrust back by sheer strength. She was exhausted from Avant of food, but her will was indomitable, and neither her father's entreaties, nor her mother's commands could induce her to partake of the viands spread before her. Jabez was in agony. Delicacy and her obvious dislike had kept him from intruding upon her privacy, but as hour after hour Avas added to the night, and Augusta persistently dashed aside the food placed to her lips, he joined his prayers to those of her father, and neither availing, rushed out of the house, and in less than a quarter of an hour returned with Dr. Hull. He Avas not a man to stand any nonsense. \" Here, sir,\" \u2014 to Jabez \u2014 \" you are young and strong. Hold the silly child's arms Avhilst her teeth are forced apart. If she"], [469, "The Manchester man. 379 will no take food, she shall take physic, and see which she likes the best.\" But the struggle to nourish her frame through set teeth was prolonged and painful, and the parents Avere likely to yield before the child. Servants may be faithful, but they have eyes and ears, and not always discreet tongues. Family matters discussed freely in the kitchen before apprentices found their Avay into the warehouse and beyond it, and Mrs. Ashton's nerves tingled when she became acquainted with the rumours afloat. From Tim, the Ashton stable-boy, Aspinall's emissary (Bob the groom, once more in his old service) had no difficulty in obtaining all the information his young master required. Laurence waylaid Mr. Ashton, inquired anxiously after the obstinate girl's health, and, having paved the way by as much contrition as he thought necessary, called at the house the following morning, in company with his father, to renew proposals for Miss Ashton's hand. Worn out by Augusta's obstinacy, which she and Laurence agreed to call \"constancy,\" father and mother were in a different frame of mind to receive this proposition than when they had given their former peremptory rejection. They were not one whit more convinced by Mr. Laurence's assurance that he meant to \" reform,\" or Mr. Aspinall's quotation of the adage, \" A reformed rake makes the best husband ; \" but, rather than see their child starve herself to death before their very eyes, they yielded, and Laurence Aspinall, profuse alike in thanks and professions, Avas permitted by aching hearts and reluctant lips to introduce Augusta to his father then and there as his bride elect. It was a moment of triumph for Laurence Avhen Augusta refused to come down stairs without an assurance under his own"], [470, "380 The Manchester Man. hand. He pencilled on a card, \" My Augusta, I Avait for you, \u2014 Laurence.\" And presently, supported by a maid-servant, she entered the room, her dress of purple poplin serving to show Iioav wan and transparent her fair skin had grown, how unnatural Avas the brilliance of her eyes, She Avould have fallen, as much from Aveakness as emotion, on her entrance into the parlour, but that Laurence darted forward and caught her in an embrace which brought back somewhat of her lost colour ; and if anything could have softened the pain of that hour to her parents, it Avas the apparent ardour and sincerity of the lover, the hope that a genuine passion might tend to Avean him from his old habits and associates. Mr. Aspinall's reception of Augusta was characteristic. \" My charming Miss Ashton, I see my son has brought back the roses to your cheeks. May they never fade again, but bloom perennially Avithout a thorn ! I rejoice to kiss your hand paternally on this auspicious occasion, and to assure you that I shall be proud to Avelcome such beauty, and such constancy, as the Avife of my noble son.\" Consent once obtained, the Aspinalls were as eager to press forward the marriage as the Ashtons were to retard it, neither her father nor mother affecting a satisfaction they did not feel. \" My dear,\" said the latter to Augusta one day, Avhen her eyes were sparkling over a costly present just received from Laurence, \"your father Avas in hopes you would have fixed your heart on some good steady man like Jabez Clegg, who would have been a comfort and a credit to all of us, and have kept the business in the family after Ave Avere in our graves.\" \" Pshaw, mamma ? hoAv preposterous ! I am surprised at my father's infatuation for that young man. I esteem him quite sufficiently for a friend, but \" \u2014 and she locked an emerald earring in her delicate ear \u2014 \"I could not exist with a husband whose"], [471, "The Manchester man. 381 heart was in his business. My husband's heart must hold me, and me only ; and I must have something to look at as Avell as to love.\" \"Ah! Augusta, it must be a very small heart indeed which cannot find room both for a wife and a business to maintain her fittingly. The sheen of a dress which must last a life is of less consequence than its durable texture.\" \" Well, mamma, so long as the material pleases my eyes, I will take the wear upon trust. And do not be surprised that your daughter prefers a fine man and a gentleman to one Avhose fortune is in the clouds, and whose origin is so obscure he has not even a name to call his own.\" She Avas standing to admire herself and her neAV jeAvellery in the Venetian glass between the windows as she said this, and her mother's figure filling in the frame, Jabez Clegg came and went unseen, a pang in his heart and an intensified resolve to make both fortune and name for himself even though his master's daughter vanished from his vision. Nothing would induce Mr. Ashton to part Avith his child until she Avas at least eighteen ; and in that particular he was proof against the importunities of Laurence and the cajoleries of Augusta. So for ten months (during which the laAvyers had ample time to quarrel over the settlement of Augusta's \u00a318,000, so that too much or too little should not be tied down on the lady) the dashing young blade was on his trial, so to speak, and contrived to beguile both father and mother of their prejudices ; Avhilst to Augusta a new world of gaiety Avas opened out. As her daughter's chaperon, Mrs. Ashton renewed her acquaint ance with the yellow satin cushions of the Assembly Rooms, the Gentlemen's Concerts discoursed sweet music in their ears, Miss Ashton could take her seat in the boxes of the Theatre Royal without fear of Madame Broadbent's fan, and Kezia was in her"], [472, "382 Thb Manchester Man. glory, so many balls and parties had to be catered for ; and Mr. Laurence Aspinall was in the ascendant. All this Avas inexpressibly painful to Jabez, but as he had Avritten to Ben Travis that \"there Avas something more for men to do than die of disappointment or blighted love,\" so he set his face like a rock against the breakers, and gave himself entirely to business. He said to himself it would be cowardice to flee from that which must be borne and mastered, so never another word Avas heard of his seeking a home elseAvhere. If he Avas brave, he Avas not foolhardy enough to court pain in the sight of his rival's triumph, and though in his determination to \" stick to his last,\" he had eschewed all art which came not Avithin the scope of pattern designing, to that he turned Avith redoubled assiduity after business hours, having found a profitable market apart from Mr. Ashton's firm, as his account Avith the Savings Bank in Cross Street had borne witness from the date of its establishment in January, 1818. But for a brief space, and that Avhilst the Avound was raw and new, his ministrations to the dying chaplain of the Old Church not only carried him out of sight and hearing, but in a measure drew his thoughts away from his own sorrow. Once only did Joshua scarify the sore. In an interval of pain he said Avith his customary abruptness \u2014 \"And so that pretty lass of thy master's is going to throw herself away on the wild rascal Avho pitched thee over the Avail?\" Jabez could not trust himself to ansAver save by a movement of his head. Ugh! she'd better ha' takken a fancy to thee!\" Half-an-hour or more elapsed. Waking from a doze, he said \" Dost thou remember my telling thee to look at ' Hogarth's Apprentice ' in Chadwick's parlour ? \""], [473, "The Manchester Man. 383 \" Indeed, I do ! Those pictures have influenced my life,\" answered Mr. Clegg Avith a sigh, pouring out a dose of medicine as he spoke. \"More physic, eh? Ugh! doctors kill more than they cure with their stuff! Ay, lad, thah'st mounted up, thou'lt be a master thyself some day, if thou dost not forget that Jabez must be an honourable man !\" \" I never did forget it sir, even though the apprentice boy was mad enough to aspire to his master's daughter! But losing her, I have learned a neAV lesson. The prayer of the clden Jabez, which has been mine night and morn from boyhood, Avas a prayer for self, and self only, and I had no right to look for an ansAver to all the hopes I based upon it. If I have not been 'kept from evil,' and it has 'grieved me,' I prayed for myself alone, and in grief I have my answer. Prayer should take a .wider range,\" \" Right, lad, right ! noAV let me sleep.\" When he waked again he remarked \u2014 \" It's time for thee to be off, Jabez ; but time is running faster with me than thee, lad. Here, reach yon \"Terence\" from the bureau. It is the Edinburgh edition. Keep it for the sake of the rough old Parson who gave thee thy name. And take care of it. Good night. How thick the fog is!\" He had lost the sight of one eye, and the other was rapidly going. That Avas the ninth of November. When Jabez came again on the eleventh, the fog had cleared aAvay from Joshua Brookes's sight for ever; and fountains of tears ran freely from many eyes for the hot, hasty, single-minded, and learned Parson Avhose name Avas a household word in the town, and who had ever been a kind friend to Jabez. In his life he had been at Avar Avith huckster-women, street-urchins, school-boys, and his ecclesiastical brethren. In his death the wide parish, and more than the parish, united to reverence his memory, those who had laughed loudest at his eccentricities being foremost to bewail him,"], [474, "384 Thb Manchester Man. Even the November clouds hung thick and heavy as a pall over the Old Church and churchyard, croAvded Avith mourners, when his silent remains Avere carried to their bed in the cross aisles his feet had trodden so many active years, and if others besides Jabez shed tears over the open and honoured grave, there Avas many an old creature mourning in solitude, besides the queer old Avoman, in kerchief and mutch, who sat amongst her SAveets in a closed shop, and lamented that so young a man as Parson Brookes should be carried off before her. \" Well-a-day ! and only sixty-seven ! He'll want no more humbugs, and no more cakes for his pigeons. Poor Jotty ! \" There was no mention of Jabez in his will, but when the young man took the old worn \" Terence \" sadly and reverently down from the shelf where he had first placed it, on turning over its leaves he found a banknote for \u00a3300 pinned to the fly-leaf, on which Avas inscribed his own name and that of the eccentric donor."], [475, "CHAPTER THE FORTY-FIRST MARRIAGE ! \u00bb\u25a0\u25a0 * AD Jabez been vindictive, the opportunity, or at least L^\"^^ the promise of revenge on his successful rival was Jl r not Avanting. Various efforts had been made to call the Manchester Yeomanry to account for their doings at Peterloo, and many had been the overtures and suggestions to Jabez Clegg by members of the Radical party to join in the prosecution of the offenders. But he resolutely refused to identify the trooper Avho struck him, saying \" I forgave the man at the time, believing him to be drunk, and incapable of discrimination. If I have since had reason to think otherwise, I cannot be so mean as to allow private feelings to influence a public act.\" It would be false to say there never Avas a tug at his heart-strings when the tempters Avere again at his elboAV, before they made their final attempt in 1822. But he said to himself \" If it would have been revengeful at the time Avhen the bodily injury was fresh, it would be doubly revengeful, mean, and dishonourable now that he has supplanted me in love. And in striking at him I should wound Augusta, and that must never be.\" The temptation to expose his adversary Avas set aside, and thus it was that Laurence Aspinall's name Avas not added to cc"], [476, "386 The Manchester Man. those of the four defenders on the record of the trial at Lancaster in April ; and as that trial, after the examination of nearly a hundred witnesses of all ranks, terminated unsuccessfully for the prosecution, the forbearance of our friend Jabez spared him at least the mortification of defeat. The year rolled on. At the instance of Mr. Ashton, Jabez Avithdrew the bulk of his deposits from the Savings Bank, and adding to Joshua Brookes's gift the \u00a3200 he had accumulated by working late and early, and saving small sums even during his apprenticeship, placed all in his master's hands to be invested in the business and so return him a higher rate of interest. And this was the first absolute start of Jabez as a capitalist. The joyous excitement attending Augusta's OAvn preparations for her approaching nuptials Avas someAvhat damped by the unaccountable condition of Ellen Chadwick, whose health, instead of improving during her visit to Carr Cottage, had appeared to decline still more perceptibly. A constant pain at her chest, frequent headaches, uncertain spirits, and increasing langour gave Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick real cause for uneasiness ; but Ellen Avould not hear of a doctor, and maintained that it Avas \"nothing to trouble about,\" she would \" be better soon.\" She did not get \"better soon,\" and Avhen the first August sun shone on Augusta's birthday and bridal, it taxed her poAvers to the utmost to sustain efficiently her part as bridesmaid. Had Captain Travis accepted his lieutenant's invitation to be groomsman, she Avould have found it still more difficult ; but a comparative stranger, a Mr. Joseph Bennett, of Gorton, filled the post, the bride's father having objected very decidedly to bold Ned Barret. Yet Ben Travis and Jabez Clegg Avere both among the guests, albeit it cost each a struggle. The tAvo had mutually strengthened each other as such friends should, arriving at the"], [477, "The Manchester Man. 387 Spartan decision to \"suffer and be silent, facing their fate like men.\" And indeed, old Mr. Ashton had wrung the hand of Jabez at least a week before, and said \u2014 \" I'm sorry for you, Clegg ; I am, upon my soul ; and I'm sorry for our poor lass, too, for she's made a mistake. But keep a brave heart, and don't let that slashing yeomanry felloAv crow over you. As Mrs. Ashton Avould say, ' What can't be cured must be endured,' and Ave must all of us shoAv the best face at the Avedding that we can.\" If that meant elaborate display in dress and decorations, and provision for the bridal breakfast and dinner, then the face exhibited Avas a shining one. Mrs. Hodgson, the fashionable mantua-maker and milliner, of Oldham Street (where tAvo or three of the private houses had already been converted into shops), had kept her apprentices at Avork almost night and day for weeks, executing bridal orders from the Ashtons and their friends. A very snowstorm might have passed through the Avorkroom, such heaps of Avhite French crape and satin, lace and organdi, lute-string and gauze, littered and covered available space, putting matronly brocade, velvet, and llama quite into the shade. The warehouse saw little of Mrs. Ashton for a Aveek or ten days previously. Cicily, who had gone over to the Aspinalls, had begged to be alloAved to help Kezia for that occasion, and she roasted her own face in spinning gold and silver Avebs and baskets from sugar for the table, making \"floating islands,\" syllabubs, trifles, jellies, and blanc-mange to supplement the solid dishes Kezia dressed with so much skill. And Mr. Mabbott sent in a sugary \" Temple of Hymen \" and a bride's cake prepared six weeks in advance. The bride, alternately radiant and tearful like an April day, veiled with lace and crowned with Avhite rosebuds and orange-"], [478, "388 the Manchester Man. blossoms, wore a low-bodiced dress of white satin, festooned round the narroAV skirt Avith costly lace, whilst on neck and arms, and in her tiny ears, Avere neglige, bracelets, and earrings of pearl, the gift of the gallant bridegroom's gallant father. The bridegroom Avas scarcely less resplendent in his high collared blue coat and gold buttons, his Avhite waistcoat buttoned to match, his glossy white trousers, and Ioav shoes tied with a bunch of silk ferret. An oblong brooch set with a rim of pearls held doAvn his broad fine shirt-frills ; from his fob hung a huge bunch of gold seals pendant from a flat gold watch chain ; and in his hand (not crushing his elaborate curls, now clustering richly as ever) he carried a hat of Avhite beaver of the newest shape. To Mr. and Mrs. Ashton it Avas a matter of open regret that Joshua Brookes, Avho had christened Augusta, should not have lived to marry her also ; but Mr. Aspinall, whose reminiscences of the old chaplain Avere of another order, was much better satisfied to see his own personal friend, Parson Gatliffe, the bon vivant, behind the altar rails. If the bride Avas tall and graceful, Avith sunshine in her eyes and in her classic curls, tall and stately Avas the bride's mother, whose long train of purple silk velvet SAvept the aisles, though trains had ceased to be general. There Avas no faltering over the responses. There Avas a gloAv of modest pride on the cheek of Augusta ; a look of mingled ardour and exultation on the face of Laurence; his \"/ will\" was pronounced Avith a force Avhich Avas almost fierce, yet, as she faintly promised to \"obey,\" he pressed her hand Avith smiling significance. The ceremony over, the bride did not faint, but turning to her tearful-eyed father, threw her arms around his neck and clung to him, Avhispering hoAv grateful she Avas that he had given her the man of her choice, and that he should see Avhat a good wife"], [479, ""], [480, "\u25baJ < X o 1-1 \u00ab < Q* OS < h 04 O U"], [481, "The Manchester Man. 389 she Avould make ; and the impromptu embrace sent a shower of snuff over white satin and lace. Yet some one fainted, whom Ben Travis caught in his strong arms and carried to the church door for air ; a dark-haired, black eyed bridesmaid, whose face was Avhite and skin transparent as her own robe. Custom had not set its imperative seal on the Avedding tour as a necessity, but after a magnificent solid dinner, to Avhich the party did full justice, and an elaborate dessert, during Avhich the cake was cut, and Mr. Aspinall proposed the health of the bride in an inflated toast, demanding that it should be drunk in bumpers, \"and no heel-taps,\" the wedded pair drove off in Mr. Aspinall's carriage to the family mansion at FalloAvfield, there to spend the honeymoon. \" Good-bye, Jabez,\" said Augusta, putting her small soft hand into his as they left the house ; \" you will comfort my father and mother, will you not ? I trust them to you.\" And he replied Avith the fervency of truth, \" I accept the trust willingly. Good-bye, Mrs. Aspinall\" (how the word choked him !) \" May God bless you, and the marriage you have contracted. Good-bye!\" He did not kiss her hand, had not taken the common liberty of guests to kiss the bride's lips in church ; he did but press her hand as any old friend who had groAvn up with her under the same roof might have done ; but before the carriage had well dashed from the door, or the bridegroom had fairly settled himself on his seat, Laurence turned to the fair young wife, Avhose prophetic tears Avere now falling fast, Avith the sharp rebuke \u2014 \" What was that foundling fellow mumbling over your hand ? You Avill please to remember that that hand is mine now, Mrs. Aspinall. You have promised to love and obey me\u2014 ME your LORD"], [482, "The Manchester Man. 390 and MASTER. And MASTER I mean to be. I have borne the fooling of your friends and your OAvn pretty caprices long enough. It is my turn noAV ; and if any man so much as dares to look at you I'll pound him to a jelly! And noAV dry your eyes and give me a kiss!\" And that was the inauguration of Augusta Apinall's married life. It has been said that the bridesmaid fainted. Every lady carried a smelling bottle, and means to revive her Avere not far to seek. She soon recovered, and Avith a sensitive blush AvithdreAv from the arms which had been so proud to sustain her, casting her eyes round as if in search of some other Avhose service might have been more acceptable. But she suffered no relapse. She Avas ready to wait upon the bride, to sign \" Ellen Chadwick \" in the church register, and to assist a Mr. Joseph Bennett in cutting up the cake for distribution, with cards and gloves, to friends not present. It Avas an arduous task, and she succumbed before it Avas half completed. \" Miss Chadwick, you are not well ; let me relieve you,\" said Jabez, coming to her assistance after the \" happy pair \" had driven off, and Avhilst peals of laughter, shouts, and hurrahs came from the dining-room, Avhere gentlemen Avere honouring the bridal by drinking themselves senseless and speechless. Ellen remained with her aunt a few days longer, during Avhich Jabez, exceedingly pained to see the ravages hidden disease had made in so estimable a young lady, Avas pitifully attentive. He could not, hoAvever, fail to see that his attentions distressed her ; and, on the whole he was not sorry when Augusta's parents and he were left to themselves, to talk of their own dear one and speculate on her future. Weeks went by. Mrs. Aspinall visited her old home, but neA'er without her husband ; and seldom Avas she allowed to"], [483, "The Manchester Man. 391 remain more than an hour. Her spirits seemed exuberant, but somehow her unusual vivacity jarred on her mother's nerves, and she suspected that her spirits were forced. Meanwhile Ellen Chadwick faded. Dr. Hardie, called in at last, watched his patient with curious and attentive eye, perplexed and dubious. He had been friend as well as physician since Mr. Chadwick's attack of paralysis, and was a close observer. Now he came and went in a gossiping sort of way, to put his patient at ease, and off her guard. He Avas there one day Avhen Jabez Avas announced, and saw a sudden spasmodic action of the face, a dilation of the pupils, a scarcely perceptible pant and parting of the lips, and then he Avatched her closer. He introduced Mr. Clegg's name, as if casually, Avhilst his fingers Avere on her pulse. The result of his observations Avere told to Mr. ChadAvick the same day. \" Your daughter has no specific disease, Mr. Chadwick, she is simply love-sick\" \" L-love-s-sick ?\" \" Yes ; and her secret passion is consuming her. Medicine cannot save the patient's life if her affection be not returned, and that right speedily.\" Mr. Chadwick was aghast. \" I feared as much,\" said Mrs. Chadwick, with a sigh. \" Then you will have an inkling who is the desired object ? \" said the doctor. \"I think so.\" \" Does your maternal instinct point to Mr. Clegg ? \" he asked, Avith a curious look. \" It does ; but he himself has no suspicion, and I am sure regards Ellen only as a friend \u2014 a friend elevated a little above him.\" \" Is the young man courting ?"], [484, "Thb Manchester Man. 392 \" I believe not.\" \" Then,\" said the doctor, sententiously, \" the sooner he is, the better for Miss ChadAvick. Her life is not worth a month's purchase unless Mr. Clegg become the buyer. But let not Miss Ellen hear a Avhisper of my opinion. Good day.\" And, snatching up his hat, the doctor departed, leaving them to their reflections. Here Avas a delicate subject to be dealt with, and that AA'ithout either loss of time or the sacrifice of their beloved child's sensitiveness and reserve. UnknoAvn to Ellen, a family conclave assembled under the Mosley Street roof, to discuss the momentous question, and deliberate Avhat Avas best to be done. Long and grave Avere their deliberations. At length, taking Mr. ChadAvick's imperfect speech into consideration, Mr. Ashton consented to lay the case before Jabez, and leave his brother-in-law to supplement it, if necessary ; though opinions Avere divided as to the result.

After a little prelude, in which, whilst enlarging on the serious nature of his niece's illness, he elicited from Jabez that he held the young lady in the very highest esteem, and Avas deeply grieved to hear of her perilous state, he put down his snuff-box on the table before him, and drawing up his chair so as to bring their heads closer together, looked steadfastly into the other's clear eyes as he put the question \u2014"], [485, "Thb Manchester Man. 393 \"And Avhat should you think of love as the cause of her malady ? \" \" LoVE ! \" echoed Jabez, his mind running off to the agonised confession made to him on the Taxal hillside. \"Yes, love, and for the very man whose merits my foolish child failed to see.\" Jabez looked at him vaguely. \" Surely, not Mr. Marsland ! \" \" Pah ! no ! \" exclaimed Mr. Ashton, as if disgusted at his obtuseness. \" Yourself, man \u2014 Jabez Clegg.\" Jabez fixed his eyes on his informant in blank amazement, a monosyllabic long-drawn \" Me I \" being his sole response. \" Just so ! \" assented Mr. Ashton, and he took a pinch of snuff on the strength of it. \" Oh, sir, there must be some mistake !

We may at least soften its asperities for each other.\" The Chadwicks went home Avith minds relieved, but Jabez had stipulated that nothing should be said to Ellen of their overtures to him, no hint given which could alarm her shrinking modesty.

That night she rode home from Jabez Clegg's wedding feast with a groom and a drunken man, pondering whether spirited resentment or tame submission Avas her best course. The morning dawned on a wife pinched black and blue, with hardly strength or spirit to sob. Then followed a reaction, and a period of remorseful uxorious penitence, during which Laurence submitted with a tolerable grace to a lecture from Mr. Aspinall, senior, who saAV that something Avas amiss ; and chivalrous gallantry towards woman being part of this gentleman's creed, he did not spare his son. Nor did Laurence spare himself. He knelt at his wife's feet, called her \" an angel,\" and himself \" a savage,\" implored her forgiveness, excused his jealousy on the ground of passionate love, lavished his means on extravagant gifts for her, and exhausted language in fair promises. But so proud was he of his Avife's beauty, that he must needs exhibit at theatre and assembly the jeAvel he had AA'on; whilst the admiration she excited set his jealous brain on fire, and she paid the penalty in the silence of night, or even in the close carriage driving home. But his contrition and the old plea of \"excessive love\" for his jealous infirmity won her over, and not even Cicily more than suspected half his cruelty. Great preparations had been made at Whaley Bridge for the reception of Mr. and Mrs. Clegg ; the factory windows were extra"], [506, "412 the Manchester man. burnished; the landlord of the \"White Hart\" hoisted a flag; the mill-hands lined the road to greet them ; the avenue gate Avas throAvn open that the chaise might drive on to the cottage; somebody had put Crazy Joe into a new suit of clothes for the occasion, and he stood by the side of little Sim on the step of the Gothic arch (the greater child of the tAvain) to laugh and chuckle a Avelcome, as sincere in its way as the homely greetings of the orphan's fosterers. It was a sine stalwart young man, of open but grave countenance, around whom Bess threw her motherly arms, Avhile Tom Hulme helped the bride to alight, and marshalled the Avay for the pair, who followed arm-in-arm into the house-place, where Simon, stiff with age and rheumatism, kept possession of the padded chair set apart for the sick or aged. In some Avay the knoAvledge that Mr. Clegg came as a master, and not as a servant, had preceded him. \" Eh, Jabez, lad,\" exclaimed Simon, tears of joy coursing down his cheeks, \" that aAv should ever live to see this day !

The occupation thus found for the mind and hand of Jabez at that particular epoch of his life was a blessing for which Ellen had need to be thankful in after years, if she had but known it. As it Avas, she did fancy he might have given her a little more of his time, and not have needed her suggestion to re-visit Taxal and the spot where he had Avooed her for another, and not for himself. Yet a very slight hint was sufficient, and, taking advantage of a clear, dry day, the tAvo re-trod the old path by the Goyt, which awoke reminiscences that could but be flattering to that self-love of which every human being has a share. Sitting doAvn as man and wife on the lightning-scathed tree trunk, which had never been removed, he remembered the confession Avrung from her agony on that very spot. His arm stole round her waist in the pitiful compassion it evoked. A neAV emotion stirred within his breast.

A consecutive message Avas beyond his grasp. All they could make out was, \"Back! Sharp! Quick!\" And, hastening on in alarm, they at length discerned Mr. Ashton at the gate, on the look-out. His pleasant nod Avas reassuring. \" My dear,\" he cried to Ellen, as they advanced, \" Dick has got his promotion at last ; Lieutenant Chadwick has been duly gazetted.

He handed the letter to his neAV nephew. \" Jabez, I think you had better carry it to your OAvn room for private perusal. I will communicate its contents to all Avhom it may concern besides.\" Jabez had deep feelings, though he was not demonstrative, and long before he had mastered its contents he was thankful for the delicacy which had spared him an open display of irrepressible emotion. The Avriter, who Avas stationed at Malta, after dAvelling on his OAvn promotion, and ansAvering sundry maternal questions relative to himself, went on to say \u2014 \" And so our Nell's going to be married.

Ben Travis ! What strange coincidence Avas this ? \" His father had been a Liverpool shipbroker, and Ben took to me because I Avas a Lancashire lad like himself, though he Avas old enough to be my father. He had been pressed, and as I was the youngest middy, and he the master of the forecastle, many a time had he told me the sad story of his life. His father had died without a will, and Ned, his eldest brother, had laid his clutches on everything but a hundred pounds or so, Avhich had been the mother's. Ben turned his back on Liverpool and his brother, and being smart Avith his pencil, took to that to get a living. He Avandered about to pick up bits of scenery, and at Crumpsall fell in Avith a widoAV and her daughter, both named Ann Crompton, and went to lodge with them. After a Avhile he married the lass, and thinking if he meant to earn a living for his wife and the child that was coming he'd best seek a large town, he removed to Manchester, and took an old cottage in Smedley Vale, Avhere he hoped to turn his talent to account.\" The paper rattled, and Jabez leaned against the Avindow frame, as much for support as light, as he read on with panting lips. '' He tried portrait-painting, but lacked a patron ; he turned his head to pattern-designing, but no one AA'ould employ a raw beginner. His money was dwindling, and a birth was near at hand.

Ned said her loss was killing him, and he wished to leave his boy in his brother's care before he died. Poor Ben Travis kissed his Avife, and went by coach to Liverpool. Before he could reach his brother's office in Castle Street, near the docks, he was pounced upon by a pressgang, dragged on board a ship in the Mersey, and never saw brother, or Avife, or home again. I have seen Ben's tears roll doAvn his Aveather-beaten cheeks many a time as he told this. He Avas one of the first sent down to the cock-pit at the battle of Trafalgar, and Avhen Admiral Nelson's glorious remains went home to be buried, Ben went likewise, to hospital, and I lost sight of him. When I Avas exchanged to the Excellent, Ben turned up again, hearty, but aged with grief. He had sought his dear ones, but a flood had swept through Smedley Vale in 1799, and left no trace of his home. A man at the dye-works remembered something about an old woman they called stiff-backed Nan being killed by the falling house in trying to save a baby ; but Ben could learn no more, and his own impression was that Avife, child, and mother-in-law had perished in the same catastrophe. He Avent to Liverpool. Death had swept off his brother ; executors swept off the son Ben, his namesake. He went back to sea, and I saw the brave Ben Travis drowned in trying to save a bumboat woman, who fell overboard off Spithead. \" And now, mother, you used to be a good hand at patchwork \u2014 piece my story and your story together, and see if Ellen's poor cradle-friend is not near of kin to your rich friend, Mr. Benjamin Travis, with quite as good a right to be called Mr. Travis too. \" I should have a rough sketch of the old sailor, drawn with a quid of 'bacca on the fly-leaf of his Prayer-book.

OHE January twilight had deepened into dusk, and from dusk to dark, before Jabez Avas sufficiently master of himself to descend into the light of the rooms beloAv. Whatever of surprise or satisfaction Richard Chadwick's letter had held for him, a wave of sorrow had passed over soul and countenance for the sad fate of the parents whom he had never known. As his footstep Avas heard overhead, Ellen flew to meet him at the foot of the staircase, and threw herself into his arms. \"My love! my own husband!\" Avas all she said, but such an intensity of devotion and sympathy was in the act and tone that he felt he had indeed a true heart beating with his as he held her close, and his lips touched her forehead as a seal to a new bond. It was but a single step to the parlour door, which opened on a room all aglow with light, and radiant faces. On Mr. Ashton's inspiriting, Simon's easy chair had been wheeled in from the house-place, there being no stately Mrs. Ashton at hand to demur at the innovation, or to whisper a syllable of class distinctions. And surely that was not \u2014 yes, it was \u2014 Ben Travis himself standing by the rheumatic old tanner, with both hands outstretched, to greet a new cousin in his long-time friend.

I suppose there will have to be a change of name, and Ellen there will be Mrs. Travis after all.\" This Avas but a playful sally on his part, but Ben Travis visibly winced, and quick-eyed Jabez saw it. \" No, sir,\" replied Jabez, calmly, Avith his hand on his Avife's shoulder, \" there will be no change. I bear the name of the kind friends Avho saA'ed my infant life ; fed, clothed, and kept me through evil report and good report, through pinching poverty, privation, and pain\" (he glanced towards Bess); \"as Jabez Clegg I Avas enrolled as a Blue-coat boy ; as Jabez Clegg I was apprenticed to you, sir ; as Jabez Clegg I married my Avife ; as Jabez Clegg I have been honoured Avith a place in your firm ; and Jabez Clegg shall go Avith me to the grave.

If I were occupied as you are from morning until night there might be less necessity. But \u2014 I say, Chapman the landlord here tells me you painted his sign.

That which was sending Travis abroad had kept Jabez close to business. He had not sought so much to dissipate thought as to circumvent it by substitution. If he had given his leisure to the cultivation of art, it had of late been art only as connected with manufacture and money-making. Even his honeymoon he was casting into the mill as grist. He Avas ever ready to take a hint. He turned his steps towards Carr with something like a sigh. \" Well, perhaps, I might as well give my afternoons to Ellen whilst we are here. I did not come to work, and the poor thing does need some compensation for the lack of a lover's ardour. God forbid that she should ever suspect that I married her out of pity, or that I should become a money-grubber. I Avonder if Travis thought I Avas likely to neglect her ? It is a thousand pities she should set her mind on me instead of him. And Avhy she should passes my comprehension. He has every advantage of face, figure, and fortune, to say nothing of his evident devotion. Ah ! women are strange creatures, and men are not much better. I fear I am very ungrateful not to reciprocate her attachment more fully. Why, here she is running down the avenue to meet me, as if I had been gone a month. I really ought to love her better than I do. But love can neither be forced nor crushed. Heigho ! \" \u25a0^|t \"^ yfc y_K yp; Back to Manchester they went, rather sooner than expected ; and then, though Jabez threw himself into business with a will, he bore in mind the parting Avords of Ben Travis. The contemplated amalgamation Avas effected, not without extra draughts on Jabez and his leisure. But as partner of a large firm, even though a junior, it was obvious he could not work as designer for calico-printers, or for any other than their OAvn house. Consequently, not being a man of pleasure, his"], [517, "Thb Manchester Man. 421 evenings hung rather heavily on his hands, especially as neither Ellen nor he cared for the card-parties Avhich formed the visiting staple. His very marriage had driven away his closest friend, and broken in upon plans and schemes which otherwise Avould have found sufficient occupation for his spare hours. Other friends, hoAvever, dropped in for an occasional chat, notably George Pilkington (to whom the wine trade had opened a road to fortune), with his reminiscences and jocularity, broke in on the monotony of married life, that monotony which is as much to be dreaded by young couples as is a first quarrel. Ellen kneAv it not, but Augusta's image often and often rose up betAveen husband and wife, and Avould not be driven back ; Avhilst Ellen's very caresses Avere a source of pain to him, so much he felt himself a debtor to her love. There Avas a void in his breast Avhich she could never Avholly fill ; he himself complained of a dearth of intellectual recreation, and Avhen Henry Liverseege suggested a return to painting, he fell back upon his advice. The fact is he needed to be alone, to have a place AA'here he could shut himself up with himself, Avhether to indulge in day-dreams or to discipline his soul, or to think out the ideas of art, trade, or social economy Avhich floated through his brain, and were dispersed by actual business or fireside chat ; such a sanctum as had been his so many years in Mosley Street ; but, self-conscious, he had shrunk from making the proposal, afraid to Avound his devoted Avife by shoAving a desire to isolate himself. The young artist's open remark Avas enough for Ellen. At once a small room, or rather closet, partitioned off from a large one, at the top of the house, was set apart for his use. He shelved one wall for books, set up an office-desk, carried thither easel, papers, and painting materials ; enclosed the fly-leaf of his father's Prayer-book within glass and a black frame, suspending it on the"], [518, "the Manchester man. 422 Avail before him as a sacred relic, and there, after Avarehouse hours, he Avas AA'ont to shut himself in, and almost forget that he was a married man. But this room acted as a safety-valve. Luckily, in Ellen's eyes, Jabez could do no Avrong ; he was gentleness itself in all his comportment towards her, and the love Avhich had sprung to life unsought, and lived so long without encouragement, asked but slight return to sustain it. It was treason for Mrs. Chadwick to hint that Jabez was \" unsocial,\" or gave them \" too little of his company.\" She Avas ever ready to resent it with the reply that \u2014 \" If he is not dull shut up there by himself, I am sure Ave three have no right to complain of dulness down here together;\" yet if Ave analysed her heart very closely there Avere longings and yearnings for his society known only to herself. It was judged advisable, for the further introduction and extension of Ashton, Chadwick, and Clegg's business, that one of the partners should travel occasionally as their commercial repre sentative ; and naturally this duty devolved upon the active junior, Avhose capacity for the undertaking revealed itself not only in heavy remittances and a full order-book, but in a paucity of bad debts. Of course he travelled with a horse and gig for the carriage of samples, and now and then he AA'ould take Ellen with him on a short journey, an indulgence which appeared to fill the cup of her delight. And altogether the marital yoke in a few months adjusted itself to their shoulders very naturally. It Avas during their absence on one of the earliest of these journeys that an event occurred Avhich set the indignant blood of Jabez on the boil, and showed there was a fire smouldering, not extinguished. The Aspinall home at Fallowfield was an ancient, many gabled grange, with muUioned Avindows, recessed window-seats, expansive two-leaved entrance arched above ; noble hall, with"], [519, "The Manchester Man. 423 trophies from the hunting-field ; grand staircase, with massive carved oak balusters, flights of broad Ioav steps, and Avide square landings ; long corridors, three or four rooms of magnificent proportions, and clusters of little ones grouped around unsuspected passages and stairs ; open fire-places recently enclosed, and double doors to the chief chambers. Antiquity had set its seal upon the place, and silled the panelled rooms with quaint or obsolete furniture and adornments, as each successive generation had left its quota. High-backed chairs, sofas of grotesque device with dim A\\'orsted-work cushions and covers, heavy draperies of silk or velvet, and tables with legs of all possible patterns. It had come to the former Mrs. Aspinall from her ancestors, and from her to her son on his marriage ; consequently this Avas the home proper of Laurence and his Avife, although they had a suite of rooms set apart for them at Ardwick, and Mr. Aspinall would fain have had his fascinating daughter-in-laAv abide there always, instead of making his house a mere convenience for visiting in tOAvn. Stabling and other outhouses Avere attached, the gardens Avere Avell laid out, there Avas a good quantity of grass land, all enclosed within a high wall, and it lay aAvay from the main road. Mr. Aspinall's carriage was a close one, for service as Avell as show. Air. Laurence, on his accession to his mother's property and his Avife's doAvry, added to other extravagances not a like carriage, but a new Tilbury, and astonished the crowd by driving tandem. Whitsuntide is the great annual festival of Manchester. It is the race Aveek, the time when the Sunday-school children dress in their best to Avalk in procession and have excursional treats into the country. In 1823 Whit-Sunday fell on the 18th of May, when the haAvthorn scented the air, and cherry-blossom snowed on the carriage which Mr. Aspinall sent for his daughter-"], [520, "The Manchester Man. 424 in-law, that she might witness from his drawing-room windoAvs the interesting spectacle on the Green, and preside over the hospitalities of his open house during the week. At that time, as noAV, Monday Avas the day set apart for the children of all the Established Church Schools to assemble at the Collegiate Church, sing anthems, and thence defile in long procession six abreast, attended by their respective clergy and teachers, until they reached the Green, Avhere the girls, in their white caps and frocks, Avere ranged Avithin the enclosure round the Pond, the boys forming a dark cordon around them, and the crowd a motley one beyond. And then from the multitudinous young throats poured forth anthems of praise in a volume of swelling harmony Avhich hushed to silence the listening birds above them. Augusta, not in robust health, lay on a couch by the windoAV and looked on, her father-in-law Avatching her and anticipating her wants with the homage of old-Avorld gallantry, for young Mrs. Aspinall Avas becoming an important person in his eyes. Nor was Laurence much less attentive. He had been on his best behaviour for some time, and would scarcely let the Avind of heaven blow too roughly upon her. At that period Manchester races were held on Kersal Moor, an extensive tract of land generously set apart for the purpose by the owner, Miss Byrom. \" The glass of fashion and the mould of form,\" was the handsome man Avho patted Augusta's shoulders and stooped doAvn to kiss her on Wednesday, the first race day ; but it Avas with something more than a shade of anxiety she saw him draw on his buckskin gloves, take the long reins, and mount his high Tilbury, with Bob beside him, and dash round the loAver end of the Green at a canter. Evening came to verify her fears. Back from Kersal Moor came the tandem and the tandem's master, but the biped was"], [521, "Thb Manchester Man. 425 ebrius. He was in that stage of self-satisfied elation which a contradictory word Avould change to fierceness, and the whim of the hour Avas to drive his wife to Fallowfield, and show her how dexterous a whip he Avas, and that not Ductoav could manage a tandem better than he. It was in vain she or his father pleaded her delicate health, the height of the vehicle, the shaking she Avould sustain ; he laughed at her fears, then fiercely insisted, and not daring to disobey, she Avas hoisted to her perilous seat. In much alarm, Mr. Aspinall mounted Bob on a saddle horse to follow. The roads were dotted Avith vehicles and people, the latter shouting and singing, or muttering tipsy oaths, as the fortune of the day inclined them. Laurence proved his dexterity in guiding his far-off leader through all intricacies, but so close did Avheel often come to Avheel that Augusta's heart seemed to leap into her throat, and her teeth chattered, although it was May. After they turned off from the Stockport Road at Longsight, they \" spun along at a rattling pace,\" as he said ; but she had to hold by the rail to keep her seat, notAvithstanding Avhich, at the sharp angle by Birch Fold, the vehicle gave a lurch which almost pitched her off. At their own gate there was an abrupt stoppage for opening, their return being unexpected. Then the foremost horse refused to obey the rein and canter up the drive. Laurence plied his Avhip, Avhich did not mend the matter, and but that Bob and the gardener were there to soothe the animals, and lead them to the house, worse might have followed. As it was, Mrs. Laurence Aspinall was half-dead with fear and the shaking. She was lifted doAvn and carried, almost insensible, into the house. Cicily and one of the maids got her to bed, whilst Aspinall himself, calling groom and gardener from the stables into the drawing-room, sat down to have a drinking bout with them."], [522, "426 The Manchester Man. Presently Cicily put a Avhite face in at the door, and beckoned forth Bob, Avhom no drink seemed to affect, and sent him off as fast as four legs could carry him, to bring back a doctor, and acquaint Mr. Aspinall and the Ashtons that his young mistress was very ill. In less time than might have been expected, Mr. Aspinall's carriage brought to the Grange that gentleman, Mrs. Ashton, and Mr. Windsor, a young Quaker practitioner from Piccadilly. A competent nurse from the Infirmary Avas on the box. There was no doubt she Avas in a critical state, but the immediate danger Avas Avarded off; and though Augusta Avas not able to leave her room in the interim, the scent of June's roses came in at the open windows before her baby Avas born, Avhen penitent Laurence went into raptures oA'er Avife and son. For two or three days he hovered about the house, nervously anxious lest any sound should disturb the young mother. He saw that every domestic Avas shod Avith list, stopped the great hall clock, and had the rolled-up carpets laid doAvn on the polished oaken stairs. Four days sufficed. On the fifth he rode off to toAvn on Black Ralph on a pretence of business ; but very little did Cannon Street see of Mr. Laurence that day. With every acquaintance he met Avas a glass to be drunk, \"to Avet the child's head.\" At the Scramble Club, where he dined, he paid for two or three bottles of Avine, also \" to wet the child's head,\" according to the practice of the club. Riding home, he stopped at the \" George and Dragon,\" Ardwick Green, and Avent through the same process. There some one remarked that he Avas too drunk to stand, much less ride home, Avhen he swore with an oath that he would show them hoAv he could ride ; he and Hiack Ralph were equal to anything. And then, amid roars of derisi\\'e laughter, he flung"], [523, "the Manchester man 427 out another oath, and laid a Avager which Avas regarded merely as the boasting of drunken braggadocio. He had kissed his Avife's pale lips on leaving in the morning, and she faintly implored him to be home early \u2014 she did not dare add, \" and sober.\" Towards nightfall she began to listen for his return. Hour after hour went by, and at one in the morning she heard the great gates and the door thrown open for their impatient master by the watching servants, and the strong steed come tearing up the gravel \u2014 ay, and on up the broad, flat steps, clattering through the great oaken hall, and, urged Avith Avhip and spur, and a madman's voice, mount the freshly-carpeted stairs, cross the landing at a stride, and driving back the affrighted nurse, enter that sick chamber where, with her baby at her side, lay the fair young wife, gasping and shrinking Avith terror, and there stand Avith quivering flanks and panting nostrils, as the reckless rider on his back cried in exultation \u2014 \"By G\u2014 d, I've done it!\" He had done it.

Not until long afterwards was it known that Sarah Mostyn Avas the last Avoman to have entered that house, and on such a footing. One month, two months wore out before Augusta rallied, and Mr. Windsor, whose medical creed was to \"let nature take its course,\" pronounced her out of danger, and fit for the removal contemplated by her friends, and resisted by Laurence. Double doors, however, could not exclude outer sounds, and so long as she shrank and shuddered at every crunch on the gravel, every echo of his raised voice, recovery was retarded. So the elder Mr. Aspinall, exasperated Avith his son, and most solicitous for the welfare of his son's charming wife, added his dictum to that of the doctor, offered his own carriage for her conveyance, and threatened to disinherit Laurence if he interfered. Once in her childhood's home she amended rapidly, but Avith increasing strength came maternal yearnings for her infant, still in charge of the wet-nurse at FalloAvfield. A hackney-coach Avas sent to bring Sarah Mostyn with the child to its mother ; but not a step would the nurse budge. She had no orders from her master, and the master paid her Avages, and she \"shouldna tak' orders from annybody else.\" Messages were sent, and notes were written to Laurence, which he tore to shreds ; but he kept aAvay from his wife, and kept back the child. At length she pined so much for her \" dear babe,\" that Mr. Ashton and Jabez together sought Laurence out in one of his haunts (a tavern near Cockpit Hill), to prevail on him to let Augusta have her boy with her. \" Mrs. Aspinall herself deserted her child,\" he replied, all the more haughtily, seeing that Jabez was Mr. Ashton's seconder. \" When Mrs. Aspinall thinks fit to return home to her maternal and wifely"], [526, "430 the Manchester man. duties, she will find the nursery door open, and her son in trustAVorthy care.

Only a reckless madman or a ruffian Avould have forced a horse into a wife's sick-chamber, to drive her delirious with terror!\" \"And pray, sir,\" haughtily responded the other, \"hoAv long has Mrs. Aspinall made you her confidant?\" \" I have not the honour of Mrs. Aspinall's confidence,\" ansAvered Jabez sturdily, looking him full in the face ; \" such facts are trumpet-tongued.\" \"Just so,\" put in Mr. Ashton, drawing his arm through that of his junior partner. \"And the fact that Augusta shrinks at your name has spoken so loudly to us that if ever she sits on your hearth again it won't be Avith my consent. Come aAvay, Clegg.\" After this declaration, Aspinall changed his tactics. He Avrote to his Avife, requesting her return ; then entreating it ; and finally went in person to beseech her to \" come back,\" vowing to \" atone for the past with the devotion of a life.\" The young mother yearned for her babe, the tender-hearted Avife could not resist the appeal of the husband whom, Avith all his faults, she yet loved ; and, regardless of the previsions of her mother, or the entreaties of her father, she alloAved him to drive her home again to the Grange. Her first thought was the nursery. There she found, in addition to her own boy, draAving its sustenance from the nurse's"], [527, "The Manchester Man. 431 breast, a Avell-dressed child, some two years old, playing with a Avooden milkmaid rattle on the rug. Something in the child's face and auburn curls made her ask, \" Sarah, whose child is that ? \" \" Mine. Whose should it be ? \" was the pert ansAver ; and the boldness of the Avoman's manner checked further inquiry. But Augusta's heart had received a shock Avhich shook the pedestal on Avhich her idol sat enthroned. For a short space Laurence kept terms with his Avife, and before her father or strangers he was her most devoted slave, but she underwent a species of sIoav torture in secret. She soon found that Sarah Mostyn was mistress of the house as well as of the nursery, and that Sarah Mostyn's child was of as much importance as her own baby-boy. Then Laurence filled the Grange with his riotous associates, and compelled his Avife to do the honours of his table, though their oaths and conversation OA'erpowered her Avith disgust. And if one, flushed Avith Avine, or more bold than the rest, paid her a compliment, or looked too Avarm an admiration, he Avas sure to find his way to her side Avith his common undertone threat \u2014 \"D n you, madam, you shall smart for this!\" \u2014 a threat always accompanied with sly pinches, Avhich left their marks beneath her sleeves.

But save on an occasional family gathering, she saAV few of her OAvn sex at FalloAvfield. And her position in her OAvn home Avas rendered intolerable by the continued presence of Sarah Mostyn, who, at first familiar, then impertinent, had become at last openly defiant. It was not until all efforts to keep the nurse in her proper place had failed, that Augusta appealed to Laurence to discharge her, the Avoman having refused to take a dismissal from anyone but her master. \"Tchut!\" said he, \"I'll soon settle that business!\" and forthwith stalked to the nursery, Avhence his voice Avas heard in loud command ; but the result was not the Avoman's removal, only a temporary submission, to be followed by fresh rebellion, and the confirmation of Augusta's worst suspicions. How often did the aggrieved wife then recall her thoughtless declaration to her mother, that her \" husband's heart must hold her and her only\" not even business to share in its possession ! And hoAv thankful she Avould have been to have had no rival then but business ! She was finding the bed she had made for herself a Avoefully hard one ; but she did not succumb readily, she had high spirits and a buoyant nature, and would hardly admit to herself how much she suffered or how great a mistake she had made. But Cicily, that most faithful of faithful followers, cognisant of her mistress's wrongs long before her mistress, paid Sarah Mostyn off in her own coin on various occasions, and took care that through one means or other the Ashtons should know what a life their darling led. Amongst his other little peculiarities Mr. Laurence Avas an epicure, and one of his favourite tit-bits was that spongy lining of a goose's frame knoAvn as the soul. It chanced at a family dinner,"], [529, "The Manchester Man. 433 rather more than a year after Augusta's return home, that a fine stubble goose formed part of the bill of fare, and Cicily, who had long OAved him a grudge for his heartless treatment of her young mistress, determined to pay him off, and expose him before the whole company. A good caterer for a dainty palate, Cicily knew her poAver and privileges, but in this case she overshot the mark. One of the accomplishments of that generation was dexterous carving, and Laurence prided himself on being able to dismember a large fowl Avithout once shifting his fork. The goose Avas set before himself, and duly helped, but, lo ! when his knife would fain have extracted his faA'Ourite morsel it scraped bare bones. The flat bell-rope was pulled violently. Cicily Avas summoned, and Cicily, in clean linen cap and apron, stood in the doorway curtseying respectfully. \"What have you done with the soul of this goose?\" he demanded, in a tone of suppressed passion. Cicily came a step or two forward with an aspect of marvellous innocence. \" Eh, sir, it's not a goose, it's a gonder, and gonders have no son Is.\" Scarcely an individual present but took the covert innuendo, and glances were exchanged across the board ; but the look he shot at the Avoman as, incapable of speech, he waved her to retire, Avas one never to be forgotten, so much demoniac wrath Avas concentrated therein. From the time Avhen Jabez Avas acknowledged on 'Change as a Manchester man, Avas admitted into Manchester \" society,\" and had absolutely become a member of the same family as his son, Mr. Aspinall punctiliously invited him Avith his Avife; and Laurence, Avith widely different feelings, folloAved suit. It was not until after the noble exploit to which Augusta so nearly fell a sacrifice that Mr. Clegg could be induced so far to listen to Ellen's desire for conciliation, \" now that they were all FF"], [530, "the Manchester Man. 434 of one family,\" as to accept one of these invitations. After that event he was of Mrs. Ashton's mind that \"as offenders never pardon,\" Augusta needed a friend to Avatch over her. So he left his books, and his brushes, and his schemes for the class amongst Avhom he had been reared, and (believing his growing affection for his Avife, and the babe she had borne him, a sufficient guarantee to his own heart for his own good faith) when the Aspinalls next invited, he accepted. As previously stated, Augusta had not dropped into tame submission all at once ; her old Avilfulness Avould have Avay at times, and the light shafts of her satire were frequently aimed with effect against her recalcitrant lord. More than once Jabez had averted disastrous consequences by checking her vivacity ere it Avent too far. But never had he been so thankful for his self appointed guardianship as on the night Avhen Cicily thought to pay back her darling's Avrongs. To his surprise and pleasure, Ben Travis, just returned from the Continent, Avas of the party. He had not yet called on the family in Oldham Street, and Jabez never asked him wherefore The cousins had much to talk over, and whilst Laurence Aspinall Avas pouring wine on his Avrath, they discussed a project in which Jabez took an interested part, and which eventuated the following year in the Manchester Mechanics' Institution. But through all their discussion Jabez never once lost sight of Laurence, and from his excessively polite manner to her augured ill for Augusta Avhen the restraining presence of friends Avas removed. He communicated his fears to Travis, and Avhen the good-byes were said, and the various conveyances rolled out betAveen the great gates, a fee to Luke the gardener, who Avas also gatekeeper, kept them open.

There was a flagged footway round the building, and from the windows of dining and drawing rooms light was still streaming. The last owner had lowered the middle windoAv of the draAving-room as a door of access to the lawn. As if by accident the curtains had been dragged a little aside in each apartment, and now there were Avatchers at the apertures. The elder Mr. Aspinall had made an excuse and retired to bed early. Augusta, with a shawl wrapped round her, sat weeping on a sofa in the drawing-room, afraid to go to bed. High words had evidently passed whilst those outside had made their arrangements at the gate. Presently, into the dining-room sauntered Laurence, with his arm round the shoulders of Sarah Mostyn, the shameless nurse. They sat doAvn to the supper-table ; he poured out wine into a goblet, and they drank from the same glass ; he fed her with delicacies, and kissed and caressed her with an assured familiarity Avhich told it was no new experience. Long they lingered drinking and dallying, and the watchers might have thought no danger need be apprehended. Suddenly a word of the woman's, like a match to petroleum, set the whole man ablaze. He rushed from the room Avith a loud oath, the woman after him, apparently in alarm. The movement her friends made outside in gaining the other window caused Augusta to raise her beautiful head, and at that moment her husband stood before her, brandishing his cavalry sabre, and with his eyeballs glaring, fiercely vociferating, \" I'll teach you, madam, to set my servants to insult me!\" he made a fearful slash at her."], [534, "436 The Manchester Man.

Poor Mr. Ashton's care was his stricken child, Avhose Avhite shoulders, bathed in blood, Avere washed by a father's tears. Thankful then was Jabez to have been at hand, and on the alert, with so powerful an ally as Travis ; thankful to have saved Augusta's life at any sacrifice of personal feeling ; and only himself could tell Avhat his presence under that roof cost him. Even Laurence had no inkling of it ; the marriage of Jabez had closed his jealous eyes.

He fought, struggled, vociferated, threatened, and foamed at the mouth ; and Mr. Aspinall, coming thither in his dressing-gOAvn, aroused by the uproar, could barely master his indignation and disgust as he ordered the men-servants, crowding in half-dressed, to \" help to bind that murderous maniac down ! \" It was well, too, that Mrs. Ashton and Ellen were close at hand, and a vehicle ready to despatch for a surgeon, for Augusta needed all their care.

To make way for its expansion more Avarehouse room was required. The Ashtons, not Avithout a sigh for old association, relinquished their house, and removed to another close at hand in George Street, little less commodious, hoAvever much Kezia might grumble at it. This was when Ben Travis, lacking employment for time, mind, and money, offered them to the growing establishment, and his influence as \"Co.\" was accepted. This combination of capital and energy, as Jabez had foreseen, Avorked wonders for them commercially, enabling them to tide over the trade distress of 1826 with security and advantage. Long before then Jabez had offered to pay Mrs. Clowes her loan, with interest ; but she told him she Avas going to render up her account where, not the coin she had, but that which she had given away, Avould be put to her credit ; and so, as at first proposed, she made it over to her little godson, Joshua Clegg, before she Avas gathered to the great garner. But the universal moAver reaped a heavier harvest in 1828, when he swept his keen scythe over the bed of the river. In 1822 Mr. Ashton (one of the first promoters of the Chamber of Commerce), notAvithstanding his advancing years, took an active part in the formation of a NeAV Quay Company, for the better navigation of the river Irwell. The company Avas established, quays Avere constructed, warehouses erected, boats built, traffic was extended, and the town generally benefited. In the February of 1828, the axe, the adze, and the hammer made a busy noise in the boat-building yard of the company, and sail-makers were active Avith their needles ; for a flat or barge, destined to convey cargoes of merchandise to and from Liverpool, was to be ready for the launch on the 26th, a day destined to send a thrill of horror tingling through the veins of Manchester, so sad was the catastrophe it closed upon."], [538, "The Manchester Man, 440 The launch of the Emma Avas an event in the annals of the company, and of the tOAvn ; consequently a large number of spectators assembled, a goodly proportion being admitted to the yard to take part in the ceremony, and to go Avith the flat on her trial trip under Captain Gaudy. Mrs. Ashton, saying, \" that Avhen the cat's aAvay the mice will play,\" had decided on remaining at home to Avatch the mice, but Mr. Ashton compensated himself by taking Ellen and her two elder boys, leaving baby with its grandma ; Jabez, detained by business in the counting-house, promising to overtake them before they were on board.

But that he should rescue strangers, and Jabez save his wife, and that through trans- fusion the blood of Jabez should course through Au- gusta's veins, formed a com- bination of mischances beyond parallel, and the honey was changed to gall. Nay, he was EMPTIES. graceless enough to exclaim, in the first burst of his jealous rage, \" I would rather she had died outright than have that fellow triumph in her restoration through his means. D him!\" And yet there were times when in his uxorious fondness he wholly persuaded himself, and half persuaded her, that his very extravagances arose from excess of love!"], [550, "448 The Manchester Man. His fancied wrongs culminated when first the will of his father, and after a brief period that of Augusta's father, Avere read and proved. The former set forth that, disgusted Avith the ungentleman-like excesses of his son, and convinced that his course of lavish extravagance would end in penury, he had determined to settle on his son's wife, Augusta Aspinall, for her sole use and benefit, the house and premises on Ardwick Green, Avith all therein contained, together with a sufficient sum in the funds to maintain a befitting state ; in the event of her decease, the reversion to pass to any child or children she had or might hereafter bear to his son Laurence. To him he left the residue of his means, and the old business in Cannon Street, with a charge to apply himself to merchandise. The latter will, though equally stringent, Avas a much more prolix affair. After a number of legacies, of which Jabez came in for one, Mr. Ashton bequeathed to his wife all other properties Avhatsoever he died possessed of, together Avith half his share in the firm of Ashton, ChadAvick, Clegg, and Co. ; the other half to his beloved daughter, limiting the annual sum she was to draAv from the firm, and which was in nowise to pass into the hands of her depraved husband ; and Jabez Clegg and Benjamin Travis Avere appointed executors for the due performance of its provisions. Imagine the excitement and jealous fury of Laurence Aspinall on thus being set aside even by his own father and superseded by his wife ; and as if that Avere not sufficient degradation, to have Jabez Clegg, Avhose charity-school face yet bore the impress of his foot, set as his wife's executor, to dole out what he called a \"pittance\" where he had anticipated a fortune! It so happened that the early duties of his executorship called Jabez once or twice unexpectedly to FalloAvsield, and that on each occasion the master of the mansion Avas from home."], [551, "The Manchester Man. 449 It might be that the river had Avashed the roses from Augusta's cheeks so effectually that her complexion had neA'er regained its tone ; or it might be that her skin looked Avhite in contrast Avith the blackness of her bombazine and crape ; certain it was that Jabez was struck Avith the pallor of her countenance, and his inquiry, \" Are you not Avell, Mrs. Aspinall ?\" was tinctured Avith alarm. As a light flush tinged her cheek, then faded aAvay again, and she received him with a timid indecision very unlike her former girlish freedom, a sense of her almost supernal loveliness brought something of the old ache into his heart, and out of respect for himself and her, he hurried over his business, and having obtained the signatures for Avhich he came, mounted his horse and rode back to town, haunted by look, and voice, and manner. Yet in the integrity of his own heart he had no conception that her embarrassment was the result of fear \u2014 fear of the interpretation her jealous madman of a husband would put on so umvonted a visit. He thought he saw a smile of malice in the corners of the mouth of the bold Avoman Avho met him in the hall, and nodded to him so freely as he passed her on his Avay out ; but no prescient spirit whispered in his ear that his twenty minutes' visit on absolute business Avould furnish envy and jealousy with a pretext for foul-mouthed slander, for coarse vituperation, for the use of a whip, and for calumnious accusations Avhich cut deeper than its lash. Cicily, Avho intervened to save her mistress, might have com'eyed some inkling of this to Mrs. Ashton, but Augusta absolutely forbade her sympathetic servant's interference. \" You would do no good, Cicily,\" she said ; \" the evil is beyond earthly remedy ; you would only distress my dear mother to no purpose, and she has suffered too much on my account already. It cannot last for ever!\" GG"], [552, "450 The Manchester man. On the next occasion Jabez was accompanied by his joint executor, but eA-en that fact did not save Augusta from her husband's wrath, and his vile aspersions went far to drive out the last lingering sentiment of affection or regard she had for him. But she clung to her child, and that bound her to her home and him whom in an evil hour she had chosen ; though tears fell bitterly on Willie's curly head, when he, like his father, gave her back blows for kisses. And if at times her conscience smote her for her haughty repulse of Jabez by the stair-foot AvindoAv at Carr Cottage, Avhat Avonder ? Had not Laurence himself scored his rejected rival's name on her heart with his braces and whip-lash ? She shut the obtrusive memory out Avith a shudder, and, dropping on her knees, prayed earnestly for strength to bear and to forbear. Yet much of the cruelty of Laurence at this time arose from another source than causeless jealousy. He had been living far beyond his private means, and Avas greatly involved. He had calculated on laying his hand on a good round sum, and Avas disappointed. In order, hoAvever, to raise the needful, he sold his father's old-established concern to their head clerk, far beloAv its value. On the Fallowfield estate his friend Barret held a mortgage, and, had it been possible, he would similarly have disposed of Augusta's possessions. Here, hoAvever, he AA'as doubly baffled, and he turned on her as the primary cause. The old law which preserved the Avoman's absolute right over properties legally settled upon herself, by strange anomaly did not secure to her one guinea of the coin those properties produced. Well did Jabez Avatch over Augusta's interest, but his heart ached as he saAV her sad countenance, and the greedy triumphant eyes of ever-present Laurence Avhen her dividends Avere paid in. For, before his very face, Laurence laid his hand upon the money, to squander it as he had squandered his OAvn on Sarah"], [553, "The Manchester man. 451 Mostyn and other dissolute companions, leaving his Avife without so much as would purchase a pocket-handkerchief. Then, lest she should make her Avrongs knoAvn, he kept her a close prisoner at Fallowfield, and, for all the pleasure she had of her Ardwick mansion, she might as well have been Avithout it. No wonder if each fresh act of personal violence snapped some bond between them, until the only one link to bind her to life and her husband was her boy Willie ; whilst the only human trait of Laurence was his fondness for his son, whom he was rapidly ruining Avith false indulgence, as he himself had been ruined. It Avas customary, Avhen the hay-making season came round, for Laurence to gather such friends as his wife or he retained \u2014 the married Avith their children \u2014 for a frolic in the hayfields, and the bringing home the last waggon-load in triumph to crown or inaugurate a feast. On these occasions he had the grace, or the diplomacy, to keep Sarah Mostyn in the background, though she flaunted boldly enough about the house in the presence of his wife, and her child mingled with the children. The harvest-home of 1831 Avas attended Avith the customary festivities, Willie, a rough playmate, was half smothering Nelly Clegg in the hay, or chasing the Walmsleys amongst the haycocks, until the last load Avas ready, and then the boy insisted that he and his companions should be mounted atop. Shouts and cheers announced their coming to the party in the draAving-room ; they came crowding to the Avindows, and, the glass-door being open, one or two sauntered out on to the flagged Avalk. Merrily they came along the gravelled drive, under the hot sun, dreaming of no danger, Willie clapping his hands and calling, \"Look at us papa,\" when, right in front of the drawing-room window, the pin"], [554, "452 The Manchester man. Avhich held the body of the cart down, by some means became displaced, the cart tilted up, and hay and children Avere sent flying. Beyond a few bruises, none of the children were injured but one ; they had fallen amongst hay, or on the spongy laAvn ; but Willie, the one jewel in the Aspinall casket, pitched AA'ith his head on the flagged pavement, and Avas killed on the spot. Draw Ave the curtain over consternation and bereavement, and pass on to results. If a change came over Laurence, it was not for the better. He drank incessantly, became alternately moody and defiant, and added a coping-stone to his offences by placing Sarah Mostyn at his table by the side of his Avife, and boldly avoAving that her child Avas his child also. Then all the woman rose Avithin Augusta, so long cowed and dispirited. She left the table, and, the insult being repeated, again retired in indignation. Of the servants none had pitied her so much as Cicily, but for Avhom communication with her friends had been cut off. Often had the former waxed savage over indignities she could neither check nor prevent ; but in many little Avays the faithful domestic Avas enabled to ameliorate the condition of her mistress. Now that Mrs. Aspinall \u2014 more lovely in her sad womanhood than in her brilliant girlhood \u2014 Avas virtually supplanted, a prisoner under torture in her husband's house, Avith no tie of motherhood to bind her there, her old nurse, as the mouthpiece of Mrs. Ashton and her aunt Chadwick, had urged upon her once more the necessity for legal separation, and she no longer turned a deaf ear.

Mr. Clegg will not object to the cost, if you can only be made Mrs. Clegg by Act of Parliament.\" It Avas a cruel and uncalled-for sneer, and Travis, firing up, resented it for his friend, Avho appeared dumbfounded by the suggestion. \" If she had been Mrs. Clegg, sir, instead of Mrs. Aspinall, there would have been no necessity now for the interference of friends for her protection ! \" \" Of course not,\" sneered Aspinall. \" Mr. Clegg is the Avhite hen that never lays aAvay ; and now, having favoured you with one of Mrs. Ashton's pithy proverbs, perhaps, gentlemen, you will favour me by taking your departure ; this house and this lady are alike my property.\" The value he set upon the latter article of property Avas testified by an immediate application of a horsewhip, so savagely applied that even Bob, and Luke the gardener, drawn thither by Augusta's screams, wrenched the Avhip from him, and covered her escape, the latter declaring he Avould \" no longer stay an' witness sich wark.\" To this man, who was also gatekeeper, Cicily crept at nightfall, and offered him a goodly sum down, out of her own savings, promising a much larger one from Mrs. Aspinall, Avith the offer of a new situation at ArdAvick, if he would only suffer her ill-used mistress to \" get clear o' that brute's violence.\" The man, to his credit be it told, refused the money, but opened the gate; and, Avhen Laurence Avakened from his sodden sleep at noon the next day, wife, cook, and gardener Avere missing.

Without Avaiting for even the sIioav of a breakfast, Augusta hurried like a frightened bird to her mother's nest in George Street, where alone she felt secure. Jabez and Travis Avere summoned, and when Aspinall, recovering from his stupor, sought his human property at Ardwick, he found the trustee under his father's will \u2014 a Mr. Lillie \u2014 holding the place for Augusta in right of his trust. And in George Street he Avas refused admission, Mrs. Ashton justifying her daughter's flight Avith \"self-preservation is the first law of nature. A good Jack makes a good Jill. It is the last straw breaks the camel's back. If you sow the wind, you must reap the Avhirlwind. He Avho beats his friend makes an enemy.\" He threatened, and she answered \u2014 \" Threatened folk live long. You had best, Mr. Aspinall, keep your breath to cool your porridge. Augusta's friends will defend her from her only enemy. Pending separation you see her no more.\" He never saAV her more. The deed of separation Avas sealed but never signed. With Augusta, all good angels seemed to have floAvn from Fallowfield. In his demoniac passion, he strove to blacken her character, to find himself met Avith laughter \u2014 his own life had been so chaste! Whilst, as if to refute him, Avhen she took refuge Avith her mother, Jabez deemed it a point of honour to retreat. Accordingly he took up his temporary abode Avith Travis, in delicacy towards her, and as a check upon himself. No act, or thought, or word of his must give an evil tongue a chance to foul that spotless woman Avith its slime. In the midst of all this, Aspinall's embarrassments increased. Creditors pressed ; writs showered in upon him ; Barret foreclosed,"], [557, "The Manchester Man. 455 and men were put in possession of the Grange. He flew to his old remedy, and it drove him mad. Lancaster Gaol for debtors loomed upon him. From his chamber window he beheld a sheriff's officer approach with a warrant. His cavalry-pistols were in his dressing-room. A sharp report rang through the house. Laurence Aspinall, in the prime of life, delirious Avith drink, driven to desperation by his own profligate excess, set a blood-red seal on the deed of separation. Ten years had passed from the partnership of Ashton, Chadwick, and Clegg \u2014 years in Avhich money Avell employed had multiplied itself. Jabez Avas a rich man \u2014 a man of influence in the town ; no longer the amateur artist, but the patron of art, as Avell Henry Liverseege and others could have told. As he had been one of the first promoters and directors of the Manchester Mechanics' Institution, so was he now the supporter of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Art ; and seeing farther than Mr. Ashton, Avho, as a member of the New Quay Navigation Company, had opposed the Act for a railway between Manchester and Liverpool, he threAV his energy into the project, and helped to carry it out, his cousin Travis Avorking Avith him. His Avidowerhood had cast a gloom over him for a time, but he left himself small leisure for morbid reflection, and that Avas cheered by the prattle of his little Nelly. Then came the crash at Fallowfield, and when darkness set upon Aspinall and his deeds, light broke upon the path of Jabez Clegg\u2014 at first a mere ray, but he worked the more cheerfully in its light. It was not hope for himself; it was merely a joyful consciousness that there Avas hope and calm in the sky over the head of their fluttering and wounded dove, and that Augusta could now rest in peace with her mother in the house at Ardwick, with no dread of a brutal husband bursting on them unawares."], [558, "456 Thb Manchester Man. He came and Avent as friend and executor, but it Avas long before it flashed across his comprehension that the fearful ordeal through Avhich Augusta had passed but brought his old master's daughter closer to him ; or that the prayer old Simon had taught was being answered to the full. That Avhich Avas \"above rubies\" had blessed his life, and kept his human heart warm whilst his \"coast had enlarged;\" he had been kept from the evil of a wilful and capricious Avife; and at last when he had resigned all prospect of setting the purified pearl as a star on his own breast, it dropped into his hand, unsought, unsolicited. He had schooled his heart, avo know. He had married from a sense of duty and grateful compassion. He Avas a faithful husband to a true Avife, and when he lost her he mourned her as a valued friend. But though all the early love of his being had been kept alive and in a ferment by the sufferings of Augusta, as an honourable man he suffered no Avord or look to betray more than a friend's sympathy. And still he kept as strong a guard over himself, though the tragic end of Laurence had set her free once more. The last fatal act struck a sensitive chord in Augusta's nature. There was no exultation at release. For a time she lost sight of his profligacy and cruelty, and accused herself of having hastened the catastrophe by leaving him to his own unbridled will and the temptress by his side. She Avept for the handsome lover Avho had captiA'ated her young fancy ; she mourned for the besotted soul gone to its account with all its imperfections rampant. \" Let her alone,\" said Mrs. Ashton to her sister ; \" the sharpest shower Avears itself out soonest ; she will come to her senses long before her crape is Avorn out.\" Mrs. Ashton Avas a true prophetess.

(Kitty had been laid under the mould whilst Augusta was yet a bride.) Almost two years had elapsed. Suitors in plenty had been attracted by the wealthy young widow's many charms, her old admirer, Mr. Marsland, among the rest, yet Mrs. Aspinall showed no disposition to change her state ; and the one man Avho had loved her longest and best Avas not of the number at her feet. He scorned to importune iioav in his widowerhood for the love withheld when they Avere both young. He counted age by events, not years. It was for Augusta now, she who had been taught by her very husband's taunts and sneers to think upon the true man she had set aside, to think of him daily and hourly with rapidly strengthening attachment, and think of him as one who had dropped her from the book of his life for ever. Her whole thought was how could she become Avorthy the love of such a man ; yet every day and hour the fear pressed heavily upon her that the quiet virtues of Ellen had driven her out of his heart altogether.

He indulged the boy's craving for books and pencils, first implanted by himself, and in Avhich he saw the daAvn of his future career. That Avhich in his own case had been repressed and subordinated to trade and money-making, should not be so checked in that boy ; and old Simon, to whom the lad appeared a marvel, never ceased to pride himself on his forecast in pronouncing Jabez a \" Godsend.\" It Avas during the second summer of her Avidowhood, Avhen Augusta accompanied her mother (not a whit the less stately than of yore) to Carr Cottage for the first time since her attempted elopement, that the feeling of all she had cast from her, and all that she had brought upon herself, all that might have been, and iioav never Avould be, pressed heaviest upon her. She had gone thoughtfully over the old ground, had trod the nettle-groAvn Lovers' Walk, and sat down on the open window- ledge at the stairfoot as once before, and Avept tears of penitent bitterness. How long she sat there she could not tell ; she Avas weeping for a life lost and a love rejected.

TN the foregoing story of the ''Manchester Man,\" I have in a great measure -*- dealt with history, recorded and unrecorded, with absolute people, events, and places. I have not thought it advisable to break the narrative with cumbrous foot-notes calculated to disturb the general reader; but I consider an elucidating Appendix due alike to myself and to all those who, in perusing a work of this kind, care to dis criminate fact from fiction. Little of the Manchester I have depicted remains intact, a whirlwind of improvement (!) has swept over the town, but old inhabitants will, I think, recognise the faithfulness of my descriptions, as they will remember many of the persons who come and go incidentally throughout. Chap. I.\u2014 After writing this chapter, I learned that a cradled infant was washed down the Irwell from the Broughton, not the Smedley and Irk side, in the flood of 1837. I was familiar with the incident I relate when I was quite a child myself, and I am now fifty-four. The two cases are therefore distinct, yet equally facts. In 1771, during the floods which swept away Tyne Bridge, Newcastle, a vessel took up at sea a cradle in which was a child alive and well. Chap. III. \u2014 The Rev. Joshua Brookes comes into my pages naturally\u2014 no story of Manchester life at the commencement of this century would be complete without him. I have endeavoured to do justice to a little-understood man. Many of his eccentricities are on record. At my own baptism and my mother's churching, occurred the scene which I have endeavoured to reproduce; the delicate lady pushed and pulled about was a stranger to my mother and sponsors. A characteristic anecdote, which I have not met with in print, may not be out of place here. A printer, of Republican tendencies, named Cowdroy, took his son to the font, and on the child's name being required, answered \" Citizen 1 \"\u2014\" Citizen ?\" growled Joshua, \" that's no name. I shall not give the child a name like that ! \" \" I've a right to call my child what name I please, and I dare you to baptise him otherwise,\" boldly asserted Mr. Cowdroy. \" Oh, you may call him Beelzebub if you like,\" testily responded the chaplain, and Citizen the boy was accordingly baptized; and the large signboard of C.

His daughters, anxious for his safety, looking out for his return home from the warehouse, saw from their open window more than I describe ; for one thing \u2014 a woman passed with her breast cut off ; the two vaunting officers who reared their steeds against the house with threats were a cousin and a fianc'e ; the man who was shot down in Ancoats Lane, whilst bidding his girls to retire, was, I believe, my grandfather's tenant. The female sabred on the hustings was a Mrs. Fildes when I knew her. Her son, Henry Hunt Fildes, was in my father's employ ; and his nephew is now an artist not altogether unknown to the world. From Miss Hindley I had nine years ago the story of her father's fall. The author of the satire on the yeomaniy was my paternal grandfather, James Varley, of Pendleton. Chap.

Hers was the first school I ever attended, and I have a vivid recollection of the venerable, stately, little dame \u2014 a rigid martinet, exacting the utmost deference from all who approached her, and invariably addressed as ' Madam ' Broadbent. I have often since recalled my feelings of delight when for the first time I went with her and my schoolfellows in great state to the theatre, as described in her novel. She educated the daughters of most of the leading Manchester merchants of that day, the wife of a recent Mayor being one of them. \" Madame Broadbent did not profess the innumerable subjects now required, but all that was attempted was well taught. She inculcated habits of the strictest order, neatness, and regularity. The needlework was very beautiful, and would excite astonishment in these sewing machine days. The punishment for talking was very ludicrous. The delinquent was required to sit with her face to the wall\u2014 a hideous contrivance of red cloth called the ' red tongue ' hanging down her back ; it was considered a great disgrace. She succeeded in teaching a deaf and dumb girl to speak \u2014 a feat of which she was justly proud. \"If you think the above remarks on a character well known in Manchester during the early part of the present century are of interest, they are at your service. \"C. B. \"Rotherham, March 30th, 1879.\" I regret that at the time this letter- of so much interest to me\u2014 appeared, I was too ill to communicate with the writer through the medium of the newspaper, and so the opportunity . for thanks or correspondence was lost.

HH"], [568, "FINAL APPENDIX (HISTORICAL) The lapse of years since this novel was penned, the sweeping demolition of the town it describes, and the birth of generations who cannot recall it, not only furnish reasons for the issue of this pictoiial edition, but for the author to add somewhat to her former communications with her readers, before she, too, is swept away, and further annotation from her pen is impossible. The River Irk and Hunt's Bank Bridge\u2014 Chapters I. and XIII.\u2014 I have said that only an antiquary or a very old inhabitant \"could recall Manchester as it was at the close of the last century ; \" and time has since removed most of the old people who, leaning over the stout wooden railing along the embanked river-side, had stood to watch the Irk chafe its swift waters against the rocky base of Grammar School and College, or rush along in flood under the arch of Hunt's Bank Bridge to \"join the brimming\" Irwell; for this must have been before the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway shut it out of sight and memory. And I question if any but myself can remember to have seen the ancient cannon-ball imbedded in the rock below the College, for that may also have been covered up and buried. It is more than sixty years since my brother pointed it out to me as a memorial of the siege. The maps introduced into the volume will show at least where the river ran, and where Simon had his garden plot on Walker's Croft above the embankment, along with others. Chap. III.\u2014 The Seven Stars Inn is still in existence. It is said to be the most ancient inn in Lancashire. At all events, it has been a licensed house since the reign of Edward HI., the first licence having been granted A D. 1356 Being a county licence, the record was preserved in the Record Office, Lancaster Castle, but along with other documents relating to the Duchy of Lancaster has since been removed to London. There is a tradition that the workmen engaged in building the Parish Church, afterwards the Collegiate Church, and now the Cathedral, were paid a penny a day (or a peck of meal), and got their dinners at the \" Seven Stars Inn.\" Sixty or more years ago it was a noted resort for country carriers, \" Seven Stars Yard,\" in the rear (through which there was a convenient thoroughfare) never being without its complement of their covered carts and waggons from outlying or distant places. The ' Boar's Head \" at Hyde's Cross was another rendezvous of the kind, chiefly affected by the Cheshire carriers, who brought occasional passengers as well as baskets, boxes, and parcels, and never asked inconvenient questions in the interest of the Post Office."], [569, "Final Appendix. 467 Chaps. IV. \u2014 V. \u2014 The Sun Inn. \u2014 I am not aware of any ancient record of this inn, either as a licensed house or a private abode. It was brought into prominence when Mr. William Earnshaw, a native of Colne, one of my father's old friends, and the father of one of my pupils, migrated from Cheetham to become the landlord, drew round him the literary men of the town, and inscribed the legend on the front, \" Poets' Corner.\" This was in the early forties, when John Critchley Prince was in the ascendant, and lived over the way. the College Gateway initial, and again, School, comes a shoulder of antiquarian marks the sometime \" Poets' Fratorium.\" A glimpse of the inn may be seen through in the larger view ot the Old Grammar interest where a narrow strip of window The leather-breeches maker next door. the old inhabitants when I was young. whose name I have forgotten, was one of A railed area, and a descent into one of the cellar dwellings common at the time, necessitated an ascent of three or four steps to what was evidently the shop and workshop both. When buckskin-breeches were in vogue he had done a flourishing trade there, but in my time it was only kept alive by a few old customers, and those chiefly for making and cleaning buckskin gloves and braces. Chap. V. \u2014 The Bridgewater Hotel.\u2014 This hotel must have disappeared in the general onslaught on Market Street Lane, but I believe that the curious may still discover remains of the old stabling of Bridgewater Yard in a little back street leading out of High Street. Chap. V. \u2014 Colonel Hanson was extremely popular with the working people, who dubbed him \"the weavers' friend.\" His politics landed him in prison. On his release a gold cup, purchased by the united pence of 32,000 weavers, was presented to him at his residence, Strangeways Hall. His tenancy followed that of John Varley, my father's uncle, to one ot whose daughters he was engaged. For some private reason the match was abruptly broken off; whether on account of a duel he fought or for prudential reasons was not known. Chaps. AT. and XXI.\u2014 Manchester Infirmary. \u2014 This valuable institution has undergone many changes since it was originally founded by Mr. Joseph Bancroft and Mr. Charles White, the eminent and eccentric surgeon of King Street. At that time an ordinary dwelling-house in Garden Street, Salford, was obliged to suffice for the sick poor. It was but the experiment of two Samaritans. But so forcibly did it justify its existence in its utter inadequacy to meet the pressing claims upon it, that outer benevolence was stimulated : friends rallied round the first promoters, donations were ready, and Sir Oswald Mosley, Lord of the Manor, executed a conveyance of the waste land around, and including, the old Daub Hole, as a site for a more commodious building. Of this new Infirmary Mr. Miles Brown laid the first stone, and it was opened for patients in 1755, at a cost of ,\u00a34,000, Mr. James Massey being the first President. The Daub Hole (clay pit) where the ancient ducking-stool had served to cool the hot blood of cantankerous scolds, became a long pond railed in along with a still wider area devoted to shrubs and healing herbs. Ten years later a Lunatic Asylum rose in line with the Infirmary, though structurally apart. Such they remained for many years, the broad gravelled walk in front, with wide"], [570, "Final Appendix. 468 stretches of emerald grass on either hand, becoming the recognised promenade for Manchester merchants' and tradesmen's families after Divine service on Sunday mornings, albeit it was not called \"Church Parade.\" I may here mention that in 1766 simultaneous sermons -inaugurated by AVarden Peploe\u2014 were preached in all the Manchester churches in aid of this great institution, realising about \u00a3164, thus creating a precedent for \"Hospital Sunday\" a century in advance of the modern movement. It was not until 1781 that Public Baths were erected within the Infirmary area, close to the expansive triple gates, confronting the gardens, and turning a high blank wall to that end of George Street. Such was the Infirmary as it was connected with my narrative, and as it existed in 1S20, and as Mr. Fitton has depicted. I personally remember the lighting up of the clock with gas in 1825, and various later alterations in the building, such as the filling in of the gap between the Asylum aud the Infirmary proper. Then the fronting of the whole with stone, when a noble pillared portico was added to the facade, having an imposing ascent of several steps to the vestibule door. Within this vestibule was kept an old sedan chair which I recollect once seeing in use, and only once. And such, too, was the Infirmary through successive decades, until the sluggish pond\u2014 which in 1851 welcomed the visit of Queen Victoria with the spray from three upspringing fountains \u2014 was voted a nuisance, was dried up, as had been the chalybeate springs of the superseded baths, and its site was converted into a flagged esplanade, adorned with statues, and supplied with seats for the weary. But it is no longer the Infirmary of my childhood, or of my story, and no wilful Augusta could within its area find the convenient shrubbery in which to keep clandestine appointments with any \" darling Laurence.\" And now this is to be re-built. Chaps. VIII. to XII. \u2014 Chetham's Hospital or College. \u2014 The word hospital has for many years been associated with institutions for the reception and treatment of the sick or disabled. But when the benevolent merchant, Humphrey Chetham, made his will, and suggested the purchase of this stronghold on the Irk \u2014 the site of the Roman Pr\u00e6torium \u2014 as a home for poor and parentless boys, the word retained its monastic meaning of a guest-house, or hospitium, for the shelter and entertainment of way-worn or belated travellers, irrespective of rank or condition, hence its legal application to this foundation. Yet, for two previous centuries the building had been a College attached to Christ's Church, the pious priest-lord, Thomas de la Warr, having surrendered his baronial hall for the reception of the Warden and Fellows when he obtained Royal permission to collegiate the church, then newly-built of stone to replace an earlier structure of wood. The name of \" College \" stuck to the building, and very properly so, considering its two-fold dedication to learned and pious uses, whether as a home and school for the training of deserving boys, or as the repository of Chetham's unique library of rare and priceless books, open and free to the students of the world. It was thus the boys on Humphrey Chetham's foundation became known as \"College Boys.\" And long may they be so designated, albeit \"Owens College\" at the Chorlton end of the town now claims to be the Manchester College per se, having University rank."], [571, "Final Appendix. 469 Since the bygone days when Dr. Stone was librarian, and the present writer admitted Jabez Clegg to the privileges of the \" College,\" many changes and alterations have taken place in and around the citadel on the rock. These call for notice in this historical appendix, not only for the preservation of memorials swept away within the past half-century, but for the behoof of readers of the present generation. The first marked innovation began in 1844-5 w''h 'he Manchester and Leeds Railway Company (now the Lancashire and Yorkshire) when the directors, who had already made havoc of AValker's Croft, and the Cholera Burial-ground, lacking space for the extension of offices, arched over the Irk from Hunt's Bank all along beneath the College, which they would fain have absorbed likewise, had it been possible. Prior to that intrusion, the College had possessed several outlets to the river, at one time well stocked with fish. There were the Dairy-steps (initial I), the steps to the old Pump-court (initial J), others to the Boat-house, and a long flight which must still be visible clinging to the outer wall, and only terminating at the upper level of what is now known as the Governor's Garden. This I am informed by the present courteous Governor, Mr. AValter T. Browne, was formerly called the Scurvy Gatden. He says : \" The reason it obtained this name is because in the early days of the school, the boys afflicted with zymotic diseases were confined here apart like the lepers of old. They also slept apart in the three small cells adjoining, now used for other purposes.\" All these steps rose from a narrow platform of rock slightly raised above the river at low water, and more or less covered in stormy or showery weather. It is just thirty years ago \u2014 1866 \u2014 since I visited the College for the purposes of this story, and, after a brief chat with my old friend, Mr. James Crossley, the bibliographer, and Mr. Thomas Jones, the librarian, Mr. Richard Hanby, the gentle and genial house-governor, conducted me over the building, from cellerage to dormitory. I then discovered that \"change,\" under the name of \"Progress\" had begun its work internally. To provide more room tor the library, the old museum had been displaced, and the bulk (or the \" rubbish,\" according to Mr. John Plant, curator) transferred to the Peel Park Museum, where its significance was lost. The dingy curios, there of no account, were part of the antiquity of the College, telling of a time before steam brought the ends of the world into contact, when an alligator or a porpoise was a curiosity to be prized and exhibited, and science had not made the human skeleton familiar to the young. To me it seemed as if a leaf had been violently rent from the archives of the Hospital and of my memory. How often had I in my childhood followed, with open ears and eyes alert, some Blue-coat cicerone as he ran over, like a parrot's roll, the list of curios ranged on shelves protected by a network of brass wire, or mounted high on walls or over doorways, when I had wished he would not gabble on so fast, but leave time for closer inspection. There was generally another guide with a separate party close on his heels, and no doubt this frequent iteration would be annoying to studious readers who had only the holiday time for research, for one of these committed his irritation to print, and so preserved an inventory of an earlier date than that of Mr. John Rylance (himself an \" old boy \") or that the Rev. John Henn has included in his \" Memoir of Richard Hanby \" In producing"], [572, "Final Appendix. 470 this catalogue, for which I am indebted to another \" old boy,\" Mr. John Lea, of Sale, I am omitting a splenetic prelude little to the \u2022 purpose, and beg leave to say it is otherwise precisely given as I have heard, and can recall, \"TIM BOBBIN'S ' Choice Oratorical Catalogue ' of the rare aud valuable Curiosities in the College Library, Manchester.

No pictures then dis puted precedence with that of the Founder above the fireplace, at least on that side ofthe room That of Humphrey Chetham's brother above the doorway, and those of Bradford, the Martyr, and Hugh Oldham by its side, were unseen by the \"boobies\" who stood with awe upon the threshold, and they had no place in the vocal category. Consequently the pictures included in the catalogues of Mr. Rylance and Mr. Henn,"], [573, ""], [574, "REFECTORY, CHETHAM HOSPITAL."], [575, "Final Appendix. 471 along with other articles they include, belong to a period beyond the range of \" The Manchester Man.\" Yet in justice to myself and those who may expect to find the College exactly as I pourtrayed it, I must add that between my explorations under the guidance of Mr. Hanby and my last visit, when a Mr. Tinkler did the honours, years had slipped by, and many had been the changes, even structurally. My new guide omitted to say that the improvements he vaunted had been made, when in 18S2-4 Oliver Heywood. Esq., one of the Feoffees, had munificently furnished funds for the repair of the entire building, but he exultingly pointed to the discovery of a large recess, and a fine raftered ceiling in the refectory, previously concealed under lath and plaster. I was shown how the removal of the ancient and effete museum had made the library more commodious, how fresh portraits had been admitted to the com panionship of the Founder in the renovated reading-room, and where a secret door had been discovered in the oak-panelling by a boy, a door leading by a private staircase to the Minstrel's gallery and to the cloisters. I admitted the undoubted improvements, but I felt as if old memories had been disturbed. The cellarage I did not ask to see. The changes there have only recently been revealed to me. But when Mr. Tinkler led me forth into the play ground to inspect a brand new schoolroom, and I beheld a troop of boys in common suits of corduroy, the shock overpowered me, I waxed indignant, and if I did not say all I thought of the change, I certainly asked how the boys came to be clad otherwise than in the reputable long blue-coat prescribed by Humphrey Chetham's will, the mercantile style of his period ? Some shuffling apology of insufficient funds was made, but I left the old building full of ire at the paltry disregard of the Founder's will, and his motto. \" Quad tuum tene.\" I have: however, lately been much gratified by hearing from Mr. AV. T. Browne that measures were on foot for the restoration of the time-honoured uniform, and that probably before these lines are in print the College yard may be again traversed by Blue-coat boys, as proud of their attire as are those of Christ Church School, London. And respecting the costume, let me say that in this edition I have given the boys yellow stockings at the instance of an individual much my elder, and I believe an \" Old Boy.\" Those of the Christ Church boys are yellow. But Baines, in his \u25a0' History and Gazetteer,\" date 1825, describes Chetham's as blue. And dark blue they were as I remembered and described them originally, probably the result of an innovation prior to the historian's date. Chap. XXIX. \u2014 Ardwick Green Pond. \u2014 Like the Infirmary pond, this has ceased to be a memory to any but persons of middle age, it has been so long filled up, the Green bein\" now an acknowledged public recreation ground. It was always so more or less within my recollection and many years before that. The pond, shaped something like the London \" Serpentine,\" was surrounded by a broad border of grassy turf, here and there planted with trees and bushes. AVith the exception of a small paved space at the upper end, in form like a horse-shoe, bounded by a stone coping, and which was set apart for the watering of horses and catt'e, the whole Green was surrounded by stout wooden posts, connected by thick bars of wrought iron, the entire enclosure"], [576, "Final Appendix. 472 being traditionally reputed to measure a mile round. School boys and girls, who had holidays, made it a recreation ground (there were no holidays then for the children of the poor), and the horizontal bars from frequent use by amateur gymnasts became warped and distorted. The bars gave place to chains, which served quite as well to swing upon. At Whitsuntide and other grand processional celebrations, the Sunday-school children were ranged within this enclosure to sing hymns and the National Anthem ; and the girls being mostly dressed in white, with white caps and tippets, it was a very pretty and interesting sight. In winter, when frost bound the lakelet, it was taken possession of by boys and men as an established skating ground, and nobody said them nay. So that it was a recognised recreation ground before the Green was formally made over to the Corporation, and robbed of its chief attraction. The pond could scarcely have been stagnant, if it was true a brooklet ran through its length and kept it fresh. In the old maps it is styled a \" Canal.\" Certainly soot might accumulate on its surface in these later days ; but sixty years ago the young angler might find more than jack-sharps there, for horse-mussels were abundant. And at least one old Lancashire conchologist added to his collection from its depths, since specimens of Planorbis, Spherium and Limn\u00e6a, collected by the hand now dead, have been added to my collection by a kind Manchester scientific friend as historical relics of a pond which has also ceased to exist. The pond was not altogether without its tragedy, for when I was about nine years old a sine young woman, named Eliza , summarily dismissed from her situation close by, drowned herself by bending over the coping at the watering-place. She had formerly been my baby-sister's nurse. Chaps. V., VI., XII., &c- Oldham Street. \u2014 This thoroughfare, so closely con nected with the incidents of this story, and the history of the town, had no existence until 1772, when the highway through Newton to Oldham was selected by members of the Newton family and others, for tbe erection of good Georgian houses of red brick, suited to the requirements of merchants and private gentlemen. They were houses of which Gower Street, London, may stand as a type, having similar pillared doorways and fanlights, similar steps of broad flags, and, in most cases, areas railed in to protect the steps descending to the basement kitchens. Such they were when the main events recorded in these pages passed into history In a very few years shops began to invade the residential street ; then the areas and the basements became tenanted by working craftsmen, who made there lhe goods they had for sale, and executed repairs, in some cases living there entirely ; otherwise they served as workshops or storehouses for the ground-floor tradesmen whose goods demanded space. At the corner of Dale Street was a many-pinnacled Wesleyan Chapel, celebrated for its connection with John Wesley, who had preached therein, notably at its opening. Now, the chapel has gone the way of private abodes, projecting steps and areas, and from end to end the busy thoroughfare has been given up to enterprising shopkeepers, who have remodelled and extended frontages so that the Oldham Street in which the \" Manchester Man \" is published is not to be recog nised as that in which the writer was born in 1821. Chats. AT. and XX.\u2014 New Cross.\u2014 This Cross, which may be found marked on the map for 1807, at the junction of the four wide thoroughfares -Oldham Street,"], [577, "Final Appendix. 473 Ancoats Lane, Newton Lane (now Oldham Road), and Swan Street (then New Cross Street) \u2014 was the centre round which clustered an open-air market and shambles in the early years of this century. It was known as \" New Cross Market,\" and long years after the wholesale fruit and vegetable markets had been removed for centralisa'ion to the wide area of Smithfield and Shudehill, and the butchers removed to newly-built shambles lying between Swan Street and Smithfield, where dealers in pottery, tinware, baskets, toys, and cast-off clothes, had been drawn as into a focus, the name remained, though the Cross had been taken down in 1821, and New Cross Market it continued to be called for years afterwards, to my knowledge, whatever it might be officially. Even the stall-keepers were loth to quit their old ground, and edged into Swan Street, until the shopkeepers rose against their intrusion as a nuisance, and they were peremptorily \" moved on.\" AA'hat became of the Cross, or what was its architectural appearance. I could never ascertain, though I asked many questions about it when I was young and its removal recent ; and unless it was in a ruinous condition I think it might have been allowed to remain, since it marked a place of sepulture, for there, twenty years later, were unearthed the skeletons of suicides a cruel law had denied more sacred ground. However, if Laurent's plan may be trusted, it was more a monument than a cross, and consisted of an elongated cone or spire, on a square, fluted pedestal, having a low step cr two round the base. and a light fane surmounting the spire. It has, anyway, left its name on the locality. Chaps. I and XIII.\u2014 The Irk and its Bridges.\u2014 Of these, the one at Hunt's Bank, where the Irk debouches into the Irwell (though under cover) must be the most ancient, since here by the Pr\u00e6torium was the Roman Road to Ribchester, and a biidge becomes a foregone conclusion, though it might not be the precise one Mr. Fitton has depicted as coeval with College and old Houses of Correction, and which we find marked on maps as Irk Bridge or Hunts Bank Biidge indiscriminately. Farther up the river, beyond the Grammar School and a short row of dwelling-houses, the steep descent of a narrow alley under the frowning walls of the Town Mill, landed your footsteps on a strong wooden erection, having an earthen floor, and known as Mill Brow Bridge. It was the common footway from Millgate to AA'alker's Croft, and overlooked the first mill-dam on the Irk. Still higher up the stream, and closed in by the Millgate line of houses, was the very ancient pile denominated Tanners' Bridge, which had been swept away long ere the houses opposite to Millers' Lane were demolished to make way in 1814 for the wide arch of Ducie Bridge, and the new highway through Cheetham to the North. Prior to this the only route had been through narrow Long Millgate to an abrupt turn and steep descent just by Pinmill Brow to Scotland Bridge (the last of the Irk bridges within our scope), and thence up the twice-lowered acclivity of Red Bank, toilsome to the pedestrian, and for vehicular traffic intolerable. Travellers to Scotland no longer use the bridge or the road cut through the red sandy hill, and the obvious nomenclature of the bridge itself has become a puzzle for the curious. Chap. XVI.\u2014 Simon's Garden Plot. \u2014 A glance at the map for 1807 will show where a number of such plots were grouped together It was then quite a practice for a tradesman confined all the week to shop or warehouse to have a garden plot and"], [578, "Final Appendix. 474 summer-house outside the town where he and his family might take their ease on Sunday afternoons in summer time It must be remembered that business hours were long ; there were no weekly half-holidays for employers or employed, whilst suburban residences were few and far between, and tenanted by the well-to-do. No wonder then that tradespeople and artizans betook themselves to the green fields on Sunday afternoons, or that tea-gardens came into existence, while humbler caterers cultivated garden plots, as did Simon Clegg, and purveyed posies and summer fruits. Chaps. XVIII. and XLVL\u2014 The Neav Bailey. \u2014 Until 1790 the only gaol in Manchester was the House 01 Correction on Hunt's Bank, under the very shadow ot the College. But this, notwithstanding re-building, became so utterly inadequate for the growing needs of the town (partly owing to the blood-money system for the manufacture of criminals), that after an Act ot Parliament had been obtained, the New Bailey Prison was erected on the Salford side of the Irwell, with its frontage to the river. Its appearance on completion may be seen in the initial to Chapter XLVI. But though it was opened in 1790 for the admission of prisoners, many years elapsed before its completion. Its nucleus was a central building constructed on John Howard's plan, and shaped so as to permit a warder at the centre to have the whole four wards or alleys within his view, a system of signalling by tablet allowing the prisoners to communicate with the gaoler. It was three storeys high, but manifestly too small for the requirements of Manchester and Salford in those unsettled times, although offenders beyond magisterial jurisdiction were carted off to Lancaster for trial. However, a wider area had to be walled in, and gradually other accommodation provided under the shadow of the newly-extended southern wall. And in time, even before the passing of the Prisons Act in 1823, workshops were set up along the south-eastern wall, where the prisoners were usefully employed in batting, tailoring (for prison wear), shoe, mat, rug, or basket making, instead of herding together like cattle, as had been the case in too many common gaols. And I have little doubt the horrors and abuses in Ilchester Gaol, brought to light by Henry Hunt's demand for a Commission to inquire into its condition during his incarceration there as a political offender, had no little influence in the amendment of the law. At all events, the treadmill\u2014 invented in 181 7 \u2014 was not set up in the New Bailey Prison until 1824, and the first person sent to it was a woman-servant who had robbed my parents very extensively. This treadmill ground dyewoods for manufacturers, and was therefore made to pay its expenses. I saw it in use when, with this novel in contemplation, and armed with a sufficient order, I was shown over the prison, which I had previously contemplated only from its exterior. But as the whole edifice has long been razed to the ground, a few words anent that exterior may not be out ot place. I need not tell middle-aged people that its frontage and entrance were in Satnley Street, high up above the Irwell, which it frowned down upon. Strong iron gates gave access to a space a few yards wide, bounded by as strong an iron gate or grating. (It was within this narrow space the bodies recovered after the wreck of the Emma were laid out for identification.) As at Newgate (the Old Bailey), the symbolic fetters or leg-irons were suspended above the entrance, and conveyed no idle threat when the century was in its teens. The Governor's house, slightly recessed"], [579, "Final Appendix. 475 beyond this entrance, was situated above the ground floor and magisterial offices, and was approached by a double flight of steps with a very needful handrail. It may, perhaps, be remembered that the square outer walls of the prison were exceedingly high and massive, with bastions at the four corners, pierced with loop-holes for musketry, as were the upper walls. It was not thus originally. Twice within my own recollection had those walls been raised and strengthened. In the first instance, above the original wall of rustic masonry, surmounted by a chevaux-de-frise, rose a course of brick-work to a higher level, to which the revolving chevaux-de-frise was transferred as an additional security. Rioting and tumult had apparently rendered the precaution necessary. Later riots, turn-outs, incendiary fires, and other acts of violence still more menacing, caused the authorities again to increase the elevation of the walls with brick-work, adding the loop holes and bastions to awe the threatening multitude. I was not of an age to specialize these separate riots, having unfortunate'y known so many, but I could not pass the New Bailey to visit my Grandfather Varley without observing these changes, and inquiring the reason. Mosley Street. \u2014 There were no warehouses in this street during the period covered by this narrative. If other manufacturers there were, they had their business premises in the rear, with entrances in the narrow back streets, as had my Ashton prototype. It was essentially a residential quarter for private families and physicians of repute, It was, moreover, studded with public buildings. The Royal Hotel occupied the corner at the Piccadilly end, with an outlook across the Infirmary pond. A few yards beyond rose an unobtrusive Unitarian Chapel, having a very small burial-ground wedged in between the chapel and other premises. I remember the outcry made against the desecration of this cramped-up place of sepulture, when the site of the chapel was required for a warehouse ; an outcry which only subsided when the purchasers agreed to arch over the place of the dead, and build above the arched foundation Higher up, cornering Charlotte Street, the plain \u2014 not to say ugly- Assembly Rooms gave to Mosley Street something of an aristocratic status, confronted as it was with the pillared facade of the Portico. A large and well-attended Independent Chapel occupied the third corner of Charlotte Street, beyond the Assembly Rooms. Higher up still, abutting on Princess Street, was an exclusive \"Academy for young gentlemen,\" and close beyond that, like two prim and antiquated spinsters retiring from the obtrusive crush of modern society, two quaint and neat two-storey houses stood back as it were in a recess, railed in behind a flagged forecourt, as clean as the windows and bright brass knockers. But the second decade of the century had worn itself out before St. Peter's solitary Church (guiltless of dome, or spire, or steeple) looked down an unbroken vista of brick and stone. It stood ''a thing apart\" for many years after the fugitives from Peterloo rushed past, pursued by horsemen with flashing sabres. Yet the church had been completed, and commerce had taken full possession of Mosley Street long ere a line of the \"Manchester Man\" was penned, and tram-cars have now usurped the place where private carriages rolled in state on great occasions. Chap. XIX. and XX.\u2014 Peterloo.\u2014 By one of Time's strange ironies the Free Trade Hall now occupies a portion of the extensive plot of waste ground known in 1819 as"], [580, "476 Final Appendix. St. Peter's Fields, from its proximity to St. Peter's Church, and which in that year obtained unenviable notoriety as Peterloo Fields. At that date AVaterloo was so recent an event that the mental association of the two names was a natural sequence when the atrocious attack of armed cavalry on a defenceless multitude of men, women, and children converted the ground into another Aceldama. By whomsoever originated the woful catastrophe was by common consent spoken of as the \"Peterloo Massacre,\" the \"Battle of Peterloo,\" and the designations passing from fathers to sons have so come down to us. An objection has been raised to my introduction of artillery, as untrue to history. I described what my near relations saw and knew. Further, it is stated by Edward Baines, who, I believe, was one of the reporters present\u2014 \" The military, consisting of the Manchester and Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry, the 15th Hussars, a detachment of the 85th Regiment of Foot, and some pieces of royal artillery, were all in readiness, but they were not then seen by the persons forming the meeting.\" And again, \"The panic-struck reformers, with all the banners and emblems, fled in all directions, while some of those at a distance threw stones and brick-bats at the Yeomanry, who galloped over the field in triumph, chasing the fugitives. The Cheshire Yeomanry, and the 15th Hussars, who had now reached the ground, followed by two pieces of flying artillery, assisted to clear the field,\" &c. AA'heeler, in his \" History of Manchester,\" also says, \"Thanks were sent 'officially' to persons who had rendered active service in maintaining order, which comprised the Manchester and Cheshire Yeomanry, the 15th Hussars, detachments of the 88th and the 31st Foot, with pieces of artillery,\" &c. The statement of Mr. Archibald Prentice was \u2014 \"Near to the field, ready the moment their services were required, were six troops of the 15th Hussars, a troop of horse aitillery with two guns,\" &c. This combined testimony, I think, dispels all doubt of my accuracy. And these historians testify something more, namely, that the onslaught was made before the Riot Act was read, and that solely to enable Nadin to execute his warrant for the arrest of the speakers, his force of 200 constables being (according to his representations) insufficient to support him. The Magistrate who read the Riot Act was, I believe, Parson YVray, as he was called in my time. The memory of this inhuman outrage was not soon permitted to die out of the Manchester mind ; for so surely as Peterloo Day came round, it was commemorated by a long procession of working-men, headed by an immense banner on which the scene of the massacre was represented with startling effect, if not with consummate art. Year after year I beheld the long procession and its ponderous banner until I had outgrown my childhood and any likelihood of forgetfulness. But when these annual processions were abandoned, or what became of the scenic banner, I have no means of ascertaining. For a long while I have been under the impression that Mr. Henry AA'haite, of Bridge Street (who went over to the majority six-and-twenty years back), was the painter, as well as the producer of the banner. And I fear, in my endeavours to assure myself of the fact and establish the identity of the Peterloo picture (there being a second in existence), that I have been troublesome to his descendants, both of the first and second generation, who have courteously"], [581, "Final Appendix. 477 endeavoured to recover \"the missing link\" for me. Mr, AA'haite made the banner, that I knew, whosoever painted it ; and I have come to the conclusion, taxing my own memory, that the crude engraving bearing the signature of Jas. AArroe \u2014 a Radical of the Radicals\u2014 and disseminated so freely during the \"Old Manchester\" Exhibition, is simply a reduction in black and white of the highly-coloured scene upon the banner ; and is not truly representative. There is another and much superior picture of Peterloo extant, an engraving of which was published with the following dedication : \u2014 \"TO HENRY HUNT, ESQ, as Chairman of the Meeting assembled on St. Peter's Field, Manchester, on the 16th of August, 1S19, and to the Female Reformers of Manchester and the adjacent Towns, who were exposed to and suffered from the Wanton and Furious Attack made on them by that brutal armed force, The Manchester and Cheshire Yeomanry Caa'alry, This plate is dedicated by their Fellow Labourer, RICHARD CARLILE.\" \" (Published Aug. I, lS\u2014 (indistinct) by Rd. Carlile, jj. Fleet St., London.)\" Of this \u2014 which is evidently a faithful representation of the awful scene\u2014 I have been most anxious to preserve a copy here, and only relinquish my proposal with extreme reluctance on my publisher's assurance that the fine lines of the old photograph possessed by Mr. Fitton are too faint for reproduction by modern processes. No artist's signature is distinguishable, yet it is with scarcely a doubt a facsimile of the oil-painting by Mr. Thomas Whaite, and formerly in the possession of his nephew, Mr. Frederick A. Whaite, of Bridge Street, whose pictures were unfortunately dispersed nearly a dozen years ago, and all clue to its whereabouts lost. AVherever it may be, it is a picture of historic value, and should belong to the City. It is no fancy sketch. It has certainly been painted by an eye-witness, who mastered all the details upon the spot. And the brothers Henry and Thomas Whaite, with a brother-in-law named Richardson, were all upon the field as adherents of the cause of Radical reform, and of Henry Hunt as its exponent. According to Bradley, the artist, Thomas AA'haite was the best portrait painter in Manchester, and that the principal individuals in even the faint photo are portraits any old inhabitant of the town might testify, as I can. Not only may the clerical magistrate at the open window on the lest be readily identified, but Henry Hunt and his supporters upon the waggon-platform, with horror depicted in every feature. The whole scene is realistic ; from the lady sabred in the barouche, to the panic-stricken fugitives trampling on their fallen fellows, regardless of all but the instinct of self-preservation ; husbands dragging at their wives ; women clasping their babes ; the wounded lying unheeded underfoot; the deserted child imploring mercy from the mounted barbarian about to smite ; the meagre, half-famished man turning in his flight to clench his fist and curse the slashing cavalry ; it has all the impress of truth. The uniforms are as real as their reckless wearers : and there can be no mistaking the multitude for anything"], [582, "478 Final Appendix. but Lancashire operatives of all grades, clad after the manner of the period, as fortune or misfortune had the upper hand. This is really the picture of Peterloo. And I am truly sorry no reproduction can be offered to my readers of an historic relic of so much interest I am equally sorry that a portrait of Mrs. Broadbent, also by Thomas AVhaite, could not be given, being also lost. Chap. XIX. \u2014 The Star Inn. \u2014This inn, which obtained so much notoriety from its connection with Peterloo, was then the principal coaching-house at the Deansgate end of the town, and the \"Star Inn\" yard was like the \"Bridgewater,\" noted for its capacity to accommodate horses and vehicles without count. At that time it was not altogether detached. Across what is now an open street, an arched roof extended from the side door of the inn to the dingy brick wall of Bridge Street Market (or shambles), and this, which was called the Arcade, formed the covered way to the stabling in the rear. The Market, which has disappeared, might be commodious within, but it was enclosed in as unlovely a wall of brick-work as ever disgraced a town. Each alley of the square market had a separate entrance about the width of a respectable doorway, and as if to prevent the intrusion of any four-footed beast larger than a sheep dog, an iron post was set up under each archway, so that a buyer of robust proportions would need to rest her basket on the post to obtain an entrance. But no doubt the market brought country customers to the \" Star Inn \" and the inn yard, long before it aspired to rank as the \" Star Hotel.\" The Arcade had vanished before my day. Chap. XArI. &c\u2014 The Assembly Rooms. \u2014 The original shareholders, with a desire to render these rooms exclusive and aristocratic, laid down a law that no tradesman or manufacturer, whatever might be his wealth, should obtain admission under the charmed roof. Any puppy in uniform, any member of one of the three black-coated learned professions, was eligible, and the ladies they might present, but their lordships ignored trade. And so long as private gentry, with or without titles, resided within the town or in the immediate suburbs, the law was strictly kept. But as the town advanced, and a new type of manufacturers came to the front, the stringent rule, which threatened the Assembly Rooms with dissolution, had to be modified, otherwise neither the Aspinalls nor the Ashtons could have penetrated the exclusive circle. Chap. XXXIX.\u2014 \"Alinda ; or, The Child of Mystery.\" \u2014 This was one of four novels written by Sophia M'Gibbon, the actress, a great favourite on the Manchester boards. She was the daughter of AA'oodfall, the reporter to the House of Commons, and the printer of \"The Letters of Junius.\" At that time Parliamentary reporters were not permitted to take notes. Yet AVoodfall's newspaper, The Advertiser, was sure to have verbatim reports of the speeches on the morning after a debate. The secret was this : His daughter Sophia, then only about thirteen, sat up waiting for him until whatever hour the House closed. Then, with a flying pen, she set down the speeches as they fell verbatim .rom his lips, and \"copy\" was ready for the printer. It was this faculty procured him the soubriquet of \" Memory AVoodsall,\" As with mo\u00abt fluent writers, her penmanship was execrable."], [583, "Final Appendix. 479 Chap. XLIV.\u2014 Barlow Hall.\u2014 By the kind intervention of Mr. Thomas Letherbrow, and the gracious permission of Sir William Cunliffe Brookes, I am enabled for the first time io name and to present views of the old hall at Fallowfield in which those incidents in Augusta Ashton's married life which formed the original basis of my novel absolutely took place. As I named to Mr. Letherbrow the real prototype of Aspinall, there was no difficulty in identifying his home, and to both the former gentlemen my thanks are due. Chap. XXIII. \u2014 Clogs. \u2014 I find that much misapprehension exists respecting the Lancashire clogs, and that they are confounded in the popular mind with the sabots or wooden shoon of France and Holland. They differ in this respect. The sabots are entirely of wood. Of the clogs only the thick soles are of wood, to which stout upper leathers are closely nailed round. Chap. XLVI. \u2014 The Irwell at New Bailey Bridge. \u2014 This was the scene of the fatal launch of the Emma. On the right of Mr. Fitton's sketch is the New Quay, where the flat (or barge) was built. On the left is the o'd towing path. A long steep flight of steps clinging to the higher embankment, below the visible railings, and guarded by such another hand-rail, gave access to this path, and served passengers going to and from the AA'arrington and Runcorn packet-boats which there found a landing stage. They were something like elongated and flat-topped Noah's arks; the flat roofs serving for outside passengers as on our present tram-cars and omnibuses. The house-boat is a glorified imitation. Samuel Bamford has said, \"Venice hath its Bridge of Sighs, Manchester hath its Bridge of Tears,\" and this is appro priately so named, not merely on account of the Emma catastrophe, but on account ot the numbers who had crossed it on their way to the prison frowning down upon the stream, crossed it to their doom; for when it was built the death-penalty was exacted for very light offences. Chap. IV. \u2014 Long Millgate and Clegg's Yard. \u2014 There is a shadowy suggestion of a factory at the right of Mr. Fitton's picture, which locates the old houses. The factory looked up Hanover Street, and the entry to the yard I have assigned to Simon Clegg was there when I was a girl in my teens. But by that time the two houses nearest the entry had given place to others less tumble-down, though the yard and the narrow tunnel which gave access to it were still in evidence, and the old tripe-dealer did a busy trade among his cool stone tanks. Chap. XI. \u2014 The Market Place and Exchange. \u2014 There has been such a wholesale destruction of ancient houses and thoroughfares, and an opening out of more imposing new ones in the centre of what is now the \" City of Manchester,\" that I fear, but for the foot of Market-street Lane coming into Mr. Fitton's picture, readers of the present generation will scarcely be able to locate or realise it without reference to a map. A'et here, for centuries, had been the principal maiket of the town, spreading its open stalls down narrow Smithy Door on the left, and Short Millgate on the right as far as the obscurely covered-in poultry mart and shambles. And here, in the last century, when the stocks and pillory were institutions as venerable as the Market Cross beside them, there stood, not the handsome circular-fronted Exchange here depicted, but a small erection more like a country market-hall than the commercial building it professed to be,"], [584, "Final Appendix. 480 whereon were spiked the decapitated heads 01 three Manchester Jacobites to overawe their fellow townsmen. In 1792 this first Exchange-having been abandoned and become a foul lazaretto\u2014 was taken down, aud its site remained unoccupied save by a stone pillar and posts. The fine circular-fronted Exchange was quite a new erection when Jabez, with Ben Travis as companion, went his errand to Harrop, the printer's, next door to the Post Office, which had not yet been removed to the back of the new Exchange. The stocks, pillory, and cross were still in situ, and I had hoped Mr. Fitton might have included them in his picture, had the same courtesy been extended in this direction which we found elsewhere. But now the Market has been shifted, and even the second Exchange, notwithstanding its extension towards St. Ann's Square, is itself a thing of the past, so far forgotten that a writer in the Queen's Jubilee year ignored its existence altogether, and accredited the scenic representation of the first Exchange in the i; Old \"Manchester '' Exhibition as that of the only predecessor of the immense pile where merchants most do congregate in this day, which presents its frontage to Cross Street, takes a long slice out of Market Street, and rejoices in being the Exchange of a great city and sea-port, not a mere town. Chaps. X., XL, &c.\u2014 George Pilkington.\u2014 I cannot close this historical and topographical appendix without a few words anent the genial old acquaintance of my girlhood. I used to meet him at the house of intimate friends, before I had any foreshadowing of my career as a novelist, or any inkling of the great good there was in the man it was my proud privilege to chat with so pleasantly. Indeed, I had introduced him into my novel simply as a Blue-coat boy, before I knew how modestly, yet how effectively, he had testified his gratitude to his benefactor, Humphrey Chetham, to whose foundation he was indebted for the training which had paved his way to fortune. A grateful and a generous heart only could have prompted such an expression of reverence for his Alma-Mater, as he has stamped in marble and placed in the sacred house of God, where he, the Blue-coat boy, sang and worshipped with his schoolmates. There was no monument to the far-seeing, liberal merchant, until George Pilkington raised to his memory, and that of his foundation, the statue of which an engraving is here presented, and did it without any parade of his own name whatsoever. This book may pass to readers who have never entered our city, or its Cathedral, so I think I do well to preserve the memory of one Blue-coat boy\u2014 one true Manchester man\u2014 who combined the three virtues of gratitude, modesty, and generosity. And lest I should be deemed wanting in the first of these attributes, I hasten to thank all those who in any way have furthered my endeavours to preserve an historical picture of the Manchester which existed when I was young, but which has passed away from the sight and memory of the present generation. Of these I can only name gratefully, Sir William Cunliffe Brookes, Mr. Walter T. Browne, Mr. John Lea, Mr. Thomas Letherbrow, Mr. Albert Nicholson, Mr. Chas. Sutton, librarian, and his brother, Mr. Albert Sutton, Mr. Clarence AA'haite, P.R.C.A., and his nephew, Mr. Herbert AA'haite. ISABELLA BANKS.
