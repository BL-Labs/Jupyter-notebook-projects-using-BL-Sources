ELLIS JONES, STEAM BOOK AND JOB PRINTER. iSq7-"], [8, "Copyrighted, 1897."], [9, "INTRODUCTION. The section in Virginia comprised within the present county of Middlesex, was at first included in Lancaster county and parish. Some time before 1666 that parish was divided into two portions, separated by the Rappahanhock river, and the new parishes were named Lancaster and Pyanketank. In 1666 they were reunited under the name of Lancaster, but a few years later again was separated and acquired the organization which they retained through the Colonial period, as Christ Church, Lancaster, and Christ Church, Middlesex. The register of the latter is printed in this book. The vestry-book of Christ Church, Middlesex, beginning in 1663 and ending in 1767, which is now preserved at the Episcopal Theological Seminary, Alex ander county, Va., shows that a Mr. Morris was minister from 1663 to 1666. He was succeeded in 166S by Rev. John Shepherd, who at the time of his death in 1683, is described by his vestry as \"our late worthy minister.\" In November of that year Major-General Robert Smith, one of the vestry, who had been commissioned to procure a minister, returned from England, bringing with him Rev. Duell Pead. This clergyman served the parish acceptably for seven years and then returned to England, where, it is be lieved, he became rector of Newland, St. Lawrence, Essex. Rev. Mathew Lidford, Mr. Pead's successor in 1692, only lived about a year, and was in turn followed by Rev. Samuel Gray, a most unworthy minister, who was tried for his life, for causing the death of one of his slaves by a severe whip ping. This, it is presumed, caused his resignation or expulsion, as in 1699 the minister was Rev. Robert Yates, who continued until 1703 or 1704, when he returned to England in ill health. He appears to have been esteemed by his vestry, who continued his salary for some time in hope of his return. In 1704 he was succeeded by his son Bartholomew Yates, B. A., Brasenose Col lege, Oxford, 1698, who continued to be the much loved and trusted incum bent, until his death on July 26, 1734. He was also a visitor and pro fessor of William and Mary College. A tomb erected by his parishioners at Christ Church, bears testimony to the high regard in which he was held. Rev. John Klug succeeded to Mr. Yates in 1767, and, it is believed, con tinued until his death in 1795. He is represented to have been a pious and efficient minister. The church now standing in the parish was built in 1712, and succeeded one, on the same spot, which was ordered to be built in 1666. Bishop Meade says of the parish: \" This being an early settlement, lying on one of the finest rivers in Virginia, and near the bay, we might expect to"], [10, "find here many os the ancestors of some of the most respectable families of Virginia. As the vestrymen were chosen from the leading citizens of each parish, we shall give, in the order in which they appear on the vestry-book for more than a hundred years, a full list of all who served the parish in that capacity. Those who have any acquaintance with the Virginia families, and with many who have dispersed themselves throughout the West and South, will readily trace great numbers to the parish of which we are treating. For the sake of brevity, we shall only mention the surnames.
