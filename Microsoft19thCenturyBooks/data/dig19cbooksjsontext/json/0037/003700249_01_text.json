THE HOME IN BRISTO STREET."], [16, ""], [17, "I. LADY SOMERVILLE'S HOSPITAL. A BOUT the year of the Union of Scotland with England, the Merchant Maidens' Hospital and the Trades' Maidens' Hospital of Edinburgh, were founded by sums subscribed by the benevo lent, and by gifts from Mrs. Janet Erskine, a wealthy widow descended from the noble house of Mar, and noted for her charitable benefactions to the Scottish capital. The purpose of these in stitutions was to shelter and nurture the daugh ters of merchants and tradesmen of the city who had died in destitute condition, or dragged on life in decayed circumstances. Other pious ladies of condition and substance, following Mrs. Janet's example, were anxious to establish similar institu-"], [18, "The Diamond Rose. 4 tions, without being able to incorporate them by royal charters, or to render them permanent bene fits ; \u2014 and this not to atone for their sins by good works, but rather with the desire of relieving the needy on a considerable scale ; although doubt less there was, in some cases, a yearning wish to embalm the name of the testatrix, and preserve it a venerable and cherished memory through succeeding generations. In this class, but not of it in any selfish sense, was Lady Somerville, of long pedigree and \u2014 greater marvel \u2014 long purse, widow of an umquhile provost of the good town. She executed a deed of gift, or, in Scots legal phrase, \"mortified\" a sum of money for the maintenance of a hospital, where fifteen young girls, gentle women, were to be educated, and whence they were to be started in life, under the name of \" Lady Somerville's Maidens.\" Lady Somerville's Hospital, like the Merchant Maidens', was in Bristo Street. This Bristo Street was not then the insignificant side street which it is in the present day. It was an important suburb of the West Port, beyond which as yet stretched no"], [19, "Lady Somerville s Hospital. 5 stately and flourishing new town. It was a natural situation for such foundations, having the country and the country air on the one side, and on the other the steep, tortuous, and noisy West Bow, which ran from the Bow-street Well and the Grass-market up to the main line of the High Street. Neither was it without its dignities and distinctions. The name, \" General's Entry,\" where Monk lodged when he ruled in the North, with its dial-plate and pale jest, \" We shall die-all,\" indi cated the select court ; and the shield bearing a monkey, and stars in chief, pointed out the lofty house of Viscount Stair, whose daughter Janet was the saddest heroine of Scottish story. The term \" Mahogany Land,\" grafted on a neighbouring wooden structure, implied that it was one of those piles so quaint and so costly that the designation of the rare and valuable West Indian wood had been applied to them. At a later period, when trade and custom had begun to flow west, poetry and art still loved this quarter, and Burns, Camp bell, Scott, Runciman, and Wilkie, lent it the lights and shades of their fame. About 1700 it was as"], [20, "6 The Diamond Rose. full of dormer windows, protruding gables, sudden towers and peaks, crow steps, outer stairs to first storey galleries, and masses of tall chimneys, like giants beside squat dwarfs of frail booths, as any Elemish or German relic by green oozing canal, or purple vine-festooned river. Some corners of the district were already dusky with age, and many as rich in story as they ever will be : \u2014 the Grey friars, the royal residence of princes when it was yet a monastery, and the haunt of patriots and martyrs when it became a free, stern, devoted kirk ; the West Port, with bullet ornaments of fleshless skulls \u2014 now of Royalist, now of Cove nanter \u2014 where sovereigns were hailed and coTi querors cheered ; Bristo Port, where men and women stood in the pillory, had their ears nailed to a board, and were branded on the cheeks occa sionally for no greater offence than harbouring the pest-smitten ; and the Grass-market, whose gallows was more associated in the people's minds with the prayers and hymns of the faithful than the groans of crime. If Bristo Street was next to the dark old Bow"], [21, "Lady Somerville s Hospital. 7 itself for picturesqueness, the house of Lady Somer ville's maidens was a fair specimen of its architec ture. It was an old mansion which had been trans formed to suit its present charitable purpose; and happily what was best in its old style had been dovetailed into its new. The low arched entrance bore one of those pious inscriptions so common in devout old Edinburgh that they crowned the very closes; and the most universal of all the prayers and thanksgivings inscribed in enduring, begrimed stone letters \u2014 \"Blissed be God for all his gyftis\" \u2014 was surely peculiarly appropriate to a charitable foundation. The old hall \u2014 on whose ceiling Lady Somerville had caused Norrie to paint in colours, not one of his landscapes, but the arms of the Somervilles, and this rather out of affectionate re spect to her husband's memory than from family pride and partiality \u2014 proved an excellent charter room, gymnasium, refectory, and chapel for the fifteen girls. And the terraced garden and bowl ing-green \u2014 almost as shady and delightful as the gardens of what strangers called the palaces of the Earls of Moray and Panmure,- the Dukes"], [22, "The Diamond Rose. 8 of Roxburghe and Qucensberry, down yonder in the Canongate, under the wing of Holyrood \u2014 formed a boon which many a city boarding-school in later days might covet, and afforded an ample field for the health and recreation of the inmates. There Lady Somerville's maidens dwelt under formal discipline. Drawn out in files they marched to bed, to prayer, to study, and even to play. And, ah me ! there was never a spoilt darling amongst them, never a mother's pet except on visiting days, never a privileged loiterer or merry trifler ; all was in order, according to rule, precise, unrelaxing, and unchangeable. And Scotch bairns were bairns in Queen Anne's days as in Victoria's ; and nature's genial, fertile, exhaustless variety of feature, complexion, and expression, mocked their uniform \u2014 queer even at that time, \u2014 mocked their stuff petticoats, white tippets, and mob caps. How would her ladyship's single-hearted plan \u2014 not tried upon the strength, hardihood, and inde pendence of boyhood, but upon girlish suscepti bility, delicacy, and dependence, answer its end ? How do all generalisations of the kind result ?"], [23, "Lady Somerville s Hospital. 9 In the weal of some and the hurt of others, but inevitably in the gain of the honest heart which directs them, and the honest heart which suffers them \u2014 though not in the way each individual heart fondly dreams."], [24, "10 II. LIFE IN THE BRISTO-STREET HOME. \"\\T 7TTHOUT were the tumults and reactions of a convulsed era, which, settling down in the core of Church and State, had reduced it to a low and somewhat stagnant level ; while on the surface there was the luxuriant, artificial, un wholesome brilliancy of glorious victories, without end or aim. Shrewd, time-serving, acquisitive states men were then falsely elevated into a country's heroes: there was polish without refinement, manners without morals; and men's minds were fervid about schemes and manias, Darien expedi tions and China closets, with occasional outbreaks of the old fierce hostilities, such as the massacre of Glencoe, which had sickened the gray-beards."], [25, "Life in the Bristo-street Home. 11 or the Porteous mob, which was to confound the blooming youth. Within the Hospital in Bristo Street the fifteen girls were growing up demurely or defiantly into staid or giddy women. There was little modera tion in them. The thoughtful and gracious were very grave and resolute after all their apprentice ship to order, activity, and perseverance; but the light-minded were hypocritical or reckless, as the scales of sin might turn, and all the more con firmed in their selfishness, self-indulgence, and denial of responsibility and obligation, because they had been compelled for seven years to be outwardly painstaking, proper, and punctual. At the head of the Hospital, at this season, was a matron on whom Janet Lady Somerville set great store. She was a Janet too, or Jonet, as the old fashioned, rigid, and very notable title was then sometimes Scotticised. She was termed Mrs. Jonet all throughout the Hospital, except upon the books. Mrs. Jonet was what at that time was con sidered plainly cut out for her situation. She B"], [26, "The Diamond Rose. 12 was neither winning nor sympathetic \u2014 merely upright, attentive, and firm. But if you were to travel to the ends of the earth, it is probable that you would feel inclined to give the preference to the qualities which Mrs. Primrose adjudged to the stout, sober silks in the choice of her wedding gown. Mrs. Jonet's face, though finely cut, was not beautiful with the ripe, placid beauty of middle age. It was too sharp, and meagre, and colourless ; though it might be picturesque, under its Queen Anne's hood. She was gently born in her own right, as well as a woman in authority. Like Lady Somerville, she was a strict Presbyterian, and in her youth had been a stanch and indefatigable attender at the conventicles. She had hung her kerchief from her window as a signal to proscribed Whigs \u2014 had carried food and drink to outlaws and fugi tives in the double receptacle cunningly inserted beneath her ostentatious, capacious upper pocket had entertained thoughts of emigrating to the Indies or America \u2014 and had even stood wrathful and austere, rising above woman's pity and woman's"], [27, "Life in the Bristo-street Home. 13 weakness, in the Grass-market. And she had sat at her window approving and applauding when the mob \"rabbled\" out Episcopal clergymen from their benefices, and plundered and destroyed their household goods. Mrs. Jonet possessed some of the virtues of the wise woman of Proverbs; but she wanted others. On her lips was the law of truth, but not ordinarily that of kindness. She looked well to the ways of her household, and ate not the bread of idleness ; but the circle of the poor to which she stretched out her hand was very limited \u2014 old servants, forlorn professors, pinched gentlewomen, helpless infants. The outer rings of that great, weltering sea of misery which surrounds us all, consisted of va grants and vagabonds who deserved no counten ance from Mrs. Jonet. Then certainly she could never have been compared to a merchant's ship, bringing her food from afar, for she had no originality, and undervalued invention. Instead of considering a field, or planting a vineyard, she eschewed worldly prosperity and superfluity, and clung to being useful on bare necessaries. She"], [28, "The Diamond Rose. 14 would have equally recoiled from clothing hei household with scarlet, and from making to herself coverings of tapestry, silk, and purple \u2014 for that would have been sheer vanity and wantonness in her jealous eyes. Indeed, though she would have been furious at the charge of Papistry, she inclined to the black garments of Lent and the sackcloth of Ash Wednesday. In her hood, mantle, and mittens, Mrs. Jonet was perpetually perambulating the wide stairs, the low corridors, the little sleeping-cells. She hovered over the steam of the porridge and the kail, heard the halting catechisms, and darted out upon the greensward into the centre of the cliques, the games, the scandals, the confidences. There could have been no question about Mrs. Jonet's vigilance ; and the faithful, and pious-minded, and sweet tempered respected her, while the forward and malcontent hated her. Almost none loved her; but in Queen Anne's reign the mistress of a hospital was not meant to be loved, as we think of love or fondness. Of Lady Somerville's maidens who had been"], [29, "Life in the Bristo-street Home. 15 born before Malplaquet, and lived long after \" the fifteen,\" two were strong types of opposite classes, though alike in this, that they came of well born but very ill off families, who held a monopoly of city patronage. Euphame Napier's widow mother was a pensioner in Trinity Hospital, while she had a cousin in George Heriot's palace, where Katie Crichton's brother, Mark, was a companion boy Occasionally Lady Somerville's maidens, in their tippets and caps, passed their male relations in the long coats and coarse hose of the munificent goldsmith's fraternity. Indeed Adie Napier would nod to Euphame under the penalty of bodily punishment; and Mark Crichton would walk on, stalwart, impassive for his years, setting Euphame to conjecture, in the first place, whether this was a distinct specimen of the Crichton race, and, in the second, whether she would not like him better than Katie. Katie Crichton was not singularly bad, she was only incorrigibly idle, pleasure-loving, and wilful. No mere tasks could root out the original sin, any more than the stuff gown could transform the"], [30, "The Diamond Rose. 16 slender, supple figure into a stout, stiff body; 01 the mob cap make a plain, sensible face out of the pretty, volatile, unimpressionable features, or put wisdom into the head crowned by the black silky hair, combed back and hidden just now, but frizzed, and curled, and flung abroad every half holiday when Katie escaped to the company of her mother and sisters, in the lodgings which Mrs. Crichton kept for quality in the High Street. Euphame Napier, on the other hand, was a big girl for her thirteen years, and her face was at this time too heavy and florid for clearness or correct ness of tint or outline ; but already there was re markable repose and power in the full but straight mouth, in the deep gray eyes, and in the broad brow. It was a very womanly face, and at the same time one to depend upon. Perhaps the Duke of Argyle's \"sonsy lass,\" Jeanie Deans, resembled her; for the face was a quiet, modest face, through all its expressions. Euphame was clear as crystal, candid, sensible, brave, loving, and pious, as such a nature is prone to be even in ignorance. But, notwithstanding, she"], [31, "Life in the Bristo-street Home. 17 was self-concentrated, withdrawn from her neigh bours, and obstinate. She was very diligent, very obedient to Mrs. Jonet, \u2014 and this not because she feared punishment, but because she was grateful, loved order, was fond of occupation, and had a grand indifference to pleasure. Not that the girl was a Stoic either \u2014 she had a wonderful capacity for pleasure in simple things, but her narrow studies, her limited observations, her dawning associations were sufficient food for a healthful opening mind like hers. True, Euphame had only one strong cord to her heart-strings, and that was her love for her poor, contented old mother in the Trinity \u2014 for Euphame was an only child, and her mother was a widow; but that cord was such a cable in a disposition like Euphame's, that knowing no other she wanted no other. Though Euphame and Katie bore no bond of sisterhood between them, they were now and then thrown together, and marked out in a sort of association. They were of an age, \u2014 womanly little maidens of thirteen, \u2014 and they were as well born as"], [32, "18 The Diamond Rose. any gentlewoman under Lady Somerville's protec tion. Crichton was a good name in the south of Scotland ; and as for Euphame Napier, she was able to look across the Burgh Muir to the setting sun gleaming in rays of gold on the im posing mass of irregular buildings, crowded with suggestive coats of arms, mottoes, and distiches, which all bore testimony to the state and influence of this branch of the Napiers, as Merchiston Castle did to that greener stem. And yet poor Euphame was being educated by charity, and her mother was no better than a bedeswoman in the Trinity ; while Katie Crichton's brother received alms from the shade of George Heriot. Indeed, many of the girls and young women had well-to-do con nexions and comfortable homes, and only played upon Lady Somerville's bounty, in order to secure the education, the geography and the dancing, (for there was dancing in the douce town, though the magistrates and ministers only permitted it to be taught by licensed professors,) which distinguished it from a dame's school, and which was rare in Queen Anne's reign. In"], [33, "Life in the Bristo-st7xet Home. 19 Scotland the love of learning survived the dreary dissipation and frivolity of the second Charles's lustre, and the religious troubles excited thought and stimulated genius. Lady Kenmure, to whom Samuel Rutherford addressed his letters, was no illiterate woman; Grizel Baillie sang sweetly on her hill-side perch; and at no very distant date, Lady Wardlaw of Pitreavie executed such an imitation of the heroic march of a ballad of the sea-border as might have laid the dark spirit in the burdened breast of a warlike Saul. But the interlopers for the sake of the loaves and fishes of knowledge in Lady Somerville's Hospital did not hesitate to shed their wit on the more honest recipients; they scorned the poverty-stricken pensioners; they viewed with contempt their debt to other chari ties; and without any particular acquaintance with the history of the knights of St. John, they would dub Euphame Napier and Katie Crichton hos pitallers, in contradistinction to themselves, who, though they wore Lady Somerville's badge, could drop it any day so far as food and raiment were concerned. How often are old and young, with"], [34, "The Diamond Rose. 20 no primitive inclination, forced into communica tions and circumstances for which they can scarcely account, which they cannot shake off, and which come to influence their whole lives deeply and seriously. Looking back, and tracing the first almost compulsory beginning of the association, the faithless call it fate, and the faithful provi dence. Morning after morning, for half a score years, Lady Somerville's maidens were aroused in the sunny summer dawn and the bleak winter's dark ness by the warning bell ; and, rising from their hard pallets, they washed, dressed cxpeditiously at their tiny looking-glasses, and met at the early exercises in the hall, where the sole license of the day was allowed to the chaplain. Mr. Durie (a fragrant name in old covenanting Edinburgh ears) might hold forth at will \u2014 time was not dribbled out, or autocratically allotted to him. The porridge might be scalding, or the message boy tirling at the pin, but no quiver of impatience disturbed Mrs. Jonet's fixed features and folded hands; and no sleepy, hungry girl might yawn at"], [35, "Life in the Bristo-street Home. 21 her peril. But Mr. Durie was generally merciful as well as earnest ; and there was something touching and significant in this loyal homage to spiritual duties and needs, which was shown in the intentness and care with which the thoughtful among the maidens set their soft, dimpled faces, and folded their hands like Mrs. Jonet, and la boured to feel in a devout frame of mind, to hate the world, and mortify the flesh. Afterwards Mr. Durie said grace, and returned thanks for the bowls of porridge and the porringers of milk. Then he heard the girls read and re peat portions of geography and history, and pre sided over maps, copies, and slates \u2014 subsiding marvellously from a serious, solemn divine into quite a simple, abstracted dominie, upon whom, when Mrs. Jonet's back was turned, the waggish among his pupils, and even graver girls like Eu phame, played little ludicrous tricks, in all affection and respect. A half-cracked little Frenchman came in and instructed them in English country-dances and French minuets, and Mrs. Jonet was always present then, though she looked as if she could"], [36, "Tsic Diamond Rose. 22 have snapped up both violinist and violin. The rest of the day was generally devoted to the elaborate embroidery, which occupied the place of the languages and dash of science in modern polite accomplishments, and the sale of which assisted the funds of the Hospital ; to lessons in cookery, and airings in the garden, and errands into the town under particular stipulations and restrictions. Then came the evening catechism and diet of worship, the early retirement to rest, and the sinking down of profound silence on the old house in Bristo Street, which had once con tained its rough-riders and its gay ladies, its pert waiting-women and boisterous serving-men. Why, they were like nuns, these Somerville mai dens, say you? Nay, they were free \u2014 they were training, wisely or unwisely, for work and warfare and life in the world."], [37, "-j ) III. A CONTRAST AND A HARDSHIP. \"X T OW, see the girls at their embroidery frames. The two selected for notice, Euphame and Katie, sit side by side. Katie is always losing her needle, entangling her silks, or yawning, whispering, and humming snatches of \" Robin's testament,\" \" A mousie sat on yon mill pin,\" or \" Waly, waly, by yon bank,\" all in the same voice; while Eu phame creates her faint roses with real artistic satisfaction, and, scarcely looking up for an hour's time, recalls the text about the rose of Sharon, which Mr. Durie had quoted as he passed behind the bench, \u2014 wondering if the balm of Gilead was the same as the balm on their terrace, and whether the cedars of Lebanon were greater than their larch-tree, a shoot, as Lady Somerville"], [38, "The Diamond Rose. 24 averred, from one of Queen Mary's larches which she brought over from France in a flower-pot. Here Katie surreptitiously begins munching at fragments of sweet cake and comfits, with which her mother had stuffed her pockets the last time she ran up to the High Street. Euphame glances at her with supreme disdain. Bristo Street is drearily dull to Katie Crichton; but there is some thing that excites disgust in the greed with which she expatiates on the sweetmeats. \" Euphame Napier,\" whispers Katie Crichton, \"I saw a puggy in the Bow yesterday.

Then she added briskly, \"I doubt you're no very humble, Euphame. I think you mean to be a saint.\" \"And if I do, is that an ill wish, Katie?

Fortunately her attention was soon diverted by Katie, who whispered impressively, almost before Mrs. Jonet was beyond hearing \u2014 \" What made you tell, Euphame ?

In one of the tiny cells, like a figure in a niche, or like the blandest and most respectable of old women in blue coat and kirtle, sat Mrs. Napier spinning. In this convent world \u2014 for Mary of Gueldres' insti tution retained to the last much of the stillness and dimness of the cloister \u2014 the widow of the aristocratically descended, liberal, hospitable Edin burgh merchant drew out the lapsing thread of her life. She had seen the day when she was prosper ous, gay, and beloved, and now she was content to be one of the dependent, submissive, buried pen sioners of the Trinity, in order that her dear Eu phame might be cared for, and kept in the way of acquiring an honourable and comfortable livelihood, besides being trained in piety and godliness. She was content; and what a commentary that was on the woman ! on her frank equanimity, her sweet"], [47, "An Old Dame of the Trinity. 33 endurance, her Christian faith and charity! She was neither a wise nor a strong woman. Euphame took a very moderate portion of her qualities from her mother; who was as loveable as foolish old Lear. Not having swayed a sceptre, she did not stand on her dignity, or insist on her hundred knights; but she had the old king's impulsive, un reasonable fits of wrath and indignation, alternating with a lavishly kind and indulgent temper. She had not been a prudent woman in saving her husband's income ; she was for ever worsted in her encounters with worldly neighbours; she was susceptible of lively prejudices and partialities; and, like many another old lady, was comically honest and wicked in her enjoyment of a little gossip and scandal. But ah! her wickedness was made up purely of curiosity and experience, and a spice of conceit in her own penetration and judgment, of which, though she was a quick old lady, she had little or none. She contradicted earnestly, and with perfect sin cerity, the cynical views of to-day in the benevo lence of to-morrow ; and in her most satirical and severe moods she would have so pitied her ne;gh-"], [48, "The Diamond Rose. 34 bours in any unlooked-for misfortune, that she would have feasted them with her fatted calf. Mrs. Napier would have been invaluable in a besieged fort. As long as self-denial and bodily fatigue were needed, the old woman would have stood in the breach; and if she would have thus pleased, comforted, and relieved the world at large, what would she not have done for Euphame, who was the very apple of her eye ! The thought of Euphame was sufficient to gladden her dullest day; and when she was able to get a good bit of news, or manufacture some little comfort, or procure some little delicacy, and have it put by her, all ready for Euphame's next visit, she was as happy as when she filled the \"land\" or tenement in the Canongate, and stood behind the parapet of her own roof to witness the city shows ; or as when she presided at substantial burghers' suppers, graced by a knight or a nobleman on occasion, and was waited on by her serving-women and her husband's apprentices.

Mrs. Napier quivers, and flushes, and sparkles like a young beauty with joy, and looks Euphame all over, and feels and pats her as if she were blind. She then presents her with the warm hose she had just knitted, and the lace neckerchief she has had given her by one of the other old ladies whom she has nursed through her third spring sickness. She accepts with delight Euphame's flowers \u2014 her daffodils and pinks \u2014 and points out her last Wednesday's flowers still pre served, but now to be superseded. She must hear every particular of the last week, though it be the very same as the one that went before; and then she tells her own little stories \u2014 how the governor was cross to Mr. Mair, because he always stayed out beyond his time ; how Mrs. Guthrie was allowed to keep a cat, because a great rat had gnawed its way through the corner under her bed ; and how Mrs. Christine could not sleep, because she main tained that the cat might fly through the closed doors into her room, and steal up to her breast, and sit there and suck her sleeping breath away. And"], [50, "The Diamond Rose. 36 then after a little pause for breath-taking she would tell how Mrs. Christine had told her such a story of Mrs. Guthrie's half-sister, who came in her chair sometimes to the hospital \u2014 how she had sold her yellow hair to the periwig makers, to pay the charges of her \"whims,\" and \"follies,\" and \"treats\" at Mutrie's Hill and Broughton, and persuaded the advocate that her locks were caught in the flame of a sconce, and scorched at one side, so that she had to clip the other short to make them equal \u2014 a racketing, deceitful quean! The advocate supped sorrow with his marrow. \"But I saw the lady a week syne, riding down Bristo Street, with her long curls waving over her jacket,\" asserts the accurate Euphame. Mrs. Napier suggests that the lady may have adopted one of the periwigs, to whose raw material she had contributed, or that Euphame may have seen her before the deed; and when Euphame is resolute, Mrs. Napier gets warm and cries that bairns are always wiser than their elders, and that from the days in which she has seen evil, her eyesight alone may be trusted to detect a giddy pate and a"], [51, "An Old Dame of the Trinity. 37 waster. But Euphame has only to say, \"Mother, I did not mean to vex you,\" and the huff is gone, and the old lady is as cheery as ever, and describes how Adie Napier had smuggled his torn holiday suit to her, and how Mark Crichton had carried the parcel, and been in trouble for it. Adie was vexed because Mark had withheld an explanation, and it was too late for Adie to dissipate the mystery. \" It was wrong in Adie and in Mark Crichton, too,\" judged Euphame. \"May be, my dear, I might be the furthest wrong of the three. Na, I admit it, Euphame. I'm weak, I downa be hard to young folk ; but you've never tempted me, my daughter.\" \"You're ower guid to me, mother.\" Then, she added after a pause \u2014 \"Katie Crichton says Mark is not good company at home.\" See what inveterate gossips we are, when even Euphame takes her turn at it! But what is gossip? Where does the wholesome check of public opinion end, and the lash of detraction and calumny begin ? \"She's bold to say it, Euphame.

I've no patience with that wife, Euphame \u2014 to spoil her idle lasses might be forgiven her, but to sorn on her lad! Adie found it out ; ne'er a word did Mark speak of it to Adie; he's a close chield, and a thocht sour, but he's manful.\" \"He's eydent, mother, but he's harsh, they say. What right has he to be proud and stern, when man and woman, fervent and slothful, are alike sinners?\" \"Never speer the right, bairn, but deplore the fact; for poor Mark Crichton's heart will never be lighter than it should be, in these the days of his youth.\" \"Mother,\" observed Euphame, escaping to a more satisfactory topic, \"in four years, if the Lord spare me, I will be seventeen, and will be fit for work."], [53, "An Old Dame of the Trinity. 39 I think Lady Somerville will recommend me to a place; and I will be very steady and save my fee, and it will soon gather, until it be sufficient to take up house with.

I wish your poor father may be permitted to look down upon us, Euphame,\" concluded Mrs. Napier, wistfully. Afterwards she joked about spinning their plenishing, for her old lily-white sheets and blankets, which she had spun as a bride, were lost in the dispersion of their property long ago. Yet all the time the simple old woman knew right well that she would never live to see the end of these four years. She was conscious of sailing strength. She had not been very foreseeing in the course of her life, but she anticipated its close. \"But Euphame will be a stately woman, a braw, bonnie cummer, though I'm no here to see her.

' I \"\"HE stroke had fallen \u2014 a greater stroke to Euphame than the events of war, vicissi- tudes of politics, strategies, plots, blunders, and literary enterprises, which march so brilliantly across the field of Anne's reign. The old mother in the Trinity was gone from this world, and although Euphame was a girl of much promise, and had made a lively impression on her friends and acquaintances, she was nobody's darling now ; she had no longer any beloved figure hovering constantly in her mind's eye. She had struggled through the rebellion of yearning affection, the chill of lonely orphanhood ; she was strong, and fsarless, and faithful again ; but her heart, it"], [56, "The Diamond Rose. 42 must be confessed, was a little harder when the wound which bled so profusely had cicatrized. It should not be so. Misfortune should soften, not steel ; but it is the dangerous tendency of that composed, calm, unworldly spirit, when its living outlet is for ever closed, not to forget or forsake its Maker, but to draw off more and more from its fellows, and to give warnings of a gradual harden ing to the common joys and sorrows, troubles and cares of humanity. The sufferer is an excellent man or woman, but above ordinary wants and weaknesses \u2014 a little cold, a little high-minded, and, with all his or her meekness, there is a suspicion of superciliousness lurking beneath the charity.

But Euphame was much esteemed in the Hos pital. In her seventeenth year she was as staid, and true, and kind a maiden as had ever worn its laurels. In this her closing season, she was em ployed in many offices of trust and responsibility, notwithstanding that Mrs. Jonet had never been known to devolve any special duty upon another. One honourable distinction awarded to Euphame was that, on the completion of a masterpiece of embroidery, she was despatched, under the plaid, which fell prettily over her head and shoulders compared with the ordinary garniture of cap and tippet, to display the performance to their foun dress, Lady Somerville. She had been seen and noticed by Lady Somerville frequently, and had gone occasionally to her house in the Queen's Close, but never by herself, or on a specially indi vidual mission. Euphame, in her grave way, liked the progress through the streets, and the ideas which were sug gested to her \u2014 up the clattering, dark Bow, safe, D"], [58, "The Diamond Rose. 44 and only safe, in broad sunshine. A thrill passed through her as she crossed before the high, black browed house where the burgher's wife saw the gigantic woman join her comrades, heard the im measurable laughter, watched the wildly-waving torches, and asked next day, when she had re covered from her trance of terror, who lived in that mansion, and was answered, Major Weir. In Euphame's day, the black staff which \"suffered\" with its owner was still said to tap up and down the disused stairs, and attend as a porter at the closed doors, while the wretched Grizel Weir's wheel was heard to hum within the untenanted house, and unhallowed lights lit up its darkness. Euphame was not before her time \u2014 she was not very superstitious, but she was not incredulous ; and Mrs. Jonet as implicitly believed in \" Satan's Kingdom Unmasked,\" as in \" Peden's Prophecies.\" There Euphame was scared a second time. A Highlander in his dusky tartan and nodding plumes brushed past her.

The city guard, enrolled for the peace and protection of the lieges, was notoriously fierce ; and a Macdiarmid or Macdonald, fresh from his awful haunts, what was to be expected of him ? Remember, it was after this that Lord Lovat's Highlanders marched into Edinburgh, surrounded a citizen's dwelling house, and carried off, upon the warrant of their chief's instructions, to that \" rock in the ocean,\" lone St. Kilda, the raving, foaming daughter of Chiesly of Dairy, and wife of Lord Grange. Eu phame Napier had some grounds for her palpita tion, though she rebuked herself immediately on the rational ground \u2014 \" What would a wild John High landman want with a poor body like me ? How could I provoke him ?\" And she might have spared a portion of her dread and aversion for the gallants, three deep, ruffling along the street. But the gallants were customary nuisances ; and Euphame, by her quiet, pure, unflinching face, disarmed their ogling and swaggering, and almost induced some bold but not shameless eyes to sink abashed."], [60, "46 The Diamond Rose. Euphame was in the High Street \u2014 the pride of the old metropolis \u2014 passing rich in its buildings and adornments. There was the black, stanchioned, orim Tolbooth ; beloved St. Giles's, fresh from one of its many last touches, and fair in shaft, arch, and keystone, where, in the Old Kirk above, Jenny Geddes arrested the astounded Dean, and in the vault below, the dust of Euphame's ancestors, the Napiers of the Wrichtishouse, mingled in loving communion with that of the Napiers of Merchiston ; while above were the cross and its unicorn, where Montrose and the Argyles met the same violent death, and further on the tall houses with their terraced pleasure-gardens running down to the Nor' Loch, on whose waters citizens boated on the summer evenings, and across whose ford fugi tives fled red-handed, \u2014 all ending in the frowning Castle, with its grand hill.

Adie Napier was no longer among them. His time was expired ; and in the license of his liberty, poor Adie had plunged headlong into reckless courses, and, without friends or money, had enlisted as a soldier, almost before he had time to look about him and bethink himself, and settle on a sober footing. And so it seemed that poor Adie's careful education had proved worse than useless, and that he had been very far from respecting the wise, liberal, large-hearted goldsmith's aim. But here was Mark Crichton still among the foremost boys with broadening chest and towering head. Euphame had her old slight acquaintance with him, and her old impression of him. She knew he was a diligent lad, and likely to be an indefatigable man, though of a somewhat hard and bitter con sistency. Euphame did not of course consider that she herself was cold and spotless \u2014 \"as snow on Rona's crest.\" She had not the coveted faculty which we all need so .much \u2014 \" To see oursel's as ithers see us.\""], [62, "48 The Diamond Rose. The High Street was already much given over to traffic. The gentle names of ancient proprietors were beginning to hover like ghosts over ware rooms and public offices ; but conspicuous then as now, just where the Netherbow and the High Street exchange greetings, stood the house of Master John Knox, where the magistrates pre sented him with his private study, \" built of daillis,\" from whence he addressed the crowd from the broad window. Euphame gazed at it lovingly ; and though, owing to her still nature, she was not much given to such reflections, she thought of Marjorie Bowes of Berwick, and how the Re former asked her whether she could aid him to bear his heavy burden, and how she engaged to shift the weight from his broad shoulders to her slight back on a certain occasion. Euphame counted her favoured that she was literally enabled to carry the fainting traveller's baggage for him in one day's weary trudge in the Low Countries. At last Euphame was in the Canongate, whose \"lands\" were still the pride and pleasure of all the families of degree and substance who had not"], [63, "A Walk through the Old Town. 49 migrated at the Union. At the head of the Canon gate was the sign of the White Horse, kept sixty years later by Lucky Boyd, and whence there issued, late on a hot Saturday night in August, the important note, which imparted such gratifica tion to the conceited, enthusiastic receiver: \"Mr. Johnson sends his compliments to Mr. Boswell, being just arrived at Boyd's.\" And straight before Euphame lay the noble quadrangle and the towers of Holyrood, where John Knox rebuked Mary in vain, till the \" sweet face,\" which all men had bidden \"God save!\" when she came home to her rough, tumultuous Scots, was all disfigured with wounded pride and angry vexation, and, alas ! anything but honest conviction and brave re pentance. Within another stone's throw was the Queen's Close, which some dowager Margaret or Mary had honoured as a temporary residence, or where she had thought fit to drop the shackles of state and ceremony in visiting a chosen waiting-woman or an attached court adherent, and so had bequeathed the name of the locality, all the same as if she had"], [64, "The Diamond Rose. 50 planted her body and train within its limits.

She had her ivory-headed stick for use, because she was stiff from feebleness and sick ness rather than from age. She had stood alone in her family. Moreover, she had been of a meek spirit, and had been overwhelmed by some of the deep spiritual researches of her guides. What tortures she had undergone, and how much arro gance was left in her, her drooping figure and downcast face were there to tell.

While far more settled and resolute in principle than most girls of her age, she was at a time of life when the character is still very plastic, and liable to receive strong biases to domestic or social interests. A good, pure, sober-minded woman like Euphame, with the blessed seal of godliness on her soul, enthusiastic, but not with a frothy enthusiasm, could scarcely in her tender youth adopt a gener ous plan like this, and pursue far off in the distance a benevolent result, without great advantage to her own growth in single-heartedness, peace, and hea venly-mindedness.

The neighbouring windows were still much in request, though the Assembly was a place of less stirring interest now than in former years ; and Mrs. Jonet, who went rarely abroad on pleasure, and might be said only to attend the kirk on Sabbath-day, and the diets of examination on Thursday mornings, came expressly to her friend Mrs. Lilias Campbell's, and from the win-"], [85, "An Old Gathering. 71 dows of her room above the hosiery shop viewed the leaders of her cause.

Nothing cared Mrs. Jonet for the Lord High Commissioner, his coach, his guards, his gentle men, his footmen and coachmen, with their powder, their cocked hats, and their nosegays, nearly the solitary remaining specimens of the magnificent costumes contemporary with Queen Anne. What to her was my lord, whether Annandale, Glasgow, or Atholl, but a vain representative of majesty, whom she was strongly tempted to suspect of tampering with the perfect freedom of her Kirk? Yet, apart from religious matters, Mrs. Jonet, like most women of her rank in that day, was highly and stiffly aris tocratic, and her friendships by no means disproved the fact. Mrs. Lilias Campbell was a spinster of many descents, and of a distinguished coat of arms, though her tocher and its interest only furnished her aumrie with oatmeal, salt pork, and herrings except on state occasions.

Old Edinburgh was not without its visions of fresh feathery twigs, pure lily cups, and purple buds of coming lilac. Though public gardens as yet were not, the old city gates opened abruptly upon country suburbs and country fields pressing close to its walls; and its private gardens were so extensive and so generally appre ciated that they were allowed to become in a measure the people's property, so that my Lady Murray's garden was as well-favoured an assigna tion as the King's Park or the Duke's Walk.

Still, Mrs. Crichton was so unsettled and inconsiderate in word and action, that there was no reason to suppose she would not comply with Mrs. Jonet's demand, the moment her hand reached the culprits. Mrs. Jonet hesi tated to apprise Lady Somerville. She was not a merciful woman, but she loved that fine fragile body and spirit ; she grieved to discompose and distress her whom she was almost ostentatious in styling 'mistress,' and she was fain to be excused from giving a bad account of her stewardship ; and stern as she was, an immediate accusation, without room for intervening rebuke and repentance, did seem disproportioned to the offence.

Slipping away one early morning, he reached the broomy braes of Teith, and plunged anew, with exultation, into his fastnesses. He took with him only his skene-dhu, leaving the insignia of his corps, lest it should cumber and betray him. Indeed, with a slight infraction of the laws of pro perty, pardonable in a mountaineer, he had be queathed his trusty axe to his kinswoman Bawby, left alone among the hostile Southern.

The little band had only made their way as far as the head of the Bow, when they were wedged into the hindmost ranks, and stopped in their pro gress. At the Bow Head was a wide space, where stood the Butter Tron, or Weigh-house, where agri cultural produce was tested ; and here many of the idlers and bullies, and dangerous, determined men, spread out and rested themselves until room was made in front, or a reason afforded for their assem blage, and an aim suggested on which to expend their spare energy. Fortunately for Mrs. Jonet and her company, this termination of the many-headed monster con sisted principally of what might be called the rustic tribes of the city, \u2014 the cowfeeders, labourers, and quarrymen, from Coates, Dairy, Pocket Sleeve, and High Riggs, who, scenting uproar, had flocked"], [109, "A Night-search and what it led to. 95 into the town before Bristo Port was closed, and who might be rude and brutal, but not so demo ralised as the population of the low wynds and alleys. Worsted bonnets, mauds or long coats, and stout sticks, styled rungs, marked the mass, and when Mrs. Jonet and her satellites moved for ward, they heard these men growl forth their resentment at some wretched representatives of levity and luxury. They would not have been so swiftly calmed and appeased by any bribe as by the sight which then sometimes greeted the Edin burgh congregations on retiring from church \u2014 that of a woman given to drunkenness, cursing, or evil company, standing in the jougs \" from the ringing of the second bell until the close of the last.\" In deed the mob of the Bow was already clamouring for some object of their wrath being borne \" To the jougs.\" As the beams of the Weigh-house afforded a fair board for the pillory, the jougs, those ugly iron rings, were usually kept beside them, ready for use also.

Her plaid had fallen down, and her bare head, and young, unabashed, pitiful girl's face were fully ex posed. \"Oh! hold down your hands, men. Let Katie and Alison go. I'm sure they're very sorry.

Adie was permitted by his officer to detach one or two of his companions (much to the scorn of Highland Bawby) to form an escort for the maltreated maidens and their principals, and re lodge them safely within their hospital in Bristo Street."], [116, "102 IX.

Quite the contrary. Mr. Durie said nothing. Even he had a misgiving that if a young maiden ought to be silent before her elders, it was not easily explicable or defensible in young Euphame Napier to have taken it upon her to utter the plainest and most uncompromising remonstrance to"], [117, "Unexpected Changes. 103 a crowd of prejudiced and furious men, and to have succeeded where he and Mrs. Jonet had failed. Mrs. Jonet fairly scolded her \u2014 \" What tempted you to put yoursel' forward, Euphame Napier? What call had a bairn like you to speak out?

In ordi nary circumstances we have seen that she stood aside, and built up her cloud-castles, and looked down serenely on the swarm toiling and moiling at her feet ; but there was never a season of peculiar difficulty, never an hour of especial peril, but it was laid upon Euphame to come swiftly forward and undertake the obligation.

Katie Crichton cried and sobbed all the way home. It was to be supposed that, exercised by so much lamentation, she would be in a mood to make amends on the morrow, to crave forgive ness, to offer to bear any humiliation, and to pro mise better conduct for the future; but, to the consternation of the whole hospital, Katie arose from her bed perfectly defiant. She cared for none of their judgments \u2014 she would not stay another day in her prison \u2014 she would not wait to hear Lady Somerville's wishes. She had sent word to Mark, who had come home from George Heriot's and a week before had been apprenticed to Paul Romieu, the foreign clockmaker, to appear and claim her, and remove her to her mother's. Alison Hughes was brought down, and sat softened, shaken, and sombre, not supporting her associate. Mrs. Jonet sentenced Katie over and over again, and tried to talk her down. Mr. Durie came in his black coat and Geneva bands, and tried to"], [119, "Unexpected Changes. 105 exorcise the spirit that possessed the girl. Eu phame, with her wise, wide-reaching obedience and humanity, reproved her, but totally without effect. It was the worm turning after it had been trampled upon, the weak creature goaded and stung into such reckless violence as the strong rarely display. \" Ye needna flyte on me, Mrs. Jonet \u2014 ye needna preach to me, Mr. Durie \u2014 ye needna wonder at me, Euphame Napier \u2014 ye've done little for me.

Lady Somerville did not possess the power of holding her maidens in"], [121, "Unexpected Changes. 107 the hospital against their will, when their natural guardians consented to their withdrawal, and in this case Mark Crichton, in the name of his mother, approved of Katie's determination. It sounded so senseless and ungrateful, but Mark persisted that the hospital was not the place for Katie, and had never been calculated to promote her welfare. It might answer with some natures, he could not tell ; but it was not fitted for Katie. He did not de fend her disobedience or her railing; but he was there to remove his sister to where she would not trouble Lady Somerville any more. Mr. Durie reproved the headstrong irreverent lad. Mrs. Jonet animadverted on the pride that would have a fall, and the lust of the eye and the lust of the flesh, that led to judgment. Mark stood sullen and unconvinced. Euphame tried him with her clear, earnest protest \u2014 the protest of an equal in years, a cousin of Adie Napier's, an old com panion of Katie's. \" Mark Crichton, I cannot fathom the spirit ye are of.

Euphame entered on some household task, looked and lin gered, and then walked up to Mrs. Jonet's side : \"Mrs. Jonet, you were no to blame; you looked after us with all your might; you could not ken how manifold were our wants, even if permitted to minister to them.\" \" Did I complain, bairn ?

I warn you, Euphame Napier.\" \"But your reward is not here, Mrs. Jonet; and, would you only mind that some saw your faithful ness, and counted that they were indebted to it, and longed to pour their testimony in your ears?\" Mrs. Jonet did not respond; she was gathering up her skirts to resume her harsh, laborious course; but it might have been seen that, from that night, she more frequently delegated Euphame Napier tc"], [124, "The Diamond Rose. 110 fill her place, and relieve her from small duties.

And she would look at the girl's crystal rose sometimes, and cause her to repeat its destination, receiving the story gravely and doubtfully, but no longer with biting sarcasm. After the derelictions and desertion of the Crichtons, it was quite a grateful change to Euphame, that farewell interview with Adie Napier before he sailed to join what was fami liarly called the Scotch-Dutch force, and to hear him bespeak her indulgence, and assert eagerly, \" You mustna think me althegether a ne'er-do-weel, though I've 'listed, Euphame \u2014 the queen and the country maun be served, and I may do weel yet.

The Lady of Ormeslaw was satisfied ; and Euphame Napier having paid her duty to her patroness, received Mr. Durie's blessing, and said farewell to Mrs. Jonet, turned her back on the old house in Bristo Street, which to her would henceforth be tinged with rosy morning colours. She is to be waiting-woman to my Lady of Ormeslaw. Waiting-women in Anne's reign were very fre quently poor gentlewomen, daughters of clergy men, of professional men, or of merchants like Euphame's father, more gently bred than penuri ously bent. These waiting-women formed a peculiar"], [130, "116 The Diamond Rose. class in a peculiar position. They were divided from their employers by a very narrow line, and, in their fairest colours, were capable of filling offices of great importance in the household, and of dis charging the most serious duties ; proving often excellent nurses in times of sickness, faithful stewards on occasions of absence, tender mothers to orphan families, and not seldom fixtures under the roof which had first sheltered them \u2014 firm and valuable family friends. Lady Ormeslaw sent in horses to Edinburgh for Euphame and the spring supplies of merchandise, and thus the young waiting-woman was furnished with a proper escort, as carefully as if she had been a lady visiting at the house. There were the old serving-man and his wife mounted on the same mare, and the farm lad, with pistols at his holster, on the young pack-horse, and the black pony for Euphame. Travelling was difficult and treacherous a hundred and fifty years ago, and Euphame was fortunate in such a mode of conveyance to her new home. On a June morning, then, when the dew drops were on the corn and the lark in the sky, the"], [131, "At Ormeslaw. 117 little train rode along high-roads, by warm thatch roofed farm-houses, and lowly clay-biggins, and squalid miners' huts \u2014 through blossoming clover, and white-budding beans, and rich plantations, with the blue belt of the Forth and the hills of Fife visible from every high ground, and the green Lammermoors, in long low swells, shutting in the prospect. Ormeslaw was strange to Euphame. It was a peel tower, which had passed from the hands of border chiefs to yeoman lairds. It had a vaulted kitchen, a wool-room, and a few closets for do mestics in the tower ; and underneath were the nursery for the children, the sleeping-rooms of the family, a black wainscoted dining-room, and my lady's room, which was hung with the Seasons in tapestry. Without were brew-house, malt-barn, and kiln, with straw-house, cow-house, stable, and kennel. In this Ormeslaw dwelt a devout, sedate, sagaci ous, silent laird, and his more worldly and managing dame, with their children and retainers. Euphame came to fill a vacancy in the household. Lady"], [132, "118 The Diamond Rose. Ormeslaw was the very reverse of slothful. It was therefore no soft-spoken lass she wanted to tie her hair, lace her stomacher, or \" cast up \" her accounts. But she was reasonably ambitious, \u2014 she wished to have a set of worked chairs, such as we see now, with straight arms and backs, and covers in faded tent-stitch, routed out of odd dusty corners ; she would have the little lasses learn straw-work, filigree-work, and gimp-work betimes ; she would acquire the newest notion in vogue as to washing gauzes and Flanders lace ; she would see the last shapes for pastry and butter-work, and obtain the plan of boning fowls without cutting the back, as well as secure for the bairns writing lessons in the most approved hand, and \" the best end of dancing \u2014 a good carriage.\" Euphame was received in state by the lady, a shrewd-eyed, light-footed, fresh woman, rather brisk than dignified, but sufficiently authoritative.

In every guise, Euphame was tall and straight, and fair and comely, as her old mother had been. Lady Ormeslaw received Lady Somerville's greeting, and presented Euphame to her charges, who were stalking boldly or stealing slily across the threshold to stare at the stranger in my lady's room. \" This is Primrose, (hold up your head, Primrose,) and Sybilla, (Sybbie, you hempie, where have you torn your frock ?) and little Annie ; and yon is Roger, with his feet wet from the plough, and Sandy, who has been seeking birds' nests. The laird will appear presently and preside at the evening ' exercise,' and we need not disturb Master George at his books.\" Euphame lived weeks at Ormeslaw before she saw the laird at other times than at meals and the morning and evening exercise, which he con ducted with great ability and solemnity.

A canny housemate the lady owned him to be, yet he had proved himself a formidable foe during the bygone political and religious troubles \u2014 a far-sighted, ener getic, determined, and invincible man. He was big and stalwart, and his ruffled shirt and his signet ring contrasted broadly with the maud which at home he wore strapped across his broad breast, like his own hinds and shepherds. His face was rugged and thoughtful, and the eye had a wild gleam in it, answering to the fervour and the eloquence of his preaching and his prayers. In his temporal affairs he was sensible, patient, and painstaking , and in his personal behaviour, modest to bashful ness. The quiet laird of Ormeslaw in fact walked through life with a still, pondering, reverent tread, and his foot had acquired a soft, prolonged fall, like a deep gentle key-note, which could, however, clang with a hoarse thunder. Still, without doubt,"], [135, "At Ormeslaw. 121 the laird of Ormeslaw was not wholly free from the sins of his generation. Master George, the laird's son, was quite a dif ferent man from his father. He was of weaker thews and sinews, as well as of different metal. He had been in London, had seen the court, the clubs, and the wits, and had cultivated the pungent, half-melancholy literature of the era, as well as the. town's foppery and affectation, until he had grown ashamed of the plain Presbyterianism of his country and his youth. But he was not ashamed of his father ; he had rather a private envy of him, and a secret reverence for him. Master George had not renounced his virtue, though he had heard it suspected on every side, and indeed was almost tempted to suspect it himself. Smart and bitter though his tone was\u2014 and, alas ! it was often but the echo of his young heart \u2014 yet every now and then there welled up from it a gush of the sweetness of domestic life and pure family af fection.

Now, the laird read mostly one book, and that, in short, thoroughly-digested passages; and though it did not save him from all bruises, it had never yet induced him to sneer, or yawn, or dally with busi ness, or desert duty. The lady, too, was a little uneasy about Master George, for a mother's instinct is very keen. She had a painful perception that her son, fine gentleman as he had returned to Ormeslaw, and refined as he had become, was yet neither so safe nor so happy a man as his father. Master George scarcely deigned to notice Mis tress Euphame after he saw how sedately she sat at her worsted work, and how unimpressed she was by his airs and quotations.

It was a somewhat rash act to bring them so close together. Scores of waiting women besides Abigail Hill, climbed into their mistress's seat and ended by being my lady. And it must be confessed Lady Ormeslaw was not so disinterested as to wish Master George to find a wife without either fortune or available con nexions. She troubled herself a little with doubt ful precautions : she nailed herself to Euphame's side when the lady and her waiting-woman were not wanted in still-room or kitchen, and when Master George chose to display his book in my lady's room. She was always very careful, too, to qualify her approval of Euphame Napier's personal and mental attractions, by a few drawbacks.

She said, \" I must please my Lady Ormeslaw, or she will not retain me ; and then if I please her heartily, she may raise my wages, and I will save more crowns, and the sooner fulfil my engagement. A solitary lass like me is set aside for such a work.\" Euphame, like all castle-builders, was absorbed, and blind and deaf to other interests. Any inter ference with her efforts, or disturbance of her economy, provoked her till she awoke scandal, and got the name in the house of Ormeslaw of being \"a proud peat, for all her diligence \u2014 a hantle haughtier than the lady hersel'.\" The consciousness of this pained Euphame with an uncertain, flitting pain. It smote upon her as she listened to the young birds fluttering and chirping among the ivy of the orchard, as she stood watching the sheep inclosed in the sank, and as the lady kissed the child she had chidden, and allowed it to sob itself to sleep with its head"], [143, "Inward Struggles. 129 against her knee. Even at the tent-preaching, when a black cloud drifted across the sky, and forked lightning played about the preacher and his awed congregation, and torrents of rain scattered them for a season, and she was pushed aside under the dripping churchyard wall \u2014 then a cold mantle seemed to warp her round, and she shivered at the heart, while her jewel and her hospital retreated into the far distance, and loomed there, figures disproportioned and spectral. Then she felt it had not been so with her poor old mother, and she cried for that mother's simple kindliness as the greatest boon she could possess. Yes, poor sufferer, perhaps pure, sympathetic abandonment is the most enjoyable of earthly feelings to the good, honest heart ; but there is more than enjoyment to be sought and bought in this daily round. So Euphame would soon recover herself, and think with shame of her free pledge to Lady Somerville, of her many prayers, resolutions, and hopes, and how nothing great is ever done without voluntary stedfastness and sacrifice. She had read hundreds of times"], [144, "The Diamond Rose. 130 of that wise woman in Proverbs, how she rose ere it was yet day, how her candle went not out by night, and she thought how often she must have said to herself, \"A little more sleep, a little more slumber ;\" or, \" Push aside the distaff, lay by the merchandise;\" \"day is for mortal care; let us rest now, and be thankful.\" \" Tell the tale, sing the song, call out the blythe laugh of youth, and the slow smile of age. Others have their delights, and they thrive upon them ; why should I thus stint myself, and be styled an earthworm by common rumour, ere my children rise up and call me blessed, or my husband praise me ? The field and the vineyard, the scarlet, the tapestry, the silk and the purple, may be but mocking rain bow delusions, and I may be giving my strength for nought \u2014 for nought, in the moping, mournful end.\" And Euphame knew too how the wise woman must have stood stanchly by her banner still, and stifled the pleading, passionate, unbelieving voices. Then Euphame wondered that she could have ever felt lonely and weak, in treading the path which pale, slight Lady Somerville had walked"], [145, "Inward Struggles. 131 before her; and she was the braver and more deter mined in her allegiance, because she had swerved from it for a moment, and listened to natural voices and natural warnings. Euphame and her diamond rose ! had they been seen together half a century sooner they might have given rise to a tale of witchcraft or of fairy power. A certain glass-slipper had not more effect on the fortunes of its mistress, than Euphame's crystal blossom had on the luck of Lady Somerville's maiden. Perhaps old Mause measured Euphame more truly as she twirled her thread and leant her head, with its peculiar, high-cauled curch and black riband, to one side, and blinked half shrewdly, half pathetically with her old eyes, and maundered half in her defence, -half in her condemnation : \" She's of gentle degree, our Mistress Euphame, and she has grand principles and parts, (she would work, billies, till she would dee,) and she's very helpful to the lady.

TEMPTATION AND ADVENTURE. \"PUPHAME'S immobility was twice put to the test. On a harvest afternoon, she was sitting working in my lady's room, while, with the vivid blue above them and the golden oats waving around them, buxom men and women in striped jackets and shirt-sleeves, deep-coloured petticoats, and olive knee-breeches, heavy shoes, or bare feet stained with the brown soil of labour, were busily at work, their voices rising fresh and hearty though a little boisterous. So enticing was the scene, that even the lady was attracted from her post of weary observation and watchful guard. Euphame sat almost alone in the house, save that Master George stood before her,"], [148, "The Diamond Rose. 134 twisting between his long fingers one of the pale, creamy pink roses, whose petals, though they droop as if they were sick at heart, yet long survive the blush of the red, red rose of June. Perhaps it was unbecoming the hour and season, and unsuitable to her age and sex, that Euphame should sit thus in a misty, breathless dream of work. But Master George had made one dis covery, he found he had been in error in despising Euphame Napier, as she carried his mother's keys and plied her needle. There was a certain harmony in that completeness ot life \u2014 narrow as it was \u2014 in that assiduity, courage, and faith, just as there was harmony in the tall fine figure, in the youthful, blooming face, grave, yet cheerful in its ruddiness and roundness. She was working a green cloth cover for the parish session-room table, sewing round the border, in antique letters \u2014 \" The Lord is only my support, And He that doth me feed ; How can I then lack aniething Whereof I stand in need ?"], [149, "Temptation and Adventure. 135 \" He doth me fold in cotes most safe, The tender grasse fast by,\" and repeating, with lingering pleasure, \"He doth me fold in cotes most safe, The tender grasse fast by, \" when Master George interrupted her with a remon strance on her ill-timed industry. Master George twisted his rose, and even argued. Had Master George said bluntly that Euphame's application was ill-timed, that all God's gifts are to be reverently and thankfully accepted and enjoyed; had he undertaken to beg his mother to grant her a holiday with the others, then he would have read her a manly, brotherly lesson. But he spoke stale treason against earnestness, obedience, truth \u2014 counselled Euphame to amuse herself, dissipate the vapours, bask in the sunshine \u2014 suggested that she should avail herself of the lady's absence, and break off from her confinement and drudgery \u2014 and concluded with a hollow profession that he had no personal end to serve, that he was indifferent and impartial in the matter. He never hinted that he was weary of himself, that he panted for change,"], [150, "The Diamond Rose. 136 excitement, and diversion, that the fever goaded him on to interest himself in Euphame, \u2014 to enter himself, and decoy her to accompany him, upon a labyrinth, easily traced for the first few yards, but whose further windings might be very steep, very slippery, very dark. Euphame was startled, and she stared at Master George as he stood there twisting his rose, and speaking hurriedly and with perturbation. She seemed to see her own little diamond rose spark ling on in secret for years and years in its box, shining like a star in the blue sky, even when her body was mouldering in the grave, and she said to herself, \"That is duty, and this withering rose of a day is pleasure.\" So when Master George offered her his flower, she declined it, not in the fluttered tone which he had used, but quietly, though with a long breath. \" I'm much obliged to you, sir; but the blossom is faint, and the leaves would fall fast on my work. I'm free to pluck a posy for myself when I am not throng ; but I thank you all the same. My lady bade me make speed, that the table might be covered come Sabbath;"], [151, "Temptation and Adventure. 1 3 137 and, indeed, I'm fain to be done as she intended. If you please, Master George, don't trouble your self any longer about me.\" And Master George flushed with shame, and tossed the powder out of his hair by turning abruptly on his heel. Convinced of Mistress Euphame's bad taste, or converted to her good sense, he from this day onwards slighted her, as he had done at the beginning. And there came another attack on Euphame's stillness and self-concentration. The pond of Or meslaw \u2014 the chosen region of the lady's ducks, and the occasional resort, in very hard winters, of dainty but spluttering black water-hens \u2014 was never safe, however treacherously smooth. The old water sources of the moat fed it, and it had under-ground connexion with the dam of a mill at a quarter of a mile's distance. Its depth varied seriously at dif ferent places, and at different times, so that the children of Ormeslaw were formally forbidden to frequent the fair, deluding mirror. But, alas for the piquant flavour of forbidden fruit to those who have not had the proof of the pudding in the"], [152, "The Diamond Rose. 138 \" preeing \" of its final bitterness ! Bairn after bairn of Ormeslaw had been found guilty of transgressing this particular statute, and had been well whipped by the lady. The girls would still stealthily wash their dolls' rags in this inexhaustible reservoir, and dress their hair in this glittering looking-glass, while the boys would dabble with their bare feet in its holes, fish for minnows and eels, and steer their tiny boats in its bays. Little Sandy of Ormeslaw was creeping under the thorn-bush on the further side from the house, and just over against one or two stepping-stones into the pond. Although it was harvest-time, many of the family were within call ; but Sandy, unob served, had got out to the nearest stone with his cutting from the inch-thick stem of a bour-tree, so scooped out that it was the nearest thing in the world to the canoe of an ancient Briton. All at once he lost his balance, slipped, and would have sunk, had not his \"polomie,\" or \"daidle,\" of blue linen caught on the thorn, and held him up. But his garment was not strong enough in texture to hold, and the yarn which the lady had sown, and"], [153, "Temptation and Adventure. 139 grown, and bleached, and spun, excellent though it was, had been worn thin by a whole summer's wear and tear, and was fast rending with the little fellow's dead weight, while the pond, so alluring at other times, was now drumly and dark under his chin. Sandy screamed lustily; but his position choked his voice, and a child's muffled cry, among the quack of ducks and the cackle of errant hens, was not a sound to be regarded with particular atten tion at Ormeslaw. But Mistress Euphame chanced to look out, (to the day of her death Euphame was thankful for that look,) and, without thinking of calling other assist ance, she ran down the stairs, and out at the door. In a moment she was round the pond, and in ano ther she had her foot on the stone and her grasp upon Sandy; but as the touch severed the last fragment of the cloth, she too swayed with the impetus, and the large stone rocked beneath her. Disregarding the prickles, she instinctively caught the boughs of the thorn with her free hand, and clung to the bush, since, burdened as she was, she could not recover her footing. She knew, from the K"], [154, "The Diamond Rose. 140 unsteadiness of the stone, that the water there was at its deepest. Euphame uttered a low, prevailing cry, \" Help me, help me, with Sandy!\" She believed herself near drowning, but it was borne in upon her that she was to save the child. It was to the child that she summoned aid in what had become her own extremity; and she even prayed thus, \"Lord, help the child and me !\" At that unwonted sound, all Ormeslaw sprang into commotion. The lady ran from the brew-house, the maids from the wool-room, the men from the barn, the laird from his closet, and Master George from his promenade ground in the orchard. It was marvellous how the single petition, sobbed rather than shrieked, could have echoed so widely. Certcs Mistress Euphame's voice had weight and force in its most subdued compass. The rescue was imme diate and complete; and afterwards, the crowd could do nothing but exclaim, and protest, and be grateful to Providence and Mistress Euphame. The Lady of Ormeslaw hugged her boy for half a minute, and the next bade him beg his Maker's"], [155, "Temptation and Adventure. 141 pardon, and his father's and hers, for his obstinacy, and let him come into her presence again that day if he dared ! She then whispered Mause to follow his retreating footsteps \u2014 half-penitent, half-petulant already \u2014 and change his wet clothes, and give him his warmest hose, and the sweetest slice of diet cake in her cupboard. Then she took Euphame by the arm, and said, \" I have not done you justice \u2014 let me speak. Mistress Euphame, you maun have a leal heart; you have saved, at your own risk, one of the bairns whom I trowed you slighted. You never counted the cost; you saw nought, you minded nought but Sandy. Three-fourths of the lasses that would have played at the ba' with them, and tossed them in the orchard, and kissed them till they were wrathful at their very fondness, would have flung up their hands, and screeched and thought on themsel's, and lost the wean. Mis tress Euphame, you might have been my lad's mother, so little did you hesitate this day.\" Euphame's gray eyes expressed her astonishment \u2014 \"The bairn was in danger, Lady Ormeslaw; I was bound to deliver the bairn.\""], [156, "The Diamond Rose. 142 \" Come in, Mistress Euphame, and rest yourself in my chair, and take a sup of the Laird's hollands 01 claret, or of my elderflower or cowslip wine to keep off the cold. Na, na, lass, ye maun receive some thing at my hands, ye maun suffer me to tend you \u2014 the poor laddie had to be banished for an exam ple to the lave, and to save him from deadlier falls ; but you'll permit me to do you a kindness this minute \u2014 you'll not send me quaking hand and foot back to the maut without a thought of relief to my bursting heart?\" And Euphame did endure the lady's offices, trembling as she did so. But it was not from cold and agitation, as the lady supposed, but because in the sweetness of her comely, goodly womanhood, and the nobility of her maidenly excellence, hardly a caressing look or touch had rested upon her, and she shrank from them now with shy, sensitive reserve, for they seemed to revive afresh the sense of her old bereavement. Soon the temporary overflow of feeling subsided. The Lady of Ormeslaw was again the mistress, and Euphame the waiting-woman ; but the lady would"], [157, "Temptation and Adventure. 143 trust Euphame henceforth, would think kindly of her, would cast upon her many of her quick, friendly glances. Euphame was moved by these tokens ; they disturbed her, bewildered her, almost plagued her \u2014 but they served to stir her quiet, deep heart"], [158, "(, <44 ) IV. A MEETING AT THE BLEACHING-GREEN. \"1 VISITORS came to Ormeslaw when the har- vest work was ended, and the hunter's moon looked down on the stacks in the yard, on the ruddy apples and blue plums in the orchard, and the dunning of the birken trees, whose roundels formed the portals of the grey house \u2014 visitors more interesting to Euphame than she could have dreamed of. She was in her working-gown, that \" holland with the natural flowers,\" and \" clean cambric cap,\" that she might watch in the bleaching-green while the lady's mays in the great kitchen set out the dinner for the working-men, with the tankards of October from the \"bow of maut.\""], [159, "A Meeting at the Blcaching-Grccn. 145 The country bleaching-greens were spots of great importance in those times as in later days. The tending of the house-mistress's yarn, her fancy work, in which she was for ever dabbling, was neither an irksome nor an unwelcome post in the long list of country duties. It was not so exciting as the watching of the bees from the woodbine bower, when they were expected to hive on the chamomile bed, or so social as the haymaking, and the shaking down, and gathering, and storing of the apples in the fruit-bin; but then it lasted all the year round except in churlish winter; it was in high progress on the May gowans, and it was only concluded under the stiffening starch of the first frost. Many a young lass chewed the cud of sweet and bitter fancy at the bleaching-green, learnt her catechism and sung her songs there \u2014 and there were more confi dences interchanged than that between Peggy and Jenny. The private bleaching-greens were sometimes in dark Highland glens, sometimes on green Lowland haughs, sometimes by the borders of wild brown"], [160, "146 Tlu Diamond Rose. moors, but, more or less, they answered the pretty familiar description: \u2014 \"A flowrie howm between twa verdant braes, Where lasses use to wash and spread their claes ; A trotting burnie wimpling through the ground, Its channel pebbles shining smooth and round.\" To Euphame, in her meditative, in-door life, the bleaching-green \u2014 coming in the way of duty, and involving careful regard to the treasures of the winter's wheels and the weaver's looms \u2014 was almost as agreeable an interlude as a visit to the toy-shop was to one of the frivolous fair ones who were gadding so wildly among the rackets of London. The Ormeslaw bleaching-green, along with many advantages, had the disadvantage of lying along the high road, being only separated from it by a horn-beam hedge. There was thus much risk to the pieces of cloth and bonnie hanks of thread fiom tramps and beggar wives. On moonless nights a regular guard was established to give the alarm. It was composed of a woman or two and the old serving-man, a person in authority like his wife Mause, (my lady had even been known to under take it herself when Mause's spring and autumn"], [161, "A Meeting at the Bleaching-Grecn. 147 coughs interfered). And Euphame Napier had been proud to be appointed captain of the watch \u2014 and to sit in a great camlet cloak, looking at the stars shining out behind the passing clouds, and to listen to the tales of her subordinates. And she would sometimes give them a strengthening verse when the silly wenches, or sillier men, frightened them selves with legends of brownies and elves, spirits and ghostly warnings, or the women started vio lently at the far-off bay of a wakeful watch-dog. As Euphame sat one afternoon, presiding over the future napery \u2014 that delight of old Scotch and German households \u2014 she was not astonished when she heard a step on the other side of the leafy screen, walking in the direction of Setoun, and a youthful voice lilting, most harmoniously and blythely, My soger laddie is over the sea, An' he will bring gold and money to me.\" Yet something in the fearless, sweet, small compass of the voice aroused Euphame, and she looked eagerly through the first break in the barrier. Did her eyes deceive her? was it really Katie Crichton"], [162, "148 Tlte Diamond Rose. before her ? Yes, it was. Katie Crichton, in Eu phame's afternoon dress, only a hundred times airier and jauntier. She had scarlet top-knots, where Euphame wore primrose, glittering glass beads, and bugles all warped and twisted over her stomacher. There was lace round her peaked shoes, a solitaire at her side, and a Holland fan in one of her mit tened hands, although there was no sultriness now, to warrant such an aid to zephyrs. Katie's roving eyes fell on Euphame immediately, and, with a gleeful laugh, she burst through the open space, and greeted her old friend without the smallest hesitation. \" Eh! Euphame, Euphame Napier, wasting your self with work as was your wont, in a gown no better than a cottar-man's daughter's, and you straigh: and blooming! I would have kenned you among a thousand, lass! And how are you faring?

Katie and she had little in common; they had not been the best of friends; they had parted under a cloud ; but we would think less of Euphame if her heart did not warm to poor little Edinburgh Katie down there at Ormeslaw. It does strike an observer that our ancestors were kindlier than we are, in their narrower spheres, and their more practical and less metaphysical natures. A neighbour was a neighbour then, let him be what he might. They took him as they found him. If necessary, they opposed him to their heart's content ; but even while at feud with him, and con demning him unscrupulously, they retained a good many of the charities of life at his command. People were not cosmopolitan then. No doubt they were far too confined in their ideas, but still the overplus of benevolence was in favour of the neighbour."], [164, "The Diamond Rose. 150 Katie did not look as if she needed forbearance ; she stood her ground, a very well satisfied, trium phant woman. \"What brought me here? aiblins my feet, Euphame,\" \u2014 and Katie showed those pre posterous little shoes\u2014\" and they had not far to come.

I do not want to renew old quarrels with you, Euphame Napier; I'm not reflecting; I'm very well off and attended to at Setoun. The earl is thrang with his politics. They whisper that he has a bee in his bannet, and that he'll burn his fingers; but never you leet, Euphame, it is no business of ours. And there's Helen Lindesay; she's only half a Setoun, and a lady, but I maun say she's very condescending to me; and there's Master Ludovic would divert me from morning to night if I liked.\" \" Na, Katie, you should not listen to the young gentleman.

In these family parties Euphame had her full share. Lady Blarney found it necessary that her gentlewoman should not only be a well-bred girl who could read and write, but that she should be able to behave in company. It does not seem, in reality, that in the general family life of even strict Covenanters there was any powerful objection to harmless mirth and sober pleasure.

And it was very touching that night to listen to the laird's supplication, which rose out of the fulness of his heart. How pathe tically he petitioned that his lad, having been delivered from the grossness which beset his pre decessors, might use his freedom nobly, and might not enter another fool's paradise to have his limbs bound with new ropes and fresh withes, until at last his hair would be shorn, and his strength depart from him ! But in the end the laird resolved on going up to London with his son, to satisfy himself regarding his prospects, and to introduce him to his own po litical friends. The lady and the children must accompany them; and on account of this strange episode in their history, Euphame parted from them with goodwill on each side, and vain promises"], [201, "77ie Crichton Household. 187 of future intercourse. She soon learnt that she was to have Katie Crichton's company to Edin burgh, for Katie was also out of place; not, how ever, owing to Master Ludovic's heedlessness, but because, on one excuse or another, the Wintoun family were suddenly getting rid of many retainers and hangers-on at Setoun, especially those who were in connexion with the capital. Katie bore the loss even more patiently than Euphame; she feared the country would be dull in the depth of winter; she was sure Master Ludovic would call upon her in the High Street; and Mark, she averred, would not dare to control her now, after she had been an independent woman, out in the world on her own footing. And, besides, it was a welcome change, for one who was altogether the denizen of a town, to be in the \"good town\" again. Agreeing to ride into Edinburgh in the same cavalcade with Katie, Euphame was to proceed with her to the lodging-house in the High Street, for it had been settled by Lady Somerville that she should dwell with Mrs. Crichton, and main tain herself by her handiwork until she should N"], [202, "188 The Diamond Rose. find another situation. There was no incongruity in this arrangement; it was dictated partly by necessity, but largely by that old bond of neigh bourly regard which has been commented upon. Lady Somerville had long ago forgiven Mrs. Crichton, and she did not see herself warranted in depriving her of any natural advantage and emolu ment. Euphame could neither be with my Lady Somerville nor with Mistress Jonet; and so she was commended to her old companion's mother, Mrs. Crichton. Mrs. Crichton was careless and impro vident, but she was far from dishonest and disre putable, as the times went; and probably her failings would not have been improved, had she been deprived of her resources and curtailed of her custom. Euphame was a well-principled, staid girl, and could take care of herself. Thus Euphame rode once more by Pinkie House. But it was on a winter's day, when the hoar-frost was glittering on bough and bush, as if all the world was a-flower with diamond roses. She went quite cheerfully to the stirring house in the High Street. She found herself installed"], [203, "The Crichton Household. 189 there without any tribulation in her own mind, or in the minds of her friends on her behalf. She sat at her frame, or practised her womanly performances with application and stedfastness, unharmed by the rout around her. Perhaps in some degree her presence tended to compose it, like Jacob when he served Laban, or Joseph when he found favour in his Egyptian master's house. If she had experienced any dangers too great for her strength, she might have risen and fled; but that would have been an extreme case with a cha racter like Euphame's. This maiden of my Lady Somerville's inspired respect wherever she went, and to excite that seeling even among careless, irreverent, sceptical people, was to confer an inva luable benefit. So the first small, round hail drops of De cember fell among the soot and smoke, and scarcely dried blood stains of old Edinburgh, and Euphame watched the shower from one of those many square windows which look bare facedly, and sometimes at such adjoining angles into each other, that facetious lodgers could hob-"], [204, "The Diamona Rose. 190 nob, drink their claret, and take their snuff in com pany.

But it gave a mighty fine air to the whole to have an approved volume or two among the details. So they, too, had their folio, with \"great jars of china placed one above another in a very noble piece of architecture,\" their quarto separated from their octavo by a pile of smaller vessels, which rose in a delightful pyramid, besides their tea-dishes of all shapes, colours, and"], [205, "The Crichton Household. 191 sizes, so disposed on a wooden frame that they looked like one continued pillar indented with the finest strokes of sculpture, and stained with the greatest variety of dyes, and their grotesque square filled up with \" scaramouches, lions, monkeys, man darines, trees, and hills, and a thousand odd figures in china ware.\" Among the books might possibly be found \" Sherlock on Death,\" and \" Ogilby's Vir gil\" \u2014 \" Locke on the Human Understanding,\" with a paper of patches in it \u2014 \" The Academy of Compli ments,\" and La Ferte's \" Instructions for Country dances,\" and certainly \"A Spelling-book,\" and \"A Dictionary\" for explanation of hard words. Well might the visitor wonder whether he were \"in a grotto or in a library.\" But if he had been told he was in a sitting-room, surely he would have commiserated the penance done by the habitual occupants, and the incessant expense incurred to supply unwitting breakages.

Well for Euphame that she had excel lent nerves, and unsurpassed powers of self-concen tration. Indeed, they were an extravagant, unsettled, disorderly family, these Crichtons. Their position might be a little in fault; for it was that debateable position which requires all the energies to pre serve its balance, and which has not a broad enough basis for duties, although it affords quite a wide enough space for rights. What could be expected from Mrs. Crichton, who kept a lodging house, and from her daughters, who were poor waiting-women, but a fight for a living and a striv ing after rank ? Again, how cruel to deny them their gentility, and their dishes of tea, their little privileges and comforts at which they grasped in the midst of their struggles! Mrs. Crichton was Katie grown old, with the"], [207, "The Crichton Household. 193 ghost of Katie's beauty, but it was by no means a faded ghost, rather a purple one, for Mrs. Crich ton painted pretty coarsely.

The custom was so very common, that the Specta tor ranges those who painted and those who preserved their original complexions into two races, and dubbed them the Picts and the British, and urged without a particle of acrimony, or any but the most literal view of the subject, the superi ority of nature. Poor Mrs. Crichton \u2014 corpulent, painted, with her gray hair powdered so as to cover its whiteness, and her bishop satin gown side and wide, was un conquerably careless, and from hand to mouth in her household economy. She had denied herself nothing, save in the upholding of the porcelain mania. She denied other people nothing.

A worse guide for youth that looked to her for direction or owed her deference, could not be imagined. Yet Mrs. Crichton had her redeeming points. She was very good-natured, and was always vaunting Euphame Napier's steadiness and retire ment from the world ; although she herself yawned, and dawdled, and stretched herself unceremoniously, and built up her china and fed her animals every hour of the day, and owned that she could not live without company. Mrs. Crichton had also an un qualified respect and affection for her son Mark, though, it must be said, Mark was harsh, intolerant, deficient in outward respect and consideration for the mother who wasted his slender means as a lad, and would have wasted his ampler means as a man, had he not taken all the care he could to prevent it. If Mrs. Crichton had been attached to a rough and upright support like Mark in her young days, would she have fared any better? Katie's sister Mysie was an older Katie, \u2014 not so bonny or beguiling, not so wilful, and not so open.

It was a miserably easy matter, in those regardless, corrupt times, to compass sin and ruin; but the story sped in very much the same circle of shame, anguish, and retri bution. Mark was cognisant of his sister Jean's fate; some portion of his earnings fell to the ground mysteriously, and in return Mark owed to an \" un fortunate\" sister the additional sullenness which weighed upon him, and made of the grave morose boy, a gloomy, passionate man. It was a bitter crown to Mark Crichton's strong, dark manhood, that droop of the lips and contrac tion of the brows, that helpless protest against the cup whose dregs he shook and stirred up, and excited into more noxious fumes. Ah! Mark ex perimentally knew nothing of dropping into the draught wood more potent than that of Moses, salt more efficacious than that of Elisha, the symbol of the cross, the figure of another's effec tual and victorious sufferings. Euphame Napier was sorry for Mark Crichton now.

She was not frightened at Mark as the others were; he did not repel her as he repelled the pleasure-loving Katie. Possibly Eu phame rather admired Mark, though she did not approve of his gruffness as she did of his brawny arm, his resounding foot, his high head with its coal black, tangled hair. He was evidently a man at war with the world, and even with his remarkable strength and endurance, worsted and bruised, though not yet wholly beaten in the contest. And poor Mark's motto, for ever on his lips, was the sentence inscribed in the neighbourhood of the house of his master, Paul Romieu, the foreign clockmaker in the Bow, where the first watch made in Scotland was put together : \" He that tholes overcomes.\" Think of that! Great for a stoic, small for a Christian, if he is like Mark Crichton. For when Euphame asked him what he would overcome, and for whom, he answered, with a short laugh, that he knew not, unless crowns like Adie Napier's guilders ; and when he had earned them, he could not tell what he would do with them. He would"], [211, "The Crichton Household. 197 not found a hospital; perhaps he would gather metal and cast another statue of another debauched King Charles for another Parliament Square. Yet this stubborn, mistaken, unhappy man, as Euphame had penetration to discover, jealously kept his old George Heriot's tokens; would steal at an idle moment into the grounds of the hospital, and lie moodily meditating under its trees ; and follow his master, Paul Romieu, armed with a cudgel, to de fend him from the prejudices of the vulgar, every time he went abroad of nights ; though Master Paul, the meekest of little, bright-eyed, vehement, entranced, loyal men, repudiated the attention as an old form of servitude, vexatious and humiliating, and not to be exacted from an apprentice of parts and breeding. And to this savage Mark, and his squandered allowance, Mrs. Crichton had recourse every few weeks, wringing her hands the one moment and clapping them the next.

For the most part they conde scended to easy intimacy with the Crichtons \u2014 and found them very available, admiring, humble friends, who aped them enthusiastically, and would have toiled till they fainted for them \u2014 or their estate. Thus we understand why the intrepid Countess of Nithsdale, in her perilous adventure for her lord's safety, at the last hour, confided neither the secret nor its abetment to her friend the Duchess of Montrose, nor to any of her noble kinswomen, but trusted implicitly to the adroitness and devotion of Mrs. Mill, the keeper of her lodging-house, and one Mrs. Morgan, in the same degree; and it is \" dear Mrs. Catherine,\" whose name is used to smuggle out the first performer, and \" dear Mrs. Betty,\" who is honoured with incurring the penalty of high treason in the person of the second player, while the principal in the act \u2014 my lord himself \u2014 assumed her part for the nonce, as well as the sandy hair, painted cheeks, and hood, and effected his"], [216, "The Diamond Rose. 202 escape under the well-managed disguise. So even the Queen of the Amazons, loving Grizel Cochrane, relied on her old English nurse, and not on brother or sister, in her bold device to reprieve her father. These lodgers afforded samples for the Crichtons to copy in their absurdities. Rich neighbours, pray bethink you of your double, who is to revive your cast-off foibles with still more preposterous, still more disastrous conclusions. After breakfast, in the lodging-house in the High Street, there was a great ringing of bells, rat-tatting of ebony sticks and scuttling to answer them, loud talk, make-believe work, sometimes displeasure and recrimination, but more frequently right Epicurean laughter. And then the great business of dressing began. Oh! that dressing, that dressing ! One has not the least ado to credit the country vicar's daughter cooking the wash half the day over the fire, when here was the hairdresser daily \u2014 his time filled up till seven at night, being sometimes de tained two hours in this single house.

One is impressed with the determination of the heroine who would not appear in the comfortable undress of the silk sacque or the gauze nightgown; it was so tedious a matter, that we find the shred of an apology for the justly railed-at foreign fashion of receiving company during the process; it was so serious an interest, that we are a little less astonished to hear that great Lady Mary did not look into her glass for eleven years, because it had no pleasant answer to convey to her. After the dressing appeared the visitors, motley enough in truth, and still inextricably entangled with the Crichtons, whose work never interfered with their world, however their world might con fuse and impair their work. The desultoriness, and above all, the half-tavern ease, made the lodging house a favourite haunt for the wags, the gay madams, the pretty fellows of the metropolis, when they were not, alas! more wickedly engaged in their insane gambling, their gluttony and drunken ness, their riots and murders.

And if the quality had their meetings, the Crichtons, \"sib\" at a great distance to the old chancellor, moved among their betters.

It is granted this was only possible to a girl endowed with strength of mind as well as simpli city and godliness, but after this concession, the reality itself is insisted upon. Euphame looked up into the blue sky and saw her home, her Lord, her Father there, and believed that she had a commis sion in the meantime to work while it was day ; so she was never unemployed, uninterested, listless, discontented, weak, worthless. While she looked to the end, she did not despise the means. Work \u2014 needle-work, worsted-work \u2014 was not despised in Euphame's generation, or was only despised by the idle, gadding, dissipated pleasure-seekers. No one dreamt of its insufficiency as a resource to the modest female mind. The more virtuous and pious, and the wiser a maid or matron, the more she was addicted to tapestry and embroidery.

Look again at Euphame in her tall stature, her brown hair now darker, her gray eyes deeper; her full placid lips, a distinguishing feature in her face, slightly parted.

So Euphame consented for once in her life, and went across the moor, where the lively pro menade of Princes Street now runs, to have cakes and cream at the bun-house of old Edinburgh; \u2014 but Mrs. Crichton had made private provision for ducks and green peas, and little glasses of smuggled brandy. Euphame counted for company with Mark, pressed into service as an escort; but Mrs. Crich ton had her gossip Mrs. Hughes, and Mysie had her friend Madge Haldanc, and her side-looking, plausible, sycophantish brother, whom Mark could not abide; and Katie had picked up gay, idle Master Ludovic, of the noble house of Wintoun, who happened to be in town, eager for amusement ; and at the last moment Lady Cauldacres' daughters fancied they could undertake the walk, and con sented to grace the company ; so that it was quite a cavalcade which started through the Port, to waken up the moor with their laughter, and frighten the bittern by their flutter and flash and fume.

Then the milk was turned, and Mrs. Crichton had been too late in ap pointing the fresh batch of cakes, so that the mis tress of the house had fired them in a hurry, and burnt them black on one side. Altogether, those who partook of the legitimate fare required to make the best of it, and to overlook the fact that the young ladies of Cauldacres sniffed scornfully at their dainties, and feeling more wearied and less enter tained than they expected, immediately gave them selves airs, fanned themselves, and threatened to swoon.

These strangers had all to bear, more or less, the pre judices of rude, ignorant people. With the Romieu family, the circumstance of their being suffering Protestants had worked strongly in their savour here, as in every other northern capital. The Scotch General Assembly had not yet done voting its sympathy with the last fruit of the Albigenses, and its indignation at the cruelty of their enemies. Still, the sympathy and the indig nation soon died out in London itself; and the sub scription for the crowd of haggard, scared, or frenzied men and women who were founding the colony of Spitalfields was soon closed.

She termed Master Paul her son, or her little son; and she had once volunteered to recite and translate, for Euphame's benefit, a foolish fable of a sheep that spoke, a cabbage that ran away, and a fir-tree that sat in judgment on the rest of the party. Euphame was naturally large minded as well as la*rge-hearted, but her education was what Lady Mary called the \"worst in the world, that of Clarissa Harlowe's,\" and with women grave and a little cold-mannered, like Euphame, there is the same antipathy to babbling extrava gance and incongruity that is to be found in the corresponding order of men. Euphame discovered Madam Romieu in her bare room, which had neither carpet nor curtains. The chairs were painted white with gilt edges, and an alabaster clock of Master Paul's stood among brown pipkins of all shapes and sizes on the shelf.

He was quite comfortable in this assurance, and no more thought of interfering with Mademoiselle at the sick-bed than he would have expected Ma demoiselle to meddle with his workman's bench or his magnifying glasses. But, when he came up stairs to dinner or supper, he would start forward and ask such wistful questions, and raise Madam's pillow so gently, that the tears would come into Madam's sweet black eyes while she laughed at her little son.

Alas! the cherry-coloured gown was in too pitiful contrast with the dark shadows hollowed out by illness, and the pinched, unshaded features, set off and beautified by the mildness and disinterestedness of their constant voice and speech. But Euphame had come there to relieve the fantastic body of a disguised Frenchwoman, and found herself serving a saint; and in place of reaping the applause of a"], [252, "238 The Diamond Rose. good conscience, she was at first disturbed, ashamed, and unhappy, particularly when Madam would exalt her in her active benevolence, and disparage herself as a poor helpless sinner, to whom everybody was over kind.

Madam recounted with delight how he was reverenced and admired, how every one came to style him Father Paul, not because of his age, for he was hardly in his prime, but in virtue of his great attainments. Right womanly was the line of argument by which Madam Romieu owned she was gradually impressed with the conviction that it was a bleak and barren height which Master Paul had reached, that of being Father to all \u2014 their patron, protector, and instructor, with none to bend over him, to keep watch and ward for him, and he a passionate reck less man for all his wisdom.

And there had never been any confusion therefrom, since Madam's little child had died on their toilsome precarious passage to the coast when they escaped the Barbary pirates, and reached this secure Scotland, still spared to one another.

Nay now, Euphame, dinna shake and cover your face with your hands, for if you enlighten Mark, I'll say you betrayed me to compel his favour; and if Mark follows on our traces, Master Ludovic will fight, and the blude of my brother or my husband, or both, will be on your head \u2014 do you hear, Euphame Napier?\" And Katie departed with her fugitive in the cold, dark morning, thinking little of what was before her, and thinking as little of those she left behind."], [302, "( 2SS ) V. THE CRICHTONS IN DISTRESS. TV /[\" RS. CRICHTON was elated beyond measure at the success of her scheme; the only thing that damped her pride and sanguine expec tations was the necessity for continued secrecy. Mysie was half piqued, half pleased. Mark's trust was entirely abused. Euphame remained silent ; having been taken unawares, the high-minded, stedfast woman was caught in the toils of sly little Katie Crichton, and the part of accomplice which she seemed to herself to fill told more upon her than any degree of violent exertion or sus tained drudgery that she could have gone through with a true heart.

Her conventual tone even assumed a penitential shade, so dark and down-looking and doomed did she grow. She was restless, pained, ashamed, dis satisfied with herself, disconcerted with others, and disheartened as to the future. She not only avoided her early friends, Mrs. Jonet and Lady Somerville, but constantly shunned Mark Crichton, who was quick enough to take the initiative, and withdraw from her repulses with a sullenness that might have proceeded from prickly pride, or an old heart-wound suddenly reopened. She shrank from the Romieus \u2014 gentle Madam, acute Master Paul; she positively loathed her hostess, wheezy, chuckling, reckless Mrs. Crichton. It was a very unsatisfactory frame of mind, and not very consistent with her faith and hope. Yes, this was a very unhappy period of Euphame Napier's life, but it would not have been so miserable if she had been well balanced, ready disciplined, and perfectly fault less in the matter. If her spiritual faculties had been healthy, her passions and affections in fair proportion, she would easily have rounded this"], [304, "The Diamond Rose. 290 critical point in her history. As it was, the spring of 1 7 16 dawned upon Euphame very coldly and bleakly. February brought the lords' trials in London, and March and April their sentences. In a few weeks the tidings were generally known in Scotland that Derwentwater and Kenmure had suffered ; that Carnwath, Widdrington, and Nairne were left lying in the Tower; and that Wintoun had escaped on the eve of his execution, \u2014 an act of intrepidity and good fortune shared by Nithsdale, Foster, Mackin tosh, and half a score of less notorious offenders. Though not an agreeable surprise, it was only such as might have been expected, that Euphame, when she returned one day from receiving some tapestry orders, found Mrs. Crichton rocking her self in her chair, and sobbing and lamenting over some unexpected misfortune, but at the same time not failing to strengthen herself with her ever present sweet cakes and strong waters : \" My poor lad, my innocent lad ! We'll be rouped out of house and hold now. He'll be hanged, and we'll be starved. Alake! alake!\""], [305, "The Crichtons in Distress. 291 Mysie, more prudent and acrimonious, closed the door of their best lodger's room, and soundly rated the fugitives : \" The thankless, mean pair, to leave us to pay the lawing. I told you how it would be, mother. There is your favoured bairn! there is the crew you would lend yourself to shelter!\" \"What ails you all?\" asked Euphame, absently and with apathy; for hidden, resisted suffering, unless in rare constitutions and in exceptional cases, tends in itself to blunt such sympathies as, left free, would have sprouted fresh and green. Was it one of those dishonourable scenes of debt and arrest of which her mother had told her when she was a girl ? But here was no officer ; and Mark would have been sent for \u2014 Mark would have done something for their relief. Was Katie concerned in their vexation and anger ? Was it an accident to Katie; an exposure of her real circumstances?

He did not look severe, as was his wont, but very sorrowful. \" How could Katie treat me so!\" said the strong rude scapegoat of the family, but very softly for him ; for though it was recognised in the house that Mark had entertained a lurking fondness for Katie, in spite of his strictures on her volatileness and un concern, he looked, while he spoke, at wise, busy, meditative Euphame Napier, and his glance asked, \" Were you, too, full of woman's folly, and not above low, mean ambition ? Were you, too, ashamed lest your true friends and peers should see this and justly despise you for admitting it to walk hand in hand with your duty and your devotion?\" Either the accusation was there, or imagination supplied it, and remorse caused Mark's somewhat hollow and reproachful eyes to burn great holes in Euphame's heart."], [308, "The Diamond Rose. 294 Mark was removed to the Castle. There was no more inaction for Euphame Napier; no more regular plodding woman's work, with high aim, but great efforts for humanity's sake, for Christianity's sake, because Mark had no brother, because Mrs. Crichton was a widow, because mother and sister were incapable in their affliction, because Euphame knew too well how Mark had been duped. There could be no harm; there could be no loss; who would count the loss, when toiling, enduring Mark Crichton was led unjustly to punishment and death?

Why not learn another sort of endurance? Why not learn the beauty of ser vice, and having done His bidding, and endured to the end for Him, sit down with Him in His kingdom?

Mark had been arrested there, and already Madam, in her cherry coloured gown, and her quick, foreign pantomime of extreme interest and lively sorrow, was quickly filling a basket with food and clothes. \" See, Eu phame, I go to the Castle ere the gates are shut. Master Mark wants nourishment, and, yet more, a friend to pray him to eat and drink. No one will object to me \u2014 I hope not \u2014 at least I can try. How barbarous! how untrue! Master Mark, who was in the trades'-bands with my little son, who would have stabbed the first man that entered the city.

Master Mark would not thank you for it.\" And then she hurried off to Master Paul in the shop. Master Paul was unusually brisk counting over his crowns and guineas, and rummaging among his receipts. He had scarcely time to do more than nod with friendly peremptoriness, and say warmly, \" I know it, Mademoiselle \u2014 console thyself \u2014 I go to defend him.\" Euphame drew back with a sense of impatience and annoyance at the sight of the money. The Romieus were not rich. Master Paul had paid a considerable sum lately for the freedom to practise a particular branch of his craft. He was bound both by inclination and principle to assist the necessitous Huguenots, and Euphame was certain that Madam grudged herself a new cherry-coloured petticoat and velvet boddice, lest she should defraud the poor. Besides, Euphame had no desire to be indebted even to such friends as the Romieus. It was this young girl's desire and purpose to rely upon herself, to wish to be the stay of others. From this cause, now and henceforth,"], [311, "The Crichtons iu Distress. 297 Euphame made no attempt to apply to friends; neither to Lady Somerville, nor to Mrs. Jonet, nor to Lady Ormeslaw, nor to Lady Morriston, who had entertained so great a kindness for the young serving-woman ; nor even to Lady Logan down in Leith yonder. Euphame belonged to those old Scotch whose decent pride sometimes reached the height of an insurmountable aversion to interference and assistance. And something within Euphame Napier cried out passionately against permitting the Romieus to make this sacrifice for Mark, against permitting any individual out of his own household to bear the cost and the risk of abetting him. Yet she was sickening at the sense of Mark's danger ; and there was no saying how low she might be brought by his condemnation. She did not know what to do ; for the first time in her life, her staid, strong mind was in a whirl of contending emotions. She only waved to Master Paul, and, to the clock maker's wonder and disapprobation, authoritatively bade him stop short in his preparations: \"Stay, Master Paul, for the present, till others have con-"], [312, "298 The Diamond Rose. suited and conferred.

She had heard of the Whig advocate who advertised himself the friend of the beaten Tories, and instinctively evinced her approval of the proclamation by having recourse to him in her difficulty. But she still stubbornly resisted the idea of trespassing on his generosity, and rendering Mark Crichton indebted to any individual, however well endowed and gracious, out of his own family.

If the prisoner escaped with his life, he must expect the forfeiture of his goods and the probable banishment of his body from the kingdom.

But it is precisely to these just women that is given, in most instances, a capability of affection, an unselfishness of friend ship, a tide of fondness, a romance of love, for which the fearful, trifling, and insincere have neither space nor nourishment.

How dare Euphame deny him his portion, unless for a prior claim and a more sacred obligation? And Mark was in trouble.

It was the only time in her life that Euphame Napier refused to listen to utterances which she heard as realities in the depth of her soul, piped ever so feebly, whether in sweet languor or in gushes of fitful harmony, amidst the thunder of former duties. It was the only time perhaps that she dealt in conscious self-deception, and was full of cowardly, nervous, obstinate resistance. But all that was over. Euphame no more pro posed to deny that Lady Somerville's maiden, who had promised to prolong Lady Somerville's charity and replace her hospital, loved and suffered for Mark Crichton, than she was inclined to contradict the fact that Mark was lodged in the Castle, with heavy iron bolts drawn across the door of his narrow, sordid chamber, and a sentinel planted at the end of the corridor. For though Mark was no noble to be lodged softly and fed daintily, neither was he a common criminal in the disorder of the cavernous Tolbooth, but a prisoner of State, along with the discontented, imperious, hare-brained gentlemen of the traitorous and ineffectual rising of \" the Fifteen.\""], [322, "308 The Diamond Rose. The rose-flush, the breadth of amber, the height above height of blue were in Euphame's heart in this chill gray of early spring, along with the green boughs, and the callow birds, and the ballads and the tales. But that heart was barred close as the guardroom in which Mark Crichton, strong, active, industrious, yet morbid in his very vigour and honesty, drearily languished. Should she fling wide the door, or close it for ever? Should she spend her treasures on the prisoner, if haply she could reach him, and then shed what remained on Mrs. Crichton, for whom Mark had striven so long, and who would, in spite of entreaties and remonstrances, squander Euphame's wages, on idleness, vanity, and profusion ? And ought she thus to break her promise, resign her well-matured, disinterested, benevolent purpose? Should any man come between her and her pledge? Should she deprive the aged and afflicted of her bounty? Where was now the picture of the old mother in the Trinity ?

She might well confide him to them; they would do the best that kindliness and mercy could compass. And Mark's plight, indeed, might be exaggerated, he might be libe rated scatheless; or if not, sure her efforts would do little to turn aside his punishment. Nay, nay, her efforts would effect whatever human love had accomplished, and love had burst through guards and bolts, swayed courts of justice, bent kings' minds, and wrested rope and axe from the executioner. She must not think of Mark perishing while life throbbed in his veins. God was merciful to her. He did not ask her to do more than strive and pray, and believe in Him till the blow was struck.

Then the evil spirit tempted Euphame, as be sure he tempts us on all the mountains and in all the deserts of our moral fields. He reminded her of her profession, taunted her with the scorn she would draw on herself, on her convictions, her education, her foundress; held her up as the laugh ing-stock of such as Mrs. Crichton and Katie, the coarse-minded, the shallow, the sensuous; humbled her to the dust with the mere conception of Mark"], [325, "Euphame's Determination. 311 Crichton's gratitude, gratification, astonishment; and bade her sell her birthright, not for love to God, or love to man, but out of dread of censure, un womanly pride, idolatry of the small spark of her credit among her fellows.

She sat down passively, waiting for the flash of conscience, or the answer to prayer, till the oil in her lamp was exhausted, and the flame leapt out, and she was left in outward darkness, as well as in inward pur turbation and dismay. It was a terrible riddle for a woman to read. Perhaps in the nature of things the question could not be answered speedily. Euphame must watch and wait and grope in the dark, and be baf fled in her attempts at certainty, and be baptised by sadness and sickness into higher wisdom, more advanced truth, and fuller, meeker love.

But she had caught three clues in the labyrinth, and though they were not cables of conviction, they were stays to the ship wrecked, to the sincere, sensible girl. And Eu phame was an honest woman ; she did not refuse to see them and take hold of them, though they were as fine as lace threads. If it had been for Mark Crichton's good that they should be separated; if she had been satisfied that it was for the eternal welfare of both to be rent asunder, she would have signed the bond and looked to the better country.

If she had listed her hand ignorantly and audaciously against either, should she not let it fall down forthwith? In exhaustion, she dozed in her clothes, lean ing against the wall, just as Mark might be doing, without heart or hope to undress and stretch himself on his prison bed; and \" 'twixt a waking thought and a sleeping dream,\" there flashed on her the recollection that George Heriot's palace hos pital was first opened, not, as he had projected, to bands of innocent, aspiring boys, but to troops of soiled, suffering soldiers. You can have no idea how that remembrance helped Euphame at this hour of her little day;\u2014 the \"still small voice\" of Providence, why do we not listen to it oftener ? Lastly, when Euphame turned sorrowfully to Holy Writ, it glimmered faintly on her with a throb of comfort that the world is one wide hospital, God's hospital \u2014 not my Lady Somer ville's or Euphame's \u2014 and that what was nearest to her, that, first of all, she ought to do."], [328, "The Diamond Rose. 314 It would be hard to convince many, and im possible to persuade some, how much easier in one sense it would have been for Euphame to have endured a spiritual flagellation, to have become in soul a pillar saint, to have practised will-worship in any form, than to be thus convicted of error, to write what was fallible, transitory, and unstable on her dream and her pledge, to fancy that her diamond rose blighted her with a baleful light, and to resign her pretensions, and retrograde into the private ranks of fond, weak women, and to conduct herself henceforth much on their lowly model, and with their unobtrusive result. Yet vigorous and healthy as Euphame's nature was, she had pressed up the steep till her feet tottered and her brain was dizzy, and now she had no other refuge in her distress but her belief that God would not suffer her to sin a deadly sin, and that if any man is a transgressor, he hath an intercessor, \" even Jesus Christ the Righteous.\" Her struggle over, Euphame slept with weary profoundness, until Mysie stood by her bed, newly returned from the ridotto.

In the chill hour, when night and morning meet, Mysie's vain, crafty heart, strained in the race of dissipation, had flown back with an agony of desire to family ties, and she sped home to call up Eu phame Napier, and ask what she had done in the affair, and command her, almost fiercely, to rise up and resume the business.

They were not likely to be of use to the lad if he should be sent to the Grass-market, or even to Barbadoes. And Duncan Forbes concealed from Euphame, shrewd as she was, the heavy expenses which lay on so unfavourable a suit, and how few coins dropped at last into his ever open purse, and how he lost some crown promotion, and the special honour of my Lord Grange's countenance, by his perverse persistence in providing justice for the rebels. Once Euphame went to the Castle with Madam Romieu, and stood trembling, as so many women of the period steeled themselves to do, in a cell beside her lover. She was a little hurt to find how distant and gruff Mark was, how much more distant and gruff than during those summer days with the Romieus. Yet he questioned them narrowly how they were to get home, and charged his guard to"], [333, "Mark Crichtons Trial. 319 see them beyond the gates ; and when Euphame looked back from the court-yard, he held by the bars, pressed his face against the aperture, peered after them to the last moment, and then, when he saw Euphame watching him, waved his hand. She cared little afterwards for the hill and its famous view, which, they say, on a clear day reaches far away to the blue Grampians. She would have given her right hand to have trans ported Mark Crichton beyond those mountains, though it had been but to tend sheep in the glens, rest in a pine-propped, birk-bound bothy, and drink green whey to quench his thirst \u2014 about the mildest Lowland notion of life in the Highlands in that generation. The crisis for Mark came on at last, the day of his trial, as one among a number of suspected men, before Court and Commission sitting in the old Parliament House. Big-wigs were scowling there to hide their own private obeisances to the Court of St. Germains ; big-wigs were yawning at the ever-recurring ceremony; there were big- wigs complaisant, grudging, cordial, or hostile; and"], [334, "20 The Diamond Rose. 320 spectators, breathless, bullying, and listless, because it was only a clockmaker, and who cared whether a clockmaker- were hanged or no! Mrs. Crichton, voluble in her very extremity, confided her con cern for her son Mark to all around her, begged a sniff of their perfume, or a dose of their drops, and screamed so loudly when Mark was introduced, that the whole court was brought to a stand-still, and a cry rose for order. The poor young man turned wildly towards his mother. Euphame, though spared by Duncan Forbes as a witness, was there, and stood near one of the windows, so quietly that an inquisitive woman begged her to hold her fretful child for a moment, while she rose on tiptoe to catch a glimpse of the villain, and then whispered in gratitude to a com panion that the tall blooming quean was surely no canny, for while she took good care of the child, she remained as mute and still as a figure on a monument. And poor Mark was there \u2014 the prisoner! The very accidents of his circumstances and his personal peculiarities told against him. His tradesman's"], [335, "Mark Crichtons Trial. 321 position removed him from temptation, and caused him to represent the body of the people, who were the solid foundation of the Hanoverian succession, and in whom any defalcation was particularly heinous. In his swarthy complexion and dark hair, prejudiced eyes saw the hue of a bold, and even fierce disposition. And then he was refractory in bearing, and talked discontentedly; and when Euphame heard him speak, she gave a great start, which further disturbed her imaginative neighbour. Mark who had borne so much, who had yielded so much, who had been the tool of silly and selfish women \u2014 Mark discontented and refractory ! Euphame had forgotten all grounds that could exist for accusation. The sentence was pronounced. True hearts gave a long sigh of relief and thankfulness ; for it was a marvel of mercy for the times, when forged bills and horse-lifting were constantly digging felons' graves. Mark was neither to be executed nor banished; he was only fined a sum which was as much beyond his means as a patent of nobility. But what at that moment was beggary or slavery to death or"], [336, "The Diamond Rose. 322 separation from friends ! Mark's friends pressed around him, and shook his hands, still powerless with the weight of those heavy fetters which loaded many a man brought in for trial under implication in the absurd Fifteen. Nobody had reason to complain of Mark's apathy to-day; he shook hands eagerly with all around him, and he addressed Euphame directly, \"Ah! Mistress Euphame, I have cost you more than I am worth.\" Who had told him ? They had professed to be silent without any request from her, and always insisted that they had not broken their promise. But Euphame did not mind the discovery now ; she would never have mentioned her offering to him or any one, although she had not man\u0153uvred to keep it secret. There was neither blame nor shame in it; it was natural to help them \u2014 to help him; and his tone was so gentle, and calm, and friendly, that he seemed to accept the boon as a matter of course. Surely Euphame was not vexed by that, but rather submitted cheerfully to his gratitude, when it was so quiet and reasonable. Afterwards"], [337, "Mark Crichtons Trial. 323 there might come a blank, a sense of something wanting in Mark's submission to her gifts, \u2014 a dis satisfaction with his equanimity, an unconscious, unavoidable longing for another distinction than that of being Mark's benefactress. But there was no room for such feelings or fancies when Mark was freshly delivered from danger, and walking briskly home. And if it should be Euphame's doom to have wasted the best of her treasures, and to wither under the deprivation \u2014 yet she was no love-sick girl, and her heart would only bleed away, drop by drop, while she was showing herself a noble, active, benevolent woman to the day of her death. Mark Crichton's good fortune did not end at once. Duncan Forbes, by his influence and his unflagging exertions, in a few weeks obtained an extension of the term of payment of the fine, so that by skill and industry he might at last be able to stand up a free man in spite of his share in the trials of the Fifteen. Katie's folly had only lost her brother the bloom of his age and the prizes of his manhood ; but not many of"], [338, "The Diamond Rose. 324 the sufferers in the rebellion escaped so lightly, and he is a fool who does not count his gains as well as his losses after he has passed the brunt of the conflict."], [339, "325 VIII.

She was a little pensive, too, for was she not wistful and weary, misapprehended and misjudged? A long lifetime's labour could not restore to her the value of the rose whose sparkling leaves she had shed so ruthlessly. She could scarcely hope, with the Crichtons sharing her gains, to amass in the course of a single woman's life a sufficient sum to revive the old vision. So she would flag sometimes in her application, and meditate on mental food of her own, and droop as she medi tated.

And then she would recover a portion of her energy, and sigh out to herself that the whole world was God's hospital. Euphame had to undergo the trial of all who change their opinions and relinquish their positions; to Mistress Jonet she was a renegade, to Lady Somerville a backslider. \" Euphame Napier, I renounce all call and claim upon you,\" so Mistress Jonet began. \" I would not be leagued with you more.

Euphame Napier, I bid you farewell.\" Lady Somerville accosted Euphame in a different fashion. Though she visited less than Mrs. Jonet, she took a chair and came expressly to the lodging house.

Mistress Euphame, they said, lofty and precise as she was, had a liking for Mark, which Mark requited to their minds in a courteously indifferent fashion, as indeed how could Mark, ground down by his fine, think to woo any lass?

Master Ludovic had dragged Katie from one resort of the fugitives to another, dived into den after den, where she was exposed to insult as well as insecurity, and where she was sometimes compelled to perform harder tasks than those to which in childhood Mrs. Jonet had in vain whipped and spurred her. At last a spare berth presented itself in a French ship dodging about the mouth of a harbour awaiting the outlaws, and Master Ludovic with decision appropriated it, and generously sent back his wife, shaken and spent, to her former friends and home.

Was this the end of female diplomacy? Mrs. Crichton and Katie did not blame themselves in the fruit of their rank flat tery and audacity, which had all but destroyed their prop, and stripped and blighted their family tree. They clamoured about the misfortunes of the cause, and complained of the general falsehood of men, and the wrong-headedness of Mark, which had impelled them to the peculiar prosecution of their designs ; and Katie seemed to gather the little spirit that remained to her only to expend it in a vindictive grudge against my Lady Somerville and her hospital, and Mrs. Jonet and Euphame Napier. Amongst her other sins Katie had always indulged herself in a scorn of Euphame, and an unbounded license of speech towards her and her ways, combined, however, with a perfect reliance on her magnanimity and benevolence. This kind of esti mate of her character might be complimentary, but it was not comfortable, so long as Euphame retained the ordinaiy feelings of womankind ; any more than it was pleasant that this thin, dark, haggard, slipshod Katie or Mrs. Setoun (Madam"], [352, "338 J lie Diamond Rose.

Then her old sanguine flighty spirit came again; she was no longer the trodden-down, exasperated woman who had sat so long in the chimney corner of the house in the High Street, and occasionally frightened away from the premises the halting procession of lodgers. She termed her boy the heir of Setoun, and was proud of him. She was young yet; she was still able to receive the long-suffering boon of another spring of buoyance and cheer, and if ever influence pure and tender was to touch her vain, selfish heart, and render it more capable of re ceiving higher impressions, it was centered in this wailing infant, with which even Katie was capti vated, and in which her old mortified self-satisfac tion found a gentler outlet.

She remembered all with the fondness \u2014 \"the tender grace of a day that is dead\" \u2014 which absence and distance lend to past scenes. She wished she had enjoyed more the family-life at the good laird's, enjoyed more the country hearti ness and simplicity and inexhaustible rural plea sures; she wished that she had then reckoned the world the great temple, school, hospital, marriage hall, cradle-bed, and bier of humanity, and acted as holding that if we make any one of its aisles our prison-house, we err and are incomplete in our Christianity.

One of them, a child of two years, had been slung in her tartan screen on her shoulders, his chubby arms about her neck ; the other, a lad of five or six, was laid across her lap, and wrapped in her skirts, which he now clutched as he stared, half-scared, half-defiant, at the spectators. The house to which the stair led was ruinous and unoccupied, and a projecting booth hid it from casual observation.

Euphame was brave enough to keep her own part and stand by her resolution, and preserve her privilege of succouring the bairns ; but still she was thankful for Mark's testimony and grace, since the children were additional barriers between them. Euphame reflected with a tearful smile that the Lord was a bountiful giver, more bountiful to her than she herself had been far-sighted or provi dent. She had dreamt of being a daughter to the"], [368, "The Diamond Rose. 354 old women of the Trinity, and instead, He had given her sons, goodly sons, who, as Mark said, might \"scoug her grey hairs.\" Euphame slept with the younger boy in her arms, and the elder in a resting-place at her feet, where she could start up to soothe him if he awoke in sudden terror. And listening to their quiet sleep, and feeling their balmy breath, and remembering the dead Highland woman and the trust she had taken from her powerless hands, and thinking of Him who was her everlasting friend, and the friend of little children for evermore, her whole heart melted and overflowed in love and pity and faith."], [369, "( M ) III. REINSTATED IN FAVOUR. ' \u25a0 \"HE children were not sought after; Euphame was suffered to keep them. Their orphan and unprotected state was too common in Scot land then, and commoner still twenty years after wards. Soon enough they forgot their losses, and the event which had transplanted them to the Low Country. They were soon acknowledged as High Street children, and grew and gambolled with the best, under the name of Euphame Napier's boys. Euphame, in her honest orthodox notions, even had the younger boy baptised by Mr. Durie, and stood herself as the sponsor, and \" took the vows,\" which in Scotland are generally laid upon the parent of the child. And when Mr. Durie had concluded the"], [370, "356 The Diamond Rose. rite, and listed his staff to depart, he raised his left hand and solemnly blessed the whole house. Euphame then felt as if the peace re-established between herself and her old teacher descended on the dwelling which had been the chosen scene of the waiting women's follies. And it may be mentioned that, with the matter-of-fact and quaint simplicity which mingled with the artificial extravagance of the generation, Euphame named her adopted son Niddry, after the street corner where his mother drew her last breath, and where his mother by love first cast eyes upon him. Some ridicule and scorn were excited by the improvident connexion which Euphame had formed for herself, but in general the world took the proceeding easily ere it \" rose up and praised her.\" Other simple souls in by-ways acted as generously as she; other un worldly spirits were as faithful and fearless in the performance of their role. There is trace remaining of one at least \u2014 Meg Matthews, an old Spartan maid-servant to a learned, pious divine and his wife, who, dying early in their married life, left a family of helpless children. Meg took them and"], [371, "Reinstated in Favour. 357 toiled for them in her garret, trained them in righteous ways, and sent them abroad to do their father's and their Lord's work, and to bear evi dence that she had not been found wanting in her fealty ; and the only daughter of this group became waiting-woman to the Countess of Hopetoun. Callous, selfish, and malicious as the world is apt to be, yet, in token of its divine origin, it warms into admiration of a deed of noble, true-hearted philanthropy. It resembles the public on the stage of ancient Athens. When the old man entered and stood neglected or jeered at for his forsaken fashions and out-of-date opinions, the Spartan rose and respectfully and modestly resigned to him his resting-place. The whole versatile Athenian company uttered a shout of approval of the courtesy, till they were recalled to their self consciousness by the voice, borrowing the oracle's authority, \" The Athenians reverence noble acts, but the Spartans do them.\" Euphame carried on her labours as unconsciously and inevitably as she had started forward to release little Katie Crichton and Alison Hughes from the"], [372, "The Diamond Rose. 358 grasp of the Edinburgh mob, had delivered Sandy of Ormeslaw from the swollen and treacherous pond, and had risen to rescue Mark Crichton, charged with rebellion and lodged in the Castle of Edinburgh.

Her own old friends especially laid down their prejudices, and resumed their original cordial and loyal belief in their \" maiden.\" Lady Somerville begged her to bring her \" billies\" to her house in the Queen's Close, and whispered, with her incomparable sweetness, \" My lass, you've cheated us after all, twice cheated us; but, indeed, we're blythe to be so mistaken. I will say, you were wiser than we. And hark you, Euphame, for your sake, I will not believe the chield Crichton was aught but a worthy chield wronged, and they do say he's a famous tradesman, and so you'll give me due warning to provide your pearlins; and you'll suffer me to be at charges with you for the weans, my good Euphame.\" Mrs. Jonet, with her incorrigible sternness, stood"], [373, "Reinstated in Favour. 359 at the door of the lodging-house in the High Street one gusty night, but would not advance an inch beyond the hasp. She summoned Euphame to speak to her at that inconvenient and surly station, and thrust into her hand garments stitched by the last of Lady Somerville's maidens, saying, briefly, \" You may lichtlie them, lass, or no ; take them or leave them, as you please. They are to help to deed the lad-bairns for whom you'll strip your own back, for I ken you well of auld ; or I thought I kenned you.\" She then marched away, without waiting for a reply, more huffily to all appearance than when she arraigned Euphame before the bar of her conscience. Even Adie Napier, in course of time, heard in Flanders or Spain that Euphame was protecting a soldier's sons; and he sent home by a disabled com rade, not a sack of guilders (alas for the grandeur of boyish dreams!), but a doubloon or two, with a humble deprecation of what he had wasted at play and in the Flemish taverns. His wife was dead, and Adie was again alone and thrown much upon his reckless comrades, planted in a flitting camp,"], [374, "The Diamond Rose. 360 and roving with it from country to country. \" But, Euphame, I have not forgotten George Heriot's ' Wark,' and I have imparted to others something of what I learnt there ; and it may be they'll produce the results wherein I've failed, though I'm too well informed, lass, to trow these will be counted to me.\" And the comrade confirmed Adie's assertion that he would discourse round the watch-fire, and in the hospital, and at their rough board, of his early advantages, and strive to spread the knowledge he had received, and endeavour, as far as he could master his facile temper, to check the vice and brutality around him. And worthy, grey-headed officers would congratulate the simple soldier on the sober and thoughtful men in his company who had been ready at the call of duty, and had died in hope. The names brought impetuous tears into Adie's blue eyes, as he earnestly disclaimed any share in their merits, unless, he added hesitatingly, they could be counted in a degree the better sons of the good Scotch goldsmith, George Heriot. There had been a time when Euphame would"], [375, "Reinstated in Favour. 361 have been indignant, and have fretted at any offer of assistance, \u2014 would have toiled day and night to work out her purposes by her own unaided exer tions; but she was humbler now and gentler, and her piety was purer, and her charity, which is not so much giving of alms as \"in honour preferring one another,\" had increased a hundred-fold. Eu phame never stooped to beg, but she accepted free will offerings from those who had a right to tender them, and acknowledged them gratefully, and did not faint by the way, or fail at high noon. And you may be sure Duncan Forbes used his eloquence to urge some of his golden guineas into the pocket closed to the attractions of those superabundant yards of taffetas, \"the sweeping tails,\" in which the female heart delighted in those days. In the lodging-house in the High Street, Eu phame's boys were less esteemed ; but Euphame herself was there, and her presence was a shield. And though Ranald was fiery and resentful, the boys, secure in Euphame's quiet, deep fondness, were healthy, happy children, to whom a cross"], [376, "362 The Diamond Rose. word or look was but as a summer shower. Yet the lads needed benevolent guardianship, for against the wild John Highlandmen there still lingered in the towns a dark prejudice, made up of tenacious impressions of their forays and black-mail, and their lazy contempt for honest trade, and of fears of quick vengeance for small injuries. As for Mrs. Crichton, she would have stuffed and spoiled the spirited boys if Euphame had permitted it. Mysie superciliously ignored their existence; and Katie was as stingingly jealous of them as though they were Ishmaels overshadowing her Isaac. Mark only was at once wise and gentle towards the intruders; for he had lost much of his churlish ness since his trial and release, and presented now many of the nobler traits of the true Hercules, following haltingly the one perfect pattern, and learning obedience by the things which he suffered, the obedience which is the worship of the spirit and not the grudged service paid by the poor troll of a body.

The children were in"], [379, "Mark Crichton' s JPooiug. 365 bed, the very birds were at rest on their perches, and the lap-dogs were curled up in their corners. Euphame was alone and at rest, sitting below some green boughs which she had loved since the bright weeks with the Romieus ; but she had no nest of callow birds to watch and rear, her birds being her orphan children, and her bosom their nest, to which they could hie them and plume their wearied wings. Mark Crichton came in upon Euphame's medita tions, and inquired hurriedly for the others. His air was disturbed, yet the Forty-five was far in the distance, and he had no more to do with the last outbreak of the Stuarts and their partisans than with the war of the American Independence. Euphame was frightened, courageous as she had been, and sat timid and downcast. \" Mistress Euphame, I am a bad courtier \u2014 I should not begin with mysel', but my fine is com muted this day in consideration of the shield I devised and executed for the city banquet.

Why need you grudge me a king's or a beggar's boon? Will I abuse it, lass?

It was but a few slovenly, imperious lines, summoning her without ceremony to join him with speed in France. \" I am not getting on in this filthy country,\" he wrote; \" I have not got a place in a regiment, and if I am left behind when the rest go to the wars, I will be ill-off for company, and I would be more snug if a woman body of my own nation were here to attend upon me as I have been accustomed to."], [385, "Katie crosses the Seas. 371 So, Katie, you will speer after a berth in the first ship from Leith, and join me as is your duty.

But she soon took to gazing on her crowing child, and crying out piteously that he had never seen his father, and that he should be acknowledged by him, and named his son and heir, though grand Setoun and little Wintoun were still in ruins. And then she commenced to wonder whether his eyes were as like his father's as she had fancied, and if Master Ludovic's pink and white cheeks were as brown with his travels as Mark's. Poor young"], [387, "Katie crosses the Seas. 373 gentleman, doubtless he was footsore and spirit less! So Katie at last resolved on crossing the seas and joining the fine gentleman in his exile.

To be sure it was no sinecure to carry out the wishes of deaf, fractious, avaricious old Lady Cauldacres. Poor Mrs. Crichton was a treasure in comparison; but, then, Mysie honoured and admired Lady Cauldacres. And granting, alas! that it was for her pedigree, her battered plate, her antique jewels (half of them crystals and brass, as Master Paul could have demonstrated), the bias was an unconscious one, and the regard was in other respects sincere. Mysie did look up to Lady Cauldacres ; she dealt mercifully with her ladyship's faults ; she copied her ; she would have scorned to have been remunerated for her atten tions, say by such a fee as Euphame Napier had worked for at Ormeslaw ; and she would have hated herself if she had looked forward to her name's figuring in the old lady's last will and testament. And Mysie had not been used to re spect her mother, and was not inclined to make allowance for her ways; and as Mrs. Crichton retained Mark and Euphame Napier, she was"], [390, "376 The Diamond Rose. not guilty of the base desertion which the young ladies of Cauldacres had perpetrated on their honoured mother; and finally, strange though it may sound, if dawdling, supercilious Mysie Crich ton was to be transformed into an active member of society anywhere, her sphere of exertion did seem to be Cauldacres' place, and not the lodging house in the High Street of Edinburgh. Accordingly Mark and Euphame were appointed the props and stays of Mrs. Crichton, as well as the protectors of the Highland lads, Ranald and Niddrv. They resigned the old lodging-house in the High Street, as being unsuited to the new family circle and the claims and responsibilities of its members. Mark took the usual tradesman's flat, at the end of the crooked, clamorous Bow, at no great distance from the clockmaker's shop. For the Bow, in place of being distasteful to them, was endeared to them by association, and hal lowed by remembrance. Mark and Euphame were married in staid Presbyterian fashion, by good Master Durie, with"], [391, "Euphame in her own Home. 377 marked tokens of my Lady Somerville's pleasure. And at the last moment, to the surprise of all, the ceremony was honoured by the hard-featured countenance of Mrs. Jonet, as a pendant to the elegant dignity of the future Lord President. And that old wedding in the High Street had its bright picturesqueness, its soft grace, its courteous compliments, its thoughtful ceremonies, such as all true love weddings enjoy, whether their materials be of the soberest or the most splendid. In that generation all bridegrooms wore ruffles and buckles and powder for once in their lives ; and plain Mark Crichton was so earnest in the business, and so glad at its completion, that he would have worn red silk stockings and pink heels to his shoes had they been required, rather than have disappointed Euphame, who was a very woman about her bridegroom. All brides in the rank of respectable tradespeople rustled in brocades \u2014 those superb brocades \u2014 which yet implied no ex travagance in the wearing, for a wise woman like Euphame never thought of buying another all her life. That was the gala day of her life; and that"], [392, "378 The Diamond Rose. was her gala dress; and a noble woman she looked in her tall stature, with her warm brown hair, her rich complexion, her broad intelligent brow, her sweet, serene lips. And Euphame did not depart alone to her new home ; she carried with her Mark's garrulous mother and those exultant orphan lads. None need pucker their brows and whisper mysteriously of domestic privacy and family interference ; if they had lookedat Euphame in her godliness/sense, spirit, and tenderness, or at Mark Crichton in the growing religiousness and warmth of his manli ness, they would have dismissed all petty, paltry fears for their domestic horizon. Though Mrs. Crichton \u2014 large, discursive Mrs. Crichton \u2014 was that horrible bugbear to some, a mother-in-law, and though the little lads were aliens, young spit fires of John Highlandmen, Euphame and Mark looked down upon them like gentle sovereigns, right willing to share with them their royal revenue, and extend over them their golden sceptre.

Some anxiety however arose as to the boys. Strange as it may appear, Euphame had sore"], [395, "Unity with Diversity. 381 reluctance to part with them\u2014 with Ranald who was so manly, and Niddry who was such a scholar that Master Forbes took an interest in his studies. Both had so much confidence in her and Mark, and loved them so entirely, that they had well-nigh forgotten that they had not a drop of blood in common. Euphame laughed, with the tears in her eyes, at a jest which Mark, though no talker, repeated with glee, and at which the inexperienced boys were half-affronted, because it showed their rashness and their short memories. When some one had slighted Niddry for his low stature, Ranald maintained pompously that his brother would grow a mighty man, for their father and mother were the stateliest pair, and his granny declared their little sister to be the biggest baby, in the whole town of Edinburgh. And Niddry did not think of contradicting this defence. Then old Macdonald from beyond Invergarry was a Romanist or Papist, as Euphame styled him ; and if Ranald were inveigled into another rebellion, and Niddry were transported to Douay, to reappear with a shaven crown, and mumbling"], [396, "The Diamond Rose. 382 over his beads, Euphame would be bereaved indeed.

But honesty, faith, and charity came and dissi pated the ravelled threads in the hands that would have grasped each other cordially. Old Macdonald was deeply grateful, and could not do evil that good might come of it; while Euphame felt to the full in her candid heart the old man's generous reliance and self-denial. He would provide for the lads along with his other grand-children, out of the moderate but not despicable means of a hill-farmer; he would visit Euphame every time he was spared to come south. And so the lads went with their grandfather, to roam on the mountains, to bound like deer on the rifted rocks, to ride the rough ponies, and shoot from rusty carbines that had probably seen more"], [397, "Unity with Diversity. 383 dangerous work. And though they were inno cent lads themselves, it is to be seared they got acquainted with clansmen who, like Highland Bawby's brothers and cousins, had helped them selves to \"clouts\" from the vales of Menteith or Strathmore without the smallest hesitation. But these young John Highlandmen were tamed, and they eventually returned to their southern father and mother, and were obedient, respectful, and at tentive to their behests. Neither followed Mark's calling, however : Ranald became a soldier, and got a commission through Duncan Forbes ; and Niddry turned a curious antiquary and man of science, when men of science were confidently re garded in the popular estimation either as unfor tunate, crazed gentlemen, or impudent imposters. Poor Niddry rather shipwrecked his fortunes, and was glad to secure a humble competence for his bachelor peculiarities, as librarian to a gentleman who combined a little taste and talent with rank and fortune.

And Euphame paid a visit to that remote, inac cessible north country. She fed on cakes, milk and whey, mutton, chickens, and eggs, all flavoured with the peat smoke ; and she was entertained even in the farm-house of one who had considered himself a gentleman of the clan. She saw the women, whose weather-beaten ugliness amazed cool, polite Pennant, bearing on their backs creels of turf and loads of grass, green oats, or barley, like helots of the soil. She contemplated with keen pleasure and admiration, nay, with fervour and devotion, the everlasting hills, the lonely tarns, the rugged glens. Her health and strength was established, her vision broadened and made more clear, her intellect enlarged, and her heart calmed, as she helped Macdonald's women- folk to watch the goats and kids, the ewes and lambs, the cows and calves, out on the moors, or in the clefts and recesses of the hill-sides, or rowed with them in their boats on the lochlets, and fished like the men for trout, salmon, and oysters.

There are damask table-cloths, with her initials and Mark's woven in each corner instead of crests, and the Castle of Edinburgh, instead of the field of Worcester and the royal oak, in the middle; and she has her cabinets of plate, beaten and bossed by Mark's own hand, and modest are they after all, for a rich gold smith and clockmaker's wife. And she is as inde- fatigable a housewife as she was a serving-woman, and is not only a wise manager but an adept at deli cate dishes, and a choice brewster of birch, balm, cowslip, and elder-flower wine. And she has not only been reared to reckon these pursuits as duty, as laudable and improving, intellectual and artistic"], [402, "The Diamond Rose. 388 exercises, but she loves to see how highly her husband's mother is interested in them, how, strongly affected by example, she substitutes their mild, refreshing cordials for more noxious auxiliaries. Euphame is expecting Mark for his evening's leisure. He smokes his pipe like all tradesmen, and sometimes goes to one of the steady-going taverns, the news-rooms of the day, which all men frequent. But he mostly rests at home; for he was always a quiet, reserved fellow, and he is now a notably domestic man. Euphame is even wandering in thought to Mark's recreation, the book which has so entranced him, which has even fascinated her, and which is occu pying and delighting the great world. Before Mark read it his imagination had not been often stirred, and he had rather a strong than a lively fancy under his solid education. The vividly gorgeous, grand, or simple scenes of his Bible had stamped themselves on his mind, and so had the Scotch legends and traditions ; while his experiences, when he accompanied Euphame in"], [403, "A Family Council. 389 her enterprising, hazardous journey to the High lands, or the anecdotes she heard when she dwelt among the mountains, had been the most novel subjects reviewed at their hearth. But here was a marvel, and Mark was so full of it, and so pos sessed with the fate of the lonely, self-reliant Robinson Crusoe, that he even carried the impres sion into his craft \u2014 moulded mock calabashes and cocoa-nuts, and raised figures of savages or wild men distinct from the supporters in heraldry. He had a liking for the author, common to all resolute, independent, stubborn tempers. He had heard reports of him from eye-witnesses, who had got a glimpse of this \"true-born Briton\" when he was down in Scotland for once in his life, facilitating the Union, and when he acquired a hearty apprecia tion of the people, and bravely printed the same in opposition to the still active suspicions and an tipathies of the South Britons. In his recently emancipated Presbyterianism, Mark had sympa thies with the English Dissenter, and laughed over the banter of Defoe's early pamphlet, Speculum Crape Gownoriun ; and in his Whiggery he had"], [404, "The Diamond Rose. 390 pictured in his mind's-eye, with grim exultation, the pillory crowned with garlands, and the mob drink ing the health of the branded man. But Mark was not for any study unless a brown study this night. He stood by the window in meditation \u2014 a powerful, thoughtful, intelligent man, open-hearted and guileless if eager and un tiring, yielding to his wife, soft to his children, and probably a little put upon by the perennial baby. He stands with his cap on, his hands in his pockets \u2014 a tradesman's attitude; but many a fine lady who never sees a familiar cocked-hat save under its wearer's arm, might long and pine in vain for the confidential tenderness of his tap on his wife's shoulder \u2014 the invitation to the interview with him in the next room ; to which Euphame goes without a thought of censorious rebuke, or revela tion of sudden loss, or terror of unlooked-for sorrow. Unexacting Mrs. Crichton, unwieldy in size now, and content to bask in the chimney-corner, and be tended and taught by Euphame, and nurse the baby,"], [405, "A Family Council. 391 nods sagely: \" I warrant he has been called to the Council, or he has been appointed some second sort of Lord High Commissioner. He has gone to tell his gudewife first, as is proper, then they will communicate it to me, and I will answer from the psalm we sung last night, that there is light in the dwelling of the righteous, though they call it light of a different beam; but I'm blythe that my wee Euphame, and Jenny, and Duncan, and maybe our adopted callants, will never be seen begging their bread. I hope I'm no wrong; I've been a self-pleasing woman; but I trust my lad and lass have led me out of the broad way, as the angels conducted Lot out of Sodom. I pray I may not look back ; what for should I look back, when the heavenly fields are fair before me, and I'm striving, grey-headed, for the gate? \" However, Mark made no announcement of civic dignities to his wife. He only told her of one of those large and remunerative orders which, in spite of their original deficiency in funds, and their political taints and disabilities, had enriched the clockmaker's business, and enabled Master Paul to"], [406, "The Diamond Rose. 392 retire from the house with an independence, to pursue his philanthropic schemes, and his beloved scientific and artistic conceptions, without the trammels of jobs to order and bills to discount in payment. And Mark wound up the statement with a piece of general news which had, indeed, an individual application: \u2014 \"The auld Wrichtishouse \u2014 the Wrichtishouse of the Napicrs, your forbears \u2014 is reported for sale. Euphame, we might buy it, shields and corbels, mottoes and sculptured men and women, and lions and monkeys together, and make it our own again. Many a time I have walked round it and caught inspiration from the auld architects. It was your ancestors' house, Eu phame, and we can recover it and preserve the place, establish our name there, and rear another Pleasance in the middle of the Boroughmuir where the bolls of the oaks grew so tall and strong ; and we may then see the lads and lasses tread the auld dais-chamber, transformed into a tradesman's family-room, where little Euphame will first learn to totter in the inclement weather across the inlaid foreign planks, between the niches and the wreaths"], [407, "A Family Council. 393 of the banqueting-room, and if you placed your boughs there at Beltane or Yule, you would convert it into ranges of bowers or a forest-glade.\" \" Na, Mark, man ; you are dreaming of the ship wrecked man, Robinson Crusoe, in his island,\" cried Euphame merrily; \"but many a time my mother told me of the auld Wrichtishouse, and now it may be filled with Crichtons and Napiers to abide there, and hold their heritage redeemed by another brave goldsmith.\" \" George Heriot's wife was dead in his youth, and he had no friends so allied to him that they had a claim to interfere with his charity,\" mused Mark. \" Ere I heard of the Wrichtishouse to be disposed of, I had a thought to set for my wife a diamond rose \u2014 you mind it, Euphame? \u2014 and surprise her with it on her wedding-day, and leave it at her will to keep it or bequeath it, or spend it in an office of mercy as she pleased. But these hospitals, lass, they are doubtful institutions. Whiles I think they are like the dens of the hermits, or the cells of the monks\u2014 a rank growth of benevolence,\u2014 though for my own part I hold myself more beholden to"], [408, "The Diamond Rose. 394 George Heriot than to any other mortal, except yoursel', Euphame. I have tried to pay a small part of my debt with gifts and tokens, and I have been proud to be permitted to serve the hospital in his very wares \u2014 tankards and salvers ; and you ken we never fail to go with the bairns to see him on his birthday, standing with his flowers in his hand, and his whole house busked with posies, and to stroll in the old alleys with their young faces. But hospitals did not suit Adie and Katie, and may be, Euphame, dear friend as you were of my Lady Somerville's \u2014 now gone to her place in the sky \u2014 you've changed your mind on the point since you were so bent on being a beneficent spinster, and scattering hard-earned riches like summer flowers \u2014 eh, lass?\" \" I'm changed, Mark, and I'm not changed. After we had word that Adie, poor old Adie, was coming home to rest his crippled knee, and fight his campaigns over again in our chimney-corner, I minded of my good Lady Somerville, and her license as to discharged soldiers, or weans, or old wives, and coupled it with Cromwell's wounded"], [409, "A Family Council. 395 men, after the battle of Dunbar, lying down to rest in your ain auld princely hospital.

And perhaps the Wrichtishouse is too grand a mansion for a tradesman's retirement ; nor would I like to retire for long years to come; and maybe it would be an inconvenient distance from the shop. Trade might take a turn, or politics veer round, if the family at St. Germains were to fight their way back to their native soil, and lick his Majesty and the Duke, and the Prince of Wales. Surely I would be loth to leave our house where we set up housekeeping, and where your hair has grown dark and not white, good wife, and your -face fuller and fresher, and ne'er contracted a wrinkle.

Woe worth the man who cannot call in his wife's sense as a supplement to his wit, \u2014 who has only a fule's self-will and pride and passion to weld with his doggedness and vio lence ! I trow their work will soon fall asunder. Gude even, Euphame ; I'm for a saunter to see the lads shooting at the mark. You'll consider the question, and fix on the Wrichtishouse, or hospital or almshouse. I can trust you, my lass.\" \"Wife,\" or \" lass,\" or \" mistress \" \u2014 Mark Crichton had no other terms of endearment, but these were sacred phrases from his lips."], [411, "397 IX. EUPHAME PAYS HER VOW. T^UPHAME did meditate on the remarkable choice that was given her. She studied it in all its aspects in the dreamy summer gloaming, at the solemn midnight hour, and amid the din of everyday life. Like a wise woman, she deliberately counted the cost on each side. She saw the Wrichtishouse of the Napiers in its antique dignity and quaint picturesqueness and romantic beauty, with her old mother's admiring eyes; she conjured up the loving old woman of the Trinity; foresaw herself presiding in the Wrichtishouse; and con templated her lads beneath the stately roof-tree that had been their fathers'. Then she turned to a row of cottages out by"], [412, "The Diamond Rose. 398 Warristoun, or a tall out-of-date house once more in complete repair, and fully occupied, in one of the wynds. She looked upon men of stiff carriage, in faded uniform, smoking their pipes of peace, taking their pulls at the black-jack, and Mark moving among them of an evening, hailing them as cor dially as if they were his brother tradesmen, read ing a news print for their information, or listening to a veteran's history, strange as that of Defoe's wonderful shipwrecked mariner. She gazed anew, and perceived old women, tidy old women, in russet gowns, blue dyed aprons, snowy mutches, and tartan screens; with their bickers of porridge, their toasts of cheese or bacon, their cosy gossip, their confidential cracks ; and one of them with a glad young visitant in the person of a slip of a blooming daughter or a bouncing fellow of a son, another with a purring cat on her shoulder and a flower at her elbow, and a third \u2014 poorest of all \u2014 with a grand relation at a cool distance. She and Jenny were asking them if they were comfort able, and consulting with them on the disposal of their yarn and their hose, while little Euphame ran"], [413, "Euphame pays her Vow. 399 in and out, here and there, dropping little packets 01 snuff, sugar-candy, liquorice, or bunches of mint, sage, and marjoram. Or, again, it was a gentler Mistress Jonet, and a new edition of Euphame's young John Highland man, and a little Euphame or two, immeasur ably poor, without proud father or tender mother, sporting heedlessly among their uncouth woolly lambkins and wooden carts, about the homely but kindly matron's knee. Euphame could hesitate no longer. The Lord had lent her a goodly store. Should she not at last pay her vow to the Lord? she was an older, nobler, richer, wiser woman, and her youthful vow was so much the nobler, richer, and wiser, too. \" Mark, we are very happy as we are, why need we seek a change in our lot, provoking tempta tion, malice, and envy? We can provide for the bairns in their ain degree \u2014 the Lord bless them and keep them !\u2014 and if it be good for them, preserve for them pastures as green and waters as still as those in which they have been reared. Can we ask more, my dear man, Mark ? Let us take our spare"], [414, "The Diamond Rose. 400 gear, and build no brawer and bonnier house for ourselves, but a refuge for them that are ready to perish, and then we shall still be following the Lord, preparing for immortality, rearing a heavenly and not an earthly habitation which we shall never be wae to quit, for we ken He shall yet build it in perfection, till it fill the whole earth.\" \" Be it so, lass ; I confess I am clean of your mind, and blythe will we be at laying the foun dation, blyther than if we had been deserting our old home, our tradesman's place, which we have tried not to disparage, and cannot consent to abandon.\" So Mark Crichton and Euphame lived and died the heads of a tradesman's household. The first odour of esteem, love, and respect which their vir tues excited was never dissipated by restless change or craving efforts. Old friends were about them in their prime, old friends were with them when they were beyond the three-score and ten. Proud as tradesmen might have been of the goldsmith and his wife, they might have been still prouder"], [415, "Euphame pays her Vow. 401 themselves, of their great yet modest charities. But pride was a rank weed to them. Mark and Euphame had never a single difference about these endowments, nor, indeed, their children after them. They forgot the Wrichtishouse (long vanished), but loved to remember their father's scarred veterans, their mother's deaf old wives, their little sister Euphame's wide-mouthed, shock headed foster-sisters. Euphame would name her men, women, and children, \" My Lady Somerville's poor;\" but Mark on his tongue and in his will persisted in giving them another title, \" Euphame's People,\" \" My dear wife Euphame Napier's People.\" The chronicle is ended, and the philosophy of hospitals is untouched. To the good and thought ful, like Euphame and Mark, they are the savour of life unto life, to the light and unstable like Adie and Katie, as well as to the wicked, they are too often the savour of death unto death. But still the old bands of youths and maidens traverse the busy streets in formal lines; still they are quartered like young soldiers in their barracks;"], [416, "The Diamond Rose. 402 still the servants of the great Master work on in this field of His harvest ; and as benevolence grows rosier and brighter, and the sun rises higher and higher overhead, we are fain to hope and pray that the proportion of the Marks and Euphames may increase evermore. Farewell to Euphame, for she is rapidly fading into a ghost of the past. As she glides out of sight, we catch the last glimpse of the waiting woman and the tradesman's wife of more than a century come and gone. She holds in her hand her diamond-rose, and sheds behind her the glit tering leaves; but she bears away on her head, in an everlasting crown, the red and white roses of love human and love divine."], [417, "WARD, LOCK & CO.'S LIST OF STANDARD REFERENCE VOLUMES, POPULAR USEFUL BOOKS, Approved Educational Works, ILLUSTRATED GIFT BOOKS, &c.
