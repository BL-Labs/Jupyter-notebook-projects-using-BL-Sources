EASTER MONDAY. sTIHAT evening, Jabez, a clear-eyed, open- -'- browed youth, in bis seventeenth year, upright, well-knit, and firmly built for his age, knocked at the parlour-door after Miss Augusta had been sent to bed. There was some trouble on his counten ance, as though he was bent on an errand utterly repugnant to him. He was truly sorry to be the means, however remotely, of bringing disgrace on both an old man and a young one; but Simon had led him to the conclusion that if there was little honour VOL. II. B"], [10, "2 THE MANCHESTER MAN. in turning informer there would be absolute dishonesty in keeping silence whilst he saw his master robbed. Yet he hesitated, and lingered with his hand on the handle of the door, after the clear voice of Mr. Ashton had twice invited him to \" come in.\" Mr. Ashton therefore opened the door, and saw Jabez with a design for a bell-rope tassel in his hand. \" \"Well, Jabez \u2014 what is it ? something special you have to show us ?\" \"No, sir, I only brought this lest any of the servants should be curious about my errand here.\" Mrs. Ashton, who was reading a romance from Mrs. Edge's circulating library in King Street, lifted up her head at this ; and Jabez came in, closing the door. \" Then what is the errand which needs such precaution ?\" asked Mr. Ashton, re suming his seat and looking up at the clear face of Jabez."], [11, "3 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" I think, sir,\" \u2014 and he laid an emphasis on the \"think\" \u2014 \" I have found out how you are being robbed, and who it is that robs you.\" \" You \u2014 what ?\" exclaimed Mr. Ashton, placing his hand on the elbows of his chair, and bending forward inquiringly. Jabez repeated his statement, adding, \" I think, sir, some of your putters-out and work-people are in league to defraud vou.\" Out came Mr. Ashton's snuff-box, down went Mrs. Ashton's romance, whilst Jabez told succinctly how his suspicions had been first aroused, and how they had been con firmed that day. \" I did not tell my suspicions to Christo pher, sir, thinking I had best not interfere, or put the \u2014 the \u2014 them on their guard until I had spoken to you. I feared lest I should defeat your plans,\" said Jabez modestly. \" Just so, Jabez, just so ; you were b2"], [12, "4 THE MANCHESTER MAN. quite right, Jabez,\" said his master, whilst a shower of snuff fell on neckcloth ends and shirt-frills. \" Yes, quite right !\" assented Mrs. Ashton with customary dignity. \" ' A still tongue shows a wise head;' but we seldom see an old head on such young shoulders.\" No active steps were taken for a few days, but Mrs. Ashton was in the ware house, and doubly observant ; and Mr. Ashton was also on the alert. They saw enough to convince them that Jabez was correct, and, acting on first impulses, Nadin was again communicated with. From the window of Jabez Clegg's little room, Kit Townley was seen to receive payment from a fringe-weaver for his share of the spoil ; and then Nadin, who knew all about it quite well enough before, fol lowed up the clue to a waste-dealer's who bought at his own price workpeople's \" waste \" (i.e., warp, weft, silk, &c,"], [13, "5 THE MANCHESTER MAN. remaining after work was completed), and found tradespeople willing enough to re purchase, weU knowing that commodities so varied, and so far below market value, were not honestly come by. Nadin, big and blustering when there was nothing to be gained by silence, was for hauling the whole lot off to prison \u2014 the two Kits, the waste-dealer, and sundry workpeople \u2014 and the criminal code was a very terrible dispensation then. But Mr. Ashton was more merciful ; he was for milder measures. Besides, Mr. Townley was an old friend of his, and for the sake of the father he forbore to drag the son into a court of justice ; and unless he prosecuted all, he could not prosecute any. The sight of Nadin and his rough men, in their red-cuffed, red-collared brown coats, with their staves and hand-cuffs ready for use, was sufficently terrifying. The distress of old Mr. Townley was painful"], [14, "6 THE MANCHESTER MAN. to witness. As for Kit himself, he seemed less conscious of his guilt than ashamed of being found out, openly declaring that he \" did no more than was customary,\" and no more than old Christopher, who had led him into it, had done for years. That old hypocrite went down on his knees with many whining protestations of his innocence; but, finding proof too strong, he made a clean breast of it, and on learn ing that through the generosity of his em ployer he was about to escape prosecution, which would have led to transportation, he begged piteously to be allowed to retain the situation he had held for so many years. \" No, Kit,\" said Mrs. Ashton ; \" ' there is no rogue like an old rogue ;' you have not only robbed iis yourself, but taught others the trick. Think well you have escaped the New Bailey\" (the Manchester and Salford prison). At that period the constable who appre hended a criminal received a bonus on each"], [15, "7 THE MANCHESTER MAN. conviction, called \"blood-money,\" so large a proportion of felons were executed ; and Nadin, gruff and uncourteous even to his superiors, was disposed to resist Mr. Ash ton's amiable \"interference with the course of justice.\" A liberal douceur from Mr. Townley's well-stocked purse was potent to aUay his zeal. His runners were dismissed, and his friend the waste-dealer had a longer lease. The clearance of rogues paved the way for honest men ; besides suggesting mea sures to prevent like embezzlement in future. The Ashtons rightly thought that the best way to reward Jabez was to serve his friends. A situation as putter-out to the weavers was offered to Tom Hulme, Mr. Ashton having had his eye on him for some time ; and old Simon, being sent for, went home delighted with commendations of Jabez, and the consciousness that the only barrier to Bess's marriage was now removed, and that through the foundling's instrumentality."], [16, "8 THE MANCHESTER. MAN. The only bar, that is, save the double fees of Lent, and the \" ill-luck \" supposed to follow a couple united during the peni tential forty days. Tom put up the banns, however, and Easter Monday was chosen as the day of days for the ceremony. Tom Hu] rue's parents had been married on an Easter Monday, Simon had been tied to his wife on an Easter Monday, Jabez had been made a Blue-coat boy on an Easter Mon day, and apprenticed on an Easter Monday ; it was consequently an anniversary to be observed and respected. Early marriages prevail amongst the class made early self-dependent by earning their own living. Matt Cooper had long been a grandfather, Molly and his two eldest boys had been married and settled. A brisk young butcher coming to the tannery with hides had met Martha, the other girl, bearing her father's dinner, and been so taken with her sharp, active gait, and saucy answers, that he proposed to transfer her"], [17, "9 THE MANCHESTER MAN. to his shop beyond Ancoats Lane Canal bridge, and to make his offer more palat able, suggested an amalgamation of the two households, and to take the youngest lad \u2014 Matthew, aged fourteen \u2014 as his ap prentice. So ardent and promising a lover was not to be despised. Martha did not say \" No,\" and Matt, beginning to stoop in the shoul ders, rejoiced at the prospective haven for his declining years. It was arranged that they should be married along with Bess and Tom Hulme ; and so Matthew Cooper went with the Cleggs to church, not as a gallant bride groom, but, more suitably, to give away a bride. And now how shall I describe the scene at the Old Church on Easter Monday, to convey anything like an idea to modern readers, unacquainted with the locality, the period, and the habits of the people ? It must be borne in mind that registrars'"], [18, "10 THE MANCHESTER MAN. offices did not exist ; that there was no marrying at dissenting chapels ; that few, if any, churches were licensed for the solemnisation of matrimony ; and that the collegiate parish church of Manchester was the nucleus towards which the marriageable inhabitants of all the surrounding townships and villages turned at the most important epoch of their lives. The venerable pile (now being doctored by restorers) was set, as it were, in a ring fence of old houses, with an inner ring of low wall encircling the churchyard, which, as grave-stones testified, had once extended to the very house-steps. As I have else where said, the path between this wall and the houses was known as Half Street, a portion of which, containing Mrs. Clowes's old shop, still remains ; and did I enumer ate all the public houses in this ring-fence which offered accommodation to wedding and christening parties, only a future generation of antiquaries would thank me ;"], [19, "11 THE MANCHESTER MAN. and even they might doubt the facts set down in a work of fiction. Nevertheless on Easter Monday not one of these hostelries had a spare foot of room. Every window and every door stood wide open. Men and women, gaily dressed as their own means or friendly wardrobes would allow, went in and out, filled rooms and passages, leaned from the windows with ribbons flying loose, or with pipes and ale-pots in their hands, calling to their friends below, whilst rival fiddlers (almost every party having its own) scraped away in anything but harmony. Horses and carts blocked up every avenue, and the churchyard itself was thronged with an excited crowd. Only the parties immediately interested were admitted into the sacred edifice, but to reach the doors they had to force their way, and could only return in couples through a dense avenue of humanity, amid a shower of jests, many not the most seemly."], [20, "12 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Bess wore only a white cambric gown, and a straw bonnet crossed with white ribbon, both of which Mrs. Ashton had provided ; but somewhere in Tom's Penin sular campaigns he had picked up a bright coloured scarf, which made her glorious to behold, and the envy of many a country bride. His old uniform had been kept for the occasion, and they looked grand toge ther, but the quiet content on Bess's face was better than the grandeur. Nat Bradshaw, the butcher-bridegroom, was of a jovial turn, and nothing would do but the whole double wedding-party, Jabez included, should turn into the Ring-o'-Bells to drink health and happi ness to the brides, and give them spirit to go through the ceremony befittingly. Bess and Martha hung back, blushing like peonies ; but Nathaniel was not to be gain said, and in they went ; and whilst the brides sipped, he quaffed, and pressed the others to do likewise."], [21, "13 THE MANCHESTER MAN. At length Jabez, who had been brought up temperately, cried out they would be too late \u2014 Parson Brookes had been gone into the church half-an-hour. There was a general rush from the room, and in the scramble to get first the party got separated, Matthew pulling his daughter along and leaving the bridegroom to follow. They elbowed their way into the church, and reached the choir just as Joshua pro nounced the benediction over some twenty couples closely packed around the altar. Then there was a jostle and a scramble for \" first kisses,\" amidst which rose the rough voice of the chaplain. \" Now clear out, clear out ! Do your kissing outside. There are other folk waiting to be wed. Do you think I want to be kept here all day tying up fools ?\" That instalment of the married having been hustled away to sign the church books, with their attendant witnesses, Joshua called out impatiently to the wait-"], [22, "14 THE MANCHESTER MAN. ing couples, amongst which were Bess and Tom\u2014 \" Come, come ! How long do you mean to keep me standing here ? Do you intend to be married or not ? Oh, it's thee, is it ? [to Bess]. Well, thah's waited long enough. \u2014 See that you make her a good husband [to Tom]. Kneel down here,\" and he placed them, not roughly, almost in the centre of the altar, pulling others to their knees beside them, with scant ceremony. \" What do you want here ?\" in his harshest tones he asked a very youthful looking couple. \" To be wed,\" was the prompt answer of the young man. \"Ugh!\" grunted the Parson, \"what's the world coming to ? I used to marry men and women \u2014 now I marry children ! Here, you silly babies, take your places.\" Another file of candidates for matrimony being ranged (after some pushing and pulling) in pairs around the altar, Joshua"], [23, "15 THE MANCHESTER MAN. took his book, and the service bearan. 7 O So long as it was general, all went tolerably smoothly \u2014 women and men alike were too bashful and confused to know much what was said, or what they re sponded, and certainly they rarely looked in each other's faces. At length there was a slight stir and a whispering from the quarter where Matt Cooper stood behind his daughter. \" Silence there !\" roared Joshua, in a voice which set a row of hearts in a flutter, and there was silence. But he had come to the troth-plight, and again the same commotion was apparent as he approached the Coopers. \" \"What's wrong here ?\" he demanded, pausing before Martha, who was all in a tremble. \" Moi lass is waitin' fur her mon,\" an swered Matthew from behind. \" Ugh !\u2022 I can't wait for laggards. \u2014 \"Here, you, [addressing Tom Hulme,] an-"], [24, "16 THE MANCHESTER MAN. swer for him. \u2014 \"What's his name ?\" [to Martha]. \" Nathaniel,\" she faltered. \" I, Nathaniel, take thee, Martha, to be my \" he went on, insisting on the response of Tom, who looked aghast at the prospect of marrying the wrong woman, and being told \"to pair as they went out,\" as Joshua had summarily adjusted a like mistake heretofore ; or what was worse, of being saddled with two wives. On imperturbable Joshua went with the ceremony, bent on a marriage by proxy. His experience having taught him that women of the working class as a rule took charge of their wedding-rings, he asked Martha for hers, which was duly produced, and without further ado he directed Tom Hulme to place it on Martha's finger, as he had pre viously put one on Bess's, and with the same formula. They had got as far as \" \"With this ring I thee wed,\" when the missing bridegroom"], [25, "17 THE MANCHESTER MAN. came in hot haste through the side door, into the chancel, closely followed by Jabez, who had been in quest of him. He was flushed with ale and excitement, but was clear-headed enough to perceive what was going forward, and, to the chaplain's chagrin, plucked the young woman back from the altar and his proxy, and the ring rolled to the ground. Then ensued an altercation between the butcher and Joshua Brookes, the latter in sisting that what was good enough for princes might be good enough for him, and refusing to go over the ceremony again. But an apparitor drew the tardy bride groom aside, and whispered to him a few mollifying words, whilst Joshua concluded the ceremonial, and then hurried from the altar with hardly a look at either Jabez or Simon as he passed out of the chancel, chafed and angry. Another clergyman took his place, and in the next group Nat Bardsley and the half-married Martha took VOL. II. c"], [26, "18 THE MANCHESTER MAN. theirs. The lost ring had a substitute provided by the clerk for such emergen cies; and this time they were as surely married as Bess and Tom had been. Jabez had found the truant bridegroom at the \" Ring-o'-Bells,\" oblivious of the flight of time, or of his party. The story having got wind, there was a general rush in their direction. \" Here's th' mon wur too late to be wed !\" \u2014 \" Tak' care thi woife hasna two husbants !\" \u2014 \" Hoo's getten two husbants o' ready !\" \u2014 \" See thah's tied oop gradely, lass !\"\u2014 \" Thah'rt a pratty fellow!\" and much more which might have provoked a man less good-humoured in his cups. As it was the new brides clung to their husbands, half afraid of these noisy demon strations, and were not sorry to get clear of the crowd, and thread their way to Ancoats Lane, where the thriving butcher, assisted by Mrs. Ashton, Mrs. Clowes, and"], [27, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 19 Mrs. Clough, had prepared a dinner which bore no proportion to the \" short commons \" of every-day fare.

But the war had been of too long continuance, too universal, too destructive of life and property and crops. \"When grounds lie untilled for years ; when swords reap harvests that should have been left for the sickle ; when cattle are slaughtered wholesale for unpro ductive soldiery, or for lack of provender ; when orchards and vineyards which have taken years to mature are given to the"], [29, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 21 flames, there can be no sudden re-adjust ment of commercial matters.

Trade could not revive until there was food to sustain it. Yet the mass of the people in 1816, still further im poverished by a deficient home-harvest, imputed the evil to defective legislation, and the exclusion of foreign corn save at famine prices ; and discontent became universal. Strangely enough, the agricultural dis tricts, which the Corn Laws were supposed to protect, were the first to cry out against them, and to break out into riot \u2014 not Manchester, Oldham, Nottingham, and the manufacturing centres."], [30, "22 THE MANCHESTER MAN. This year closed on a popular demand for Parliamentary reform, but not a riotous one. Sunday-schools had created readers on humble hearths, and William Cobbett supplied them with books and pamphlets bearing on their own rights and wrongs. They were read with avidity, and he be came a power. He counselled peaceful persistence, not armed resistance. Hamp den Clubs were formed all over the country, in which the political questions of the day were discussed with as much freedom as stringent law permitted. Public speakers and poets, of whom Samuel Bamford was one, arose from the ranks of the working classes ; and the men banded together under such leadership caUed themselves Radical Reformers, a title which soon degenerated into Radicals. The members of these rapidly-spreading clubs subscribed a penny a week each. Delegates were sent to meet and debate together; and on the 4th November, 1816,"], [31, "23 THE MANCHESTER MAN. a large meeting was held in St. Peter's Field, Manchester (strangely enough, the site of the present Free Trade Hall), \" to take into consideration the distressed state of the country.\" Other meetings were held by the Re formers and their delegates; and on the 13th January, 1817, their political opponents held a counter-meeting, to consider the \" necessity of adopting measures for the maintenance of the public peace ;\" for certainly the meeting of large masses of disaffected people, however peaceably dis posed in the outset, and individually, becomes threatening in the aggregate. No one cares much for a grain of gunpowder ; but mass the grains into pounds, and the pounds into tons, and there is certainly need of precaution in dealing with it. Amongst the precautionary measures deemed necessary for the protection of the peace, and the suppression of seditious meetings, were the suspension of the"], [32, "24 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Habeas Corpus Act, and the enrolment of the Manchester and Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry, under the command of Sir T. J. Trafford ; Laurence Aspinall, Ben Travis, and John Walmsley joining the corps. Ou the 24th of March \u2014 since known as Blanket Monday \u2014 a large number of men assembled in St. Peter's Field, with blankets upon their shoulders, with the openly expressed design of walking to London, to lay their grievances before George, the Prince Regent, in person. The blankets were intended for coverlets on the wayside beds Mother Earth alone would spread for them. The meeting was dispersed by military, the newly-formed yeomanry dis tinguishing themselves by trapping a num ber of the Blanketeers who had prematurely set out, and who had not got farther than Stockport. This was the signal for wide-spread alarm, and for Joseph Nadin to prove his discrimination and vigilance by scenting"], [33, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 25 out imaginary plots, and arresting suspect ed plotters, whom he tied together, hand cuffed, ill-used, and hauled to prison, or before magistrates (whether for acquittal or conviction), for little other reason than the dangerous power given by the suspen sion of the Habeas Corpus. He was a big, blustering, overbearing fellow, with a large grizzled head, closely set on strong broad shoulders, with overhanging brows drawn close, and a saUow skin ; and his officious zeal in arresting such persons as Samuel Bamford, the weaver-poet, Thomas Walker, and the amateur actors he laid hands on at a public-house in Ancoats Lane, laying to their charge plots which had their origin in his own brain, did more to embitter the people against their rulers than those dust-blinded rulers suspected.

Popular rights had found a fresh champion in Henry Hunt, the son of a well-descended Wiltshire yeoman, a man of gentlemanlike bearing and attire, agreeable features mobile in expression, and dull grey eyes which lit like fiery stars when in the fervour of his speech his soul shone out of them. \" Orator Hunt,\" as he was ironically dubbed by those who loved him not, was the very man to move the people as he himself was moved ; his energy and fervid eloquence carried his hearers with him, and as he was wont to lash himself to a fury which streaked his pale eyes with blood, and forced them forward in their sockets, no wonder the Manchester mag nates were afraid of his influence on the multitude, or that the Prince Regent should issue a proclamation against sedi tious meetings and writings, or the military drilling of the populace, then carried on with so fervid an orator to inflame them."], [35, "27 THE MANCHESTER MAN. When Henry Hunt made a public entry into Manchester, and attended the theatre the same evening, a disturbance ensued, and he was expelled, and the next evening the theatre was closed, to preserve peace.

Augusta Ashton had just passed her fif teenth birthday. She was slim, graceful, and tall beyond her age, and was surpass ingly lovely.

About that hour the people began to assemble from all quarters on the open ground near St. Peter's Church \u2014 not blood thirsty roughs, but men, women, and children, drawn thither for a sight of a holiday spectacle. True, of the coHective eighty thousand, though there were many thousands of earnest, thinking men who went to grapple with important questions, yet no such mighty gathering could be without its leaven of savagery and mischief. But those who went from the mills and the workshops, the hills and the valleys around Manchester, walking in procession, with bugles playing and gay banners flying, though they might look haggard, pinched, and careworn, made no attempt to look deplorable, or excite compassion. They wore their Sunday suits and clean neckties ; and by the side of fustian and corduroy walked the coloured prints and stuffs of"], [37, "THE MANCHESTER MAN; 29 wives and sweethearts, who went as for a gala-day, to break the dull monotony of their lives, and to serve as a guarantee of peaceable intention.

Women and little ones pre ceded them, or ran on the footway, sing ing, dancing, shouting gleefully in the bright sunshine, as at any other pageant to which the music of the bugle gave life and spirit, and waving flags gave colour. Such too were the bands which, with banners and music, fell in with them on their route, and together parted the dense multitude as a wedge, on their way to the decorated platform. Thence Samuel Bam ford observed that other leaders had been"], [38, "30 THE MANCHESTER MAN. less temperate.

But ere he could well note or deplore this, the scattered bands struck up \" God save the King,\" and \" Rule, Britannia,\" deafening shouts rent the air, and Henry Hunt, drawn in an open barouche by white horses, made his way slowly to the hust tings amidst the enthusiastic cheering of the multitude. A Mrs. Fildes, arrayed in white, with a cap of liberty on her head, and a red cap borne on a pole before her, sat on the box-seat. It is said she had been hoisted there from the crowd. Be this as it may, she paid dearly for her temerity before the day was out."], [39, "31 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Barely had Henry Hunt ascended the platform, taken off his white hat, and begun to address his attentive auditory, when there was a startling cry, \" The soldiers are upon us !\" and the 15th Hussars, gallop ing round a corner, came with their spare jackets flying loose, their sabres drawn, and threw themselves, men and horse, upon the closely packed mass, without a note of warning. All had been preconcerted, pre arranged. From the early morning, magistrates had been sitting in conclave at the \" Star Inn,\" and there Hugh Birley, a cotton-spinner, was said to have regaled too freely the officers and men of his yeomanry corps, so soon to be let loose on the \" swinish multi tude,\" as they caUed them. A cordon of military and yeomanry had been drawn round St. Peter's Field, like a horde of wolves round a flock of sheep. The boroughreeve and other magistrates issued their orders from a house at the"], [40, "32 THE MANCHESTER MAN. corner of Mount Street, which overlooked the scene ; and thence (not from a central position, where he could be properly seen and heard) a clerical magistrate read the Riot Act from a window in an inaudible voice. Then Nadin, the cowardly bully, having a warrant to apprehend the ringleaders \u2014 although he had a line of constables thence to the hustings, \u2014 declared he dared not serve it without the support of the military. His plea was heard ; and thus, through the blindness, the incapacity, the coward ice, or the self-importance of this one man, soldiery hardened in the battle-field, yeomanry fired with drink, were let loose like barbarians on a closely-wedged mass of unarmed people, and one of the most atrocious massacres in history was the result. Amid the shouts and shrieks of men and women, cries of \" Shame ! shame !\" \" Break !"], [41, "33 THE MANCHESTER MAN. break !\" \" They are killing them in front !\" \" Break ! break !\" hussars, infantry, yeo manry rushed on the defenceless people. They were sabred, stabbed, shot, pressed down, trampled down by horse and infan try ; and in less than ten minutes, the actual field was cleared of all but mounds of dead and dying, severed limbs, torn garments, pools of blood, pawing steeds, and panting heroes (?). Men and maidens, mothers and babes, had been butchered by their own countrymen for no crime. Hunt had been taken, Bamford had escaped \u2014 to be arrested afterwards \u2014 and Mrs. Fildes, hanging suspended by a nail in the platform which had caught her white dress, was slashed across her exposed body by one of the brave cavalry. But the butchery and the panic had spread from the deserted Aceldama over the whole town; and the roar of cannon began to add its thunder to the terrors of the day. As the first shrieking fugitives VOL. II.

On the stairs she met Jabez in a state of equal excitement. \"Miss Augusta! Is she at school? Had I not better \" \" Oh, yes ! Run ! run !\" cried the mother, anticipating him. \" Go through the back streets, and take her to her aunt's. It is not safe to bring her home.\" He was gone before she concluded.

From Back Mosley Street he tore down Rook Street and Meal Street, into Fountain Street, across Market Street \u2014 already in a ferment \u2014 and onward down High Street without a pause.

Upstairs rushed Augusta, followed by her friend, in search of her aunt and cousin, whom she found in the drawing-room in a state of the greatest trepidation and alarm. Dolly, a stout woman-servant, had gone to Fountain Street, as was her custom, to assist her paralysed master home to dinner.

Personal danger was unthought of when Augusta Ashton pointed to needful service.

The sights and sounds that met her eyes and ears were terrible : gashed faces and maimed limbs ; appeals and imprecations mingled with the roar of a surging crowd ; the dropping fire of musketry ; the coarse shouts of the yeomanry, drunk with wine and blood ! As her fearful eyes followed Jabez, a man rushed past whose hand had been chopped off at the wrist. With the remaining hand he held his hat to catch the vital stream which gushed from the bleeding stump ; and as he ran, he cried, \" Blood for blood ! blood for blood !\" in a tone which made her shudder.

Augusta and her friend, with blanched cheeks and lips, were also at the window, fascinated as it were with that which chilled them. Jabez turned the corner into Piccadilly, where one or two good houses had been converted into shops witout lowering the floors, or removing the original palisades which enclosed bold flights of steps leading to doors with good shop-windows on each side. A confectioner of some stand ing named Mabbott occupied the second of these. He and his neighbour were hurriedly putting up their shutters as Jabez, crushing his way through the thickening crowd, saw Molly and Mr. Chadwick jammed up against the pali sades, a young mounted yeomanry officer, in all his pride of blue and silver, brandish-"], [47, "39 THE MANCHESTER MAN. ing his sabre, urging his unwilling steed upon them, and shouting \u2014 \"Move on, you rebels, move on ! or I'll cut you down !\" Strong of nerve and will, Jabez thrust the impeding throng aside, and grasped the horse's reins to force it back, crying as he did so \u2014 \" Shame, you coward ! to attack a woman and a paralysed man !\" \" Come in here, quick, Mr. Chadwick !\" cried Mr. Mabbott at that instant, opening his closed gate and drawing the feeble gentleman and his attendant within, as the sabre, raised either to terrify or strike the old man, came down on the outstretched arm of Jabez, gashing it frightfully. Another of the corps riding past, with his eyes full upon them, stopped his horse at the gallop as if to interpose, but he was too late. \"My God!

I do wish father had come home !\" and Ellen turned a worried look towards Mrs. Chadwick, whose rigid face and clasped hands betrayed the anxiety which kept her silent. Augusta, though not naturally void of feeling, longed to know more of the hand some yeomanry officer who had so capti vated her young fancy ; but that was not the season for such inquiries, and she was conscious of it. \" Hark ! what is that ?\" burst from Mrs. Chadwick, some half -hour later, as the sound of feet was heard from below ; and Ellen, rushing to the stairs, came back foUowed by her father leaning on the arm of a big muscular man, in the blue and silver uniform of the yeomanry cavalry, a red cord down his pantaloons, hessian boots, and, to make assurance sure, M.S.Y.C. ivpon the shako which his height compelled him to doff ere he entered the doorway. \" Where is Jabez Clegg ?\" faltered Ellen,"], [51, "43 THE MANCHESTER MAN. as she pressed to her father's side, led him to his chair, and placed his cushions to his liking, Augusta bringing a buffet on which to rest his foot.

The main streets were unsafe, so he also took the back way, and across Back-Piccadilly to Mr. Mabbott's, with a celerity scarcely to have been expected, for he was not a young man. But his ap prentice had won upon him not only by his integrity and business qualifications, but by his manifest interest in the family he served, especially the daughter. Let me not be misunderstood. Augusta was the cynosure of Mr. Ashton's eyes ; the homage of the apprentice to the school-girl, he estimated as the homage of an apprentice merely, and was gratified thereby, but had no thought beyond.

His uniform was a protection, and so the doctors told him; Dr. Hardie plainly saying that black cloth was not plate-armour, and that his friend, whoever he might be, must wait until the tumult had somewhat subsided. But Jabez was only a few hours without attention.

As the flying crowd, dispers ing, left bare St. Peter's Field, pressing outward and onwards through all accessible ramifications, the main thoroughfares * See Appendix."], [57, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 49 thinned, and the scene of action took a wider radius. Still the gallant hussars and yeomanry went prancing through these thorough fares, dashing hither and thither, slashing at stragglers, shouting to the rebels, and to each other, to \" clear the way \" ; driving curious and and anxious spectators from doors and windows, and firing at refractory outstretched heads. To clear the streets more effectually, cannon were planted at the entrances of the leading outlets from the town, and, as if that were not enough, the artillery had orders to fire. At New Cross two of these guns (which went rattling up Oldham Street, to the dismay of Augusta and the Chadwicks, as well as their neighbours) were posted, one with its hard iron mouth directed up Newton Lane, the other set to sweep Ancoats Lane, not then so wide as at present.

His route from the tannery lay in a straight line up Miller's Lane, past Shude Hill Pits, and the New Cross, into Ancoats Lane, which he crossed the Market to reach only just before the cannon lumbered up.

The streets grew silent and deserted, save by the military and medical men, as the day and the night advanced ; but with in the houses of poor and rich there were loud complaints, and groans, and murmur ings, which did not sink to silence with the day that called them forth. The town was, as it were, in a state of siege ; and men of business, whether Tories or Radicals, alike felt the stoppage of trade and commerce in their pockets, whether they felt the cruelty and injustice to the injured in their hearts or not. But chiefly those who had friends wounded by design or accident in the melee were loud in their denunciation of the whole proceedings ; and of these neither Mr. Chadwick nor Mr. Ashtion was the least prominent, even though the one was paralysed, and they were of contrary shades of politics, the former being what he himself called \"a staunch and true out-and-out Tory,\" the latter having a"], [62, "54 THE MANCHESTER MAN. leaning towards Liberal \u2014 not to say Radi cal \u2014 opinions, and at county elections voting1 with the Whigs.

In his own person he had witnessed how the actual breakers of the peace were those commissioned to preserve it. In the wanton attack on himself, an unarmed, defenceless, disabled old man, he recognised the general characteristics of the whole affair, and entered his protest against so lawless an exposition of the law. He was himself a peaceable man, a loyal subject, going quietly about his own business when Jabez intercepted, to his own hurt, the sabre destined for his grey head. Matthew Cooper, his tenant's son-in-law, was as peaceable and well-disposed ; and if so, might not the bulk of the so-called rebels have been the same ? In his gratitude to"], [64, "56 THE MANCHESTER MAN.

Easy-going Mr. Ashton also seemed transformed by the event. He had cer tainly lost the valuable services of his apprentice for some time to come ; but that was the very least ingredient in the cup of his wrath. By faithful, intelligent service ; by persevering industry, by a thousand little actions which had shown his interest in his employers, and his devo tion to his old friends, Jabez had won a place in his master's esteem and affection no other apprentice of any grade had ever attained. And now that Jabez had risked the"], [65, "57 THE MANCHESTER MAN. dangers of the soldier-ridden street to bear his beloved daughter to a place of safety, and had braved the storm of foot and horse, and fire and steel, to rescue his brother-in-law by endangering his own life or limbs, his admiration and gratitude rose to their highest, and in proportion his denunciation of an outrage which called for such a sacrifice, was strong and vehe ment \u2014 all the more that he sympathised with the objects of the meeting. When he and Simon Clegg (who had been drawn to the scene in his dinner-hour with others, like moths to a candle) picked up his cavalry friend, Robert Hindley, from amongst the building materials, and disen gaged him from his dead horse, he could not refrain from telling the disabled warrior, with all a friend's frankness, that \" it served him right !\" Open expression of private opinion on the conduct of rulers was dangerous at that period, as may be supposed ; but private"], [66, "58 THE MANCHESTER MAN. opinion now became public opinion, too strong and too universal to be put in fetters. Mr. Tyas, the Times reporter, had been taken prisoner on the hustings, and it was imagined that only a one-sided account \u2014 forwarded by the magistracy in justification of their conduct \u2014 would reach London. But other intelligent reporters were at large, the garbled statements sent to the Government press were confuted by the truth-telling narratives of Messrs. Archibald Prentice and John Edward Taylor, which appeared the following day, and roused the indignation of the realm. These state ments being more than substantiated by the Times reporter on his liberation, national indignation rose to a ferment. This alarmed the Manchester magis trates; a meeting was hurriedly arranged to take place on Thursday, the 19th (the third day from Peterloo), at the Police Station ; thence adjourned to the \" Star Inn,\" in Deansgate ; and, as though the"], [67, "59 THE MANCHESTER MAN. meeting had been a public one, resolutions were passed thanking magistrates and soldiers for their services on the previous Monday. Then Manchester rose, as it were, en masse, to vindicate its own honour, and reject participation in a disgraceful deed. \" A declaration,\" says one historian, \" was issued, protesting against the ' Star Inn ' resolutions, which in the course of two or three days received close upon five thousand signatures,\" in obtaining which none were more active than Mr. Ashton and (despite his paralysis) Mr. Chad wick. Old Mrs. Clowes talked her cus tomers into signing, and Parson Brookes was not idle.

They did not feel \"thankful \" to the magis trates for the blood shed on Peterloo Mon day. Neither did the bulk of the inhabitants ; and an energetic protest against the pro ceedings and representations of the magis tracy was the result. To counteract this, the Prince Begent, through his mouthpiece Lord Sidmouth, sent his thanks to the magistrates and the military leaders for \" their prompt, decisive, and efficient measures.\" But this, instead of calming, lashed the public mind to frenzy. Meetings to remonstrate with the Begent and to petition for inquiry were held in all the large towns, Sir Francis Burdett presiding at one held in West minster. Subscriptions were also got up for the relief of such wounded and disabled per sons as had crept into holes and corners to hide themselves and their wounds from Nadin and his constabulary ; and here, too,"], [69, "61 THE MANCHESTER MAN.

S.\" in the subscription list represented the mite of the Grammar School head-master, but I could not take an affidavit on the subject. But when the wounded, so far as ascertained, amounted to six hundred, irrespective of the killed, subscriptions had need to be many and ample. Another token of the change in public sentiment was shown in the satires and pasquinades which appeared on the walls, or were distributed from hand to hand. Previous to Peterloo, a set of anonymous verses in ridicule of the popular leader had been distributed.

He was per fectly conscious when Mr. Mabbott hastily cut away the sleeve of his jacket, and bound the wounded arm as tightly as towels could bind.

And then he would have closed his eyes for very weariness, but a little soft warm hand stole into his feeble one, and thrilling through him, a faint tinge chased the death ly pallor from his face as Augusta's voice, full of commiseration, said apologetically, \"I had no idea, Jabez, that I was sending you into danger when I asked you to look for Uncle Chadwick ; I am so sorry you have been hurt.\" He held the little hand of his master's daughter for one or two delicious minutes, while he answered feebly \u2014 \" Never mind, Miss Ashton ; I was only too glad to be there in time ;\" and lapsed into so ethereal a dream as he released it, that the low, broken, grateful thanks of Ellen Chadwick left but the impression on his mind that she was very much in earnest, and had called him Mr. Clegg. Mr. Clegg ! When had the College-boy \u2014 the Blue-coat apprentice \u2014 been anything but Jabez Clegg ? Mr. Clegg ! It was"], [83, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 75 from such lips social recognition, and so blent strangely with his dream. Ah ! could he but have known how much of latent tenderness was embodied in those incoherent expressions of a daughter's gratitude, or that the speaker dared not trust her faltering tongue with his Christian name ! Mrs. Ashton called the young ladies away. \" My dears, you had better resume your occupations, and leave Jabez to repose ; it is not well to crowd about an invalid on so sultry a day as this.\" So Miss Chadwick went, with her tatting shuttle, back to her seat by the one window where the friendly shade of the dove-coloured curtains screened from ob servation any glances which might chance to stray from the tatting to the sofa ; and Miss Ashton went back to her music-stool, where the sunbeams, falling through the other window, lit up her lovely profile,"], [84, "76 THE MANCHESTER MAN. shot a glint of gold through her hair, and showed the dimples in her white shoulder to the half-shut, dreaming eyes of Jabez, who listened, entranced, as she practised scales and battle-pieces, waltzes and qua drilles, totally unconscious that she was feeding a fever in the soul of the apprentice more to be feared than the stroke of Aspinall' s sabre, though it had cut into the bone. Not that she was a simple school-girl, and ignorant of the power of beauty. She was pretty well as romantic as any girl of that romantic age who, being fifteen, looked a year older, and learned the art of fascination from the four volume novels of the period. Mrs. Ashton herself subscribed to the fashionable circu lating library of the town, but she was somewhat choice in her reading, and had Miss Augusta stopped where her mother did she would have done well. But it so happened that, after feasting on the whole-"], [85, "77 THE MANCHESTER MAN. some peas her mother provided, she fell with avidity on husks obtained surreptiti ously elsewhere. Kisses from Augusta could always coax coins from papa, and as a Miss Bohanna kept open a well-known, well-stocked circulating library in Shude hill, albeit in a cellar, its contiguity to Bradshaw Street and Mrs. Broadbent's enabled Miss Ashton (or Cicely for her) to smuggle in amongst her school-books other fictions, such as Elizabeth Helme and Anna Maria Boche used to concoct, and George Bichardson provided, to delight our grandmothers with. So Miss Ashton was quite prepared to be admired and play the heroine prema turely; but she had been reared in the same house with Jabez, had been caressed and waited upon by him as a child, and anything so absurd as her father's appren tice falling in love with her had never dawned upon her apprehension. Then not even his wounded arm could make"], [86, "78 THE MANCHESTER MAN. him handsome enough for a hero, so she plunged through the \" Battle of Prague,\" and \" Lodoiska,\" and glided into the \" Copenhagen Waltz,\" with no suspicion of a listener more than ordinary. Mrs. Ashton, who was back-stitching a shirt-wristband (family linen was then made at home), imagined that Jabez was dozing, and, unwilling to disturb him, only spoke when a false note, or a passage out of time, called for a low-voiced hint to her daughter, or when she found occasion to make some slight observation to the equally silent Ellen. Presently the clock in the hall proclaimed \"five.\" Miss Ashton closed music-books and piano; Miss Chadwick completed a loop, then put her tatting away in a small, oblong, red morocco reticule ; Mrs. Ashton laid the wristband in her workbasket, which she put out of sight in a panelled cupboard within the wall, sheathed the scissors hanging from her girdle, folded up"], [87, "79 THE MANCHESTER MAN. the leather housewife containing her cut skeins of thread, &c. ; James brought in the tea-board, with its genuine China tea service, plates with cake and bread-and butter, and, whilst he went back to Kezia for the tea-urn, in walked Mr. Ashton, and with him the Bev. Joshua Brookes. One might have supposed his first salutation would have been to the lady of the house. Nothing of the kind ! With a passing nod to Mrs. Ashton, who had extended her hand, he marched straight to the sofa, and greeted its occupant with \u2014 \" Well, young Cheat-the-fishes, so you've been in the wars again.\" \" Yes, sir,\" said Jabez, attempting to rise. \"Lie still, lad! And so you thought a velveteen jacket defensive armour against sharpened steel ?\" \"I never thought about it, sir.\" \" Ugh ! Then I suppose you reckoned a young man's arm worth less than an old man's head ! Eh ?\""], [88, "80 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Jabez smiled. \" Certainly, sir !\" \" Humph ! I thought as much !\" Then, darting a keen inquisitive glance from under his shaggy eyebrows at the prostrate young fellow, he added in his very raspiest tones, \"And I daresay you've no notion whose sabre carved the wing of the goose so cleverly ?\" What little blood was left in his body seemed to mount to the face of Jabez, the old scar on his brow \u2014 which every year made less conspicuous \u2014 purpled and grew livid. Old Joshua needed no more. \"Ah, I see you do! Well, are you inclined to forgive the fellow this time ?\" All ears were on the alert. Jabez caught the quick turn of his kind master's head. He hesitated, paled, and flushed again. Joshua Brookes waited. There was some indecision in the reply when it did come. \" I am not sure, sir. But he was very"], [89, "81 THE MANCHESTER MAN. drunk. I don't think he would have done it if he had been sober.\" \"Just so, Jabez \u2014 just so !\" assented Mr. Ashton with evident satisfaction, and a tap on his snuff-box-lid. Ben Travis had revealed the name of Mr. Chadwick's assailant to the manu facturer, and he to the chaplain. \" Oh ! that's your opinion, is it ?\" cried the latter, crustily, wheeling sharply round to disguise a smile. \u2014 \" Here, madam, let's have a cup of sober tea after that !\" \" I think, Mr. Brookes,\" said Mrs. Ash ton, as she seated herself, \" with all due deference to you \u2014 I think you ask too much from Jabez.

For my own part, I should be loth to let the same stick beat me twice. Our apprentice has borne quite too much from that fellow \" (she waxed indignant), \" and there is a limit to forgiveness.\" \" Yes, madam,\" answered the Parson snappishly, \" there is a limit to forgiveness ; but the limit is 'not seven times, but seventy times seven !\" There was no more to be said. The rough chaplain spoke with authority, and from experience, and Jabez knew it."], [91, "83 CHAPTEB V. MR. CLEGG !

In his helpless condition he required attention, which she could not condescend to render personally ; yet she was as little inclined to delegate the duty to Kezia, who was never over well-disposed towards him, and who might have resented the call to \"wait on a prentice lad;\" or to Cicily, who was too young to have the run of a young man's chamber.

Yet the apprentice never again sank into the old ruts. His bed in the attic was turned over to his successor. From that parlour where he had lain and listened to Augusta's music, and Parson Brookes's dictum ; where Mrs. Ashton had placed his pillows, and Ellen Chadwick had supplied his wants with such intuitive perception at tea-time ; from that room he went to a chamber on an upper floor, furnished neatly but plainly, with due regard to comfort. There was a mahogany camp-bedstead, draped with chintz of most extraordinary device. The bed was of feathers \u2014 not"], [93, "85 THE MANCHESTER MAN. flock. An oak chest of drawers, which did duty for a dressing-table, stood by the win dow, which itself overlooked the yard, and on the top stood a small oval swing looking glass. There were small strips of carpet along the two sides of the bed, which did not touch the wall; an almost triangular washstand in one corner, and near the middle of the room a rush-bottom chair and a tripod table. There was also a cushioned easy-chair, which had a suggest iveness of being there for that special occasion only ; and Jabez, who on his first glance around began to speculate whether the whole would not vanish with his con valescence, was reassured when he saw that his wooden box had been brought from the attic and stood against the wall. The six-foot, bronzed, bearded man of forty remains a child to the mother who bore him, or the woman who nursed him. And as she had laid him in his cradle when a baby, Bess helped Jabez to his new bed,"], [94, "86 THE MANCHESTER MAN. fed him with the beef-tea which Kezia had prepared (for a wonder, without a grum ble), gave him the cooling draught Mr. Huertley had sent in, smoothed his pillows for repose, and kissed his brow, with a \" God bless thee !\" much as she had done when he was an ailing child, but with all the access of motherliness her own mater nity had given. Nevertheless he did not sleep readily. Neither Bessy's soothing hand nor the soft bed superinduced slumber. He was modest, and \"Mr. Clegg\" haunted him. He could not see the connection between his impulsive rush forward to check the yeoman's plunging steed, and his employer's recognition of the service rendered. \" I only did my duty,\" he debated with himself, as he lay there, with a mere streak of light from the glimmering rushlight show ing between the closely-drawn curtains\u2014 \" I only did my duty.

But I never thought of the sword, not I. I only thought of poor old Mr. Chadwick and Molly ; and I'm sure Mr. Mabbott's ready hand did as good service as mine. Only I happened to get hurt.

How fond she must be of her father, from the way she thanked me!\" (Ah, Jabez ! what oculist can cure blind ness such as thine ?) If less consecutive, still in some such current ran the young man's thoughts, until chaos came, and his closed eyes saw innumerable Mr. Cleggs written on walls, and floor, and curtains, and a delicious symphony seemed to chorus the words, and \" lap him in Elysium.\" After that, once each day Mrs. Ashton paid him a brief visit of inspection and inquiry, generally timed so as to meet the surgeon. Mr. Ashton, with less of cere mony, dropped in occasionally, to bring"], [97, "89 THE MANCHESTER MAN. him a newspaper, book, or pamphlet to beguile the hours, and was not above loitering for a pleasant chat on matters in doors and out, the state of political feeling, and of business, in a manner so friendly Jabez was at a loss to account for it. Once or twice Augusta tapped at the door, to ask if Jabez was better, ancl to \"hope he would soon be well,\" and the simple words ran through his brain with a thousand chimerical meanings. Joshua Brookes paid him . a couple of visits, brought him papers of sweetmeats and messages from Mrs. Clowes, and a Latin Testament and a worn \u00c6neid from his own stores, as a little light reading. Mrs. Chadwick, too, made her appearance at his bedside, with kindly and grateful words from her husband ; and amongst them he was in a fah^ way of becoming elevated into a hero to his own hurt. Simon Clegg (who pulled off his thick Sunday shoes in the kitchen, and went up-"], [98, "90 THE MANCHESTER MAN. stairs in his stocking feet, lest he should make a clatter, and spoil the carpets) counteracted the mischief, and somewhat clipped the pinions of soaring imagination. Jabez, his arm bandaged and sustained by a sling, lay with his head against the straight, high back of his padded chair, between the window and the fireplace, which glowed, not with live coals, but a beau-pot of sunflowers and hollyhocks from Simon's garden. At his feet lay little Sim, fast asleep, w-ith his fat arms round the neck of Nelson, the black retriever, which had somehow contrived to sneak past Kezia with his tail between his legs, and to follow Bess up-stairs, where he had estab lished himself in perfect content. \u2022 Simon greeted his foster- son with bated breath, awed no doubt by the lamp-bearing statues in hall and staircase, and hardly raised his voice above a whisper while he stayed.

Jabez himself, being still feeble, had spoken but little. \"Moi lad,\" said he, \"this is a grand place, but dunnot yo' let it mak' yo preawd; an' aw hope as yo're thankful yo' han fallen among sich koind folk.\" \"Indeed I am.\" \" Yo' did nowt but whatn wur yo'r duty, moi lad, as aw trust thah allays wilt ; and thah's getten a mester and missis i' ten theawsand, to mak' so mich on a cut in a 'prentice's arm \u2014 ay, tho it ivur got i' savin' one o' theer own kin !

Neither was he again invited to join the family, Mrs. Ashton having ob jected to Mr. Ashton's proposition. \" It would lift the young man out of his sphere, William, and do him more harm than good. Only very strong heads can stand sudden elevation ; and it is well to make no more haste than good speed.\" But Mr. Ashton's \" Just so \" was less definite than ordinary, and he took a second"], [101, "93 THE MANCHESTER MAN. pinch of snuff unawares, with a prolonged emphasis, which supplied the place of words. To the observant Mr. Ashton's snuff-box contained as much eloquence as did Lord Burleigh's celebrated wig. He had taken a liking to the lad from the first, paid very little deference to Mrs. Grundy, and gave Jabez credit for a stronger head than did his more cautious and philosophic lady. Yet Jabez, to his surprise, found that his little room downstairs had undergone a transformation. It was no longer a bare office, fitted only with a desk and stool. Desk and stool were there still, but a carpet, hanging shelves, a few useful books, and other furniture had been introduced, the result being a compact parlour. Mrs. Ashton had her own way of showing good will. His previous application to work in that room, when his fellow-apprentices in over hours were cracking jokes on the kitchen settle, lounging about the yard, tormenting"], [102, "94 THE MANCHESTER MAN. or being tormented by Kezia, had served somewhat to isolate and lift him above them, albeit he took his meals in the kitchen with the rest. This separation was now confirmed by orders Kezia received to \"serve Clegg's dinner in his own room;\" orders which Kezia resented with asperity, and at least three days' ill-humour, and which James declined to execute. He was \"not goin' to disgrace his cloth by waitin' on 'prentice lads !\" Beady-handed Cicily came to the rescue, and took the office on her self, amid the banter of the kitchen, which the quick-witted maid returned with right good will and right good temper. Permission to receive his friends in his own room occasionally had been graciously accorded by Mrs. Ashton herself, with the characteristic observation \u2014 \" They are worthy people, Jabez Clegg, and you owe them a son's duty ; besides, you need some relaxation \u2014 ' The over strained bow is apt to snap,' and 'All"], [103, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 95 work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' ': Altogether, he was more than satisfied. He was not demonstrative, but his heart swelled as he felt within himself that all these little things were stepping-stones upwards ; and he mentally resolved to mount them fairly. He recognised that he was rising, and ere the week was out he found that others recognised it also. His blood-stained garments had been removed, whither he knew not, and he had had to fall back on his grey frieze Sunday suit. Be sure he began to calculate the chances of getting a fresh one. As he was able to go out, he was em ployed on out-door business until his arm should regain its full vitality, and one of his errands was with a note to Mr. Chad wick's tailor, in King Street. At first he thought there was some mistake when the fraction of a man proceeded without more ado to take his measure. Saturday night proved there had been"], [104, "96 THE MANCHESTER MAN. no mistake. On his bed, accompanied by a very kind note from Mr. Chadwick (written with his left hand), lay not only a well-cut, well-made suit of clothes, but a hat, white linen shirts, neck-cloths, and hose. Did ever young girl turn up her back hair, or young man assume his first coat, indifferently ? To Jabez \u2014 the foundling \u2014 the Blue-coat apprentice, this was not merely a first coat, not merely a badge of approaching manhood. The whole outfit, provided as it was by his master's brother in-law, seemed a recognition of the station he was henceforth to fill. No clerk in the counting-house was so well equipped as he, when he stood before his oval swing-glass (for the first time far too small), and endeavoured to survey himself therein, that fine September Sunday morning. I will not presume to say that he looked the conventional gentleman in that suit of glossy brown broadcloth, and beaver hat ;"], [105, "97 THE MANCHESTER MAN. I will not say that he did not feel stiff in them. Only use gives ease ; but this I will say, that a more manly figure never gave shape to garments, or a more noble head to a hat, albeit there was more of strength than beauty in the face it shaded. His forehead was broad and well de veloped ; the reflective as well as the per ceptive faculties were there. There was just a slight defensive rise on the else straight nose ; the eyebrows were full save where a scar broke the line of one. Firm but pleasant were mouth and dimpled chin, and the lower jaw was somewhat massive ; but his full grey eyes, dark almost to blackness, and standing far apart, were clear and deep as wells where truth lay hid, though deep emotion had power to kindle them with the luminosity of stars. I am afraid he was not the only one on whom Parson Gatliffe's eloquence was thrown away that Sabbath morning. If he looked up at the Blue-coat boys in the VOL. II. h"], [106, "98 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Chetham Gallery, with their quaint blue robes and neat bands, to throw memory back and imagination forward, others were doing likewise, from old Simon in his free seat to his envious fellow-'prentices in the pew, whose mocking grimaces drew upon them the sharp censure of the beadle. Party spirit was then at a white heat. Had Peterloo been written on his forehead it could not have marked him out for curious eyes more surely than his sling. Greetings, not altogether congratulatory, followed him through the churchyard. But old Simon caught his left hand in a tremulous grasp, his eyes moist with proud emotion. Tom Hulme beamed upon him, and Mrs. Clowes, energetic as ever, over took them a few yards from the chapter house, just as Joshua Brookes emerged from the door. \" Well, my lad, I'm glad to see you at church again !\" she exclaimed, shaking him warmly by the left arm. \" I hardly"], [107, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 99 knew you in your fine clothes.

Let him stick to the name we gave him at his baptism \u2014 it's worth all your fine Misters.\" And Joshua turned off, muttering, \"Mr. Clegg, in deed !\" as he went away, Neither the old woman in her antiquated gown and kerchief-covered mutch, nor the old parson in his cassock and square cap, modulated their loud voices. Jabez blushed painfully. Both had touched sensitive chords. But others had heard the \" Mr. Clegg,\" and he heard it again, from Kezia and the apprentices, in every tone of mockery and derision.

She was particularly fond of a good play, and as particularly careful of her own pocket. So she watched for such occasions as a special benefit or \" Bespeak \" night, to engage one of the dress-boxes, and take * See Appendix"], [110, "102 THE MANCHESTER MAN. tickets for a select party of her pupils. The young ladies \u2014 apart from all natural love of amusement and display \u2014 were taught to regard their admission to Mrs. Broadbent's train as a high honour \u2014 a mark of exceeding distinction; and few were the parents so stern or so niggardly as to refuse the four shillings for a box ticket when Madame invited and Miss pleaded. The then Theatre Boyal, in Fountain Street, which was opened in 1807, under Macready's management, and brought to the ground by fire in 1844, was, in 1820, a building so capacious \u2014 so solidly built \u2014 it might not fear comparison with Drury Lane. Stage, scene-rooms, dressing-rooms, were all on an extensive scale. There were three tiers of boxes, a large pit, and an immense gallery breaking the line of the third tier.

There were no chairs \u2014 only narrow, baize-covered benches, innocent of backs. And the theatre was lighted by sperm-oil lamps, those round the auditorium being suspend- ed by cords over pulleys, so as to be lowered for lighting, trimming, &c. But the glory of that theatre, of which it was shorn at a later date, was its box-lobby, a lofty, open promenade, wide as a street, and long in proportion, for its one grand entrance was in Fountain Street, the other in Back Mosley Street. But for the step or two at either end, carriages might have driven through, or depositing their living loads within at the saloon doors, have turned easily and driven back. This lobby was naturally a lounge, as well as a waiting-place for servants and others with wraps and pattens, neither carriage nor hackney-coaches being numer-"], [112, "104 THE MANCHESTER MAN. ous, and the streets being \u2014 well, not quite so clean or well-paved as at present. The ten days' trial of Henry Hunt and his compatriots at York had, as is well known, resulted in sentence of imprison ment for different terms, to the discomfi ture of one party, the exultation of the other. Close upon the promulgation of this sentence came Easter week, at the be ginning of April, 1820, when Jabez had little more than a month to serve of his apprenticeship. Edmund Kean was then playing at the Theatre Boyal, supported by Sophia M'Gibbon \u2014 daughter of Woodfall, the memorable printer of \" Junius \" \u2014 a favourite on the Manchester \" boards.\" Either to mark their satisfaction at the result of the trial, or their admiration of the great tragedian, the officers of the Manchester Yeomanry Cavalry bespoke \" Othello \" for the Wednesday evening, and Mrs. Broadbent made the most of the glorious opportunity. She engaged a box"], [113, "105 THE MANCHESTER MAN. close to the centre of the dress-circle, on terms well understood, and as small people take less room than large ones, and her front row was very juvenile, she contrived to make it a profitable investment, even though she took a teacher with her (at a lower rate). The young ladies assembled at the school, and made quite a proces sion to the theatre, where Mrs. Broad bent's own maid took charge of hats and cloaks, and waited drearily in the saloon. Then, duly marshalled by Madame Broad bent and Miss Nuttall, they filed into the box decorously, and took their seats, the youngest in the van \u2014 the whole pro gramme having been rehearsed and re-re hearsed for a day or two beforehand. A bouquet of white rosebuds they might have been called, white muslin was so general ; but one young lady blushed in pink gauze, and Augusta Ashton's lovely head and shoulders were set off by delicate blue crape. There were round necklaces"], [114, "106 THE MANCHESTER MAN. of coral or pearl, long loose gloves of cam- bric or kid, and every damsel in her teens had her fan. But of fans, commend me to Madame Broadbent's. It was no light trifle of ivory or sandal-wood, but of strong green paper, spotted with gold, with ribs and frame of ebony, and it measured half-a-yard when closed. Her well-saved, long-waisted, stiff brocaded robe and petticoat might have been her wedding-dress kept for state occasions ; but that fan, slung by a ribbon from her wrist, was part of her individuality \u2014 the symbol of her authority inseparable from her walking self. A relic of her younger days, she employed it \u2014 citing Queen Char lotte as her exemplar \u2014 to arrest attention, to admonish, to chastise ; and woe to the luckless little lady on whom it came in admonition !

The house was full and fashionable, both stage-boxes being occupied by members of the Manchester Yeomanry, resplendent in silver and blue. Laurence Aspinall, John Walmsley, and Ben Travis were of the party. In the pit were the critics, pressing as closely as possible to the stage. Nods and smiles from friends in different parts of the theatre greeted the component part of Madame Broadbent's bevy of innocents, and smiles responded. Then rose the green curtain upon Ed mund Kean's Othello, and Mrs. M'Gibbon's Desdemona. The audience was enthralled. Act by act the players kept attention fixedr and all went well until the last scene. But, as Othello pressed the murderous pillow down, one of Madame Broadbent's"], [116, "108 THE MANCHESTER MAN. white-f rocked misses in the front row, with whose relatives Desdemona lodged when she was not Desdemona, started up, and cried out piteously \u2014 \"He's killing Mrs. M'Gibbon ! He's killing Mrs. M'Gibbon !\" The clear voice rang through the house, to the consternation of the actors, the amusement of some, and the annoyance of the audience. Some of the officers laughed outright in the very face of the tragic Moor; but Madame Broadbent was furious, all the more that she was bound to suppress her passion then and there. For the credit of her \" Academy,\" she, however, felt bound to resent so flagrant a breach of decorum. Tapping the tearful culprit on the shoulder with her ready fan, in a stern whisper, scarcely less audible than the child's impulsive tribute to the great tragedian, she asked, \" How can you bemean yourself so far, miss, to the disgrace of the school?\" and, beckoning the child"], [117, "109 THE MANCHESTER MAN. forth, she was passed to Miss Nuttall at the very back of the box, sobbing more for Mrs. M'Gibbon than for Mrs. Broadbent. This caused a change of places, which brought Miss Ashton more prominently into view. Laurence Aspinall, an ardent admirer of beauty, put his hand on the shoulder of the officer before him, and said, \" Good heavens, Walmsley ! Do you see that lovely creature in Mother Broad bent's box ?\" \"Which ?\" was the obtuse answer. \"Which!\" (contemptuously echoed). \" The divine beauty in celestial blue. Who is she ?\" And his admiring gaze brought a conscious blush to the young lady's fore head, although the querist was beyond her hearing. \" In blue ? \" And Walmsley lazily scan ned the group. \"Oh! that's Charlotte's cousin, Augusta Ashton! Yes, she is rather pretty ;\" and the married man turned away to the stage."], [118, "110 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" Bather pretty ! She's an angel ! You must introduce me !\" \" Well, well !\" answered the other testily, anxious to end a colloquy which distracted his attention from the tragedy, \" I'll see. But she's only a school-girl \u2014 not yet six teen !\" \"Egad ! but she looks seventeen, and she'll mend of that disqualification every day ;\" and still he kept his eyes on Augusta in a manner extremely disconcerting, though her romantic little heart fluttered, for in him she recognised the \" Adonis \" who had reared his horse so threateningly in front of her uncle Chadwick's house. The green curtain came down amid universal plaudits. Ladies rose to rest themselves and chat, as was the custom. Gentlemen quitted their seats to join friends elsewhere, to lounge in saloon or box-lobby, or to take a hasty glass at the \" Garrick' s Head \" adjoining. Amongst the latter were Walmsley and"], [119, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 111 Aspinall ; but they did not return when the prompter's bell rang the curtain up. There was a pas de deux of Tyrolean peasants by the chief dancers of the company. Then followed an interlude, and then a comic song, all before the last piece ; but the comrades did not return ; and Augusta found herself wondering whether the hand some officer, with the rich copper-coloured hair, would come back at all. They did make their appearance during the progress of the drama (Monk Lewis's \" Castle Spectre,\" in which Mrs. M'Gibbon gave ocular demonstration that she was not killed), both seemingly exhilarated, but they left again before the drama con cluded. Well drilled as were Madame Broadbent's pupils, they could not quit their box in the same order they entered it \u2014 big people so seldom recognise the right of little ones to precedence. They straggled into the sa loon, separated by the crowd. There"], [120, "112 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Madame Broadbent, assisted by Miss Nut tall, collected her brood, and passing on to the box-lobby, they looked around for their respective attendants. There was one \u2014 a fine young man, in height some five feet ten \u2014 who sprang for ward with shawl and calesh for Miss Ashton, at the same time bowing deferen tially to the pompous dame with the big fan. He proceeded to adjust the shawl round the dimpled shoulders so very pre cious to him, and said \u2014 \" I hope you have had a pleasant even- ing, Miss Augusta.\" Then, bowing again to Mrs. Broadbent, he offered his hand respectfully to the young lady, to conduct her home. On the instant they were intercepted by Aspinall and Walmsley, neither so sober as he might have been. \"Augusta, here's my friend Aspinall; deuced good fellow \u2014 quite struck with you,\" was Captain Walmsley's unceremoni-"], [121, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 113 ous introduction \u2014 at a time, too, when in troductions were somewhat formal. \" Quite, Miss Ashton,\" he assented. \" 'Pon my soul, I am ! Your charming face has quite captivated me, and those eyes pierce my heart like bullets. Permit me to escort you home.\" There was an amusing consciousness of his own attractions in this free expression of his admiration. A woman of the world, with her weapons ready, might have dis missed him either with hauteur, badinage, or cool indifference ; but to Augusta Ashton, almost a child in years, it was be wildering and disconcerting. Her eyes fell \u2014 her colour rose. She stood silent, abashed, and confused. Native modesty took alarm. Jabez came to her relief \"Miss Ashton is under my protection, sir : she requires no other escort.\" The words were cool as those of a man who, having his temper well under control, VOL. II.

With cool effrontery his old antagonist looked him full in the face. \" So it's you again, yellow-skirt ! A nice fellow to protect a pretty girl : a fellow without skill to defend himself, or spirit to resent an insult ;\" and the speaker's red lips curled with derision. The eyes of Jabez kindled and his teeth set. There was no lack of spirit, but not the spirit of which common brawls are made. He was anxious to get the trem bling Augusta away from the gathering crowd. Madame Broadbent, shorn of half her pretty train, came up aghast. \"Young lady!

Ignoring the coarse taunt of Lieutenant Aspinall, he endeavoured to lead her past them, simply saying to Captain Walmsley \u2014 \"Mr. Ashton committed his daughter to my care. I am auswerable for her safety.\" Aspinall, mistaking his calmness for pusillanimity, again intercepted their pas sage, and would have taken Augusta's hand. But a will strong as his own \u2014 an arm strengthened by lifting and carrying heavy burdens \u2014 was opposed to him.

She may not have left the theatre. Be sides, I feel that I also owe an apology for leaving a lady of her age unprotected in the midst of such a scene.

He was not three minutes more in reach ing the box-entrance in Back Mosley Street ; but for all that, the short walk home, and the brief delay caused by sleepy-head James, had given ample time to empty and close the theatre, from which more than half the audience had dispersed before they left. Even the oil lamps over the doors were extinguished ; and though a few stragglers loitered about \u2014 the natural hangers-on to histrionic skirts \u2014 and there were brawlers in the neighbourhood, he saw none of those he went to seek."], [129, "121 THE MANCHESTER MAN. The fact was, Captain Travis had hauled Lieutenant Aspinall from the ground with little ceremony, and, with a -sharp reproof for \"the disgrace he was bringing on their corps by insulting a young lady in a public place, as if sufficient odium did not attach to the Yeomanry already,\" forced him into a waiting hackney-coach, giving the driver orders to bear him home to his father's house on Ardwick Green, heedless of the young officer's remonstrance to the con trary.

As for Madame Broadbent, no sooner had Miss Nuttall disposed of the last of the budding misses than she hid her indigna tion in the deep shadow of her large calesh, and, with an access of importance, left the theatre, slightly in advance of her humble dependants, and made her fearless way through Fountain Street and High Street, with a step which augured unpleasantness for all beneath her roof if her supper were not done to a turn and served to a nicety. Augusta was somewhat loth to leave her pillow in the morning, after the night's unusual dissipation, and was still more reluctant to encounter her lessons and Mrs. Broadbent ; and she for the first time remarked to Cicily that she thought she was \" quite too old to go to school.\" As if the world was not one huge school, wherein the dunces get punished most"], [131, "123 THE MANCHESTER MAN. severely, and even the best and brightest do not escape the rod. But Augusta Ashton, buoyant, blooming, cherished, admired, adored, could not see that her real schooling would begin when Madame Broadbent's reign ceased. No doubt Mr. Ashton would have been coaxed into granting an extension of his darling daughter's Easter holiday, and suffered her to remain at home that Thursday morning, but he was at Whaley- Bridge ; and mamma met her request with \u2014 \"No, my dear, you have had quite holiday enough.

As she sat down to her solitary meal, another thought crossed her mind. \" James, ask Mr. Clegg to oblige me by stepping this way.\" Mr. Clegg was with her in an instant : the summons was unusual. \" Jabez, I'll thank you to ascertain why Miss Ashton has not returned from school at the usual time.

Groups of girls, with slates and bags in their hands, loitering on the pathway at the entrance and in the passage, made way for him, with curious looks and whispers among them selves (Jabez was not unknown to some of the senior pupils). The school-room door stood ajar : the whole place was in a commotion unprecedented in that precise establishment. Madame Broadbent, holding by the copy-slip axiom, \"Familiarity breeds con tempt,\" preserved her dignity and that of her high office by avoiding personal contact with her pupils, save at stated"], [134, "126 THE MANCHESTER MAN. hours. Her assistant-governesses were at their posts from nine until twelve, from two until four ; but Madame herself only sailed into the long room from the house door across the entry at eleven o'clock to receive reports, inspect work, dispense rewards, or administer reproof and chas tisement. \" Spare the rod and spoil the child\" had not been abolished from the educational code fifty-five years back. The double shock her importance had received at the theatre sent her home to quarrel with her supper; and as a meal dispatched in an ill humour does not easily digest, Othello and the Castle Spectre haunted her pillow, and broke her rest with nightmares. She rose late, and stepped into her schoolroom later than usual, to visit her accumulation of disagreeables on minor delinquents, as well as on the primary offenders. Let us be just : Madame Broadbent had"], [135, "127 THE. MANCHESTER MAN. gracious smiles and approving words to dispense to the ultra-good, and their very rarity made them valuable. But if she rewarded any that day, it was only that severity might stand out in contrast. Little hearts beat, little fingers plied in dustrious needles, little eyes bent over work, when Madame's step was heard in the entry ; but when her august presence fairly filled the room, every little damsel rose simultaneously, and saluted her entrance with a low, formal, deferential curtsey. Two rooms had evidently been thrown into one to give required space, the back portion being curiously lit by a narrow, small-paned window extending along the side, high above the rows of racks and pegs. It was the writing end of the room. Madame Broadbent occupied a seat in the front portion, almost opposite to the door ; and as she marched towards it with more than ordinary loftiness, and beat her fan"], [136, "128 THE MANCHESTER MAN. on her table with one peremptory tap, instead of a short rapid quiver, to enforce her command, \" Attention, ladies !\" the very youngest of those ladies could inter pret the signs portentously. Lucky was the young lady whose work passed muster that morning ; so many were condemned to stocks, backboard, columns of spelling, recitations from the \" Speaker \" and Thom son's \"Seasons,\" lengths of open hem, back stitching, or seaming ! At length Madame Broadbent, having dismissed ordinary business, rapped her fan upon the table, and in a sharp per emptory tone called \" Miss Ashton !\" \u2014 and Miss Ashton, who had been expecting the summons all the morning, came forward at her bidding, but not with the ordinary alacrity of pupilage. She had left her childhood (I had almost said her girlhood) behind her, in the box-lobby of the Theatre Boyal. \" Miss Brookes !\" cried the same sharp"], [137, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 129 voice ; and with a painful start the little girl who had committed such a terrible breach of decorum before a whole theatre as to utter her impromptu commentary on the tragedian's art, rose, trembled, burst into tears, but was too agitated to obey with sufficient promptitude. Her seat was on a low front form. Madame took a step forward, stretched out her arm, and drag ged the child by the ear to the side of Augusta, then gave her a smart cuff as an admonition to more prompt obedience another time. Then with another rap of her fan on the table, which set all hearts palpitating, she began an inflated harangue to the mite of a child and the budding woman, in which she reproached them both with bringing disgrace on the \" Academy,\" hitherto so irreproachable. The one had drawn the attention of a whole theatre to her ill breeding and want of proper training ; the other by \" boldness of look and manner VOL. II.

Her temper interrupted her oration ; she shook Augusta violently, and condemned her to remain in school until she had learn ed one of Mrs. Chapone's letters by heart. Then she darted on the smaller one as the primary cause of all, shook her till the little teeth chattered, and dragged her by the lobe of the ear towards a dark closet, set apart for heinous offenders. Something akin to rebellion had been growing in Augusta's breast all the morning. She was a girl of quick impulses and sympathies, and was not only struck by the disproportion of punish ment meted out, but by the terror on the"], [139, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 131 little one's face. She threw herself in their path, and to the utter astonishment alike of pupils and teachers laid hold of the child to release her, exclaiming as she did so, \" You shall not lock her in the dark ! you will kill her with fright, you cruel Madame Broadbent !\" If Madame Broadbent had been wrathful before she was furious now. Never in her long experience had she been so braved. Without thought, without premeditation, she raised her heavy fan and struck sharply at Augusta. The blow fell on her beautiful bare neck, the collar-bone snapped, as it will do with a very slight matter, and Augusta dropped ! Cicily, waiting outside at the time, heard Madame's raised voice and Augusta's im petuous remonstrance ; then a thud, a fall, and a suppressed scream from the girls ; and without pausing to knock, she pushed open the door. Cicily had been too k2"], [140, "132 THE MANCHESTER MAN. long the recipient of Augusta's school-girl confidence to stand in much awe of Mrs. Broadbent at best of times. Now she darted forward to raise her young mistress, whom she almost worshipped, and certainly did not consult either Madame's feelings or dignity in the epithets she launched at her. No one had been more electrified at the effect of that stroke with the fan than Mrs. Broadbent's self. She seemed petrified, and Cicily's indignant outburst fell on deaf ears ; but as Miss Nuttall ran for water, and Cicily cried out for a doctor, she roused to self-consciousness, and closed the school-room door as if to keep the outer world in ignorance of what was going on inside. A wide latitude was then allowed for school discipline ; but even Madame Broad bent was sensible that the blow which had felled Mr. Ashton's only daughter was a blow to imperil her seminary."], [141, "133 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Augusta did not revive. Miss Nuttall suggested that the school should be dis missed, and a doctor fetched ; and, before either could be effected, Jabez was on the spot. He took in the scene at a glance ; Augusta, white as her frock, her hair all in disorder, lay extended on a form, her head supported by the kneeling Cicily, whilst excited girls and teachers flocked helplessly around. \" Good heavens ! what is the matter ! what has happened to Miss Ashton ?\" was his hurried and agitated inquiry. One said one thing, one another. Wrathful Cicily came nearest to the mark. \" That old wretch has struck ar darlin' wi' her great fan. Aw'm afeard her neck bone's brokken !\" \" Impossible !

There was no sign of revival. \" My God ! this is terrible ! Oh, madam, how could you do it ?

With all his haste and care, so much time had been spent, Mrs. Ashton's fears had already conjured up all manner of evils, all of course wide of the mark. That some thing was wrong she felt assured, and he found her dressing to follow her dilatory messengers. The stoppage of the coach and his evident agitation were confirma tory ; but the absolute facts roused as much indignation as grief. Yet Mrs. Ashton never forgot herself; and though the waiting coach bore her to Bradshaw Street, to add her maternal re proaches to the wrathful utterances of Cicily, the rough rebukes of Dr. Hull, and the prickings of Madame Broadbent's own conscience, the natural dignity of her man ner more overawed and impressed the re sentful schoolmistress than all which had gone before. She was as profuse in apolo gies as in extenuating pleas, but she was"], [146, "138 THE MANCHESTER MAN. not prepared to combat Mrs. Ashton's pro verbial argumentation. \"Facts are stubborn things, madam, and she who cannot govern herself is not fit to govern others.\" Neither coach-making nor road-making had reached the acme of perfection, and Augusta's removal home, without the dis placement of the bone, had to be considered. A sedan chair \u2014 the last in the town \u2014 was still kept for invalid use at the In firmary. Jabez was aware of this, and be fore Dr. Hull could make the suggestion he had proposed to go for it, and was back with the black, brass-nailed sedan long before the doctors thought their patient fit to be removed.

But when patient, doctors, friends, and vehicles had gone their way, and the school was soon after dismissedr the harassed, agitated and prescient dis ciplinarian surrendered herself to alternate fits of hysteria, passion, lamentation, and overweening assumption. That first outburst over, the self important dame stood on her \" right to maintain discipline,\" even when confronted by Mr. Ashton, no longer the easy-going, pleasant parent of a paying pupil, but the angry father of an injured only child, who had posted from Whaley-Bridge, on the first intelligence of the mischance, leaving his business incomplete."], [148, "140 THE MANCHESTER MAN.

Great and general was the sympathy expressed on the occasion.

Whaley-Bridge has been mentioned more than once, for in that village, near the high road from Manchester to Buxton, Mr. Ash ton possessed a water-mill on the pictur esque banks of the river Goyt, which there divided the counties of Cheshire and Derby shire. . It had been established in the previous century, together with another in the contiguous vale of Taxal, by a specu lative ancestor of Mrs. Ashton, whose old hall was in the locality. The two places had been chiefly colonised by his work people, many of whom had been pauper apprentices from Manchester and Warring ton. Besides the mill, Mr. Ashton owned the \"White Hart\" Inn, close to the bridge, where the Buxton coaches stopped ; and Carr Cottage, a long, low, rough-cast"], [150, "142 THE MANCHESTER MAN. building, nestling under the shadow of a fine old farm-house which crowned the elevated ridge of Yeardsley-cum-Whaley, lang-syne the Gothic stone Hall of the warlike Yeardsleys. From this farm-house, Carr Cottage was separated by a retired walk at the back, which, itself a wilderness of nettles, gave ac cess to the cellarage and a clear well, and led the adventurer away up the hill between the cottage grounds and the farmer's tall high banked hedges, which almost overtopped the cottage roof. And on the left of the cottage (as viewed from the high road) spread the granaries, stabling, and farm yard, enclosed by remains of the ancient wall, and entered by a step or two through an ancient Gothic doorway, over which ivy and honeysuckle clambered in luxur iant rivalry. The cottage, which on each floor contain ed four capacious rooms in its length, was on the ground divided in the middle by a"], [151, "143 THE MANCHESTER MAN. respectable lobby ; the house-place and kitchen lying on the left, the parlours to the right as you entered. There were two staircases, one at each end of the building, the one running upwards in the kitchen itself, the other from a small enclosed space at the back of a parlour, containing also a china closet door, and lit by a low window close to the foot of the staircase, from which it was possible to step out into the garden, unseen by anyone in the house. Otherwise, both chambers and parlours had doors of communication from end to end of the building, the two middle chambers being only accessible through the others. The lower windows in the front \u2014 at least, those of the large parlours \u2014 were brought close to the ground, and over looked a charming landscape ; descending, at first suddenly, from the wide-spread flower-garden (with its one great sycamore to the right of the cottage for shade), then with a gradual slope to a bean-field below,"], [152, "144 THE MANCHESTER MAN. to a meadow crossed by a narrow rill, then, after a wider stretch of grass, the alder and hazel fringe of a trout-stream, skirting the high road, on the far side of which tall poplars waved, and in Autumn shed their leaves in the wider waters of the\" Goyt fresh from the bridge, where the road bends. Bivulets, road, and river ran parallel. And from the road a broad wooden gate gave access (over a bridge across the trout-stream) to a wide, steep avenue between trim hedges, which rose to the level of the cottage, in itself as de lightful a retreat as any wearied denizen of town could desire. To Mr. Ashton it was necessary as an adjunct to his factory, an occasional home for his family in the Summer, a lodge for himself when a visit of inspection was desirable.

Mr. Ashton, putting up the collar of his coat, drove direct to Carr, much to the surprise of his unprepared overlooker and wife, who had charge of the cottage. He said nothing of any companion ; and Jabez some twenty minutes later walked into the bar of the \"White Hart,\" dusty and weary, as if with long walking ; called for bread-and-cheese and ale ; intimated his intention to remain the night, if he could"], [157, "149 THE MANCHESTER MAN. have a bed ; talked of the scenery, and led the host to tell of the best points for sketching. Professing fatigue, he kept his seat in the bar-parlour the remainder of the day. The sling, not yet wholly discarded, drew attention, as he expected it would. The incomers, eyeing him askance, talked politics before him, and finding him less glib than themselves, whispered that he was a refugee from Peterloo, and, to show their sympathy with the party to which he was supposed to belong, freely discussed the political aspect of the district before him. He was young, free with his money, and they were not reticent. He found that the overlooker had made himself, and his master through himself, obnoxious to his weavers, and that only prompt measures would prevent an outbreak. The next morning Mr. Ashton put his head into the inn, greeted \" Mr. Clegg\" as some one he was surprised to meet in so"], [158, "150 THE MANCHESTER MAN. remote a spot, and invited him to Carr Cottage. Jabez accepted the invitation for the afternoon, saying he could not spare the morning. Under pretence of sketching, he took his way by the Goyt to the neigh bourhood of the mill with pencils and sketch-book ; women and children flocked inquisitively round him in their dinner hour, and talked to him ; then he rested in a weaver's cot, and when he found his way to Carr in the afternoon, and sat with Mr. Ashton for privacy under the dropping keys of the sycamore, he had brought with him the key to the prevailing discontent. Mr. Ashton listened, took an enormous quantity of snuff, dropped an occasional \" Just so,\" and, knowing the sore, set about healing it. He drove back to Man chester, leaving Jabez as his temporary deputy \u2014 high honour for so young a man, \u2014 and the overlooker was required to ren der up his accounts."], [159, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 151 A fortnight later, as Jabez was midway up the avenue to Carr in the afternoon, he turned, hearing the blithe bugle of the coming Buxton coach, and watched its dashing progress along the road. To his astonishment it stopped at the gate. He himself reached the spot at a run. His eyes had not played him false. Simon Clegg, in his best clothes, was there on the box-seat ; Tom Hulme and Bess and little Sim sat close behind him. Mr. Ashton was himself an inside passen ger. In the bustle and confusion of alighting, and dragging boxes from the boot and from the top, curiosity was kept on the stretch. It was not until the entire party were under the roof of the cottage that Jabez was enlightened. Tom Hulme was the new overlooker, Bess the new care taker of Carr Cottage, which was hence forth their rural rent-free home ; and to Simon, long disqualified by rheumatism"], [160, "152 THE MANCHESTER MAN. for the wet and slush of the tannery, was given the charge of the garden, with a boy under him. And of all the group old Simon and little Sim were most delighted. Some eight months before, Sim (then about two years old) had slipped on the frosty stones in the old Long Millgate Yard, and, rolling down its rugged declivi ty, was supposed to have injured his spine, and he had been too delicate ever since to run about freely. To the child, therefore, whose shoulders seemed unnaturally high, the change from the stifling court was something too exuberant for expression. To Simon Clegg, who, in losing his crony Matt, had felt the old haunts oppressive, the bountiful expanse of nature before him, and the comfortable, fragrant home, were matters of deep thankfulness. \"Moi lad,\" said he to Jabez, when the latter was about to depart with Mr. Ashton, after they were fairly inducted, \" ar Bess said thah would be a Godsend to us, an'"], [161, "153 THE MANCHESTER MAN. thah has bin.

There is a matronly air of re spectability about Mrs. Hulme, that will help to uphold her husband's position amongst the workpeople, and I can trust his soldierly discipline for keeping the rebellious in order. Thus said Mr. Ashton to his good lady, sitting by the fireside after supper, the night of his return home. Then, after a little pondering and trifling with his snuff box, he added, as if reflectively \u2014 \"It is all very well, my dear, to serve the young man's friends and ourselves at the same time, but I should like to do something for Jabez himself. It is entirely to his clear head and his tact that we owe the preservation of peace at Whaley-Bridge.

In removing his humble friends you have cleared one barrier to his advancement.\" Mr. Ashton did not say \" Just so !\" for a wonder ; he turned his gold box round and round in his fingers, and at length gave utterance to a thought which took Mrs. Ashton by surprise. \"If we remove all the young man's old associations, don't you think we ought to provide him with new ones?\" \" I think, William, we ought to 'leave well alone ;' smooth paths are slippery paths.

I am afraid that at this time he brooded over his orphanhood, and that unknown father who had disappeared so mysterious ly, and strained his soaring thoughts in their flight towards possibilities more than was good for him. He was too much alone for one of his years, and there were times in those long candle-lit Winter evenings when books and pencils dropped from his wearied hands, and for lack of a companion he held dreamy converse with the fire. Of course his library was restricted, and"], [166, "158 THE MANCHESTER MAN. there were no institutions in Manchester at that time where young men of his class could meet for mutual improvement, or that mental polish caused bythe attrition of mind upon mind. Occasionally, at long intervals, and at first to the utter confusion of James, Captain Travis had inquired for \"Mr. Clegg,\" and been shown into the little sitting-room, with a disregard to \" caste \" very creditable to both of them ; and now and then Mr. Chadwick and Mr. Ashton would drop in together for half-an-hour's chat, the gratitude of the former being deeper than the surface. But rarely did a feminine face, save Cicily's, brighten up his solitude, and she, devoted to her young mistress, had always something to say about Augusta, if only what she wore, or how she looked, which sent him off into dreamland immediately.

The fan which broke Augusta's collar bone broke down a barrier for Jabez. No personal sacrifice attended the service he rendered. He but went and came as an active messenger. But he went and came with intelligence and promptitude, and exercised for mother and daughter both the care and forethought of a much older man. In the father's absence the father was not missed.

He was her messenger to the Chadwicks, her amanuensis to Mr. Ashton ; and, when Ellen and her mother arrived somewhere about tea-time, for the second time he was invited to join their party ; and one, if not"], [169, "161 THE MANCHESTER MAN. two, pair of cheeks burned as the invitation was given. Then, the night Mr. Ashton returned home to find Augusta an invalid, he was gratified to see Jabez again at the tea table, and after that at odd times, until the restraint upon him gradually wore away, and he would read to Augusta and Ellen, as the latter sat at work, and do his best to make the time pass pleasantly. Next Mr. Ashton took it into his head to teach him backgammon and cribbage, to help to make his own evenings at home more lively. And Mrs. Chadwick, who, for some occult reason, had resisted her husband's desire to show courtesy to his preserver, could scarcely be less gracious than her grander sister, who owed him so much less ; so now the green-parlour door in Oldham Street was opened to him, and as Jabez refreshed his memory with Hogarth's VOL. II. m"], [170, "162 THE MANCHESTER MAN. prints, he felt that he had made another step up the ladder. Those were halcyon days ; while Augusta, too tall to be robust, recovered so slowly, and was so much gratified by his attempts to entertain her. Halcyon days for more than one. Yet, ere Jabez was out ofhis apprentice ship, or Augusta had left her pillowed sofa, a pebble was thrown into the stream which broke the surface of the tranquil waters, and disturbed them for ever. Mr. Ashton was one of the original shareholders in the Portico, a classic stone building erected in 1806 as a library and reading-room, on the other side of Mosley Street, which, with its pillared facade and flight of steps, like an Ionic temple, looked down on the plain red-brick front of the Assembly Booms, though its opposite neighbour stood quite as high in repute, and was equally exclusive in its constitu tion."], [171, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 163 Mr. Aspinall, the Cannon Street cotton merchant (who dined with the Scramble Club, instituted by business men whose homes were in the suburbs), was likewise a shareholder in the Portico ; and from con stant meeting at the long tables within the book-shelved, galleried walls of its lofty reading room, he and Mr. Ashton had a tolerably lengthy acquaintance, although it had never ripened into intimacy \u2014 the men were so dissimilar. Charlotte Walmsley was naturally trou bled by the result of Madame Broadbent's notions of discipline, and not unnaturally (considering the condition in which Ben Travis had taken him home) blamed her husband as the primary cause. As naturally he shifted the onus to the shoulders of Laurence Aspinall, and, taking him to task, plainly told him he ought to apologise. Laurence snatched at the proposal. \"My dear Jack, nothing would please m2"], [172, "164 THE MANCHESTER MAN. me better ! I'll make a thousand apologies, if you'll only introduce me.\" John Walmsley had had quite enough of introductions ; besides, he stood in some awe of Mrs. Ashton, and did not know how she might take it, especially as his friend Aspinall had acquired the character of \"a wild spark.\" He emphatically declined. But if Laurence Aspinall once set his mind on a thing he would attain it, if within the range of possibility, whether by fair means or foul, whatever might be the consequences. For a few days he was on his best behaviour at home ; and having won his father over by expressions of deep contri tion, and promises of reformation, and the assurance that he would never again do anything \"unbecoming a gentleman,\" he prevailed on him to introduce him to Mr. Ashton, with a view to making his own apologies in person. \" Well, Laurence, you can go with me"], [173, "165 THE MANCHESTER MAN. to the Portico to-morrow morning, and if Mr. Ashton is there, we will see what can be done ;\" the tone in which this was said clearly implying, \" If we seek an introduc tion to the Ashtons for the purpose of making the amende honorable as befits gentlemen, there can be no doubt of its acceptance.\" But when they met Mr. Ashton on the steps of the Portico the following morning, the self-complacence of the lofty gentleman received a slight but uncontemplated check. Mr. Ashton nodded to Mr. Aspinall with a beaming face, and would have passed his acquaintance with a mere \" Good morning,\" but the other stopped, and after shaking hands, and remarking that trade was slack, presented, with due formality, the hand some, elegant six feet of dandyism who bore him company. \" Mr. Ashton, let me make you acquaint ed with my son, sir \u2014 Mr. Ashton, my son Laurence ; Laurence, Mr. Ashton.\""], [174, "166 THE MANCHESTER MAN. The young gentleman raised his stylish beaver from his rich coppery curls, and bowed with courtly grace in acknowledg ment of Mr. Ashton's formal bow, whilst his father continued, almost in the tone of one who confers an honour \u2014 \" The fact is, my son, sir, desires an opportunity of expressing to Miss Ashton his deep regret for the indiscretion of which he was guilty in the lobby of the Theatre Boyal, some ten days back.\" The smile faded from the face of Mr. Ashton, who, with a reserve very foreign to him, put his hand into his pocket for his snuff-box instead of extending it to the young man, and, tapping it with a little impatience, caught at his words. \" Indiscretion, sir ? What you are pleased to call ' indiscretion ' has placed my daughter in the doctors' hands with a broken collar-bone.\" Before Mr. Aspinall could reply, Laur ence, better skilled to temporise, interposed."], [175, "167 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" So, to my infinite regret, my friend Mr. Walmsley has already informed me, sir.

It is this, Mr. Ashton, which impels me to seek an opportunity to express the sensibility of my grave offence, and my extreme regret, to Mrs. Ashton and Miss Ashton in per son. I cannot rest until I have implored their pardon !\" The tones in which this apologetic speech was delivered were at once so suave, remorseful, and sympathetic that Mr. Ash ton, whose sternness was seldom of long duration, was considerably mollified.

He reverted to the latter circumstance \u2014 \" I think, young sir, you owe an apology to some one else under my roof \u2014 the young man who received the sabre-cut you de signed for my brother-in-law, Mr. Chad wick.\" Aspinall's handsome face flushed. His father's quick reply gave him time to think. \" You surely, Mr. Ashton, would not expect my son to apologise to an appren tice-lad, a mere College-boy.\" \" Just so ! I would expect him to apologise to anyone he had injured, were it a beggar !\" Here the son interposed : \" My good sir, do not remind me of the horrors of that dreadful day ! I shudder when I recall it. We acted under orders, and I swear I was utterly unconscious and irresponsible for"], [177, "169 THE MANCHESTER MAN. my actions throughout the whole affray.\" And Laurence seemed desirous to wash his hands of the responsibility. \" The fact is,\" said Mr. Aspinall, coming to his son's rescue, \" Laurence had taken more wine than his young head would stand on both occasions. It takes years to season a cask, you know, Mr. Ashton, and we must not be too hard on young fellows, if they slip sometimes. We have all had some wild oats to sow.\" This was a platitude of the period, but Mr. Ashton's \" Just so !\" was not a cordial assent ; and Laurence, fearing the conver sation was taking an unfortunate turn, led it back to its original request. But Mr. Ashton tapped his box, and, offering it to his interlocutors, took a pinch himself, and then a second, before he came to a decision. It was evidently a debatable question. \" I will mention your request to Mrs. Ashton, young gentleman, and if I find her agreeable to receive you, I can take you"], [178, "170 THE MANCHESTER MAN. across with me to-morrow morning, pro vided you meet me here. Good day.\" Mr. Aspinall's \"Good day\" was some what stiff. He had held his head very high all his life, metaphorically as well as physically, and was not disposed to be snubbed by one whose status he considered scarcely on a par with his own. He was disposed to look on his son's peccadilloes as some of those \" wild oats \" which young gentlemen of spirit were expected to sow, and considered his fine figure and beautiful features, his education, accomplishments, and prospects, passports to any society; and that Mr. Ashton should for one moment hesitate to open his heart and his doors to his son, was an indignity not to be borne. \"The fact is, Laurence, that, if you make an apology to those people after this, you have less spirit than I take you to have !\" was his conclusion. \" Never you mind, father, I know what I'm about. I want to get my foot in"], [179, "171 THE MANCHESTER MAN. there,\" answered subtle Laurence. And he managed it. Mr. Ashton went home to dinner full of his conversation on the Portico steps, and set his romantic daughter's heart in a flutter by mooting the point at issue in her presence. \"Oh, papa! do bring him; I want to see him again, he is so handsome !\" \" ' Handsome is that handsome does,' Augusta,\" was Mrs. Ashton's commentary on that young lady's impulsive exclama tion. \"Charlotte says he is very wild,\" re marked Ellen, \" and I feel as if I should shudder at the sight of him, after his con duct at Peterloo.\" \" You don't shudder when Captain Travis calls, and you don't shut the door in John Walmsley's face, and they may have done things just as bad, if you did but know it, Ellen,\" retorted Augusta, standing on the defensive for the absent \" Adonis.\""], [180, "172 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" Just so, my dear, so they might,\" ad mitted Mr. Ashton, whilst Ellen held her peace, silenced by something in her cousin's retort. \"Yes, William, but look on the poor bandaged neck and shoulders of our child, and think of that ruffian's cruelty to Jabez and others when a schoolboy. I don't think either John Walmsley or Mr. Travis could have done anything so bad.\" \" Well, but, mamma,\" argued spoiled Augusta, \" Jabez forgave him ; and I think Madame Broadbent is more to blame than Mr. Aspinall \u2014 he only offered to bring me home.\" Mrs. Ashton shook her head as she rose from table. \"Besides, mamma, he says he only wants to apologise, and you know you need not invite him again unless you like.

The next day Mr. Ashton made at least one false step in his life, and brought over his own threshold a blight. Faultless were the curves of the stylish hat, faultless the fit of pantaloons, and coat, and Hessian boots, and York-tan gloves ; graceful the figure they adorned ; graceful the apology tendered so adroitly \u2014 more to the mother than to the daugh ter \u2014 but if ever a graceless good-for nothing cast a shadow on a good man's hearth, it was the wolf in sheep's clothing whose hungry jaws were watering for the pet lamb of the fold, and who made so courtly an exit full in the sight of Jabez, as he crossed the end of the hall to his soli tary dinner in his own room."], [182, "174 CHAPTEB X.

Be sure Laurence Aspinall did not carry this analysis into society, written on his forehead. Instead, he had cultivated the art of fascination ; and in the brief space occupied by that apologetic introductory visit in Mosley Street, he not only con trived to dazzle the romance-beclouded eyes of Augusta, but, what was almost as much to his purpose, to win over Mr. Ashton, and to weaken the prejudice of Miss Augusta's less pliant mamma. Ellen Chadwick was the only one on whom he made no impression, the only one who retained a previous opinion \u2014 confirmed. Possibly, as Charlotte Walmsley's sister, she knew something of his life below the surface, and had imbibed that sister's no tion that he \" led John Walmsley away.\""], [185, "177 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Possibly, too, as Charles Chadwick's daugh ter, she contrasted the silken speech of the drawing-room dandy with the hectoring, sword-in-hand, yeomanry cavalry lieuten ant who, in striking at her father, had wounded Jabez his deliverer instead. At all events, she met the enthusiastic admiration of Augusta after his departure, the gratified encomiums of her uncle, and the more subdued approbation of her aunt, with the unvarying expression, \" He would have murdered my dear father but for Jabez Clegg, and Mr. Clegg is worth a hundred of him.\" Mr. Laurence knew better than to pre sume on that introduction all at once. From their gardens and greenhouses at Ardwick and Fallowfield, he sent small baskets of early flowers and fruit to Mrs. Ashton, for her daughter, with courteous inquiries ; but he allowed several days to elapse before he presented himself in per son, and then his call was of the briefest.

May, sweet-scented month of promise, brought to Jabez Clegg in 1820 his natural and legal heritage \u2014 manhood and man hood's freedom. He was no longer an apprentice bound to a master by the will of others. He had a right to think and act for himself, subject ouly to the laws of God and of the realm. True, that free agency brought with it a train of responsi bilities, but the new man was not the one to overlook or ignore the fact. He had thought long and keenly of the coming change, and all it might involve, months before it came. His fixed wages as an indoor apprentice, according to indenture, were no great mat ter ; but, supplemented by coin he extract ed from his paint-box after business hours,"], [187, "179 THE MANCHESTER MAN. he had found a margin for saving, besides contributing to the humble wants of his early fosterers. The latter duty he had never neglected, but Simon was as sternly just as the lad had been gratefully generous, and, even when poverty bit the hardest, would never accept the whole of his earnings. \" Si thi, Jabez, if thah dunnot keep sum mat fur thisel' to put by fur a nest-egg, thah'll ne'er see the good o' thi own earnin's, an' thah'll lose heart in toime,\" the old -tanner had been wont to say, when sturdily bmiting the extent to which his foster-son should open his small purse. So Jabez, leading a steady, industrious life, spending little on personal gratifica tion, save what he invested in books, had quite a little store laid by \u2014 the result of very small savings \u2014 against the time when he might have to shift for himself.

Besides the high desk and stool, it contained an oil cloth-topped hexagon table, with a deep rim of partitioned drawers, three wooden chairs, a sort of fire-guard fender, and a poker; but there was neither carpet nor oil- cloth on the floor, and the walls had but a dim recollection of paint.

It'll mak' ar Bess's heart leap wi' joy.\" But Jabez, blushing, half ashamed of hearing his own praises rung out as from a belfry, could only stammer forth \u2014 \"I've endeavoured to do my duty, that is all, sir.\" \" A \u2014 all !\" interjected Mr. Chadwick, in his imperfect speech, \" Nelson sa \u2014 said du \u2014 u \u2014 ty was all Engla \u2014 and expected of ev \u2014 ev'ry man, but it w \u2014 won the b\u2014 battle of Tr\u2014 Trafalgar !\""], [192, "184 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" Duty wins the battle of life, brother,\" put in Mrs. Ashton, who had quietly entered the counting-house by the door behind Jabez. \"Just so, just so !\" assented Mr. Ashton, as he rose and handed his chair to the lady whose stately presence seemed to fill the room ; \" and Jabez has only to continue doing his duty to win his battle of life, I take it. But to our business. \u2014 You have hitherto served us well, Jabez, in the warehouse and out of it ; you have been doubly useful to me as a designer and as a detector of the roguery and mismanage ment of others. Then, to my daughter, who is far dearer than either warehouse or trade, you have rendered more than one service.\" \" Oh, sir, do not name it, I beg. It has been my highest pleasure to serve Miss Ashton \u2014 or yourself,\" Jabez exclaimed, the two last words rising to his lips simul taneously with the thought that his"], [193, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 185 sudden outburst might fail of appreciation by Miss Ashton's wealthy relatives. \" Just so ! but I must name it, Jabez, as. a reason for my proposal to retain you in my employ, and for assigning to you a situation and salary higher than is usually accorded to an apprentice just out of his time. But as you have shown stability and judgment beyond your years, and I know you to be honourable in all re spects, I feel I am justified in making the offer.\" Mr. Ashton then stated, with a little seasoning of snuff, the salary he proposed to give the young man, and the duties he required as an equivalent, if Jabez accepted his proposition. The eyes of Jabez sparkled and his cheeks glowed. As for Simon, he seemed dumb with delight and astonishment at the good fortune of the foundling. \" If !\" cried Jabez, \" there can be no ' if,' sir; you overpower me with an offer so far"], [194, "186 THE MANCHESTER MAN. above my deserts.

Is not that so?\" \u2014 turning to Mr. Chad wick. \" Cer\u2014 certainly !\""], [196, "188 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Jabez looked from one to another, then to Simon, but no help was forthcoming from that quarter. Mrs. Ashton came to his relief : \" I think, Mr. Clegg, you had better ' look before you leap.' Whatever decision you make will equally satisfy us. But I see you need time to consider. Suppose you consult your foster-father, and give Mr. Ashton your decision at the outcome-supper to night.\" The hesitation of Jabez was only momentary. We are told that all the marvels and glories of Paradise were re vealed to Mahomet before a single drop of water had time to flow from a pitcher overturned in his upward flight ; and even whilst Mrs. Ashton spoke, Jabez had time to think. \" Thank you, madam,\" said he, \"but I need no deliberation.

But, if the sudden uproar which chased quiet from the precincts of Mr. Ashton's warehouse and manufactory when the Infirmary clock told noon, broke prema turely upon the conference in the counting house, it was not unexpected. Every"], [200, "192 THE MANCHESTER MAN, apprentice had been similarly greeted at the same period of his life. Until the clock proclaimed twelve, business routine had been undisturbed, but those twelve beats of the timekeeper's hammer had been the signal for every apprentice and work man on the premises to rush pell-mell into the yard, each bearing with him some implement or symbol of his trade, anything which would clash or clang being'preferred. Bemnants of fringe, bed-lace, and carpet binding waved and fluttered like streamers from the hands of the women; umbrella sticks were flourished ; strings of waste ferules, brass wheels, brace-buckles, button and tassel-moulds, cops, and spindles were jingled and jangled together ; tin cans were beaten with picking-rods, punches, ham mers, leather stamps, and other tools, by apprentices and men ; whilst Jabez him self, hoisted on the shoulders of the two smallware-weavers who had seized and borne him from his master's presence,"], [201, "193 THE MANCHESTER MAN. claiming him as one of their own body, a recognised lawful member of their craft, was paraded round and round that inner court-yard, with the crowd in extemporised procession, amid shouts, hurrahs, songs, and that peculiar instrumental accompani ment which was \u2014 noise, not \u2014 music. The household servants had crowded to the scullery door ; clerks stood aloof under the gateway, where Simon Clegg kept them company in an ecstasy of satisfaction ; Mr. and Mrs. Ashton and Mr. Chadwick surveyed the proceedings from the counting house window, whilst even Ellen and Augusta were curious enough to look on from those back-hall steps where they had once before received the hero of that scene, wounded, from a very different one. More than six years had elapsed since the last indoor apprentice had been borne in triumph round that yard (Kit Townley's indentures had been prematurely cancelled), and Jabez may be pardoned if he contrast- VOL.

The last outcome, I remember, was quite tame beside this.\" \"Well, Augusta,\" answered Ellen, \"I believe he deserves it. I know my father thinks there is not such another young man as Mr. Clegg in all Manchester.\" \" Yes, he's very kind, and obliging, and clever, and persevering, and all that, and I like him very well ; but then you know, Ellen, he is not a gentleman, and he is not handsome by any means,\" responded Augusta, in quite a patronising tone. Ellen looked grave. \" He is all that is good and noble, if he was not born a gentleman ; and / think him handsome. He has a frank, open, ex pressive countenance, and a good figure,"], [203, "195 THE MANCHESTER MAN. and good manners, and what more would you have ?\" Augusta turned her head sharply, and looked up archly in her cousin's face. \" It's well Captain Travis does not hear you, Ellen, or he might be jealous of the prentice-knight,\" she said, banteringly. Ellen coloured painfully. \" When shall I make you understand that Mr. Travis is nothing to me ?\" asked she. \" When my cousin makes me understand that she is nothing to Mr. Travis,\" was the quick reply, as Jabez was being borne past for the last time, and the young ladies once more waved their handkerchiefs in salutation. It may be very gratifying and veiy triumphant to be borne aloft on other men's shoulders, but it is neither dignified, nor graceful, nor comfortable ; and Jabez, being carried off bare-headed, had neither hat nor cap to wave in return. He made o 2"], [204, "196 THE MANCHESTER MAN. the best use of his right hand, his left being required to steady himself, yet I am afraid he was more desirous to make a good impression on the romantic young lady muffled in a shawl, to hide the swath ing bandages, than on his less attractive and elder champion by her side. It was half -past twelve : the dinner-bell rang, Jabez was lowered to terra firma, and there was a general rush to the packing room, which had been cleared out to receive tressels and planks for tables, and an abundant supply of cold meat, cheese, bread and ale, provided by the master. And then and there, before a mouthful Avas cut, Mr. Ashton, standing at the head of the table, with Mr. Chadwick by his side, and Simon Clegg close at hand, presented Jabez with his indentures, with many ex pressions of his good will and his good opinion, and an intimation to those assem bled that Mr. Clegg would in all probability continue in his employ ; an announcement"], [205, "197 THE MANCHESTER MAN. which was received with loud acclaim ; and the hungry operatives set to at the colla tion with right good will. This was the master's feast ; that of the apprentice, for which it was customary to save up long in advance, was at night, and held at the neighbouring \" Concert- Hall Tavern\" in York Street, opposite to the then \" Gentlemen's Concert-Hall.\" Prior to that, however, Mrs. Ashton had somewhat to say to the young man, and she chose his own sitting-room to say it in. Of course, his apprenticeship over, it be hoved him to shift his quarters ; and he had looked forward to his abdication with regret undreamed of by Mrs. Ashton, or she would certainly have hesitated ere she made the proposal she did. As it was, she kindly and thoughtfully considered that Jabez had no good parental home to return to ; that she had no other use for the rooms he occupied, so she pro posed to him that he should continue to"], [206, "198 THE MANCHESTER MAN. occupy them whilst he thought fit, since he had elected to remain in their service. He had already looked at lodgings in Charlotte Street, close at hand; but this unexpected proposal came like a reprieve to an exile, and he was as prompt in his ac ceptance as he had been in that previous decision which had so thoroughly swamped all Mr. Chadwick's plans for his advance ment. His eager \" Oh, madam, you can not mean it ! you overwhelm me with kindness. Kemain under this roof ! It is a privilege I had not anticipated, and I shall be proud to embrace it !\" sent Mrs. Ashton away well pleased. It was doubly satisfactory to find the comforts of their home appreciated after seven years' experience, and to be able to refute Mr. Ashton's theory that \" all young men like to shake a loose leg, and Jabez would be too glad to escape from grum bling Kezia's jurisdiction to accept the offer.\""], [207, "199 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Mr. Ashton, however, did not abandon the opinion he had formed. \"I'll wager my gold snuff-box against a button-mould,\" asserted he, \"that Clegg only said 'Yes' because gratitude would not let him say ' Nay !' It's not likely a young man would care to be always under the eyes of a master or mistress, however steady he may be.\" Ah, but neither Mr. nor Mrs. Ashton knew there was a magnet under their roof, stronger than all the ordinary inducements which might otherwise have drawn him away : \u2014 and perhaps it was as well for him they did not. Simon, who was present at the time, seemed literally overpowered with gratitude for all the good which was falling into the lap of the child of his adoption. He, how ever, took his own views of the matter, views not calculated to puff Jabez up in his own esteem, and when Mrs. Ashton was gone, he broke out \u2014"], [208, "200 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" Oh, Jabez, lad ! but thah's lit on thi feet !

Nay, only that morning, in the flush of success he had carried from the counting-house, with the buoyant presumption of youth, a con viction that it was not so much a prayer as a prophecy nearing fulfilment. Simon brought his soaring pinions down from their Icarian flight. \" Well, lad, it may be ' the Lord has en large thi coast,' but if so be He han, thah sees theer's moore room fur thee to slip as well as to stond, and theer's moore"], [209, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 201 rayson whoi thah shouldn be thenkful and humble ; fur the big book says, ' Let him that stondeth tak' heed lest he fall,' an' aw shouldna loike t' see thi young yead torned wi' proide.\" His lecture was somewhat of a cold shower-bath to Jabez in his hour of triumph, but no doubt it was salutary in its ultimate effects. At all events, it kept the vaulting ambition of the new man a little in check. People \u2014 especially work-people \u2014 then observed early hours. At seven o'clock the outcome supper was on the tables at the \" Concert-Hall Tavern ;\" and the elder apprentices, and all such of the workmen as were absolutely engaged on the pre mises, were there to partake when Jabez found old Simon a seat, himself taking the head of the table, with the two senior apprentices on his right hand and left. The cost of such suppers usually fell on the apprentice, but sometimes, as in this"], [210, "202 THE MANCHESTER MAN. case, the master added his quota. If plain, the provision was substantial and ample. Bounds of beef and legs of mutton, piles of floury potatoes, and red cones of carrot on pale beds of mashed turnip, smoked on the board, and the two-pronged forks and horn hasted knives were flanked with earthen ware jugs and horns of ale. It was the first essay of Jabez in the art of carving, and no doubt he made rather an unskilful president. But in the then condition of the lower classes a large joint of meat was a rare sight to a working man, and so he cut away with no fear of critics. Amidst the rattle of cutlery and crockery, and the rapid play of jaws, beef and mutton disappeared, and were succeeded by a tre mendous plum-pudding \u2014 the contribution of old Mrs. Clowes \u2014 and half a cheese, which came to the table in the then common japanned receptacle locally known as a cheese-biggin. Appetite and the viands fled together,"], [211, "203 THE MANCHESTER MAN. the noise of tongues succeeded to the noise of knives and forks, and Lancashire humour vented itself in jest and repartee, some times coarse, but seldom mischievous. Old Simon enjoyed it immensely. It seemed like a renewal of his own youth. It was not, however, until the supper table was cleared that the chief ceremonial of the evening took place. Then an arm chair was hoisted upon the table, in which Jabez was enthroned, the two eldest ap prentices standing also on the table on either hand as supporters. An immense bowl of steaming punch was brought in, which was held over the head of Jabez by the one apprentice (when he was said to be crowned), whilst the other, wielding the punch-ladle as a symbol of authority, with many a theatrical grimace, began to ladle the odorous compound into the glasses of the guests ; and the head overlooker of the manufactory, from the opposite end of the table, prepared to propose the health of"], [212, "204 THE MANCHESTER MAN. the late apprentice, as a new member of their craft. At this juncture in walked their master, Mr. Ashton, closely followed by Mr. Chad wick, leaning on the arm of the Bev. Joshua Brookes, who, with many a \"pish!\" and \" pshaw !\" and \" pooh !\" had professed to come reluctantly, \"to see a sensible lad make a fool of himself.\" Their entrance, and the volley of cheers which greeted it, made a momentary pause in the proceed ings. Then Mr. Ashton, being duly sup plied with a ladles ul of punch, took his overlooker's place, and the glass serving as a substitute for his snuff-box, he proposed and drank \"Mr. Clegg's health and pros perity,\" and welcomed him among the con fraternity of small- ware weavers.

Chorus \u2014 Go round, go round,\" &c. Mr. Ashton had ordered up another bowl of punch, and that being distributed with like ceremony over the new small-ware monarch's head, Jabez, from his temporary throne, with all the warmth of freshly stimulated gratitude, delivered a very genu ine oration on the excellence of the master then present, and proposed as a toast \"Mr. and Mrs. Ashton, our worthy and esteemed master and mistress.\" Now-a-days I am afraid the master would have been dubbed a \" governor,\" and the*"], [214, "206 THE MANCHESTER MAN. mistress ignored altogether ; but though it is only fifty-five years since, servants were not ashamed to own they had masters and mistresses, and consequently were not above being amenable to rule. During this digression, at a hint from some one (I believe old Simon), Jabez, whose eloquence must surely have come from the punch-bowl, dilated on the spiritual relation between the reverend chaplain and the party assembled, there being scarcely an individual present who had not been either baptised or married by the Bev. Joshua Brookes ; and he wished \" health and long life to him \" writh much sincerity. A general shout rose in response, but Joshua made no other reply than to turn on his heel (the better to hide his face), and growl out, \" Long life indeed !

Yet,"], [215, "207 THE MANCHESTER MAN. in spite of his gruff disclaimer, he added another bowl of punch to the \" tomfoolery\" \u2014 at least, one was brought in soon after, and no one there was called upon to pay for it.

Jabez awakened the next morning with a terrible headache, and a dim recollection of having encountered stately Mrs. Ashton in the hall overnight, when the very statues had seemed to shake their heads at him, and her mild \" Fie, Jabez !\" followed him upstairs, apparently carpeted with moss or india-rubber for the nonce.

But he did not know it, and by the hail-fellow-well metishness of those workmen who were most inclined at all times to keep Saint- Monday, and who came to their work, or stayed from their work, unfit for their work, was a sensitive chord of his nature struck, far more than by the quiet caution of Simon, the light badinage of Mr. Ashton, or the jeers of captious Kezia.

Sterner grew its aspect as the shivering weeks counted themselves into months, and the shrinking waters spread first a thin film, then a thick and a thicker barrier of ice between them and the freezing atmo sphere. Every gutter had its slide, along which clattering clogs sped noiselessly ; every pool its vociferous throng of boys, and every pond its mingled concourse of skaters and sliders. Of these, the In firmary and Ardwick Green waters were"], [223, "215 THE MANCHESTER MAN. most patronised ; the former having the more numerous, the latter the more select body of skaters, and consequently the more fashionable surrounding of spectators. The amusements of the town were then on so limited and exclusive a scale that long frost was quite a boon to the younger portion of the community; and during the sixteen weeks of its continuance, the Green became a promenade gay with the warm hues of feminine attire, as ladies flocked to witness and extol the feats of husbands, brothers, cousins, or particular friends. There was no fear of vulgar overcrowding (except on Sundays) ; work ing-hours were long, and there were no Saturday half-holidays, so that only those whose time was at their own disposal could share the sport or overlook it. Amongst these, much to the annoyance of Mr. Aspinall, his son Laurence chose to enrol himself, with less regard to the fluc tuation of the cotton market, or the com-"], [224, "216 THE MANCHESTER MAN. parative value of American or East India staples, than the Cannon Street merchant thought necessary to fit him for his future partner or successor. The younger man had chosen to construe liberally the word \" gentleman,\" which had been the be-all and end-all of his training, and to regard elegant idleness as its synonym. What availed his fine figure and proficiency in arts and athletics, if he had no opportunity for the display of his person or his skill ? And to throw away the rare chance the Winter had provided was clearly to scorn the gift of the gods. Accordingly he spent more time on Ardwick Green Pond that in the counting house, varied occasionally with a visit to the Assembly Billiard-Boom in Back Mos ley Street, or a morning promenade in the Infirmary Gardens, from the open gates of which he generally contrived to emerge as Miss Ashton descended the steps from Mr. Mabbott's, and just in time to hand her"], [225, "217 THE MANCHESTER MAN. courteously and daintily across the road way, and bear her company to her own door, discoursing of recent assemblies or concerts, from the former of which she had hitherto been debarred, and of the last occasion on which he had \" the exquisite pleasure of seeing her at Ardwick Green \" \u2014 ocasions which were seldom reported at home, any more than the chance meetings on her way from Mr. Mabbott's ; and the reticence, be sure, boded no good. Dr. Hull had long ago advised \" out-door exercise \" for the rapidly growing girl, and there was no embargo on her walks abroad, Mrs. Ashton suspecting no danger, and no surreptitious meetings. Her visits to the Green during the long skating season were quite as unrestrained, except that an es cort became a necessity.

Suppose you lend me an arm along the slippery roads, and we go to meet them, eh ?\" The sparkling eyes of Jabez confirmed his ready tongue's \"With pleasure, sir,\" as, sensible of the honour done him, he left the sale-room, whistled his black friend Nelson from the yard, and they set off at a brisk pace, to keep the blood in circula tion, the dog leaping, bounding, and bark ing before them, in token of good fellow-"], [228, "220 THE MANCHESTER MAN. ship. As they passed the Infirmary pond, Jabez remarked that the ice began to look watery, to which Mr. Ashton replied, \" Yes ; I think Jack Frost's long visit is near its end, and there must be some truth in the old saw that ' a thaw is colder than a frost.' \" At that moment Mr. Aspinall's carriage roiled past them, bearing the merchant homewards in distinguished state (private carriages were by no means common), whereat Mr. Ashton observed with a shrug, \" How pride punishes itself ! Fancy a tall fellow like Mr. Aspinall cramped up in a stifling box upon wheels on a day like this when he has the free use of his limbs !\" Contrary to expectation, they did not come in sight of the ladies until they gain ed the Green, which they found a scene of wild hubbub and commotion ; skaters and spectators gathering towards the centre of the Green, whence came a confused noise"], [229, "221 THE MANCHESTER MAN. of voices shouting, crying, and screaming. The quick eye of Jabez was at once arrested by the figure of Augusta on the opposite bank, the centre of an appalled group, wringing her hands in the very im potence of terror, and as he penetrated the excited crowd, he saw the hatless head of a man, whose body was submerged, resting with its chin upon a ledge of the ice, which had apparently broken under him. At the first glance he failed to distinguish the head from the distance, and rushed for ward, apprehensive lest it should be that of either Mr. Walmsley or his friend Travis, whom he knew to be of the party. Becognition came accompanied by a shock that staggered him. If the ice had attractions for Aspinall and Walmsley, Ellen Chadwick had certainly as great attractions for Ben Travis ; but it is certain that neither cousins, nor mother, nor aunt were sensible that they had been drawn thither simply as a sort of decorous train to Miss Augusta"], [230, "222 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Ashton, whose inspiriting had in turn been the fascinating lieutenant, the most grace ful and accomplished skater on the pond. Perhaps she hardly knew it herself, not being given to searching her own heart for its motives.

Laurence had made the most of the occasion, glad of an opportunity to cultivate the acquaintance of the whole family, and display his graceful figure and his skill to the best advantage. Now and then he joined the Chadwicks and the Ashtons on the bank, anon darted off, wheeling hither and thither, so swift in his evolutions, the eye could scarcely follow him.

A small match will kindle a large flame if conbustibles be there. Fired by her too apparent satisfaction, and Mrs. Ashton's presence, his excessive vanity induced him to perform what, with the imperfect skates of the period, was a distinguished feat. He was ordinarily proud of his caligraphy. Now he wound and twisted, lifted his skates or dashed them down, until he had scored upon the ice an alphabet in bold capitals ; but whether he had miscalculated his space, or the strength of the ice \u2014 broken into for the use of cattle at the upper end \u2014 or the crowd of inquisitive or envious followers had been too great for its resistance, as he made the last curl of the letter Z, the ice gave way, and he was plunged in up to the neck, amid the shrieks of women and the shouts of men.

He trod the water, and it sustained him, but the ice would not. He was forced to content himself with the use of his hands beneath as paddles, to relieve the pressure on his chin, and wait for help which seemed an eternity in coming. He had been in the water some time when Jabez and Mr. Ashton appeared on the scene amongst women shrieking with affright, and men rushing about, without presence of mind, or paralysed to power lessness. Mr. Travis alone seemed to have a thought, and he had sent for ropes and hatchets to cut a way to him through the ice itself. But there was a question would his strength hold out ? \" Will no one save him ? Will no"], [233, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 225 one save him?\" cried Augusta piteously. \" Fifty pounds to him who will save my son !\" was the cry of the frantic father, who had witnessed the accident from his own carriage window. \" A hundred ! \u2014 two hundred pounds ! \u2014 five hundred pounds to anyone who will save him !\" \" It's noan a bit o' use, measter,\" said a working man, with a shake of his head. \" Men wunna chuck their lives aweay for brass ; an' yon ice is loike a pane o' glass wi' a stone through it.\" Unfortunately impulsive Ben Travis had darted forward to his rescue at the outset, and his ponderous weight had cracked the already broken ice in all directions. He had himself retreated with difficulty ; and now no offers of reward would tempt men to put their own lives in peril, though Kit Townley was there, urging others to the attempt, and Bob, the ex-groom, had rushed for ropes they had neither pluck nor skill to VOL.

Jabez looked at her strangely. His head seemed to spin. His face went livid as that on the ice. Had his secret devo tion no other end than this ? True, she had called him \" Jabez,\" but so she had called him in his servitude. She had ap pealed to him as one she trusted in implicit ly ; but the appeal sounded as made for one she loved, and that was not himself, but he who, as boy and man, had wounded him in soul and body. The very tone of her cry was as a knell to his hopes and him self. It was his foe and his rival who was perishing j Was he called upon to risk his life to warm a serpent to sting him again ? The conflict in his breast was sharp and terrible. \" If thine enemy hunger, give him food,\" seemed to float in his ears."], [235, "s THE MANCHESTER MAN. 227 There was a small gloved hand on his arm, a pale, sweet face looking up into his. The moments were flying fast. \" Oh ! Jabez, Jabez, do try !\" \" I will,\" said he hoarsely. Had he not often declared in his secret heart that he would give his life to serve her ? \u2014 and should he be ungenerous enough to shrink now ? \"It is folly to attempt. I forbid it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Ashton, laying her hand on his arm. And Ellen Chadwick, pale as Augusta, tried to stop him with \u2014 \" You must not ! you must not !

He hardly heard the words of cheer addressed to him. Two long ladders had been lashed side by side to give breadth of surface. These, by the help of cords and Nelson, whose sagacity was akin to reason, he drew across the cracked and gaping ice ; and crept slowly from rung to rung, watched from the land breathlessly, until he reached his almost insensible rival. With rapidly benumbing fingers he secured strong ropes beneath each shoulder, sending Nelson 7 O back to the bank with the main line, in case his own strength was inefficient to lift the dead weight of Laurence, or that"], [237, "229 THE MANCHESTER MAN. the ice should yield beneath the double weight. Some one sent a brandy-flask back by the dog. \" Can you swallow ?\" he asked. There was no answer, but a gurgle. He moistened the blue lips, while the head bent slightly back, introduced a small quantity of the potent spirit between his set teeth ; and, having warmed himself by the same means, essayed to lift the freezing skater, who was almost powerless to aid. But the latter with an extreme effort raised an arm above the ice, and grasped recum bent Jabez. And now Nelson proved his worth. He set his teeth in Aspinall's high coat-collar, and tugged until their united strength drew him upwards, and across the ladder sledge, almost as stiff and helpless as a corpse. To lessen the weight, Jabez crept from the ladders ; they were drawn to the side with their living freight before he himself"], [238, "230 THE MANCHESTER MAN. was out of danger ; for the heavy pressure and the swift motion set the ice cracking under him, and with extreme difficulty he dragged himself to the bank to sink down OO on the hardened snow, overcome by the strain of mind and muscle, whilst the approving crowd set up a shout, and Augusta Ashton thanked him tremulously. \"I'm afraid, Clegg, you've spent your strength for a dead man,\" said Travis, grasping his hand warmly, \"ancl Aspinall was scarcely worth it, alive or dead.\" But Jabez made no reply. He rose slowly and painfully, shook off the con gratulatory crowd of strangers and friends, on the plea of needing to \"warm and dry himself,\" refused point-blank to accept the grateful hospitality of Mr. Aspinall, and taking the proffered arm of Travis, turned towards the \" George and Dragon,\" as little like one who had done a noble action as could be imagined. Mr. Ashton followed, tapping his gold"], [239, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 231 snuff-box in wonder and perplexity. He saw that something was wrong, but knew not that Augusta's hasty thanks had closed the young man's heart against all but its own pain."], [240, "232 CHAPTEB XII. BLIND ! HO white, so cold, so still was the rigid figure borne from the pond to Mr. Aspinall's house, Travis might well count him \" a dead man,\" as the rumour ran con cerning him ; and feeble old Kitty set up a lamentation as over the dead. Mrs. Ashton, who knew that to be a home without a thinking woman at its head, voluntered her services, and entered the house with the bearers, leaving the trembling Augusta with their friends. She gently put the old woman aside, and felt pulse and heart. \"There is life,\" said she, \"and while"], [241, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 233 there is life there is hope. Keep tears until there is time to shed them ; now we must act.\" Then turning to the scared and scurrying servants, she gave her orders much as though she had been in her own warehouse, and with a stately authority there was no disputing. The butler was bidden to \" Bring brandy, quick !\" The footman was re quired to \" wheel this sofa to the fire, and pile up the coals !\" A maid was asked for \"hot blankets without delay ! \" and moan ing Kitty was set to work to \"help to strip her young master and chafe his limbs.\" And so promptly were her clear, cool orders obeyed that, when the doctor arrived in hot haste with Mr. Aspinall, half his work was done. The pulse had quick ened and the limbs began to glow, though the eyelids remained closed. Most grateful then was Mr. Aspinall for the efficient matronly service rendered to his motherless boy by the stately lady, who"], [242, "234 THE MANCHESTER MAN. was drawn nearer to him in his helplessness by her own kindly act than by all the con ciliatory visits and peace-offerings with which Laurence had himself sought to propitiate her. And for once Mr. Aspinall accepted a kindness as a favour, not as a tribute to his personal importance, and he placed his carriage at the disposal of Mr. Ashton and herself for their return home, without a sign of his usual self-inflation. His importance received a considerable shock, however, when he called at the house in Mosley Street the following day to report progress, and relieve himself of his obligation to his son's preserver by paying over the five hundred pounds he had in his extremity offered as a reward. \" I do not think Mr. Clegg will accept a reward,\" said Mr. and Mrs. Ashton in a breath. \" Not accept it !\" and the portly figure seemed to swell; \"five hundred pounds is a large sum for a young man in his posi-"], [243, "235 THE MANCHESTER MAN, tion ; only a fool or a madman would re fuse it.\" \" Just so, just so,\" replied Mr. Ashton, offering his open snuff-box to his visitor, whilst Mrs. Ashton stirred the fire as a sort of dubious disclaimer ; \" but I think, for all that, you will find we are right ; Mr. Clegg is not a common man, and is not actuated by common motives. \u2014 My dear ?\" He nodded, and Mrs. Ashton pull ed the bell-rope. Mulberry-suited James answered on the instant. \" Mr. Clegg is wanted.\" Mr. Clegg, labouring under the disad vantage of a cold caught the previous afternoon, to which any huskiness of voice might be attributed, obeyed the summons; He was presented duly to Mr. Aspinall, and, much to that gentleman's surprise, was in vited to take a seat. \" Absolutely invited to take a seat !\" as he afterwards recounted in indignation to"], [244, "236 THE MANCHESTER MAN. a friend; \"these Whigs have no respect for a gentleman's feelings !\" \u2022 Nor had Jabez. He was pale enough when he entered, but his face flushed, his lips compressed, and the scar on his brow showed vividly, as Mr. Aspinall drew forth a roll of crisp bank-notes from his pocket book, and loftily offered to him the reward he had \" earned by his bravery.\" He flushed, put back the notes with a movement of his hand, and said coldly, '\u2022 You owe me nothing, sir. The mean est creature on God's earth should have freely such service as I rendered to your son. I cannot set a price on life.\" \" But I offered the reward, and the fact is I must discharge the debt.

You owe me nothing. Let your son thank Miss Ashton for his life ; he is her debtor, not mine.\" The words seemed to rasp over a nutmeg-grater, they came so hoarsely, as did his request for leave to withdraw ; and he closed the door on the five hundred pounds, ancl on the smiles of husband and wife, before the rebuffed cotton-merchant could master his indignation to reply. The notes in his palm were light enough, but lying there they represented liberality contemned ; a debt unpaid ; an undischarg ed obligation to an inferior ; and not thrice their value in gold could have pressed so heavily on Mr. Aspinall as that last con sideration. The frigid manner of Jabez he construed into radical impudence; he re sented the salesman's repudiation of re ward as a personal affront, and did not scruple to express his views openly, then and there, winding up with a question which startled his interlocutors,"], [246, "238 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" What did the singular young man mean by his reference to Miss Ashton ?\" Had they followed the \"singular young man \" across the hall to the sanctuary of his own sitting-room, seen him dash him self down into a chair, and bury his head in his hands on the table, with unutterable anguish on his face, and heard burst from his lips \u2014 more as a groan than embodied thought \u2014 \" Oh, Augusta, adored Augusta, what a presumptuous madman I have been !\" \u2014 they would but have had half the answer. But had they mounted the polish ed oaken stairs to the dainty chamber where Augusta Ashton lay in bed with a \" cruel headache,\" brought on by the fright, and eyes red with weeping at the cata strophe which had befallen her adorable admirer the gallant lieutenant, and heard her half-audible lamentations, the answer might have been complete.

This was all the solution she had to offer Mr. Aspinall. In the excite ment of the accident and the rescue, she had overlooked Augusta's excessive emo tion, but now her mother's heart took alarm. Could it be that the younger eyes of Jabez had seen a preference for the handsome scapegrace which she had not ? The matter was talked over by husband and wife long after Mr. Aspinall had left ; and the anxious mother questioned the maiden in the privacy of her own room, to come thence with the sad conviction that Augusta had prematurely been led captive by a handsome face and a dashing air, ir respective of worth or worthlessness. Yet"], [248, "240 THE MANCHESTER MAN. she consoled herself and Mr. Ashton with the reflection, \" It is, after all, only a girl ish fancy, and will die out.\" \" Just so, and as the young rake is laid by the leg for one while, there is all the more chance,\" assented Mr. Ashton. \" If his immersion does not convert him into a hero,\" added the matron, with a clearer knowledge of her daughter. Yet neither asked themselves how the intuitive perception of Jabez came to be more acute than their own, nor what power impelled him to risk his life for an enemy at the mere bidding of Augusta. Indeed they set the hazardous exploit down to the score of magnanimity and bravery only. Equally unobservant were they of Ellen Chadwick's remonstrance, or her feverish watch of every perilous turn Jabez and Nelson had taken on the ice, or of the caresses she lavished on the dog when all was over.

She had looked up to him, trusted him, clung to him ; and though she was as a star in his firmament, he had had a sort of vague impression that the star which shone upon him from afar would draw nearer, and, as he rose to it, come down to meet him.

It was remarkable that on these occa sions, whether they took their way up Ancoats, or Dale Street, or Piccadilly, or Garret Boad, they would eventually be led so near to Ardwick Green that it would have been unkind had not Mr. Travis \"just stepped across to see how Mr. Laurence progressed.\" And so, too, whenever she went abroad with Cicily at her heels, or when Cicily was sent on errand, nothing would content her imperative young mistress but that she should hasten (whether in her way or out"], [262, "254 THE MANCHESTER MAN. of it), with \" Mrs. Ashton's compliments,\" to ascertain the condition of the invalid scapegrace.

Public events march on irrespective of private joys or sorrows, and no individual goes out into the world after three months' seclusion to find things just as he left them.

Close shut in the carriage which Mr. Ashton lightly designated a box, he was driven down Market Street, to dis cover that the Spirit of Improvement, \" fell"], [264, "256 THE MANCHESTER MAN. bane of all that's picturesque,\" had touched the ancient, many-gabled, black and white houses with which his earliest recollections were associated, and they were crumbling into dusty ruins before the potent incan tation \" Space.\" It was the beginning of a very necessary widening of the main thoroughfares of the growing commercial metropolis ; but the blanks in the narrow street took Laurence by surprise. There was a newspaper the more for his restored sight to scan, albeit the Manchester Guardian, which Jeremiah Garnett and John Edward Taylor first gave to the world on the fifth of May, was scarcely likely to take his view of party politics, or of his share in the Peterloo massacre, which was still a disturbing element in the town. Just now the paper, which he found at the perru quier's, was given over to the discussion of the approaching coronation of George IV., which likewise formed the theme of conver sation, not only at the wig-maker's, but"], [265, "257 THE MANCHESTER MAN. whithersoever he turned when once more presentable. Somehow, though he found his way to the warehouse, and the cockpit, and the Assembly Billiard Club, and to Tib Street, where Bob the groom had a pretty daughter very much at the young man's disposal, he did not present himself at his Mosley Street friend's as soon as might have been ex pected, considering all things ; and Au gusta, in the most becoming of morning robes, watching with eager expectation for his coming, began to pant and chill with the sickness of hope deferred. He was by no means the only admirer of the lovely heiress, and was sufficiently desirous to complete his conquest before other com petitors were fairly in the field ; but he was in perplexity how to deal with Jabez Clegg, who stood in his way after another sort. He was grateful\u2014 after a fashion \u2014 for the preservation of his life ; but ungrateful, in asmuch as Jabez was the preserver. VOL.

It would be a feather in his cap to have a thanksgiving letter of mine to exhibit.\" Having at length determined his course, Mr. Laurence betook himself to Mosley Street, made his bow duly and gracefully to Mrs. Ashton and the young lady, keeping the hand of the latter as long within his own as etiquette would permit, and sending the warm blood mantling to her cheek, with a supplicating glance of devotion as potent as words. Then, with some little prolixity, he professed his desire to \" thank his noble preserver \" for the life he had saved; and at his request Mr. Clegg (whom he might just as well have thanked in the warehouse without ceremony) was sent for. s2"], [268, "260 THE MANCHESTER MAN.

Both Augusta and her mother noted the contrast between the elegant manner, suave tones, and rounded periods of Lau rence Aspinall's thanks and the curt dis claimer of Jabez, though their deductions were different. Augusta was in raptures with the rose-giver. \" Ah ! my dear, all is not gold that glitters. There is more sterling metal in your father's salesman, mark my words, than in the tinselled lieutenant,\" was the summing-up of the elder, as she replaced cake and wine in side-board and cellaret."], [269, "261 THE MANCHESTER MAN. She was clearly no friend to Aspinall now that he had recovered sense and sight. The town, which had been strong and outspoken in its condemnation of the new king during the trial of Queen Caroline, was now all alive with preparations to celebrate his coronation with befitting mag nificence, one branch of trade vying with another which should make the greatest display in the coming procession to the Green, the like of which never had been, and never would be again. And this competition, productive of marvellous re sults, due, in a great measure, to trade rivalry and an ambitious desire to outshine, was set down by historians, rightly or wrongly, as a proof of the excessive loyalty of the Mancestrians. In all classes, from the highest to the lowest, something was being done, and nothing was talked of, thought of, dreamed of, but the coronation and the procession. In courts and alleys there were making and"], [270, "262 THE MANCHESTER MAN. mending and washing, and no little pinch ing was undergone by hard-working fathers and mothers to provide the girls with white cambric frocks, tippets, and net caps, or the lads with fresh jackets and breeches and shoes, so as not to disgrace the Sunday schools under whose banners they were to walk. The finest horses of the Old Quay Company and Pickford's were put into new harness and the finest condition, and every lurry (a long, flat, sideless waggon) was called into requisition. Smiths, saddlers, sign and scene painters, were at work day and night for weeks ; and such was the request for banners that ladies undertook the work when skilled labour was not to be found. The important ceremony was fixed for the 19th of July. On the 17th a deputa tion of small-ware weavers waited on Mr. Ashton in despair. They could get neither flag nor banner ; the painter had"], [271, "263 THE MANCHESTER MAN. thrown over the order at the last moment. \" An' Tummy Worthington's getten a foine un, measter. It'll be a sheame an' a disgrace to us o' if we let Worthington's cut us eawt.\" [The said Worthington was a rival small- ware manufacturer]. Mr. Ashton had recourse to his snuff box, and then to his wife. \"My dear, what is to be done ? There will be no flag. The painters cannot execute the jobs in hand. Worthington's have a fine one, I hear.\" \" No flag ! That will never do. We must have a flag. Let me consider.\" Ellen Chadwick was busy helping Au gusta to make favours for the men. She looked up. \" Do you not think Mr. Clegg could paint you one ?\" she suggested.

It would be a pity to disappoint the men,\" answered he. \" And nothing beats trying but doing !\" added Mrs. Ashton. Silk and colours were procured. There was no leisure for complex design or elaboration. At that time the dark blue covers of the Dutch tapes in gross bore the symbolic device of the flax plant within a rude scroll. This Jabez transferred in colours to his silk on a colossal scale, both sides bearing the same emblem of their trade, more effective on its completion than any elaborate work. He had bargained to be left without interruption. The men fidgeted about the warehouse in a state of nervous trepidation (it was an important matter to them), but at dawn on the 19th it was finished, and borne off by the weavers in triumph <and exultation."], [273, "265 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Market Street Lane being in ruins at one end, and a narrow gully at the other, Mosley Street became the natural course for the procession (two miles and a half in length) from Peter's Field to the Green, where a royal salute was to be fired ; and like every other house on the line of route, Mr. Ashton's was filled with guests, and from garret to basement every window had its streamer, and was crowded with gaily dressed spectators, mostly feminine, the gentlemen of the town taking part in the procession, officially or otherwise. The Chadwicks and Mrs. Walmsley were there of course, and Mrs. Clough amongst others ; and on another floor Jabez \u2014 who being above the warehousemen, and not a master, did not walk \u2014 had as a companion good Bess Hulme, who with her husband had come over from Whaley-Bridge, where there was of course a holiday.

At the head of these came two figures, O / representing Adam and Eve, in a perfect bower of greenery, as representatives of the primitive condition before dress was invented. They were followed by a lurry, on which tailors (whose art is the first on record) sat cross-legged, and stitched and pressed, as if on a shopboard, whilst a select band of journeymen walked after, bearing miniature garments on wands, or ferruginous geese and sleeveboards. The blacksmiths wrought on their anvil, and carried also on long poles, horse-shoes, &c. The brass and copper smiths, likewise at work, had a bright array of kettles, candlesticks, and a mounted man in armour, as had also the tin-plate workers. The glass-blowers made a goodly array, and gave away tokens as they went. The men wore hats and caps brittle and brilliant, with wavy plumes of spun glass, whilst"], [276, "268 THE MANCHESTER MAN. birds, ships, goblets, and decanters on their poles glistened in the beams of the hot sun. A printing-press distributed appropriate verses, worked off in the course of the procession. And St. Crispin's followers waxed their threads and plied their awls on boots and shoes as they and their benches were borne along, followed by their leather aproned fraternity, holding aloft their pro ductions, from the most gigantic of Wel lingtons to the tiniest infant's slipper. All branches of the cotton trade were represented. There was cotton in bags ; twist in bales ; carding, roving, spinning, weaving, all going on under the eyes of the onlookers, with the workpeople following in their best and brightest. Shouts and hurrahs attended the whole line of march, not wholly unaccompanied by hisses ; but as the small-ware weavers passed Mr. Ashton's the cheers were deafening. A loom was at work weaving lengths of binding for garters, on which"], [277, "269 THE MANCHESTER MAN. was inwoven \" God save King George IV.,\" with the date, and these were lifted on long J o wands to the ladies at the windows on their way, or scattered to others in the street ; and as Tom Hulme caught the eye of Jabez, he pointed proudly to their banner, which had no rival in all the elaborately painted flags waving in the wind, and the im promptu artist was well satisfied. But the brightest day has its cloud.

As in most of the private houses along the line of route, a cold collation had been prepared for the refreshment of the friends who crowded Mr. Ashton's open windows. But no calculation had been made of the space the unwonted pageant would cover, or the time it would occupy in passing ; and Mrs. Ashton, having discovered that sight-seeing in the dust and glare of July was parching and fatiguing, issued orders for tea to be handed round when the last banner had disappeared, and before her less intimate friends should rise to depart. In giving these orders, she unwittingly stirred the kitchen fire into a white heat. Lavish hospitality was a characteristic of the time, and when a family of good position professed to keep \" open house,\" it was generally equal to the most extrava gant demands. But, as a rule, Mrs. Ashton had little leaning towards impromptu parties, and Kezia considerably less, pre ferring those grand and formal receptions"], [280, "272 THE MANCHESTER MAN. which involved elaborate preparation, and placed imaginary feathers in the caps of mistress and maids. Kezia herself considered the honour of the house involved in everything under her control being \" in apple-pie order ;\" and the surprise which put her on her mettle, put her also in a fume. Becalled from the window \u2014 whence her head had been poked far as the farthest \u2014 to provide tea and its concomitants for an indefinite number of strangers, she accom panied her erratic movements about her domain with explosive outbursts of spleen at \" bein' takken unawares when nowt's ready to hand.\" \" Here's missis bin an' ordered tay fur th' whole boilin' of folk up-stairs ; an' theer's Cicily and t'other wenches a' agog ower th' crownation, an' not worth 'toss of a pancake !\" She jerked out her anger in the ears of Bess Hulme, who, seated on the settle, had"], [281, "273 THE MANCHESTER MAN. just lulled to sleep Mrs. Walmsley's crying baby, which (neglected by its gaping nurse) had commemorated the day by a fall from a high bed. Bess made a temporary couch for the baby in a snug corner, and quietly came to Kezia's assistance ; then Ellen Chadwick, intuitively perceptive of kitchen troubles, busied herself in bringing reserves of china, glass, plate, linen, and sweetmeats from closets and store-room ; Cicily and Dolly came down in due time ; and the credit of the establishment lost nothing in Kezia's hands, even though there was an additional influx of visitors, and a supper also to provide. That was Mr. Ashton's affair. He had tired of his processional march in the broil ing sun by the time they had skirted Ard wick, and defiled into Chancery Lane.

The gentlemen's requirement, \"a draught of ale,\" was soon supplied, accompanied by a spasmodic comment on the \" grand display,\" and the exhibition of a pah* of the loyally inscribed fillets she had secured as the smallware-weavers passed. \"By-the-by, that was a wonderfully effective banner of yours, Mr. Ashton,\" in-"], [283, "275 THE MANCHESTER MAN. terposed the thin voice of Liverseege. \"Who painted it?\" \"A young fellow in my employ, who occasionally designs for us,\" answered Mr. Ashton, handing his snuff-box to the group in rotation \u2014 \" quite a self-taught artist !\" \"Indeed! It was not much like an amateur's brush. I should like to know him. You see I do something in that way myself.\" The young painter, conscious of .\u2666. his own latent power, was sensitively alive to undeveloped art in another. \" Would you ? Just so ! Then you shall. Come along, all of you, and finish the day wdth us. Mrs. Ashton will find us a dish of tea, and I am sure, Mrs. Green, she will be proud to see you also.\" Turn ing to the gentlemen, who had by this time emptied their talboy glasses, he added, \" And I think I have a few bottles of rare old port waiting among the cobwebs for us to drink the King's health.\" It was a period of much pressing and T 2"], [284, "276 THE MANCHESTER MAN. many excuses, but the excitement of the day had so far destroyed ceremony that even Mrs. Green, who was somewhat punc tillious, after a little nervous trepidation anent the fitness of her last new cap for company, consented, and accepted the arm Mr. Ashton gallantly offered to pilot her across the crowded streets, along which the tail of the procession had only just trailed. Graciously, though with her natural stateliness, Mrs. Ashton received the new comers ; Mrs. Green, finding the company generally in morning visiting dress, was at ease about her cap ; the tea was ex hilarating ; the viands toothsome ; the wines excellent ; there was one common topic for discussion ; the ice of ceremony had thawed hours before ; and genial Mr. Ashton, having locked the doors to pre vent the escape of a guest before the supper he had bespoken was demolished, was thoroughly in his element."], [285, "277 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Mrs. Ashton was not quite so much at ease, though she was too well-bred to manifest her disquiet, which had two sources. In the first place, the presump tuous salutation of Augusta by Lieutenant Aspinall had jarred a sensitive nerve. In the second, Mr. Ashton, generously impul sive, had introduced Mr. Clegg to their friends, and as a friend of whom he was himself proud. She thoroughly appreciat ed Jabez, and equally contemplated his advancement ; but she was for \" making no more haste than good speed,\" and con sidered it more prudent to raise him by insensible degrees. And as she watched her husband, radiant with good-will, cross the room with Jabez (discomposed at the very doorway by the wondering eyes of Augusta), and present him to Mr. Green and Mr. Liverseege, thus ran her thoughts : \u2014 \" Dear me ! William is very inconsider ate ! He will turn the young man's head,"], [286, "278 THE MANCHESTER MAN. and insult our visitors at the same time. I hope Mrs. Clough will not recognise him. How indignant she would be if she thought we expected her to associate with one who once wore her son's cast-off clothes ! Certainly he is well-conducted, and worthy in all respects, but \u2014 people don't forget such things ! If Mr. Green and Mr. Mc- Connell only knew William was introducing our Blue-coat apprentice what would they say ? \u2014 I am glad, however, to see young Mr. Liverseege so affable with Jabez.\" To her surprise, at this juncture, Mr. McConnell drew his chair close to Jabez and Mr. Liverseege, and attributing the evident embarrassment of the former to the newness of his position, endeavoured to dissipate it by taking part in the con versation, to which quiet Mr. Green occasionally added a word. The lady, who was so afraid of touching the dignity of her friends, had not heard her less exclusive lord whisper to the two cotton-spinners,"], [287, "279 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" I'm afraid I've committed a grave mis demeanour in Mrs. Ashton's sight, by bringing young Clegg among our party ; but kings are not crowned every day, and I thought it a good opportunity to bring a worthy lad out.

He was made to rise, sirs.\" Mr. Ashton's friends nodded in acquies cence, and willing to humour their kindly host, and perhaps desirous to test the calibre of an aspirant so introduced, wittingly or unwittingly did their part in helping him to \"rise\" by the very distinction of their prolonged attention. It was an act quite in the way of John McConnell, who had already given a lift to his rising young countryman, Fairbairn the engineer. Presently Mr. Chadwick, beckoning at tentive Ellen to his side, and using her"], [288, "280 THE MANCHESTER MAN. shoulder as a support, involuntarily second ed his brother-in-law by joining the group, and, putting out his hand to Jabez (who rose at his approach, and offered his own seat to the paralytic gentleman), said \u2014 \" Wha-at inter-rests yo-you so m-much, M-Mr. Clegg, th-that you f-forget old f-friends ?\" \" No, Sir, I had not forgotten you, nor Miss Chadwick either (Ellen coloured), \"but Mr. Ashton having honoured me with an introduction to Mr. Liverseege and these gentlemen\" (bowing to them), \"I was not at liberty to break away, had I felt so disposed.\" \" We were discussing the influence of art on our local manufactures,\" added Henry Liverseege, and thereupon the sub ject was resumed, Ellen necessarily in close attendance on her father, standing there with sparkling black eyes, an animated and attentive listener, well pleased that Mr."], [289, "281 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Clegg's merits (as seen by her) had at length found recognition. Meanwhile Augusta, the centre' of a group of young people, indulged in senti mental chit-chat, and trifling with her fan, and human hearts, completed the enslave ment of her last admirer, a fair-haired Mr. Marsland ; while Jabez, from his distant seat, looked and longed in vain. Cards were, as a matter of course, pro posed for the amusement of this extempo rised party ; and in filling up tables for whist or loo, Mrs. Ashton's fears for the sensibility of her friends were forgotten. They were utterly put to the rout by a loud rat-tat-tat at the street-door, followed by the entrance of Mr. Clough and the Beverend Joshua Brookes, the latter less vigorous than of yore, but in a state of un usual excitement. His loud voice was heard before he was seen. \" Hogs, sir, hogs ! They are no better than hogs, sir !\" he was saying even as he came into the"], [290, "282 THE MANCHESTER MAN. drawing-room. He appeared too much ruffled to respond composedly to the kind ly greetings of his many friends ; even Augusta, who put forth her little white hand with her most winning smile, attract ed no more attention than a hurried \" How d'ye do, lass ? How d'ye do ?\" \"What is the matter, Mr. Brookes? You seem \" He interrupted Mr. Ashton's inquiry with \u2014 \" Matter, sir ? Waste and riot, intem perance and indecency, are the matter. These old eyes have seen that which is enough to bring a curse upon the corona tion and a blight upon the town.\" Conversation was arrested, flirtation forgot its part, cards were laid down, save by three or four inveterate players, and young and old were alike on the qui vive, crowding round the speaker. \" Permit me,\" said Mr. Clough, com mencing an explanation. \" I suppose you"], [291, "283 THE MANCHESTER MAN. are all aware that the new market in Shude Hill is the chief station of the nine ap pointed for the distribution of meat, bread,. and ale to the populace ?\" \" Populace, indeed ! \u2014 the very scum and dregs of the town \u2014 say rather the lowest, roughest rabble !\" broke in old Joshua. \" Well, Parson, for the credit of our working population, let us hope so,\" chimed in Mr. Clough, resuming \u2014 \" Whilst Mr. Brookes and I were at tea in his sanctum, Tabitha ran in breathless to tell us that the platform erected for recipients in front of the storehouse had given way, that several persons were injured, and one had been killed on the spot. \" Ah !\" said the Parson, drawing a long breath between his teeth, while Jabez, unobserved by either, drew nearer to listen, and the ladies put up their hands in horror. \" It was not our most direct route, but either curiosity or compassion took us round by Shude Hill Market on our road"], [292, "284 THE MANCHESTER MAN. hither, and never shall I forget the scene we witnessed.

Only the commonest curs would have yelped and scrambled and struggled and fought for their rations, as did the human beasts we saw clutching and gripping from weaker women and children that which had fallen within their reach, or trampling in the mud underfoot the food they were too greedy or too drunk to devour. Ay, mud, for the very kennels ran with ale thrown in pitchers-full amongst the people, to be caught in hats, and bonnets, and hollowed hands, as if it were rain in an African desert.

I say again they are hogs, absolute hogs !\" As Joshua paused to take breath, aud sank into a chair, Jabez modestly put the question to the excitable chaplain \u2014 \"Do you not think the distributors are most to blame for this wanton waste and excess, to say nothing of the loss of life ? Surely the arrangements of the committee must have been defective.\" The Parson's harsh tones softened as he put out his hand to grasp the speaker's. \" Ay, Jabez, lad, is that thee ? I'm glad to see thee here \" \u2014 and he laid emphasis on the word \u2014 \" Ay, the dis tributors are answerable for \" But the personal recognition had created"], [294, "286 THE MANCHESTER MAN. a diversion. The question Jabez had mooted was talked over by separate knots of individuals in different quarters of the large room, whilst Mr. Clough, to Mrs. Ashton's amazement, yes, and gratification also, shook the salesman warmly by the hand, and congratulated him on his apparent success. Moreover, he bore him away to Mrs. Clough, at the loo-table, and called her attention to the change time had effected in the old tanner's foster child, in the most cordial manner. Thanks to Mr. Ashton, Mr. Clegg had truly got his first foot into Manchester society that coronation-day, and his old hopes might have revived, had not a dis turbing element crept into the room during the denunciatory oration of his clerical friend.

The lustre of that evening's introduction was dimmed for Jabez. Augusta scarcely looked at him as she brushed past to sup per, leaning on the arm of Lieutenant Aspinall, her white dress in strong contrast to his dark uniform ; and no doubt his pain was pictured on his face, for Ellen Chad wick sighed, as she too passed him with her martial cavalier, and half turned to look pitifully as she went. There was no lack of ladies, so Mrs."], [296, "288 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Ashton paired Mr. Clegg off with a chatty damsel of thirty or thereabouts, and he did his best to listen and make himself agreeable, but not even the novelty of his situation could keep his thoughts or his eyes from wandering where they should not. Along the whole course of the procession the Manchester Yeomanry had been greet ed with more hisses and groans than cheers. This had chafed their noble spirits, and on disbanding they had sought consolation in the wine-cup, which temperate Jabez was not slow to observe, although their degree of exhilaration was not then considered a disqualification for the drawing-room or for the society of ladies. Mr. Ashton's strong home-brewed sup per-ale was not a sedative, yet still Augusta smiled on Laurence, in spite of her mother's frowns, driving Mr. Marsland to despera tion, and Jabez to despair. Indeed, he was glad when the repast was"], [297, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 289 over, for then Joshua Brookes rose to depart, sober as when he sat down, and the Chadwicks also. He had thus an oppor tunity of escaping from his torment, by offering his escort to tottering Mr. Chad wick and the Parson in succession, if the latter did not object to the slight detour. Jabez foresaw that Mr. Travis was ready to do Miss Chadwick suit and service ; but in offering his arm to assist the slow feet of the disabled father, he little dreamed how gladly the daughter would have made an exchange, nor, had he been wiser, would he have thrust himself in big Ben's way, any more than would Mrs. Chadwick who openly favoured the \" personable and unim peachable \" captain.
