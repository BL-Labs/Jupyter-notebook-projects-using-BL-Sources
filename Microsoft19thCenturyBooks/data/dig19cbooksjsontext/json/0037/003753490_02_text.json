Life had floAved on very placidly during these months for Honor and her young ward. They had gone abroad for a feAV weeks, and had then settled down to the routine of Avork and study and quiet pleasures which their position entailed. Mrs. StedAvorth took the keenest inter- VOL. II.

But she had other inter ests besides those of designing and mak ing art fabrics. Her husband's AA7ard, from the first an object of tender regard, had daily Avound herself more closely round her heart, and the endeavour to give Dolores eA7ery ad\\-antage and eA'ery plea sure that money and love could procure her, absorbed much of her time and thoughts. Dolores Avas noAv sixteen-and-a-half, and, though curiously childlike in voice and manner, Avas more developed in appearance than girls of her age usually are. She was tall, Avith slender, beautifully-formed feet and hands, and a graceful, pliant, yet re markably dignified figure. Her features were almost faultless, and her eyes were"], [13, "WHERE THE BROOK AND RIVER MEET. 3 of a softness and brilliancy, such as are rarely seen in combination. She Avas too tall and Avomanly noAv to wear her hair doAvn her back, and she gathered it in a loose soft coil near the top of her head, leaving exposed the thick parting Avhence it rippled backAvard except Avhere it fell in a few soft tendrils OA7er her temples. ' Just a coujde of years more,' Arthur Avould say, looking at her as she sat on a Ioav chair by the AvindoAv, singing to her guitar, ' and she will have the Avoman's soul Avhich is all that is needed to make her a perfectly beautiful Avoman.' Her voice Avas fulfilling the utmost ex pectations that had been formed of it, and for the last six months she had been study ing singing under the best master Daning ham could afford. In the spring Honor intended to take her to London to have lessons from some first-rate teacher, but B 2"], [14, "4 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. for the present, the organist of Daningham, AA7ho was a thorough musician, could be trusted not to let her acquire any habits that she would have afterAvards to un- learn. She was singing iioav on this bright Sep tember day, singing from sheer lightness of heart, for the next day she AA-as going on a visit to the M'Donalds. She had paid them a visit the year before, when Honor's deep mourning had prevented her from soino- too, and iioaa7 she Avas once more o-oino- alone, for Honor Avas under a lon^ standing promise to take three of the little Lelands to the sea at this particular time. She AA7as A'exed about it. She had a strange dislike of letting Dolores go to the M'Don alds without her, and yet she did not feel justified in refusing to let her go. They AA7ere so very kind to the girl, AA7ho in re turn AA-as so warmly attached to them that"], [15, "WHERE THE BROOK AND RIVER MEET. 5 it did not seem justifiable to throw cold Avater on the friendship. ' She might need friends some day if I should be taken from her,' Honor remarked to Arthur, in discussing the subject, ' and it is absurd to suppose it can be good for her to be always Avith me, and yet ' ' My oavii feeling,' said Arthur, as she paused, ' is that to be ahA7ays AA7ith you is the best education any young girl can have. But no doubt you are right theoretically, and in any case it is settled now. She must go this time. I don't suppose a fortnight of Mrs. M'Donald Avill do her much harm.' These eighteen months had Avrought little change in Honor. She had laid aside her Avidow's cap, and in her plain, black dress looked very much like the girl to whom Mr. Stedworth had broken the neAvs of her father's death some tAvo-"], [16, "6 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. and-a-half years previously. She stood by the table, arranging some floAvers in a big glass, Avhile Dolores, perched on the sill of the open window, the red and yellow ribbons of her guitar flying in the breeze, sang a merry little French song, Avith a gleeful lightheartedness that filled the room Avith sunshine. The door opened, and Mr. Stanton was announced. Honor's face lighted up Avith a smile as she turned to him. Dolores nodded, and went on with her song. When it AAras finished, she said, ' What brings you here ? I thought you were going to a garden-party this afternoon ?' ' So I Avas, and so I am going, by-and by. But I thought it Avas my duty, as your guardian, to come and lecture you a little before you start on your travels into the world.'"], [17, "WHERE THE BROOK AND RIVER MEET. 7 Dolores left the AvindoAv-sill, and came and sat on the arm of Honor's chair, put ting her hand round the elder Avoman's neck, and resting her cheek on the sleek, auburn head, ' Go on,' she said, saucily, ' I'm ready.' But he gave her no lecture, after all. He chaffed her a little, according to his custom, and then began to talk to Honor ; and, as Dolores often remarked Avith some petulance, Avhen these two began to talk they never seemed to know where to stop. On this occasion Arthur had come to ask a sirvour. His sister had been ill. The doctors had ordered change of air for her. His mother was not able to leave home, and he had thought, if Mrs. Stedworth did not mind Nellie going to the same sea-side place where she was going to take the young Lelands, it would be nice for the poor girl."], [18, "8 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. ' My dear Arthur,' cried Honor, ' do let her join my party. It will be so very much pleasanter for me, and I can look after her a bit \u2014 and you Avill be obliged to come sometimes to see her, so I shall score. He smiled. ' In any case, I should have come to see hoAV you and the children got on.' After a little more discussion this Avas settled, and Arthur took his leave, to proceed to his garden-party. ' Try to be good Avhile you are aAvay,' he said, Avith a laugh, to Dolores, ' and don't get into any mischief.' The folloAving day Dolores departed with Susan, Avho Avas noAv much more her maid than Honor's. Honor saAV her off at the station, and restrained Avith difficulty Gib's desire to accompany her.

' It Avouldn't do for you to come. You'd be jealous of Boris.' Boris Avas the Irish setter at Glendare, whom Dolores always considered her oavii exclusiA'e property. A great disappointment awaited her on this occasion Avhen she arrived at Glen- dare. Her first question, after the usual greetings, Avas for Boris. ' I am sorry to say, dear,' replied Mrs. M'Donald, ' that Boris has disappeared. He ran aAvay tAvo days ago, and nothing has been heard of him. It is A7ery tire some, as there is a rumour of a mad dog haA7ing been seen about.' Dolores Avas plunged in despair. She resigned herself, hoAvever, after a time,"], [20, "10 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. and took Avhat consolation she could out of little Neil, AA7ho had grown into a pretty little fellow of three years old, very soft and white, Avith a sturdy pair of legs, a grave silent manner, a calm determination ahvays to have his OAvn Avay, and as divine a smile as ever that broke at unexpected moments over his serious little face, and transformed it into the face of an angel. There was another old friend of Dolores at Glendare. This Avas Mr. de Lacy Elli son, Avho was as much given as before to fantastic coats, and eA7en more giA'en than before to paying Dolores compliments. Indeed, he professed himself perfectly enraptured by her beauty, and raved about it to anybody Avhom he could induce to listen. ' She is exquisite, perfect !' he exclaimed to Mrs. M'Donald, the first evening after dinner, as Avith his head on one side and"], [21, "WHERE THE BROOK AND RIVER MEET. 11 an expression of profound criticism on his face he surveyed Dolores, who, in a simple AA7hite dress, bent over her guitar-case. ' I really do not think, my dear lady, that there is a single improvement I could AA7ish to make in her.' But Avhen she seated herself, guitar on knee, and sang a tender rippling Italian love-song, his ecstasy kneAv no bounds. He Avent over to the girl and began to com pliment her in the high-floAvn language he considered appropriate to his A7elvet coat and sapphire studs. And Dolores smiled in answer. She thought his dress and his mode of expressing his sentiments ridicu lous, but AAnth the sentiments themselves she found no fault. At sixteen-and-a-half a girl's Avomanly vanity is Avell aAvake. So she sang more songs at his request, and her cheek flushed and her dark eyes brightened, and she Avent to her room that night real-"], [22, "12 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. izing for the first time that it is a pleasant thing to be beautiful. But before she slept she Avrote to Honor ; and her letter contained, besides an account of Mr. de Lacy Ellison's compliments, a confession of her own pleasure. ' You Avill say, dear Honor, that I ought not to be so vain. But is it really Avrong to like being pretty, and to like to know people think you pretty ? You and Arthur never told me I Avas pretty. I wonder if you think so ?' Honor smiled and sighed as she read this epistle, and Avished for the hundreth time she had not let the child go. Of course, she must go through the ordeal of the flattery and admiring worship of many men, but she should not be exposed to it so soon. Mrs. M'Donald took quite a different vieAV of the case. Mr. de Lacy Ellison's"], [23, "WHERE THE BROOK AND RUVER MEET. 13 enthusiasm for Dolores delighted her. She thought it might, Avith encouragement, turn to a genuine passion. He had ten thousand a year, and Dolores laboured under disadvantages. He Avould be a first rate match for her, and Mrs. M'Donald Avas resolved that no encouragement on her part should be Avanting. Accordingly, the folloAving day, Avhen after lunching on the moor Avith the shoot ers, Mr. de Lacy Ellison expressed a desire to Avalk doAA7n to a particular spot Avhere a good sketch Avas to be made, his hostess agreed Avith alacrity to his further proposal that Dolores should accompany him. ' I am not equal to the Avork myself,' she said, ' but it will do Miss Dare good. I suppose I can trust you to take care of her ?' ' With my life,' returned the painter, laying his hand upon his heart."], [24, "14 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. Accordingly the party separated. The shooters betook themselves to another part of the moor, Mrs. M'Donald returned to the house in the little pony-cart that had brought her and Dolores and the luncheon up, and Mr. de Lacy Ellison and Dolores turned their steps towards a point some tAvo miles distant, Avhere an overhanging rock looked doAvn on the river, and gave a lovely vieAV of the valley. Dolores had no reason iioav to complain that Mr. de Lacy Ellison treated her like a child. His extreme deference delighted her, and made her tolerant of his follies. He discoursed much on art and beauty as they Avalked along, and, when they reached the place he meant to sketch from, he gave her quite a lecture upon the principles of lands cape-draAA7ing.

A little stream that had started someAvhere on the hill-top came tumbling down through a miniature ravine, some times foaming and rushing over steep rocks, sometimes floAving comparatiA7ely Avide and deep and calm for some distance along a level bit of land. Dolores Avandered on heedless of the Avay, pausing iioav and then to Avatch a squirrel dart up a tree and jjeep at her with its bright eyes from behind the trunk, or to pick a handful of the delicate lilac blue blossoms Avhich in England she had been taught to call harebells, but Avhich here she had learned to knoAv as the true blue-"], [26, "16 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. bells of Scotland.

But no fear suggested itself to her. ' Boris,' she cried, in accents of delight, ' dear old Boris.' She sprang to her feet and ran to meet her pet. In another moment she Avould have throAvn her arms around it, Avhen there was a crash amongst the bushes on the opposite sido of the stream, a gunshot rang through the air, the dog gave one wild leap, shuddered AA7ith one convulsion, and fell at Dolores' feet \u2014 dead. For one instant she stood as if petrified. It had all happened so suddenly, that she was fairly beAA7ildered. But her beAvilder ment did not last long.

She dropped on her knees by the dead animal's side ; she Avas stretching out her hands to it, AA7hen the stranger, dropping his gun, Avith one bound cleared the brook and caught both her hands in a strong firm grasp.

Dolores AA7as on her feet in an instant,"], [31, "A RESCUE. 21 and Avrenched her fingers free of the man's hold. ' Hoav dare you touch me !' she exclaim ed, her eyes flashing and her cheek crim soning. ' What right have you to say my dog Avas mad ? What right have you to kill him?' The man stepped back a feAv paces. But he kept his eye fixed on the girl as if prepared to interpose again Avith physical force, should her self-Avill lead her to dis regard his Avarning. Perhaps it Avas this attitude of his, rather than any belief in his statement, that caused Dolores to re frain from again attempting to touch the dead body of her favourite.

The stranger smiled ' I can assure you,' he replied, ' this dog was undoubtedly suffering from rabies. He appeared this morning at the house Avhere I am staying, bit one dog and escaped before they could shoot him. I have been chasing him all the morning.' Dolores looked down on the body of her pet.

More experienced Avomen than Dolores might have been excused for finding pleasure in the contemplation of such an almost perfect specimen of manly beauty.

But Dolores Avould not hear of this arrangement. As Mr. Ellison had not chosen to Avait for her, he might wander about as long as he pleased looking for her. She Avas going home. The stranger prepared to accompany her as a matter of course, and after one faint protest from Dolores, Avhich he promptly silenced, they set out again.

The young man listened Avith unfeigned interest, smiling once or tAvice as he re called the incidents described to him. ' This really is rather remarkable,' he said, when she had finished.

But the person who was most fasci nated by Mr. Lyndhurst Avas Dolores, and her partiality Avas not difficult to account for.

She had received a detailed account of the AA7alk in search of the Avaterfall, of Mrs. M'Donald's scolding on her return, and of the disagreeable chaff of several members of the party. Dolores had made no secret of her ardent admiration for Mr. Rupert Lyndhurst. She talked of him, indeed, AA7hen alone Avith Honor, incessantly, to the exclusion of all other topics.

And then Dolores had heard nothing more of him. For a Aveek her ankle con fined her to the sofa, and Mr. Ellison, Avhom Mrs. M'Donald had therefore invited to stay on, made himself her slave. She ac cepted his attentions listlessly, and dreamt, poor child, Avaking and sleeping, of the deep blue eyes and caressing voice of Rupert Lyndhurst. Mrs. M'Donald Avrote to Honor, expatiating at great length on Mr. de Lacy Ellison's devotion and on the advantage to Dolores of such a mar riage, but she made no mention of Rupert. As Dolores spoke only of her liking for Rupert, and said nothing to shoAV that she believed her fancy reciprocated, Honor came to the conclusion that it Avas an"], [64, "54 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. unrequited attachment, or at least that the young man had only been amusing himself.

The butler came in AA'ith the letters five minutes after she had sat doAvn. She took them all mechanically off the sahrer, to gether Avith a box. Her eyes brightened and a smile stole over her face as she looked at the hand- writing on the box and the French stamp. She laid one hand on it Avith an uncon- sciously caressing touch, AA7hile she care lessly turned over the other letters. One of them was for Miss Dare. She had not noticed it Avhen she gathered them all off the salver. As she lifted it now to lay it on the table beside her, she noticed that the address Avas in an unmistakable man's hand.

The post mark Avas London, and on the flap of the envelope Avas the badge of the Turf Club. Honor sighed as she finally put the letter doAArn.

Very carefully she unfastened the string, took off the paper and opened the lid of the box, Avhich Avas a light, Avooden one.

She fastened the floAvers in her dress, and clasped her hands over them, and then a sudden shadoAv darkened her face.

Mrs. Stechvorth had not invited Arthur to dinner on the night of their arrival.

But Mr. Ellison's letter troubled him inexpressibly. He would like to have shown it to Honor before meeting the sub ject of it, but that was impossible now. It had only come half-an-hour ago by the second post, and the moment when Mr. Lyndhurst had requested to be received Avas already come. Arthur's lodgings Avere in a dreary street, and his sitting-room was not a par ticularly cheerful apartment.

She kissed the girl, and bade her begin to dress. Very lovingly she superintended the toilette which Susan almost as lovingly waited on. Together the mistress and maid placed the bridal wreath on the beautiful dark head, and arranged the simple tulle veil.

Some times he Avould come in very cross, and angrily check any attempt she made to"], [205, "WHO SHALL SPEAK ? 195 talk to him, or eA'en to ask the most in nocent question as to AA-hat he had been doing. At other times he would be flushed, excited and gay, would kiss her and say that they Avould have a delightful expedi tion next day, or go to the opera in the evening ; and then, poor child, she would be too happy to ask questions. She had, perhaps, unfortunately for herself, been brought up from infancy by unusually good people. Her first protector, Miss Mansfield, had been a singularly SAveet tempered woman, and from her Dolores had never heard a harsh Avord. We knoAv the treatment she received at the hands of all in her guardian's house. It is not strange, therefore, that this young creature, ivho had been wrapped round Avith love and tenderness, and Avho was by nature of an intensely sensitive, clinging disposition, should have shrunk in alarm and dismay o 2"], [206, "196 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. from the irritable and undisciplined tem per of the man she had made her life's companion. Yet she AA7as sIoav to acknoAv ledge that there Avas any fault in him. The fault, she told herself, must lie AA7ith herself, Avho had been spoilt by Honor's in dulgence. It was not until theyAvent to Monte Carlo that she began to have suspicions of her husband's real character. At the time of their marriage, he had asked her if it Avould not be best for him to have the manage ment of her money, and to this she had willingly acceded, as any young and gen erous Avife Avould. He therefore kept her banking-book, and did not call on her to do anything but sign cheques Avhen he had filled them in. Once, Avhen he asked her to sign a cheque, so large as to startle even her inexperience, he explained, Avith great humility, that this Avas money"], [207, "WHO SHALL SPEAK? 197 he was borrowing from her to pay an un expected call on him, caused by the defec tion of a friend, for Avhom he had backed a bill. ' That Avas in my bachelor days,' he said, * I shall never do such a thing again ;' and Dolores was satisfied. But, AA7hen they had been a feAv days at Monte Carlo, the cheques he brought to her to sign became more numerous than ever, AA7hile she herself Avas, for the first time, kept short of money. One night she had lain aAvake for hours thinking of all this and trying to go to sleep, for it annoyed her husband to find her lying aAvake. At last, from sheer Aveariness, she had dropped into a doze, from Avhich she Avas aAvakenedby Rupert's boisterous entrance. ' Hurrah !' he cried, flinging a handful of notes and gold upon the bed. ' I've"], [208, "198 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. broken the bank this time. \u2014 You don't understand AA7hat that means, you dear, innocent, loA'ely little thing !' She did look lovely and innocent as she sat up in bed, her luxuriant masses of hair tumbling about her, her face slightly flushed, and her large eyes shining. He snatched her in his arms and kissed her AArith the fervour Avith Avhich he had been Avont to kiss her in the early days of their engagement. She nestled her beautiful face against his and clung to him. ' Oh, Rupert !' she said, ' I do under stand \u2014 and I don't like it. Oh, let us leave this dreadful place, AA7hich has ruined so many people \u2014 let us leave it to-morrow.' He laughed good-humouredly. ' Honor Avould be shocked, eh ? And Arthur too !

But, needless to say, on the morrow he went back to the gaming-tables, and began steadily to lose the fortune he had Avon. Shortly after this, Dolores received a letter from Honor, containing a A7ery clearly worded warning. It had come to Arthur's ears through Dolores' banker, AA7ho had been an old friend of Mr, Stedworth's, and therefore felt himself entitled to interest himself in his friend's ward, that her bank ing-account Avas very much overdrawn. It had not been till after much anxious thought and consultation betAveen Dolores' tAvo guardians that Honor had Avritten. Her letter caused Dolores considerable dismay. She asked her husband hoAV her banking-account stood. He SAvere a little, then laughed and kissed her, and told her it Avas his business only to see to all that."], [210, "200 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. At this reply she produced Honor's letter, and gave it to him to read. Then he SAVore not a little, but a great deal. 'The meddling fools,' he said. 'Will you tell them it is no business of theirs ?' ' I Avill do no such thing,' cried Dolores, flaring up. ' They are my friends. I love them. They love me ' ' One of them loves you rather too much. Under the circumstances, it Avould be bet ter taste if he Avere to sIioav less interest in your affairs.' The sneer fell harmless. Dolores Avent on : ' I AA7ill not hurt them by resenting their well-meant warnings. And they are right.' ' Oh, of course,' he said, coldly. ' The money is all yours. You do AA7ell to re mind me of that.' She burst into tears, and for the time the discussion ended."], [211, "AVHO SHALL SPEAK ? 201 It Avas not, therefore, Avholly anxiety to see Honor that made her so thankful he had consented to go to Elmdene. She hoped that, out of the Avay of the tempta tion and free from the excitement of a gambler's life, he Avould be loving to her again as he used to be. She Avas absorbed in these reflec- tions Avhen suddenly her husband threAV doAvn, AA7ith an oath, the paper he Avas reading. ' They are laying ten to tAvo against \" Papier Mache,\" ' he exclaimed.

' My dear, I don't care two straAvs Avhat they think of me ; and, if you suppose I am going to spend six months buried at Elmdene, you are mistaken.

If you are fool enough to tell them I am gone to races, that is your look-out, not mine. \u2014 Here Ave are, and there's Honor on the platform.' No need to describe Honor's happiness at having her darling with her again, but she Avas quick to feel that it Avas another Dolores Avho had come back to her. The passionate, impulsive girl had deA'eloped already into a self-contained woman. Not that Dolores AA7as not rapturous as a child in her greeting of Gib, and of all the old familiar objects of her home, but Avhen the"], [213, "AVHO SHALL SPEAK ? 203 conA7ersation turned on her life during her towels abroad, she greAV constrained and cold. ' She is not happy,' said Honor to her self, Avith bitter pain, but she stroA'e to hide this conviction from Arthur, Avho questioned her, Avith feverish eagerness, as to the young Avife's every indication of her frame of mind ; for he, too, noted the sad ness of Dolores' face AA'hen in repose, and the Avistfulness AA7ith AA7hich her eyes fol loAved her husband. ' She is not very strong just noAv, you knoAv,' Honor said, trying to convince herself as Avell as Arthur. ' By-and-by she AA7ill be her old self again.' And at first it seemed as if this hope had been reasonable. When Dolores' baby daughter Avas laid for the first time in her arms, the rapture of the young mother gladdened Honor's heart, and by her"], [214, "204 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. account of it brought solace to Arthur's. Rupert, too, showed himself at his best. The sight of his child roused, for a time, his better nature, his pleasure satisfied his Avife, and his attentions to her satisfied Honor and Arthur. Gib took the deepest interest in the baby. Dolores insisted on Rupert's lifting him on her bed Avhen the infant Avas lying beside her, that she might, she said, intro duce them to each other properly. He sniffed round the little AA7hite bundle, tried to lick its face, but being checked in this attempt, lay doAvn beside it Avith one paAV placed in a protecting attitude over it. The child Avas christened Honor, and Honor and Arthur Avere both godparents. It Avas a merry christening feast, and Dolores AAras gay as she used to be in her early girlhood. Tavo days after this, Rupert went away"], [215, "AVHO SHALL SPEAK ? 205 on business, and then the brightness faded out of the young mother's face, but she maintained a resolute silence to Honor as to the nature of the business that had taken her husband aAvay, and she strove valiantly to laugh and sing and seem as happy as eA'er. It Avas not, hoAvever, possible to deceh'e the loving eyes that Avatched her, and, as time went on, Rupert took less and less pains to conceal his mode of life from his Avife's relations. He Avas often aAvay for ten days at a time, and, AA7hen he Avas at Elmdene, he spent most of his time at the club in Daningham, playing cards and billiards, and soon fell into his continental habits of not returning home till tAvo or three in the morning. ' I think,' said Arthur one day to Honor, when the Lyndhursts had been nearly nine months at Elmdene, and autumn was"], [216, "206 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. rapidly developing into winter, ' I think it is time Ave spoke.' They had been discussing the subject long and sadly, and this AA'as the conclu sion he had come to. ' I quite agree Avith you,' he Avent on, ' that Ave should, for Dolores' sake, keep friends Avith him, but it is equally necessary for her sake that something should be done to check him. He is squandering the Avhole of her income, and reducing her to practical want.' ' But I know she has taken the manage ment of her money into her oavii hands,' said Honor. ' Yes \u2014 to give it all to him. That's no good. He must be spoken to.' ' Yes,' replied she, ' the question is, what are Ave to say, and aaLio shall say it, you or I?'

Tavo or three days after her conversation Avith Arthur, Rupert, aa71io had been in Daningham all day, came to the study Avhere she Avas sit ting Avriting before dinner. ' May I come in?' he asked, and. on per mission being granted, flung himself into a chair.

' It's very good of you to have had us here all this time, and it's been of course a very great thing for Dolores. But it's about time for us to be going. ' Oh, no, not yet,' she ansAvered, quickly. ' You had much better stay here till baby is a little older.' ' Well, the fact is, I must go \u2014 I haA7e business abroad,' he said, someAvhat jaun tily. ' And I don't think Dolores Avould like staying behind Avithout me. She is desperately fond of me, you knoAv,' he added, Avith one of his charming smiles. ' She is, indeed,' returned Honor, gravely.

I should not dream of trying to persuade Dolores to remain here Avithout you, nor do I think it Avould be possible to persuade her. But, Rupert, \u2014 do not be angry Avith me \u2014 there is one thing I want to say to you.

At this moment the door opened, and Arthur, AA7ho had been invited to dinner, came in AA7ith a business letter which he wanted Honor to read. He caught Rupert's last words, hesitated, and Avas about to retire, Avhen the young man saAV him and turning to him, exclaimed, ' Pray come in, Mr. Stanton, and speak for yourself, as I am sure Mrs. StedAvorth has only been your mouthpiece, hitherto.'

Dolores is my Avife, and I am accountable to her only for the manner in AA'hich I spend her money.' ' Pardon me,' said Arthur, unheeding the gentle fingers Avhich Honor laid warn ingly on his arm. ' It is mine and Mrs. Stedworth's business to see that you treat your wife properly.

The Avords that Rupert had uttered Avere ringing in his ears. Some instinct told him they Avere true, though they had fallen AA'ith a shock of terrible surprise. He had never dreamt of such a thing, and Avas overwhelmed Avith bitter remorse.

He stood looking doAvn with an aching heart on the pure, proud face of the Avoman he so reA'erenced and trusted. He could have Avept at the thought of her pain.

' It Avould have been better if Ave had not met,' returned the other, in a hard, defiant tone ; and then she looked doAvn on the grave at their feet. Her face changed, and her voice trembled.
