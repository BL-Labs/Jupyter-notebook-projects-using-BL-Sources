There is something unmistakable in the eyes and mouth, some thing irresistibly reminding them of the tur bulent Nest \u2014 woman grown as she is. The astonishment waxes louder and louder. \" I would not tell you, my dear sister. I wished you to be surprised.

And astonishment giving place to pleasure, they had time to look at each other. Gwenny need not have been dissatisfied with her three grand elder sisters' decision regarding them. They each wondered at the change in the others. When health, exercise, and happiness are permitted to develop the frame we receive from our Maker, how beautiful is youth just changing from childhood into girlhood. The bloom so fresh, the eyes so bright, the expression so good and ingenuous, and over all such buoyant happiness. No won- der Mr. and Mrs. Leslie, and all the little Leslies, gazed at the three elder daughters of the house with unmistakable admi- ration. \" My dear sister, how are we ever to thank you sufficiently for such very great pleasure \u2014 such a delightful surprise ! \" \"I am amply repaid.

You took from us two little sad and stricken children, and you return us three blooming maidens, of whom any parents may be proud. I thank you.\" And he arose, after his grave fashion, and shook hands with each. \" Pearl always promised to be pretty,\" remarked her mother, half-blushing at thus"], [12, "6 THE VALLEY OF praising her own daughter ; \" but Nest astonishes me.\" \"True,\" said her husband, \"she seems not only healthy and strong, but to have grown rather a handsome girl.\" \" Perhaps a little too tall,\" interrupted Emily. \"Not at all,\" exclaimed both Sir Edward and Lady Armitage ; \" and let me add,\" continued he, \" that she is a very excel lent, docile child \u2014 we have had no fault to find with her.\" As the elders thus discoursed, overflowing with their tide of family affairs, the young ones were not a whit behindhand. \" Nessie, if you are Nessie,\" said Gwla dys and Gwenny, \" don't take off your bonnet\" (they were all running up to see the darling Joan, and the new baby), \" but let us surprise Wilsy.\" This was considered a felicitous idea. Adeline and Pearl disrobed, Nest remained"], [13, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 7 bonneted and cloaked, looking a greater woman than ever. Wilsy was in a state of the highest ex pectation, her Roman nose drawn into an acute angle by the breadth of her smiles. Little Joan so beautifully dressed, and taking the hearts of all three sisters by an instan taneous gush of feeling that brought tears into all their eyes \u2014 and they paid no heed to the new baby sister until they had kissed those lovely, loving eyes. But as for Wilsy \u2014 that renowned nursery commandant, that merciless lover of soap and brushing, that arbitrary inflicter of con dign punishment \u2014 Wilsy, whom they always feared, obeyed, and succumbed to, more than papa and mamma, Wilsy sat down in amazement, to think that such beautiful young ladies should have been her nurs lings. \" Oh !

Yer just pictures both on you .\" Wilsy's admiration was mounting up higher and higher, as did the blushes on the two girls' faces ; but there was a stir of impa tience among the young ones. Wilsy was a long time noticing the stranger, who still kissed Joan with such fond affection. \" But here's another young lady,\" began Gwenny \u2014 \" she has come to see Joan.\" Wilsy turned reluctantly from the plea sant sight of Adeline and Pearl, and politely curtseyed, saying : \u2014"], [15, "9 A HUNDRED FIRES. \" I am very proud to show her, ma'am ; and for all she is so small, she's as healthy as healthy can be.

It's past every thing \" and Wilsy took a deliberate walk all round Nest, to make a thorough investigation. The most amusing comedy in the world could not have afforded more delight than this scene to the little Leslies. But Nest, not accustomed to admiration, began to grow uncomfortable. \" I am not so ' mischeevous' as I was, Wilsy,\" she began. \" Now, be done, Miss Nest, and don't remember you of bygones.

Darling little thing, she will!\" It is needless to say that the little Les lies enacted this petite comedy with every new visitor, and enjoyed it all the more from repetition. Gwenny's little private ambition of ex celling her foreign sisters experienced a shock at first. But with the dauntless spirit of her grandmother rising strong within her, she derived consolation from the fact that she and Gwladys knew a number of things her sisters did not. Such as in all kinds of needle-work (which in truth was an art not patronized by Lady Armitage) they were decidedly superior. In the common exercise of good round text handwriting, Nest and Pearl were far behind ; while at various games, \" Tip tap-toe\" \u2014 French and English \u2014 the golden goose, they were profoundly ignorant."], [19, "13 A HUNDRED FIRES. So an agreement was made for an in terchange of accomplishments. Notwithstanding their age; their dignified appearance, with frocks as long as Adeline's, below their ankles, Nest and Pearl ran up and down the Cinder Tip with as much spirit as heretofore, and enacted plays in the coach-house, excelling past days in the most charming manner. But they had not been a week united once more before the quick mother eyes of Mrs. Leslie detected a change in Adeline. Even more gentle and submissive to her aunt than before, untiring in her endea vours to fulfil all her wishes, she appeared to fail in pleasing her in any one point. Exacting and severe with Adeline \u2014 Nest and Pearl did everything that was right in her eyes. At first, Mrs. Leslie feared that the younger sisters, especially Nest, had supplanted the elder one in the affections"], [20, "14 THE VALLEY OF of her sister. But they appeared uncon scious of any such injustice to Adeline, and kept in the background, their usual habit. While Adeline, with a beautiful unselfish ness, always screened her sisters when they committed any act likely to call forth their aunt's displeasure. And there was nothing but the most perfect love and good feeling between them. It was with motherly commands and entreaties that Mrs. Leslie extracted from Adeline the real cause of this untoward state of things. It was love. For some moments our Emily was unable to think of any other thing, so astonished was she to discover she had a daughter old enough not only to be loved, but to love. And yet Adeline was now the same age of Emily herself when she fell in love with and married John. During their sojourn abroad they had seen a great deal of a Mr. Badinell, the"], [21, "15 A HUNDRED FIRES. son of the Bishop of , a young cler gyman. As Adeline discoursed of his man ners, appearance, and amiability, Emily felt herself eighteen once more. She was in love with the very description of so charm ing a young man, and in the enthusiasm of her nature longed to call him a son-in-law at once. \" I suppose he is very poor,\" murmured she, sadly. \" I think not, mamma, he has a very good living, and his father gives him 300/. a-year besides.\" \" Three hundred a-year, my dear child \u2014 that is quite sufficient to marry upon, with out the living.\" \" Dear mother, my aunt does not think so.\" \" He has not made himself agreeable, or pleasant to her.\" \" On the contrary, she likes him so much, that she loved him almost as a son, until, until .\""], [22, "16 THE VALLEY OF \" I understand, love,\" interrupted her mother, rescuing Adeline from her blushing hesitation; \"and, of course, your uncle has a very good opinion of him also.\" \" Very, very much so.

Or, in other words, dear mamma, he has said, he both respects and admires his character.\" \" Young, good-looking, rich, and so amia ble, what possible reason has my dear sister to reject so excellent a young man ? \" \" Because, because, mother \u2014 \u25a0 you must pardon me if I appear vain.\" \" Vain, my darling \u2014 most excellent child \u2014 I am vain, if you wish \u2014 vain of the dearest daughter ! \" Here they kissed each other fondly, a way Emily had, when the English language failed her, in its paucity of powers of ex pression \u2014 though every one does not con sider that its greatest want."], [23, "33 A HUNDRED FIRES. occasion presented itself, indiscriminately.

At the present mo ment \u2014 namely, just as Jeffreys asked his last question of his mother \u2014 the pin was doing duty for the baby, festooning the curtains of her cradle in a graceful knot, which it fastened tight, against the encroachments of her innocent fingers. \" Mother, I must go and see her the first thing in the morning.\" \" So you shall, my dear. It is very right that you go as soon as possible to pay your respects to Mr. and Mrs. Leslie.\" \" Pooh, nonsense !

And in her eyes he looked very well indeed \u2014 arrayed in a blue coat, with handsome brass buttons, a white waist coat, a blue tie, on which reposed the twin pin, and light kerseymere continuations, with patent boots \u2014 just become a boon granted to the fashionable world. No one was in the room but Adeline when he arrived at the parsonage. Her sweet, cor dial manner went straight to his heart, and smote him with an inward pang, as he remembered his apostasy from her charms.

But suddenly there sprang into the room a vision of loveliness. The moment she saw him she drew up her little figure with such dignity ; and then, when she knew who he was, came forward with so pretty a grace, holding out such a dear little white hand. And then her nose \u2014 Jeffreys, like many people, had his one weakness, a passion for noses, thin, delicate, straight \u2014 in short, the exact re verse of his own. Pearl's nose was per fection.

Mr. Leslie not being so tender-hearted as Emily, and really angry with the young man, sharply reproved him, and sent him away. The next day the elder branches had a consultation ; and as Mrs. Leslie was obliged to confess that her daughter Nest would neither see, nor speak to, nor venture into the society of the love-distracted youth, not apparently able even to pronounce his name, these were all considered symptoms of an unmistakable dislike. Consequently, it would be necessary to tear away this devoted attachment, which had reposed so long in the bosom of the faithful Jeffreys.

Sad as Emily's troubles have been, Mrs. Robarts was much more to be pitied.

Disregardful of the bountiful emptying of fortune's favours on his own head, he grasped in envy at those held out to others. The more full his coffers, the more en vious he became lest others should surpass him. And then, hardest trial of all, the idleness of wealth smote him with a worse disease.

Mr. and Mrs. Robarts tried a season in London. Had they lived to these days, they might have succeeded in obtaining a certain place in society, and occupying themselves in fulfilling the duties of it. But money was not the only passport necessary, thirty years ago, to get into London life. Rank, blood, learning, and statesmanship were all more or less requi site, and among these Mr. Robarts had no chance. And his wife, gentle, pretty, and lady-like, was yet so wholly absorbed in her own family, she was incapable of"], [49, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 59 making the least effort merely for society. Thus their experience of London was rather more than disheartening \u2014 it was wholly distasteful.

They did not give up their house in the Valley of the Hundred Fires, as Mr. Robarts had still very large interests vested in the iron works, which now and then required his attention; besides, Mrs. Robarts, whose matrimonial speculations for her daugh ters had never slumbered, always meant to return to Tymawr, when their former em ployers (now equals), the Bernards, came back.

Those whom her good taste led her to select as friends, were not dis posed to keep up more than a visiting acquaintance with one whose ideas never strayed from her own household. And others, upon whom she was at last thrown, had interested motives, sufficiently plain to be seen even by herself. And yet never had she wanted a true friend so much as now.

His irritability towards his children had caused the first serious quarrel between him self and Mrs. Robarts, and it appeared to give him no qualms at all to extend his ill-temper to herself.

Two of the elder girls, as has been noti fied in this history, died. There still remained three, of the ages of nineteen, twenty, and twenty-one \u2014 Jane and Maria, the two eldest, both extremely pretty ; Eliza Mary the third, sadly disfigured by weak eyes and stunted growth.

The reason she reserved these two for but one fortunate individual was their contrast to each other. They could very well have enacted Minna and Brenda, as regarded complexion and hair \u2014 so that, if one failed to please, the other would be certain of admiration. But they were not of the same mind as their mother. They liked a little flirtation very much, and would have been glad to leave their lux urious home, their many pleasures, their fond mother, for any fate, so that they might have change, and rid themselves of a monotonous life.

The anguish and dismay of poor Mrs. Robarts were not mitigated by the harsh taunts of her husband, who, in vindicat ing his own warnings regarding her mode of education, was merciless in his up braidings. In the torment of her feelings she poured them all out in a letter to Mrs. Leslie, feeling unable to contain them within her own heart, yet being equally convinced she had not a friend near her who would truly sympathize with her. It was only when her letter was gone that she re membered how many of Emily's kind, sweet letters, so like herself, had remained un noticed, almost unread.

She fell into her arms with a gush of grateful, happy tears, and acknowledged to herself, then and evermore, that wealth never brought her so great a boon as the simple, spontaneous feeling that prompted Emily to come so speedily to comfort her. And what a halo of good she brought with her ! How impossible was it to resist the contagion of her bright, hopeful spirit ! How she swept down impossibilities, overcame obstacles, ignored difficulties, and could and would see no grievances ! How Mr. Robarts stormed, argued, and railed against his daughter, vowing he would cast her off, give her no fortune, refuse to see her \u2014 and how, without knowing in what manner it was effected, he found himself promising Emily to forgive her.

And how this pretty Jane, heretofore silly, and wholly given to vanities, awak ened up to a sense of very different things, and was heard promising her young spouse to be as good as Mrs. Leslie some day ; and beseeching her young sisters never to follow her example, as it could only happen once in a life-time that so wrong a step should be so gently treated."], [57, "67 A HUNDRED FIRES.

She took her self to account every moment for having thrown such temptation in the way of her sons before they had seen Pearl. \" You appear troubled, my wife,\" said Lord Bernard, suddenly alighting upon her, in the midst of all the bustle and prepa ration. \" Did you ever expect to see any of the Robartses surpass the Leslie girls, Henry?'''"], [81, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 91 \" Upon my word, I was foolish enough to do so, Kate, considering the pains and anxieties they have cost their mother, and the little trouble that has been taken with the others.\" \" But in reality you do not think so ? \" \" Pardon me \u2014 you speak, of course, re garding the outside.

And while Lady Bernard gazed so fondly upon her, Nest was exciting admiration on her side. Jeffreys had just responded to Bessie's whispered exclamation, \" She is more beautiful than ever ! \" when Nest espied them.

As that lady looked at the three girls, dressed very simply in white crape, their mag nificent hair rolled into many shining bows, as was then the fashion, and fas tened with pearl combs, she felt quite a thrill of pleasure that the Valley of a Hundred Fires should produce such beauti ful specimens of girlhood ; and she has tened to introduce them, with a sort of proud vanity, to her noble guests, saying, \" Our rector's daughters ! \" They were all three very different ; and H 2"], [90, "100 THE VALLEY OF if they had each their own peculiar style, still in all was to be seen that simple, artless expression which threw a . charm over all they did or said.

One of the happiest groups in the ball room were the Dawsons. Jeffrey's hair was on end with delight. Everybody he asked, and his own family in particular, whom he repeatedly called upon to reiterate the fact, declared they had never seen so fine a girl as Nest; and in spite of her being so admired, and getting so many partners, she was always running up to exchange a word with Bessie Trumps, laugh with the doctor, coax Mrs. Dawson, and be wholly and entirely a delicious darling. \"But, Dolly,\" whispered the Doctor,"], [95, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 105 \" there isn't such a neat little figure in the rooms as our Bessie Trumps ! \" \" Or so light a dancer,\" responded his wife. \" And where she learnt it is the wonder.\" \" ' A light heart makes light heels,' doctor ; look at her now regarding Jeffreys \u2014 such a pretty, wife-like look.\" The Sabines were amazingly happy. \" I have experienced many different scenes of life, but I do not know if I ever un derwent the sensation of dancing.

But she was considerably com forted by hearing very happy laughter on the Cinder Tip, and perceiving her great, supposed love-sick Nessie was the perpe trator of this laugh.

It was not until dressing-time that the young delinquent made her appearance in her mother's presence, knocking at the door with a knock most guilty in its tremu lousness. Emily's cheerful \"come in!\" disclosed a figure quite consonant with the knock. Blushing crimson and paling white with extreme rapidity, Nessie stood with down cast eyes before her mother. \"Well, my darling,\" said that good mo ther, becoming quite as flushed, but resolved upon doing the deed to be done with un flinching spirit, \" have you had a pleasant walk?\" This was to put Nessie at ease ; but, on"], [123, "133 A HUNDRED FIRES. the contrary, it had quite the opposite effect.

A moderate dose of anything good or pleasant she could bear with standing composure ; but the amount of gratified vanity and maternal pride, to gether with an entire freedom from fear regarding her daughter's happiness, over whelmed her for the moment. Then came the shock, the dread lest, in precipitancy of joy, Nessie might herself be blinded. \" But you love him, my child ? \" \" Yes, mamma.\" Low as the words were spoken, still more expressive was the one sudden up lifting of the drooping eyelids.

In any sudden emotion, any great event, Emily had to speak to God, out of the fulness of her heart, ere she could enter into any other business.

No answer was required, for a well known voice was heard, unwonted in that region of the house, but still not the less unmistakable because of the creaking shoes. Papa stood there, a mixture of pleasure and perplexity in his face. \"Is my daughter Nest there?\" he asks, putting on his spectacles. \"Yes, papa.\" \"There is a young man below who wishes to take her from me.\""], [129, "139 A HUNDRED FIRES.

Then the eyes grew dim, the ears closed upon earthly sounds, and ere the last child had been removed from the bed the spirit was gone. It appeared, notwithstanding that the poor dead mother had in some measure lost her life through over-care and anxiety for those imme diately belonging to her, none mourned her so sincerely as one who had little reason to do so, Mrs. Leslie.

Also Pearl was deposed from her pedes tal in the favour of Aunt Armitage, and Adeline reinstated up a dozen steps higher. Therefore it may be supposed that Adeline was in a peculiar state.

The two Miss Leslies, now of an age to be con sidered in the matrimonial market, were not at all the sort of young ladies that he had expected to see.

Alas, for poor Gwenny! \u2014 but, oh, triumph for her papa ! \u2014 Captain Daintree succumbed at once to the charms of Elizabeth. Now, it would take a whole volume to relate the different states of love, jealousy, and despair into which Gwenny fell, and all without outward show ; and how at last they all gave way and shrunk into ghosts, shadowy and painless, before the tearful grief of Lizzy, who acknowledged that she loved this too attractive man ; and how he would love her, too, and be very glad to marry her, only he was engaged to Gwenny.

Lodge's Peerage and Baronetage is acknowledged to be the most complete, as well as the most elegant, work of the kind. As an established and authentic authority on all questions respecting the family histories, honours, and connections of the titled aristocracy, no work has ever stood so high. It is published under the especial patronage of Her Majesty, and His Royal Highness the Prince Consort, and is annually corrected throughout, from the personal communications of the Nobility. It is the only work of its class, in which, the type being kept constantly standing, every correction is made in its proper place to the date of publication, an advantage which gives it snpremacy over all its competitors. Independently of its full and authentic information respecting the existing Peers and Baronets of the realm, the most sedulous attention is given in its pages to tbe collateral branches of the various noble families, and the names of many thousand individnals are introduced, which do not appear in other records of the titled classes. For its authority, correctness, and facility of arrangement, and the beauty of its typography and binding, the work is justly en titled to the high place it occupies on the tables of Her Majesty and the Nobility. \" Lodge's Peerage must supersede all other works ofthe kind, for two reasons ; first, it Is on a better plan ; and, secondly, it is better executed.
