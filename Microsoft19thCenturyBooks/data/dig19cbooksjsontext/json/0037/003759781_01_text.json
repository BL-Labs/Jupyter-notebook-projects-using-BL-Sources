The historical knowledge of the State which the author acquired in the preparation of \" The Young People's History of Maine,\" led to an increased acquaintance with its people and localities ; and the popularity of that work has led to the belief that a Gazetteer of the State, in which every town, plantation, mountain, lake and bay- should receive due mention would be welcomed by the intelligent people of Maine. Accordingly, the attempt has been made to present in these pages a clear and concise topographical description, together with a brief historical and statistical notice of the several counties, cities, towns and villages of the State. Three works of a somewhat similar nature had previously been offered to the public ; but the two older ones are rarely to be found and arc quite out of date, and therefore wide from present facts, while a recent work is on a plan not suited to the popular demand. It is hoped that the present compilenient may meet the requirements of a great number of people ; yet the author is con scious that the book is not perfect, neither is it so full as it might be made would space allow. To those desiring more of a business and political directory the author wo'uld recommend \" The Manue Register,\" the excellent year book of Hoyt, Fogg & Donham. The author takes this opportunity to express his thanks for the full specifications furnished by clerks of cities, towns and plantations by filling our blank circulars and by letters. One city and a few towns have failed to respond, wherefore the articles relating to those places are not so full as they otherwise would be. Coolidge & Mansfield's History and Description of New England has afforded much aid; and many important and pleasing facts have been obtained from the articles in Crocker & Howard's History of New England, prepared by Revs. Mark Trafton, D.D., J. S. Cogswell, E. P. Thwing, J. S. Swift, Henry O. Thayer, Amasa Loring, Geo. B. Ilsley, and Hon. Parker Tuck and Miss C. B. Homer, with William B. Lapham, M.D., and R. R. McLeod, L. F. Starrett, R. K. Sewall, E. F. Duren, E. P. Mayo, Albert C. Wiggin, and Geo. W. Drisko, Esqs. Essential aid has been obtained from E. H. Elwell's \" Portland"], [14, "6 PREFACE. and Vicinity,\" and his pleasing and useful pamphlet on Aroostook. Acknowledgments are due to the heads of departments in the State government for documents ; and for maps, atlases, sketches of town and county history to Joseph Williamson, Esq., of Belfast ; Rev. H.

It is hoped that articles in the first part of the volume relating to the State in general will also be found useful. Boston, July 1, 1881."], [15, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. THE STATE OF MAINE. NAME, BOUNDARIES AND AREA. In the time of the earliest explorers of America the whole Atlantic coast was spoken of under the term Norumbega. Its application soon began to narrow, and its southern boundary became that of southern New England ; the next bound took it to the Penobscot, \" the River of Norumbega,\" up which it soon retreated to an imaginary semi-civil ized city. The city melted into a myth, and the name has finally found its local habitation at \" Norumbega Hall,\" in Bangor. As soon as the region of Maine began to be noticed by writers, it was spoken of as Mavosheen. Our State first received its present name in 1639, when Sir Ferdinando Gorges obtained from King Charles I. the charter of the \" Province of Mayne.\" Governor Sullivan of Massachusetts, in his history of Maine, says that Gorges adopted that name in compliment to the queen, who was a daughter of the King of France, and held a right in the French Province of Maine. The fishermen of New Eng land, at the time, no doubt thought the name was an adoption of their own term of \" main,\" used to distinguish a coast from the neighboring islands. Its vast product of the noble pine-tree has caused it to be characterized as the \" Pine-tree 8tate.\" The boundaries of the Province of Maine were the Piscataqua River to its source, thence northward one hundred and twenty miles \u2014 which brings the northern boundary near the latitude of Dead River \u2014 and on the east, the Sagadahoc or Kennebec River. From this grant Maine obtained its south-western and western boundaries, but it took many surveys to settle it; and Massachusetts and New Hamp shire did not agree upon it until 1789. The southerly boundary begins at a point in a line S.S.E. from \" the entrance into Piscataqua harbor,\" and 60 miles distant, and thence extends north-eastwardly, enclosing all the islands within twenty leagues of the main land, to Passamaquoddy Bay. On the east and north, the boundaries of the State are derived in general from the cession of Acadia and Canada by France to England in the treaty which closed the con quest of Canada in 1760. The treaty of 1783, by which Great Britain acknowledged the independence of the United Colonies, de-"], [16, "8 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. scribed this boundary to be \" from the north-west angle of Nova Scotia, viz., that angle which is formed by a line drawn due north from the source of St. Croix River to the highlands ; along the said high- lands, which divide those rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence, from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean, to the north-westernmost head of Connecticut River. This line in its course intercepts near its termination the western line of the Province of Maine, and thus the circuit of the State is completed. As with the western line, it required many surveys, arbitration by the Netherlands, and almost a war to settle it. The British claimed that the true St. Croix was what our government regarded as a western branch of the river; and they also claimed that the line of highlands intended in the treaty were those dividing the waters of the St. John's as well as those of the St. Lawrence from the rivers of Maine. This would take off quite a broad strip on the east and a piece on the north that embraced about one-third of our territory. It was the dispute in regard to these that caused our bloodless \" Aroostook War.\" The lines were settled as they now stand in 1842. By this settlement, the boundary between the ter- ritory of Maine and the British possessions began in the channel between the mainland and Campo Bello Island, and passing between Eastport and Deer Island, dividing Neutral or St. Croix Island oppo- site Robbinston, and continuing up the river to its uppermost head, thence due north until it strikes the St. John's River, then following the middle of this river to the St. Francis, and through the middle of that river to the source of its south-west branch at Lake Pohenaga- mook in latitude 47\u00b0 31' 39\" and longitude 69\u00b0 37' 21\" ; and from this point, instead of following the highlands which divide the waters fall- ing into the St. Lawrence from those emptying into the Atlantic Ocean, it went in a straight line south-westerly, to a small tributary of the St. John's, thence southerly to the St. John's River again, and up the stream to the monument near the head of the stream. From this point it followed the highlands that divide the St. Lawrence waters from those that run easterly and southerly to the line between New 'Hamp- shire and Maine. For this surrender of territory the United States re- ceived from Great Britain territory of greater value on the borders of Lakes Charnplain and Superior ; and Maine received from the national government one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The greatest witdh of the state from Quoddy Head due west to New Hampshire is 200 miles ; and its greatest \"length is from Kittery Point to the north- eastern angle, a distance of 350 miles. The length of the shore line in a nearly direct course is about 226 miles ; but following the sinuos ities of the shore, it is variously estimated from 2000 to 3000 miles. The area of Maine is 31,776 square miles (or 20,320,240 acres), which is only 1200 square miles less than all the rest of New England com bined. _ The greatest length is 320 miles ; and the maximum width 160 miles. Of this territory about one-half is unimproved. In the report of the land agent for 1878 occurs the following state ment : \u2014 \" With reference to the matter of settlement in our wilderness domain, it may be proper to note the fact, for general information, that all the public lands of Maine having been disposed of, no further favors are within the power of the State to grant for homesteads to settlers * * * * But still, there remain large tracts of land in Aroos took and other counties belonging to private owners or proprietors, of"], [17, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 9 the same general productive character as those already spoken of, which the owners are ready to sell for homes and farms, and, too, at prices which give purchasers advantages over other and less favorable localities.\" BAYS, HARBORS, CAPES AND ISLANDS. The coast of Maine forms the northern shore of the Gulf of Maine, that broad angle of the sea enclosed between Cape Cod and Cape Sable. It tends north-easterly and south-westerly, thus conforming to the geneial direction of the rock strata throughout the State. At^the middle oHts coast line is Penobscot Bay, whence the tide flows up the river to Bangor, thus affording passage to the largest coast vessels almost to the centre of the State. Passamaquoddy is another noble bay, which will find a more extensive use in the future. Casco Bav is the next in size, and is well protected from ocean swelis by numerous islands. Portland harbor, on this bay, is of great excellence, having a depth of water sufficient to float the largest ships, while it remains open throughout the year. The harbors of Eastport, Machias, Boothbay, Rockland and Belfast all afford safe havens through the year; while the river ports of Calais, Bangor, Bucksport, Wiscasset (Sheepscot Bav) and Bath, afford good anchorage, and free access in all seasons in most years. The other large bays, likely to be more used in the future are Frenchman's, Englishman's, Narraguagus, Pleasant River, Taunton, Union River, Muscongus and Quohog. Other notable bays and harbors of our coast are Portsmouth Harbor, Saco and Muscongus bays, St. George's, Castine and South-West harbors. The considerable projections of land are Kittery Point, Fletcher's Neck, Libby's Neck, Cape Elizabeth, the Harpswell, Ph'.ppsburg, St. Geonre and Brooklin peninsulas, CnpeNewagen, Pemaquid, Gouklsboro and Machias (\"Point of Maine\") and Quoddy Head. The notable islands are Mount Desert, and at Penobscot Bay, Isle au Haute, Deer Isle and the Fox Islands ; Monhegan and St. George's; at the Kennebec are Georgetown and Arrowsie and Swan's island ; and near Casco Bay, Orr's and Great Island, Chebeague, Richmond, and others. It might at first be supposed that our jngged coast would be the scene of more shipwrecks than any other equal length of shore. On the New Jersey coast, however, there were, in 1879, 48 disasters to vessels against 40 on the Maine coast \u2014 which is one-third longer. Again only 7 of the disasters on our coast proved total losses, to 16 on the New Jersey coast. The latter has forty life saving stations to our six ; \u2014 while in these 40 disasters on our coast only two lives were lost. Thus, notwithstanding its threatening rocks, our shores do not prove so dangerous to mariners as might be expected. The coast is well adapted for defence ; and the remarkable tidal flow in the rocky basin of a coast line 3000 miles in length, can be operated with advantage as a power for 16 hours a day. While the mean tide of New York is 4-8 feet, that of Maine's coast is 11*6 feet; at Eastport it is 18-1 feet."], [18, "10 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. MOUNTAINS. The most characteristic feature of Maine is its hilliness. The Hydrographic Survey of the State gives 600 feet as the average eleva- tion above the sea of its whole territory. The coast has only three considerable elevations. \u2014 Agamenticus, in York, 672 feet, Megunticook, in Camden, 1,457, and Gi'een Mountain, in Mount Desert, 1,533 feet above the level of the sea. The \" highlands \" along the north-western side of Maine, are bare, barren, and of the uniform height of about 2,000 feet above the surface of the sea, which circumstances give tho range suitability as a boundary line. But between these and the coast region is an elevated triangular tract reaching from Fryeburg on the south to the Bald Mountain Ridge (at the Canadian border and in the latitude of the northern extremity of Moosehead Lake) and extending from south-west to north-east across the State, decreasing to a point at Mars Hill on the eastern border. The general elevation of the water levels in the region of Moosehead Lake is above 1,100 feet above sea level, falling off somewhat in all directions, but most toward the east. In the whole extent of this tract start up here and there isolated peaks or short ranges. As disposed in its different parts with respect to sea level, the surface of the State shows, firstly, an ascending slope from the shore line 140 miles into the interior ; secondly, a counter slope or declivity extending 78 miles in the widest part to the northern bound- ary ; thirdly, a general falling off in height from west to east. The divide separating the first two slopes has a height above sea-level varying from 1,800 feet in the west, to 600 in the east, affording an average of 1,085 feet, according to our report of the North-Eastern Boundary Survey. The area of the Northern Slope is 7,400, and of the Southern, 24,100 square miles. The former has a comparative uniformity of elevation over its different parts ; the descent from the water-shed ridge on the south to the St. John on the north, is not sufficient tosjive more than a slow movement to the streams, and the depression of the whole basin to the eastward is so slight that the currents of the St. John itself is moderate. This slope is swampy and devoid of falls as compared with the Southern Slope ; the latter having a decided and uniform descent sea-ward over its w'lole extent. Our highest moun tain is Katahdin, whose top is 5,385 feet above the sea. This region of elevation is considered by geologists to be a prolongation of the great Appalachian, or Alleghany chain of mountains, which rises in northern Georgia, and bends north-easterly along the continent, manifesting its existence in New York in the Catskills and the Adirondacks, losing in elevation by diffusion, until in New Hampshire, the peaks again rise into grandeur as the White Mountains. The mountains of Maine differ from the Appalachian chain in their middle and southern region, in that they consist not of ridges, but peaks more or less conical in form, generally isolated, but sometimes disposed in clusters. They arc comparatively bare of dirt about their summits, being outcroppings of bald rock, and not immense swells of land ; but about their bases they are heavily wooded. Their conical form and dispersement result in a smaller deposit of moisture upon their windward slopes than would occur with continuous ridges; and in consequence there is a more equal rainfall in all parts. (See article \" Mountains \" in alphabetical part of this book.)"], [19, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 11 VALLEYS. Whatever depression, more or less extended, serves to accumulate the surplus water of adjacent districts into a single drainage channel may properly be designated a valley. In Maine, these partake of the plain rather than of the ravine character. They consist mainly of broad tracts of country depressed along their central axk, and separated one from another by wide, low swells instead of steep slopes and abrupt mountain chains or ridges. Their surface, too, is broken and diversi fied with local elevations and depressions, disguising somewhat their character, and rendering the scenery more various and pleasing. The crest of the divides of these valleys are in many localities so low as barely to determine the flow of the waters in one direction rather than another ; and this is especially the case in the vicinity of the ridge dividing the great northern and southern slopes. The waters of the south-west branch of the St. John and those of the Penobscot are drawn in part from the same swamps ; the Kennebec and Penobscot are separated at some points by only a mile or two of very low coun try. The headwaters of the Penobscot in freshets actually become commingled with those of the Allaguash, Aroostook and St. Croix ; and the geographical marvel is many times repeated within our limits of rivers interlocking at their sources and flowing off in different directions upon different slopes. The valleys of the northern part of the State are determined in their line of length by the trend of the Appalachian ridges ; while in the southern part their axes are generally at a very large angle, in many cases amounting to a right angle. Instead of being caused by upheaval, they seem rather to be channels worn by the waters and icebergs of the drift period, though in some cases formed apparently by a \"fault\" in the underlying rock. Another feature resulting from the southward currents of the drift period is the numerous \" horsebacks \" of large or small dimensions found through out the south-eastern slope of the State, \u2014 but largest and most character istic in form in the northern part of the slope. These are masses of sand, gravel, pebbles and sometimes bowlders of the size of a two-quart dish, formed, probably, from glacial moraines in the drift period, or by strong currents, or deposited under an eddy. Our most extended plains are usually tracts of sandy loam, originally covered with a growth of pine. RIVERS. Upon the official map of Maine may be counted 5151 streams. These ramify into innumerable branches, threading the surface of the state with a fine network of brooks and rivulets, so that all parts of it seem alive and in motion with running waters. Of this large number of streams, only seven connect the interior water-sheds with the sea ; while the secondary or seaboard system has nineteen streams ranging from a dozen miles to upwards of fifty in length. Of the principal rivers, the Piscataqua, Kennebec, Sheepscot, Penobscot and St. Croix admit vessels of two thousand tons for a few- miles ; while the Kenne bec is navigable for coast vessels to Augusta, and the Penobscot to Bangor. \" The 1,229,200,000 cubic feet, more or less, of water annually de-"], [20, "12 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. livered by our rivers, fall therefore on their passage to the sea through the mean distance of 600 feet, and in their descent yield a gross power of 4429 horse for each foot of fall. This being multiplied by the total average fall in feet, gives 2,656,200 horse-power gross, which are equivalent to the working energy of over 34,000,000 men laboring without intermission from year's end to year's end.\" * Of course a very considerable fraction of this force exists where circumstances ren- der it of no account as a source of practical power and value ; much of it being consumed in overcoming the friction and resistance of the passage of the waters, while much of it enters the ocean in the form of the velocity of rivers. \"As to the actual amount that can be brought into use for the usual working hours of the year, with an expenditure that would be deemed reasonable at now existing prices of mechanical power, it is a sufficiently close approximation to assign a figure between one and two millions of horse-powers. \" t (See Manufactures; also rivers, under their respective names.) The uniformity of volume in our principal rivers is such that by using available means of storage by dams at the larger reservoirs, nearly the full power can be maintained during working hours through the year, except for a few weeks in exceptionally dry seasons. A grand circumstance in relation to the rivers of our southern slope especially, is that the lines of stratification of our rocks are generally at almost right angles to the courses of the rivers, thus producing the pitches and sudden descents so important to the availability of the power ; while the hardness of the rocks preserves the condition of the channels, and prevents loss of water by absorption and percolation. LAKES AND PONDS. On looking at the map of Maine, one of the first observations will be the numerous lakes and ponds that are divided quite evenly amono the counties. The total count of those represented upon our maps as connected with our rivers within the State is not less than 1568. This number does not include the multitude of small ponds scattered about in such profusion that almost every school district has one; nor those large and small, in the wilderness districts, that are not rep resented upon any ma]). The lakes of which we have taken account possess at the lowest esti mate a combined area of 2200 square miles. Calculating on the basis ot the above figures, we have one lake to each twenty square miles of territory, and one square mile of lake to each 14.3 square miles of ter ritorial area. Thus Maine contains more lake surface than a million square miles situated in the central and western districts of the United States, south of the lake belt. Almost every one of these ponds is connected with a river by which a constant change of the contents of the basis is kept up, enhancing its purity and supplying industrial motive in its vicinity. It is also a remarkable feature that the lakes of Maine, to an important extent are situated upon the mountain region of the State, and are obliged to seek a passage for their waters over its broken surface, or through its rag. * Hydrograpliic Survey of Maine, p. 8. f Ibi(j _ \u00bb"], [21, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 13 ged ravines ; by which circumstance it is rendered possible to use the waters over and over again at the various falls between the source and the sea. This great number of ponds and lakes so generally diffused add greatly to the beauty of our scenery, while the purity of the water \u2014 often supplied by springs as well as surface streams \u2014 contributes vastlv to both physical and moral health. (See principal lakes and pond\u00bb; under their respective names.) CLIMATE. The State of Maine lies between 43\u00b0 6' and 47\u00b0 27' 33\" N\". latitude and between 66\u00b0 56' 48\" and 71\u00b0 6' 41\" W. longitude. The 45th parallel of latitude crosses the State within thirty miles of its geographical centre. Its position is thus almost equidistant betwixt the equator and the pole, from which results a moderate temperature and variable winds. They prevail successively for a longer or shorter time from every quarter of the compass, bringing therefrom every variety of heat and cold, and of moisture and dryness. The current rarely prevails from one point of the compass for more than three days successively ; and therefore, while the changes are cften quite sudden, neither hot nor cold, wet nor dry, weather prevails for many days in succession in ordinary seasons. It results also that the rains are usually gentle, occupying not unfrequently several days for the deposition of a single inch of water. The sea-fogs of the dog-days, if they do not moisten the soil, impart a grateful coolness to the atmosphere. The mean annual temperature of the northern third of the State from the observations of seventeen years is 38\u00b0. 55 ; the mean of the southern two-thirds from observations in every section of from six to sixty-six years, is 43\u00b0. 21 ; the mean for the whole State being 40\u00b0.88-.. This temperature for a region situated on the 45th parallel is relatively low. The mean summer temperature for the northern third of the- State is 62.\u00b019; for the southern two-thirds, it is 62\u00b0. 18 ; and for State average, 62\u00b0. 185. In comparing Maine with the interior districts of the continent in substantially the same latitude it appears that its summer temperature is lower by over twenty per cent, of their temperature, reckoning from the freezing point of water. The mean winter temperature of the northern third of Maine is 14\u00b0.01 ; of the southern two-thirds, 22\u00b0.90 ;. the mean for the whole State, 18\u00b0.45. The mean winter temperature of districts west of Maine in the same latitude by observation at many points ranging from Burlington, Vermont, to Fort Ripley, Minnesota, is 18\u00b0. 53. The winter in Maine, therefore, is not so severe as in the corresponding latitudes in the interior. The mean summer rainfall in the State is placed in the Hydro graphic Survey at 1113 inches; while the fall at thirty stations in the whole extent of the United States outside of Maine is 10-60 inches. The winter (three months) fall of moisture in the State, including rain, snow and sleet, is placed at 10-13 inches, reduced to liquid. The mean annual depth of snow in Maine is 83.02 inches. This amount of new fallen snow corresponds to 6.91 inches of water. The total downfall for the four months and a half which cover the usual actual limit of"], [22, "14 GAZETTEER OF MAINE snowfall is about 15.62 inches ; so that about 44 per cent, of the total downfall during the four and a half months of actual winter in Maine, is snow. The total annual mean depth of snow observed at Dover, N. H., Montreal, Can., Worcester, Mass., Amherst, Mass., Hartford, Conn., Lambertville, N. J., Cincinnati, O., and Beloit, Wis., is 44-63 inches, which is a little more than one-half of the fall in Maine. There is a considerable difference in the precipitation of moisture between the northern and southern slopes, \u2014 the mean annual fall on the former being 36'71 inches and on the latter, 43-56 inches. There is, however, no lack of moisture for the sustenance of vegetation on the northern slope ; the soil being less open than on the southern. By a record of eleven years kept at the Agricultural College in Oldtown, near the centre of the State, we have the following averages. The hours of observation for temperature and barometer are the same as those formerly adopted by the Smithsonian Institution, viz. : 7 A. M., and 2 P. M., and 9 P. M. The warmest day of the year 1879 was July 16th, when the mean temperature was 77\u00b0. 8, and the coldest day was December 21st, when the mean temperature was 11\u00b0.7 below zero. The highest temperature (88J.0) recorded during the year was on the 2d of August, and the lewest temperature (26\u00b0.0 below zero) on the 27th of December. The range of temperature between the two extremes is 114\".0, or 1\u00b0.2 less than the average range between the extremes for the last eleven years. The warmest day within the period covered by the tables was August 7th, 1876, when the mean temperature was 85\" .3, and the coldest day, January 8th, 1878, when the mean temperature was 17\u00b0.2 below zero. The highest temperature (96<\\7) occurred on August 6tb, 1876, and the lowest temperature (35\u00b0.6 below zero) on January 8th, 1878.

Diseases of the respiratory organs \u2014 always the forms of unhealth prevailing in countries at once moist and cool \u2014 contribute more than any other to the annual mortality of our State ; but even in this our rate is only about the average when considered with England, Wales, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. But the interior, and especially the northern portion of Maine, is to an unusual degree exempt from the ravages of these diseases ; while new comers, soldiers, settlers and others, already affected, derive immediate and marked benefit from the climate. VEGETATION. Under this head the noblest forms properly attract our attention first. Almost the first mention of Maine by explorers was Pring's de- scription of it as \"a high country, full of great woods \" that came down to the water's edge. It is estimated that there are now in farms and wild lands about 20,000 square miles of forest surface. The pri- meval woods of Maine therefore cover a territory seven times larger than the famous \"Black Forest\" of Germany. \"The States of Rhode Island, Connecticut and Delaware,\" says Walter Wells, \"could be lost together in our northern forests, and still have about each a margin of wilderness sufficiently wide to make its exploration without a compass a work of desperate adventure.\" Of the trees that form these forests, the first and noblest is the white pine. It has been seen six feet in diameter at the base, and two hun- dred and forty feet in height; and those of four feet through are fre- quently found. Until the Revolution, every tree, two feet in diameter at the butt, growing in any part of the State except within the limits of Gorges' Provincial Charter, was the property of the English crown, re- served for masts and spars for the royal navy [Williamson's History of Maine, vol. I. p. 110.] This tree was the lord of the forest, and very properly found its place upon our State seal. Another species is the yellow pine, harder and thicker grained than the white, and has, therefore, been used for flooring and for planking vessels. Norway Pine is another variety of still closer texture, of rougher bark, lower"], [24, "16 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. stature, but of more embowering foliage. A variety called the Pitch Pine is sometimes found. It is extremely full of turpentine, and, when dry, makes exceedingly hot fires. The Pines, with the Hemlock, Elm, Maple, Beech, and Button-wood, are our large tres ; the next in size are the Oak, Birch, Basswood, and Ash ; the third class embraces the Larch, Cedar, Fir, Spruce, Poplar, Black Cherry, and perhaps a few others. Our oldest trees are the Oak and the Pine. By their annual rings it has been ascertained that some of them have been growing from five hundred to one thousand years. We have been too wasteful of our forest treasures, the accumulation of more than the age of any empire now existing. The forests are still falling with great rapidity, the amount of lumber prepared for market each year being very great. The principal native shrubs of Maine are the Prickly Ash, Mountain Ash, Black Alder, Barberry, Bayberry, or Wax Myrtle, Boxwood, the Brambles, viz: \u2014 the Raspberry, Blackberry, Brambleberry and Pigeon berry ; the Currant, Gooseberry ; the Brambles and the last two pro ducing eatable fruit ; Dogwood, Cranberry, Whortleberry, Blueberry, and Bilberry ; the Hardback, Hazle, Ground Hemlock (commonly called the ' low Juniper \"), Lambkill (called also Mountain Laurel, Ivy, Calico Bush\"), Moosebush (called also Moosewood), Osier, the Plum, the Choke-Cherry, the Wild-rose (called also the Sweet-briar), Sumach, both the poison and the common, Sweet-fern, Thorn-bush, and others. Of Plants, we have Agrimony, American Rose-bay, Adders'-tongue, Bear-berry, or Bear's tongue, Bitter-sweet, Brake, Bane-berry, Blood root, Buckbean, or Marsh Trefoil, Butterfly-weed, or Pleurisy-root, Cel andine, Comfrey, Cat-mint (or Catnip), China-aster, Columbine, Cowslip, Cuckold, Chequer-berry, or Box-berry, Partridge-berry, Chocolate plant, Colt's-foot, or Wild Ginger (Canada Snake-root), Dandelion, Dogsbane, Dragon-root (Indian Turnip or Wakerobin), Elecampane, or Starwort, Evergreen, Fire-weed, Fever-root, or Wild Ipecac, the Flags, Sweet, Cat-tail and Blue, Ginseng, Golden-rod, Golden-thread and many others. An esteemed writer on agriculture (Samuel Wasson, Esq., of East Surry, Maine), states in the State Agricultural Report for 1878, that Maine has one hundred and twenty-five known species of grass. In New Hampshire ninety species are known, and in Massachusetts, one hundred and thirty. Mr. Wasson thinks that there is not a doubt that a proper survey of the State would discover seventy-five species now unknown here. Of the one hundred and twenty-five known, not more than thirty have been tamed and found friendly, and not over fifty are known to be of any agricultural value. Mr. Wasson says, \"When the Puritans left England in 1620, clover as a cultivated grass was un known there, and not till after a century did the English\" farmers sow the seed, and then only the chaff from their barn floors. Yellow clover was introduced in 1659. Perennial rye-grass was first grown in 1677. This rye, or \" ray \" grass, as it was called, was the first species of peren nial grass ever sown artificially in England. It is now the leading grass in France. In 1700 white clover was introduced. At the close of the American Revolution timothy was carried to England by the returning English soldiers. Orchard grass was carried to the northern country from Virginia in 1764. The sowing of grass seed was not practised in Scotland until 1792. In the early settlement of the North Atlantic States, the colonists foraged their cattle upon the wild indi<*."], [25, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 17 enous grasses, such as white clover, red-top, wiregrass, Indian grass, secretary grass, and foul meadow. Foul meadow was found growing in abundance around Massachusetts Bay, as early as 1629. It grew wild at Madawaska before that place was settled by the Acadian French. Timothy, the herd's-grass of New England, is said to have received its name from Timothy Hanson, of Maryland, who brought it from North Carolina in 1770. According to some, it was first discovered in a swamp by one Hurd, of New Hampshire. In England it received the name of Phleum pratense, or \" Meadow cat's tail.\" Where it origi nated is unknown, as it is nowhere found in a positively indigenous state. When red clover was introduced is not known. It was culti vated in Pennsylvania as early as 1770. Blue-grass (Poa pratensis) is] no doubt a foreigner, although it is said to have been found here in the days of the Indians.\" The line that marks the limit where Indian corn ripens is very irreg ular \u2014 not conforming to the latitude, being isothermal, and varying considerably with the peculiarity of the season. The northern limit for its ripening will correspond very nearly to a line drawn from Lake Umbagog across the State to Mars Hill \u2014 which marks the higher part of the elevated belt on the south. Yet in some sections in Aroostook corn is found a reliable crop. Wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat and the roots yield a fair crop all over the State so far as climatic influences go, but in general are most thrifty in the rich soils of Aroostook. Apples, pears, and the small fruits flourish in all parts of the State.. THE BIRDS OF MAINE. The following list of our birds is that given in the Agricultural Report of Maine for 1861, but without the corresponding scientific names, as found there, \u2014 with additons of a subsequent year. Though every bird of the list sometimes nests in the State, there are several that very rarely do so ; and then at the northern or southern portions, as the Tanager, some of the owls, the hawks and the curlews. It is to be doubted whether the Goiden Eagle exists at all within the limits of Maine at the present time. On the other hand several birds are known in the southern and western parts of the State which are not in the list ; but I am not certain that any of the omitted ones nest in Maine, except the Brown, or Song Thrush, which has come under my own observation, and had been reckoned an inhabitant as far north as Waterville.

The first American legislation in regard to the fisheries was that of Massachusetts in 1639, when the General Court enacted that all vessels and other property employed in \"taking, making and transporting of fish, should be exempt from duties and public taxes for seven years ; and that all fishermen, during the season of their business, should be dispensed from military duty. This so stimulated the business that in 1641, the mariners of that colony followed the fishing so well, that there was above 300,000 dry fish sent to market.\" [Palfrey's History of New England, vol. ii., p. 55.] Almost ever since that time the State, or the national government has stimulated this industry by various bounties and exemptions. In the coast and river fisheries the business has been followed so well that legislation became necessary to protect the fish from destruction, and to re-stock our rivers and ponds. Within a few years past the steps necessary to this end have been taken on all our chief streams and in several ponds, and hundreds of thousands of the young fry have been distributed. The enterprise already shows favorable results and a good promise for the future. The Salmon is the fish for whose introduction the chief effort has been made ; and with such success that they are now observed in streams w-here none had been noticed for years. Yet in the replenished streams they have not increased so as to warrant any attempts at their cap ture. In their report for 1878 the Fish Commissioners say \" the last lingering hold of the salmon of New England is now the two great rivers of Maine, the Penobscot and Kennebec. In the St. Croix and Denny's rivers they are still taken in considerable numbers, but the day of their utter extermination is not far distant.\" Another fish which has been introduced into some of our ponds in the Black Bass. For this numerous calls have been made, mostly to re-stock ponds where the net and spear and grapple of the slouch, and the gluttony of his more respectable brother, the pickerel, had left nothing but the"], [28, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 20 breme and the yellow perch.\" Some forty ponds and streams have therefore been supplied with black bass. There is already excellent fishing for this fish at Phillips's pond in Dedham, Cobbosseecontee pond near Hallowell, Falmouth pond near Portland, and perhaps some others. Many of our ponds in the southern and middle portion of the state have heretofore been stocked with the voracious pickerel, by persons ignorant of their destruction of other fish, or not appreciative of the superior quality of the trout, which it has to a great extent displaced. The latter excellent and much sought fish is still found in most of our ponds and streams, but greatly diminished in size and numbers. In Moosehead lake \u2014 though so large and remote \u2014 the size and numbers of the trout have considerably decreased, owing partly perhaps to the exhaustion of proper food by inferior fishes and the destructive raids of wholesale fishermen at all seasons. The Rangeley lakes have fortu nately an excellent supply of food for their superior species of trout in the small blue-backed trout (salmo oquassa). In 1878, the fish com missioners of the State distributed about 40,000 of the young fry to our different ponds. In a memorandum of fly-fishing for brook trout in Rangeley lake by the commissioners between Oot. 2d and 9th, we find the whole number taken to be 63, \u2014 which averaged above 4f pounds each. The largest fish of this catch weighed 10 pounds, two others, 9 pounds each, two, 8 pounds, and none less than three pounds. This year an 11 lb. trout was taken ; being the largest brook trout (salmo son tinilis) ever taken from the Rmgeley's, or elsewhere, so far as known. After being exhibited in Boston a few days, it was bought by the direction of Professor Baird of the United States fishery commission and forwarded to the Smithsonian Institute at Washington. The Togue (salmo tomah) has been caught of larger size in Moosehead, while some specimens from Sebago lake (salmo sebago) have compared favorably in quality. Successful efforts have also been made toward re-stocking our waters with alewives, which are found to be almost equal to the her ring for food. The Menhaden or pogy fishery question, which occa sioned so much discussion in the legislature for several years, seems to have been settled \u2014 for the time at least \u2014 by nature. Fleets of steamers have for several years swept our coasts, and this not sufficing, they have entered our rivers also. This continual harrying has apparently had its effect ; and the pogy has mostly forsaken our waters. Below is a catalogue of nearly all of the fishes of the interior waters and sea-coast of Maine.

Aroostook county appears to be wholly underlain with calcareous 6late, with these exceptions: in the centre there is a tract imperfectly explored ; others are about the Eagle Lakes, where the rocks are Devo nian ; about the upper lakes of Fish River and of the Allegash, the outcropping is of Trappean and altered rocks; with a tract of the Lower Helderberg group running from Square Lake south-west be tween Long and Portage Lakes ; near range 14 on the eastern border of the State begins a band consisting, first, of slate\u2014 probably of Silu-"], [30, "22 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. rian or Devonian age ; second, of Devonian rocks ; third, slates similar to first. These run south-west until they meet the granite tract about Mount Katahdin. On the east of the Trappean rocks of the Allegash Lakes is also a tract of Devonian rocks, occupying the most of four or five townships. North-west of Katahdin begins a belt of Oriskany sandstone, which sweeps southwest forming the shores of the northern third of Moosehead Lake. After passing the lake the belt broadens, disappearing shortly before reaching Spencer stream, a northern branch of the Dead River. Between the Kennebec and the New Hampshire line, from Mount Bigelow southward to Piscataqua River and the sea, the rock is chiefly syenite, gneiss and mica and talcose schists, \u2014 which alternate with each other to a confusing degree. Sweeping across the State nearly from the eastern border to the Kennebec in a south-west direction, on the south of Katahdin and Moosehead is a belt of clay slate several townships in width. It is from this that our product of roofing slate comes. Its middle section is also highly metalliferous. This belt is, however, cut across by another of argillo-micaceous schist, which comes up from the Penobscot about Bangor, reaching nearly to Moosehead lake. Almost all our coast, also, is of granite and allied rocks. From Rockland to Lewiston tracts of calcareous rock crop out here and there, alternating in this course, with granite, gneiss and mica schist. On all sides of the Cheputneticook Lakes, except the western, is a tract of granite. Adjoining this at the north, is a broad belt of mica schist, which extends north-east to St. John's River, and in the oppo site direction continues to Lee, in Penobscot county. The same is also found on the south of the Cheputneticook Lakes, intruded upon by a belt of granite from the south of the lake that narrows to a point in Topsfield; but the tract of schist continues to the Schoodic Lakes. A broad band of calcareous slates extends from St. Croix River south west to and across the middle portion of the Schoodic Lakes. South of this is a belt of mica schist, extending in the same direc tion, which is succeeded by a broad band of granite, extending from St. Stephen's, in New Brunswick, south-west toward the Penobscot. In the northern part of Mount Desert, and at some points on the main land is found porphyritic granite. Unstratified gravel and clays, in which is usually mingled smoothed and striated boulders, are found everywhere in our State underlying the finer stratified materials. It is the earliest alluvial deposit ; and in the present order of things, always rests upon the solid rock. Bowlders of the Oriskany sandstone are found all over the re<rion south of that belt nearly to the sea. It is quite safe to say that their is not a mountain in Maine of which fragments will not be found scat tered over to the country to the south or south-east. The granite of Mount Katahdin, in boulders of every size, is scattered over the southern part of Penobscot county, and the familiar rocks of mounts Abraham and Blue are recognized among the bowlders of Kennebec county. No bowlders from any eminence are found to the north of it in Maine. We can usually trace them for one hundred and fifty miles from their source. In the east part of Avon is a bowlder of granite which measures 30 by 20 by 15 feet, equal to 9,000 cubic feet, and 643 tons in weight. It was probably derived from the Mount Abraham"], [31, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 23 range of mountains, several miles north. There are doubtless larger bowlders than this in Maine. Another remarkable effect of the drift action is seen in the smooth ing, rounding, scratching and furrowing of the ledges. In Maine, almost invariably, the rocks on the north side of the eminences are smoothed and grooved, while the south side is without either. Often, indeed, both sides are covered with drift material and deposits, so that the rocks are hidden. There have been alternate depressions and elevations of our whole territory in the past ages. The first which we can trace was at the close of the drift period, when there was a sinking of the land below its present level, \u2014 when the waters sifted out the finer materials of the drift, and formed beds of clay and stratified sand. Again, there was a sinking of the land to a greater depth ; and, it is quite likely, to a greater depth in some regions than others. Marine shells have been found in the clays all over the State, showing that for many centuries there were depressions of some 25 feet, and then of a 150 ; and perhaps others to a greater depth. Then there was an elevation of the land. The river beds, then full of sand, clay and gravel, were washed out by the dividing flood, as the land emerged from the sea. These sweeping floods gave place, after centuries to many a series of lakes, whose waters, cutting their way through their alluvial barriers, gradually formed the rivers that drained them. These, wearing deeper and deeper into their beds with each successive season, constantly narrowed their streams as the reservoirs diminished. Thus the successive beds of the river became terraces on their shores, forming sandy plains or rich intervals. There are various minor details of surface geology in Maine not often observed to which we have not space to allude. Of these, the most notable and common are the \" horsebacks,\" to which allusion was made in the article on Valleys. Economic geology must have a little attention. Iron ores in quan tities that would yield a profit to the miner are found at several points in the State. The Katahdin iron works on Pleasant River in Piscata quis County, have long produced an excellent metal from an extensive deposit of bog iron ore found in the vicinity. Dr. Jackson discovered a fine bed of red hematite iron ore in Waite Plantation, Aroostook County. Similar beds are found in Hodgdon and Linneus. There is a bed of bog ore in New Limerick, adjoining the former towns ; also in other parts of the State, in the towns of Newfield, Shapleigh, Ar gyle, Clinton, Williamsburgh, Bluehill, Lebanon, Union, Canton, Paris, Jewell's Island, Thomaston, Bristol, Buckfield, Dixfield, Dover, Farm ington, Greenwood, Jay, Rumford and Winslow. Magnetic iron ore is \"found on Marshall's Island and in Buckfield. Lead ores are found in Lubec (where it is mined) at Kezar Falls, Parsonsfield, in Denmark, Dexter, Corinna, St. Albans and other places. In the middle section of the State small boulders of this ore are rich in silver. Zinc and copper ores are found with the lead at Lubec, West Quoddy Head, in Cutler, and other towns in the southern portions of Washington and Hancock Counties, and in Carroll and at some other points in the eastern part of the Aroostook County. Tin is found at Bluehill in the ore called wolfram, and the metal itself at Mount Mica in Paris. Manganese is found in Thomaston,"], [32, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 24 Bluehill, Paris, Dover, Mount Agamenticus, on the east branch of the Penobscot, Hodgdon, Linneus, Waite, Matagmnoh lake, and numer ous other places. Arsenic is found in arsenical and iron pyrites at Bluehill, i> airfield, Greenwood at Owl's Head in Thomaston, on Bond's Mountain in Newfield, on Titcomb's Hill in Farmington, and other ttrtvns. Gold is found native on Sandy River and its branches, chiefly in the alluvium. It is apparent that the metal must exist in situ in the rocks in the northern part of Franklin county and in the western portion of Somerset. Free gold has also been found in small quantities in Bailey ville and Baring, on the New Brunswick line, in Washington County also in Cherryfield, Columbia and Harrington, in the same county. Some of the silver ores found at Bluehill and Hampden are auriferous. Iron pyrites occur in valuable beds in Brooksville, Hancock Coun ty, Jewell's Island, Casco Bay, Troy, Anson, Farmington, New Limer ick, and other localities. Granite and gneiss \u2014 more or less excellent \u2014 are found in every region of the State. Freestone is obtained from the Devonian sandstones, \u2014 Perry and Machiasport being its chief localities in the southern part of the State. Mica schist is found of good quality for flagging stones at Phipsburg, Winthrop, Acton, Lebanon, and other towns. Of roof ing slate, a grand belt is found, extending from the Kennebec river at Caratunk nearly to the Penobscot river, a distance of 80 miles. Other deposits of this material exist in the northern and southern portions of the State, but the only quarries which have been worked profitably are in the belt above-mentioned. Some of the limestones of the Thomaston belt are fine enough to be termed marbles ; but the use of this stone for making lime is found to yield a surer return than marble quarrying. Union, Sidney, and other places south, yield dolomitic and Lower Helderburg marbles ; while bowlders of very fine statuary marble have been found on the east branch of the Penobscot. Serpentine and steatite are found in Daer Isle, Harpswell Neck, Orr's Island, and Vassalboro ugh. Water lime or cement may be made from the upper Silurian limestones found about Lubec and Pem broke, and westward in various localities to M ichias. Of soils, we have all varieties from pure sand to richest loam. Sandy and gravelly loams are the most common, while clayey loam is frequent, and the intervales of Upper Kennebec, Penobscot and St. John (particularly the latter ) abound in rich vegetable loams. RAILROADS AND TELEGRAPHS. The first railroad in the State for the running of carriages by steam power was the Bangor and Oldtown, or Veazie's Railroad, built in 1836. In the same year a charter was issued for the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth road ; which, however, was not opened for business until 1842. According to the last report of the railroad commissioners (for 1879), we now have 31 railroads (several being branches operated by the larger roads) within the State, whose total length of road is upward of 1,000 miles, which is about 1 mile of railroad to each 33"], [33, "THE STATE OF MAINE. \u00a35 square miles of territory, to each $230,000 of property, and every 644 of the population. The total capital stock of the roads is $20,412, 874,04,\u2014of which $15,906,505,00 is owned outside of the State. These roads employ nearly 3,500 persons. The Aroostook River Railroad runs from the State line, New Bruns wick, a distance of 15 miles. The guage is 3\u00a3 feet.

It is used for the transportation of freight alone."], [35, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 27 There are on these roads'within the limits of the state, 188 stations. Several of the roads operate a telegraph line in connection with their stations. The Atlantic and St. Lawrence (Grand Trunk) Railway own and operate 149-} miles of line ; the Belfast and Moosehead Lake, Boston and Maine, and the Bucksport and Bangor railroads operate 195 miles of line, of which, however, they own but 29. The European and North American Railway operates 114 miles ; the Maine Central, 216; the Portland and Rochester, 52\u00a3 ; and the Rumford Falls and Buck field road, 27\u00a3 miles. The total miles operated by the railroads of the State is 757| miles. There is in the State about 40 telegraph sta tions, having a continental connection, beside those on the railroad lines. Of the lines having a general connection, the Western Union Telegraph Company is the chief proprietor. There are also numerous Telephone lines in the State ; but these rarely exceed a few miles in length. The Portland Railroad is the only horse-railroad in the State run for the use of the public. It has 6f miles of road. CIVIL DIVISIONS AND POPULATION. Maine is divided into sixteen counties ; viz. : Androscoggin, Aroos took, Cumberland, Franklin, Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Sagadahoc, Somerset, Waldo, Wash ington and York. The cities in the order of their population are, \u2014 Portland, Lewiston, Bangor, Biddeford, Auburn, Augusta, Bath, Rockland, Saco, Calais, Belfast, Ellsworth, Gardiner and Hallowell. The cities are governed by a mayor, a board of aldermen, and a common council, who are chosen annually by the people. The whole number of towns, exclusive of the fourteen cities, as given in the State valuation report, 1880, is 412 ; and the number of organized plantations 56. The towns, like the cities, choose their officers annually. The principal officers are three selectmen, a treasurer and collector, a clerk, a supervisor or a committee to super intend the schools, and usually a number of citizens as overseers of the poor, a road surveyor, and other minor officers. At the annual meeting in the spring when the officers are elected, it is usual also to fix upon a sum of money to be raised by taxes upon the property owned in the town, in addition to the usual head tax, for the payment of the town's part of the State and National tax, for the salaries of town officers, the payment of school teachers, the support of the indigent, and other expenses. For school purposes the towns are sometimes divided into districts; and for voting purposes, the cities are divided into wards. The town or city is, however, the unit of civil authority ; the lesser divisions being dependent upon it, and the town or city only being responsible to the State. Our town municipal system allows more freedom to the citizen than any other form of government in ex istence. The officers of a plantation are the same as the principal ones of a town, with the exception that there is a board of three assessors instead of selectmen ; but the powers of a plantation are more limited than those of towns. At the time of the admission of Maine as an independent member of the National Union, it had a population of 298,335, and 59,606 taxable"], [36, "28 GAZETTEER OF MAINE I polls. The number of incorporated towns was 236 ; and the rateable property was valued at $21,000,000. The first state tax was $50,000. The increase of population has been as follows : \u2014 by the census of 1830 it was 399,455; 1840, 501,793; 1850, 583,169; 1860, 628,279; 1870, 626,915 : 1880, 648,945. Of the latter number 160,569 are tax able polls. GOVERNMENT, FINANCES, AND MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS. The government of the State has three departments, \u2014 the execu tive, the legislative and the judicial. The executive department con sists of a Governor, seven Councillors, a Secretary of State, Treasurer, Attorney-General and Adjutant-General. The Governor is chosen by the people once in two years (annually heretofore) on the second Monday in September ; all other executive officers are elected by the Legislature. The legislative department consists of a Senate not less than twenty nor more than thirty-one members, and a House of Representatives, of one hundred and fifty-one members, who are chosen by the people at the same time with the Governor, and hold office for two years follow ing the first Wednesday id January ; at which time the session of the Legislature commences. A bill or resolve, in order to become a law, must receive a majority of the votes in both House and Senate, and receive the signature of the governor \u2014 unless he shall fail to return such bill or resolution within five legislative days, in which case it becomes a law without his signature ; or if it should receive his veto, it may still become a law by receiving two thirds of the votes of each branch of the Legislature. The two United States senators to which the State is entitled are chosen by the Legislature. The Judicial Department consists of a Supreme Judicial Court, having a' Chief Justice and seven Associate Justices. Each county has a Probate Court and a County Commissioner's Court ; and cities and large towns have Municipal and Police courts. Portland and Augusta, in addition to the Police Court, have each a Superior Court, for the trial of cases of higher importance than comes within the jurisdiction of the Police Court, \u2014 thus relieving the Supreme Judicial Court of many of its less important cases. The jurisdiction of the Superior Court extends also over certain adjacent towns. There are in every town trial justices for the settlement of petty cases, and for preliminary action in criminal cases. All the judges are appointed by the Governor, and those of the Supreme Court hold their office for a term of seven years. Maine has five congressional districts, each sending a representative to the lower house of Congress. The first district comprises the counties of York and Cumberland ; the second, the counties of Oxford, Franklin, Androscoggin and Sagadahoc; the third, the counties of Kennebec, Somerset and Lincoln, together with the towns of Washing ton, Union, Warren, Friendship, Cushing, St. George, Thomaston, and the islands of Matinicus, Muscle Ridge, Otter and Cranberry, in Knox county; the fourth is composed of the counties of Penobscot, Piscata quis and Aroostook ; and the fifth, of the counties of Waldo, Hancock aud Washington, together with the towns of Rockland, South Thomas."], [37, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 29 \u2713 ton, Camden, Hope, Appleton, Vinalhaven and North Haven, in Knox county. Maine has seven votes in the electoral college for the choice of President of the United States. The Legislature of the State first met in the court-house in Portland, May 21, 1820, and its sessions continued to be held there until 1832. The act fixing the permanent seat of government at Augusta was passed February 24, 1827. The present Capitol was first occupied by the Legislature on January 4, 1832. The building and furniture cost a little over $125,000, about one-half of this being paid from the proceeds of the sale of ten townships of land. The architect was Charles Bulfinch of Boston. The material is the excellent white granite for which the vicinity is noted. The total valuation of the State in 1880 was : real estate, $165,908, 182; personal, $62,122,474; total estates, $228,030,656. The number of polls was 160,569. The amount of shipping owned in the State as shown in the valuation of 1880 was, in tonnage, 471,068, having a value of $8,678,093. Of cotton mills, the number of spindles was 641,102, and the value $9,261,245. The number of oxen owned in the State was 34,847, valued at $1,420,464 ; of cows, 141,006, valued at $2,953,644; of young cattle, 147,716, valued at $1,799,902; horses, 87,345, valued at $5,037,398 ; colts, 16,654, valued at $559,758 ; sheep, 466,626, valued at $1.316,052 ; swine, 44,927, valued at $249,935. The number of savings banks on November 3, 1879, was 56, and their deposits amounted to $23,052,663. In 1880 there was a net in crease of $1,968,183. The number of national banks at the beginning of 1880 was 69, and their capital stock amounted to $10,388,000. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has recently prepared a table showing the amount of collection of internal revenue returned from the several States for a number of years. The returns from Maine were $75,531 for 1879, against $76,767 for 1880. The number of depositors in savings banks in Maine is 75,543 with $20,978,140 deposited, or $278 to a depositor. The value of imports at Portland, for 1880, was $1,391,086, and exports $3,569,351. The bonded debt of the State on January 1, 1880, was $5,849,900. The total of liabilities over resources at the same date was $6,335, 980.80. The total receipts of the Treasury in 1879 were $1,228,160.94. The expenditures for the same time were $1,316,003.67. The volunteer militia consists of a regiment of infantry, five unat tached companies of infantry, and one company of light artillery. There is also one company of high school cadets, of Bath.

The State has been mindful of the welfare of the unfortunate within her limits, and of the security of her citizens against the evil-disposed ; and in her prisons she has aimed to reform as well as to restrain the criminal. Accordingly, several institutions suited to these different purposes have been provided. The asylum for the insane, at Augusta, affords accommodation for upwards of 400 of this class of unfortunates. At Bath, the State has an asylum for the needy orphan children of those who have served their country in the army or navy. The inmates are freely admitted to the excellent schools of the city, and are regular and welcome atten dants of the churches and Sabbath schools. At the commencement of the year 1879 there were 66 children in this Home. The Reform School at Cape Elizabeth is reaching a condition in which it really deserves its name. The number of boys under instruc tion at the commencement of the year 1879 was 141, and there were 28 received during the year. During the same time 47 have been dis charged. With respect to the latter, it is hoped that most of them will become not only harmless but valuable members of the com munity. The Maine Industrial School for Girls, located at Hallowell, is a private corporation, but it is in a large degree the beneficiary of the State; the latter being represented in its management by the Governor, the Secretary of State and the Superintendent of Common Schools. The legislature has provided by statute law for the custody and educa tion of wayward and exposed girls therein, and aids in their material support. The influence of the school on the character of those com mitted to its charge have already proved quite gratifying. The insti tution is the object of many donations from benevolent citizens of the State. Maine General Hospital, at Portland, was opened for patients in 1874. It is governed by a Board of Directors, six of whom are chosen by the corporation, and four by the Board of Visitors. The State prison is located at Thomastown. The system now- in operation for the treatment of prisoners includes employment, education and religious instruction. In the matter of discipline, the Commuta tion law \u2014 by which a deduction is made from the term of service for good behavior \u2014 is working very favorably. The general government has two charitable asylums in Maine, the Marine Hospital at Falmouth, and the Togus Military Asylum at Chel sea, near Augusta. EDUCATION, LITERATURE, AND THE PUBLIC PRESS. At the time w-hen Maine became a State there were within its limits twenty- four incorporated academies ; that of Portland, established in 1784, being the oldest. Probably not one-half as many are now in op-"], [39, "THE STATE OF MAINE. \u00a71 eration ; the town high schools, the Normal schools, the seminaries and colleges have succeeded to their places. Nearly every town of above one thousand inhabitants sustains a high school for a portion of the year. The school mill tax on corpora tions has contributed largely to this result. By the report of the Superintendent of Schools for 1879 we find that the estimated value of all public school property in the State in that year was $2,947,655 The number of school houses was 4,263, of which 70 had been built during the year. At the same date the total number of children in the State between the ages of four and twenty-one was 215,724. The amount of money actually expended for public schools from April 1, 1878 to April 1, 1879, was $984,108. F There are now three State Normal Schools exclusively for the train ing of teachers. These are located respectively at Farmington, Cas tine and Gosham. The State also sustains a training teacher in the Madawaska region. The Oak Grove Seminary, at Vassalboro and the Maine Central Institute, at Pittsfield, each graduate a class annually from a Normal department, receiving aid from the State to the amount of $600 each. The Maine Wesleyan Seminary, at Kent's Hill, also has a Normal course, as well as a course in almost every desirable department for a school of this grade. The Eastern Conference Seminary and Com- mercial College at Bucksport, like the former, is a Methodist Institu- tion. It is an excellent school and well patronized. Westbrook Seminary, a school of excellent reputation, is the prin- ciple institution of learning of the Universalist denomination in Maine. It is pleasantly located at Steven's Plains, in Westbrook. Other excel- lent schools are the Wendell Institute, in Farmington, for young ladies and gentlemen, and the famous Little Blue School, in the same town for boys only. Another institution under State patronage is the State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, opened at Orono in 1868. The num- ber of pupils, male and female, at the close of 1879 was 102. It has a faculty of seven professors and an instructor in iron work. Our oldest collegiate institution is Bowdoin College, at Brunswick, whose President is Joshua L. Chamberlain, formerly Major-General of Volunteers in the war of the rebellion, and later, Governor of Maine four years. The institution is under the patronage of the Congrega- tionalists, though the students are not unduly influenced by the author- ities in religious matters. The Hallowell Classical and Scientific Academy is the chief fitting school for Bowdoin, and has also finished courses of its own. Colby University, at Waterville, is beautifully situated, and is a well appointed institution. It is under the patronage of the Baptists. The Classical Institute, in the same town, is the principal fitting school. Bates College, at Lewistown, is a young but flourishing institution under the patronage of the Free Baptist denomination. The Nichols Latin School, near by, is the principal fitting school. A Theological Seminary also forms a department of the college. The Theological Seminary at Bangor is the oldest religious school in the State. It was incorporated in 1814 under the name of the Maine Charity School. It went into operation at Hampden in 1817, and removed to Bangor in 1819. The institution is Congregationalist."], [40, "32 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Further facts in regard to schools may be found under the heads of the towns where they are located. The libraries in Maine are numerous, but small. There is scarcely a city without a library which is accessible to the public at little or no cost to the patrons. Most of the villages also have private circulating libraries. The first newspaper published in Maine was the \" Falmouth Gazette and Weekly Advertiser\" of Portland ; and its first number was issued on the 1st of January 1785. Its publishers were Mr. Benjamin Tit comb, a Portland printer, and Thomas B. Waite, who had previously been concerned in the \" Boston Chronicle!\" The paper went through various changes of ownership and title, until about 1826, when it took as its name the \"Portland Advertiser.\" In 1831, the \" Daily Advertiser\" began to be published consecutively. In 1829, Mr. James Brooks be came editor of the paper, and continued in that relation until 1836, when he started the \" New York Express.\" Mr. James G. Blaine was its editor in 1858. In 1859 it passed under the control of Messrs Wal dron, Little & Co. ; and in January, 1861, it was sold to Mr. F. O. J. Smith. In his hands the political attitude of the paper suffered, and its circulation diminished ; and at the date of the great fire in Port land, its daily issue was suspended. In 1868 it passed into new hands and Republican management, and appeared as an evening paper \u2014 and thus continues to the present time. The \" Christian Mirror \" has now reflected its light upon the world weekly for above half a century. It owes its existence to the zeal in spired by that eminent Trinitarian Congregationalist, Rev. Edward Payson, \u2014 its founders being members of his church. Its first editor was Rev. Asa Rand. \" Zion's Advocate \" first appeared about 53 years ago. It was printed by Day & Sumner, and edited by Rev. Ad.'im Wilson. In 1859 it passed into the hands of Dr. Shailer and J. W. Colcord, who have conducted it with great success. \" The Daily Eastern Argus\" was started in 1835, and has been is sued continuously, and without change of title since that time. In 1866, Mr. G. M. Gage, then principal of the Western Normal School at Farmington started an educational monthly entitled \" The Maine Normal.\" Two years later its place of publication was changed to Portland, where it took the new name of the \" Journal of Educa tion.\" A few years later it was merged into the \" New England Journal of Education,\" \u2014 its editor being continued as the editor of the Maine Department of the latter journal. The first newspaper in Brunswick was issued by Joseph Griffin, in 1820, under the name of \" The Maine Intelligence'r.\" It had a brief but brilliant existence of only six months. \" The Brunswick Tele graph \" was started in 1853 by Waldron and Moore, with William G. Barrows, Esq., as editor. The \"Bridgton News\" was established by H. A. Shorey, Esq., at Bridgton Centre in 1870. The \" Kennebec Farmer \" was started in Winthrop in 1833, with Dr. Ezekiel Holmes, editor. It was published in Hallowell in 1857, then again removed to Winthrop. In 1844 it was purchased by Russell Eaton, Esq., and removed to Augusta, where it has ever since remained, its name meantime having been changed to \" Maine Farmer.\""], [41, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 33 The \" Bangor Daily Whig \" arose from the \" Bangor Courier,\" es tablished in 1833 to support the principles of the Whig party, then just organized. In 1834, its founder, Mr. Wm. E. P. Rogers, estab lished with the \"Courier\" a daily paper, styled \"The Bangor Whig.\" Before the end of the year, the two names were joined in the daily, forming the present title, which bids fair to continue long unchanged. It is now published by Boutelle and Burr. \" The Gospel Banner \" was established by Rev. Wm. A. Drew in 1835, as the representative of the Universalist denomination ; which purpose it still retains. Its present owner is Rev. George W. Quinby. The \" Kennebec Journal \" was established in the autumn of 1823, by Luther Severance and Russell Eaton. \" The Daily Kennebec Journal\" was commenced in 1870, by Sprague, Owen & Nash, who had become proprietors of the w-eekly. Both are now owned by Sprague & Son. The first genuine newspaper published within the limits of the present county of Androscoggin was the \"Lewiston Journal.\" Wil liam H. Waldron was its founder; and it was edited by Dr. Alonzo. Garcelon. In 1857 the paper passed wholly into the hands of Nelson. Dingley, Jr. In 1861, Mr. Dingley, associated with F. L. Dingley, be gan the publication of the \" Daily Evening Journal.\" Both this and, the weekly have become models of their kind, and have steadily in creased in circulation. The total number of periodicals now published in the State is 114. Of these 11 are dailies, 1 is tri-weekly, 1 semi-weekly, 79 are weeklies, 2 are semi-monthlies, 18 are monthlies and 2 are quarterlies. Mention of these various periodicals will be made under the head of the towns where they are published. RELIGION. A form of religious polity was first established by law in Maine in 1639, by the charter of the Province of Maine. Heretofore there had been no limitations in the matter of religious faith or practice, and this still continued to be the case, east of the Kennebec. Weymouth, the first explorer of Maine, carrying the appearance of government author ity, set up crosses as a token of possession by the King of England and head of the Christian church in that country. The Popham colony, which located at the mouth of the Kennebec, was spiritually under the charge of Richard Seymour, a clergyman of the Church of England, and the first minister who resided in Maine.. Though having all the right that could be derived from his govern ment to control public worship in his province, Gorges seems never to have made any discrimination in religious. opinions in respect to property or citizenship; but the officers of the government he organ ized appear to have been adherents of the Church of England, yet not generally strenuous in their opinions or practice. The settlement- on the Saco effected a sufficient religious organization among themselves to choose a member of their community as an exhorter\u2014 which suggests . that the majority of the settlers there may have been Antinomian im their views. This is the first mention of a religious minister within the present limits of the State,\u2014 except the Roman Catholic. Mem bers of one or another order of that church were frequently, if not con- 3"], [42, "34 GJiZETTEER OF MAINE stantly, on the coast somewhere from Penobscot to Annapolis in Nova Scotia, after 1604. In 1637, Richard Gibson, a clergyman of the Church of England, ministered to the spiritual wants of the people from Casco Bay to the Isles of Shoals. He was \" highly esteemed as a gospel minister, especially by the settlers and fishermen at Richmond's Island and on the Isles of Shoals.\" He returned to England in 1643. Another Episcopal clergyman, Rev. Robert Jordan, came over from England in 1640, at the age of twenty-eight. He lived in the country thirty-nine years, administering the ordinances under the Episcopal form, and preaching occasionally for thirty-six years. During all this time there was freedom of religious opinion and practice in the province, except when the Massachusetts authorities forbade the administration of the ordinances in the Episcopal form, and interfered with the meet- ings of Baptists and Quakers. East of Kennebec the Presbyterians, Lutherans, and such others as held meetings found opposition from the government. After the restoration of Charles II. to the throne of England, the public feeling became effective against any interference of government with worship, except to protect the rights of worshippers of all opinions. A noted Puritan minister in Maine at this time was the Rev. John Brock, who principally resided at the Isles of Shoals. He was a man \u25a0of fervent faith, and a useful pastor. A later member of the Puritan clergy was the Rev. George Burroughs, a graduate of Harvard College in 1678. He began to preach at Falmouth in 1674, but, with other inhabitants, was driven away by the Indians in 1676. Returning in 1683, he was again driven away when the town was sacked by savages in 1690. He then took up his residence near Salem, and, two years later, became one of the victims of the witchcraft delusion. He appears to have been a man of learning, piety and misfortune. The next clergyman requiring mention is the Rev. Samuel Moody, who graduated at Harvard College in 1697, and was settled as the first minister in York in 1700. He was a \" zealous, faithful and successful pastor,\" remaining in connection with this church until his death in 1747. About 1744, there was a considerable revival of religion in the southern part of the State, to which a few sermons of George White field contributed much. At the time that Maine became a State, there were within its limits three Episcopal churches ; two Roman Catholics, with a membership of about 500 ; in 1750, there were twelve Presbyterian churches within the limits of the State, but in 1820 these organizations had all died out, and those remaining of the members had generally become merged with the Congregationalist. The last was the permanent form into which Puritanism became cast in this county. At the time of the erection of Maine into a State it had 130 churches, and by estimation, 6,000 members. The Baptists at the same time had 9,328 members, and 109 ordained elders; the Methodists had 73 located ministers, and 6,192 members. The number of Friends or Quakers, at this date, was about 2,000, constituting thirty societies. The Shakers had three societies, at Gorham, New Gloucester and Alfred. The religious denominations in Maine at the beginning of the year 1880, number thirteen. The Advent Christians have 105\\?hurches, 48 ministers, and a membership of about 3,000. The Baptists have 263"], [43, "THE STATE OF MAINE 35 s churches, 181 ministers, and 21,165 members. The Protestant Episco pal Church has 35 parishes and missions, 25 ministers, and 2,107 com municants. The Free Baptists have 281 churches and a membership of 15,870. The Congregationalists have 243 churches, 190 ministers, 21,558 members, and 22,131 scholars in Sabbath schools. The Maine conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church has 120 churches, valued at $539,700 ; 61 parsonages, estimated worth $75,000; 125 ministers; a membership of 11,649; and 1,667 probationers. The East Maine Conference of the same body has 111 churches, valued at $325,200; 65 parsonages, valued at $62,450 ; 112 ministers, 11 of whom are native Chinese missionaries; 9,435 members, and 3,287 probationers. The Universalists have 88 parishes, 4,525 families, and 45 church organizations. Their Sabbath School scholars number 6,477; the value of the church property is $567,450 ; and they have 44 preachers. The Unitarians have 21 churches, but I am unable to state the member ship or the number of ministers. The New Jerusalem Church has five churches in the State, with a membership of 341. The \" Christians \" have about 60 ministers, and a membership of nearly 6,000. The \" Disciples \" have 9 churches with a membership of about 500. The Lutherans have two churches, and about 500 members. The Roman Catholic \" Diocese of Portland \" embraces Maine and New Hampshire. In Maine it has 49 churches, 40,000 communicants and 40 priests. Its religious institutions are 4 academies for girls, 3 orphan asylums, and 11 parochial schools. The \" Church of God \" was organized as a church body in 1830 in Pennsyl vania. Its first church in Maine was founded in Palmyra in 1873. Its communicants within the State number about 1,500. INDIANS. The aboriginal inhabitants of Maine constituted the Abnaki nation. The oldest tribe was the Sokokis, who dwelt upon the Saco river. The age of the tribes decreased according to distance eastward from this. The Openangoes, or Quoddy Indians were in fact scarcely known as a tribe until after the Revolution. They were probably made up of a few Tarratines and of some of the Marechites from St. John's river, who favored the American cause at that period. The Tarratine was the most numerous tribe. The Canibas tribe occupied the Kennebec river, havingtheir principal settlement near Norridgewock. The Anasagunti cooksoccupied the Androscoggin river. During the summer all the tribes spent much time on the sea-shore, where, like their successors, they subsisted largely on fish. With the overthrow of the French power in Canada the Indians of Kennebee and the rivers westward mostly retired to the rivers north west of Maine on the south side of the St. Lawrence. In 1614, when Captain John Smith visited our shores, their number according to the best estimate must have been about 30,000. Wars with the Mohawks and of the tribes among themselves occurred at about that time, followed by a destructive pestilence in 1616 and 1617,\u2014 by which their numbers were greatly reduced. In 1675, when the first war broke out between them and the English settlers of Maine and Massachusetts, they num bered about 12,000. Of the remnants of the Tarratines and of the Openangoes, the first"], [44, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 36 reside in Oldtown on the Penobscot, and the other at Pleasant Point near Perry, and on the Indian township at the Schoodic Lakes. These are the beneficiaries of the State, having given up all their lands except the tracts about a township in extent each,\u2014 assigned to their exclusive use. In 1879, the Penobscots numbered 446; and the amount expended for them by the State Government in that year was $7,554.26. The Quoddy tribe numbered at the same period 523; and the expenditures of the State on them was $5,547.35. Both tribes have an ample extent of good land, and efforts to induce them to give more attention are meeting with some success. CIVIL HISTORY. Undoubtedly the shores of Maine were first seen by European eyes \u2014 about A.D. 996. The historic records of Norway, Denmark and Iceland show that a Northman named Biarne, sailing for Greenland, was in that year driven by gales far to the south. From his vague descriptions of the voyage, it is surmised that he caught sight of Cape Cod, and after the storm was over coasted back along the shores of Maine and Nova Scotia to Greenland. Again in 1008, an expedition from Greenland passed along within view of Maine, on its way to Narraganset Bay, where a former expedi tion had erected huts. This location was known to the Northmen as \" Vineland,\" having received this name from them on account of the wild grape vines found there. The leader of the expedition was a wealthy citizen of Iceland, named Thorfinn ; and his company consisted of 160 men, in three ships. The noted stone tower at Newport is claimed by some to be a relic of these visitors ; but there exists un impeachable evidence that it is a portion of a wind-mill erected by Governor Arnold, of Rhode Island, not far from the year 1653. The next European who looked upon Maine was probably Sebas tian Cabot, who set out with two ships from Bristol, England, in May, 1498. He is said to have sailed along the coast of the Gulf of Maine, scanning the shores from his ship somewhat carefully ; yet no definite record exists of his ob servations here. Gasper Cortereal, OLD STONE TOWER, OR MILL, NEWPORT. a Spanish explorer (who visited our coast in A.D. 1500), did better ; but he only alluded to the country generally as aboundingin forests and large rivers, and having its waters well stocked with fish. He adds that the region is well adapted for ship-building. In all of these points he was right; but he kidnapped fifty-seven of the natives, intending to sell them for slaves, and therefore sinks in our esteem. One of his vessels, containing himself, with alarge portion of his spoils, did not reach Spain, nor was its fate ever known. Verrazano, an Italian, was the next navi gator on the coast. He was sent out by the King of France in 1523, returning the next year. It is possible that Maine was the scene of the"], [45, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 37 traffic he carried on with the Indians, who let down from the craggy rocks with ropes \" whatever they were pleased to offer, demanding in return, knives, fishhooks and tools.\" Charles V. of Spain, in 1525, sent Estevan Gomez to the western seas to find the way to the East Indies. It can only be said of this voyager, that he entered some of the Bays' of New England, and named the whole country for himself, \" The Country of Gomez.\" Again in 1556 a French gentleman and scholar, named Andre Thevet sailed in a French ship along the whole coast. He applied the name \" Norumbega \" to the Penobscot River, but says that the natives called it Agoncy. He spent several days in the vicinity of Penobscot Bay, where he held conferences with the natives. He also speaks of a fort built on this river by the French in a former time, and named by them the Fort cf Norumbega. The Englishman, John Rut, in a ship, \" The Mary of Guilford \" made a voyage to the coast of Maine in 1567, but no definite record of where he touched or what he did, has come down to us. Nearly half a century passes before we hear anything again from the coast of Maine. Bartholomew Gosnold, an English voyager, is said to have touched Maine near Mount Desert in 1602. The next year Mar- tin Pring, with two vessels, \" The Speedwell \" and \" The Discoverer,\" 6ailed from Milford Haven with goods suited for a trade with the Indians. He entered Penobscot Bay on the 7th of June, being delighted with everything, \u2014 anchorage, fishing, beautiful and impressive scenery, and luxuriant vegetation. Seeing some foxes on one of the islands, led them to apply the name \" Fox Islands,\" still borne by this group. From here they sailed past the beautiful islands of Casco Bay, and ascended the Saco River. They are also believed to have visited the Kennebunk and York Rivers. Finding in Maine nothing but furs, they went further south for sassafras, and reached home with a valu- able cargo. In 1604, De Monts, a Frenchman, came to Passamaquoddy Bay, and settled his company of about eighty on an island in the St. Croix River, now known as \"Neutral Island.\" He had a patent from Henry IV. of France to the region between the fortieth and forty-sixth degrees of latitude, with no western boundary but the Pacific Ocean. This extensive territory bore the name of Acadia ; but its southern limits first slipped back to the Kennebec River, then to the Penobscot, and finally it lingers only as a historic or fanciful title for the Provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. During the winter, thirty-five of De Mont's colonists died ; and after a voyage along the coast as far as Cape Cod, he returned, and, together with another ship with colonists, founded Port Royal (now Annapolis) in Nova Scotia. The next year the English government sent a fine vessel \u2014 \"The Archangel \" \u2014 to the coast of Maine. She was under the command of George Weymouth ; and her special mission seemed to be to take pos- session of the country in the name of the king. This he did by setting up a cross at Monhegan, and at other extreme points of his explora- tions. Sailing westward to the mainland, he entered a fine haven, which he named Pentecost Harbor. Here they planted peas, barley and other seeds, which was the first English planting in Maine. De Monts, the same season, had sown grain on Neutral Island ; so that the French may claim the honor of early cultivation at the border."], [46, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 38 Weymouth remained on the coast about a month, during which time he explored a river variously claimed to be the Penobscot, St. George s and Kennebec, ascending about sixty miles, and carried on some social intercourse with Indians, as well as trade. He ended his operations on our coast by kidnapping five natives, not to make slaves of them, but Christians. On his return he appears to have discovered the fishing ground at George's Banks, not known before. In 1606, the \" North and South Virginia Company ' was formed in England for the purpose of colonization. Soon after, the territory covered by their patent was divided, the London members of the com pany taking the southern portion and the south of England members, under the name of the Plymouth Company, taking the northern portion. The London Company in the following year sent a colony to Virginia, and this was followed the same year by the Plymouth Company's colony under Sir George Popham at Sagadahoek. Their two ships were named the \" Mary and John \" and \" The Gift of God.\" The company consisted of 120 persons, but it is not clear whether this included the crews of the vessels. They built their log huts, a chapel, and a fort enclosing a storehouse on the peninsula of Sabino, \u2014 now apart of the town of Phipsburg. A strong fort of stone, built by our national government, now occupies a prominent point of the peninsula. Various misadventures with the savages, the sickness and death of their president, so discouraged the colonists, that when one of their vessels arrived from England in the spring all left the place. In 1613, a French colony of about 25 persons settled on Mount Desert, but before their slight fort was completed, they were captured or driven off by Captain Argal, of the Virginia colony. The next notable visit to our shores was that of the famous Captain John Smith; who, with two vessels, spent the season of 1614 upon the New England coast, of which he afterwards made a map. Thomas Hunt, the master of one of the vessels, lingered behind and stole 27 savages, whom he sold to the Spaniards at Malaga. Soon after Smith's visit the Indians were afflicted with a plague which carried oft great numbers of them. An educated physician, Richard Vines, with a small vessel of Sir Ferdinand Gorges, spent the winter of 1616-17 at the mouth of the Saco River, often ministering to the suffering natives. In 1619, the coast was hastily visited by Captain Dermer, also in the employ of Gorges, who came to make peace with the natives ; who were justly incensed at the outrages of nearly every English ship which had visited them. In December, 1620, the Pilgrims settled at Plymouth in Massa chusetts; and in 1623 there was a well-established colony on the Saco River, settled by Vines. There appear, also, to have been some irreg ular settlements at Monhegan and Pemaquid at about the same time. The first Indian deed executed in America appears to have been that given by Samoset, a Maine chieftain, to John Brown in 1625. It comprised the present towns of Bristol and Damariscotta. In 1622 the Plymouth Company granted to Gorges and Mason, under the name \" Laconia,\" the territories extending from the Kennebec to the Merrimac River, and westward to the great lakes. Of this, Gorges took the section north of the Piscataqua River for his portion ; and in this manner was originated the southern boundary of Maine, In 1627, the patent of the Massachusett's Bay Company was granted to a com-"], [47, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 39 pany who proved to be rank Puritans. In 1629, The Plymouth Com pany granted to the New Plymouth colony a tract of land 15 miles wide on each side of the Kennebec River, and extending from Swaii Island to the great bend in the river near Norridgewock. In the same year grants were also made to the settlers on the Saco River. One patent was issued to Richard Vines and John Oldham, of a tract of 4 miles on the shore and 8 miles back from the river, on the southerly side ; and another to Thomas Lewis and John Bonython of a similar tract on the northerly side. In 1630 the Lygonia Patent, sometimes called the \" Plough Patent \" was granted to a company who proposed to devote their energies to agriculture. The patent appears to have been granted under a mis conception, as it interfered with the rights of Gorges and was the cause of much strife in the early years of the settlements. The terri tory purporting to be conveyed, was 40 miles square, extending on the coast from the Kennebunk to Royal's River. In the same year the territory between Muscongus Bay and Medomac River was granted to some persons who had trading houses there. This was the Muscon gus Patent, which, nearly a hundred years later, passed into the pos session of the Waldo family, and thus became known as the \" Waldo Patent.\" The Pemaquid Patent, issued in 1631, was the last issue by the Plymouth Company in Maine. It included the territories lying between the Medomac and Damariscotta rivers. West of this was the \" Sheepscot plantation \" in what is now the town of Newcastle. In 1632 commenced the troubles with the French, which continued until the fall of Quebec, in 1759. The first act of hostility was the plunder of the Pilgrim's trading station on the Penobscot by a party of French fishermen who thought themselves excused from punishment for the outrage by the French claim to the territory. Another was the plunder of the trading vessel of Dixy Bull ; and this misfortune caused Bull to turn plunderer also. After robbing several small ves sels he made an attack, in 1632, upon Pemaquid, but was beaten off without having secured much plunder. A force of four vessels from Massachusetts Bay and Piscataqua River was sent in pursuit of the marauder ; but he had left the coast. He was subsequently executed in England. In 1635 the Plymouth or New England Company was dissolved, and its territory was divided into twelve provinces, four of which fell within the present limits of Maine. The first, including the region between the Penobscot and St. Croix, was assigned to Sir William Alexander, and was named the County of Canada ; the second lay between the Penobscot and Kennebec, and was given to the Duke of York, who soon named it the County of Cornwall ; the third embraced the territory between the Kennebec and Androscoggin ; the fourth division extended from the Androscoggin to the Pascataqua. Both the last were given to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who named his province \"New Somersetshire.\" In 1636 Gorges, nephew, William Gorges, came over as Governor ; but he soon returned to England. Three years later, Gorges procured a charter from the King, giving him rights of government in his province. Its name he now changed to Maine, \u2014 whence we obtain the name of our State. In 1642 Gorges planned the capital city of his province, locating it on the York River. It had been known as the plantation of Agamenticus, but he now"], [48, "40 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. changed it to Goigeana, extending its corporate jurisdiction over a tract of twenty-one square miles. It never had over three hundred inhabitants, and ten years later, it was changed to the town of York. Before long there were conflicts of title and of authority in Maine among so many different claimants. The French made good their claim to the territory east of the Penobscot by holding possession of i,; aal unon Gorges' death those holding their territory under the Lygonia Patent contended with those who held under the several patents of Gorges. The government of Cromwell during its sway, favored Rigby, the holder of the Lygonia Patent \u2014 and a Puritan \u2014 against Gorges, who was attached to the Church of England and the royal line. The Massachusetts Bay Government was frequently called upon for protection and adjudication of rights in Maine ; and, on re examining their charter, and making a new survey, the authorities found they could make a plausible claim of jurisdiction over New Hampshire and Maine as far as the Penobscot. This territory was therefore adopted as apart of the commonwealth, under the name of Yorkshire. In 1652, commissioners appointed by Massachusetts came into Maine, and set up her government with very little opposition. The militia of Maine was organized by the General Court, and magis trates appointed ; the people were admitted to suffrage, having the privilege of sending two delegates to the General Court. Under the Puritan rule in England, the New England colonies, with the assistance of a few vessels and men sent by Cromwell, recov ered from France the whole of Acadja, \u2014 by which term the French at this time designated eastern Maine, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In 1664, Charles II., who had now been called to the throne of Great Britain, made his brother, the Duke of York, Viceroy of New England. The Duke also induced his brother to give the portion of Maine lyintr between St. Croix and the Penobscot, in addition to that between the latter river and the Kennebec, which he held before. At the request of the Duke, the King appointed three commissioners to assist the deputy-governor, Colonel Richard Nichols, in settling the affairs of New England. When they appeared in Boston, the General Court rejected their authority. They then went to Maine, where in 1665, they overthrew the government of Massachusetts and set up one of their own. The King recalled the commissioners in the following year, and when Governor Nichols returned to England in 1668, Massachu setts immediately took steps to revive her authority. In 1773, the Dutch recaptured New York, and Governor Lovelace, who had suc ceeded Nichols, returned to England. There being now no superior authority to oppose, the authority of Massachusetts quickly changed the province of Maine back to the county of York and made the county of Cornwall into the county of Devonshire; and now Maine had three representatives in the General Court. Then for a short time the settlements were peaceful and flourishincr ; so that in the beginning of the year 1675, there were thirteen towns and plantations within the present limits of Maine, while the inhabitants numbered between five and six thousand souls. The Indian popula tion at this time numbered about twelve thousand. In July 1675, Kino- Philip's war broke out in Massachusetts ; and in September the tribes of Maine commenced hostilities. Their first warlike act was at the plantation of Thomas Purchas, in Pejepscot (Brunswick), which they"], [49, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 41 plundered. They next fell upon the settlers at Falmouth, burning their buildings, and slaughtering the inhabitants with horrible barbarity. At Biddeford, houses were burned and Major Philip's garrison house, in which the inhabitants had taken refuge, was besieged ; but all succeeded in escaping to the settlement at Winter Harbor. Sixteen men from South Berwick on the way to succor the inhabitants on Saco River, were attacked by a large number of savages, and nine men from Winter Harbor who sought to join their friends, were ambushed and every man shot down. During this time, another band of savages attacked Newichawannock, secreting themselves in the vicinity several days, and effecting much slaughter upon incautious persons, and the armed parties who sought them. The hostilities of the first season lasted about three months, during which time eighty persons were killed by the savages, and several small settlements destroyed. The settlers now organized a considerable force for an attack upon the Indians in their winter quarters ; upon which a number of the sagamores appeared and made a treaty of peace with the English, and promised to restore captives. The winter wore on, but few captives were brought in ; and fears of a renewal of the hostilities increased. There was good reason for it. Major Waldron, one of the Indian commissioners, was so imprudent as to issue general warrants by which any man holding the warrant could seize any Indian who might be accused of killing a white man. Several ship-masters secured warrants, and seized many Indians along the coast; and carrying them to a foreign port, sold them for slaves. To pacify the Indians, Abraham Shurte and Captain Davis met the chiefs in council at Teconnet : The first was the noble and venerable chief magistrate at Pemaquid ; and such was the respect of the Indians for him, and such the good treatment they received from the settlers in his jurisdiction that not a hamlet was attacked during the first year of the war. At the council, the chiefs demanded that their brothers who had been stolen away, should be restored to tin m, and that the English should sell them food and ammunition for their hunting. These were reasonable requests, but the agents were unable to comply with them ; and the council broke up without profit. The death of King Philip, in August, 1676, which ended the war in Massachusetts, only increased the violence of the savages in Maine. The hostilities commenced by an attack upon Falmouth at about the time of Philip's death; and this was followed in a few days by an attack upon Arrowsie. In a short time all the settlements east of Falmouth were swept away. The savages then swarmed about the few remaining settlements between Falmouth and Piscataqua, killing and burning whenever they found opportunity. As before, when the cold weather came on, the Indians retired to their winter quarters ; and as before, the settlers prepared to attack them ; but on marching against them, not an Indian could be found. In November, a noted Penobscot sagamore, named Mugg, came to Piscataqua, and desired to make a treaty. He promised that all acts of hostility should cease, that all English captives, vessels and goods should be restored, and that his tribe should buy ammunition only of those whom the governor should appoint, and that the Indians of Penobscot should take up arms against the Androscoggins and other eastern natives, if they persisted in the war. The only performance was the buying of ammunition when they could get it, and the restoration of some eighteen or twenty prisoners ; though the tribes must have had"], [50, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 42 more than fifty. In February, 1677, majors Waldron and Frost with a hundred and fifty men made a voyage along the coast as far as Penob scot, to see what the Indians were about, to obtain captives, and obtain renewed pledges. The expedition proved of no advantage. In March the savages began their destructions again, by killing nine of a party of English who visited Arrowsie for the purpose of burying the dead bodies of their countrymen of that place, killed the autumn before. Some of the Indians employed themselves in capturing the fishing vessels and islands, while others attacked at various times, nearly or quite all of the five settlements remaining in Maine \u2014 York, Wells, Kittery, Newichawannock and Winter Harbor. In the month of July the savages captured about twenty fishing vessels. When this warfare became known, a large armed vessel was sent to recapture them. Such as they found were abandoned, the Indians not having been able to manage them. The English now had more men in service, they had learned the Indian methods of fighting, and in several engage ments the savages suffered severely ; in one, their great leader, Magg, was killed. Discouraged by the failure of the naval project of capturing Boston, by their defeats, the loss of their leader, and their own exhaustion, the Indians now wished to close the war. Accordingly the next spring the Commissioners of Massachusetts and the sagamores of the Sokokis, Androscoggins and Canibas met at Casco (Portland) and made a treaty, whose terms were that all captives should be restored without ransom, and that the inhabitants should possess their lands on condition of paying to the natives a peck of corn annually for each family. In this war two hundred and sixty inhabitants of Maine were known to have been killed, or carried into captivity from which they never returned ; while mjre than half the settlements were laid waste. In 1677 the Massachusetts Colony purchased the Province of Maine from the heirs of Gorges for the sum of \u00a31,250 sterling. In 1680, a government was organized for the Province in conformity with the pro visions of the charter. This government consisted of a Provincial President, chosen annually by the M issaehusetts Board of Assistants, a standing Council of eight members, and a House of Deputies chosen by towns as in Massachusetts. The Council, appointed by the Board of Assistants, were the judges constituting the Supreme Court. The first president was Thomas Danforth, at that time Deputy Gover nor of Massachusetts. In 1687, Sir Edmund Andros, previously governor of New York, was appointed Governor of New England also. In making an eastern trip he visited and plundered the establishment of Baron Cas tine at Biguyduce (now Castine), and bestowed liberal gifts upon the Indians whom he met to secure their good-will. Two months later the Indians commenced the hostilities of the first French and Indian war. The settlements destroyed in the first Indian war, but since re occupied, were now assailed again, and much havoc was effected. Yet the inhabitants were now better prepared for the foe, many having do<*s which gave notice of their approach, while the houses were more gen erally constructed with a view to defense. Governor Andros stilf en deavored to propitiate the tribes, but utterly failing of success he took another turn, and in November sent eight hundred men along the Maine coast. They suffered much, but were forced to return without seeing a single Indian. In the spring the Massachusetts people heard of the"], [51, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 43 revolution in England, and seizing Andros, sent him home. With the warmer weather came also the renewed atrocities of the war ; the de structive raids of the French and their savage allies being now ex tended along the whole interior line of New England settlements. In 1690, an expedition was sent against the French in Acadia, under Sir William Phips. Phips was a native of Woolwich in Maine, who by his good parts had risen to eminence. The expedition was entirely successful ; and another expedition being sent against Quebec, the French mostly withdrew from Maine. The Quebec expedition was unfortunate, and returned unsuccessful. The great expense induced the Massachusetts government for the first time to issue paper money for relief. Every town in Maine east of Wells bad now been destroyed. While the Quebec expedition was in progress, Major Church, of Mas sachusets, with a small force of militia, landed at Brunswick, and marching up the Androscoggin, captured the Indian fort at the great falls at Lewiston. There were few attacks from the Indians during the remainder of the season ; and at the last of November six Saga mores met the Massachusetts Commissioners at Sagadahoc, surrendered a few prisoners and signed a truce. The latter was to be succeeded in May by a treaty ; but instead, the savages were found to be preparing to renew the war. The French not coming to their aid they kept up through the season a skulking warfare about the settlements, destroy ing cattle, burning buildings, and killing or taking captive lone indi viduals \u2014 men, women and children. The next year the French joined them again ; and hostilities were resumed in a sudden attack upon York by two or three hundred savages led by Frenchmen. But the enemy could not prevail as formerly. By the charter of William and Mary, Massachusetts, Plymouth, Sagadahoc and the Province of Maine, were united in one, under the name of \" The Royal Province of Massachusetts Bay,\" and Sir William Phips was appointed its Governor by the King. Having an at tachment to his native region, Phips determined to defend it ; and during the season of 1692 he built a stone fort at Pemaquid. While this was in progress Church ascended the Penobscot to attack the Indian villages, but the savages retired from them before his arrival. Later, he ascended the Kenebec as far as Teconnet, having skirmishes with the savages at the latter place and near Swan Island. In the autumn, Iberville, the new French commander in Acadia, came to Pema quid with a body of French and Indians, but when he saw the strength of the new fort he retired without making an attack. In the following spring Captain Converse, of Maine, was put in command of three hun dred and fifty men. He built a stone fort at Saco, hunted the Indians of western Maine to the mountains, and in the other direction, scouted as far as Penobscot. Threatened by the Indians about the lakes, the French now withdrew their men to Canada ; and early in August, 1693, thirteen Sagamores, representing all the tribes from the Saco to the St. Croix, came to Pemaquid and made a treaty of peace. French influence, however, prevented them from fulfilling the conditions; and within a few weeks the war was in full tide again, in which the French now joined. In July, 1696, Iberville, with three ships of war, two companies of French soldiers, and two hundred and fifty Indians in canoes came against Pemaquid. He was now sup plied with mortars and heavy guns ; and the fort was finally obliged"], [52, "44 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. to capitulate. In the following month Church made an expedition to the B ly of Fundy (where the French were in power again), then as cenlsl the Penobscot; gaining nothing but a small spoil. The next year Major March was sent eastward with five hundred men, and had a fight with the Indians at Damariscotta. Peace having been made between England and France by the treaty of R/swick, a treaty was made with the Indians in 1699, at Mare (Sea) Poi it, in Brunswick. Tue war had lasted above ten years, and in that tin ! about four hundred and fifty English had fallen, and two hundred a a 1 fifty been carried into captivity. It was during the early part of this war that the witchcraft delusion prevailed in Massachusetts; but Miine did not fall under this affliction. Governor Phips died in Hi H. and was succeeded by the Earl of Bellamont, who also died in 1703, and was succeeded by Joseph Dud- Icy. Another war had now arisen between France and England, and Governor Dudley, to prevent the Indians from yielding to the influ ence of the French, met the tribes at Falmouth in June, 1703. He was attended by several members of the legislature, and a guard of soldiers ; and the chiefs were attended by large numbers of their warriors, in their paint and feathers. The most impressive assurances of good will and peaceful purpose were made by the Indians ; but before two months these same Indians with others fell suddenly upon the settle ments in western Maine. Their attack was unexpected, and resulted in great loss to the Eng lish, three settlements being utterly destroyed. The savages, however, were at several places repulsed with heavy loss ; and late in the season Captain March, with three hundred men, made an attack upon the In dians' stronghold at Pequaket (Fryeburg). Smaller parties also kept up the warfare on the enemy through the winter ; and in the spring Colonel Church was sent along the coast eastward with five hundred men in transports. Church captured whatever French people he found on the Penobscot and at Passamaquoddy Bay, but Port Royal proved too strong for him, and he returned with about one hundred prisoners and much spoil. This expedition frightened the Indians back to their fastnesses about the heads of the rivers, and freed the settlements from their attacks, but not from the fear of them. In the winter Captain Hilton with a force of two hundred and sev enty men was sent against Norridgewock ; but the Indians had notice of their coming and abandoned their village. Some other hostilities occurred during the winter, but rather to the advantage of the English ; and in the following summer an expedition consisting of a thousand men under Colonel March was sent against Acadia. It was unsuccess ful ; and the French rallied the Indians, and caused Maine to suffer in consequence. During the next two years hostilities continued, but without much damage to the English, other than keeping them from cultivating their lands. In the spring of 1710, a fleet with a regiment of marines arrived to assist in the conquest of Acadia. This was joined by one or more regiments from New England, and the whole force under General Nicholson soon had full possession of Acadia. Many of the chiefs now desired peace, but such was the vindictive feelings of the Indians, that they persisted in treacherous attacks upon the settlements. In 1713, the treaty of Utrecht closed the war between France and England, and j-oace with the savages soon followed."], [53, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 45 This was the second French and Indian war, called also Queen Anne's war. As soon as it was over there was a great rush of settlers to Maine, and many mills were built and thriving villages sprang up. The people were aware of the great influence exerted upon the natives by the French through the priests, \u2014 one of whom was new resident at each of the principal Indian villages. To offset this influence, the authorities of Massachusetts now sought to extend the Indian missions to Maine ; and in 1717 and later, ministers were provided for this pur pose at Fort George, in Brunswick, at Fort Halifax, on the Kennebec, at St. George's Fort, on the St. Georges River, and at Penobscot. In 1718 Governor Shute with his council met the tribes at Arrowsie ; and the latter promised to inquire into the injuries committed by their members upon the English settlers. Four young Indians were placed in the governor's hands as hostages, and by him taken to Boston and educated. Three years later 90 canoes of Indians bearing the French flag and accompanied by several Frenchmen, came to Sagadahoc, warning the settlers there that if they did not remove in three weeks, they and their property would be destroyed. In December a force under Colonel Westbrook was sent to Norridgewock to capture Rasle, who, it was found, had incited this demand. They reached the village, but before they could surround it Rasle had escaped to the woods. The warriors were mostly away on their winter hunt, but the English injured no one. In the spring the government sent gifts and peaceful messages to the tribes; yet in June, 1722, they commenced hostilities by destroying the settlement on Merrymeeting Bay, killing and making prisoners of nine families. At this time and in July, they also attacked the fort at St. Georges, but were repulsed. Their warriors now carried their hostilities over the entire settled portion of Maine, with varying fort tunes. In September 400 or 500 warriors, chiefly from St. Francis, in Canada, and Micmacs from Nova Scotia, made a sudden descent upon Arrowsie, destroying the houses and cattle, but failing to overcome the garrison. In September of the following year a force under Colonel West brook was sent against the Penobscot Indians ; but this, also, found their villages deserted. The next season there were no large movements on either side, the savages carrying on their warfare in a predatory manner. In the winter a third expedition under Captain Moulten was sent to Norridge wock for the capture of Rasle, but returned unsuccessful. On the St. Georges River, in May, 1724, aparty of 16 men in two whale-boats under Captain Winslow was surprised by 90 savages, and all were killed. In the summer another and final expedition was sent against Nor ridgewock. It was led by Captain Moulton, and consisted of two hun dred and eight men. This time the surprise of the Indians was com plete. After firing two or more volleys the Indians fled, and a large proportion of the warriors were shot as they attempted to escape. The French Missionary, Rasle, was also killed. After the English had set out on their return, a Mohawk, who had accompanied the English, turned back and set the village on fire. In the autumn following, Colonel Westbrook and Captain Heath were sent against the Indians east ward of the Kennebec ; but neither met with them or destroyed any of their villages. In April of the next year Captain Lovewell, with"], [54, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 46 forty-six volunteers, set out from Dunstable, in Massachusetts, to attack the Pequakets in their haunts about the head waters of the Saco River. At the margin of the beautiful sheet of water since known as Lov ell's Pond, they met a band of over a hundred warriors; upon which there ensued one of the most sanguinary fights on record. The contest lasted from about ten o'clock in the morning until dark, when the re maining savages retired, leaving the field to the English. Their loss was ten killed, fourteen wounded and one missing; while that of the Indians is supposed to have been about fifty. Some large pine trees about the margin of the pond had afforded the English much shelter from the bullets of the savages. The Indians were struck with such dread by this fight that they left their ancient location, and retired into some unknown quarter until the war was over. The tribes were now desirous of making peace, and in December following four of the Sag amores signed a treaty, which was fully ratified the next summer. _ By this treaty trading houses were to be kept by the English on the princi pal rivers for the convenience of the Indians, while all the English cap tives were to be returned without ransom. This war is known as \" Lovewell's War,\" or the \" Three Years War.\" The number killed and carried into captivity during its progress, including soldiers and seamen, was about two hundred. Soon after the close of this war the General Court laid out a tier of back towns, dividing them into lots ; and on these then settled many of the soldiers who had traversed the region during the wars. In these townships generally about sixty lots, of one hundred acres each, were surveyed, and were offered to as many actual settlers, on condi tion that actual possession should be taken within three years, to clear from five to eight acres fit for mowing and tillage; also to build a dwelling house at least eighteen feet square, and with seven feet posts. The settlers were also required collectively, within five or six years to build a meeting house, settle a good Protestant minister, and provide for his support. In these allotments there were usually reserved three lots for public uses, namely : the schools, the ministry, and one as a gift for the first settled minister. In the grants of the territoi-y of Maine and Sagadahoc all trees on crown lands of two feet in diameter at twelve inches from the ground were reserved for the use of the royal navy ; and any person felling trees of that size without license incurred a penalty of one hundred pounds. During the term of Governor Phips it was found that these trees were being appropriated by those who had no right to them ; and in 1699 John Bridges was appointed surveyor. His jurisdiction em braced the whole of New England, and he was assisted by four depu ties. So far as they could they went through the woods bordering on the sea coast and rivers and marked the best trees with the royal arrow. Yet the owners of mills in many cases did not hesitate to cut up even the trees thus marked, though the boards and planks generally showed the transgression by their width ; and there were many violent contests between the lumbermen and the King's Surveyors upon this matter. In 1729 Colonel David Dunbar was appointed as Keeper or Surveyor, and received also a grant of the territories between the Pen obscot and Kennebec under the name of the Province of Sagadahoc, the King reserving to himself within it three hundred thousand acres of the best pine and oak. The conditions of the grant were that Dun-"], [55, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 47 bar should settle the province with good, industrious Protestants. He did the country service in bringing many settlers of the Scotch-Irish into his territory ; while others of the same excellent people settled about Merrymeeting Bay, at Bath, and in the towns about Portland. By former patents, however, a large part of this territory belonged to other parties ; and after three years it was restored to the lawful owners. Samuel Waldo, who was one of these, had, soon after Lovewell's War, built mills, brought in a considerable number of Scotch-Irish, and about 1753, he sought and obtained a large number of Lutherans from Germany as settlers. George Whitefield, the Evangelist, first preached in Maine in 1741, and again visited the south-western part of the State in 1745. Rev. Samuel Moody, the most noted minister of his time in Maine, was settled over the church in York in 1700, remaining there until his death in 1747. In 1744 Spain joined with France in war against England, and as soon as the news reached America the French and Indians began to plot destruction for the English settlements again. The colonies had now greatly increased in strength, and early in the spring of 1745 an expe dition was sent against Louisburg, on Cape Breton ; this, next to Que bec, being far the strongest fortress in America. The armament con sisted of four thousand men and thirteen vessels, with transports and store ships, carrying in all about two hundred guns. The commander in-chief was William Pepperell,of Kittery, and the second in command was Samuel Waldo, of Falmouth. Of the force, also, was Lieutenant- Colonel William Vaughn, of Damariscotta, the originator of the enter prise ; and the commander of the fleet was Edward Tyng, of Falmouth. Mr. Whitefield gave the motto for the expedition of \" Nil Desperan dum, Christo duce.\" Near Louisburg they were joined by Commodore Warren with four British war ships; and during the siege six other ships arrived ; so that all told the fleet mounted some six hundred and ninety guns. The fortifications were all of stone, and immensely strong and effective against the small cannon of that period. After a siege of six weeks the fortress surrendered. For the merit of this service the King made Pepperell a baronet and Warren an admiral. Great efforts were made to keep the Indians from joining in the war, the authorities meeting them frequently, feasting them and making them gifts, even bestowing pensions upon some of the chiefs ; yet from the first there were some petty acts of malignity. The offending parties were supposed to be Androscoggin and Norridgewock Indians, and the Penobscots were solicited to furnish warriors to chas tise the offending parties, this being a stipulation in the last treaty with the tribes, made by Governor Dummer. Instead of complying, their next action was an attack in July, 1745, on the settlements between the Penobscot and Kennebec by a body of Cape Sable, St. John and St. Francis Indians. The demand was now made of the Penobscots and Norridgewocks that they should deliver up guilty in dividuals, or furnish thirty fighting men within fourteen days ; and they were informed that by failure to comply the treaty would be broken. There was no response, and on the 23d of August the govern ment declared war against the tribes who had joined in the treaty. In order to ensure the efficiency of the force sent against the savages, bounties were offered for each Indian captured cr killed, the proof of"], [56, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 48 the latter being his scalp. Scouting parties of English were now con stantly out, but met few Indians ; yet unprotected or unwary settlers continued to be killed or captured, and buildings to be burned among all the settlements until winter. The next spring the garrisons of Maine were increased by 500 men, for the country was swarming with savages. This continued until the summer of 1751, when a new treaty was made. Yet there were soon indications that the peace would not be of long continuance, and in 1754 a fortification named Fort Halifax was built on the east side of the Kennebec, at the junction with the Sebas ticook, opposite Waterville. Encouraged by this, the proprietors of the Plymouth Patent ou the river also built a fort at Cushnoc named Fort Western, and another in Dresden, about a mile above Swan Island, both on the eastern side of the Kennebec. The latter was named Fort Shirley, in honor of the governor. Just as Fort Halifax was at the point of completion an attack was made upon the workmen. The fort was immediately strengthened with guns and a garrison of 100 men, and no further attack was made for some time. During 1755 an expedition of 2,000 men, part of whom were from Maine, were sent to drive the French from Acadia. The movement was demanded by the English governor, Lawrence, and the force, when it arrived, was placed under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Monkton, who added to it his own force of about 270 regulars and a small train of artillery. The expedition set out in May, and before the 1st of September every stronghold in Acadia was in possession of the English. There were in the present Nova Scotia and vicinity about 18,000 inhabitants of French extraction, who, though by the treaties between France and England considered as neutrals, were yet indissolubly attached to the nation from which they sprung. They took no part in the wars, but they secretly afforded aid, harbor and recruits to the enemy; and the resident authorities demanded that those about the Basin of Minas and in Cumberland County adjoin ing should be removed. Accordingly, nearly 2,000 of them were transported to the western coast, and scattered among the settlements from Maine to Florida. In Cumberland the inhabitants generally dis obeyed the summons, and evaded the troops, \u2014 by whom their houses and crops were burned. The families mostly fled to the St. John's river, where they remained undisturbed until the Revolution ; when. espousing the American side, the advent of a British force caused them to retire up the river to the vicinity known as the \" Madawaska Settle ments.\" Meanwhile the Indians were so active in their movements in Maine that there was scarcely a town where houses were not burned, and men, women and children killed, or carried into captivity, though par ties of the whites were constantly scouting between their settlements and those of the red men. But when the fall of' Acadia became known to them, they retired in alarm to the northern wilds. The Tarratines, or Penobscot Indians, however, had remained neutral through the war ; yet a party raised by a Captain Cargill, finding no Indians else where, fired on a group of them near Owl's Head on the Penobscot, without stopping to learn whether they were neutrals or hostiles. For this offense Cargill was arrested and kept in prison two years, when, as no Indian appeared against him, he was released. The authorities did"], [57, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 49 what they could to make amends to the tribe by messages of regret and gifts to the relatives of the slain Indians. Depredations by members of other tribes still continued, but the Penobscots still refused to take up arms against these, and government therefore, in November, 1775, declared war against them. Three hun dred men were raised in the following March to act as scouting parties, and during the season the garrisons were strengthened. The savages were on the war-path by the last of March, and from that time to the close of the season they ranged destructively through all the settled portions of the State, being rarely met by the scouts; and many of the new plantations were abandoned. The limits of the settlements which maintained themselves through this war are marked by New Gloucester on the north-west, Fort Halifax on the north, and Thomaston on the north-east. The following year was a repetition of the last, with but little variation. So many men were required in Acadia and at Louis burg, and in the operations against the French and Indians about Lake Champlain and on the Ohio, that no large number could be put in the field in Maine. In 1758, the capture of Louisburg from the French a second time, and the fall of Fort Du Quesne, at Pittsburg, on the Ohio, revived the spirits of the people. Six hundred soldiers from Maine took honorable part in the capture of Louisburg, while 300 had been raised for the defence of the settlements at home. In August, the fort at St. George's was attacked by 400 French and Indians. A timely rein forcement secured their repulse, and they turned southward and attacked the fort at Meduncook, now Friendship. Here they killed or captured eight men, but failed to take the fort. It was the last notable attack of the Indians upon the English settlements, and with this sea son the outrages and massacres by the tribes of Maine forever ceased. In 1759, Governor Thomas Pownal, who had succeeded Shirley, constructed a fort on the Penobscot, on the Western side of the river in what is now the town of Prospect. While the siege of Quebec was in progress, Colonel Rogers with two hundred rangers was sent from Ticonderoga to destroythe Indian villages about the St. Francis river, just northwest of Maine ; and his mission was successfully performed. In September, Quebec surrendered to the English, and the next year the dominion of the French in the north was finally overthrown. The population of Maine in 1742, was twelve thousand, and the towns and plantations were about twenty-five. In 1760, Lincoln and Cumberland counties w-ere formed,\u2014 the former then including all the country northward of the Androscoggin and eastward to the St. CroiT. The first English settlements east of the Penobscot were made shortly before 1762. In this year twelve townships lying eastward of that river were granted to several hundred petitioners, a few of whom had already settled there. One lot in each township was reserved for a church, another for the first minister settled, a third for Harvard College, and a fourth for the use of schools. About this time the British government began to bear more heavily upon the resources of the colonies, in the attempt to gain a revenue from America. Not content with enriching her merchants and manufacturers by the \"Acts of Trade,\" by which various manufactures, including those of iron and steel, were prohibited in the colonies, they increased the import tax on molasses and sugar. Then in 1765 the Stamp Act was devised,"], [58, "50 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. by which all papers for ships, transfers of property, college diplomas, marriage licenses, and newspapers must be made on stamped paper, which was supplied at a high price by the government. Failing to execute this act, it was repealed in the following year ; but only to be succeeded by another act equally obnoxious and subversive of the charter rights of the colonists, and of their rights as Englishmen. The new act laid an import tax greatly larger than was necessary to pay the expenses of the customs service on all paper, glass, colors and teas brought into the country. This tax was opposed by non-consumption and non-importation agreements; and as the English merchants at length found their business falling off on this account, they strenuously petitioned Parliament for the repeal of the law. In 1768, seven hun dred British soldiers had arrived in Boston to enforce the iniquitous law, and between these and the citizens a feeling of hostility grew up until it culminated, in the Boston massacre in March, 1770. It was no doubt partly the alarm caused by this occurrence that influenced the repeal ; which was done in 1770, with the exception of the tax on tea. Yet this very repeal, though it lessened the sum of the tax, re-asserted the principle that Parliament had a right to tax the American Colonies without their having a representation in that body. Meanwhile by means of newspapers, orations and pamphlets, patriots like Samuel and John Adams, with Otis and Mayhew, in Boston, Livingston, in New York, and Gadsden, in South Carolina, instructed the people in their rights and stimulated the spirit of liberty'. The first act of resistance in Maine connected with the Revolution arose from the seizure of the schooner of Mr. Tyng by the comptroller of customs for a breach of the revenue laws. The crew opposed the King's officers, and the citizens quickly gathered, when the officers were handled pretty roughly, and the vessel set free. In December, 1773, the Bostonians poured into their harbor the tea which was being forced upon them. The consequence of this act was the passing by Parliament of the \"Boston Port Bill,\" which closed that port to all commerce from the first of June, 1774. In sympathy with the afflicted city, the bells of Portland (then Falmouth) tolled all that day. On the 17th General Gage dis solved the General Court, but they had already chosen delegates to a Congress of the colonies of Philadelphia. The people of Massachusetts and Maine soon after chose representatives who met at Salem in Oc tober, and formed themselves into a Provincial Congress. In this Congress, as in the General Court, Maine had three representatives. This body elected a committee of safety, a committee of supplies, chose five delegates to represent Maine and Massachusetts in the new Con tinental Congress, and made laws for the formation and drill of military companies in every town. In March, 1775, the British sloop-of-war, Canseau, Captain Mowatt, came to Portland to aid in enforcing the several laws. Mowatt soon after sailed for Penobscot, where he \"removed the guns and ammunition. The next month occurred the battles of Lexington and Concord. The next day after the news arrived at York a company was formed, and by night it had reached New Hampshire, on the way to Boston. Three days later, Faimouth sent a company; and shortly after Colonel Scammon, of Saco, reached Cambridge with a regiment. New Glou cester sent twenty men, paying their wages and supporting their families during their absence. The inhabitants eastward wereltoo re-"], [59, "THE BATTLE OF LEXINGTON, APRIL 19, 1776."], [60, "52 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. mote and scattered to furnish any more soldiers than were necessary to protect their own exposed borders. When the news of the Lexington fight reached Bath, the citizens immediately seized the King's dock and the naval agent in that place. A few days later, Lieutenant Colonel Thompson of Brunswick learned that the Causeau was again at Portland ; and raising a company of volunteers he crossed the bay and seized Captain Mowatt as he walked out after dinner. His lieutenant then threatened to bombard the town unless the captain was released ; and on Mowatt' s promising to come on shore the next morning, he was permitted to go on board his vessel. Instead of returning, however, he sailed away to other parts. On the 17th of June the battle of Bunker Hill was fought, in which participated Colonel Scammon's regiment, and some others from Maine. The news of the battle of Lexington reached Machias early in May. The inhabitants soon set up a tall Liberty pole in the village. About this time the British armed sloop, Margaretta, came into port as convoy to a sloop which was to take a cargo of lumber for the use of the army in Boston. Her commander, Lieutenant Moore, ordered the Liberty pole to be taken down, threatening bombardment if the order was not complied with. The citizens held a meeting and voted not to take down the pole. The meeting was held on Saturday, and on Sunday an attempt was made to seize Lieutenant Moore while at church, but he escaped to his vessel. Early the next morning a party of men armed with guns, pitchforks and axes took possession of two wood sloops lying at the wharf and set out in pursuit of the Margaretta, which had fallen down river. In a few hours, after a sanguinary engage ment, the Margaretta was captured. This was the first vessel captured in the Revolution ; and the affair has been generally designated as the \" Lexington of the Sea.\" Captain Mowatt, who had broken his parole at Portland, leaving his sureties to make good his defection, came again in October, \u2014 the Canseau being accompanied by three other armed vessels. He soon made known that his errand and purpose was to bombard and destroy the city, giving the inhabitants only two hours to escape. On being expostulated with by leading citizens, he agreed to postpone the bombardment until morning, in return for the surrender of eight stands of muskets. He further proposed that if they would deliver him these and four pieces of cannon, with what ammunition they had, he would delay the bombardment until he could hear from the admiral at Boston. The delay until morning appeared a necessity ; and the eight stands of small arms were delivered ; but they declined to give up the cannon. All the teams which could be procured were at once set at work removing the goods of the inhabitants into the country ; but quantities remained unmoved, so brief was the time. At the solicitation of tho citizens' committee he postponed the bombardment thirty minutes only. Promptly when the time was up, the guns began to play upon the village ; and at length, under cover of the fire, armed parties came from the ships and applied the torch to the buildings. Some citizens w-ith devoted courage followed them, extinguishing the fires at the risk of their lives. When the assault ceased, there remained of the largest village in Maine only about 100 houses scattered over the i>eninsula."], [61, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 53 Arnold's expedition against Quebec by way of the Kennebeo occurred in the autumn of 1775. It consisted of about 1,100 men, including three companies of riflemen under Captain Morgan, from Pennsylvania and Virginia, and ten companies of musketry from Maine and Massachusetts. The expedition sailed from Newburyport on the 18th of September, disembarking at Pittston, from whence the voyage was made in 200 batteaux to tho Great Carrying Place, twelve miles below the Forks of the Kennebec. A part of the boats belonging to the first division, led by Arnold in person, were drawn by oxen across the carry of fourteen miles to Dead River. During a severe storm their encampment was suddenly flooded, and seven boats upset, by which the stores they contained were lost. They had but twelve days provisions left, while there were still thirty miles between them and the head waters of Chaudiere, and the French settlements where first they would find provisions, were seventy miles further. The sick were now sent back to Colonel Enos, who was in the rear with the second division of the army ; his orders being to forward the invalids to the settlements, and to follow the advance with fifteen days provis ions. He had but three days provisions ; so instead of going back for supplies, he abandoned the expedition. The rain which had flooded' Arnold's camp was quickly succeeded by snow and ice. They reached a small tributary of the Chaudiere on the 27th of October. In making the voyage down the river, they lost several boats, and came near per ishing by starvation. Their attack upon Quebec was necessarily delayed too long, and failed of success. What remained of the force finally found its way back to the States by way of New York, where several months later, they shared in the movements preceding the cap ture of Burgoyne's army. Before the close of 1775, the Continental Congress had established' a General Post Office and put it in operation from Georgia to Maine ; Samuel Freeman, of Falmouth (Portland), being the first postmaster in Maine. During the latter part of this year every department of the Provincial Government of Massachusetts which had been susceptible of revolution w-as given system, form and permanency. New judges and officers of the Courts were appointed, and the militia was arranged' anew, Maine forming one of its four divisions. At its session, in May, 1776, the Provincial Congress enacted that after the first day of June all eivil and military commissions, all writs, precepts and recognizances should be \" In the name of the Government ar.d People of Massachu setts Bay in New England,\" and bear date in the year of the Christian era, without any mention of the British Sovereign. The oath of office was also changed to accord with the enactment. This is the true date of the declaration of the independence of Massachusetts. On the 4th of July, 1776, the Continental Congress declared the thirteen United Colonies to be free and independent. In Maine the ministers read' the declaration to their people, and the town clerks entered it at full1 length in their records. The people of the colonies no longer consisted of two political parties, one of which was in rebellion, \u2014 but of British subjects or Tories, and of the American nation struggling against a for eign nation. The people of Maine apprehended their different status, and acquired fresh spirit. The town of Machias, on the very confines of the Union, nobly undertook to aid the people of the St. John's river, and of Chignecto"], [62, "54 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. and Cumberland counties, in New Brunswick, to obtain freedom ; and for nearly a year the contest was kept up. Finally, the British re covered the St. John's and all the country east thereof ; but the noble Colonel John Allan, by great self-sacrifice, succeeded in retaining the attachment of the Penobscot and Passamaqouddy tribes of Indians, and by their means, held the territory as far as the St. Croix for the American Union. In 1777, Machias was made a national military station, and supplied with a garrison of three hundred men under Colonel Allan. Fort Pownal on the Penobscot was also garrisoned by thirty men, ten of whom were Indians. A British force was soon after sent to visit with desolation this spirited section of the country. In August, before the garrison was collected together, a small British force consisting of a sloop, two frigates and a brig entered Machias River and made an attack upon the town. They succeeded in burn ing a tide-mill and taking a coasting sloop, then sent several barges laden with soldiers up the west branch to effect further destruction. But the inhabitants had gathered in answer to the alarm, and the British were driven from the river with much loss. The Continental currency had now fallen in value until it required .thirty dollars in bills to equal one in specie. In 1778 the Hon. John .Adams was appointed ambassador lo the French Court. He was \u2022conveyed to France by the frigate Boston, commanded by Samuel Tucker, afterward a citizen of Bremen, in this State. Captain Tucker iis said to have captured during the Revolutionary War, more of the enemy's vessels than any other commander. On this voyage he was chased by three armed vessels of the British, who were on the watch to capture the ambassador, but they failed. Later in the voyage, Captain Tucker captured an armed brig of the British. Mr. Adams's mission was followed by the sending of a French fleet under Count d'Estaing to aid the American cause. Early in June, 1779, the British General McLane with a force of seven or eight vessels and nine hundred men came to Penobscot and took possession of Castine, building a strong fort there. At the last of July they were besieged by a fleet under Commodore Salstonstall, of Connecticut, and about one thousand Maine and Massachusetts mil itia under General Lovell, of the latter State , and General Wadsworth, of Maine. The operations of the militia were brilliant and would have been successful but for the over caution of the fleet, by which the final assault was delayed until a strong British force from Halifax entered she bay, when the Salstonstall fleet scattered, and were mostly burned or captured ; while the army was obliged to abandon the siege, and make its way through the wilderness to the Kennebec. The British held the Penobscot until the close of the war ; but Machias remained unsubdued ; and the treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States, signed in September, 1783, placed our boundary at the St. Croix, instead of at the Penobscot. The first newspaper published in Maine was the Falmouth Gazette, the first number being issued on New Year's day, 1785. In 1786, a large quantity of the public land in Maine was disposed of by lottery ; William Bingham, of Philadelphia, by purchase of tickets and of prizes, becoming the possessor of extensive tracts in eastern Maine, \u2014 he having purchased also about 1,000,000 acres in what are now the counties of Piscataquis, Somerset and Franklin. In 1790 a census of Maine under Federal authority showed it to have a population of 00,000."], [63, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 55 In the settlement of lands in several portions of the State much con fusion of title had arisen from overlapping patents and incorrect surveys. Especially was this the case on the eastern side of the Kennebec above Merrymeeting Bay,and between the Kennebec and Androscoggin Rivers. A large part of the business of the courts for several years preeeding[1809 arose from disputes in relation to land titles. The \" Betterment Act \" passed by the Masachusetts Legislature in 1808, at length settled these difficulties. Yet in the next year, some miles east of the Augusta, a surveyor was shot by a band of disguised settlers ; and these having been arrested on a charge of murder, an armed band made a feeble attempt to rescue them; on which occasion several companies of militia were called out. The trial did not show which of the persons on trial committed the murder, and all were discharged. This affair was derisively called the \" Malta War.\" The effect of the trial upoii this class of disputes was excellent ; and reverence to law and the consequent peace of the community was greatly enhanced by it. The United States being still young and weak, France and England, \u2014 at this period intensely hostile in their measures against each other paid little attention to American rights on the sea, and their action was exceedingly injurious to American commerce. To induce them to recall their offensive edicts, in 1808 an embargo was laid upon our ports by Congress. This was regarded as useless by many of the people ; and after fourteen months it was superseded by the \" Non intercourse Act.\" This prohibited commerce with France and England only, but France having rescinded all obnoxious edicts, the act ceased on November 2, to have effect against that power. England still con tinuing her oppressive measures, Congress, in April, 1812, laid another embargo for ninety days upon all vessels in our ports. This was followed in June by a declaration of war against Great Britain. General Henry Dearborn, a citizen of Maine, was made commander in-chief of the National army, and Congress called upon the States for 100,000 men of which Maine's quota was 2,500. The population of Maine by the census of 1810 was 228,000, while her exports in the preeceding year amounted to $803,619, and the aggregate of her shipping, though it had fallen off, was still 141,057 tons. In June, 1812 six banks were incorporated in Maine; and on the same day the General Court laid a tax upon these new corpora tions. When they commenced business, the banking capital of Maine was $1,620,000, which paid into the treasury annually a tax of $10,200. The first notable affair in this war within the limits of our State was the battle of the American brig Enterprise and the British brig Boxer, near the mouth of the Kennebec, on September 5, 1813. The Boxer carried eighteen guns and one hundred and four men, while the Enterprise carried sixteen guns and one hundred and two men. The battle lasted but thirty-five minutes, when the Boxer struck her colors ; having lost forty-six men killed and wounded, while the loss of the Enterprise was but fourteen. Both commanders, Blythe of the Boxer, and Burrows of the Enterprise, fell early in the action. On the 11th of July, 1814, a British force appeared before Eastport. The garrison and fortification were evidently insufficient to withstand the enemy ; and at the solicitation of the citizens, the commander, Major Perley Putnam, surrendered the place. A strong body of the"], [64, "56 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. British soon after marched to Robbinston. The garrison consisted of but twenty-five men under Lieutenant Manning ; who, seeing the hopelessness of defense, destroyed his stores and retired to Machias. During the summer detached vessels of this fleet cruised off the coast ; and several of our privateers were successful in capturing their supply vessels. On September 1, the garrison and inhabitants at the little village of Castine discovered a British fleet in the bay bearing toward their port. Any show of resistance would have been folly, and the place was soon in possession of the enemy. The armament was under the chief command of Sir John Sherbrook, and consisted of the seventy-four gun ships Dragon, Spenser and Bulwark, the frigates Bacchante and Tenedos, the sloops Sylph arid Peruvian, the schooner Pictu, a large tender, and ten transports; on board these were about four thousand troops, under the command of General Gerard Gosselin. On the afternoon of the same day, General Gosselin with two vessels and six hundred men crossed the bay and took possession of Belfast ; while Captain Barrie in the Dragon, accompanied by the Sylph and Peruvian, with a small schooner as tender, and having on board about seven hundred troops, ascended the river to Marsh Bay. In the morning five or six hundred troops landed and took possession of Frankfort ; whence they marched up river toward Hampden. The alarm had been sounded through the neighboring towns, and the militia rallied to the defense of the village. An excellent plan of defense was formed, but when the guns from the British ships began to play upon them, and the steady column of regulars advanced upon their attenuated line, the militia gave way in a panic ; and the place was lost. Without delay, the vessels and troops proceeded up the river to Bangor. No resistance was made here, but the enemy plundered both public and private property ; and 191 of the citizens were com pelled to report themselves as prisoners of war. Fourteen vessels were burned and four carried away. There were also four vessels upon th\u00a9 stocks, which, if burned, would probably have involved the village in a conflagration. To avert this disaster, the selectmen of the town were obliged to give a bond of $30,000 to deliver the vessels at Cas tine in the next month. On their return, the enemy again subjected Hampden to pillage ; taking away with them two merchant vessels with valuable cargoes, and much other spoil. A squadron now set out for Machias, which was garrisoned at this time by about 100 men, including the militia and Lieutenant Manning's company from Robinston. After landing the troops at Buck's Harbor, the vessels ascended the river and opened a heavy fire on the fort, covering the advance of the land force, which was to make an attack in the rear. Finding that they were likely to be surrounded, the garri son destroyed the guns, set the barracks on fire, and retreated through the country to Belfast. An attempt was now made to bring the people of the district between Penobscot and Passamaquoddy into entire subjection to the British crown. All males above sixteen years of age were requiried to take the oath of allegiance ; General Gosselin was made governor of the new province, and Castine was made its port of entry. Yet the town sent its representative as usual to the General Court ; and the town records show no action produced by the British occupation."], [65, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 57 On December 24th, 1814, a treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States was signed at Ghent ; but Castine was not evac uated until the following April. The winter of 1816-17 was unusually severe, the succeeding spring backward, and the summer cold, \u2014 which was very discouraging to all the people ; and there was a great furor for emigrating to Ohio, which was then offering favorable conditions to settlers. It is estimated that Maine lost by this emigration about 15,000 inhabitants. In 1820, Maine had nine counties and 236 towns ; while its popu lation was 298,335, \u2014 an increase of about 70,000 in ten years. In 1819, seventy towns joined in a petition to the General Court for the separ ation of the district from Massach assets; and the Court passed a bill to forward the measure. Its conditions were that all the public lands and buildings in Maine, except such as were the property of the United States, should be divided equally between the proposed State and Massachusetts. Maine was also to have her proportion of the military stock, and one-third of all moneys which might be reimbursed by the general government for war expenses. On the fourth Monday of July, 1819, the citizens of the District of Maine voted on this question of separation ; and on counting the votes, above two-thirds were found to be in its favor. Therefore delegates from the towns met at the court house in Portland on the second Monday in October, and adopted a constitution ; appointing the first Monday in September as the day for the towns to vote for or against this constitution. On the first Wed nesday of January, 1820 the delegates again met, and finding the instru ment to have been adopted, made application to Congress for ad mission to the Union. The struggle between the slave power and the party of freedom had already begun in Congress. Missouri, a slave territory, was an applicant for admission to the Union, like Maine. A large number of the people and of their representatives felt that it was time to take a stand against slavery. The party of freedom insisted upon the right and duty of Congress to make Missouri a free State; the party of slavery was equally urgent that Congress had no right to interfere. There was also an argument from the members of the two classes of States ; the Union now consisting of twenty-two States, eleven free and eleven slaveholding. Therefore the partisans of slavery sought to join Maine in the same bill with Missouri, and thus overcome the opposition of the Houseof Representatives to the admission of the latter as a slave State. After a long and violent struggle the Missouri compromise was adopted, and Missouri admitted as a slave State ; then Maine was admitted without opposition. In the election for State officers, General William King of Bath was chosen almost unanimously. In 1831 Augusta was made the State capital instead of Portland ; the first session in Augusta being held in 1830. The current of State affairs went on smoothly until 1837. The settlements on the St. John's near the mouth of the Madawaska River were claimed both by the United States and by Great Britain. In June of that year an agent of the government while taking a census of the Madawaska settlements was arrested by a British constable, and taken to Fredericton, on a charge of exciting sedition. The agent had acted with entire propriety ; and the British authorities simply meant to show that Maine would no longer be permitted to exercise authority in that region. The claim of"], [66, "58 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Great Britain extended southward nearly to the forty-sixth degree of latitude ; which, if allowed, would rob Maine of about one-third of her territory. Governor Dunlap of Maine immediately issued a general order declaring the State to be invaded by a foreign power, and notifying the militia to hold themselves in readiness for military service. But as no other act of hostility occurred, and the agent was set at liberty, the excitement in regard to the boundary was allayed for the time. In 1838 was completed the first geological survey of Maine by Dr. Ezekiel Holmes and Dr. Charles T. Jackson. Early in 1839, a deputy of the land agent of Maine reported that a large number of lumbermen from New Brunswick were robbing the disputed territory about Aroostook River of its best timber ; whereupon Sheriff Strickland of Penobscot County was i rdered to dislodge the trespassers. He went to Aroostook with a posse of about 200 men ; the trespassers retiring before him into New Brunswick. At Woodstock they broke into the government arsenal and armed themselves, then turned to meet the sheriff. They captured the Maine land agent, and Strickland, seeing that a meeting of these forces would be likely to lead to much bloodshed, if not to a general war, set out for Augusta, and laid the matter before the governor. Very soon after, the proclamation of Governor Harvey arrived, which declared British territory invaded, and asserted his purpose to repel the invasion by force. The Legislature immediately appropriated $800,000 to defend the public lands, and the governor called out 10,000 militia. When the messenger from Maine laid the facts befoie the National House of Representatives, that body appropriated $10,000,000 to meet the probable expense, and authorized the President, in case Governor Harvey persisted in his purpose of maintaining exclusive jurisdiction, to raise 50,000 vol unteers for a term of six months. On the 6th of March, General Scott and his staff arrived in Augusta, and opened communications with Governor Harvey. The matter was now soon settled on the basis of a withdrawal of the troops of both parties, and the protection of the lumber of the region by a civil posse of Maine. The question of boundary was finally settled in 1842, by Lord Ashburton, the British ambassador and Daniel Webster, American Secretary of State, to gether with the commissioners appointed by Maine. The State also in due time received $200,000 from the national government as re imbursement for the expenses she had incurred in defending the integrity of American territory. MAINE IN THE WAR OF THE REBELLION. When the first gun of the slaveholders' rebellion was fired upon Fort Sumpter, Israel Washburn, jun., was governor of Maine; and no one could have pressed the preparations for the defense of the Union more energetically or efficiently than did he. The towns, too, were as prompt in their action as the State authorities. In many, full companies of volunteers were ready to march within twenty-four hours after the tidings were received. The Lewiston Light Infantrv was the first company accepted by the governor. Cherryfield enlisted \"fifty volunteers within four hours after the roll was opened. Mr Henry B. Humphrey,"], [67, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 59 of Thomaston, offered to devote $15,000 to the arming and equipping of a company of artillery. Maine had an enrolled Militia of about 60,000 men, but they were un armed and unorganized to the degree that there were only about 1,200 men in any condition to respond to a call of military duty. At the first call of the President of the United States for 75,000 volunteers, on the 15th of April, 1861, Maine promptly sent her First and Second regiments of infantry so thoroughly armed and equipped as to elicit the commendation of the Secretary of War. On the arrival of the first call of the President for troops, Governor Washburn found himself without authority of law to meet the emer gency ; and he therefore immediately convened the Legislature. That body met on the 22d of April, and passed an act for the raising of ten regiments of volunteers to serve two years, unless sooner discharged ; and it authorized a loan of $1,000,000. Ten regiments were ac cordingly called for by the Governor. The First regiment was must ered into the service of the United States for three months, the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth, for two years. Subsequent orders from the War Department required all State volunteers to be mustered into service for three years, which made it necessary to contract for an additional year's service with all these regiments except the First and Second. In the first battle of Bull Run, about one-fourth of the troops actually engaged on the loyal side were from Maine. The battle in- duced the completion at once of enlistments for the remaining four of the six regiments. Still more troops being found necessary, authority was given by the War Department for the organization of five more regiments of infantry (with power to increase to eight), a regiment of cavalry, six batteries of light artillery, and a company of rifle sharp- shooters. Thus, up to the beginning of the year 1862, Maine had raised and organized for service fifteen regiments of infantry, one regi- ment of cavalry, six batteries of mounted artillery, one company of sharpshooters, and four companies of coast guards. From April 3, 1862, to May 21, the volunteer recruiting ser- geants ceased from their work ; but at the latter date the War De- partment authorized the raising of the Sixteenth regiment of infantry for three years' service. Within a few weeks a requisition was made upon the State for its quota upon the call of July 2, for 300,000 vol- unteers for three years' service under the General Government. The Sixteenth regiment previously authorized, was admitted with the Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth, and numerous recruits for regiments in the field, to satisfy this call. Before the organization of all these was completed, the President, on the 4th of August, called for 300,000 militia to be raised by draft, and to serve nine months, unless sooner discharged. The quota of Maine under this call was 9,609 ; a small deduction from which was authorized on account of the large number of our enrolled militia who were in the merchant marine and in the navy, with the privilege of furnishing vol unteers instead of drafted men for the whole or any portion of that number. Regulations for enrolment and draft under the requisition were issued by the War Department on the 9th of August, in general orders, which directed the designation of rendezvous for the troops"], [68, "60 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. and commandants of the encampments, and also required the enrol ment of all able-bodied male citizens between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, the appointment of a commission from each county to supervise the drafting, and hear and determine the excuses of persons claiming exemption from military duty, \u2014 in case no provision was made by State law for carrying into effect the draft ordered, or if such provisions were defective. Our statutes being deemed sufficient, no commissioners were then appointed ; but the other requirements of the War Department were complied with. Portland, Augusta and Bangor were appointed the places of rendezvous for the troops. At the close of October, it being found that a few towns were remiss in furnishing the balance of their quotas upon calls of July and August, a general order was issued, appointing a commission for each county to make a draft on the 29th of November, in such towns as should not by that time enlist the required number of soldiers. Stimulated by the commissioners, the towns filled their quotas, and no draft was made under this order. In the year following (1863), tho draft was enforced by the General Government under the conscription law. The total result of the draft of this year was as follows : \u2014 Drafted and entered service, 808 ; fur nished substitutes, 1,737; exempted, failed to report, etc., 11,605. Tctal, 16,087. The only flagrant instance of opposition occurred in the town of Kingfield ; and this was promptly suppressed by the State militia. Following this draft, another call was made by the President on October 17, for 300,000 volunteers. Pending the draft under direction of the War Department, Governor Coburn received per mission to raise the Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth regiments of infantry, Second regimen^ of cavalry, and the Seventh battery of artillery, which were designated veteran volunteers. These troops were raised during the fall and winter, and promptly forwarded to the seat of war. In addi tion to these corps, recruiting for regiments in the service still continued. Under Governor Cony's administration, six companies of cavalry were raised under the Presidential call of February 2, 1864, for Baker's District of Columbia cavalry; also, the Thirty-first and Thirty-second regiments of infantry. The rebel invasion of Maryland and the Dis trict of Columbia, cutting off communication with Washington, in duced Governor Cony to issue a proclamation containing a call for volunteer troops for driving back the enemy. A general response was made to this call all over the State ; but action upon it ceased as the danger speedily passed. The aggregate number of men furnished by Maine up to July 1st, 1864, exclusive of enlistments in the navy, and a greater part of those in the regular army, is .53,281. This includes 7,585 nine-months men, which, reduced to three years men, gives us a credit on their account of 1,896; and also 700 three-months men, \u2014 so that the whole number of three years men, with which the War Department credited the State, is only 46,812. But this \u2014 according to the figures of the De partment \u2014 gives the State an excess of 617 over all calls. Under the act of Congress authorizing credits for enrolled men in the naval ser vice, it was found that Maine was entitled to credit for 3,436 men. On the 19th of December, 1864, the President issued a call for 300,000 additional men to be enforced by a draft after February 15, 1865. The quota of the State under this call was 8,389."], [69, "THE STATE OF MAINE. 61 Until July 2, 1862, no quotas were assigned to the State. The quota under the President's call of that date was 9,609 ; and under the next call (August 4), which was for nine-months men, the quota was the same. The quota for the call of February 1, 1864, for 500,000 men (which included the draft and call of October 17, 1863), was 11,803. The quota for the call of March 14, 1864, for 200,000 men was 4,721. The absorption of the most efficient of the active militia of the State into the United States service, led to the organization of numer ous companies of home guards, several of which, in view of the dep redations of the rebel privateers, garrisoned the principal forts on our coast. The almost successful scheme of the rebels for capturing the United States Revenue cutter, Caleb Cushing, in Portland harbor, June 26, 1863, demonstrated the necessity of greater vigilance and better preparations for the defense of the seaboard. There were also attempted raids on Calais and Castine. Additional companies of coast guards were therefore authorized, \u2014 making, in all, seven com panies which were raised in the State during the year, and mustered into the United States service. Two of these companies were ordered out of the State, and assigned to guard duty in the defences of Wash ington. At the request of the governor, the efficiency of the coast defences of the State was increased by the National Government. Strong field works were erected, heavy ordnance mounted, and suitable ammunition and projectiles deposited in their magazines. Forts Mc- Clary (Kittery), Gorges, Preble and Scammel (Portland), Popham and Knox (entrance of Kennebec and Penobscot Rivers) and Sullivan (Eastport), were each placed in a suitable condition for defence; while at Rockland, Belfast, Castine, Machiasport, Calais and Lubec effective batteries were erected. Maine rallied at the nation's first cry of need, and through the war she bore an honorable and conspicuous part. One of her gallant sons, Major General Berry, was the first volunteer officer of his grade to fall in battle at the head of his column ; one of her regiments was the first to bear back the old flag to the soil of South Carolina. Another of her Major Generals, Chamberlain, conspicuous in several battles for his heroism and cool judgment, held the post of honor at the sur render of the rebel General Lee and his army. THE SWEDISH EMIGRATION. The subject of Swedish emigration to populate our wild lands was first officially proposed by Governor Washburne in his message to the legislature in 1861. The troubles of the war diverted attention from it until 1869, when commissioners appointed by the Legislature explored Aroostook County, and in 1870, reported in favor of establishing a Swedish colony in Maine. Accordingly Hon. William W. Thomas, Jr., who had previously resided in that country three years as United States Consul, was appointed a commissioner to visit Sweden and ob tain twenty-five families. None were to be received but honest and industrious farmers and laborers with their families. He was entirely successful in his mission ; and on July 23, 1870, the emigrants reached their new home, \u2014 which they have named \" New Sweden.\" It is the first township on the east of range fifteen, in Aroostook county ; and"], [70, "62 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. there is said to be no better township in the State. The colony brought by Mr. Thomas consisted of twenty-two men, eleven women and eigh teen children ; and after paying for their transportation to New Swe den at a cost of $4,000, they had a remaining $3,000 in cash, and six tons of baggage. On the 14 of September, twelve additional emigrants arrived; and on the 31st of October twenty more followed, direct from Sweden; so that in December, 1870, five months after the arrival of the first installment, the colony consisted of 114. It is believed that many more of this hardy, moral, industrious and intelligent people will follow, to subdue our northern wilderness and add to the pros perity and happiness of our State. With this scene of peace aud promise we lay down the scroll of history,"], [71, "A GAZETTEER OF THE STATE OF MAINE. AuDOt is situated in the south-western part of Piscataquis County. It is bounded in the north by Monson, east by Guilford, south by Parkman and west by Kingsbury. The area of the town is 23,040 acres. Piper and Greenleaf are the principal ponds, \u2014 the first two miles in length and half a mile in width. The soil is superior, being largely alluvial ; and there is more interval than is found in any other town on the river above Dover. The principal rock is limestone. It is the most western of the Bowdoin College townships, granted in 1794 by the General Court, and was sold to settlers by the College treasurer and his agents. The first settler was Abraham Moore, who exchanged his farm in Norridgewood for 800 acres of wild laud, in four lots of 200 acres each. He felled the trees of the first opening in 1805, in 1806 raised a crop and built a log-house, and in 1807 moved his family in. In 1808, Peter Brown and Eaton Richards moved in with their families. In 1810, the township had forty-five inhabitants. It was then called Moorestown. In 1812 settlers occupied \" Jackson Ridge, \" in the east ern part of the town. Barnabas Tucker bought the lot and buildings of one of the first settlers and took his residence there in 1815. In 1818, Jeremiah Rolfe, settled in the plantation. He had fought at Saratoga under General Gates and afterward went to North Carolina with him. He was noted for his skill in fruit raising, and the \"Rolfe Apple\" which he introduced to the region will not soon be forgotten. Other es teemed citizens of a later time were Hons. J. S. Monroe, P. S. Lowell and James Foss. There is one citizen in the town above ninety-five years of age, and three who are over eighty. The Piscataquis river enters the township near its north-western corner, and leaves it near the south-eastern. The south branch of the Piscataquis, issuing from a pond in Kingsbury, passes across the south ern part of the town. Mr. Moore early erected a saw-mill on the river ; about which Abbot village has grown up. The town \u2014 incor porated in 1827 \u2014 was named for Professor John Abbot, a long period treasurer of Bowdoin College. The warrant for the first town meeting was issued by Robert Gower, Esq. to James Gower ; and at the meeting Cyrus Cook was chosen town clerk. There are two covered"], [72, "64 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. bridges over the Piscataquis within the limits of the town, \u2014 one being 100 the other 120 feet long. There are two railroad stations in the town. Much change has been produced in the business by the railway completed in 1874, which gives it an easy connection with Bangor. At Abbot village there are a lumber, excelsior and spool mills, a grist mill, a furniture and a pump factory and a brick yard. There are ako one or more lumber mills in other parts of the town. The Congrega tionalists, Baptists and Free Baptists have each a church in Abbot. There are eiodit public school-houses, valued at $1,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $155,197. In 1880, it was $174,669. Tho po pulation, according to the census of 1880, is 695. In 1870, it was 712. ACfldlfl, or Acadie, \u2014 a name formerly applied by the French to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and those portions of Maine lying east of the Kennebec or of the Penobscot, according as France at different times thought best to claim one or the other as the western boundary of her Atlantic territories. ActOIl, in York County, lies for its whole length of 9 miles along the New Hamshire border, \u2014 Salmon Falls River forming the boundary for three-fourths of this distance. On the north is Newfield, and on the south, Lebanon. On the east, it is bounded by Shapleigh, from which it was incorporated in 1830. Consequently much of its early history may be found under that head. Benjamin Kimens, Clement Steel and John York were the first settlers, locating at the center (Acton Corner) in 1776. At about the same time a road was cut nearly through the town from north to south, which soon brought an increase of settlers. The first grist mill was built in 1779. A Congregationalist church was formed in 1771, and a pastor (Joseph Brown), first settled in 1796. Theirs was the first meeting-house in town. It was built in 1794, about 2^ miles south of Acton Corner. In 1827 the Society- erected a new meeting-house at Acton Corner. A Baptist church was formed in 1781, by Nehemiah Davis, who was the first minister. In 1802 their house of worship was erected near the first Congregationalist house ; and a new house was erected upon the same site in 1840. The first Free-will Baptist church was formed In 1801, by Gershom Lord, \u2014 its first preacher. In 1818, a house of worship was erected in the west part of the town near Milton Mills, near where their house of worship now stands. A second society, called the Union Society of Acton was formed in 1840, and a house built the same year at the south part of the town. A Methodist church was formed in 1826. Their first regular preaching was in 1837, by Henry Linscott. A meeting-house\u00b0was erected at Acton Corner in 1840. The parsonage lot, consisting of about 300 acres, was sold in 1823, and 1843 ; the proceeds of the sale were divided among the societies mentioned, according to the number of polls in each. There is now in addition to these a church of the Christian denomination. Ralph Farnum, a soldier of the Revolution, died in 1860 at the age of one hundred and four years. The town has sent out many profes sional men."], [73, "ADDISON. 65 In regard to scenery, the town is diversified with hill and hollow, and woods of oak, beech and maple. West of the centre of the town is a remarkable valley surrounded by hills, and known as \" The Hopper.\" The carriage roads are good, but there is no railroad in town ; the nearest station being that in East Lebanon, on the Portland and Rochester Railroad. The business centres named in the order of their importance are, Acton Corners, Milton Mills, North Acton and South Acton. The number of acres of land in the town is 18,127. Little Ossipee River and Balch Pond form the northern boundary. Mousam River takes its rise from Square and Mousam ponds, at the eastern border of the town. It has also the Hubbard, Bracket andi Ricker streams. Its chief water powers are on the Little Ossipee river, \u2014 where are a saw and grist mill, and a felt mill \u2014 and at the head of Salmon Falls River, where there is a saw mill for general work. The bed rock in the town is granite and mica schist. The Acton mineral belt, from 2 to 4 miles in width, crosses the southern portion of the town. The ores consist chiefly of argentiferous galenas. There is also some zinc, arsenic and copper. Several companies are en gaged inmining these ores. Acton has fourteen public school houses ; and the school property is valued at $4,000. The number of acres of land in the town is 18,127. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $329,189. In 1880 it was $363,105. The population in 1870 was 1,007. In 1880, it was 1050. AddiSOIl is situated on the southern sea-coast of Washington* County, 18\u00a3 miles west by south-west of Machias. It is bounded on the north by Columbia, east by Jonesboro and Jonesport, west by Har rington and south by the sea. Indian River separates it from the towns on the east, and Pleasant Bay and River from those on the west. Cape Split and Moose Neck from the southern points of the town, and between these is Cape Split Harbor. Moose and Sheep are the prin cipal islands, the last lying at the south and the first at the mouth of Indian River, and near the village of that name. The rock is chiefly granitic, and the soil loamy. There is a quarry of black granite, which is considerably wrought. Potatoes form- the prin cipal crop. Spruce is the most numerous forest tree. Elm and balm of gilead are found along the village streets or about the dwellings. . The Addison Mineral Spring has a local reputation. The villages are Addison at the north-west at the head of Pleasant River Bay, and Indian River on the eastern side. The Jonesport and Columbia stage line furnishes communication by land. Each village' is about 11 miles from the landing of the Portland steamer at Mill bridge. The manufactures are lumber, carriages, sails, etc. There are 2 shipyards. Vessels of 300 tons can load within 20 rods of the mills. Addison was settled soon after the close of the Revolutionary War,. and was organized as a plantation known as \" Number Six west of Machias.\" It was incorporated as a town in 1796, being named in honor the elegant English writer, Joseph Addison. There are Baptist, Methodist and Universalist churches at Addison' village, and Baptist and Advent churches at Indian River.

Greenwood bounds it on the north east, Mason and Stoneham on the south-west, Mason and Bethel on the north-west, and Waterford and Norway on the south-east. Its size is about 7^ by 10 miles. The northern half of the western border is occupied by the \" Albany Mountains \" of which the chief is Bear Mountain. The middle portion of the eastern side is occupied by a group of seven or more mountains, bearing the names of Lawrence, Long, Round, etc., of which the last is the highest, having an altitude of about 500 feet. At the north-eastern corner is another lofty hill and half way to the center of the town is another. Flint's Mountain stands in the middle of the southern part of the town, flanked by two others in a line to the north-east. Somewhat to the west of the middle dine of the town, running through its length from north to south, six ihills succeed one another at nearly equal distances. Birch Hill is the -most southern, while the fourth \u2014 Square Doch \u2014 stands about midway of the line. Through the broad valley south of this, Crooked River \u00abweeps westward, forming a semi-circle about the two southern hills. West of Square Doch comes down a tributary to Crooked River, on which are the noted \" Albany Basins.\" They are a series of deep cav ities formed by the eddying current of the water in the talcose rock forming the bed of the stream. One of these basins is not less than 70 feet deep while only about 40 in diameter. Songo Pond, having an area of about 1 square mile, lies in the northern part of the town, forming the source of Crooked River. This stream takes a general southern course through the town, and dis charges its waters into Sebago Lake. Other ponds are Furlong's, at the south-eastern corner, Hutchinson, a little west of the last, Chalk Pond, near Chalk Hill, Little Pappoose Pond, near the western border, and Broken Bridge Pond, north of Square Doch, and several smaller ones. About a mile north of this pond is an extensive ledge of pure quartz. Albany post office and the factories at the south-west corner of the town are the-centers of business. The manufactures consist of lumber, shingles, staves, boxes, spools, boots and shoes. Albany post office is about 8 miles south of Bethel Hill, on the Grand Trunk Railway, which is the nearest railway station. The soil of the town is of fair quality. The principal crop for the market is hay. Albany was settled soon after the Revolution, being known for some time as the Plantation of Oxford. It was incorporated in 1803.

The town is about six miles square. The prevailing rock is granite. The soil in the westerly part is clay loam, free from stones, and quite easily cultivated ; and all parts are produc tive. The principal crop is hay. The southern portion of the town is much broken by hills, and is well suited to wheat. Lovejoy's Pond \u2014 a mile and one-half long and a mile wide \u2014 is the principal body of water. The outlet to this, which empties into Fifteen Mile River, fur nishes power for a saw-mill. On Fifteen Mile River, which runs northwardly through the town, are two or more powers in the southern part utilized for saw-mills. In the northern part is a tannery. The principal settlements are at Albion Corner and South Albion, each of which has a post-office. The town is about 27 miles north-east of Augusta, and 44 south-west of Bangor. It is on the stage-line from Fairfield to Belfast. There are two railroad stations at a distance of 7 and 10 miles, respectively. The first organization of this place was the plantation of Free town in 1802. In 1804 it was organized as a town called Fairfax, which was afterwards changed to Lygonia, and lastly, in 1824, to Albion. The township was first settled sometime prior to 1690, at which date it contained 6 families. ' Many of the early settlers were from York County, \u2014 among whom were the Shoreys, Prays and Lib beys. Hon. Artemus Libbey, one of the associate justices of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, is a native of this town. Albion sent 100 soldiers iuto the army during the war of the Rebellion, \u2014 of whom 45 w-ere lost. The churches in town are the Christian Disciples, Adventist, and Universalist.

Baileyville and Baring bound it on the east, Crawford on the west, Princeton on the north, and Cooper and Med dybemps on the south. The surface is uneven, but there is a variety of good farming land. Agriculture is the almost exclusive dependence of the inhabitants. The principal crop for export is hay. The nearest seaport is Calais, 14 miles eastward ; Machias, 30 miles distant, is the nearest on the south. The nearest railroad station is at Baring, 10 miles distant. The Wapskanegan is the principal stream, running north-east from the west and centre of the town. The sheets of water are Lake Beau tiful, in the western part of the town ; Burrows, at the south-western corner ; Shining Lake, lying on the northern, and Meddybemps Lake, on th'e eastern border. Lake Beautiful -has an area of about 500 acres, and furnishes power for a saw and shingle mill about half the year. Alexander was first settled about 1810. Among the first who made the place their home were Solomon Perkins, Caleb Pike, George Hill, A. Bohanan, William D. Crockett, Paul Morse, Cyrus Young and"], [76, "68 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Samuel Cottel. The early settlers were mostly from Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The titles to their lands were obtained from Colonel John Black, agent for the Binghams. The town was incorpo rated in 1835, and may have received its name in honor of Alexander Baring, a son-in law of William Bingham. He was about this time made Lord Ashburton ; and it was he who, as British Ambassador, settled \u2014 together with the American Secretary of State, Daniel Web ster \u2014 our north-eastern boundary.

The town is about 12 miles long from north-west to south-east, and 4 miles wide at the middle, and contains 12,989 acres of land. The northern part is hilly, and abounds in granite rocks and hard wood forests, while the southern portion is comparatively level, with evergreen and hard woods. The soil is a gravelly loam in higher lands and sandy loam on the plains. The chief eminence is Yeaton's Hill. The town has good roads, and the general appearance of the buildings indicate thrift. The principal bodies of water are Shaker and Middle Branch, or Bungernuck Ponds, the first in the eastern and middle part of the town, and the latter at the north. The princi pal streams are Hay Brook on the west, and the outlets of the ponds \u2014 all running southward and joining with the Mousam River on the south-west. The manufactories are woollen, saw and grist mills at Littlefield's Mills, and the Shaker's saw-mill. The business centres are Alfred Village, Littlefield's Mills, North Alfred and the Shaker Village. The early history of the town is involved in that of Sanford, and it formerly bore the name of the \" North Parish of Sandford,\" and the Indian name of Massabesic. It was incorporated in 1794, being named in honor of Alfred the Great. The territory of the town was included in several quit-claim deeds purchased in 1761-4 of the Indian chiefs Fluellen, Hobinowell, and Captain Sunday, by Major William Phillips, of Saco. The first settler was Simeon Coffin, who in 1764, dwelt for a time in an Indian wigwam, a few rods south-west of the present residence of Colonel Ivory Hall. There were, at that time, several Indian fam ilies about Shaker Pond and the Hill. Other settlers soon followed. The first saw mill in town was built in 1766, by Charles and John White, a Mr. Ellenwood, Thomas Kimball, Seth Peabody and Benja min Tripe. In 1782 a few families of Shakers settled at Moosebesic or Shaker Pond and Hill, and at Mastcamp, a few miles north. They were at this time, fanatical in religion and intemperate in 'their indulgences. They were organized as a body in their present order and discipline in 1793. In 1782 a Congregational church was organized in Alfred,"], [77, "ALNA 69 forming the North Parish of Sanford ; but in revivals some became excited and joined the \" Merry Dancers \" (as the Shakers were then called), so that a minister was not settled until 1791. In 1834 the present house was erected, and an organ added in 1854. The Baptists built a church on the Back Road in 1818, and another at Littlefield's Mills soon after 1855. A second church was organized at the Gore in 1841, and a church built there in 1847. The first permanent meeting of Methodists was in 1830, by Rev. John Lord, at the court-house ; and in 1834 a church was built. There is now an Advent Society also. Alfred became a half shire town in 1802 ; and a court-house was erected in 1807, which was remodelled and enlarged in 1852. The present fire-proof wings were finished in the fall of 1854. A log jail was built in 1803, and the present stone jail in 1870. The town-house was erected in 1854, and burnt in 1861. The new one was built in 1862. The Academy building was erected by private subscription in 1828. W. C. Larrabee was the first preceptor. It was kept in opera tion for some time each year until the erection of the graded school building in 1862. The High School is at Alfred village. There are now seven school-houses in the town, and the value of the school prop erty is estimated at $5,500. The population in 1850 was 1,319 ; 1870, 1,224; 1880,1,102. Valuation of 1870, $427,140 ; ot 1880, $421,418. Rate of taxation in the latter year, about 19 mills on a dollar. The most notable citizens have been Hon.

The surface is uneven, the western part back from the river being quite broken, while the other portions abound in ledges and bogs. Good soil is found in many parts, however, espe cially along the river. In the centre of the town is a pond receiving two considerable streams, and discharging into Sheepscot River. This"], [78, "70 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. stream forms the eastern line of the town, and crosses its northern part. The water powers are Sheepscot Falls carrying a saw and grist mill, and \" Head-of-the-Tide Falls,\" in the northern part five miles above the first, having a grist, a stave and a shingle mill. Two miles above this are the \" Rapids,\" which afford a good privilege. The vil lages are at the first two falls mentioned, that at the head of the tide being the largest. It is eight miles north of Wiscasset, and is the terminus of the stage line from Gardiner, on the Kennebec. The town was formerly the north precinct of Pownalborough. It was set off in 1794 and incorporated as New Milford ; which name it bore until 1811, when this was changed to Alna. The first church was formed in 1796, Jonathan Scott being chosen first pastor. There are now a Congregationalist and a Baptist church. Alna has six pub lic school houses ; the school property being valued at $3,300. The valuation of estate in 1870 was $233,610.

Lagrange lies on the north, Bradford and Hudson on the west and Oldtown on the south. The Bangor and Piscataquis Railroad runs north-westward through the town. Alton is the terminus and rafting-place of the Upper Penobscot boom. Dead Stream in the north-western part of the town, Pushaw Stream, in the south-western part, and Birch Stream, forming the eastern line of division from Argyle, are the principal water-courses. The ponds bear the names Hallen Large and Hallen Small, Pickerel and Mud. The surface of the town is quite level. What rock appears is of a slaty character. The soil is in general a reddish loam, but in some places is a dark muck. Hay, potatoes and oats are the principal crops. The forests contain the varieties of trees common to the region. There is a saw and grist mill at Alton Village Mills, on Dead Stream, in the north-western part of the town. In the western part is a large tan nery. Alton was formerly a part of Argyle, which adjoins it on the east. It was incorported in 1845. The town has four public school-houses, and its school property is valued at $1,000. The valuation in 1870 was $116,362. In 1880, it was $78,959. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 3 per centum. The population in 1870, was 508. In 1880, it was 419. AlllherSt is situated on Union River, 22 miles north-north-east of Ellsworth, and about midway of Hancock County. It is bounded on the north by Township No. 2, east by Aurora, south by Mariaville, and west by Clifton, in Penobscot County. Its territory is 6 miles square. It has several good water powers, improved by one saw, one clapboard, one grain, and two shingle mills. There is also a sole-leather tannery, using hides from South America and Mexico principally. The village is near the centre of the town. It is on the stage-lines from Ellsworth and Aurora to Bangor. The river divides the town diagonally into two nearly equal sections, the north-west and the south-east. The land on the east side of the river is favorable to orcharding ; but on the west, excepting intervals, the soil is granitic and the surface hilly. The principal hills are known as the Springy Brook Mountains. Near the"], [79, "AMITY. 71 Corner is a high ledge some acres in extent, thought to be porphyritic, and containing crystals of iron pyrites, with compact feldspar. Crystals of quartz are also found. There is some slate in the town. Amherst is remarkable for its improved domestic cattle; and this is due mainly to the energy and enterprise of A. B. Buzzell, Esq. This town was a part of the Bingham purchase. It was set off from the plantation of Mariaville in 1822, and incorporated in 1831. Amherst N. H. is said to have been honored in the selection of its name. Settle ment began about 1805. In that year Capt. Goodell Silsby came in, and in 1806-7 his parents came and took the lots now known as the \" Old Silsby Place.\" Before 1808 closed there had come in, also, Mrs. Kimball, Asahel Foster, Jesse Gils, Joseph Day, Judah West, and Elisha Chick. Amherst has four public schoolhouses, valued at $425. The valua tion of estates in 1870, was $57,276. In the valuation of 1880, it was $72,524. Rate of taxation, about 2 per cent.

The St. Croix River forms the eastern boundary line ; and Mattawamkeag River has its source in the south-western part of the town. In the northern part a branch of the St. John has its rise. The surface of the town is rolling, and it is still well covered with hard-wood. The outcropping rocks are granite and slate. The soil is gravelly and clayey loam. Hay is the principal crop exported. The forest trees are chiefly maple, birch, hemlock, basswood and spruce. The streams mentioned attain within the limits of the town sufficient depth to float lumber. The manufactories of the town consist of one mill running an up-and down saw, and a small grist mill. The nearest railroad connections are at Houlton on the north and Danforth on the south, \u2014 each about 15 miles distant. Amity was incorporated in 1836. The township had previously been known as No. 10, first range. Settlement was commenced in 1826 by Jonathan T. Clifford, Jonathan Greenleaf and Columbus Dunn. The early settlers bought their lands for twenty cents per acre, payable one half in cash and one half in work on the public highways. Since the incorporation of the town, the remaining lands were bought of the State by speculators. This has retarded the growth of the town, as the prices asked have been much higher than those of the State for lands at other points in the county. The First Baptist society have here a very good church newly built. The moral tone of society is excellent for a border town. The public entertainments are lectures, lyceums, and lodge meetings of I. O. of G. T. Amity has three public schoolhouses, and her total school prop erty is valued at $1,200. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $44, 675. In 1880 it was $44,476.

The town is surrounded by moun tains and is a region of grand and beautiful scenery. It has within its own borders Gregg Mountain in the northern part, the extended ridge of Long Mountain in the western, and Lone Mountain near the middle of the town. Wyman Hill, in the North Surplus, sends a considerable section down over the border. In the south-eastern corner of the town are Farmer's Hill, and a lesser neighbor. Yet the surface of the town in the broad valleys between these mountains is quite smooth, consist ing of elevated pine plains and extensive intervales ; and there is a large quantity of good land in the town. Ellis River, the outlet of Ellis Pond, in Roxbury on the east, receives its branches near the centre of the town, then runs in a southerly course through this town and Rum ford adjoining, to the Androscoggin River. Its tributaries here are West Branch, Sawyer's and Black Brooks, and the outlet of Horse shoe Pond, situated in the south-east corner of the town. The villages are Andover Corner and South Andover, \u2014 the first a little north, and the last a short distance to the south of the centre of the town. Bry ant's Pond Station, 20 miles south, is the railroad connection. A line of stages runs between the two ] daces. Andover Corner is a favorite resort for city people, and is the head quarters of fishermen, who, in the season, resort to the Rangeley- Lakes, a short distance northward. The general plane of the town is 500 feet above the sea, and much resembles North Conway, N H. The village has an excellent hotel, a town-hall capable of seating 300 persons, a trotting park, an apothecary store, etc. There are very attractive drives in the neighborhood \u2014 as Black Brook Notch, White Cap Moun tain, \u2014 which has a good carriage road to near its top; Farmer's Hill, Bald Pate Mountain, Sawyer's Notch, Ellis River Falls, the Devil's Den, Hermit Falls, Silver Ripple Cascade, the Cataracts, etc. The manufactures of the town are lumber, doors, sash and blinds, starch, cheese (factory) boots and shoes, edge-tools, carriages and har nesses. This township was purchased in 1791 of Massachusetts, by Samuel Johnson and others of Old Andover. It was incorporated in 1804 under the name of East Andover, but in 1821 became Andover, simply. The first settler was Ezekiel Merrill, who in 1789, came with his wife and six children from Andover, Mass., to this place, \u2014 having stopped by the way at Fryeburgh. He and his three sons drew their effects on hand-sleds through the woods, the only guide being the spotted trail of the Indians. Mrs. Merrill lived here for three years without seeing the face of any white female save her own three daugh ters.. The next settlers were Jonathan Abbott, Samuel and Sylvanus Poor, Theodore Brickett, Francis Swan, Josiah Wright, John Abbott, Jeremiah Burnham, and others from Andover, Mass. These were of the most respectable families of Old Andover; and this namesake on the borders of civilization has ever been noted for its good society and high standard of morals. The first mills were erected in 1791 by Colonel Thomas Poor. The first church was formed in 1804. The first minister settled was Rev. John Strickland, in 1806. There are now a Congregational and a"], [81, "ANDROSCOGGIN COUNTY. 73 Methodist church in the town. Andover has six public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $3,000.

AlldOVei*. \u2014 North, West, and C Surplus, are unincorporated and mountainous tracts north and west of the town of Andover. Al together they contain scarcely more than half a dozen dwellings. They have several high hills, of which Wyman's Hill and Moody Mountain are the chief. The west branch of Ellis River rises in Dunn's Notch and its neighborhood, in the western part of Andover North Surplus. AndrOSCOgsglll Coiinty lies in the midst of the south western section of Maine, having its greatest length from north to south. The Androscoggin River passes through it longitudinally, dividing it into two nearly equal parts. The county derives its name from that of the river, which is a corruption of Anasagunticook, the name of the Indian tribe which formerly occupied the region. It con tains the larger proportion of the practically available water power of the Androscoggin and its tributaries, including three of the greatest powers on the main river. The county buildings are at Auburn, where, too, the courts are held. The county was organized March 18th, 1854 ; having gained its territory from five other counties. Auburn, Danville (the latter since annexed to the former), Durham, Poland and Minot were taken from Cumberland County ; Livermore and Turner from Oxford County; East Livermore, Leeds, Greene, and Wales from Kennebec; and Lewiston, Webster and Lisbon, from Lincoln. The county con tains eleven towns and two cities, most of them thrifty and several of them exceedingly flourishing. These are the cities of Auburn and Lewis ton, and the towns of Durham, East Livermore, Green, Leeds, Lisbon, Livermore, Minot, Poland, Turner, Wales and Webster. The area of the county is about 400 square miles. The population in 1870 was 35,866 ; in 1880, it was 45,063. The value of estates in 1870 was $17,592,555. In 1880, it was $20,776,973. The surface of the country is in general very uneven, having many high hills, but no mountains. Its ponds, springs and rivulets are numerous. Within its limits are Auburn Lake, Androscoggin, Sabat tus, Taylor, Thompson and Trip Ponds, and the noted mineral springs of Poland, West Auburn and Lewiston. There are few extensive bogs, and there is little other waste land. The agricultural qualities of the county are not surpassed in the southern half of the State, and its manufactures are more extensive than that of any other county. The Grand Trunk Railroad, with its Lewiston and Auburn branch, the Buckfield and Rumford Falls Railroad, the Maine Central Railroad, with its Androscoggin and Farmington branches, afford superior facil ities for travel and commerce within and beyond its borders. Un usual interest has been taken in education. Bates College is rapidly advancing to a first-class institution ; and to it is now added a Theo logical and a fitting-school. Hebron Academy, in Hebron, has long had an excellent reputation, while the Auburn and Lewiston schools from primary to high are probably not surpassed in the State.

Madison bounds it on the east, Embden and New Port land on the north, Starks on the south, and Industry and New Vine yard, in Franklin County, on the West. The Kennebec river separates it from Madison, and the Carabasset River passing through the north east corner of the town forms a junction with the Kenebec at North Anson village. Carabasset Falls and Rapids at this place afford several interesting views. The strong whirling currents near the bridge at the village have worn the slatey rocks into many peculiar forms, and the scene is very striking to the stranger. This village, being the northern terminus of the Somerset Railroad, is the centre of business for a wide extent of country, and is, therefore, very thriv ing. It is about 33 miles from Waterville and 100 from Portland by railroad. The manufactories of the town are clustered at this point. They consist of boots, shoes, leather, bricks, lumber, flour, wool rolls, etc. The are two saw mills, and three boot and shoe manufactories. The most extensive manufacturer is S. Bunker. The company doing the most business is Carrabasset Mills. On the Kennebec in the southern part of the town is Anson Village. It is opposite Madison Village on the eastern side of the river, and is connected therewith by an excellent bridge. The surface of the town is moderately level, but broken by high hills in the central and western part, known as Lane, Gamage and Collins hills. There is much rich alluvial soil in the town. Agricul ture is the chief occupation of the inhabitants, and is profitably followed. Settlements were made here at about the same time as at Norridge wock ; adventurers pushing up the river in order to take possession of the rich alluvial lands on the banks of the Kennebec. When surveyed, Anson was found to be outside the limits of the Plymouth patent, and it was accordingly called Township Number 1, west of the Kennebec river, north of the Plymouth patent. It was incorporated in 1798 under its present name. In 1845 it was divided, and North Anson incorporated out of it ; but a re-union of the parts took place in 1855. North Anson has in the \" Union Advocate \" a valuable local and county paper. It is issued every Wednesday by Albert Moore & Son. Its politics are democratic. The Congregationalists, Free Baptists, Methodists and Universalists each have churches in Anson. The town has twenty-one public schoolhouses ; the total school property being valued at $3,500.

The Medomac and St. George's rivers run through the town. Sennebec Pond is the principal body of water, being two miles in length and one in width. Appleton Ridge \u2014 which has a height of about 300 feet \u2014 is the greatest elevation The ledges are generally of a brittle, gray rock. The soil on the uplands is generally rocky, and clayey in the valleys. Hemlock, spruce, beech and maple form the mass of the woods. The principal crops are corn, potatoes, wheat, oats and hay. Medomac River drains the western part and St. George's the eastern part of the town. At Appleton village are a grist mill, a lumber and stave mill, fac tories for the manufacture of carriages, hand-rakes, cultivators, leather, boots and shoes, etc. Some lime is produced for export at this place. At North Appleton are a lumber mill, lime quarry, etc. At North Union P. O. is a lumber mill. The Appleton Mining and Smelting Company is an enterprise of this town. The inhabitants are generally thrifty, and most of the build ings are in good repair. In the village some of the streets are pleas antly shaded with trees ; many of the elms being upward of forty years of age. The climate is salubrious, and the town boasts a number of inhabitants upwards of ninety years of age. The longest bridge in the town is about 120 feet in length. It is of wood, with stone abutments. The principal public entertainments are Temperance Reform Club meetings. These, when supplemented by some literary exercises, be come more generally useful and improving ; and the increased variety sustains the interest for many seasons in succession. The Methodist and Baptists each have a church edifice in town. Appleton has ten public schoolhouses, which, together with other school property, are valued at $4,950. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $284,278. In 1880 it was $320,664. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 2\u00a3 per cent. The population in 1870 was 1,485 ; in 1880 it was 1,348. Al'^yle, in Penobscot County, is situated on the west bank of the Penobscot River, 20 miles west of Bangor. Greenbush, on the oppo site side of the Penobscot, bounds it on the east, Edinburg on the north and Oldtown on the south. On the west is Alton, separated from it by Birch Stream. Hoyt Brook and Hemlock Stream, running south ward through the north-eastern part of the town, each furnish water power. The surface of the town is generally level, with consider able swamp. Granite and a hard, shaley stone are the principal rocks. The soil is a clay loam, aud yields well of hay and potatoes, which form the chief crops. Pine, spruce, hemlock and cedar are found in the woods. There is a shingle mill on Hemlock Drook, and a saw mill with shingle machine on Hoyt Brook. The buildings are generally in good repair, and the town has a fair degree of prosperity. Argyle village is on the Penobscot River, about midway of the eastern side of town. The county road to Oldtown passes through it. The nearest railroad connection is with the Bangor and Piscataquis Railroad at the Alton Station, about 4 miles west."], [84, "76 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Argyle was incorporated in 1839. The Methodists have a conven ient church at the village. The principal public entertainments are temperance meetings, lyceums and lectures. There are four public schoolhouses. The school property is valued at $500. The town val uation in 1870 was $51,502. In 1880 it was $50,389. The population in 1870 was 307. In 1880 it was 285. Al*OOStOOk COUllty embraces the north-eastern portion of the State ; having New Brunswick for its eastern boundary, and the Province of Quebec for its northern and western boundary, \u2014 both states of the British Dominion of Canada. On the south its boundaries are within the State ; and consist of Washington County on the east ; succeeded in order by Penobscot, Piscataquis and Somerset. The St. John and its branches, viz : the St. Francis, Allagash, Fish and Aroostook are its principal rivers. The St. John has its rise in the western part and the adjacent territories, and sweeps through and around its entire breadth from east to west, forming also about two- thirds of its northern boundary. In the south-eastern part, the St. Croix and the Mattawamkeag have their sources. The entire northern part of Aroostook county might be denomin- ated the valley of the St. John in Maine. It is a valley as respects the western interior of the State, but a nearly level elevated plateau, with respect to the lower part of the river. The St. John leaves our terri- tory with an elevation at the boundary of 419 feet, and the Aroostook at 345 feet; this amount of fall being lost to the State. At the mouth of the St. Francis, on the extreme north, the elevation of the St. John above tide water is 606 feet. The mean slope on the boundary (70 miles) is therefore 2.6 feet per mile. The elevation of the stream at the point of its formation in the south-western part of the county, viz: at the junction of north-west, south-west St. John and the Woolasta- quaguam, is probably about 750 feet. The distance thence to the point where the St. John leaves the State boundary is 158 miles, showing a mean slope in that distance of 1.8 feet per mile. Accordingly the St. John is navigable in its whole length in Maine, and is, therefore, of comparatively little value for power. Sufficient of this, however, is found in the tributary streams for all ordinary purposes. The Allaguash falls from Chamberlain Lake to the St. John, about 308 feet, \u2014 very little over three feet to the mile. The total number of lakes in the St. John basin in Maine appearing upon the official map of the State, is 206. The number due to its size, in proportion to the number in the rest of the State, is 307, showing a numerical deficiency of 45. Such, therefore, is the general levelness of the surface in the interior of this country that quite extensive districts are permanently swampy. The principal bodies of water are Upper Schoodic, Eagle, Allegash, Portage, St. Francis, Squapan, Pleasant, Mattawamkeag, Wytopitloek and Mattaceunk lakes. There is a line of greater elevation across the east ern part of the county \u2014 marked on the boundary by Mars Hill (1,800 feet in height)\u2014 -dividing the waters of the Aroostook from those of the southward running rivers. Yet the borders of the county and many portions of the interior are undulating. Nearly the whole of the county is underlaid by a stratum of calcareous shale that is generally not far from the surface. [For a detailed account of the rocks of this county and of the State consult the article on Geology, Mineralogy,"], [85, "AROOSTOOK COUNTY. 77 etc., in the early part of this volume.] The face of the country is peculiarly marked by long ridges of gravel and sand, varying in height from 50 to 300 feet, and running, sometimes, 50 miles in a direct course. They are known as \"horsebacks,\" and are probably memorials of the close of the glacial and beginning of the drift period. The soil is, largely alluvial, rich in vegetable matter, exceedingly fertile, and easily worked. It takes a great deal of dry weather to seriously dam age the grass and grain crops. Potatoes constitute a large part of the crop in the eastern part of the county, and are highly esteemed for their superior dryness and flavor. Where the land has not been cleared, it is covered by forests of spruce, pine, cedar, birch and maple. The settled portions are chiefly along the eastern border ; and so small a proportion do the settlements bear to the territory that there is hardly a township or plantation whose borders are not touched by the vast forest running back to the shores of the St. Lawrence without a clearing. In the vast extent of woods, and far back among the lonely lakes, moose are still plentiful, and great herds of caribou range over the country. Many other wild ani mals, now rare in other parts, are common here ; and foxes, bears, deer, wolves, lynxes, beavers, fishers, otters, sable, and mink, are still trapped and hunted in Aroostook county with abundant success. In most of the streams, especially the more remote, trout are abundant, and some of the lakes offer fine fishing for land-locked salmon, pickerel and perch. Aroostook was formed in March, 1839, from parts of Penobscot and Washington counties, with Houlton for its shire town. The first settlements were by Acadian French, refugees from the Bay of Minas, Nova Scotia, after the invasion by Colonel Monckton in 1775. But though the earliest settlements these were not the most important. The honor of initiating the movements which have led to the present development of the county belongs to the settlers of Houlton, on the Meduxnekeag River at the eastern border, and 120 miles north-east of Bangor. In 1826 arose the north-eastern boundary dispute, which brought this region into much prominence ; and it became the scene of the bloodless Madawaska and Aroostook wars. Until 1812 there was no controversy about the boundary, \u2014 the St. Croix being agreed upon as the proper division ; but beyond the monument which marked the head of this river, all was undetermined. After the treaty of Ghent a commission of English and American engineers was appointed to run the boundary line. It was to run due north to the highlands, from which the waters flow toward the Atlantic and toward the St. Lawrence. They found no difference of opinion until they reached Mars Hill, an isolated mountain about 40 miles north of the monu ment, 30 miles north of Houlton, and 4 or 5 miles west of St. John's River. The English engineers then claimed that they had reached the \" highlands,\" while the Americans dissented ; and both parties re turned to report to their respective governments. To provide for an emergency, the United States ordered a body of troops to Houlton, where they arrived in October, 1826. Barracks and officer's quarters were provided for them on Garrison Hill ; and the troops remained there until the final settlement of the boundary dispute in 1842. In 1828, Congress made provision for a military road from Bangor to Houlton, which was completed in 1830. This formed an excellent"], [86, "78 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. highway, and did much to open this fine region to pioneers. In 1837 an agent of the Federal Government, while engaged in taking a census of the French near the Madaw-aska river, was arrested and imprisoned ; but on conference between the government of New Brunswick and the United States government, he was released. Again in 1839, it was reported to the State authorities that New Brunswick lumbermen were engaged in taking away large quantities of timber from the dis- puted territory. This was the opening of the \" Aroostook war,\" an account of which will be found in the article on the civil history of the State, in the first part of this volume. Following this disturbance the settlement of the county received a great impetus. In 1843 the county was enlarged by additions from Penobscot, and in 1844 from Piscata- quis and Somerset counties. The county is divided by the State sur- vey into 181 townships, and into three registration districts. There are now 34 incorporated towns and 28 organized plantations. The towns are Amity, Ashland, Benedicta, Blaine, Bridgewater, Caribou, Easton, Fort Fairfield, Fort Kent, Frenchville, Grand Isle, Haynes ville, Hersey, Hodgdon, Houlton, Island Falls, Linneus, Limestone, Littleton, Ludlow, Madawaska, Mapleton, Mars Hill, Masardis, Mays ville, Monticello, NewLimerick, Orient, Presque Isle, Sherman, Smyrna, Washburn, Weston, and Woodland. The valuation of these in 1870 was $4,995,685. In 1880 it was $5,225,834. The taxable polls in 1870 was 5,212. In 1880 they numbered 7,734. The population in 1870 was 29,609. In 1880 it was 41,700. ArrOWSIC, in Sagadahoc County, is a town and an island sit uated in the Kennebec river, near its mouth. The small portion of the Kennebec that turns eastward around this island, then southward between Georgetown and Arrowsie, is called Back River. On the north of Arrowsie is Woolwich, on the west of the northern part is Bath, and west of the southern is Phippsburg. The island is nearly 7 miles in length from north to south, and averages about 1 mile in width. It contains some 5,000 acres. There is a considerable hill at the southern part, and the middle of the island is generally highest, but the elevation is small. The southern point bears the name of Bald Head. There is very little marsh, several inlets, and near the middle of the island is Sewall's Pond, \u2014 a sheet of fresh water about three fourths of a mile long and one-fourth wide. Fisher's Eddy, near the middle of the western side, forms a small harbor. Iron ore is found on the island, and a mineral was for some time mined here, which was ground in a crushing mill at Bath, for use as a substitute for emery in grinding and polishing metals. The town has four saw mills, all oper ated by tide power. The soil is a clay loam. Potatoes, corn, barley, beans and wheat yield well. This island was purchased of the Indians by Major Clarke and Captain Lake in 1661. At this time there was a fort on the west side of Arrowsie or of Woolwich which was occupied by one Hammond, an old Indian trader. This fort was captured in August of the second year of the first Indian war by the treachery of some squaws, who bego-ed for, and obtained, lodgings within it. The resentment of the Indians is said to have been directed against this place on account of the loss of furs and arms stolen by the English from some of their tribe. On Arrowsie Island, about two miles distant from Hammond's, Clark and"], [87, "ASHLAND. 79 Lake had constructed a larger and stronger fort. They had also in the vicinity a mansion house, mills, out-buildings, cultivated fields and domestic cattle. This flourishing establishment was surprised and destroyed in the same incursion and by the same savages who destroyed Hammond's. Captain Lake in attempting to escape was mortally wounded. In answer to a petition of 26 men in their behalf, in 1679, Governor Andros assigned to them the lower part of Arrowsie for a compact settlement. Here they established themselves, therefore, and built a fort, naming the place Newtown. In 1689 this settlement was burnt by the Indians, with the exception of a single house. Again, a short time before the building of Fort Halifax on the river opposite the present Waterville, the Norridgewock Indians made a descent upon Arrowsie, killing a Mr. Preble while he was at work in his field. They then proceeded to his house, murdered his wife, and took his children (a son and two daughters) to Canada. After peace was made in 1763, Captain Hamden, a relative of theirs, visited Canada and obtained the release of the children. The island was three times (in 1676, 1689 and 1722) swept nearly clean of inhabitants by the savages. Remains of cellars and dwellings are still to be seen memorials of the pioneers and of Indian savagery. Arrowsie was originally embraced in Georgetown, but in 1841 it was set off and incorporated under its present name. The first known house of worship in the Sagadahoe region was erected probably about 1660, at the northern point of the island. In the southern pail was built, in 1761, the meeting house of the first parish of Georgetown. The present house of worship in Arrowsie belongs to the Methodists. Arrowsie has two schoolhouses, valued with their lots, at $400. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $103,093. In 1880, it was $86,398. The rate taxation in the latter year was 22 mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 252. In 1880 it was 255. Aslldclle, a post-office in Sagadahoe County. Aslllftlld is situated near the middle of Aroostook County. Buchanan plantation bounds it on the north, and Masardis on the south. In the township at the east stands Haystack Mountain, and about two townships distant, at the south-west, is the Aroostook range of moun tains. The surface of the town is generally even. The Aroostook river runs in an oxbow form through the town, with the principal bend toward the west. The Little Machias, forming the outlet of Portage Lake, comes in at the north-west corner of the town, and Big Machias, hav ing its source in several lakes in the southern interior of the county, comes in at the middle of the western line. On the first are Kendall's Mills, and the second Flint's. Numerous streams rise and run south ward in the eastward part of the town, emptying into a tributary of the Aroostook river. The manufactures are lumber, starch, cheese, etc. The settlements are principally along the Aroostook River. The village is on the east side of the river near the middle of the town. There is a bridge across the Aroostook near this point, which is 350 feet in length. This point is 66 miles northwest of Houltan, by stage road via Presque Isle, and is also the terminus of stage-lines from Patten to Fort Kent. The nearest railroad connection is at Caribou, 30 miles distant."], [88, "80 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. The settlement was begun about 1835 by William Dalton, who In that year made his habitation at the junction of the Big Machias with the Aroostook. Benjamin Howe followed a year or two afterward, settling on the Aroostook a short distance above Dalton. The township was lotted by Noah Barker during the years 1839-40. The Fairbanks road, leading to Presque Isle, was opened at the same date. The Aroostook road, which extends from the military road 7 miles above Mattawamkeag Point to the north line of this township, though cut through a year or two previous, was not made passable till about 1843. The Fish River road, surveyed and opened in 1839, runs from the terminus of the former northerly to the mouth of Fish River. There is also a road running from this point to the Allagash River. The town was incorporated in 1862, under the name of Ashland. Tn 1869 the name was changed to Dalton, in honor of the first settler, but it was changed back to Ashland in 1876. The town is favored with churches of the Episcopalians, Congregationalists and Free Bap tists. Ashland has five public school-houses, and the total school prop erty is valued at $2,000. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $98,531. In 1880 it was $90,725. The population in 1880 was 505. AtlieilS is situated in the southern part of Somerset County> the south-western angle of Piscataquis county resting on the north eastern angle of the town. It is bounded on the north by- Brighton, east by Harmony, south by Cornville and Hartland, and west by Solon. The northern, middle and southern portions of the town are generally level, but there is a group of hills in the east and broad hills or elevated plateaus in the south-western part. The latter is above a square mile in area, und has numerous dwellings. The hills in the eastern part bear the names of Lord's and Stickney's hills and Porcupine Mountain the last being the highest. The principal sheets of water are Went, worth and Barker Ponds ; the first having an area of one by three miles, the last of one by two miles. The Wesserunsett River formed in the southern part of the town by the union of its several tributaries, fur nishes the water power at Athens village. Wentworth Pond, situated upon the northern part of the western line, furnishes by its outlet several powers, including that at Fellow's Mills, near the centre of the town. On this stream and on the Wesserunsett, at Athens village, are two circular saw mills, three shingle mills and two grist mills. Other manufacture sare carriages, harnesses, boots and shoes, cabinetwork, etc. Athens is 12 miles north north-west of Skowhegan, which affords the nearest railroad connection. The town is on the Skowhegan and Moosehead Lake and the Skowhegan and Athens stage lines. It is 50 miles from Augusta. Athens village has several streets well shaded with maple and elm, and attractive for their pleasant residences. Gran ite is the principal rock in the town. The soil is chiefly clay loam. The chief agricultural product is hay, but good crops of grain and potatoes are obtained. Pease Spring has a local celebrity, and should be better known. Athens was settled about 1782, and was incorporated in 1804. The town has a good Union church. Somerset Academy is an insti tution of good repute and furnishes the high school instruction of the town. The number of public school houses is fourteen ; which, with the connected property, are valued at $4,000. The valuation of the"], [89, "AUBURN. 81 town in 1870 was $428,069. In 1880, it was $367,878. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 13 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,540. In 1880, it was 1,310. AtkinSOn is situated in the southernpart of Piscataquis county. It is bounded north by Sebec, east by Orneville, west by Dover, and south by Charleston, in Penobscot county. The surface is rolling and the soil generally good ; the poorer portions mostly lying in a body along Alder Stream. The titles are from Vaughn and Merrick, of Hallowell, who purchased of Massachusetts at twenty-five cents an acre. They commenced selling lots about 1801, but soon after disposed of what remained to Judge Atkinson and Oliver Crosby, of Dover, New Hampshire. It was lotted out for them in 1807 by Andrew Strong into one hundred acre lots. The town was incorporated in 1819, and named in honor of Judge Atkinson, who had given the inhabitants a library of one hundred volumes. What water-power the town has is near the centre, on Alder Stream, and on Dead Stream near the south-eastern part. Upon the first of these, in 1807, the Colcord brothers, from Bangor, put up a saw mill and grist mill ; and similar mills are still in operation there. The first settler was Byley Lyford, who called the first town-meeting on a warrant issued by N. R. Lowney, Esq. In 1820, Oliver Crosby, one of the two principal proprietors, moved into town and commenced farming on a large scale; holding for his own use 700 acres. His buildings were large and elegant, his orchard and grounds adjoining were laid out in a tasteful manner, and his farming was skilful and successful. Mr. Crosby was a native of Billeriea, Massachusetts, and a member of the bar in that commonwealth. He reared a large family ; of whom two at least have been widely known and esteemed, \u2014 the late William C. Crosby of Bangor, and Hon. Josiah Crosby of Dexter. There are a Methodist and a Free Baptist church in the town. Atkinson has a school fund of $2,000 arising mainly from the sale of land reserved for educational purposes. It has ten public school houses, valued at $4,000. The valuation in 1870 was $234,271, In 1880, it was $180,902. The population in 1870 was 810. By t-ie census of 1880, it was 828. AllOlirn, the shire town of Androscoggin lies on the west side of Androscoggin River opposite Lewiston. Durham bounds if on the south-east, New Gloucester on the south-west, Poland lies west of the middle portion, Minot, on the north-west and Turner on the north. It is upwards of 12 miles in length, 6 miles above the falls on the Andros coggin and 6 below, and having an average width of about 4^ miles. Its area is something over 50 square miles, about one-sixth of which is covered by its two larger ponds. The Indians formerly had a fort on the high ground at the junction of the two rivers, which was destroyed by Major Church in 1690. It is stated in one of the published1 accounts of this expedition, that a number of Indians ran out of the fort toward the falls as Church's men entered it from the side next the Little Androscoggin. The white men followed after, but lost sight of"], [90, "82 Gj-IZETTEER OF MAINE. them near the falls. At length they were led to suppose that the savages were hidden behind the falling sheet of water, and discharged their guns into it. when the body of an Indian was seen floating away over the boiling waters, staining them with blood. Traces of their cornfields were formerly observed on the plain above and westward of the falls, and several skeletons have been exhumed in the vicinity of Goff's Block. The skeletons were generally in a sitting posture with wampum and their war clubs in their hands. The Little Androscoggin crosses the middle of the town from the west to the larger river. About one-fourth of a mile from its mouth it descends 70 feet in a short distance, furnishing a water power equal to 2,870 horse .power, or 114,800 spindles. About 2\u00a3 miles above this there is a descent over ledges where 20 feet head could be obtained, which would yield about 800 horse power, or 33,600 spindles. The outlets of Auburn Lake, Little Wilson Pond, Auburn Lake and Taylor Pond also furnish powers, several of which are improved by saw and grist mills, On the lower fall of the Little Androscoggin is a cotton mill of about 20,000 spindles, called the Barker Mill, and another is contemplated. At the outlet of Lake Auburn is a peg, saw, grist and box mills, and a fur- niture factory. This pond is 4 miles long and 2 wide, its area being about 1,968 acres. It is a beautiful sheet of water, and is becoming quite a pleasure resort. There are numerous boats, and one or :more small steamers at the service of pleasure parties, and two or more ihotels furnish comfortable entertainment. Auburn mineral spring is -near by. The face of the country at a little distance from the river is \u2022generally elevated, and good roads wind among the hills and valleys .and the small tracts of woodland, and past neat farm houses and thrifty .farms, affording many agreeable drives. The four princijjal villages are known as Auburn, West, North, and East Auburn. There were in January, 1880, fourteen large shoe factories in town. \u2022\"One of these is at West Auburn, another at North Auburn, and the remainder at the principal village, at the falls of the Androscoggin. These factories give employment to upwards of 2,000 persons, includ- ing both sexes, young and old. The amount of capital employed in the shoe business is about $1,000,000, and the annual payroll is about $630,000. The number of cases of boots and shoes made in 1879 was 6.7,334 ; their value being $3,750,000. The number of pounds of leather -received during the year was 5,530,842. In 1880 the shoe product ifif the city was carried up to four and a half million pairs, an increase of 500,000 pairs over 1879. The Barker Mill, manufacturing cotton cloth, in 1880 increased its product 200,000 yards above that of the previous year, bringing the figures up to 4,000,000 yards. In addition to the manufactures already mentioned are a large tannery, a \u25a0last .'factory, a shoe-findings factory, the workshop of the Auburn Valve (Company, including a brass foundry and a machine shop, a box fac nory, making shoe and other boxes, a carriage and sleigh factory, a ilarge brick yard, a paper box factory, and several other lesser manu factories. The capital employed in other manufactures is equal to that in the shoe business, and the annual product is about $400,000. The total value of manufactures in Auburn for 1878 was $4,100,000. It was larger in 1879, and will probably be larger still in 1880. The number of females employed in the shoe manufacture is given at 589; and in"], [91, "AUBURN. 83 manufacturing of all kinds, 800. The number of males employed in the shoe business is stated at 1,508 ; and in manufacturing of all kinds, 1,700. The total number of persons employed in manufactories in town is about 2,500. Auburn has two savings banks and two national banks. The Grand Trunk railroad has a branch (Lewiston and Auburn Railroad) passing through the middle of the town, while the Maine Central passes through northward, sending branches up and down the river, by which easy connection is furnished to all parts of the State. There are many fine residences about the villages ; the height on the west of the city being notable for these and for its charming views along both rivers. Auburn is lighted by gas from the Barker Mill, and from the Lewiston Gas Light Company ; and an aqueduct furnishes spring water to the houses. The high school building (formerly the Edward Little Institute, and earlier, the Lewiston Falls Academy) is a handsome edifice of brick, in a fine situation. In the school grounds in front of this building is a fine statue in bronze of Judge Little, the principal benefactor of the old Lewiston Falls Academy. The statue is by Simmons. It occupies an eminent position, and is an elegant addition to the vicinity. The city has for several years sustained a system of graded school, which re ceived the earnest support of the inhabitants. The county building, containing the court-room and offices, is a handsome building of brick, was erected in 1856-7, at a cost of about $100,000. Adjoining is the county jail and workshop, also of brick. Near by is an excellent two story building of brick, built by the city for the accommodation of its government. Hon. C. W. Walton, formerly representative in the national Congress, nOw a popular judge of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine resides in Auburn. In the early period of the town the titles were conflicting. When incorporated, it included a large part of Bakerstown (now Poland), Minot, and only the northern half of what is now Auburn. The whole of this territory was first incorporated as the town of Poland, in 1795. In 1802 that part now Minot and a part of the present Auburn was set off. The two were sejiarated, and Auburn incorporated in 1842. In 1859, the small portion of Danville lying north of the Little Andros coggin River was annexed to Auburn. In 1867, the remainder of the town of Danville was annexed. Its name still lingers in the minor village of Danville Junction, and the post offices of West Danville and Danville Comers. In 1868 Auburn was incorporated as a city. The General Court of Massachusetts in 1736 made a grant of a township of land to certain officers and soldiers as pay for their ser vices in an expedition to Canada under captains John March, Stephen Greenhall and Philip Nelson, in 1690. The first township assigned them under the name of Bakerstown was found to be in New Hamp shire, and on their petition another was granted them of seven and a half miles square, occupying in part the present city of Auburn, \u2014 the location not to interfere with the Pejepscot claim or the town of New Gloucester.' It having been found that there was an interference with the former, a new location was ordered, and Mr. Amos Davis was ap pointed to make the survey at the expense of the proprietors, which was done. Two years later it was discovered that the new location also was wrong ; and the General Court ordered Davis to revise his"], [92, "84 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. survey. In 1787, the State of Massachusetts sold to John Bridgham and John Glover all the land belonging to that commonwealth lying between the towns of New Gloucester, Gray, Otisfield and Shepherd field (now Hebron and Oxford), and appointed Samuel Titcomb to survey the same. As surveyed by him, the tract included all of Bakerstown, excepting about 1,100 acres. There was also the settler's claim ; so that Colonel Moses Little (who had been the agent of the Bakestown proprietors from the first) found it neither a small nor a pleasant matter to secure what he deemed to be his rights. Finally he held his own against later giants, while Massachusetts purchased of the Pejepscot proprietors that portion of their territory which she had given to the Bakerstown proprietors. Colonel Little's son Josiah succeeded him in the management of his lands in Maine, which included a large extent of Bakerstown and of the Pejepscot Patent. Josiah's son Edward became his successor in respect to the Maine lands, and eventually became a resident of the vicinity of Lewiston Falls. Here he was active in all public affairs, and was a chief mover in the formation of the first Congregational church in this place. In 1835, he and eleven others became the cor porators of Lewiston Falls Academy, \u2014 to which Mr. Little gave nine acres of land in a suitable location as a site for the school. He also contributed to erecting the building, and later, gave to the institution a new house and a large lot valued at that time at $3,000. West Auburn village is, situated upon a broad elevated ridge on the west side of Auburn Lake, about 5 miles from Lewiston Falls. It was settled in 1789. The first meeting-house in town was erected at this place in 1805. During the lifetime of Jonathan Scott, the first minister, it was occupied exclusively by the Congregationalists. After his death in 1819, the house was used by the Baptists and Universalists, also, according to the amount owned in it by each. East Auburn situated about 3 miles from the Falls, at the outlet of Lake Auburn, was settled in 1797, by William Briggs. The first grist mill in town was built at this place before 1793, when a saw mill was built. A second grist mill was built in 1799. The first Baptist meet ing-house was built in 1819. The first school was taught by Daniel Briggs in 1798. The southern portion of the present city of Auburn was incorporated in 1802 as the town of Pejepscot. It was included in the Pejepscot purchase, except a gore of about 4,000 acres, sometimes called the Little Gore. In 1819 its name was changed to Danville. In 1852 it re ceived a small addition of territory from the eastern part of Poland. Later the whole was absorbed in Auburn, as has been stated. The first settlement in Pejepscot is reputed to have been by one family in 1764, and the Gore in 1777 by James Wagg, from Brighton, England. Mr. Rowe came in from Cape Ann in 1780. Thomas Bailey built a saw mill on the Little Androscoggin River in 1780. It has been known as Nason's mill ; and it supplied the inhabitants with lumber for 52 years. Hon. Robert Martin, born in New Gloucester in 1800, came into Poland \u2014 now Auburn \u2014 in 1809 with his parents, and settled on the place he now occupies. He has therefore lived in two states, two counties, three towns, and one city, without change of residence. In the war of the Rebellion, Auburn sent into the army of the Union 430 real flesh and blood men, and also paid for 5 \" paper men.\""], [93, "INSANE HOSPITAL, AUGUSTA, ME."], [94, "86 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. All these real men were obtained by voluntary enlistment except 15 who were drafted. Of the 15 drafted, 4 entered the service, 4 fur nished substitutes, and 7 paid each $300 commutation money. Seven residents of Auburn enlisted in the navy. Of the whole number fur nished by Auburn, only 13 are known to have been killed in battle, but there were some missing after battles who have never been accounted for. One man lost a leg another an arm. Twenty died while in the army, or soon after getting home, of disease contracted in the army. The town paid in bounty money $62,365.60 for enlistments, and to drafted men $2,376,91. The portion of Auburn which was then Danville, sent into the army, according to the Adjutant-General's re port, 148 men. Auburn has in the central village, Baptist, Free Baptist, Congrega tional, Methodist and Universalist churches, three or more of them being imposing edifices. A public library in the city has about 4,000 volumes. The number of public school-houses in town is twenty eight. The estimated value of the school property is $86,200. The total amount of money actually expended for schools by the city in the in the year commencing April 1, 1878 to April 1, 1879, was $13,507. The valuation of estates in Auburn in 1870, was $2,918,101. In 1880 it was $5,099,446. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 17\u00a3 mills on a dollar. The population at the same date was 6,169 ; in 1880, 9,568. The city has two national and two savings banks. A news paper called the \" Greenback Labor Chronicle \" has been published in the city for a few years. Its publishers have recently changed. Its day of publication is Thursday. (See Lewiston.) Allg'llStct, the capital of the State and shire town of Ken nebec County, is situated upon both sides of the Kennebec River, its north-western part being near the centre of the county of Kennebec. The towns of Sidney and Vassalboro form its northern boundary, Windsor, the eastern, Chelsea and Hallowell the southern and Man chester the western. The territory extends about 10 miles from east to west, and 6 from north to south. Its principal streams are Kennebec River, Bond Brook, and Woromontogus Stream. The pond of the same name in the eastern part of the town, is the largest of the ponds, containing If square miles. Others are Three-cornered Pond, Spectacle, Dam, Tolman, Greely, Little Togus, and several smaller. The surface of the town is uneven, but there are no high hills. The underlying rock is granite. The soil is productive, andthe town has long been noted for the excellence of its agriculture, and the fine qual ity of its domestic animals. There is but one village. The Maine Centra] (formerly Kennebec and Portland) railroad follows the river on the west side from Brunswick to the principal station, then crosses the river diagonally on a graceful iron bridge, and ascends on the east side. The two parts of the town are also connected by a free bridge 450 feet in length. It is of wood, but of large timbers well put to gether, and kept in the best repair. The chief manufactures of Augusta are cotton cloths, lumber, sash, doors and blinds, window-shades, excelsior steam engines, railroad cars, stone cutters' tools, shoes, butter-salt, box-tubing, cemetery monuments, furniture, flour and meal, etc. Water is the principal motive power, but three or more factories use steam power. The"], [95, "KEMNEBEC DAM, AUGUSTA, ME."], [96, "88 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. water-power is furnished by E .d's Brook, which enters the Kennebec at this place, and from a fall of 15 feet in the Kennebec, which forms the head of the tide. The volume of water passing the fall, as measured in 1866, was 175,000 cubic feet per minute for the mean run through the summer. The Freeman's National Bank, in this city, has a capital stock of $100,000. The capital of the Granite National Bank is $150,000. Augusta Savings Bank at the commencement of the fiscal year of 1880, held in deposits and profits, $2,877,529,41. The Kennebec Savings Bank held at the same time $334,644,73. Several newspapers and weekly journals are published at Augusta. Of these, the \" Maine Farmer,\" \" Gospel Banner,\" and \" Kennebec Journal\" are the oldest, and each is excellent in its department. The last has also a daily edition throughout the year. The two first are neutral in politics, the latter republican. The \" Home Farm \" is a new eight page paper, devoted, as its name indicates, to the improvement and profit of the home and farm. It is an attractive sheet for a small price, and is published weekly by Boardman and Hall. The leading democratic paper is the \" Augusta Age.\" Others are the popular \" People's Literary Companion,\" published weekly by E. C. Allen & Co., and devoted chiefly to stories ; the \" Illustrated Family Herald,\" which has some very good points, \u2014 published monthly by True & Co.; the \" Fireside Visitor,\" a pleasing paper for the winter evenings, another monthly, published by P. O. Vickery ; the \" Illustrated Monthly,\" and \"Illustrated Family Magazine, \u2014 jmblished monthly by Shaw & Co., \u2014 both excellent in their way. The public buildings of Augusta are the State House, an imposing edifice of white granite, on a commanding site; the State Insane Asylum, the county court-house and the jail, both of granite, \u2014 the litter of an elegant architecture. Among the handsome private build ings are Ft. Catherine's Hall (the building of the Episcopal School), the Augusta House, Granite Block, Meionaon Hall, and several notable private dwelling-houses. The finest business edifices in the city are those constituting the publishing establishment of E. C. Allen & Co., illustrations of which are given. The main building is hand some and very substantially built. Its ground dimensions are 65 by 53 feet. The addition \u2014 completed a few months since \u2014 is of equal size and height. It is constructed of granite, brick and iron, the walls being two feet thick. Though over 100 tons of rapid machinery are in it, yet scarcely the slightest tremor can be perceived. Each story is supplied with a fire apparatus, and sufficient water can be instantly turned on to extinguish any fire that can originate in the building. A steam elevator runs from the bottom to the top capable of carrying a load of five tons from the first floor to the sixth story in thirty seconds. The buildings contain sixteen presses; seven of which are Hoe's largest and most rapid machines, being capable of printing over five tons of paper daily. In these buildings are also composing rooms, a bindery and a superior electrotype foundery. The machinery is run by three engines, one of which is a Corliss machine weighing some 50,000 pounds, and costing $10,000. The cost of the buildings and machinery has been about $300,000. Nearly 500 persons are employed in with this establishment. The steam whistle upon the top of the extension, which calls the employes to their labor and releases them from it, is sounded"], [97, "THE PUBLISHING HOUSE OF E. C.

Handsome shade trees of all sizes and ages adorn the streets, and groups and even groves of them are here and there seen clustering about some ancient mansion. The village of Augusta occupies the successive terraces on each side of the river, so that the business portions are little above the surface of the river, while others seem at an almost mountainous elevation. That part of the city proper lying on the western bank of the river is supplied with water by two aqueducts, \u2014 one of them fed wholly by boiling springs. The upper terraces along the river are regarded as very healthy localities. There are many persons living the city who are between eighty- and ninety years of age, and some above the latter age. Among the objects of interest in the town is a portion of old Fort Western, on the east side of the river, a short distance below the bridge. This was built in 1754 by the proprietors of the Plymouth pur chase, to whom the ownership of the grant of territory to the Ply mouth colony had finally come. This grant was made to the Plymouth colony, North Virginia (or New England) Company in 1629. They immediately made use of it for the fur trade; and as early as 1629 had erected a trading house at Cushnoc \u2014 now Augusta. A powerful sub tribe of the Canibas Indians then resided in the vicinity. In the second Indian war all the improvements on the river were laid waste After the peace of 1713, a stone fort, said to be the strongest then in the country, was built under the direction of Dr. Noyes. The succeeding wars again devastated the place ; and so little was left of the stone fort that Fort Western was constructed wholly of wood. Though in 1675 there were reckoned to be 100 inhabitants on the Kennebec \u2014 many of whom must have been at Cushnoc \u2014 the place was desolate so many years that James Howard, who commanded Fort Western, is con sidered by local historians as the first settler. Others of the early set tlers were James Page and Moses Greely, Ephraim Cowan and Daniel Hilton, Williams, Hamlin, Sewall, Titcomb, Bridge, Fuller, Robin son, Flagg, Cony, Stone, Ingraham, Dillingham, Smith, North, Savage, Church, Rice, Gage, Chandler, Emery, and Dorr. The place was incorporated as a part of Hallowell in 1771, but was set off and in corporated under the name of Harrington in 1797, the change to the present name (Augusta) being made the same year. It became the shire town of the county in 1798, and the capital of the State in 1828. The capitol was finished in 1832, the Insane Asylum in 1840, and the corner stone of the Arsenal was laid in June, 1828. The dam of the river at this point was completed in 1838, and the first cotton mill erected in 1845. In 1849, Augusta was incorporated as a city, Alfred Reddington being the first mayor. Subsequent mayors have been J. A. Pettengill, Samuel Cony, Joseph W. Patterson, Albert G. Dole, James W. North, Sylvanus Caldwell, Wm. T. Johnson, Daniel Wil liams, Samuel Titcomb, J. J. Eveleth, Daniel A. Cony, and Chas. E. Nash, and Peleg O. Vickery. Many eminent persons have been natives or residents of Augusta. Hon. Reuel Williams, a native and resident, was twice chosen a mem ber of the national Senate. Luther Severance, founder of the \" Ken nebec Journal,\" served with marked ability as representative in Con gress. Hon. James W. Bradbury, a native of Parsonsfield, but a resi-"], [100, "92 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. dent of Augusta for about fifty years, has filled with ability prominent positions under the State government, served a term in the national Senate. Lot M. Morrill, formerly governor of the State and national Senator, became a resident in early manhood. Hon. James G. Blaine, became a resident when a young man, represented the district in Con gress for several terms, and served as speaker of the House with dis tinguished ability. He was one of the principal candidates for the presidency of the nation in 1876, and was in the same year elected to the Senate. Hon. R. D. Rice, formerly a judge of the Supreme Court of the State, was a resident of Augusta. Among present eminent citizens are Hon. Artemus Libby, a judge of the same court, Hon. James W. North, historian and, for several terms, mayor of the city ; Hon. William P. Whitehouse, judge of the Superior Court; Hon. Joseph II. Williams, once governor of Maine; Hon. John L. Stevens, formerly minister to Paraguay and later minister resident at Stockholm ; and Hon. Selden Connor, a brigadier-gen eral in the war of the Rebellion, and governor of Maine for three terms. Edward Stanwood, Esq., managing editor of the \"Boston Advertiser,\" was a native of this town. Augusta sent about 1,000 men into the army during the war of the Rebellion, of whom some 200 were lost. Their monument consists of a bronze figure of Liberty mounted upon a granite pedestal. Upon the faces of the latter are bronze dies representing the career of the volunteer soldier, and bronze emblems of State and Nation. The total height of the monument is about forty-eight feet. The leading denominations all have church edifices, and sustain regular preaching. The granite church of the Congregationalists is a noble building and occupies ample and attractive grounds. The de nomination sustained meetings long before there was a church edifice in town. The educational facilities of the city are supplied by the Dirigo Business College, and a graded system of public schools. The school houses belonging to the city number 33, and are valued at $55,000. The valuation of Augusta in 1870 was $4,881,135. In 1880 it was $5,168,964. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 21 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 7,808. In 1880 it had increased to 8,667. AlirOl'tl is situated on a branch of Union River, in the northern part of Hancock county. It is on the \" Air Line \" road, 24 miles from Ellsworth, and 25 from Bangor. The territory is six miles square, giving an area of 23,040 square miles. Its soil is a gravelly loam, and can be worked earlier in the spring than than that of any other town on Union River. Wheat is the principal crop. The pre vailing rock is a coarse granite, which is decomposed by infiltration, and is used to \"gravel\" the highways. Spruce Mountain is the greatest eminence. In the eastern part of the town is one of those alluvial ridges known as \" horsebacks,\" bearing the name of Whale's Back. The \" Air Line \" road passes over it for a distance of 3i miles. The longest bridge in town \u2014 100 feet \u2014 is of stone. The roads run over the hardwood hills, which were principally occupied by the first settlers, and afford pleasant views. The woods are generally of pine, spruce and hemlock. The \" Middle Branch Ponds \" are about a mile in length by half a mile in width."], [101, "BAILEYVILLE. 93 Aurora was one of the \" Lottery Townships,\" and was organized as Plantation No. 27 in 1822, and incorporated as a town in 1831. Its name is from the mythological name for morning. Its first settlers were four brothers, Samuel, Benjamin, David and Roswell Silsby, who took up their abode in the township in 1805. Aurora furnished 27 soldiers in the war for the Union, paying bounties to the amount of $1,983. There are two public schoolhouses, one of which is of brick ; both having the value of $600. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $32,052. In 1880, it is $41,953. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 19 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 212. In the census of 1880, it was 218. AVOll is a central town in the southern part of Franklin County- Phillips bounds it on the north, Strong on the east, Weld on the west? and Temple on the south. The form of the town is nearly square, having an angle toward the N.N.E. Across this northern part, nearly from west to east, runs Sandy River. At the south-west corner of the town, with its precipitous southern front in Temple, stands Mount Blue, whose summit is 2,804 feet above the ocean. Near it, at the north-west, is Little Blue Mountain. From Mount Blue a line of peaks extend eastward, decreasing in height until it terminates in the steep bluff of Stubb's Mountain, forcing a right angle in the course of Sandy River. Spruce Mountain is also in this line. South of Stubb's is Day's Mountain, also on the border of the town. Temple Stream rises on the southern slope of the range. Solitary eminences in other parts of the town bear the names of Bald Hill, which rests on the north western angle ; Phillip's Hill, south of the former ; and Sylvester Hill, E.S.E. of the last. By the side of Sylvester Hill is the principal pond in the town. There is no considerable village, and the nearest post offices are those in Strong and Phillips, not far from the town border. There are two saw mills in the town, manufacturing all kinds of house timber, plank, boards, joists, clapboards and shingles. Avon is 15 miles north-west of Farmington. The Narrow Gauge railroad from the latter town to Phillips passes throwgh Avon. The surface of the town is very uneven in the southern part. The principal forest trees are maple, white birch, poplar and spruce. The principal crop for market is hay. Avon was settled soon after the Revolution, the first settlers being Captain Joshua Soule and Captain Perkins Allen. These were soon followed by Moses Dudley, Ebenezer Thompson, Mark Whitten, Thomas Humphrey, Charles Dwelley, and Samuel and Jesse Ingraham. The town was incorporated in 1802. Avon has eleven public school houses ; and the school property is valued at $2,200. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $149,693. In 1880, it was $149,347. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 5 mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 610. In 1880, it was 571.

It is bounded on the south by Baring, west by Princeton, and east by New Bruns-"], [102, "94 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. wick. In dimensions it is about 15 miles in length north and south along the river, and about 4 miles in width. The St. Croix and Pen obscot railroad, connecting with Calais, runs across it from north-east to south-west. The southern part of the town is 35 miles north of Machias, on the stage-line from that place to Calais. There is a bridge across the St. Croix here about 200 feet in length. The principal sheet of water in the town is Robbin's Pond, having an area of about 1 acre. Wapskehagan Mountain is the greatest ele vation of land, having an altitude of about 300 feet. The rock in the town is granitic in character. The soil is divided between clay and gravelly loam. Oats, wheat, potatoes, yield good crops. Trees of hemlock, beech and gray birch constitute most of the forests. William Anderson and Richard Lawler were prominent and esteemed citizens of Baileyville. Hon. William Delesdernier once re sided for some time in this town. The principal religious society in town is the Baptist. Baileyville has six public schoolhouses, and expends about $700 per year in support of schools. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $53,641. In 1880 it was $53,061. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 3 per cent. The population in 1870 was 377. In 1880 it was 376. Btliley Vllle, a small village in Winthrop, Kennebec County. B&ldwill is situated on the south-western shore of Lake Sebago, and constitutes the south-western corner of Cumberland County. The town of Sebago bounds it on the north, Standish on the east and south-east ; Hiram, in Oxford C> unty, on the west ; and Cor nish and Limington, in York County, on the south. The Saco river, in a curving line, forms almost the entire western, south-western and southern boundary-line. Saddle-back Mountain is the principal emi nence, being about 2,000 feet in height. It affords fine views of Sebago Lake, its islands, and distant shores, with other ponds and mountains. Upon it is a striking precipitous rock, 300 or 400 feet in perpendicular height. The surface of the town is considerably broken, but the soil is favorable to the growth of grass and grain. Much attention is paid to the cultivation of fruit. At East Baldwin there has recently been put in operation a factory for drying apples. There is also a corn factory at this place which does considerable business. The stock-farm of Colonel Mattocks is an establishment of much value to the town, and of interest to visitors. Baldwin has several small bodies of water, none exceeding half a square mile in extent. The largest are Sand, Ingalls and Half-Moon ponds. Quaker, Dug Hill and Break Neck brooks, respectively at the southern, middle and northern parts of the town, next Saco, furnish power for one or more board, stave and shook mills, each; and there is a fine power on the Saco, called \" Highland Fall,\" at about the middle of the north line of Limington adjoining. West Baldwin and, at the south, Baldwin Corner, are the principal villages. Along near the Saco river, for the whole length of the town, runs the Portland and Ogdensburg railway. At Baldwin Station this connects with stages for Cornish, Kezer Falls, Porter and Freedom \u2014 the latter in New Hampshire. At East Baldwin there is a flag station, and at West Baldwin is a telegraph office."], [103, "BANGOR. 95 The township of Baldwin, together with that of Sebago, was granted in 1774 to the survivors of Captain Flint's company, of Con cord, Mass. The town was incorporated in 1802, being named in honor of Loammi Baldwin, one of the early settlers. It had previously been called Flintstown, for the leader of the company before men tioned. Something was done for the establishment of religion and edu cation as early as 1800, but religious meetings were not frequent or permanent until some twenty-four years later, when Rev. Noah Emer son was settled as pastor of the Congregational Church. At the same time, the Methodists formed themselves into a society, and claimed a part of the ministerial fund of the town, but the court decided adversely to them. Each of these denominations, also the Baptist, has its church edifice \u2014 the Congregationalists at East Baldwin, and the Methodist at West Baldwin. The town has twelve public school houses, valued at $2,700. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $256,225. In 1880 it was $312,101. The rate of taxation in 1880 was about 1^ per cent. The population in 1870 was 1,101. By the census in 1880 it was 1,123. Bancroft Plantation is situated in the south-eastern part of Aroostook county, 30 miles south-south-east of Houlton. The township is irregular, but about 6 miles square. The Matta wamkeag runs through the township in a general north-east to south west course; receiving on its way Brattle Brook, Baskahegan Stream, and Hawkins Brook. The European and North American Railway runs across the southern part of the township, having a station at Ban croft village in the south-eastern part. The principal occupations of the people are farming and lumbering. The forests have the usual varieties of woods. Kelly Hill is the princi pal eminence, having an altitude of about 1,000 feet. The soil is loamy in some parts and sandy in others. Hay, wheat, oats and potatoes yield good crops. The first settlement was by- Charles Gellerson, from Brighton, Me., in 1830. The plantation was organized in 1840 \u2014 being named in honor of George Bancroft, the historian. The Methodist denomination is the only one that has a church in the plantation. There is a public library of about 100 volumes. There are three public school-houses ; these, with other school property being valued at $1,000. The valua tion of estates in 1870 was $35,093. In 1880, it was $48,961. The rate of taxation in the latter year was one cent on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 177. In 1880, it was 247. Bailg'Or is situated in the southern part of Penobscot County, on the Penobscot River, about 60 miles from the sea and 30 from the head of the bay, and has a harbor deep enough to float the largest vessels. It is 250 miles from Boston and 140 miles from Portland. It is the shire town and the only city in the county. It stretches along the bank for six miles, and has an area of about 20,000 acres. The surface of the town is generally uneven. The city proper occupies the shores of the Kenduskeag and the western bank of tho Penobscot at the junction of the two rivers. The latter river forms the south-western boundary, separating it from Brewer, while the"], [104, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 96 course of the Kenduskeag through the town is from the north-north west. The outcropping and underlying rocks are mostly slate. The soil is clayey loam, with small areas of gravelly loam, while there is gener ally a hard pan of clay ; so that much of the land is relieved of water only by thorough drainage. The water power of Bangor is a marked feature. On the Penobscot, one mile above the harbor proper, is \" Treat's Falls,\" where in the dryest time, besides the quantity required in the sluice for the passage of rafts of timber, there is available about 2,000 feet of water per second for manufacturing purposes. It is believed that by the proposed dam of 15 feet, and flash-boards, the amount of flowage available in the dryest time may be raised to 9,000 horse-powers. On the Kenduskeag the powers are, \u2014 first, \" Drummond's Mills,\" McQues tion's Mills,\" \" Brace's Mills,\" \" Hatch's Mills,\" \" The Four Mile Falls\" and \" Six Mile Falls.\" The power of this series may be apprehended by the fact that Brace's Mills could saw 2,500,000 to 3,000,000 feet of boards annually. Bangor stands midway between the great Maine forests and the sea. Her vessels span the latter, while her rivers gather in their branches, and bring down the vast product of forest and mills from a wide belt extending nearly across the State. The booms to hold the logs extend for miles along the river. Up to 1855, there had been 2,999,847,201 feet of lumber surveyed at Bangor ; be tween 1859 and 1869,1,869,965,454 feet of long lumber were shipped hence ; in 1868, 274,000,000 feet of short lumber (clapboards, laths and shingles) were shipped ; and in 1872, there were 246,500,000 feet of long lumber surveyed here. The total lumber crop of Maine in 1872 was about 700,000,000 feet of which 225,000,000 floated down the Penob scot. To transport these vast amounts of lumber to its markets, hun dreds of vessels must ascend this great thoroughfare of Maine, the lordly Penobscot. As might be supposed, many industries dependent or connected with the lumber business flourish here. There are one or more saw and water-wheel manufactures, three iron foundries, two brass foun dries, three machine shops; edge-tool, belting and boiler factories, ship-yards, a door, sash and blind factory, seven barrel factories, five brick-yards, a coffee and spice mill, four boot and shoe factories, three carriage factories, a broom and brush factory, etc. Besides the lumber manufactures within her own borders, Bangor is the common shipping-place for the numerous mills and quarries up the river and its branches, and has therefore extensive exports of lumber, roofing slate and agricultural products. The city is reckoned the second lumber mart of the world. Besides her coastwise business, she has a large commerce with the West Indies and European ports; there are large entries as well as clearances at her custom house. No other city of New England is the trade centre of so large a number of rural towns as Bangor. The head of navigation in winter is at Bucks port, about 18 miles south, \u2014 with which Bangor is connected by the Bucksport and Bangor railroad. The city is connected with the southern interior and south-western portion of the State by means of the Maine Central railroad and its branches ; with the central section of the State, embracing the slate region of southern Piscataquis County, by the Bangor and Piscataquis railroad ; with the eastern, north and south-eastern parts and with New Brunswick and the St."], [105, "BANGOR. 97 Lawrence valley by the European and North American railway; with Mount Desert and intermediate points, and with Portland, Boston and New York, by steamboat lines ; and with the surrounding regions by stage routes. Bangor is a central point of departure for Mount Desert, the Provinces, and Katahdin and the Maine Wilderness. Naturally, under such conditions, much wealth would accumulate in the hands of prudent citizens, and such we find to be the case with Bangor. The numerous banks, the fine residences, the finished ap pearance of the city, and the style of living show it. The land gradu ally rises from the rivers, affording fine views from several points, especially from Thomas Hill, on the west side. Just at the shore of the Penobscot there are level spaces, whereon stands most of the busi ness portion of the city ; but as it recedes from the larger river, the Kenduskeag forms a deep ravine, in which from the Valley Road, and still within the compass of the city proper, are to be seen steep, woody banks and wild, almost insurmountable precipices. The heights on either side of the stream are lined with streets well-shaded with noble elms, and have many handsome residences. There are here, also, many churches of good architecture and construction. In the business part of the city are many massive and substantial buildings, conspicuous among which are Norombega Hall, a large wooden building resting on piles in the midst of the Kenduskeag. The lower part of this building is used for a market, while in the upper part is a hall capable of seating 2,000 persons. Opposite, on a bridge across the river, is the United States building, containing the Customs and Post Offices, \u2014 a neat structure of granite. Near by, in the broad, deep, quiet stream of the Penobscot, anchor the largest as well as the smallest ships, bearing the flags of all the great maritime nations; while beside them, floating down with the current, may be a great raft of logs or of sawed lumber, come down from the Upper Penobscot for a market or the mills. The locality of Bangor seemed to attract the early voyagers of the French, Dutch, Spanish and English nations. As early as 1539 it was spoken of under the name \"Norombega,\" and was thought to be the site of a famous city of that name. The name is perpetuated by the principal hall of the city. Later it was known as Kenderquit, Con deskeag, and Kenduskeag ; and in 1769, it was \"Kenduskeag Planta tion.\" The earliest record preserved in the archives of the city, is dated March 27, 1787. The aboriginal inhabitants of the region were known to the English as the Tarratines. Their principal seat in the vicinity was near what is now known as the Red Bridge, near Treat's Falls, where, later, was the business quarter of the early settlers. The first post-office of the town was here (established in 1800), and the post-master was Major Treat, from whom the falls have their name. Jacob Bussell, Buzzell, or Buswell, from Salisbury, Mass.,. was the first settler ; removing his family to the place in 1769. At this time there had been born to him nine children. His son; Stephen Bussell, with his wife, Lucy Grant, and Caleb Goodwin with his wife and eight children, from Castine, followed in 1770. In 1771--2, the settlement comauied twelve families, many of them from Woolwich and Brunswick, Maine. The first physician who practiced in Bangor was John Herbert, in 1774. From this time until 1779, Dr. Herbert led the meetings as exhorter, and taught school in the plantation. 7"], [106, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 98 In 1799 and 1800, to make up a deficiency in the lands held under the Waldo patent, the General Court assigned the township to General Knox, one of the proprietors of the patent, reserving, however, 113 lots of 100 acres each to the settlers. In 1779, a portion of the broken fleet of Commodore Ssltonstall was pursued and captured at the mouth of the Kenduskeag; but the victors appear not to have harmed the inhabitants. In 1814, however, Bangor was taken possession of by a British force, ten vessels were burned ; stores, offices and deserted dwellings were pillaged ; and the inhabitants wei? rudely, and in some cases, outrageously treated. In 1791, having acquiredt 576 inhabi- tants, the plantation, through its representative, the Rev. Seth Noble, procured from the General Court an act of incorporation. They had chosen for it the name, Sunbury, as being descriptive of the attractive appearance of the place ; but when the speaker called for the name of his town, Mr. Noble replied, \"Bangor,\" \u2014 which was the name of his favorite tune, \u2014 and this accidently or otherwise became the name of the town. It was first represented in the General Court in 1806, by James Thomas. The first bridge over the Kenduskeag was built in 1807, at a cost of $4,000 ; the Bangor Bridge Company was incorpor ated in 1828; and the first bridge over the Penobscot was completed -by them in 1832. It was 440 yards in length, and -cost $50,000. A portion of this was carried away by the great freshet of 1846, and was rebuilt in 1847. The court-house was built in 1812. Peter Edes established the first printing press in 1815; and near the close of the same year he began the publication of the first newspaper, named the \"Bangor Weekly Register.\" He died in Bangor, March 29, 1839, aged eighty-three years, being at that time the oldest printer in the United States. The Bangor Theological Seminary received its char- ter in 1814. It was at first located at Hampden (1816), and bore the name of \"Maine Charity School ; \" but in 1819 it was removed to Bangor. A classical school was connected with it for several years. The buildings front on a broad, grassy slope in the highest part of the city. It has five professors, about 000 alumni, and a library of 14,000 volumes. An academy was established in 1817, and the first bank in 1818. Bangor received her city charter in 1834, \u2014 the first mavor being Allen Gilman. The business of the place increased rapidly in 1833-4, and there was much speculation. In common with other parts of the country the business of Bangor received a severe check, but by 1840 it had mostly recovered. Since the latter date the busi- ness and growth of the city have been steadily augmenting. Bangor became a port of entry in 1847, and the custom house was built in 1 853-6. The Bangor Orphan Asylum was organized in 1839. By the aid of a legacy left by Mrs. Mary F. Pitcher, a larger and more substantial edifice was built, and dedicated in 1809. The Bangor Gas Company was incorporated in 1850, and the Bangor and Piscataquis Slate Com- pany in 1855. The Home for Aged Women w-as incorporated in 1872. The Holly Water-works at Treat's Falls went into operation in July, U876. Among the more distinguished residents of Bangor we should men tion, Francis Carr, member of Congress, in 1811 ;\"james Carr. son of Francis, congressman in 1815; William D. Williamson, governor ol Maine in 1821, later a member of congress, and author of a history of Maine; Hannibal Hamlin, vice-president of the United States with"], [107, "BARING. 99 Lincoln, collector of the port of Boston in 1865, and later United States senator, \u2014 now retired ; Jonathan P. Rogers and George W. Ingersoll, once attorney-generals of the State ; Edward Kent, a former mayor of the city, governor of the State in 1838 and 1840, and jus tice of the Supreme Court from 1859 to 1873 ; G. Parks, a member of Congress and United States minister to Peru ; Elisha H. Allen, United States congressman in 1841-2, since chancellor of the Sandwich Islands, and now representative of the Islands at Washington ; John Appleton, chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court from 1862 to the present time; Charles Stetson, member of congress in 1849-50; Joshua W. Hathaway and Jonas Cutting, justices of the Supreme Court; Samuel F. Hersey, late United States congressman; H. M. Plaisted, once State attorney-general, member of congress in 1875-6, and now governor of the State ; and George W. Ladd, at present a member of Congress. The first settled minister in Bangor was Rev. Seth Noble, who was installed by Rev. Daniel Little under an oak in 1786. He had been with Col. John Allan in Nova Scotia and Machias; and in 1791 represented the Kenduskeag plantation in the General Court. The first meeting house was built in 1788. Mr. Noble was succeeded in 1800 by James Boyd, who resigned the next year. In 1811 Rev. Harvey Loomis was settled, and retained the office until his death in his pulpit in 1825. His successor was Rev. Swan L. Poinroy. A new meeting-house was built in 1821-2, burnt in 1830, and rebuilt in 1831. It cost $12,500 including the organ. The first Unitarian meeting house was built in 1828, and those of the Methodists and Baptists the same year. The religious societies of Bangor are now the Congregationalist, Episcopal, Baptist, Free Baptist, Methodist, Unitarian, Universalist, Christian and Catholic. The first have four church organizations and edifices ; and some of the others have excellent buildings, that of the Catholics being especially noble in its architecture. Bangor 'has one superior high school, and fifty-seven of a lower grade. There are thirty-six public school-houses, which together with their grounds, apparatus, etc., are valued at $125,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $10,036,561. In 1880 it was $8,738,605. The population in 1870 was 18,289. In 1880 it was 16,857. Bar ]\\\u00a3illS, \u2014 a post-office in Buxton and Hollis, York County. Barill J2s is situated in the eastern part of Washington County. On its northern side it adjoins New Brunswick, from which it is separated by the St. Croix river. Calais bounds it on the east, Char lotte on the south, and Meddybemps town and lake on the west. The town is about 6 miles in length, north and south, and about 4 in width. The surface is without high hills, Bunker Hill being the greatest elevation. A gray granite rock forms the ledges which crop out. The soil is clayey. Hay and potatoes are the principal crop. The forest trees are beech, birch, maple, pine, spruce, hemlock and hack matac principally. A few elms have been set along the public ways by considerate and public spirited individuals. The Moosehorn Branch running south to Pemaquan Lake, is the principal stream. A sheet of water called \" Little Lake \" lies in the western part of the town. The centre of business is on the St. Croix, where a dam furnishes a"], [108, "100 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. power carrying several saw mills and other machinery. The manu factures of the town are chiefly of lumber in its various forms. The St. Croix and Penobscot railroad passes through the town and crosses the river into New Brunswick at this point. Baring was incorporated in 1825. The name was probably adopted in honor of the Baring family, of London, a member of which married a daughter of William Bingham, of Philadelphia, who owned immense tracts of land in this and other parts of Maine. The husband of this daughter became Lord Ashburton, who, with the American Secretary of State, Daniel Webster, in 1842, settled our eastern and northern boundary. There are Baptist and Advent societies in the town; and the former has a church and vestry. The Masonic body here have erected a monu ment of Italian marble to those of their members who fell in the Union cause in the Rebellion. Baring has two schoolhouses. The total school property is valued at $500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $96,169. In 1880, it was $76,316. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 21 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 364. In 1880, it was 303. Bar HarbOl*,\u2014 a village and post-office in Eden, Mount Desert Island, Hancock County. Barker's Mills \u2014 a locality m the outskirts of the city of Lewiston, Androscoggin County. Barnard Plantation (No. 6, r. vin)is situated in the southern part of Piscataquis county, having Sebec as its southern boundary. Williamsburg lies on the cast, Bowerbank on the west, and Katahdin Iron Mines in the north. It has a fair quantity of land suit able for farming, and a considerable extent of hemlock, spruce and cedar. Bear Brook and its branches pass through the town southward. On these are a saw and grist-mill, a board and shingle mills and on the west branch a saw-mill. Near this is Egery and William's slate quarry. Slate ledges are numerous, and much of the slate is of su perior quality. There isa great quantity of excellent lumber in town, especially of spruce, hemlock and cedar. Mark Pitman, John Thompson, Benjamin Miller and B. Bunker were the earliest settlers, having come about 1809 or 1810. Barnard was formerly a part of Williamsburg, but was separated from it and in corporated as an independent town in 1834. A large swamp extends between the two towns, forming a division between them. The town of Barnard, by petition of its citizens, was restored to the ) ilantation form in 1877. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $28,753. In 1880 it it was the same. The population in 1870 was 149. In 1880 it was 139. Barter's Island,\u2014 a post office in Boothbay, Lincoln County. Batll is situated on the Kennebec River near the centre of Saga dahoc county, of which it is the shire town. Woolwich and Arrowsie \u2014 both separated from it by the Kennebec \u2014 bound it on the east ; West"], [109, "BATH. 101 Bath, Brunswick, Topsham and Bowdoinham lie on the west, \u2014 the two latter being separated from it by Merrymeeting Bay ; and West Bath and Phipsburg lie on the south. The length of the town along the river from north to south is about 5 miles, and its average width is about 1A- miles. The surface is much broken by low ledgy hills. The principal eminence is North Hill, said to be about 1,000 feet above the level of the sea. Lily and Mill Ponds, each about three fourths of a mile in length, are the principal insulated sheets of water. The rocks are granite and mica schist, and the soil a clay loam. Hay is the largest agricultural product. The forest trees most abundant are beech, birch, pine, spruce and fir. Witch Spring is a mineral spring of some local note. There are three valuable water-powers, \u2014 two on Whiskeag Stream, one of which is a tide power ; and the Winnegance Dam Company's power, lying at the south of the town, between it and Phipsburg. Its capacity is 333 horse power, of which two-thirds belong to the latter town. There are two lumber-mills on Whiskeag Stream, with a capacity of manufacturing about 500,000 feet of lumber annually. On the same stream is a grist-mill with a capacity of grinding 10,000 bushels of grain annually. Other mills are a baryt-rs and a coffee and spice mill. In the northern part of the town, on a point projecting eastward oppo site Lane's Island is Varney's steam saw mill, employing several small vessels in conveying the lumber to market. The chief industry of the city, however, is ship-building; and the product of its yards is of an excellent quality. It is said to be sur passed in the extent of this manufacture only by Boston, New York and Philadelphia, and to excel all in the number of wooden ships built. During the year ending June 30, 1852, there were forty ships, five brigs, and three schooners built here, having an aggregate of 24,339 tons. In 1854 there were fiftv-six ships built, besides thirteen other vessels amounting to 58,454 tons. Following this date there was a great falling off in production. The number of vessels built in 1879 was thirty-five; aggregating 17,383 tons. In 1880, forty-one vessels were built with an aggregate measurement of 22,186 tons. There were launched this year four ships, three barks, two brigs, twenty-six schooners, two steamers and four sloops. The number of vessels now belonging in the U. S. collection district of Bath is 294, with a tonnage of 156,978. The following table gives the product of Bath in this article for the century past, including 1880 : Number. Tonnage.

There are four ice"], [110, "102 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. companies, a steam towage company, etc. The extent of the maritime business of Bath is shown by the arrival during the year previous to June 30, 1880, of 21 vessels \"from foreign ports, and of 1,515 vessels in coastwise business. Bath has connection with Portland and Boston by steamer, and is the terminus of a branch of the Maine Dentral rail road on one hand, and of the Knox and Lincoln connecting with Rock land on the other. The cars of the latter road are conveyed across the river by means of an immense steam ferry boat. Bath is situated on the west bank of the Kennebec, twelve miles from its mouth, but with a safe passage for all the distance, and rarely frozen over. The river is here about half a mile wide, and deep enough for the largest vessels. The compact portion of the city is stretched along the river for about three miles, having an average width of about half a mile. The site of the city is very uneven, but it has several beautiful streets, well shaded with elms, horse-chestnut and plane-trees, and with many handsome residences. There are here a substanital city hallthe county buildings, and a neat government building containing the customs and post offices. The banks are the First National, having a capital of $200,000.; the Bath National, capital, $125,000; Lincoln National, $200,000; Marine National, $100,000 ; and Sadagahoc Nation al, $100,000. The Bath Savings Institution held at the close of the fiscal year in 1879, in deposits and accrued profits, $1,275,600,48 ; the People's Twenty-five Cent Savings Bank, held, at the same date, de posits and accrued profits amounting to $377,154,13. The \"American Sentinel \" is a long established weekly of excellent character, now pub lished by Elijah Upton and Son. The \" Bath Daily Times,\" issued by the same publishers, is a very convenient and reliable sheet ; ar d cred itable alike to its publishers and to the city which it serves. Christopher Lawson, Robert Gutch and Alexander Thwait, were prominent in the early settlement of this town. The first obtained a right to the northerly portion and Lynde's Island at a date probably not earlier than 1640. Thwait and Gutch both obtained their titles of Robin Hood, an Indian sagamore, on May 29, 1C60. Thwait's was that portion extending from Winnegance, at the southern part, to the rope walk, in the city proper. Mr. Gutch took the intermediate por tion from the cove at the rope-walk to Harward's. He had emigrated from England, and after residing for several years in Salem, came here at about 1657. There is undoubted evidence that he was a minister of the Gospel. He was drowned in 1679, while crossing the river to keep an appointment to preach on the Sabbath. In 1738 the few fam ilies then resident were granted town rights and privileges in a union with the older Georgetown of Arrowsie. The owners of the Kennebec purchase at length extended their claim over this town and quite to the sea ; and about 1750, while suffering from the Indian wars, the the inhabitants of this region were further distressed by litigation, leases and ejectments, by the company. An indignation meeting was at length held by the citizens, to see \" what they should do to preserve their English rights and liberties ; \" and a vigorous petition was sent up to the General Court and prevailed. The famous suit of Jeffers vs. Dwinel was a test case under the Plymouth Company's claim. Jonathan Dwinel (sometimes spelled Donnel) held from Robert Gutch, and Jeffers from the Plymouth Company through the pro prietors of the Kennebec purchase. The courts affirmed the right of"], [111, "BATH. 103 the heirs and assigns of Mr. Gutch ; but when judgment was affirmed against them the wealthy proprietors found means to carry the case to the King's Privy Council. Their case was found to be weak, and they never gained so much authority as warranted them in further disturbing the settlers. In 1753 the territory of Bath and West Bath \u2014 derisively called by opponents the \" Twenty-Cow Parish \" \u2014 \u25a0 in answer to a petition, was set off under the name of the Second Parish of Georgetown. They had heretofore attended on the worship of the Kirk of Scotland in the old meeting-house at the head of Phippsburg ; but in 1762 they finished a house of their own. Merriman, Parker, Page, Adams and Wyeth, were the the earliest temporary supplies, and Rev. Francis Winter, settled in 1757, the first permanent minister. Rev. Hugh Wallis, Asa Lyman, and Rev. John W. Ellingwood \u2014 the latter in 1812 \u2014 were his successors. Just at the time when Greene was campaigning against Cornwallis in the Carolinas, the Second Parish petitioned to be made a town. It was, therefore, in 1781, incorporated as Bath. For this name, commemorating the famous watering-place of English Avon, the city is indebted to Dummer Sewall, Esq., at that time representing this region in the General Court. Bath was the first town incorporated after the new constitution of Massachusetts was adopted. Between the day of the incorporation and the date when the inhabitants assumed their rights the confederation of the thirteen States became a Union of States. The warlike incidents in Bath and its vicinity were a skirmish of a force under Major Church with the Indians near Swan Island (now town of Perkins) in 1692, in which the Indians were routed ; the cap ture of the King's Dock and its commandant by the citizens at the breaking out of the Revolution ; and the repulse of two armed vessels of the British in 1780 by a small battery on a bluff nearly opposite the head of Arrowsie Island. In 1844 the south-western portion was set off as West Bath ; in 1847 Bath received a city charter ; and on the establishment of Saga dahoc county in 1854, it became the county seat. The pioneer in the ship building industry of Bath was Captain William Swanton, who had been a soldier in the French wars, serving in the reduction of Louisburg in 1758. He took up his residence in Bath in 1762, and from this time the population and business of the place steadily increased ; and on the acknowledgement of American independence by Great Britan the inhabitants became extensively and profitably engaged in lumbering and ship building. An eminent citizen who was engaged in the same industry, and also was a great promoter of commerce, was William King, who became the first governor of Maine. Of a later day were E. K. Harding, James Drummond, David Owen, John, James F. and James T. Patten, David C. Magoun, Freeman H. Morse, Bernard C. Bailey. Dr. Israel Putnam, Johnson Rideont, William Torrey, Ammi R Mitchell, William M. Rogers, JohnT. Gilman, Galen Clapp, J. D. Robinson, Otis Kimball, William M. Reed, William V. Moses, Jeremiah Ellsworth, William Drummond, William Rice, John Hayden, Edwin Reed, John G. Richardson, Thomas D. Hyde, and many others highly esteemed. The latter names of these have been mayors of the city. Rev. Samuel F. Dike, Levi P. Lemont and Joshua Philbrook have written historical accounts of Bath. The address of Rev. II. O. Thayer"], [112, "104 GjiZETTEER OF MAINE. on the occasion of the Centennial celebration of the city ; and the full and clear information furnished by the city clerk, S. O. Rogers, Esq., have been of much service in preparing this article. The climate of the town is salubrious, as is shown by the consider able number of residents above ninety years of age. Bath sent 765 soldiers to aid the Government in the preservation of the Union, of which 117 are known to have been lost. To commemorate this sacrifice the city has erected in the park an elegant monument, consisting of a shaft of Hallowell granite on a heavy base ; the height of the whole being about thirty-five feet. There are in the city two church edifices belonging to the Congre gationalists, one to the Baptists, three to the Free Baptists, one to the Universalists, two to the Methodists, one to the Episcopalians, one to the Swedenborgians, one to the Roman Catholics, and there is one Union church. The charitable institutions of the city are a Military and Naval Orphan Asylum and an Old Ladies' Home. Besides the common organizations, Bath has a Board of Trade, a Medical Association and a Maritime Exchange Association. The only public library, the Patten, contains about 3,000 volumes. The city proper has thoroughly graded schools, and the high school has long borne a reputation equal to the best. The number of schoolhouses is fifteen, valued with other school property at $60,000. The valuation of the city in 1870 was $6,402, 713. In 1880 it was $5,913,192. The rate of taxation in the latter year was $25 on $1,000. The population in 1870 was 7,371. In 1880 it was 7,875. Bay View, a post-office in York County Beail'S Corners, a-small village in the north-eastern part of Jay, in Franklin county. BeddillpstOll is situated on the western line of Washington County, on the road between Bangor and Calais. The town of Deblois joins it on the south. The area is 23,040 acres. The Narraguagus and two other ponds in the town form the head waters of the Narra guagus river, and a lake in the north-eastern part of the town is the chief source of the Wescogus, or Pleasant River. The soil is loamy, but wet. Potatoes, corn and wheat yield well when cultivated. The principal elevations of land are Humpback and Spruce Mountains, respectively 2,200 and 2,000 feet in height. The town has one saw and shingle mill. Beddington was incorporated in 1832. Israel Dorman and Benja min Milliken were formerly valued citizens. This town furnished 12 soldiers to the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion, of whom 4 were lost. The Free Baptists have the only church in Beddington. The town has two schoolhouses. The entire school property is valued at $1,200. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $32,034. In 1880 it was $32,605. The population in 1870 was 134. In 1880 it was 129. Belfast, a city and shire town of Waldo County, is situated at the north-western angle of Penobscot Bay, about 20 miles from its mouth, and 10 west of the mouth of the Penobscot. This portion of"], [113, "BELFAST. 105 the large bay is known as Belfast Bay. The city is bounded on the east by Searsport, north by Swanville and Waldo, west by Morrill and Belmont, and south by Northport. Its dimensions in an easterly and westerly line are about 8 miles, by 5\u00a3 north and south. The surface is uneven, rising into considerable hills in the western and southern parts. Mount Percival is the highest elevation, \u2014 its principal summits being respectively 400 and 600 feet above the level of the sea. The rock in town is generally granitic in its character, and is quarried in several localities. The soil is loamy and quite fertile. The principal crops are hay and potatoes. The forest trees are mostly maple, beech and birch. The streams are the Passag-assawa-keag, having its origin in a pond of the same name in the town of Brooks ; Goose River which rises in a pond in Swanville; and Little River, rising in Belmont and running eastward to the bay across the southern part of the town. The Passagassawakeag is navigable to 3 miles from its mouth, at which point is a small village known as the \" Head of the Tide.\" At the mouth of this river on the western side of the bay, is the compact portion of the city. Goose River, which empties into the bay opposite the city, furnishes the larger part of the water-power in use. On this stream are a paper factory, tvVo axe-factories and a grist-mill. The dam at the outlet of the fountain pond and the tide-power dam near the mouth of the stream, are of stone, and very solid. The post-office village, Poor's Mills, is situated on a power of the Passagassakawakeag at the western angle of the township. Little River also has powers which are improved. The city has several grain mills, a sash and blind factor}-, employing from 30 to 50 persons, and a shoe-factory, em ploying from 150 to 200. Other manufactures are ships and boats, blocks, pumps, brass and iron castings, sails, spars, staves, men's cloth ing, tanned wool-skins, bricks, etc. Belfast and Moosehead Railroad, which connects with the Maine Central at Burnham, has its terminus in the city. Belfast has a steam boat connection through the year with Portland and Boston, also to Castine and other towns eastward. In former times shipbuilding was a large business in this city, and many residents are still' largely inter ested in navigation. The business portion of the city is compact, and the buildings principally of brick. The streets devoted to residences are wide and well-shaded with elm and maple trees. The city lies along an undulating acclivity that rises gradually from the water, each successive street along the hillside having a little greater altitude than the last, until at the summit of Congress Street, the elevation is 178 feet above tide-water. From this point the eye commands a beautiful view of Penobscot Bay with its islands, with Blue Hill and the lofty peaks of Mount Desert in the distance. The territory comprising Belfast was a part of the Muscongus or Waldo patent. The first settlers here purchased their lots in 1769 at the low price of twenty-five cents an acre. A surveyor named John Mitchell seems to have been the founder of the town. The next year a company of Scotch-Irish extraction, but last from Londonderry, N H. arrived ; and the place was from this time permanently inhabited. Quite a number of the pioneers, on their arrival became discouraged and re turned in the vessel which brought them. Among those who remained were James Miller and wife, two sons and a daughter, who first landed at the foot of the Frothingham lot. Years later the descendants"], [114, "106 GAZETTEER OF MAINE of Miller, for a considerable period held annual celebrations on the spot of the landing. In 1773, the inhabitants numbering 200, the town was incorporated under the name of Belfast, at the wish of Mr. Miller whose native town in Ireland bore that name. When the war of the Rev olution commenced the inhabitants of Belfast took a decided stand on the side of independence ; and on refusing to take the oath of allegiance to the King they were driven from their homes, and did not return until peace was declared. In the war of 1812, the inhabitants again suffered from the enemy, but not so seriously as in the Revolution. The first settlement in Belfast was on the eastern side of the river, but the greater convenience for communication with the country south ward diverted business to the site of the present city proper. The first bank in the city was incorporated in 1832. The Belfast National Bank has a capital stock of $150,000. The Savings Bank at the close of 1879, held in deposits and accrued profits the sum of $559,432.07. The \" Progressive Age,\" published by William M. Rust, is an able and successful newspaper. It is democratic in politics. The \" Republican Journal,\" published in this city, has long held the reputa tion of an able and witty sheet. It has always done effective service for whatever cause it espoused. It is now republican in its affiliations. The \"Hancock Gazette,\" begun in 1820, was the first newspaper in this city. The first post-ofiiee was opened in Belfast in 1797, and in 1818 this was made a port of entry. Belfast was made the shire town of the county in 1828. In 1845 a portion of the town containing about 500 inhabitants was set off, and joined with the western part of Prospect to form Searsport. In 1853 the city charter was adopted, Hon. Ralph C. Johnson being chosen the first mayor. An extensive fire afflicted the city on October 12, 1865, and a second more severe raged in the after noon and evening of Sunday, Aug. 24, 1873. The loss by this fire was $350,000. Belfast cherishes the memory of many excellent citizens, eminent among whom were ex-governors Hugh J. Anderson and William J. Crosby, Judge J. G. Dickinson, A. G. Jewett, for some time minister to Peru, and others. Two meeting-houses were erected in Belfast in 1792, one on each side of the river. Four years later Rev. Ebenezer Price, the first pastor, was settled. There are now in the city five church edifices, two or more of' them being large and elegant structures. They belong to the Congregationalists, Methodists, Baptists, Unitarians and Universal ists. Belfast has in the city proper a system of graded schools, in which the scholarship has been maintained at a high standard. The number of public schoolhouses in the entire city is eighteen. The total school property is valued at $11,000. The value of estates in 1870 was $2,660,879. In 1880 it was $2,463,677. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 23 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 5,278.* In 1880 it was 5,308. Belgrade lies in the north-western part of Kennebec county, about 10 miles from Augusta. It is bounded on the east by Sidney and West Waterville, south by Manchester and Mount Vernon, west by the latter town and by Rome, and north by the latter and Smithfield in Somerset county. It was within the limits of the Plymouth patent, from which the titles are derived. The first settlements were made"], [115, "BELMONT. 107 about 1774. Its early names were Prescott's also Snow's Plantation, and Washington. It was incorporated under its present name in 1/96. Anson P. and Lot M. Morrill, both ex-governors, and the latter for fifteen years a national senator, and later secretary of the United States Treasury, are sons of Peaslee Morrill, an early settler and native of the town. Other early settlers were James and David Wyman, Cyras Weston, John Richmond, Nathaniel Pinkham, Calvin Stuart, John Pitts, John Richardson, John Page, Dr. Hemmingway and James H. Mosher. It is claimed that there are in town 100 persons who are over seventy years of age. The principal centers of business are Belgrade and North Belgrade, in the eastern part of the town \u2014 at each of which are a station of the Maine Central railroad and a post-office \u2014 and Belgrade Mills, in the north-west, which has a post office. The public ways at the villages are improved by many rock maples and elms, and the town offers much agreeable scenery. The surface of the town is uneven, but there are few high hills. Belgrade Hill is the most elevated of these, being about 500 feet in height. Granite rock crops out here and there. Of woods, beech, birch, maple, hemlock and cedar abound. There is a connected system of lakes in and about the town, all of which empty into the Kennebec. These are Great Pond, in the north-west, having an area of 9 square miles ; Snow Pond, on the east, with an area of 5.15 square miles ; Long Pond, on the west, 4.85 square miles ; Richmond and McGrath Pond, at the north-east, .85 and .75 square miles, respectively. Many islands are in these lakes, one of which has an area of 200 acres The soil of the cultivated parts is chiefly clay and gravelly loam. Agriculture is the largest industry of the town, and potatoes are the largest crop. The principal manufactures consist of a spool, excelsior and rake factory, a saw, shingle and grist-mill, at the Mills ; a saw mill and a factory for making scythe and axe boxes, spade-handles and rakes, at North Belgrade. The spool-factory produces about 4,800 gross of spools per week, and the excelsior mill sends out about eight tons of its product in the same time. There are a Baptist, Free Bap tist and Methodist churches in town. The old \"Titcomb Belgrade Academy \" was established by Samuel Titcomb and John Pitts about 1816. Judge Titcomb, of Augusta, was a son of Samuel. There are eighteen public schoolhouses, valued at $3,600. The valuation of the estates in 1870 was $461,468. In 1880 $493,631. The rate of taxation was 34 mills on $1. The population in 1870 was 1,485. In 1880 it was 1,321. BellllOllt is situated in the southern part of Waldo county, Belfast and Searsport bound it on the east, Lincolnville on the south, Morrill on the north, and Searsmont on the west. Its area is about 10,000 acres. The town has neither high hills nor deep valleys. The rock is generally granitic in character. The soil is usually clay loam, but there is some sand and sandy loam. Agriculture is the principal occupation of the inhabitants. Hay and potatoes are the chief crops. Spruce, oak, birch and maple constitute the forests generally. Tilden Pond is the largest sheet of water, being about three miles in circum ference. The outlet of this pond, with Green Stream and Cross Stream, each afford good water-powers. The two mills which are in operation manufacture lumber and staves. The nearest railroad station is at Belfast (city proper), about six miles from the town line. The post"], [116, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 108 offices are Belmont and East Belmont. The town furnished 42 men for the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion, \u2014 of whom 11 were lost. Belmont has five public schoolhouses ; the entire school property being valued at $2,600. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $101,708. In 1880 it was $103,296. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 23 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 628. In 1880 it was 520. BeilliS, \u2014 a post-office in Franklin County. Bdiedicta is situated on the western side of the southern portion of Aroostook county. Sherman bounds it on the north, Silver Ridge plantation on the east, Penobscot county on the west. On the south is an unnamed township, next south of which is Molunkus, forming the south-western corner of the county. It is 44 miles west of Houlton, on the stage line from Mattawamkeag to Patten. It is formed of the west half of No. 2, Range 5. Plunkett Pond, in the south-western part of the town is the principal body of water. It is about 3 miles long and 1 wide. Several tritutaries of the Molunkus river take their rise in this town. The soil is a yellow loam; the chief crop is hay. The hemlock is the principal forest tree. Most of the lots in town are taken up by settlers; but there is a considerable tract in the north-east and another in the south-east belong ing to Bishop Healey. The business centre is near the centre of the town, where there is a boot and shoe shop, two or more stores, a hotel, Roman Catholic church and parsonage, and a post-office. The town was incorporated in 1872 ; being named in honor of Bishop Benedicta Fenwick, of Boston, who purchased the township of the State of Massachusetts. It was first settled in 1834 by David and Joseph Leavitt. Benedicta sent 11 soldiers to aid the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion, \u2014 of whom 6 were lost. The town has two public schoolhouses. The entire school property, including these, with two lots of land are valued at $1,000. The valuation of estates 1870 was $41,741. In 1880 it was $42,810. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 22 mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 413. In 1880 it was 392. Bell tO 11, in the north-eastern part of Kennebec County, lies on the east side of the Kennebec River, about 25 miles from Augusta. The town was originally a part of Clinton [which see], from which it was set off in 1842, when it was incorporated under the name of Sebasticook. In 1850 the name was changed to Benton. It was a part of the Plymouth patent, and the first settlement was made about the year 1775. Benton is bounded north by Clinton, north-east and east by Unity Plantation, south by Winslow and Albion, and west by Fairfield, in Somerset county. The Kennebec river forms the western line, Sebasticook River passes through the town near the middle, and Fifteen Mile Brook crosses the eastern part. The rock is principally slate, and the soil a clay and slaty loam. Along each of the streams are many fine farms. The principal occupation is agriculture, and the chief crop is hay. The woods common to Maine flourish here. There is a lumber mill on the Sebasticook at Benton Post Office, another at East Benton, on Fifteen Mile Brook."], [117, "BER WICK. 109 At the Falls, on the Sebasticook, the Kennebec Fibre Company have a w-ood paper-pulp mill employing from fifteen.to twenty hands There is also here a mill producing lumber, and wooden shoe-soles, and a manufactory of potato -planters. The Maine Central Railroad passes through the town, having a station at Brown's Corner. On the hill overlooking Benton Falls many Indian relics were formerly found. There is a Union church edifice, which is occupied principally by the Congregationalists. There are also Christian and Methodist societies. The town has ten public schoolhouses, valued at $2,000. There are 398 children of school age, of whom 301 are registered as pupils. The total amount of money actually expended for schools from April 1, 1878, to April 1, 1879, was $1,537. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $248,123. In 1880 it was $376,601. The rate of taxation was about 13 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,180. By the census of 1880, it was 1,173. BeiTy'S Mill,\u2014 a post office in Carthage, Franklin County. Berwick, in York County, first known as a part of Newicha wannock, was incorporated in 1713, being the ninth town in the State. The territory then included also the present North Berwick and South Berwick. Settlements appear to have been made here as early as 1624. Thetitles arederived from Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Rowles, sagamore of the Newichawannock tribe of Indians. In 1643 Humphrey Chadbourne purchased of the sagamore a part of the land on which the village of South Berwick now stands. Spencer and Broughton also purchased land of Rowles the same year. Among the names of residents about this time are the well-known Frost, Shapleigh, Heard, Plaisted, Spen cer, Broughton, Leader and Wincoln. The Boston and Maine railroad passes across the southern part of the town, and the Portsmouth, Great Falls and Conway railroad connects at Great Falls with the former road. The town is bounded on the north by Lebanon, on the east by North Berwick, on the south by South Berwick, and on the western side by New Hampshire. The extent of surface is 13,071 acres, exclusive of water. Its boundary line with the latter is formed by the Salmon Falls river. Little River runs across the northern part of the town, Boundary Brook forms one-third of the eastern line of the town ; and parallel to the latter is Beaver Dam Brook. Love's Brook, further west, runs in the same direction, and Worster Brook runs south west to the Salmon Falls River. Tare-shirt Hill, midway of the town, on the east, and Pine, opposite, near the western side, are the principal elevations. Knight's Pond, four or five square miles in extent, is the largest body of water in town. The rock is> principally granite, and the soil is generally a good sandy loam. The manufactories are a boot and shoe factory employing about 200 persons when in full operation, a machine-shop employing twelve to fifteen persons, a soap factory, employing about a dozen hands, saw and carpentry mills, a candy-factory, a tannery and numerous small establishments. The business centres are Berwick and South Berwick village. Its railroad connections are just outside of the town at Salmon Falls and Great Falls villages, in New Hampshire, on the Boston and Maine, and Portland, Saco, and Portsmouth railroads, and for the north part of the town, at South Lebanon, on the Portland and Rochester railroad."], [118, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 110 Berwick suffered greatly in the Indian wars. In September 1675, the Indians entered the town and assailed the house of John Tozier, which sheltered at that time fifteen women and children. The master of the house had started with Captain Wincoln the day before to repel an attack of the savages upon Saco. A girl of eighteen years discovered the approach of the savages Justin time to close the door in their faces. The fastening being imperfect, she held the door until the savages had cut it through with their hatchets. Finding that the inmates had escaped, the maddened savages wreaked their vengeance by a multitude of blows upon the poor girl. The fort or garrison was about 150 rods from the house, and the pursuing savages overtook and captured two young children. The next day they burned some buildings, but were driven of by the men of the garrison, \u2014 who pursued them until dark. One of the children captured was killed at once, the other kept in cap tivity six months ; the heroic girl who held the door finally recovered from* her wounds. In the folio wing month the savages again assailed the house of Tozier, killed him and carried his son into captivity. Nine men sent to his aid from the garrison fell into an ambush, and three were shot down. A team was soon after sent out under a guard of 20 men to bring in the bodies of the fallen, when they were assailed by about 150 savages. Several of the company fell ; among them Lieutenant Plaisted, commander of the garrison, and his two sons. This garrison was on the place now occupied by John Spencer, Esq. The place revived after this war, so that in 1690 it contained 27 houses. In March, 1690, the place was again attacked by a force of French and Indians under M. D'Artel and the cruel chief, Hopehood. The assault was made at daybreak at three points. The attack was a surprise, but the garrison flew to arms and fought until thirty-four of their number had fallen, when the remnant surrendered from necesssity. The Indians secured fifty-four prisoners, mostly women and children and carried away much plunder. They burned the dwellings, barns and mills, consuming a large number of cattle. In retiring, the savages set firo to the house of Thomas Toogood, murdered his wife and chil dren, and made him a prisoner. While the Indian who had captured Toogood was preparing strings to tie him, the captive snatched the gun of the savage, and threatening him with death if he gave any alarm, retired across the river, while the defeated savage could only revenge himself by shouting \" Nogood \" at his recent prisoner in the distance. At sight of the smoke of the burning village, the inhabitants of neigh boring towns to the number of about 150 gathered at the place and set out in pursuit of the enemy. They overtook them at a narrow bridge over Worst er River, where a sharp conflict ensued that lasted until night. Four or five of the English were taken prisoners and several killed, and the enemy suffered to about the same extent. Probably in all the annals of Indian warfare there is not a record of greater cruelties than were perpetrated by this band upon their English captives of all ages. In July, Hopehood again led his company against the ill-fated town, when the barbarities were repeated to such an extent as they found possible. In 1690 four men mowing in a meadow were attacked by the savages with tomahawks, and three of them cut down. This war continued until January, 1699. Another war commenced in 1703; and all through the autumn inhabitants were killed or taken captive by the ambushed savages."], [119, "BERWICK. 111 In 1723, another war, sometimes called Lovewell's war, broke out. At this time there was not a house between Berwick and Canada. All those built in the town between 1690 and 1745 were of hewed logs, and an effectual defence against small arms. There was a block-house on the western side of Salmon Falls, a mile above Keay's garrison ; and next was Wentworth and Goodwin's block-house. In 1750 there was a fort of this period still standing on Pine Hill, called IIamilton'3 garrison. It was made of poles twenty feet high and pointed at the ends. A band of savages laid in wait about the town in May, but finding the English so well defended they forsook the place, carrying away two captives, and having killed six persons. In the French and Indian war which commenced in 1744, Berwick was garrisoned, but was not attacked. It appears that the town furnished 150 men and several commissioned officers for the capture of Louisburg, which occurred in 1745. Of this matter, Pepperell, commander of the expe dition, wrote to Major Hill, under date of February 21, 1745 : \" Yes terday I heard that Capt. Busteed had enlisted fifty brave soldiers in Berwick. This news is like a cordial to me. The commissioned officers of Berwick are as brave and as good men as any in the province. Please tell them all that I sincerely value and love them. If any of them wish to go, give them the offer and tell them to be with me to morrow.\" When the w-ar of the Revolution approached, the people of Berwick were ready to support their brethren to the utmost of their ability. Meetings were frequently held during the war, in which large bounties were offered to encourage enlistments. Two full companies were sent under captains Philip Hubbard and Daniel Wood. A historian of the period writes : \" To their everlasting honor be it said that they furnished as many men, according to the number of inhabitants, as any town in the country. There are but few ancient homesteads in the town that are not honored by the grave of some Revolutionary soldier.\" In the war of 1812 the government was well supported, although some in town held meetings in which they denounced the war as unjust and unrighteous. In the war of the Rebellion Berwick furnished for the Union army 138 men, mostly her own citizens, while 78 Berwick men enlisted in neighboring towns. Berwick paid out for bounties and incidental expenses connected with enlistments $44,802. The town has had many citizens of eminence, while several distin guished citizens of other towns and cities had their nativity within its borders. One of the most noted founders of families was John Sullivan, an Irishman by birth and education. He arrived in Maine in 1723, and opened a school in Berwick soon after. During the voyage from Ireland he made the acquaintance of a young girl nine years of age, named Margery Brown ; who by some strange means was on board the vessel without friends. Neither had she the money to pay for her passage ; and Mr. Sullivan assumed the debt, and took the girl as his ward. In 1763 when she was about 21 years of age and he was 44, they were married. He soon after purchased a farm in Berwick, upon which he lived more than 60 years. He died in 1796, in his 105th year ; and his widow died in 1801, aged 87. On this farm were born to them 4 children, of whom were John and James Sullivan. The first was a leader in the first overt act of the Revolution, a general in the war, and a governor of"], [120, "GjiZETTEER OF MAINE. 112 the State of New Hampshire ; the other, the acknowledged leader at the bar, a governor of Massachusetts, and one who contributed by his speeches and writings to the establishment of our national liberties. Newichawnanock was incorporated as the Parish of Unity in 1673, and in 1702, John Wade was settled as minister. The Baptists began their activity- in the town in 1764, and in 1768 a church was formed at Great Hill, and a meeting-house built soon after. This was the first Baptist Church organized in Maine. Joshua Emery was their preacher for many years, though he was never or dained. He was succeeded by William Batchelder, who was ordained as pastor in 1796. A new house was built in 1844; and in 1867 it was removed and rebuilt. The Methodists began to have considerable influence in the town about 1810. John Lord was one of their early preachers. The first house was built about 1840, and it was burned before completion; but another was soon after built in the neighborhood to replace it. Ber wick has sixteen schoolhouses; audits school property is valued at $16,750. It has also a free high school. The valuation of the town in 1870, was $641,329. In 1880 it was $821,629. The rate of taxation in 1880 was $13 per $100. The population in 1870 was 2,291 ; in 1880 it was 2,774. Bethel is situated on both sides of the Androscoggin, a little west of the centre of Oxford County. The Grand Trunk railway also passes through the town, following the course of the river to near the centre, when the road turns away to South Bethel, and thus out of the town on the south side. The greatest length of the town is from north east to the south-west. The area is 25,920 acres. The Androscoggin river enters the western side to near the centre, then turning north ward forms the dividing line on the north-east between Bethel and Hanover. Chapman River and Sunday River are the principal tribu taries of the Androscoggin on the north, and Mill Stream and Alden- Brook on the south, within this town. The surface of the country is undu lating and hilly. The principal eminences, beginning at the north west, are Ellingwood Mountain, then Sparrowhawk Mountain, at an equal distance south of the River; Paradise Hill, near Bethel Hill village (Bethel Post-Office), Walker's Mountain, just north of South Bethel ; Waterspout Mountain and Swan Hill, north of the last, in the north bend of the Androscoggin; and in the east, a group of five hills. There are several more that bear no names on the town map. The principal rock is granite. Though so hilly, Bethel has much interval and meadow-land as well as upland. It is one of the best farming towns of the State. Hay and potatoes are the chief crops. The most numerous forest trees are maple, birch, beach, oak, pine, hemlock, spruce, fir and cedar. The scenery of Bethel, like that of many other towns in Oxford county, is very attractive. The winding course of the larger river through intervals and between lofty hills affords numerous bold and picturesque views, as well as many of quiet beauty. From the summits of any of these hills the eye commands an extensive landscape. Bethel, West and South Bethel are the post-offices and centres of business. There are four steam mills of from twenty-five to sixty horse-power in the town, together with several mill's using water"], [121, "BIDDEFORD. 113 power. The 'manufacturers consist of lumber, spools, flour and meal, leather, furniture, boots and shoes, carriages and harnesses, marble and granite work, etc. Bethel was originally granted to Josiah Richardson, of Sudbury, Mass., and others, for services in the French war. Being well on to ward Canada, and being granted for services there, it gained the name among its settlers and others of \" Sudbury-Canada.\" Nathaniel Segar, of Newton, Mass., in the spring of 1774, made the first attempt to clear land for the purpose of making a settlement in the region of Bethel. The revolution drew him away until 1779 ; when he returned accompanied by Jonathan Bartlett and a boy named Aaron Barton. Samuel Ingalls removed from Andover to this town in the fall of 1796. His wife, who accompanied him, was the first white woman in town. The last hostile incursion of the Indians into Maine was made in August, 1781 ; when a party from St. Francis made an attack upon the outer settlements, taking all the plunder they could, and carrying away captive, Benjamin Clark and Nathaniel Segar, whom they detained until the war closed, sixteen months later. Set tlers came in rapidly after the close of the Revolution. Among the first were the six stalwart Bartlett brothers, from Newton, Mass. In 1789, Rev. Eliphaz Chapman came in with a large family of sons. The town was incorporated under its present name in 1796, and the first religious society was organized the same year. Rev. Daniel Gould, the first pastor, was settled in 1799. Dr. John Brickett was the first physician, coming in from Haverhill in 1796. He returned in a short time, and was succeeded in 1799, by Dr. Timothy Carter, who prac ticed in this town forty-six years. William Frye was the first lawyer in Bethel. Gould's Academy was incorporated in 1836. Isaac Ran dal was the first precepter ; and under Dr. N. True, preceptor from 1848 to 1861, it attained to high rank. Some of our ablest men have attended this school. In 1881, the old edifice gave place to anew one, costing $4,000. Bethel has twenty-five public school-houses, valued, with other school property, at $7,000. There is a library of 300 volumes. There are in the town two Congregational churches, one Methodist, a Universalist, a Free Baptist and a Calvinist Baptist. The valuation of estates in 1870, was $712,871. In 1880, it was 738,586. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 21 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870, was 2,286. In 1880, it was 2,077. BiddefOl'd, in York County, includes the site of the earliest permanent settlement in Maine of which we have a conclusive record. In furtherance of Sir Ferdinando Gorges' plans of settlement, Richard Vines, a physician, passed the winter of 1616-17 at a place at the mouth of the Saco which he called Winter Harbor. Vines performed several voyages for Gorges, and appears to have made this a place of usual resort. The first dwellings were built on the north side of the Pool. Old cellars covered with ancient shrubbery, and partly filled well-cavities until a recent time, told of its early occupancy. Apple trees decayed with age, and the English cherry, dispute the place with oak and sumach. In describing the boundary of an estate here in 1642, \"Church Point\" is one of the landmarks referred to, \u2014 from which in ference is made that it was then or had been the site of a church. Rev. 7"], [122, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 114 Richard Gibson, residing on this coast, appeared in a. snit-at-law in 1636 Between 1660 and 1666 a meeting-house was built at VV inter Harbor, and it is recorded that in this house the people were seated ac cording to rank. A point of land near the head of the Pool ls^said to have been occupied by a court house in the period of Maine's early settlement. The town is situated upon the sea-coast on the southern bank of Saco River, by which stream it is separated from Saco,\u2014 of which it was formerly a part. The latter bounds it on the north-east,\u2014 on the east is the sea. Kennebunkport lies on the south and south west, and Davton on the north-west. Its greatest length is 10 miles in a north-west and south-west direction, and it contains, according to the \"York County Atlas,\" 9,653 acres of land. Its territory was originally granted by the Plymouth Council to John Oldham and Richard Vines in 1630, and\" was described in their patent as \" that tract of land lying on the south side of the River Swanckadocke (Saco), containing in breadth, by the sea, four miles, and extending eight miles up into the main land.\" Vines was an inhabitant until about 1645, when lie sold his right to Dr. Robert Child, of Massachusetts, and removed to Barbadoes. Dr. Child sold the same to Major William Phillips, of Boston in 1659, for \u00a390 sterling. Phillips, to make his ownership secure, soon after purchased another title to it from the Indian sachem, Mogg Megone. It was in cluded with the other side of the river in a corporation under the name of Saco from 1653 to 1718, when it was incorporated by itself, receiv ing the name of Biddeford, \u2014 a town in England whence some of the in- habitants had emigrated. A grant for the first saw-mill on Saco River was made by the corpora tion in 1653, to Roger Spencer, on con dition that the mill be completed within one year, and that the townsmen have boards 12d. cheaper than strangers, and that townsmen be preferred as employes. It is to be supposed that this grant included the right to certain timber lands above the falls. John Davis had a similar privilege granted in 1654 ; but he was allowed two and one-half years in which to finish his mill, and was to furnish boards lOd. per 100 less than current rates to inhabitants of the town. People were admitted to be inhabitants by vote of the town, and some were warned not to settle there. Captain Samuel Jordan, a grandson of Rev. Robert Jordan, opened a store near Biddeford Pool in 1717. His home was secured against attacks from the Indians by a strong stone wall which surrounded it. Major Phillips' garrison was a few rods below the lower falls of the Saco. BIDDEFOED POOL. During the first century of the Saco settlements a numerous tribe of Indians dwelt on the upper waters of the river. Squaudo, their"], [123, "BIDDEFORD. 115 chief sachem, became deeply incensed against the English, because of an experiment made by some English sailors, who overset the canoe containing his squaw and child in the river to see if the infant would swim, \u2014 according to the reports of Indian children. The child died not long after, aud Squando determined on war. In September, 1675, warned by the burning of a house on the Saco side, the inhabitants gathered into Phillips' garrison. A bod)' of savages soon after made an attack upon the place, wounding Major Phillips, and burning his mill and one of his tenant houses. Failing to effect anything by direct assault, they, on the second day, prepared to burn the garrison by thrusting against it a cart loaded with combustibles. One of the wheels stuck in a mud-hole, swinging the cart about and exposing to view the Indians who were moving it, when a discharge from the garrison killed 6 and wounded 15 of them. At this repulse the Indians left the place for some days ; and the 50 persons in the garrison house, lacking supplies, retired to Winter Harbor. About a fortnight later the garrison-house and all the houses up the river from Winter Harbor were burned by the Indians. In 1693, Major Converse, under direc JORDAN'S GARRISON. (Now Residence of Tristram Goldthwait). tion of the Massachusetts government, built a stone fort a short dis tance below the Falls ; but at the first attack in 1703, it appears to have been taken, as 11 of the inmates were killed and 24 carried cap tive to Canada. The garrison at Winter Harbor had previously sur rendered. A month later, while the fort was undergoing repairs, a body of Indians attacked a garrison near by and were repulsed. In 1707, an engagement occurred at Winter Harbor between a fleet of 50 canoes manned by about 150 Indians, and 2 small vessels, manned only by Captain Austin, Mr. Harmon, Sergeant Cole, 5 other men and a boy. One of the vessels was captured, but its crew escaped to the other, which they held. The action lasted three hours, and the Eng lish lost but one man. In 1708, the garrison was removed from the stone fort, and a new fort commenced near the entrance of the Pool. It was named Fort Mar}'. Remains of it are still visible, and the point where it stood is yet called Fort Hill. These were all the consider able engagements within the limits of Biddeford ; but numerous per sons were at one time and another killed or captured by the savages all along the river. In 1744 the old garrisons were repaired and sev eral new ones built. The town records show a vote to build a strong; frame garrison about the parsonage, sixty feet square, planked"], [124, "116 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. up with two-inch plank, and having tw-o flankers. At Winter Har bor, near the shore, four houses situated on a square, were strongly garrisoned, and occupied by a number of families. Captain Smith's public house was protected by a brick wall on the inside, with flankers at each end. After the peace of 1748 the town suffered no further from the Indians. The action of the town during the Revolution was highly honor able. Colonel John Smith and some 30 other citizens entered the Continental army for the war, The privateer \"Thrasher,\" com manded by Captain Benjamin Cole, belonged to Biddeford. Captain Phillip Goldthwaite, inspector of the port, was the only person in town who opposed the war. During the war of 1812, the British destroyed shipping at the mouth of the river, including some ships on the stocks at Captain Thomas Cutts' shipyard at the Neck. The first bridge leading from Biddeford to Saco was built by Colonel Thomas Cutts, Deacon Amos Chase, Thomas Gilpatrick, Jr., and Benjamin Nason, in 1767. It spanned the west branch of the river to Indian Island, and was made a toll bridge by act of General Court in 1768. Colonel Cutts bought out Chase and Nason, when it began to be called Cutts' Bridge. Previous to this a bridge (paid for by a lottery) had been erected, connecting the island with Saco side, a ferry over the western branch completing the passage until Cutts' Bridge was built. A post office was first established in town in 1789, the postmaster being Benjamin Hooper. In 1855, Biddeford was incorporated as a city, Daniel Somes becoming the first mayor. Its population by the first census, in 1790, was 1,018 ; in 1850, 6,095 ; 1860, 9,350 ; 1870, 10,285 ; 1880, 12,653. Rev. Richard Gibson, a clergyman of the Church of England, is believed to be have been the first ordained minister resident in York county. He was on that coast as early as 1636. Rev. Robert Jordan succeeded him about 1640. Both must at some time have officiated in Biddeford. Rev. Thomas Jenner, a Non-conformist, preached in the town in 1641, remaining about two years. He is thought by some to have been the first Puritan preacher in Maine. Rev. Seth Fletcher is the first minister of Biddeford of whose engage ment any record is preserved. The town employed him from 1666, and he appears to have continued there until the settlement was de stroyed in 1675. A parsonage was built about 1685. The first Con gregational Church was formed in 1730, and Samuel Willard, ordained in the same year, was its first minister. Biddeford was separated into two parishes in 1797, and a new edifice built soon after ; Rev. John Turner was the first minister of this second Congregational Church. The Pavilion Church was organized in 1857, and the \"Rev. Samuel M. Gould became pastor from the date of organization. The first Methodist meeting-house was built in 1847. The first Catholic church (St. Mary's) was built in 1855. Christ Church (Episcopal) was organ ized in 1869. There are now eight church edifices within the village portion of the town, five of them being of brick, and two or three, large and elegant structures. Biddeford schools have for several years been graded from primary to high. The number of schoolhouses is 21 ; and the value of the"], [125, "BIDpEFORD. 117 property is estimated at $30,000. The total amount actually expended for public schools from April 1, 1878 to April 1, 1879, $16,246. The value of estates in 1870 was $5,682,402. In 1880 it was $5,877,867. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2 per cent. The popu lation in 1870 was 12,652. In 1880 it was 10,282. The city hall is a handsome brick edifice three stories in height. The lower story is oc cupied by stores and the post office ; the second, by private and gov ernment offices and rooms ; and the third, by an excellent hall. The building also contains a public library of about 3,000 volumes. There are small powers on Swan Pond Creek, in the north of the town, and on Little River, at the south ; but the business centre and the manufacturing power is at the falls of the Saco river. The river has here a descent of forty feet, divided into two falls, about one eighth of a mile apart, the upper being eight feet and the lower thirty-two. At this point are located seven cotton mills, aggregating 165,000 spindles. Of these, the Laconia Company (organized in 1845) BIDDEFORD HOrfiE. has 75,000 and the Pepperell Company (organized 1850) 90,000. The Hardy Manufacturing Company, incorporated in 1865, manufac tures card-grinders, cotton and woolen machinery, gas fixtures, etc. The Saco Water-Power Machine Shop Company was incorporated and went into operation in 1867, with a capital of $300,000. It manufac tures cotton and woolen machinery, and gives employment to about 500 men. There are also three boot and shoe factories, three foun dries for brass, iron and stoves respectively, loom picker and harness manufactories, several lumber and grain mills, granite quarries, brick yards, and other lesser manufactures. The Boston and Maine, and the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroads each have a station in Biddeford ; and steam and sailing vessels ascend the river to within a short distance of the lower fall. Biddeford is a port of delivery in the Saco Customs District. The city has one daily and two weekly news papers, and one humorous and one religious monthly. The \"Union and Journal \" is an excellent and well-established paper, now pub lished on Friday of each week by G. A. Hobbs. It is Republican in"], [126, "GAZETTEER f)F MAINE. 118 politics. The \"Biddeford Weekly Advance\" is a new publication, but receives a goodly patronage. \" It is a lively paper and has been independent in politics. Saturday is its date of publication. The \" Biddeford Daily Times\" is also independent, and is a good local paper. The humorous monthly, the \" Monthly Miniature,\" is published by Will H. Watson. The \" Church and Home\" is published by J. J. Hall. The city has two national banks and banks for savings. The surface of the town is quite hilly, and many portions quite rocky, \u2014 granite being the prevailing rock. Yet the soil is good, and the farms are generally productive. Corn and hay are the leading crops. There are many small tracts of forest, haying the usual variety of trees. The roads are good, and the town affords many attractive drives. The Pool has become largely patronized as a seaside resort, and has several hotels. At Fletcher's Neck is a life saving station of the U. S., and at Wood Island, at the mouth of the harbor, is a light house of the same name. It has a flashing red light. The tower is of stone, and the dwelling, a story and a half wooden building. It is connected with the tower by a wooden porch, all being whitewashed. The eminent men of Biddeford in the days gone by, are James Sul livan, who became judge of the Supreme Court and, later, governor of Massachusetts ; Hon. George Thacher, representative in Congress from Massachusetts, and judge of the Supreme Court of that com monwealth ; Hon. Prentiss Mellen, United States Senator from Mas sachusetts, and afterward chief justice of the Supreme Court of Maine ; Hon. Samuel Hubbard, judge of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts ; and D. E. Somes, a manufacturer of the city, who represented the First Maine district in the National Congress in 1859.\u2014 (See Saco).* Billg'haill is situated on the east bank of the Kennebec River, near the middle of the southern half of the county. It is bounded on the east by Brighton, south by Solon, north by Concord, and west by Moscow. The area is 23,040 acres. Johnson Mountain, situated in the north-eastern part, is the principal elevation, estimated to be above 1,000 feet in height. Fall Brook and its branches occupy the southern part, and Austin Stream crosses the north-western part to the Kennebec. The soil is generally red and gray loam, and yields good crops of hay, potatoes and various grains. Beech, birch, maple and spruce constitute the forests. The centre of business is Bingham vil lage, situated on Austin Stream, near the Kennebec, and close upon the Moscow line, on Austin Stream. The mills are mostly over the Mos cow line; but there are saw and grist-mills in Bingham ; and on Falls Brook there are one or more saw-mills. The manufactures consist of all varieties of lumber, driving calks and sets, carriages, harnesses, etc. The town is 22 miles N. N.W. of Skowhegan on the stage line to the Forks. The nearest railroad station is at Anson, 16 miles distant. The first settlement was made in this town as early as 1784, and was surveyed in 1801, by Philip Bullen. It was incorporated on the 6th of February, 1812 ; taking its name from William Bingham, in whose purchase ot 1,000,000 of acres in this region, it was included. There is a Congregational society in the town, and a Union meet ing-house. Bingham has nine public schoolhouses ; these, with other \u00ab We are indebted to Mr. J. S.

The valuation of estate in 1870 was $201,017. In 1880 it was $201,471. The rate of taxation in the latter year was two per cent, for the money tax. The population in 1870 was 820. In 1880 it was 828. Bing\"haill Purchase refers to two tracts of land in Maine, secured about 1785 to 1790, for the eastern one, and 1793 for the western, by William Bingham, a wealthy merchant and banker of Philadelphia. These tracts consisted of about 1,000,000 acres each ; one lying in south-eastern aud the other in western Maine. The boundaries of the eastern tract was as follows : \u2014 Beginning at the north-western corner of No. 8, at Union River, thence north 30 miles and including one tier north of the end of that line, excepting the corner township ; thence east to the St. Croix ; thence south by Den ny's River to the north-eastern part of Whiting, thence westward north of Machias to the starting point, \u2014 embracing a total of 50 town ships. In western Maine the north line of the purchase is the same with the north line of townships in Range VII, which strikes near the middle of Moosehead Lake on the western side ; thence southward on the eastern line of the western tier of towns in Piscataquis County, to the south-eastern corner of Wellington, the south-western town of the county ; thence westward on a line with the southerly line of that town, to the south-western angle of Mount Abraham township ; thence northerly to the boundary line first described, striking it about one mile and a quarter west of the eastern line of Lowell, the north-eastern town of Franklin County, on the Canadian border. This comprised about 1,000,000 acres, \u2014 above 60 townships. The history of these purchases is as follows : The title of most of the unsettled lands in Maine was in the Commonwealth of Massachu setts. Needing money, that government, in 1786, took steps to dispose of a large quantity of land in eastern Maine by lottery, in the hope that the drawers of prizes would settle their lands. This hope was not realized ; and soon after the drawing, Mr. Bingham, who also had drawn many of the townships, purchased most of the remainder. The western tract was contracted for by General Knox, by the advice of Gen eral Lincoln, of Massachusetts, who had explored the territory. Lack ing funds to pay for his purchase, and being so much occupied with his duties as Secretary of War that he was unable to attend to this property, he transferred his contract to his friend Mr. Bingham, who deserved well of the country, having rendered much financial aid dur ing the Revolution. Mr. Bingham died in Bath, England, in 1806, leaving one son, who settled in Montreal ; two daughters, who mar ried the brothers, Alexander and Henry Baring, of the eminent bank ing-house of that name, in London ; the other daughters marrying Robert Gilmore, of Baltimore, Charles M. Willing and Charles W. Hare, of Philadelphia. Soon after Mr. Bingham went to England, he appointed a young man named John Black as his agent to manage his lands in Maine ; and this duty he attended to until his death in 1856. Alexander Baring eventually became a peer of the realm, with the title of Lord Ashburton. Without the approval of her cabinet the queen of England appointed him as Envoy Extraordinary to the United States, in 1842, to settle the northern and eastern boundary question ; hence the treaty framed by him and Daniel Webster, \u2014 at that time"], [128, "120 GAjZETTEER OF MAINE. American Secretary of State \u2014 is known as the Webster-Ashburton treaty. William Allen, Esq., of Norridgewock, was employed by Colonel Black as eai'ly as the summer of 1828 in overseeing the mak ing of roads and settling taxes in this territory, and continued in the employment and in making sales more or less until 1855 ; at which date much land was still held by the heirs. No explanation of the transactions of the General Court with the devisees and records was publicly made until 1868, when a brief statement of the facts was placed on file in the collections of the Maine Historical Society. Bircll Harbor,\u2014 a post-office in Hancock County. Blailie is situated on the eastern border of the State and county, 26 miles north of Houlton. It was formerly Alva planta tion. It was incorporated as a town in 1874, and named in honor of Hon. James G. Blaine. It is bounded east by New Brunswick, south by Bridgewater, west by unnamed townships, and north by Mars Hill. The lattertown contains the eminence of the same, name celebrated as a land-mark in the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick. The surface of the town is not varied by high hills except in the south western corner, whence a group spreads away to the south-west. The principal streams are Presque Isle Stream, which runs southward across the middle of the town, and its eastern and western tributa ries, Young Brook and Three Brooks Stream. The centre of business is at the northern side on the Presque Isle road. The town post-office a hotel, and several stores are at this point. The manufactures are shingles, carriages, and boots and shoes. The Free Baptists have estab lished a church in the town. Blaine has four public schoolhouses, valued at $1,300. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $35,093. In 1880 it was $49,860. The population in 1880 was 646. BlailChard is situated in the south-western part of Piscata quis county, 20 miles north-west of Dover. The town is at present the terminus of the Bangor and Piscataquis Railway. The State road from Athens to Moosehead Lake passes through Blanchard, \u2014 over which has gone much of the travel to that point. The township was a part of the Bingham purchase, which was locally known as the \" Million-acre Tract.\" Its area is 28,000 acres. Russell'Mountain covers quite a portion of it, and other high hills greatly diminish its tillage surface. It is bounded on the north by Shirley, on the east by Monson, south by Kingsbury, and west by Mayfield, in Somerset county. There are several small ponds bearing the names, respectively, of Spectacle, Mud, Thanksgiving, Bracket and Whetstone. The town ship formerly abounded with pine timber ; and at Blanchard village one of its mill privileges has long been occupied by saw-mills. Several slate quarries have been opened in town, and there appears to be o-ood promise of profit from the stores of this material. The slate is of fine quality, and susceptible of a high polish. Ebenezej- Deane was the first settler, making his first clearing in 1813. The township was purchased a few years later by Charles Blan chard, Esq., of Portland, and Hon. Thomas Davee, of Dover, for the sum of $4,000. A number of settlers came in soon after. The town was"], [129, "BLUE HILL. 121 incorporated in 1831, being named in honor of the largest proprietor, Mr. Blanchard, who owned three-fourths of the township. Mr. Davee moved his family into town in 1832, and with Mr. Blanchard, bought and rebuilt the mills and dam, adding a grist-mill. A good covered bridge was soon after built across the river. A Congregational church was organized, and in 1834 a minister was settled over it. A church was built the same year. There is now a Methodist and a Free Baptist society in town. Abner Coburn and his brothers in 1835 bought 14,000 acres in the town at $2 per acre. The railway was extended to Blanchard in 1876. Mr. Davee, while residing in Blanchard, was speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, sheriff of Somerset County, and twice a re presentative of his district in the national Congress. Another esteemed citizen was Ozias Blanchard, member at different times of both branches of the State legislature ; also Ephraim Packard, judge of Probate. The town sent 16 men to the army of the Union in the late war, \u2014 of which number 3 were lost. Blanchard has but one school-district, and its school property is valued at $800. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $33,142. The rate of taxation in 1880 was two and a half per cent. The population in 1870 was 164. In 1880 it was 166. Bllie Hill is situated on Union River Bay, in the south- western part of Hancock County. It is 14 miles S. S. W. of Ellsworth, and 36 miles from Bangor, and is on the stage-lines from Bucksport to Sedgewick and from Castine to Ellsworth. Surry bounds it on the north-east, Penobscot on the north-west, Brooksville and Sedgewick on the south-west. On the south-east are the waters of Union.River Bay, from which Blue Hill Bay pushes up into the town. The name, Blue Hill, comes from a commanding elevation of land near the centre of the town. The ascent begins at the shore of tho bay, continuing in a gradual ascent for about a mile, and thence is quite abrupt to the huge mass of rock which forms the top. The height above high water is 950 feet, \u2014 so that the hill affords extended and charming views on every side. It was formerly covered with trees \u2014 principally evergreens \u2014 which, at a distance, gave a very dark blue tint, \u2014 whence its name. The soil of Blue Hill is clay loam and gravel. The principal rock is granite. There are also extensive deposits of manganese and limestone. Other minerals found in town are fluor spar, iron ore, copper ore, gold, lead ore in a form of galena, wolfram, the ore of tin, hydrate of silica, used in the making of fire-proof brick, phosphate of lime, etc. The town has an excellent quality of granite, of which at some times large quantity have been quarried. In 1876, these quarries afforded employment for 30 yoke of oxen and 300 laborers. East River Bridge, at New York, was constructed of Blue Hill granite. At the present time there are also 22 mining and smelting companies owning territory- in the town. McIIeard's, Norris, First, Second, Third and Fourth are the prin cipal ponds, being from half a mile to a mile in diameter. The outlets of these ponds furnish power for several small saw and grist mills. One of the bridges, constructed of wood and granite, is 200 feet in length. Blue Hill was first settled in 1762 near \" Fire Falls,\" where Blue"], [130, "122 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Hill Bay communicates with a salt-water pond. The pioneers were Capt. Joseph Wood and John Roundy. The third family in town was formed by the marriage of Capt. Wood's daughter with Col. Parker, who had served at the siege of Louisbourg. The family of Samuel Foster was the fourth, and the next were Col. Nicholas Holt, Ezekiel Osgood, and Nehemiah Hinkley. The first child, Jonathan Darling, was born in 1765 ; the second child, Edith Wood, in 1766. Several citizens of Blue Hill served in the Revolutionary war. Christopher Osgood, one of the first setlers, was at the battle of Bunker Hill. Nehemiah Hinkley served through the war, and was honorably dis charged at West Point. The town furnished 196 soldiers to the Union army during the Rebellion, and paid out in bounties $17,995. Among the notable citizens of a later period, but now deceased, were John Peters, Eben. Floyd, Nathan Ellis, and Andrew Witham. There are several residents above eighty years of age, and one over ninety. The township was first known as \"Number 5.\" The plantation name was \" Newport.\" It was incorporated as a town in 1789. A Congre gational church was formed in 1772, and a Baptist church in 1806. There is now an additional Baptist church, at East Blue Hill. The first post-office was established in 1795. Jonathan Fisher was the settled minister from 1796 to 1837. He was somewhat eccentric, but a worthy minister. Blue Hill Academy was incorporated in 1803, being endowed by a grant of one half of Number 23, in Washington county. This property was sold in 1806, for $6,252. The academy has a library of about 500 volumes. The income from the fund (now about $5,000) and tuition fees sustain instruction for about half the year. Blue Hill has an excellent academy, and seventeen public schoolhouses, the school property being valued at $7,800. The valua tion of real estate m 1870 was $397,620. In 1880, it was $449,497. The rate of taxation the latter year was 16^ mills on the dollar, including the highway tax. The population in 1870 was 1,707. In the census of 1880 it was 2,213.

The surface is moder ately irregular, without high hills. Agriculture is largely followed, and fair crops are obtained in return for thorough cultivation. The principal occupation of the inhabitants, however, relates to the fish eries. Barton's, Sawyer's and Hodgden's islands lie near together on the west side of the town ; and at the south is Squirrel Island, which, though without other than the family of the keeper in winter, is in"], [131, "BOOTHBAT. 123 summer quite a populous village, being a convenient and agreeable sea-side resort. The harbors are Boothbay Harbor, midway of its southern shore ; Linakin's Bay, east of the former, and separated from it by the promontory of Spruce Point ; aud Pleasant Cove, off Damar iscotta River, in the north-eastern part of the town. Linakin's Neck is a long projection of the south-east part of the town curving west ward, and forming Linakin's Bay. The principal ponds are Adam's, in the centre of the town ; and south of this, Campbell's Pond, with its outlet, Campbell's Creek, running southward to the sea. Oven's Mouth River is a little more than an arm of the sea. It extends from a little north of the centre of the town to its northern boun dary, whence it turns westward, joining Back River, and the Sheepscot beyond. Back River is but a channel of the Sheepseot, separating Barter's Island from the main land. Boothbay is noted for its fine harbors, and its extensive business in the menhaden or porgie fishery, and the extraction of the oil and the preparations of guano from this fish. Boothbay Harbor is es teemed one of the best in the eastern country. It has four entrances, is of ample size and depth, and is well protected. In 1779 it was the rendezvous of the American expedition against the British at Castine. In recent years it has sometimes in time of bad weather held four or five hundred vessels at a time, consisting chiefly of fishermen, who sought its shelter, or came in for supplies of bait, etc., Boothbay Harbor is a port of entry in the Wiscasset District. At the beginning of 1881, there were doing business at Boothbay village, one fishery and oil com pany, an ice company, two marine railways, a company manufacturing fertilizers, a factory for canning lobsters, and several manufactures carried on by single parties. At East Boothbay, (Hodgdon's Mills) two firms and an incorporated company are engaged in preparing oil and guano from porgies ; and there are also a large saw-mill and two shipbuilding firms. The other village is North Boothbay, situated at the centre of the town. There is here an establishment of the Knickerbocker Ice Company. Boothbay village is 12 miles south of Wiscasset, with which it is connected by a stage-line. It is the term inus of the daily steamboat line from Bath in the summer, and from Wiscasset in the winter. Boothbay was formerly known as a part of Cape Newagen. It is supposed to have been occupied as early as 1630. Boothbay Harbor (formerly Townsend) is considered by many to be the \" Pentecost Harbor,\" on whose shores the crew of Captain Weymouth planted and raised a crop of garden vegetables in 1605. Henry Curtis, in 1666, purchased of the famous sagamore, Robin Hood, the right to settle here ; but in the second Indian war (1688) the savages destroyed the settlement. It lay waste and almost desolate for 40 years subsequent. In 1730, it was revived by Colonel Dunbar, who gave it the name of Townsend. It was incorporated under that name in 1764, retaining the old name until 1842, when it received the name it now bears, in memory of Old Boothbay, in Lincolnshire, England. It formerly in cluded Southport and the western part of Edgecomb. The hardships of that early period were sometimes almost beyond belief. The set tlers brought in by Dunbar were largely Presbyterians from the north of Ireland, some of whom had been actors in the scenes of the Eng lish Revolution of 1688. The simple faith of these emmigrants is well"], [132, "GjiZETTEER OF MAINE. 124 illustrated in an anecdote related by Willis, [see his account of the \" Scotch-Irish Immigration \" to this country] of Andrew Reed, an uncle of the celebrated Presbyterian, Rev. John Murray. During the last Indian war the residents of Boothbay Harbor withdrew to the westward for safety. Mr. Reed alone refused to go, and, in defiance of all persuasion, persisted in remaining in his rude log cabin. Con trary to all expectation, the fugitives, on their return in the spring, found him alive and unharmed. To their wondering inquiries he calmly replied that he had felt neither solitude nor alarm. \" Why should I? Had I not my Bible with me?\" cried the old man. Rev. John Murray, to whom allusion has been made, was settled at Booth bay in the years just preceeding the Revolution. After removing from Boothbay, he was settled over the \" Whitefield Church \" in New buryport, where his services were often attended by audiences of 2,000 people. Early in the war of the Revolution, British cruisers sometimes put into Boothbay Harbor, where the sailors frequently went ashore to rob the people. The plundered inhabitants remonstrated with the officers, but to no effect. As a last resort the people requested Mr. Murray to make an effort for their relief. They embarked him in a capacious boat, and paddled out to the British ship, whose crew were at this time bearing so heavily upon them. The approaching boat challenged the attention of the whole ship's company, who were on the alert to know its business. Their surprise was great when they beheld upon the deck of their vessel the noble figure of the clergyman, clad in the full canonicals of the Presbyterian order. They gazed upon him in silent wonder, while he set forth the sad case of his struggling and suffering parishioners with such force and pathos that the town was no more afflicted by those attached to this vessel. The Boothbay Savings Bank held in deposits and profits at the close of 1879, $35,795.87. At Boothbay village there are now Con gregationalism Free Baptist and Methodist churches; at North Booth bay is a Congregationalist and Free Baptist, and at East Boothbay a Methodist church, and on Barter's Island, a Free Baptist church. Boothbay has sixteen public schoolhouses, and the entire school property is valued at $20,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $642,819. In 1880, it was $769,760. The population in 1870 was 3,200. In 1880 it was 3,576. BOWtloiU is situated in the north-western part of Sagadahoc county. Bowdoinham bounds it on the east, Topsham on the south, Litchfield, in Kennebec county, on the north, and Webster, in Andros coggin county, on the west.

Bowdoin Centre, Bow doin and West Bowdoin are the business points. It is about 2 miles from the town line to the railroad station at Lisbon Falls, and about 4 to the station at Bowdoinham village. Bowdoin is supposed to have been settled some years previous to the Revolutionary war, and was known for several years under the name of the \" Plantation of West Bowdoinham.\" It was incorporated in 1788, when, \u2014 according to Williamson \u2014 it contained about 120 families. It was named in honor of Governor Bowdoin. The people were prin cipally of the Baptist denomination, and one of the first ministers settled there was Elden James Potter. There are now three meeting houses in the town, and two societies fully organized and holding reg ular services, namely, \u2014 the Free Baptists and the Friends. Rev. Nath aniel Purinton and his son, Rev. Albert W. Purinton, were highly esteemed citizens of Bowdoin. There are nineteen persons in town between eighty and ninety years of age, and one over ninety. Bowdoin has fifteen public schoolhouses, valued with other school property at $4,500. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $406,550. In 1880 it was $394,901. The rate of taxation in the latter vear was 16 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,345. In 1880 it was 1,361. BOWdoinham, in Sagadahoc County, is situated en the west bank of the Kennebec river, at its junction with Androscoggin. It is bounded north by Richmond, west by Bowdoin, south by Tops- ham, and east by the Kennebec. Woolwich and Bath lie opposite the southern part. The town lies about 8 miles along the river, with an average width of about 5 miles. The principal streams are the Abagadusset and Cathance rivers. The former rises in the northern part of Richmond and runs southward through the eastern part of Bowdoinham, parallel with the Kennebec. The Cathance rises in the northern part of Bowdoin, runs south into the middle of Topsham, then north in Bowdoinham until it receives the \"West Branch,\" then south to Merrymeeting Bay. Bowdoinham village is situated in the southern part of the town, near the junction with the West Branch. There was formerly considerable ship-building carried on at this point, and the business has not yet wholly ceased. There are in Bowdoinham three saw-mills, a grist-mill, a plaster-mill with capacity to grind eight tons per day, two clothing manufactories, a cheese-factory and about one dozen ice companies. Other manufactures are boots and shoes, tinware, carriages and harnesses, etc. East Bowdoinham, near the Abagadusset, has a railroad station and post-office. The principal rock in town is a felspathic granite. The soil is chiefly clay, with some sandy loam on the uplands. The principal crop for export is hay. Maple, birch and ash flourish in the woods. The Indian sachem, Abagadusset, had his residence on the point which now bears his name. It lies between the river of the same name and the Kennebec. Alexander Thwait purchased land of the In dians and lived at this place before 1656. He removed to Bath for a few years, but returned in 1665. It is said that during the first Indian war nine families living on the north shore of Merrymeeting Bay were destroyed or made captive by the Indians. Remains of orchards planted before this date have been mentioned by later inhabitants. The township of Bowdoinham was claimed by the Plymouth pro-"], [134, "126 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. prietors, who conveyed 3,200 acres of it to William Bowdoin, of Bos ton, but Sir Ferdinando Gorges had, in 1637, granted to Sir Richard Edgecomb a tract of 8,000 acres, situated near Merrymeeting Bay \u2014 then called the \" Lake of New Somerset.\" In 1718 John Edgecomb, of New London, appeared for the heirs of his name, and entered a minute of the grant in the book of claims. In 1756 the claim was again re vived by Lord Edgecomb, one of the heirs, who entrusted his business to Sir William Pepperell, of Kittery. The latter having died without settling his claim, his lordship empowered Nathaniel Sparhawk to pur sue it. Mr. Bowdoin, claiming from the Plymouth proprietors, brought an action to sustain his claim, showed title from the Plymouth propri etors, and a quit-claim from Abagadusset. The court ruled that this should prevail against the obsolete and indefinite grant made by Gorges, and Mr. Bowdoin won the case. This ruling and decision were in 1758 and 1763; but some years later the Superior Court ruled that this town was not included in the patent, the north line of the town beiug fixed as the southern boundary of the patent. It is also said that the Pejepscot proprietors claimed this territory and built mills within it. The settlement of Bowdoinham began soon after the building of Fort Richmond ; but its increase was much retarded by the wars with the Indians, and the disputes about the title to the land. The National Bank of Bowdoinham has a capital of $50,000. Orrington Lunt and Samuel Gray are among the most valued of former citizens. The salubrity of the climate of this town is shown by the number of old persons living here, there being thirty-three over eighty years old. It was incorporated in 1762, being named in honor of the Bowdoin family. The Free Baptists have two churches, the Baptists one, and the Methodists one. Bowdoinham has fifteen schoolhouses, the entire school property being valued at $6,000. The valuation of the estates in 1870 was $646,422. In 1880 it was $610,409. The rate of taxation in the latter year was twenty-four mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,804. In 1880 it was 1,681. BOWCrbailk, (No. 7, R. VIII.)in Piscataquis county, lies directly north of Foxcroft, but separated from it by Sebec Lake. Its boundary on the east is Barnard, and on the west, Howard. Its area, in cluding a part of the lake within its limits, is 26,880 acres. Birch Moun tain is its highest elevation. About one-third of its soil is suitable for cultivation, and some parts have proved highly productive. Mill Brook, the principal stream, has a saw mill and a grist mill. Mr. Bowerbank, a London merchant, was the first owner of the town ship who took effective steps to procure its settlement. The first actual settler was a Mr. Robinson, who put up a framed house and barn in 1825, and married and moved in in 1826. William Newell, a blacksmith from Hallowell, was the next ; William Heskith, the third, and Deacon J. Brown, the fourth. Religious meetings very early began to be regularly held, and in 1836 a Baptist church was organized. The settlers soon voluntarily took measures to build a schoolhouse, and opened private schools for their children. The township was permanently incorporated in 1839, taking the name of its English owner. There were then but about thirty voters, upon whom were imposed the burdens of muni-"], [135, "BRADLEY. 127 cipal regulations and high taxes. The town organization allowed of their sellingthe public reserves, by which they secured a school fund of $580, which still aids in sustaining their schools. The population de creased so that in 1850 it numbered 173, with a valuation of $17,376 ; in 1870 it was eighty-three, with a valuation of $15,000. In 1880 the population was eighty-six, with a valuation of $25,000. In 1869, at the instance of a petition of the inhabitants, the act of incorporation was repealed, and the township lost all organization.

Bradford, in Penobscot County, is situated 20 miles north of Bangor ; and on its northern, side adjoins Piscataquis County. It is bounded on the east by Lagrange and Alton, on the south by Hudson, on the west by Charleston, and on the north by Orneville, in Piscataquis County. The middle branch of Dead River runs south-east through the middle of the town, furnishing several water powers. The centers of business are Bradford Village, Center, East Bradford and North Bradford, each of which has a post-office. There are a saw-mill, three shingle, one planing and one stave-mill in the town. Other manufactures are carriages, harnesses, sole leather, etc., The nearest railroad station is in Lagrange, about five miles distant. The surface of the town is gently undulating, and there is scarcely any outcropping rock. Some pebbles and bowlders are found in the soil, which is a deep loam. Potatoes, corn, wheat and oats are chiefly cul tivated, and yield well. The principal forest trees are maple, birch, beech, hemlock, spruce and cedar. The first clearing was made in the summer of 1803, by James White and Robert Marshall, the first moving his family in during the spring of 1805. Jemison and Rogers settled in the south part of the town in 1804, and Wilson and Hildreth became residents in 1806. The set tlement was organized as a plantation in 1820, and was incorporated as a town under its present name in March 12, 1831. Bradford has a Baptist, a Free Baptist and a Methodist church. There are thirteen public schoolhouses, the total school property having an estimated value of $7,000. There is a high school sustained a part of the year at Bradford Village. The valuation of estates in 1870, was $233,734. In 1880 it was $252,413. The rate of taxation in the latter year was about two per centum. The population in 1870 was 1,487. In 1880 it was 1,460.

Nichols Pond, 3 miles long by 2 wide, is situated at the southern angle of the town. On the outlet are seven of the eighteen water-powers in the town, the other eleven being on Great Works Stream emptying into Penobscot in the northern part of the town. On these powers are one lumber, shingle and lath mill, one heading, stave and broom-handle mill, and five shingle-mills. On the Penobscot just above and below the town, are also numerous mills. By toll bridge across the river, Bradley has access to the European and North American Railway, on the western side of the river. Bradley was incorporated in 1834. The Free Baptists have a church in town, but the churches in Orono and Oldtown are so near that the worshippers resort thither largely. There are four public schoolhouses, the entire school property being estimated at $1,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $158,166. In 1880 it was $118,998. The population in 1870 was 866.

On the north is Waldoboro, on the west Damariscotta, and on the west and south, the town of Bristol. Bremen is 5 miles in length by 3 in breadth. Pem aquid and Biscay ponds lie on its western line, separating it from Damariscotta. Broad Bay in the north-east and Greenland Cove on the south-east are the harbors ; and at the heads of these are the principal settlements. Muscongus Pond, in the southern part, and McCurdy's, in the western part of the town, are the principal sheets of water. The surface of the town is uneven. Granite is the rock that appears in view. The soil is clay and sandy loam. The principal crop is potatoes. On the outlet of Muscongus Pond is a saw, shingle and grist mill. There are two porgy- oil factories. The occupation of the inhabitants is principally fishing and farming. Bremen is 16 miles east of Wiscasset. The nearest railroad stations are at Waldoboro and Damariscotta. The territory of Bremen originally belonged to the Pemaquid Patent. It was once a part of Bristol, but was set off and incorporated in 1828. William Hilton, from Plymouth, Mass., was the first settler, having moved in with his family, consisting of four sons and three daughters, in 1735. He was, however, soon driven away by the Indians ; but at the close of the war in 1745, he returned. Being an heir by marriage of the Brown claim,* he took possession of a lot on that claim ; and on this he resided until the last Indian war broke out (1754), when he removed his family to the block-house at Muscongus Harbor. Though this was 5 miles from his home, he still continued his labors upon the farm. In May, 1755, while he and his three sons, William, Richard and John, were landing from a boat, they were fired upon by the Indians, who were in ambush.

Then assisting his father and Richard into the boat, he returned with them to the block-house. Commodore Samuel Tucker, of Revolutionary memory, was a native of this town, and here spent the later years of his life. During the Rebellion Bremen furnished the Union cause with 27 men, of whom 12 were lost. Mrs. Mercy Studley, a resident of this town was, in 1880, one hundred and two years of age, \u2014 one hundred and six, she herself says. Bremen has a Methodist and a Congregational church. There are nine public schoolhouses in the town, and the total school property is valued at $5,600. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $162,437. In 1880, it was $190,387. The rate of taxation in 1880 was sixteen and one-half mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 797. In 1880 it was 839. BreW\u00a9r is situated in the southern part of Penobscot County, on the eastern side of the Penobscot River. Its dimensions are about 6 miles along the river, with a width of 3 miles. Holden bounds it on the east, Orrington on the south, and Bangor lies on the north- west, with the Penobscot as a dividing line. The surface is quite even, the soil generally a clayey loam, and considered good for agricultural purposes, especially along the river. The principal crop is hay. The highest eminence is Meeting-house Hill. The streams are the Segeun- kedunk Stream, emptying into the Penobscot at the southern part of the town ; Felt's Brook, flowing through the middle of the town to the river; and Eaton Brook, discharging into the Penobscot, near the north part of the town. The centers of business are Brewer, on the river near the middle of the town ; Brewer Village, at the mouth of Segeun- kedunk, at the south of the sown, and North Brewer, near the northern line. The first two villages have each a post-office. Brewer has seven water-powers, all on the Segeunkedunk Stream. The height of the falls, beginning with the first on tide water, are 20, 14, 4, 12, 10, 14 and 12 feet respectively. There are five saw-mills in the town, one using steam-power. These cut in the aggregate about 4,000,000 feet of long lumber annually. There are at Brewer Village two grist-mills; and here and in other parts are shingle and clapboard-mills, two planing and moulding-mills, three or more shipyards, two mast and spar makers, one boat-builder, thirteen or more brickyards, two makers of brick- machines, three carriage-makers, a churn and spinning-wheel factory, one machine-shop, one tannery, three shoe manufacturers, two stove and furnace makers, three ice companies, a marine railway, etc. At the beginning of the present decade, Brewer Saving's Bank held deposits and profits amounting to $39,922,07. Brewer is on the Bangor and Bucks- port Railroad, and is connected with Bangor with a covered toll-bridge. The territory of this town was taken from Orrington and incorporated in 1812. The name was in honor of Col. John Brewer, who, in 1770, made the first settlement at what is now Brewer Village. Other set tlers of this period were Isaac Robinson, Elisha Skinner, Lot Rider, DeodatBrastow, and Benjamin Snow, theHolybke, Farrington and Bun families. At the date of the Revolution there were already 160 inhabitants. The first post-office was opened in the village in 1880, with Colonel Brewer as post-master, \u2014 an office which he held thirty 9"], [138, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 130 years. The mail was then carried on horseback, and but one vessel was owned in the town. The \" Brimmer Flats \" opposite the mouth of the Kenduskeag River, is supposed by some to have been the site of the mythical Indian city, Norumbega, of which early voyagers to the Western Continent spoke rather indefinitely. Amonof former residents of Brewer we should not forget to mention General Joshua L. Chamberlain, formerly governor of the State, now for some years president of Bowdoin College; also Mr. Quimby, editor of \" Detroit Free Press \" ; Dr. B. F. Tefft, well known in the northern part of the State ; Mr. B. A. Burr, publisher of the \" Whig and Courier,\" Bangor. Brewer has erected a monument of Italian marble in memory of her soldiers who fell in the war for the Union. The Congregationalists have two churches in the town, and the Methodists one. The number of public schoolhouses is eleven ; and the value of the entire property is estimated at $11,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $669,867. In 1880 it was $735,169. The population in 1870 was 3,214. In 1880 it was 3,170. Bridge Water is situated on the eastern border of the State, and of Aroostook County, 22 miles north of Houlton, on the stage-line from that place to the Upper Aroostook. It is bounded on the north by Blaine, south by Monlicello, west by an unnamed township and east by New Brunswick. The township is near 6 miles square. The Presque Isle and St. John's road crosses the north-eastern part of the town. The Presque Isle River runs south-easterly across the northern part, receiving, near the eastern line, a tributary called Whitney Brook, from the Western part of the town. At the junction is a small village, and on a dam just below are a saw-mill and a grist-mill. One of the bridges at this place is about 500 feet in length, and is built of cedar. Bridgewater Post-Office is in the northern part of the town, midway from east to west. The sheets of water are two ponds lying near together, in the northern part of the town, called the \"Bridgewater Lakes,\" and Portland Lake. Each of them contains about 150 acres. The town has lumber mills, a tannery, a starch-factory, a steam flour mill, a buckwheat-mill, and other manufactures common, to small villages. The principal underlying rock in this town is limestone. The soil is a compound of gravel and light loam. Hay, wheat, oats, birley, buckwheat and potatoes are cultivated and yield well. This township was originally granted by Massachusetts, the northern portion to Bridgewater Academy and the southern to Portland Academy. It was incorporated March 2, 1858. The town sent 25 men to put down the Rebellion, of whom 4 were lost. The churches in town are Free Baptist and Methodist. Bridgewater has five public schoolhouses, the entire school property being valued at $1,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $83,263. In 1880 it was $103,406. The rate of taxation in the latter year was about 2 per cent. The population in 1870 was 605. Iu 1880 it was 722. BndgTOn forms the north western corner of Cumberland County, and lies between Long Pond and the town of Denmark, in Oxford County. It is bounded oh the north and north-west by"], [139, "BRE WER. 131 i Sweden and Waterford, in Oxford County, north-east by Harrison, south-east by Naples and Sebago, and\" south-west by Denmark. Long Pond separates it from Harrison, and extends nearly through the town of Naples to Lake Sebago, with which it is connected by Brandy Pond and a short stream called Songo River. Crotched, Upper Moose, Wood's, Ingalls, Otter and Beaver Ponds are wholly within the town. Kezar Pond lies on the north-western line of the town, and together with its feeder and outlet form the boundary between Bridgton and Fryeburg. The principal streams are Steven's Brook, the outlet of Crotched Pond and Willett's and Martin Brooks. The first furnishes the power at Bridgton Village, where are situated the Cumberland, Pondicherry and Forest woollen-mills, two grist-mills, two saw-mills, a shovel-handle and sash and blind factory, a foundry, machine-shop, hammer and cabinet-shops. 1'here are on this stream ten or more available powers, of which not less than eight are improved. Within a distance of a mile and a half this stream makes a descent of about 150 feet. The village is busy, thrifty and intelligent. The houses are neat, and generally have spacious grounds which are often ornamented with trees, shrubbery and flowers. The village has church edifices of the Congregationalist, Baptist, Methodist, and Universalist denominations. The schools are graded from primary to high, and their standard is well maintained. At the little village called \" Pinhook\" or \" Sandy Creek,\" south of the former, are a grist-mill, a saw-mill, carriage and boot and shoe factories. The Baptist church at this place is very pleasantly situated. South Bridgton consists principally of one pleasant street, on which are a Congregational church, and an excellent public schoolhouse. The manufactures are carriages and boots and shoes. North Bridgton is a prettily laid out Tillage at the northern extrem ity of Long Pond. This is the northern boat landing for the west side of the pond. The manufactures are cabinet-work, leather, lumber, meal, flour, boots and shoes, etc. The public edifices are the neat church of the Congregationalists, and the well-known Bridgton Academyr, which continues to flourish, though so many schools of its kind have ceased to exist. West Bridgton, at the north-western corner of the town, has a schoolhouse and post-office. The scenery in this town is delightful, both within and about the town ; and the pleasure and comfort and safety of inland sailing may here be enjoyed to the full; the boats running from Harrison, at the extreme north of Long Pond, to all points on Lake Sebago. It is now probable that byr the summer of 1881, a narrow-gauge railway will con nect Bridgton directly with Portland, which must prove a means of much advantage and pleasure to the town and its visitors. Bridgeton was granted in 1761, by Massachusetts, to Moody Bridges and others, being divided into eighty-six shares. Sixty-one of these were held by individual proprietors; one was set apart for the support of the minis try ; one, for the first settled minister ; one, for Harvard College ; one, for the support of schools ; one, for the first settler in the township. In 1767 the proprietors named their town Bridgton, in honor of Moody Bridges, one of their number. It had previously been called Pondi cherry. This is the name of a town in Ireland, but is said to have been humorously given to a tract lying between Long Pond and Pleas ant Mountain on account of its numerous j>onds and abundance of wild"], [140, "132 GjiZETTEER OF MAINE. t cherries. Captain Benjamin Kimball, in 1768, in return for the grant of a tract of land, bound himself to build a convenient house of enter tainment, to keep a store of goods, and to hold himself in readiness with a boat of two tons burthen, rigged with a convenient sail, to carry passengers and freight from Piersontown to the head of Long Pond and back, at a specified rate whenever called upon by the proprietors, for the term of seven years. The same year, the proprietors in like man ner, contracted with Jacob Stevens to build and keep in repair a saw-mill and a corn-mill \u2014 which he did upon the outlet of Crotched Pond, ever since known as Steven's Brook. In 1782, certain lots on the shore of Long Pond were given to those settlers, who by greatest progress in clearings and building, merited reward ; and these lots therefore have since been known as the \"merited \" lots. It was at the same time arranged to build a public mill at the locality now known as \"Pin hook.\" Bridgton was incorporated as a town in 1794. There being a steady increase in wealth and population. In 1805 that part of its territory, lying on the easterly side of Long Pond, comprising about 8,500 acres, was set off from Bridgton to form in part the new town of IlarrisOn. Again, in 1834, a tract of about 2,500 acres at the south east corner of the town was set off to form a part of the new town of Naples. In 1847, to restore Bridgeton, as far as possible, to its former dimensions, there was acquired ou the west, by annexations from the towns of Fryeburg and Denmark, a tract of about 3,500 acres \u2014 which territory is known as Texas \u2014 perhaps in reference to the State newly annexed at that time. The present area of the town is about 30,000 acres. The soil in general is very productive ; and the town can boast of many excellent and well cultivated farms. The \" Bridgton News,\" published weekly by its editor and proprie tor, H. A. Shorey, Esq., is an able and spicy sheet. The first minister settled in Bridgton was Rev. Nathan Church, who died in 1836, aged eighty-two. The Methodists, LTniversalists and Baptists each have a church in the town, \u2014 the Methodists have two and the Congregatioiwilists three. Bridgton is unusually well supplied with public libraries ; Bridgton village, and North and South Brido- ton each possessing one. Bridgton has twenty public schoolhouses, valued at $18,300. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $855,197. In 1880 it was $1,102 613. The pooulation in 1870 was 2,685. By the census of 1880, it was was 2,863. Brig'lltOll is situated on the eastern border of Somerset County, 20 miles north of Skowhegan. It is bounded north by Mayfield, west by Bingham, south by Athens, and east by Wellington in Piscataquis County. The only considerable eminence \"in the town is a high hill in the north-west corner. Kingsbury Pond, the head of Sebasticook River, lies partly within the sown at the north eastern corner. Wyman's Pond lies in the south-western part of the town, and Week's Pond, a square mile in area, lies just north of Brighton Centre. The latter is a small village, but the laro-est in town The Wesserunsett River, outlet of Week's Pond, has a fall near the centre, where its stream descends thirty feet in four rods. There is a stone dam at the head. There are also powers on Wyman Brook In the town are a saw-mill, shingle-machine and flour-mill, run by water-"], [141, "BRISTOL. 133 power, a steam saw-mill and a shingle-mill. Brighton is on the stage line from Skowhegan to Mooschead Lake. This town was originally a part of Bingham's purchase. It was in corporated in 1816. The town has Congregationalist, Free Baptist, Methodist and Christian churches. Brighton has eight public school houses, valued with other property at $2,200. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $91,727. In 1880 it was $71,930. The population in 1870 was 627. In 1880 it was 585. Bristol, in Lincoln County, occupies the peninsula between the Damariscotta River and Muscongus Bay. The towns of Damaris- cotta and Bremen bound it on the north, and Newcastle, Edgecomb, and Boothbay lie on the west, separated from it by Damariscotta River. John's Bay, and the irregular sheet of water extending inland from it, called John's River, make a peninsula of the western part of the town. East of this, Pemaquid River, connecting with Biscay and Pemaqnid Ponds at the north, divides the town into nearly equal sec- tions. Other harbors are Seal Cove on the south-west side of the peninsula, Muscongus Harbor, forming a part of the north-eastern boundary, and New Harbor on the eastern side, opposite the mouth of Pemaquid River. The long projection seaward of of the south-eastern part of the town is known as Pemaquid Point. Rutherford's Island, south of the western peninsula, contains a small harbor called \"Christ- mas Cove.\" On the eastern side of the town, and separated from it by Muscongus Sound, is the long Muscongus Island. The territory of the town is very large and the territory very uneven. There is much granite, but of a coarse quality. The soil is largely a clay loam. Potatoes form the largest crop. The principal pond is Biscay, form- ing part of the boundary at the north, and Burns' Pond, near the centre of the town, \u2014 both connected with Pemaquid River. The river itself expands into a harbor and empties into John's Bay. Bristol embraces the ancient Pemaquid, a place justly celebrated in the early history of New England as one of the earliest and most important settlements on the coast. The town forms about one-third of the Pemaquid patent, which was granted by the Council of Plymouth (England) in 1631, to Robert Aldsworth and Gyles Elbridge, two merchants belonging in Bristol, England. The patent covered the entier peninsula between the Damariscotta and Medomac Rivers to the sea, including the Damariscove Islands, and all others within twenty-seven miles of the mainland. The proprietors commenced the settlement on the peninsula on the east side of the Pemaquid River, between its basin and John's Bay. This peninsula contains 27 acres ; which, at that time, was covered with heavy forest trees. By 1632, there was quite a village at this point, and a fort of palisades had been erected. It was at this date that Dixy Bull, the renegade English coast trader, attacked and plundered the village. In 1664, Bristol was claimed by the Duke of York to be within the patent he held from the crown, including also Sagadahoc and New York. Sir Edmund Andros, governor of New York, and later of New England, ruled in this part of Maine fioni 1674 to 1682. In order to secure English control in New York (New Amsterdam), he transported many of the Dutch settlers of that place to Pemaquid. Here some of them were sent to garrison Fort Charles. This structure stood at the"], [142, "GjiZETTEER OF MAINE- 134 south-western angle of the village, in such a position as to command the entrance to the harbor. Gyles in his \" Tragedies of the Wilderness,\" says that he built a city at the mouth of Pemaquid River, and named it Jamestown in compliment to the proprietor, the Duke of York, subsequently James I. The government of the region was for many years located here. The great number of old collars that have been found, and some paved spaces as of a street, from time to time discovered beneath the soil, seem to corroborate this statement. Gyles also says that Andros built a fort here, which he named Fort Charles, and gar risoned with \" a considerable number of soldiers.\" In the spring of 1675, Kin\"- Philip's war broke out in Massachusetts, and by autumn had extended to Maine. The attitude of the Indians toward Pemaquid was threatening. By the untiring exertions of Abraham Shurt, a mao-istrate and very influential man at Pemaquid, the chiefs of the tribes dwelling at the heads of the rivers were induced to meet him in council. He promised them just remuneration for the furs which had been stolen from them, and security from future aggressions. The savages had oreat confidence in his probity, and the destruction of Pemaquid and the neighboring settlements was for a time averted. Neither side wholly observed their pledges; and several measures adopted by those having the control in Maine, the most important of which was the orders for the seizure of every Indian known to be a manslayer, traitor or conspirator.\" A ship-master having got possession of one of these warrants decoyed several Indians of this region on board, and carried them away with the intention of selling them as slaves. Shurt had warned the Indians of the designs upon them but to no effect ; and the warriors made no discrimination in their rage. A murderous attack was at once made upon all the settlements and trading stations along the coast, and they were destroyed relentlessly. \" Pemaquid, the centre of civilization in the wilderness \u2014 one of the first born cities of the new world, was to meet its doom. The torch was applied, and the infant city soon enveloped in one devouring mass of flame.\" The settlers returned at the close of the war, in 1678; but the settlement had scarcely been placed on a comfortable footing when the English Revolution of 1688 began, and England was again at war with France. The colonies of each nation in America were quickly involved, and the savages again burned with rage against the English. Pemaquid was attacked by the French and Indians and destroyed; the fort being battered down, and most of the inhabitants either killed or taken pris oners. In 1692 the place was again in the control of the English ; and Sir William Phips, a native of this region, and first governor of Massa chusetts under the second charter, commenced its reconstruction; erecting a strong stone fort on a point of land whose extremity' is marked by a large rock. Though so strong, the fort was in 1696 captured by the French by means of artillery, from the vessels and on the opposite shore. During Lovewell's war (1722-6) the fort became a rendezvous for the returned inhabitants of Pemaquid and vicinity, \u2014 though considerably decayed. Colonel Dunbar repaired it in 1729-30 ; but during the war of the Revolution it was destroyed, lest it might become a stronghold of the enemy. An engagement between the British and the Pemaquid people actually occurred in 1814. On account of various annoyances which they had received from the venturous yeomen of the place, the British"], [143, "BROOKLIN. 135 had for some time threatened Pemaquid. Accordingly on the 29th of June, the frigate Maidstone anchored in Fisherman's\" Island Harbor, whence 8 barges containing 275 men, set out for Pemaquid Harbor. Captain Sproul with about 100 men met them in the night; a dense fog enveloping the rival forces, so that neither the barges nor the men could be seen, except by the flashes of musketry. It is not known that any person was injured during the engagement, which lasted about an hour; but the British gave up the attempt on Pemaquid, and turned their boats toward New Harbor, one mile distant by land and seven by water. At their approach, the two boys stationed on guard fired the signal gun, and Captain Sproul and his men hastened to the rescue. William Rodgers, who lived near, called from the shore, warning them that a hundred Bristol boys would soon be upon them. They received his friendly counsel with ridicule, and the officer in command uttering an oath, ordered the bow gun to be discharged at him. The promised force was soon at hand ; and from the shelter of the rocks along the shore, they sent havoc among the English forces. The foremost barge being disabled, fell back, and another took its place. But finding they were suffering considerably while their enemies were secure, they gave up the contest, and returned to their ship without having inflicted any serious injury upon the Americans. The Maidstone hovered about the coast for a few weeks after this affair, when she returned to England,. where the captain was court-martialed and discharged from the service. \" for making an attack upon Bristol without orders.\" The inhabitants of Bristol are mainly of Scotch descent, with a mixture of Scotch-Irish. There are also descendants of the Dutch, some of whom were transported here from New Amsterdam (New York) by Governor Andros. There is also a sprinkling of German stock, who emigrated under the patronage of Waldo. At Bristol village are a lumber-mill, a grist and threshing-mill, a block-factory, cooper's-shop, etc. At Pemaquid are lumber, grist and carding-mills, a fish-oil and scrap factory, etc. South Bristol has three oil companies, a shipyard and a lobster-canning factory. Round Pond, on the eastern shore, has five oil and scrap companies, a sail-factory, and a granite quarry. The nearest railroad stations are those at Newcastle and Damaris cotta. There is a stage-line from those points to Round Pond, Bristol and Pemaquid. The other business points are New Harbor, South and West Bristol. There are two churches of the Methodists, one church of the Congregationalists, and one of the Advents in the town. Bristol has twenty public schoolhouses, and its sehool property is valued at $10,200. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $488,125. In 1880, it was $589,159. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2$ per cent. The population in 1870 was 2,916. In 1880 it was 3,196. Bl'Oad COVe, a post-office in Bremen, Lincoln County.

It is 26 miles from Ells worth and 50 from Bangor. The town has good harbors. In 1856, a lighthouse was erected on Flye's Ledges, but it does not now appear in the list of the national lighthouses. The town is rather rugged in its appearance, and its rocks show evidence of a paying deposit of phos phate of lime. The soil is gravelly, but strong and productive, and the inhabitants are giving more attention to agriculture than formerly. Hay is the principal crop ; and porgy chum has been largely used for dressing the land. There was formerly a large porgy business, but little is done in it at present. Smoked herring are produced in con siderable quantities ; there is a lobster-canning factory, a barrel-fac tory, and the manufacture of boots and shoes is also quite a business. The first permanent settler of Brooklin was a Mr. Black. His daughter Elizabeth, the first child born in the town, lived to the age of one hun dred and two years. In 1688, there were two families at Naskeag, Charles St. Robins and La Flour. Naskeag Point is frequently men tioned in documentary history, and there are said to be \" signs \" of its occupation at a time and by a people now unknown. The territory of Brooklin was set off from Sedgwick, and incorporated in 1849 under the name of Fort Watson. One month later its name was clanged to Brooklin. There are in the town nine stores of general goods, one of fancy, and one of millinery goods. The town-hall is a large building of three stories, crowned with a mansard roof. The Baptists have a very good church edifice, that is much frequented. Brooklin has nine public schoolhouses, valued at $4,500. The valuation of estate in 1870 was $186,899. In 1880 it was $177,534. The rate of taxation in 1880 was $14.50 on $1,000. The population in 1870 was 966. In 1880 it was 977. Bl*OOkS is situated near the centre of Waldo County. Monroe and Swanville bound it on the east, Waldo on the south, Jackson on the north, and Knox on the west. The area is about 25 square miles. The hilliness renders the scenery quite varied and pleasing. There are several fine bluffs, and some very beautiful views. Among the highest elevations may be mentioned Sprout and Oak hills, estimated to be from 500 to 800 feet in height. The ponds are Passagassawa keag, Half-moon, Corson and Clements. The first is the largest, hav ing an area of about one mile in length and half a mile in width. It is the source of the river of the same name, which empties into Belfast Bay. The rock is generally mica schist. The soil is a granitic gravel loam, and quite fertile. Hay and potatoes are the largest crops, but apple orchards yield well. The forests comprise a variety of trees, \u2014 maple, birch, beech, ash, hemlock, spruce, fir, cedar, oak, basswood, poplar, &c. The post-offices are Brooks and South Brooks. There are several small saw-mills on Marsh, Sawyer and Ellis streams. At Brooks vil lage is a clothing manufactory, a grist-mill and saw-mills. The Brooks cheese-factory is well supplied by the farmers, and sends out large quantities of excellent cheese. South Brooks has mills manufacturing, staves, shingles, long lumber and barrels. The Belfast and Burnham"], [145, "BR00KS17LLE. 137 branch of the Maine Central Railroad passes through the town, having a station at Brooks village, a little north of the center of the town. The territory of Brooks was embraced in the Waldo patent. Its plantation name was Washington. It was incorporated in 1816, and named in honor of Governor Brooks, of Massachusetts. Joseph Rob erts, from Buckfield, who built the first mills in town, was said to have been a resident here in 1799. In 1801, he, with his two brothers, John and Jonathan, were settled in town. Not long after Benjamin Cilley, with his sons, Benjamin, Peter and Simon, from the same town, took up their residence here. The first lawyer was Phineas Ashmun, who came as agent for Thorndike, Sears and Prescott, proprietors of most of the land in this and adjoining towns. He was also the first post-master. Jacob Roberts was the first physician. This town was the native place of Hon. Woodbury Davis, formerly a judge of the Supreme Court of Maine. It is claimed for Brooks that no town of its size has done more for the cause of freedom and temperance. The religious societies in Brooks are the Congregationalist, Baptists, Methodists and Friends. The town has seven public schoolhouses, and its total school property is valued at $2,100. The valuation of estates in 1870, was $200,176. In 1880, it was $229,437. The popu lation in 1870, was 868. In 1880 it was 877. BrOOkSVllle, the most south-westerly town of Hancock County, is bounded on all sides by Penobscot Bay and its connected waters, except on the south-east where it joins Sedgewick, \u2014 being al- most an island. The next towns to the northward are Castine and Penobscot, and on the east, Bluehill. The south-western projection bears the name of Cape Rozier, in honor of James Rozier, the compan- ion of Wey mouth in his voyage to the coast in 1805, and the historian of that voyage. The Indian name of this cape was Mose-ka-chick, sig- nifying a moose's rump. Mr. A. W. Longfellow, of the Coast Survey, gives this legend resjjecting the locality. In very early times, as an Indian was pursuing a moose over the peninsula upon which Castine is situated, it came to the shore, and leaping in, swam toward the oppo- site side of the harbor. The dogs were unable to follow the game, but the hunter himself followed in a canoe, and succeeded in killing it upon the shore. On his return, he scattered the entrails of the animal upon the water, where they may be seen even to this day, in the shape of certain rocks strung along at intervals. The waters of Castine Harbor and North Bay wash its shores on the north, and Bagaduce River, running northward from its ponds in Sedgewick, forms the boundary line on the east. The town is 22 miles south-west from Ellsworth, and 40 miles south of Bangor. The Deer Isle and Bucksport stage-line passes through it. The principal eleva- tions of land are Perkin's and Kench's Mountains and Wasson's and Clapboard hills. Perkin's Mountain is said to abound in minerals, yielding also alum and copperas. It is said that seventy or eighty years ago some mineral resembling coal was taken from its bed near the foot of the mountain and tested in a blacksmith's forge. At the foot of the mountain on the western declivity is a chalybeate spring. The granite quarry at the foot of Kench's Mountain affords a fine quality of stone. In 1875, about $26,000 worth of worked stone were shipped from this quarry. The \" Devil's Track,\" a peculiar formation in the"], [146, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 138 solid granite of this mountain, and the clam shells lying high upon Dodge's and Henry's points, and the mound on Henry's farm, afford themes for the curious. Walker's Pond is said to be a sheet of en chanting loveliness. It is also one of the best alewive fish pastures in the country. Parker's and Smith's ponds are also attractive sheets. A large proportion of the male population of the town are engaged in coasting and the fisheries. There is a porgy-oil factory at Buck's Harbor ; and in other parts of the town are two saw, two shingle, two grist-mills and a planing-mill, and one wool-carding, cloth and yarn factory. The soil of the town is chiefly clay loam, and the principal crops are wheat and potatoes. Brooksville was formed from parts of Castine, Penobscot and Sedgewick, having been set off and incorporated in 1817. It took from Sedgewick an eighth, and from Castine and Penobscot each a fifth of their taxable property. It was named in honor of Governor Brooks, of Massachusetts. Its history is largely included in that of Castine and of Penobscot. James Rozier was the first explorer, and 1605 was the year of his visit. The first settlers were John and Samuel Wasson and David Hawes, Revolutionary soldiers. They found three squatters already in possession, a Mr. Roax, Eben Leland and Arch Haneyr. About 1780, William Roax and Elisha Blake settled upon the cape. The first white child born within the present town limits was Mary Grindle, May, 1765. Upon Henry's Point and near Oliver Bakeman's, the British, in 1779, erected six-gun batteries. Both have been nearly obliterated by time. The first corporate meeting was held in John Bray's house. Col. John Hawes, Col. David Walker, John R. Redman and David Wasson, esqs. were eminent citizens. The Methodists, Congregationalists and Baptists each have a church edifice. Brooksville has nine public schoolhouses, valued at $5,000. The town valuation in 1870 was $238,987. In 1880 it was $207,443. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 2 per cent. The population in 1870 was 1,275. In 1880 it was 1,419. BrOWlineld is situated in the south-western part of Oxford County. Denmark lies on the east, Fryeburg on the north, Hiram and Porter on the south, and the New Hampshire towns of Eaton and Conway on the west. The Saco River comes down through the northern part, then turning eastward, forms part of the eastern boun dary. The Portland and Ogdensbuvg Railroad passes through the town, following the general course of the river. There is much fine interval land along the course of the Saco, through the eastern part of the town, and along the course of its tributary, the South Branch, through the middle of the town from the south- west. The ponds are Burnt Meadow, Dyer's and Rattlesnake, each about half a mile in diameter. From near the centre to the southern line is occupied by a group of seven hills. Burnt Meadow Mountain, near Brownfielcl Centre, is the highest, variously estimated from 500 to 2,000 feet. South Mountain is next in size. On the opposite side of the stream, in the northern half of the town is a line of three mountains. Frost's Moun tain, the eastern one, being estimated variously from 300 to 1500 feet in height. The western in this line is Tibbet's Mountain, and the middle one is Peary's Mountain. Whale's Back is a solitary eminence near"], [147, "BROWNVILLE. 139 the south-western angle of the town. These mountains are much fre quented in the season by the lovers of picturesque and extensive views. Farming is the principal occupation, yet there are many fine water powers in the town and many mills. The manufactures are long lum ber, staves, shooks, tubs and kits, basket-bottom rocking-chairs, meal and flour, clothing, carriages, sleighs and harnesses, etc. The princi pal business centres, are Brownfield Centres, (Brownfield P.O.), and Brownfield Depot (East Brownfield P.O.) An eye has been had to beauty as well as comfort in planting many shade trees, chiefly elm and maple, both in the villages and about single residences. Brown field is connected with Portland, 41 miles distant, by the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad, and with Bridgton by stage line Brownfield was conveyed by Massachusetts in three several grants to Capt. Henry Young Brown in consideration of his services in the French War. He was to settle 38 families therein by June 10, 1770 ; and in three years from that time to have a minister settled in the planta tion. He made the first clearing of land in 1765. The settlement was organized as \"Brownfield Plantation,\" in 1787, and incorporated as a town in 1802. The name was in honor of the proprietor. At the opening of the war of 1812 the population was less than 900, yet 25 persons, including 1 captain and 3 lieutenants, entered the American army. Of these, 4 died in the service from sickness, and 18 returned, 2 of whom were wounded. The first settled minister in Brownfield was the Rev. Jacob Rice, a graduate of Harvard College, who was ordained in 1805. \" Master Simeon Colby, the first schoolmaster, taught seven years in the single school-district, and was ever after held in rever ence in the town. Eminent names of a later date are Daniel Bean, Isaac Spring, Joseph Howard, Samuel Fisher, Daniel Goodnoe, Rufus K. Goodnoe, Judge Joseph Howard, et eds. There are women now living in the town at above ninety years of age. Several other persons are over eighty-five. The Congregationalists,Universalists ami Free Baptists each have a church in this town. Brownfield has fourteen public school houses, valued, with other school property, at $7,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $249,166. In 1880'it was $252,346. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2^- per cent. The population in 1870 was 1,321. In 1880 it was 1,229. BrOWllVille lies in the south-eastern part of Piscataquis County. Pleasant River runs from north to south through the western part. The area of the town is 21,320 acres. The stage route from the Bangor and Piscataquis station in Milo to Katahdin Iron Mines runs through the town. Brownville is bounded on the north by Township Number 5 (next east of Katahdin Iron Mines), west by Wiiliamsburg, south by Milo, and east by Schoodic Pond township, \u2014 the pond lying on a portion of the boundary line. The upland ridges constitute the chief portion of the town. On these the soil is stony but productive. Along the stream it is a light, rich loam. The productions consist chiefly of slate, of which three or more quarries are wrought. The Bangor and Piscataquis Slate Company opened the first in 1843. This quarry has sent out from 8,000 to 12,000 squares of slate annually, which sold in Bangor at from $35,000 to $40,000. When fully operated, it employs about 60 men, paying out in wages $25,000 a year. Merrill's"], [148, "Gj-iZETTEER OF MAINE. 140 quarry was opened in 1846. Mr. Merrill owns in connection 1,500 acres of land and has put up buildings to such an extent as to require 30,000 squares of roofing slate. About 80 men are steadily employed. This quarry is about 2 miles from Brownville Village, and sends its product by team to Milo depot. The Highland quarry, more recently opened, shows slate of superior quality. \"Many of the inhabitants are Welsh, having been brought in to work the slate, to which they were, accus tomed, and they are industrious, and in most cases, excellent citizens. The principal manufactories of the town are saw, clapboard and grist mills, a shovel-handle and a carriage factory, \u2014 at the village in the southern part of the town. The first two or three purchsaers of the township failed to meet their engagements, and it reverted to the State. In 1805, a Mr. Holland explored it, and soon after this it was purchased by Moses Brown, Esq., and Major Josiah Hills, of Newburyport, who commenced its settlement. In 1806, they built a dam and mills on Pleasant River, where the mills at t[ie village now stand ; and Major Hills, moved in and took charge of the business. Dr. Isaac Wilkins moved his family in in 1808, or \"earlier ; Rev. Hezekiah May, a Congregationalist, came in the same year, preaching on Sunday through the year, and teaching school winters. Deacon Francis Brown, from Newbury, Massachu setts, who came into town in 1812, was the first trader in the place, and a man who exerted a healthful influence upon the community. The inhabitants organized as Brownville Plantation in 1819, and in 1824 it was incorporated as the town of Brownville. The town now has a Congregational and also a Methodist church. It has eight public schoolhouses, valued at $4,400. Its valuation in 1870 was\"$157,626. In 1880 it was $212,452. Its population in 1871 was 860. In 1880 it was 896. BmilSWick is the most easterly town of Cumberland Count v. On the south it is bounded by bodies of water connected with Casco Bay. On this side lies Harpswell, connected with Brunswick by a bridge and a neck of land scarcely more than fifty rods in width. On the east lies West Bath, in Sagadahoc County, separated from Brunswick by New Meadows River. The Androscoggin River, in the form of a bent bow, separates Brunswick from Topsham, in Sagadahoc County. Freeport lies on the west, and Durham, in Androscoggin County, on the north-west. In the southern part of the town are several good havens for vessels, \u2014 of which are Maquoit and Middle bays. The Androscoggin soon after passing the falls in this town broadens and becomes navigable for vessels. Many of these have been built at Brunswick in the Narrows, and more in Topsham, on the opposite bank of the river. This stream is spanned by two elegant iron bridges, one of which is for steam cars. There is also a wooden bridge for both teams and steam cars. The scenery about the falls is quite picturesque, and the vicinity probably affords more pleasing drives than any other town in New England. There is here a natural fall of 40.83 feet (ensilv to be increased to 55 feet) within a horizontal distance of 1,980 feet. The rock occasioning these falls is a coarse graphic granite with gneiss, and shows some fine crystallization ; among others, large garnets, green fel spar, quartz, etc. Oak Hill in the western part of the town, the Pinnacle,"], [149, "PEJEFSCOT FALLS, BRUNSWICK AND TOPSHAM, ME,"], [150, "142 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. in the extreme west, and Ham's Hill, on the eastern side, are the prin- cipal though not great elevations of land. The eastern half of the town is level, and the soil a sandy loam, with a numerous growth of Nor- way pine. The western part is much varied with moderate elevations and depressions. The soil is chiefly a gravelly loam. All parts of the town are tolerably productive. The chief crop is hay. The manufac- tures are cotton cloth, wood-paper pulp, paper boxes, lumber, carpentry, pumps, soap, marble and granite work, carriages and harnesses, leather, furniture, boots and shoes, washing-machines, meal and flour, confec- tionery, ships and boats. The Cabot Manufacturing Co., organ- ized in 1857, owns most of the water-power on both sides of the river. The factory of this company employs upward of 500 hands, and pro- duces fine and coarse sheeting and drills. Below this are a grain mill, a lumber and carpentry mill and a wood-pulp paper factory. There are also in the village one or two paper-box factories, gas works, a grain- mill run by steam-power, and in the western part of the town is a plow-factory. Some $10,000 has recently been invested in a corn-can- ning factory. Brunswick was formerly a great lumber-producing, place, having had, half a century ago, thirty saw mills, besides cotton, woolen and grain-mills. It is situated at the head of tide water on the Androscoggin, and is midway between Portland and Augusta, being connected with these places, and also with Bath and Lewiston by railways. Brunswick is the seat of Bowdoin College, the oldest and best furnished educational institution in the State. It was named for James Bowdoin, governor of Massachusetts at the date of its incorporation, June 24, 1794. Five townships, situated in what is now Piscataquis County, were granted by the State for its support. Hon. James Bowdoin, son of the governor, some years later gave the college 7,000 acres of land, \u00a31,100 in money, his library, collections of minerals, paintings and philosophical apparatus. Rev. Joseph McKeen was the first president, and the first class entered in 1802. His successors have been Drs. Jesse Appleton, William Allen, Leonard Woods, Samuel Harris and Joshua L. Chamberlain. The scholarship has always been maintained at a high standard. Besides the classical course, there are scientific departments open to the undergraduate, and four schools to the graduate, viz.: letters,(including fine arts), science, philosophy and medicine. There is a military professor, and the lower classes are trained in military science and tactics. The library has about 35,000 volumes. There are some 250 students. The college has recently re ceived gifts to the amount of $110,000* Brunswick has one newspaper, the \" Brunswick Telegraph,\" edited and published by A. G. Tenney, of the Bowdoin class of 1835. * Among the many eminent names associated with the college, not one is more worthy than that ol Phebe Ann Jacobs, mentioned in Prof. E. C Smith's \"Three Discourses'\" During many years Phebe was a servant in the families of three college presidents but came to be treated in many respects as their equal. She had once beeu a slave, but was long known in college circles for her humble but absorbing zeal in religion. One year the meeting in February for colleges was appointed at six o'clock in the morniug Rev Dr Adams her pastor, at five o'clock to the vestry to make suitable preparations. He says: Phebe was there before me, had been tioo hours on the doorsteAi, waiting for the room to be opened, meanwhile listing up her soul in prayer !

The press of Joseph Griffin, so long associated with the college, has more than a local reputation. Numerous journals and newspapers have been at one time and another issued by him, and up to 1873, he had published works of the different presidents of the college to the number of seventy-eight. In addition to the noted men of Brunswick already mentioned we must note Hon. Robert P. Dunlap, Joseph McKeen, Esq., William S. Perry, and Professors Parker Cleaveland, Thomas C. Upham and William Smyth. Brunswick was first settled by Thomas Purchas sometime previous to 1628. His later dwelling appears to have been on Stevens's or New Meadow River, near the head of sloop navigation. He engaged exten sively in the salmon and sturgeon fishing on the Androscoggin River, having a fish-house between the falls and \" The Landing \" at Bruns wick village, and another at Lisbon Falls. The one in Brunswick was of stone. In this business he was associated with a London house. He also engaged in trade with the Indians. Before the breaking out of the first Indian war, in 1675, he had become a large producer of corn ; and, after the flight of his family, the crews of a sloop and a boat, which had come to his store-house on the shore of New Meadows River to carry away the corn, were attacked by the Indians while loading. In 1631 he married Mary Gove, said to be the cousin of Sir Christopher Gardner, who was for some years in Massachusetts and Maine as the agent of Gorges. Gardner was sent back to England by the Massachusetts authorities in 1631 on charges which were not sustained. Within two years he was again in New England, spending a part of the time with Purchas, at Pejepscot. It appears that the patent of land on the Androscoggin to Thomas Purchas and George Way was issued during Gardner's presence in England. This tract was four miles square on the river Pejepscot toward the sea. In 1636-8 Purchas was one of the councillors in Gorges' government of Maine. In 1639, fearing the Indians, he placed himself under the pro tection of the Massachusetts Bay government. In 1654 he submitted to the New Plymouth government on the Kennebec, and was one of the two assistant councillors and justices under that government in that part of Maine. In 1663-4 he was one of Archdale's justices under the King's commissioners. At the date of his first marriage he was about fifty years of age. His second wife was Elizabeth Williams, of Essex County, Massachusetts. He died in Salem in 1676, aged 101 years, leaving four children. His heirs sold his share in the patent (ex cept a certain reserve near the present village of Brunswick) to Richard Wharton, a merchant of Boston. Wharton also purchased Mericoneag Peninsula (Harpswell) of the Indians. He soon after purchased of Warumbee and other Androscoggin chieftains a quit claim of the terri tory four miles on each side of the river to the Twenty-Mile Falls, now Lewiston Falls. From Wharton, the patent and the purchase from the Indians passed into the hands of a number of gentlemen (mostly residing in Boston) who associated themselves under the name of the Pejepscot Proprietors; and from these and General Waldo, who had purchased the reserve of the Purchas heirs, the present titles are de rived. After the desolation of the first Indian war, the settlement was revived ; but it was again destroyed in the spring of 1690. The settle-"], [153, "BUCKFIELD. 145 ments were resumed in 1713-14; and in 1715 a stone fortification named Fort George was erected near the falls by the government. There was also a block-house furnished with small cannon near Mare (Sea) Point about this time. Yet in Lovewell's war, in 1722, the dwell ings were a third time reduced to ashes. The town was again re peopled in 1727. In 1735 there were thirty or forty men in town. In 1790 the census was 1,387. The town was incorporated in 1737, taking the name of one of the twelve States of the German Confederation. The first minister of the town, Rev. Robert Rutherford, was settled at this time. He was succeeded by Rev. Robert Diinlap, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh, who was ordained to this pastorate in 1747 by a presbytery in the French Protestant church of Boston. There are now in the town churches of the Congregationalists, Methodists, Baptists, Unitarians, Universalists, Episcopalians, Free Baptists; and Roman Catholics. Brunswick village has excellent schools, graded from primary to high. In the town are twenty-five public school houses, valued at $35,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $2,305, 806. In 1880 it was $2,684,374. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 16\u00a3 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 4,687. In the census of 1880 it was 5,384. Bryant's POlld, a post-office and railroad station on the Grand Trunk Railroad in Woodstock, Oxford County. BUCkfidd is situated in the south-eastern part of Oxford Countv, having Sumner and Hartford on the north, Paris on the west, Hebron on the south, and Turner, in Androscoggin County, on the east. Its dimensions are about 8 miles east and west, and 5 north and south. The area is 2,323 acres. The Nezinscot, or Twenty-Mile River, is formed from the union of its east and west branches, at Buckfield Village near the center of the town, and passes out in a south-easterly course. North Buckfield, the other village, is on the west branch. Falls Brook, a tributary from the western part of the town to the west branch, has a picturesque fall not far from its mouth. The Buckfield and Rumford Railroad passes through the town in a nearly north and south course, having a station at Buckfield Village. About one mile south of BuckfieldVillage is South Pond, about three fourths of a mile in length, and half a mile in width. Mud Pond and Jersey Bog lie near together in the eastern part of the town. Between these and the village is Fernald's Corner. There are more than a dozen isolated hills of considerable height in the town. The highest are Streaked Mountain which stands at the south-west angle of the town ; South Hill, in the south-east corner, North Hill, near South Pond ; Owl's Head Hill, south-west of the pond ; and Dean's Hill, on the north side of the town. The surface, especially at the western part is quite uneven. Along the streams there is some fine alluvial land. The soil is generally deep and dark, good for grain and Indian corn. There arerin the town several beds of magnetie iron ore, and of a mine yellow ochre has been opened. A limestone is also found yielding a fine quality of quicklime. Nezinscot, or Twenty-Mile River, and its branches have several fine water-privileges, furnishing power for several saw, grist and other 10"], [154, "146 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. mills. The manufactures of the town are long lumber, shingles, staves, box-boards, flour and meal, shovel-handles, snow-shovels, hand sleds, drag-rakes, brushes and brush blocks, powder-kegs, leather, harnesses, cutting-blocks, men's boots, etc. Buckfield Village is the principal centre of business, not only for this but for several adjacent towns. The first attempts at settlements in this town were by Benjamin Spaulding in the summer of 1776. Abijah Buck and Thomas Allen moved in with their families during the spring following. Others joined them, until in 1785 they procured a survey of the town, and purchased it soon after, of the owner, the Commonwealth of Mass achusetts, paying at the rate of two shillings per acre. The deed bears the date of November 13, 1788. Abijah Buck was agent of the pro prietors in making the purchase; and this, together with the circum stance that he and his brothers were large owners, led to the adoption of the name \" Bucktown \" for the plantation. In 1793 it was incor porated as Buckfield. Its first representative in the General Court was Enoch Hall, and the date was 1807. In 1816 great fires swept over this and other towns, doing great injury to the forests. The first preacher in Buckfield was probably Rev. Nathaniel Chase, who, having served until mustered out, in the army of the Revolution, made his way through the wilderness on foot, in search of a place to locate. The farm which he took up here has remained in the family, and is now occupied by his grandson. Mr. Chase was of the Baptist denomination and much respected among his people. He travelled and preached among the early settlers in Paris, Woodstock, Green wood, and in other places. He left a large posterity, among whom are the well-known firm of Chase Brothers, nurserymen, of Rochester, New York. The Baptist denomination has remained the leading one in town, having its house of worship at the village. There was a Baptist society formed in the town as early as 1821, of which Elder Nathaniel Chase was in that year the minister. There are now in addition, Universalist, Methodist and Free Baptist churches. Seba Smith, author of the famous \" Jack Downing Letters,\" and well knowu as a poet and journalist, was born in this town in 1782. Virgil D. Parris, a prominent politician in his day, a member of Congress for two terms, was a native of Buckfield. Hon. John D. Long, at this time in his second term as governor of Massachusetts, the son of Zadoc Long Esq., of this town, was born and spent most of his minority here. Buckfield has twelve public schoolhouses, valued together with other school property, at $6,000. The value of estates In 1870 was $554,673. In 1880 it was $397,598. The population in 1870 was 1,494 In 1880 it was 1,379. Buck's Mills, a post-office in Bucksport, Hancock County. BllCkSpOrt is the westerly town of Hancock County, and its most northerly town on the Penobscot. It is beautifully situated on the east bank of the river at the \"Narrows,\" forming a lovely picture, with its streets and houses rising on a gentle slope from the water. The summit of the hill is crowned by the'buildings of the East Conl"], [155, "BUCKSPORT. 147 ference Seminary, which, standing in bold relief against the sky, makes the most prominent figure of the village. The streets are very reg ular ; for which the town is largely indebted to Stephen Peabody, Esq., one of the early citizens. Bucksport has the only railroad in the county, the Bucksport and Bangor Railroad, which, in the winter season, gives Bangor an open port. A railroad to Ellsworth is also projected. A bridge of stone and timber 650 feet in length, connects it with Verona, formerly Orphans' or Wetmore's Island, in the Penobscot. It is popularly said that Bucksport is 18 miles from everywhere, being that distance from Bangor, Ellsworth, and Castine. The centres of busi iness are Bucksport Village, North and East Bucksport and Buck's Mills. The soil is uneven but not mountainous, and is beautifully diversified with ponds and streams. The principal elevations of land are Harding's and Picked Mountains, the first of which is 350 feet in height. The majestic stream of the Penobscot forms the western boundary; its shore being fringed with a narrow village for almost the entire length of the town. The soil is chiefly clay and clay loam,. and the principal crops are hay and potatoes. The business in which the largest capital is invested is shipbuilding. Other manufactures are lumber in its various forms, carpentry-trimmings, ship pumps, blocks, plugs, wedges and wheels, boats, cooper's-ware, carriages, leather,, boots and shoes, stone work, etc., Bucksport was one of the six townships originally granted by the sovereigns, William and Mary, to David Marsh, of Haverhill, Mass.,. and 350 others, citizens of Massachusetts and New Hampshire whose title was confirmed in 1764 by the General Court of Massachusetts.. In August, 1762, Col. Jonathan Buck, James and William Duncan,, Richard Emerson, and William Chamberlain came to the place from, Haverhill, Mass., and began the survey of the town. Col. Buck built a saw-mill upon Mill River, a small stream passing through the present village. Laughlin McDonald and his son Roderick, from Grcenock,. in Scotland, came in and took up lots the next year. In 1766-7, Asahel Harriman, Jonathan Frye, Benjamin Page, Phineas Ames and others came in and settled according to the condition of the grant, which gave to each actual settler 100 acres of land. The first preacher was Rev. John Kenney, who came in 1795. In 1803, Rev. Mighill Blood, became the first settled minister of the town. The village was partially burned by the British in 1779. Many of the inhabitants had previously been driven away by their incursions. The town was incorporated in 1792, as Buckstown, in honor of the leading citizen, Colonel Buck. The name was changed to Bucksport in 1817. A post-office was first established in 1799. The Gazette of Maine, one of the earliest news papers in the State, was published here in 1804. The Penobscot Bank was established in 1804. continuing six years.. The town- has now the Bucksport National Bank, with a capital of $100,000. Its public library contains about 1,700 volumes. Eminent among- the later citizens of Bucksport, but now deceased, were John N. Swazey, Jotham Moulton, Joseph Lee, Stephen Peabody, Samuel M. Pond, Moody Pilsbury, Henry Darling, Enoch Barnard, and Rufus Buck. The town furnished 367 men foAhe Union forces in the late Rebellion,, 66 of whom were lost. A beautiful monument of Scotch granite has been erected to their memory. The East Maine Conference Seminary was established in the village"], [156, "148 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. in 1851, and has done a good work for eastern Maine. Bucksport has three Methodist churches and one Congregationalist. The village schools are graded. The town has nineteen public schoolhouses, valued at $9,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,219,881. In 1880, it was $1,057,500. The rate of taxation in 1880 was $27,40 on $1,000. The population in 1870 was $3,433. In 1880 it was $3,047. Builker Hill, a post-office in Lincoln County. Burlington is situated in the eastern part of Penobscot County, 45 miles north-east of Bangor. It is bounded on the north by Lincoln, west by Lowell, and on other sides by unnamed townships. It embraces an area of about 48 square miles. The bodies of water are Madagascal, Suponic, Eskutassis and Little Eskutassis ponds, all of which are head-waters of the Passadumkeag, The two latter lie on and near the western border, the second in the southern part, and the first in the north-eastern. The three first have an area of about two square miles each. The principal streams are the Passadumkeag, which crosses the south-westerly corner of the town and empties into the Penobscot, and the Madagascal Stream, tributary to the first. Sunday Hill, which has an altitude of nearly 2,000feet above the sea, is the highest elevation of land. The bed rock is mostly granite. The soil is loam and loam}- gravel, and yields good crops of hay. Much of the town is still covered with forest, consisting principally of maple, -birch, beech, pine and spruce. Burlington is on the stage line from Enfield, on the European and \"North American Railway. The extension of the St. Croix and Penob- scot Railroad is expected to pass through the town. The church \u25a0 edifice is used by the different societies in common. Burlington has seven public schoolhouses, and the school property is set at a high figure in the school reports. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $91,507. In 1880 it was $89,041. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 17 milk on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 553. In 1880 it was 536. Blirullctlll is the north-westerly town of Waldo County, dis tant 30 miles from Belfast. It is bounded on the east by Troy and Detroit, north by Pittsfield, west by Pittsfield and Clinton, and south by Unity and Unity Plantation. Sebasticook River forms the boun dary line ou the north. The town is about 8 miles in extreme length, north and south, and the same east and west through the middle. The surface is quite level, and rather swampy. The few hills hardly reach 100 feet in height. Twenty-five Miles or Unity Pond in the south-east part of the town is about 4 miles in length, and 3 in its greatest width. Its outlet discharges into Sebasticook River at Burnham Vil lege, in the northern part of the town. The other village is Hutchin son's Corner, situated a short distance from Unity Pond. The Belfast and Burnham Railroad passes along the western shore of Unity Pond, near Hutchinson's Corner northward to Burnham Village, where it joins the Maine Central. Burnham Village has a large tannery, a lumber, and a shingle and stave mill, a shoe-factory, a brickyard, etc. The occupation of the in-"], [157, "BUjXTON. 149 habitants is principally agricultural. The soil, in general, is a clay loam. The largest crops are hay and potatoes. Burnham was formerly called the Twenty-five Mile Pond Planta tion. It was incorporated under its present name in 1824. Clinton Gore, on the north-west side, was annexed in 1873. Among its valued citizens have been Dennis and Elias Milliken, Ephraini Hatch, and others. Burnham has two churches, belonging to the Free Baptists and the Methodists. The town has ten public schoolhouses, and the total school property is valued at $3,000. The estates in the valuation of 1870 amounted to $175,007. In 1880 the amount was $204,248. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2 per cent. The population in 1870 was 788. In 1880 it was 967. BllXtOll is the most north-eastern portion of York County, having Gorham on its own north-east, Scarborough and Saco on the south-east, Dayton on the south, Hollis on the west, and Standish on the north-west. The town contains about 16,224 acres of land. Round Hill is the principal eminence in town. The surface is gen erally level and well suited for farming. Saco River forms the divis- BOtOTT EAGLE FALLS. ion between it and Hollis. The principal body of water is Bonny Eagle Pond, in the northern part of the town. It has an area of about 190 acres. The outlet of this pond affords two powers which are utilized by a saw-mill and a shingle-mill. There is also a saw and grist-mill on Little River near the centre of the town. The lower power on Saco"], [158, "150 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. River in the town is at Union Falls, or Pleasant Point, where the Saco Water-Power Company in 1856 erected a good stone dam, affording a power sufficient for 40,000 spindles ; but as yet it is utilized only by a small saw and grist mill. Two miles above, at Salmon Falls, are saw-mills, with a capacity of turning out 4,000,000 feet of lumber an nually. There are sites and sufficient power for many more mills. Clay and sand for bricks, and granite are near at hand. One and a third miles above are Bar Mills, where a narrow granite ledge nearly bars the passage of the water. The power is partially improved by heading, box and grist mills. Five miles above this are Moderation Falls, at the Village of West Buxton, where there are woolen, saw and heading mills. One proprietor at this place manufactures 7.000,000 feet of lumber annually. Clay and sand of excellent quality, and plenty of granite are near at hand. The woolen mills employ about 25 hands, and manufacture annually about 936,000 yards of cloth. One and a fourth miles above are Bonny Eagle Falls, with a power equal to 3,000 horse power, or 13,000 spindles for 11 hours a day. It is improved by a saw-mill with a capacity of turning out 4,000,000 feet of lumber annually. There are four villages in the town, Salmon Falls, Bar Mills, West Buxton and Buxton Centre. The town was incorporated in 1772 being named by the first minister, Rev. Paul Coffin, for his native place in England. Previously to that date it had been known as Narra gansett, No. 1, being one of seven lots assigned to the soldiers in the war against the Narragansett Indians in 1675. The number of soldiers \u2022was 840 ; and when the grant of No. 1 was made in 1728, nearly half were living. No attempt was made to settle the Township until 1740 or 1741, when Deacon Amos Chase, from Newbury, Joseph Simpson, Nathan Whitney, a Mr. Gage and a Mr. Bryant entered the plantation and began to fell trees and build log cabins. No one remained in 1745 when the French and Indian war commenced. It was not until the fall of 1750 that 7 men, with their families, commenced a permanent settlement near Salmon Falls. The dangers from the Indians were even then not wholly over. The season previous to moving in, these settlers had made some clearings and put in crops, mostly, it appears, on the river below Little Falls, whence they went to visit their openings occasionally to see if all was right. One day they found the door of their little fort open, which they had left shut. An experienced fighter of the Indians had told them that they should not approach and return by the same path ; and they now heeded his ad vice. After the war ended some Indians who came one day to trade told the settlers a party of Indians were hiding in the fort at the time the door was found open ; and that they had ambushed their path the next day and missed them. At a later time while they were still living in the fort, the men being absent one day and a night, there was an alarm given that savages were approaching. Mrs. Elden, wife of the cap tain, was quite equal to the occasion. She arrayed herself in regi mentals and taking a rusty sword, while the other women similarly donned male attire, arming themselves with old muskets and bayonets, whom Mrs. Captain Elden marshalled about the premises, giving orders in the most stentorian voice she could command, as if to officers and soldiers. This performance was repeated at intervals through the night and succeeding day until their husbands returned. The town"], [159, "BYRON. 151 has two Congregational and three Free Baptist Churches and one Metho dist. The first public school was established in 1761-2, under Mr., afterwards, Rev. Silas Moody. The number of school houses in town at this time is 17; and the school property of the town is estimated at $6,000. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $829,899. In 1880 it was $666,901. The population at the same date was 2,546. In 1880 it was 2,230. ByrOll is situated on the north-eastern side of Oxford County, forming an angle projecting into Franklin. On the south of it is Roxbury, on the west Andover; other townships surrounding are un organized. In dimensions it is about 8 miles long by 6 wide. Swift River forms from its tributaries in the northern part, and runs south ward through the east part of the town. The western part is largely drained by the numerous small streams that gather at the southern part in one stream, and empty into Ellis Pond. There are nine or ten mountains in the town ; of which the double-leaked Mount Turk (local name Turk and Broad) is the highest, being nearly 3,000 feet. Other names are Whale's Back, Pleasant Mountain, Durham Hill and Hedge hog Hill. Garland, or Little Ellis Pond, lies west of Mount Turk and Broad, aud just beside the centre of the town. A portion of Ellis' Pond lies in the town near the south-west corner Byron Post-Office is located on Swift River, south-west of Whale's Back Mountain. Above, on different powers, are two saw-mills. The nearest railroad is the Grand Trunk, with which it has connection by means of the stage from Andover to Bryant's Pond Station, 26 miles distant by road. It is about equally distant from Jay Station, on the Maine Central Railroad, with which it is connected by stage via Mexico. Byron is replete with wild scenery. The soil of the settled portion is quite good, yielding good crops of corn, potatoes, wheat, oats, etc. The forests of maple, birch, spruce and pine are still exten sive. The first settlers of this town were Samuel Knapp, Jonas Green, James Bawn, John Thomas, J. Stockbridge, Richard Morrill and AbrahamReed. The land was purchased by the settlers of a Mr. Brown of Newburyport, Mass. Skillertown is said to have been the Indian name. Bvron has three public schoolhouses, valued with land, at $500. The estates were valued in 1870 at $42,195. In 1880 they were set at $39,000. The population in 1870 was 242. In 1880 it was 191. CtllaiS is situated at the eastern extremity of Washington County at the head of the tide on the St. Croix River. It is bounded by Baring on the west, Robbinston on the south, and on the east and north by St. Andrews and St. Stephens, in New Brunswick. The St. Croix River forms the dividing line between Calais and the two latter places. The area of the town is 19,392 acres. The sheets of water are West Magurrewock Lake in the south-west, and East Magurrewock, stretching from the centre of the town southward, and about these, Beaver, Vose, and Round Lakes. Granite and slate are the prevailing rocks. The territory was formerly covered with dense forests of pine timber When Napoleon excluded the British from the Baltic, they resorted to Calais for the supplies of timber necessary to their ship"], [160, "152 GAZETTEER OF 31 A IN E. yard. From that day to the present the place has been noted for its lumber business. Within city limits are eight valuable water-powers, of which five are improved. These improvements consisted, in 1860, of saw-mills having a total of twenty-one gangs of saws, capable of cutting annually 55,000,000 feet of long lumber ; nineteen lath-machines, cutting 49,000,000 laths; shingle-machines, capable of cutting 2,500,000 shingles. There are also two planing-mills, one run by steam-power, one planing-machine factory, one saw-factory, two axe-factories, and four grain-mills. The aggregate annual production of the last is 70,000 bushels of grain converted into meal and flour, and of the axe factory, 600 dozen axes. The value of the annual production of Calais mills is about $2,000,000. There remains a large surplus of power unused, and a cotton-mill and other industries are projected. Other manufactures are bricks, bedsteads, brooms, carriages, plaster, ships, etc. There are two marine railways and one dry-dock. Being a port on waters navig able by large vessels, and having a harbor open nine months in the year, the facility of transportation enables the products to be placed in sea-coast markets at a lower cost than those of almost any other lumber-making place. At Red Beach are immense deposits of varie gated granite, which are extensively wrought, and about Avhich quite a village has sprung up. In 1872, besides laths, clapboard and shingle mills, there were in operation at Calais and Baring thirty-eight mills, mostly owned by residents of Calais. Calais is connected with the towns up river as far as Princeton by the St. Croix and Penobscot Railway, which will probably, in a few years, be extended to a con nection with the European and North American. A connection of Calais with the latter road is already made by means of the St. An drews branch, which here crosses the river by a bridge. There are also three highway bridges connecting Calais with St. Andrew and St. Stephens. Surrounding towns including Eastport, 30 miles south, are reached by stages ; and various sea-ports, east and west, by the Fron tier and International steamboat lines. The Post-Oflices are Calais, Milltown at the northern, and Red Beach at the southern border. The telegraphic connection is also good. Calais is a small, but pleasing city. There are many tasteful and handsome residences. Several of the streets have shade-trees of recent, and others ancient of growth ; and some have charming vistas. There is an odor of pine lumber about the city, with just enough of the pro vincial character accompanying to give a fresh and attractive flavor to the place. The first permanent white settler of Calais was Daniel Hill, from Jonesboro, Me., who made a clearing on Ferry Point. He was an athletic and fearless man, and had served in the Indian war of 1758-60. The Indians about him knew this fact, and greatly feared him, though he kindly aided and instructed them in their farming. Samuel Hill came in 1781. In 1782 Daniel Hill, Jacob Libby andJeremiah Frost built the first saw-mill, the location being near the mouth of Porter's Stream. There were so few men that the women assisted in raisin c the frame. Daniel Hill brought in the first oxen and did the first farm ing. By order of the General Court of Massachusetts, the territory along the southern part of St. Croix was, in 1789, divided into town ships. In June of the same year the township which is now Calais was gold to Waterman Thomas of Waldobrough, Me., for the sum of \u00a3672."], [161, "CALAIS. 153 About six years later Mr. Thomas sold half the township to Shubael Downes, of Walpole, Mass., one quarter to Edward II. Robbins, of Mil ton, Mass., and one-quarter to Abiel Woods. Subsequently Edmund Monroe bought a large portion of the lands of Downes and Woods. A few years later Samuel Jones re-surveyed the township and divided it into settlers' lots of 50 to 100 acres each; and Jones's lines still remain the boundary and farm lines. In 1801 Jairus Keen, from Duxbury, Mass., built at Calais the first vessel launched on this river, naming it \"Liberty.\" In 1803 a saw-mill was erected at Milltown by Abner Hill and others ; the machinery working so effectively that this be came known as the \" Brisk Mill.\" Stephen Brewer, Esq., of Boston, who became a resident of Calais in 1804 or 1805, was the first to ex port sawed lumber from Calais. He was educated, of good property, and soon became influential. He presided at the first town-meeting, was the first justice of the peace, and first post-master. He introduced the first wagon, and aided liberally in fitting and furnishing the first church. His widow, in 1815, received a chaise from the Boston friends of her late husband ; and this was the first carriage of the kind seen in Calais. Shubael Downes, Jr., a proprietor, constructed the first grist mill, and kept the first hotel. The first bridge across the St. Croix was at Milltown, built in 1825. The bridge between Calais and St. Stephen was erected in 1826. In 1849-50 a railroad was built con necting Calais with Baring, and a few years later it was extended up the St. Croix to Princeton. Calais was originally township No. 5. It was incorporated as a town in 1809, and was granted a city charter in 1850. In a later period, Frederick A., James S. and Charles E. Pike, sons of William Pike, an early settler, became distinguished in finance authorship and politics. Frederick represented his native district in Congress eight years, and James S. was several years on the editorial staff of the New York \" Tribune.\" Another resident of Calais, the wife of Hon. F. A. Pike, before mentioned, is the author of the novels, \" Ida May,\" \" Caste \" and \" Agnes \" ; and Harriett Prescott Spofford, of Newburyport, Mass., the popular magazinist, was a native of this place. Calais was incorporated as a town in 1809, and as a city in 1850 ; Hon. George Downes being chosen as the first mayor. Calais Savings Bank, at the beginning of the present decade, held in deposits and profits the sum of $172,651.47. The Calais National Bank has a cap- ital of $100,000. The \" Calais Advertiser,\" issued every Wednesday by John Jackson, Esq., is a sterling newspaper. It is republican in politics. The \"Times\" is a newsy sheet published every Friday by Messrs. Whidden & Rose. It is an organ of the greenback party. The first minister who preached in Calais was Rev. Duncan McCall in 1790. The Congregational society, was organized in 1825, and the first church edifice was built in the year following. Revs. Mark Traf ton and Jeremiah Eaton were among the first itinerant preachers in these parts. There are now several handsome houses of worship in Calais, and the usual religious societies to be found in a place of this size. The city has seventeen public schoolhouses, and the school pro perty reaches a valuation of $50,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,523,452. In 1880 it was $1,732,056. The population in 1870 was 5,944. In 1880 it was 6,172."], [162, "154 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Cambridge is the north-eastern town of Somerset County. It is the northern half of a six miles square township, the southern half being Ripley. Main Stream, a tributary of the Sebasticook River, passing through the original township diagonally toward the south west, forms the dividing line between the two towns. It adjoins Harmony on the west, Dexter, in Penobscot County, on the east, and Parkman, is Piscataquis County, on the north The surface of the town is generally undulating, with few high elevations, Ham Hill having the greatest altitude. The maple is the most numerous tree in the forests The soil is loamy, and yields good crops of wheat, corn and potatoes. Cambridge Pond, about midway of the western part of the town, is the principal sheet of water. Ferguson Stream, rising in large bogs at the north, runs southward across the southern part of the town, furnishing at Cambridge Village a power sufficient to run a saw-mill and a flour-mill. This village lies between Ferguson Stream and Cam bridge Pond, and is the principal centre of business. The place is 70 miles from Augusta, and 24 north-east of Skowhegan. It is on the stage-line from Pittsfield to Haimony. The nearest railroad station is at Dexter, 10 miles east. There are Baptist, Free Baptist and Christian societies in the town, and a Baptist and a Union church. Cambridge has five public school houses, valued with the other school property at $1,200. The valua tion of estates in 1870 was $109,182. In 188*0 it was $117,312. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 16 mills on th deollar. The pop ulation in 1870 was 472, and in 1880 it remained exactly the same. Cailldeil is situated on the west side of Penobscot Bay, and is the north-eastern town of Knox County. Rockland bounds it on the south, Hope on the north-west, Penobscot Bay on the east and Lin eolnville, in Waldo County, on the north. The area is 26,880 acres. The surface is broken and mountainous, and the Indian name of the place (Megunticook) signifying great sea-swells, is properly descrip tive. There are grouped within the town five mountains, spoken of in early times as Mathebestucks Hills. Mount Megunticook is 1,600 feet in height ; and of Mount Beatty, Bald Mountain, Ragged Mountain and Mount Pleasant, no summit falls below 900 feet above the sea. They range in general from north-east to south-west, and are more or less clothed with forest trees quite to their tops. The summit of Megunticook affords one of the noblest of marine prospects, embracing Penobscot Bay with its islands, Mount Desert at the east, and a vast sweep of the ocean on the south-east. These are possibly the moun tains mentioned by Captain Weymouth, as seen in his voyage in 1605, and by Captain Smith in 1614. They are visible 20 leagues distant. They are supposed to have been the boundary between the great Bashaba's dominions, situated on the west, and those of the Tarratines on the east and north. Mount Beatty, 900 feet in height and three fourths of a mile from the village, was during the war of 1812 furnished with a battery consisting of one 12 and one 18 pounder. Though there were no gunners qualified to manage the battery, and few soldiers in town, this appearance of readiness for defense kept the British in check."], [163, "CAM DEN. 155 In the war of the Revolution the place did not escape so easily. After the British, in 1779, occupied Castine, Camden became the only place upon the Penobscot of general rendezvous for the Americans. A small force was encamped here, believed to have been under the com mand of Captain George \"Ulmer, afterward major general of militia, state senator and sheriff. In one of their descents on the place, the British burned the saw mill on Megunticook Stream. They also set fire to the grist-mill, but it was extinguished by Leonard Metcalf and and a small party, who bravely drove the assailants to their barges. Camden was a part of the Waldo patent, and the township passed into the ownership of the \" Twenty Associates,\" becoming Megunticook plantation. It was surveyed by David Fales, of Thomaston, in 1768, and settlements were commenced a few years after on Goose River, Clam Cove and Megunticook, and mills erected. The first settler was James Richards, who commenced a settlement at the mouth of the Megunticook in 1769. Robert Thorndike together with Peter Ott, Paul Thorndike, Harknessand Ballard, about the same time commenced one at what is now Rock port village. Gregory, Buckland, Porterfield and Upham were the pioneers of the settlement at Clam Cove. The town was incorporated in 1791, being named in honor of Lord Camden a parliamentary friend of the colonies in the Revolution. Camden has six ponds, \u2014 Lily, Hosmer's, Canaan, Grassy, Rocky, and Oyster, containing from 65 to 900 acres. There are five con siderable streams and twenty-one water-powers. Fourteen of these are on Megunticook Stream, the outlet of Canaan, or Megunticook Pond, situated about 2^ miles from Camden Harbor. The stream is, however, some 3\u00a3 miles long, and in this distance has a fall of about 150 feet. The manufactures at Camden village consist of foundry products, rail road cars, woolens and paper-mill feltings, anchors, wedges, plugs and treenails, planking, powder-kegs, excelsior, mattresses, powder, barrel head machines, tin-ware, oakum, wool-rolls, carriages, boots and shoes, leather, flour and meal, ships and boats. At Rockport, the manufac tures are ships, boats, sails, capstans and windlasses, lime, bricks, tin ware, meal, boots and shoes, patent clothes-dryers ; and a considerable business is done in ice. At West Camden, are made corn-brooms, carriages, cooperage, meal, lime, etc. At Rockville, the products are carriages, and boots and shoes. There are operated in town sixteen lime-kilns, three shipyards, four grist-mills and six saw-mills. Lime stone is the principal rock underlying the soil. The latter is generally sand and clay, \u2014 a diluvial formation. Hay is the principal crop ex ported. Camden village is on the stage line from Bangor to Rockland, and is 8 miles from the latter place. The nearest railroad station is at Rockland. Camden is also on the steamboat line from Portland and Boston to Bangor. Each of the villages has its peculiar attraction in elegant buildings, fine situation, or streets shaded with trees of elm, locust, maple and horse-chesnut. The post-offices are at Camden village, Rockport, West Camden and Rockville. Camden Saving's Bank at the close of 1879, held deposits and profits to the amount of $145,672.72. Camden National Bank has a capital of $50,000. The \" Camden Herald \" is a spirited and ably conducted sheet, a good collector of local as well as national and foreign news. At this date it advocates the measures of the greenback party. It is issued every Saturday by W. W. Perry."], [164, "156 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Among the eminent citizens of this place in the recent period may mentioned Hons. E. K. Stuart, Joseph Hall and William Merriam. Camden furnished 300 men for the armies of the Union during the war of the Rebellion, of whom 90 were lost. The churches of the town number three Methodist, two Episcopal, four Baptist, two Universalist. At Camden village is an excellent new town-hall, having an audience room capable of seating 600 persons. The cost of the building was $12,000. In the villages are three libraries, and two book-clubs. The larger villages have graded schools. The town has sixteen public schoolhouses. The total school property is valued at $11,650. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,497,631. In 1880 it was $1,676,536. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 17 mills on the dollar. The popula tion in 1870 was 4,512. In 1880 it was 4,386. Canaan lies in the southern part of Somerset County, and is bounded by Clinton, in Kennebec County, on the south. On the west is Skowhegan ; north, Hartland ; east, Pittsfield; all Somerset towns. Canaan is about 10 miles long, north and south, and 4 wide. Its area is 15,891 acres. The surface is generally rough. The north eastern part is occupied by an extensive bog; the north-western, by pine plains. The chief eminences are Goodwin and Chase hills and Barnes's Ledge, each about 600 feet in height. Sibley, Long and Round are the principal sheets of water. The first lies across the eastern border, and is two miles long by one wide. Lond Pond lies on the western line, and is one and a half miles long by one wide. The water surface of the town is about 500 acres. The outcropping rock is principally granitic. The soil is a clayey loam, and yields excellent crops of hay and potatoes. The town has four saw-mills manufac turing long and short lumber, and one grist-mill. Canaan village, on the outlet of Sibley Pond, a little south-west of the middle of the town, is the centre of business. The place is 8 miles east of Skowhegan. It is on the stage-line to Pishon's Ferry, on the Maine Central Railroad, 6 miles distant. Canaan was a part of the Plymouth Patent, and was settled about 1770. Peter Hey wood was the first settler; and from him the locality became known as Heywoodstown. John Jones surveyed it for the proprietors in 177D. Its plantation name was Wesserunset, from the stream entering the Kennebec a few miles to the west. The name was chosen because the place seemed to them fair and fertile, like the land of promise. It was incorporated in 1788, at which time it embraced Skowhegan. The latter was set off from it in 1823. A post-office was first established in the town in 1793. The plantation records com mence in 1783. Benjamin Shepherd was it first representative in the Legislature. Among the valued citizens of a later period should be mentioned Wentworth Turtle, Levi Johnson, Sullivan Holman, and others whose full names are not yet forwarded. The town lost 18 men of her quota engaged in the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion. The Rev. Nathan Whitaker was settled in 1784, and dismissed in 1788 ; Rev. Jonathan Calef succeeding him in 1794, and remaining five years. Rev. J. Cayford filled the pastoral office from 1809 to 1813. There are now in the town Universalist, Free Baptist, Advent and Christian societies, who use the church edifice in common. Amateur theatricals and band concerts are the Principal public entertainments."], [165, "CANTON. 157 There is a public library of about 350 volumes. Canaan has twelve public schoolhouses, valued with the other school property at $5,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $346,395. In 1880 it was $350, 573. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 13 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,472. In 1880 it was 1,281. Canada Koad, a post-office in Somerset County. Call toil is the most easterly town in Oxford County. It is about 6 miles in width at the middle, and its greatest length is, north and south, about 9 miles. From west to east, through the midst, flows the Androscoggin in a zigzag course. In its great southern bend at the centre of the town is Canton Point village and post-office. On the southern side, at this point, the Androscoggin receives Whitney Brook, the outlet of Whitney Pond, which occupies a portion of the south-western area of the town. At a fine water-power on the outlet near the pond is Canton village and post-office. Here are Canton Mills, consisting of a saw-mill manufacturing short lumber, a shook and stave mill, and a grist-mill. Other manufactories are the steam mill of the Canton Steam Mill Company, a carriage and zinc wash-board factory, a foundry, a furniture and moulding factory, a tannery and several small establishments. The surface of the outskirts of the town is quite uneven, while the centre is smooth and level. Along the river and Whitney Pond and Brook is much fine interval, and the town is not surpassed by any for agricultural purposes. At Canton Point, the liockomeko oi the Indians, there is a large and beautiful tract of interval, which, at its first occupation by white people, showed the hills which usually mark long-forsaken cornfield:. The mountain situated north of the point was also called by the Indians \"Rockomeko.\" The tribe which inhabited here were probably a clan of the Pequakets, whose principal residence was Fryeburg. The Rockomekos were entirely exterminated by the small pox, during the war with the French and Indians, in 1757. Implements such as they used have frequently been turned out of the soil at this point, and a burying ground, containing many of their skeletons, has also come to light. Whitney Pond received its name from a hunter who had been wounded by the savages and left for dead, but had revived and crawled to a camp beside the pond. His companions, while in search of him, came upon the camp, and supposing the figure they saw within to be an Indian, they fired upon him, but on entering, found they had killed their comrade. The first efforts at settlement were made in 1790 or 1792. William Livermore, William French, Joseph Coolidge and Alexander Shepherd were among the earliest settlers. This township was included in the tract which first became known as Phipp's Canada. It was first in corporated as a part of Jay in 1795, but was set off and incorporated under its present name February 5, 1821. It is 20 miles north east of Paris, about 60 miles north of Portland, and 25 miles north north-west of Lewiston and Auburn. It is the terminus of Rumford Falls and Buckfield Railroad. Canton has Baptist, Free Baptist and Universalist societies, all of which have good church-edifices. The number of public schoolhouses"], [166, "158 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. in town .s nine, valued, with other school property, at $4,000. The valuation of estates, in 1870, was $395,993. In 1880, it was $367,693. The population in 1870 was 984. In 1880 it was 1,030. Caj)C Elizabetll is the most seaward town of Cumberland County. It constitutes a broad peninsula lying between Fore River, Spurwink River and the sea. Scarborough is the adjoining town on the south-west, Westbrook, Deering and Portland, on the north, and around the southern and eastern parts flows the sea. It is separated from Portland by Fore River, and Spurwink River cuts deeply into its south-western side. Its north-eastern projection forms the southern shore of Portland Harbor. The town, including Richmond Island, has an area of 12,881 acres. The soil is various, being in different parts a red, brown, and a black loam, with some sand and clay. Being near so good a market as Portland, the buildings of the rural districts have a neat and thrifty aspect. Great Pond and\" Small Pond, in the southern PORTLAND LIGHT. part, are the principal bodies of water. Richmond Island, lying a mile from the southern shore, was the first locality occupied by Europeans on this part of the coast. The first settler was Walter Bagnall (called \"Great Walt,\") who came here in 1628, occupying the island without a title. His principal purpose appears to have been to drive a profitable trade with the Indians, without much scruple about his methods. At length his cupidity drew down upon him their vengeance and they put an end to his life in October, 1631. Two months later, the council of the Plymouth Company granted the Island and certain other territory to Robert Trelawney and Moses Good year, merchants of Plymouth, England, who soon made it the centre of their American trade. The island was convenient to the fishing and coasting business, and it soon became a place of much importance. There is a record that, before 1648, large -jhips took in cargoes tor Europe there. In"], [167, "CAPE ELIZABETH. 159 1638 a ship of 300 tons was sent here laden with wine, and the same year Mr. Trelawney employed 60 men in the fisheries. In the following year, John Winter, the agent of Trelawney, sent to England, in the bark Richmond, 6,000 pipe-staves. After the death of Winter, about 1648, its business declined, and at the breaking out of the first Indian war came entirely to an end. The island contains about 200 acres, and now constitutes a single farm. In 1637, by the aid of the proprietors, Rev. Richard Gibson, an Episcopal minister, was settled on the island, and the necessary appurtenances of worship in the English form were provided. Mr. Gibson removed to Portsmouth in 1640, and in 1642 he returned to England. Many years ago an earthern pot was exhumed upon the Island, and within was found a number of gold and silver coins of the 17th century, and a heavy gold signet ring, richly chased, and marked by two initials letters. This ring has given the title to an historical novel by Dr. Usley, the chief action of which is placed upon this Island. The next residents within the limits of Cape Elizabeth were Richard Tucker and John Cleeves, who located upon Spurwink River in 1630, carrying on together the business of planting, fishing and trading. Two years later they were driven off by the agent of Sir Alexander Rigby, who had become the owner of the Plough, or Lygonia Patent, covering all this section of the coast. They removed to Casco Neck, where in 1632, they built the first house within the limits of Portland. Gibson's successor in his religious charge was Rev. Robert Jordan, who married Winter's daughter and succeeded to his estate. In administer ing upon this, for money due Winter on account of services rendered Trelawney, Jordan obtained an order from the Lygonian government to seize upon all the estate of the latter, and in this manner he acquired a title to a large tract of land, including Cape Elizabeth, which has never been shaken. The first settlers of Porpooduck (that part of Cape Elizabeth which lies upon Fore River), whoever they may have been, were driven off in the first Indian war, in 1675. The first re settlement appears to have been in 1699 by a few families only. When the French and Indians under Beaubarin were foiled in their attempt upon the fort in Scarborough, they turned to Spurwink and Porpooduck. At the former place, inhabited principally by the Messrs. Jordan and their families, 22 persons were killed or taken captive. At the latter place were 9 families unprotected by any fortification, and at the time of attack not a man was at home; and the savages here slaughtered 25, and carried away 8 persons. It is said that the crew of a visiting vessel first discovered these corpses, burying all in one vault at each place. The settlement upon Porpooduck Point commenced forty-four years prior King Philips' war (1775). Among them were several families by the name of Wallace. After its destruction in the third Indian war (1703), there seems to have been no settlement until 1719 or 1720. In 1734 a church was formed, and the Rev. Benj. Allen settled as minister ; and in 1752 the inhabitants were formed into a parish. Cape Elizabeth was incorporated as atown in 1765, but only with \"District \" privileges, which did not allow of a representation entirely its own in the legislature. The town, therefore, joined with Falmouth in the choice of representatives until 1776. It was represented in that year for the first time, the member being James Leach."], [168, "160 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Cape Elizabeth is the most interesting of the environs of Portland for its historic associations, its coast scenery, and its industries. It is connected with that city by a ferry at Ferry Village, at the north eastern part of the town. Near this is the breakwater, having a light house at its outer extremity. A short distance east is Cushing's Point Village, beyond which, at Old Spring Point, is the lawn-covered masonry of Fort Preble. The manufactures at these places are marine craft of all sizes, from boats to ships, boots and shoes, medicines, oils, extracts and fountain-syrups, etc. Knightville, on the next point westward, is connected with Portland by a horse, carriage and foot bridge. On the right, looking toward the city, are about 25 acres, oc cupied with the works of the Portland Dry Dock Company. One of the docks is 100 by 42 feet, with a depth of 20 feet, \u2014 said to be the WniTEHEAD CLIFFS. largest in the country. The manufactures of Knightville are meal and flour, boots and shoes, harnesses, tree and plant protectors, etc. The next point west is Turner's Island, whence the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth (Eastern) Railroad crosses to Portland. The Boston and Maine Railroad reaches Cape Elizabeth from Portland by a shorter bridge at the little Village of Ligonia, on a point north-west of the last. Here are the works of the Portland Kerosene Oil Co., occupying 2 acres of ground. The product of this factory is upwards of 4,000,000 gallons of oil annually. The other manufactory at this point is the extensive Rolling-mill of the Ligonia Iron Co. The mill employs about 200 men, and turns out some 14,000 tons of rails annually."], [169, "CAPE ROSIER. 161 The numerous shade trees along the public ways are a noticeable feature of the town. Most of the roads bear names well-known to the people of the neighboring city, whose gay equipages whirl along their smooth lines toward summer residences, or some of the numerous points of interest. The old Ocean House road, the Hannaford road, Spur wink road, and Cottage road, are the principal ones. The last skirts the eastern shore, and affords charming views of pretty cottages and sail-swept sea. A short ride from Portland Bridge brings the visitor to Cliff Cottage, and then to the fine residence known as \" Glen Cove.\" Passing Willow Cottage, we reach Cape Cottage Hotel, built by the poet, John Neal. Near by is the stone castle-like edifice of the late Col. Goddard ; and beyond is Grove Hall. A little further on is Port land Head Light, the oldest on the Maine coast, having been built in 1791. It is 100 feet above the sea-level, and can be seen 17 miles away. On the south-eastern angle of the town, is High Head, with the Cape Light a little to the east. The shore in the vicinity of Portland Head Light is high, rocky and picturesque. After storms many drive out to the Light to seethe huge waves dash upon the shore. A few years since two hackmen ventured out upon the rocks too far, and a great wave leaped up and swept them away. Their remains were recovered several days later, but fearfully mangled. The State Reform School, established in 1853, is located in Cape Elizabeth, and its fine building is a well-known land-mark. Parson Smith, settled over the first parish in Falmouth (Portland) in 1727, preached half the time on the adjacent part of Cape Elizabeth. The second church of Falmouth was the first of Cape Elizabeth, and was organized with 11 members in 1734. Rev. Benj. Allen was in stalled in November of that year, and remained until his death in 1754. Rev. Ephraim Clark succeeded him, and filled the pastoral office until his death forty-one years later. Capt. Arthur McLellan, born in this town in 1751, died in Portland in 1833. He was widely known as a successful shipmaster and a wealthy merchant. Other respected citizens have been Col. Charles Hannaford, and Esquires Samuel Haskell, Scott Dyer, Thomas E. Knight, and John Fickett. The churches at present are four Methodist, two Congregation alist, one Free Baptist and the Welsh Church, \u2014 the latter society being chiefly the workmen in the Rolling-mill and their families. Cape Elizabeth has an excellent town-hall, a brick building two stories in height. The town high school occupies a portion of the second story, and above this is the Masonic Hall. The town has fifteen public schoolhouses, valued at $4,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,784,831. In 1880 it was $1,869,199. The rate of taxation in 1880 was $1.72 on $100.

The soil is a dark loam, yielding excellent crops of wheat, oats and potatoes. Maple, birch, cedar and spruce form the bulk of the forest trees. The Aroostook River passes up through the southern half to the centre of the town, then turning to the south-east, passes out on the eastern side. Caribou Stream enters from the west, dis charging into the Aroostook at Caribou Village, near the center of the town. The Little Madawaska River comes down through the northern part of the town, forming a junction with the Aroostook near the eastern line. Otter Brook flows in from the north-west be tween the two other streams ; while near the southern line of the town Hardwood Creek comes into the Aroostook from the west. There are several other streams of considerable size, forming a remarkable confluence of water-courses, several of which afford some available water-power. There are mills on the Little Madawaska near the middle of the town, on the eastern side, and on Otter Brook, near its junction with the Aroostook ; but the large number are on Caribou Stream, at Caribou Village. There are here saw, planing, carpentry, shingle and grist mills, and a starch-factory, four of which are run by steam-power. Boots and shoes and harnesses are the principal other manufactures. This town is the terminus of the New Brunswick Railway from Frederickton and Woodstock, N. B., and of stage-lines to Van Buren, New Sweden, and Fort Fairfield. It was incorporated April 5, 1859.

It is bounded on the north by Weld, east by Perkin's Plantation, Number Four, and Wilton, and south by Mexico and Dixfield, in Oxford County. Across the broad pine-covered plain in the northern and middle part, runs, in a tortuous course southward, Webb's River, the outlet of Webb's Pond. The eastern part of the town is hilly, but the soil in general is moderately good. There is much lime stone in the town ; and near the centre is a quarry which has been worked to some extent. Running nearly north and south in the east ern part of the town is a range of lofty hills, variously known as the Bear, Saddleback, or Blueberry. The principal village is Berry's Mills, on Webb's River, in the western part of the town, \"it is 29 miles south-west of Farmington, and is connected by stage-line with the An droscoggin Railroad at North Jay. There are here a grist-mill and two lumber and box-mills. Carthage was formerly Number Four, Abbott's Purchase. Later, Dr."], [173, "CASTINE. 165 Perkins, of Farmington, became the proprietor of the unsold land. The first settlers were William Bowley and a Mr. Winter, the former of whom built what are called \"Bowley's Mills\" on Webb's River. The town was lotted by Samuel Adams in 1803. There are two post-offices, South Carthage and Berry's Mills. There are Baptist and Free Baptist societies in the town. Carthage has six public schoolhouses. valued with other school property, at $2,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $96,070. In 1880 it was $107,823. The population in 1870 was 486. In 1880 it was 507. Cai*y, a postroffice in Aroostook County, CaSCO, in Cumberland County, lies between Thompson's Pond, and the northern side of Lake Sebago. Raymond lies on the east, and Naples and Otisfield on the west. Crooked and Songo rivers separate it from Naples ; Thomas Pond lies on the south-eastern line adjoining Raymond ; and across the northern part of the town is a semicircle of small ponds. The first on the western side is Pleasant Pond, which is partly in Otisfield. To this succeeds Owl, Parkers, Coffee, Dumplin, Edwards and other ponds, while Thompson's Pond covers about one third of the northern line. Crooked and Casco rivers, and the outlet of most of the ponds furnish small powers. The total number of powers in town is twenty-one, of which nearly all are improved. The manufactures are house-lumber, boxes, shooks, axe-handles, spokes, staves, meal, flour, clothing and carriages. The surface of the town is uneven, and the soil is hard and rocky, but moderately productive. Quito Hill \u2014 about 500 feet in height \u2014 is the principal elevation. The business centres are Casco Village and Webb's Mills. Casco is 30 miles north-west of Portland. It is on Davis stage-line from Oxford, on Grand Trunk Railway, to Naples. Casco was formely a part of Raymond, from which it was taken and incorporated in 1841. It is one of the smallest towns of the county, containing but little above three square miles. There are societies of the Congregationalists, Gen. Prov., Baptists, and Free Baptists in this town. Casco has eight public schoolhouses, valued at $3,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $241,486. The population at the same date was 998. In 1880 it was 908, having lost 90 of its inhabitants during the last ten years. CaSCO Bay for description, see article or Cumberland County. Castine occupies a peninsula in the south-western portion of Hancock County, overlooking the eastern entrance of Penobscot River. The town of Penobscot bounds it on the north-east, and Castine Harbor separates it from Brooksville on the south and south-east. On the west is Penobscot Bay. Castine is 30 miles from Ellsworth, 18\u00a3 miles from the railroad station at Bucksport, and 36 miles from Bangor. The Boston steamers run regularly to this port through the year, rarely missing a trip. The foundation rocks are slate, trap, mica schist, gneiss and granite. The soil is a sandy loam. The principal crops are hay and potatoes."], [174, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 166 The village of Castine occupies a commanding position on the eastern side of the peninsula, which gradually ascends from the shore to the height of 217 feet. On the north the shore is more precipitous. At the summit is a rectangular line of hillocks, the remains of Fort George. On the southward shore below are the nearly effaced ruins of Castine's fort, built as early, probably, as 1626 ; and at several ]>oints are the remains of batteries erected during the Revolution. The lighthouse and an old block-house are also points to be noted. The whole southward side of the peninsula formerly abounded in ancient relics, articles of Indian manufacture, cannon balls, shells, etc. There is an orchard in town, planted in 1784, which still bears good fruit. The streets of the village are set with shade trees of all ages, and the buildings are in good repair. Many of the dwellings are large and old, and there is an air of elegance and repose. Before it spreads out the grand harbor, dotted with islands. The depth of the water and the movement of the tide, make it an open harbor for largo vessels at all seasons, with rare exceptions. The business is chiefly related to the fisheries. There is one saw-mill and one grist-mill, a large brickyard, two canning-factories for putting up lobsters, clams and other fish; a rope-walk, and a cod and mackerel line factory, \u2014 the latter doing a business of $20,000 annually. At the head of the peninsula is a light house of stone, tuning a flashing, white light. For a quiet sum mer resort, Castine is equal to any point on the coast. The climate is very healthy, and old people abound. It is now made the terminus of numerous summer excursions; and picnicing parties find it a very convenient and attractive locality. The history of Castine goes back to the earliest settlement of our coast. The French explorer, Theve't, who visited the Penobscot in 1555, refers to an old French fort in this vicinity. Its neighborhood was explored by James Rosier in 1605 ; and in 1626 a trading house was established here by Isaac Allerton, under the direction of the Plymouth colony of Massachusetts. In 1632, the house was surprised and rifled by the French under Rosillon. Having been re-stocked, in 1635 it was attacked and occupied by another Frenchman, D'Aulnev, deputy governor in Acadia. From 1643 to 1651, it was sometimes the scene of the conflict waged between D'Aulney and La Tour, rival proprietors, the first a Romanist, the latter nominally a Huguenot. In 1648 Friar Leo laid the corner stone of a Capuchin chapel. The place was taken by the English again in 1654. In 1667 Baron Castine arrived upon Penobscot Bay, the region being then known as Pent i goet; and in 1670 Fort Pentagbet, at what is now Castine, was was formally surrendered by Colonel Temple to Grandfontaine, who represented the French government. In 1673, the place had 31 white inhabitants ; and the next year it was taken by a Flemish vessel com manded by Captain Jurriaen Aernoots. Yet in 1687, we again find Castine in possession, when he was noti fied by the Government of New England to surrender the place to them. Two years later the heights of this peninsula were the scene of the torture of Thomas Gyles by the Indians. The locality began about this time to be called Biguaduce, later, Bagaduce, from Marche-Big uatus, an Indian term supposed to mean \" no good cove.\" Sir Wil liam Phipps took possession of the place in 1690. In 1693 Castine was again in possession, aud temporarily gave in his adhesion to the Eng-"], [175, "CASTINE. 167 lish. In 1703, the English plundered the house of Anselm Castin, eldest son of the baron, the latter having returned to France. Anselm himself in 1722, went to France, to succeed to his father's estate, and another son, Joseph Dabadis St. Castin, was left in possession of the Acadian estate. In 1779, Bagaduce was assailed by General Francis McLean with 700 men, in a fleet of seven or eight sail. Their landing was made in front of Joseph Perkins' house, which stood on what is now the south-east corner of Maine and Water streets. Having forti fied the place, the British were attacked late in the following July, by a force fitted up by Massachusetts, consisting of a fleet of 19 armed vessels and 24 transports, carrying 344 guns, under Dudley Saltonstall, and a land force of about 1,200 men, under Gen. Samuel Lovell, seconded by Gen. Peleg Wadsworth ; Col. Paul Revere having charge of the ordnance. The most striking action of this siege was the storming of the bluff by the Americans, by which they gained a permanent lodge ment on the peninsula, but with the loss of over 100 of their number. They advanced their works, with continued success, upon the exten sive fortifications of the enemy ; and the siege failed of its object only by the insubordination of the captains of the fleet, and the over-caution of the commander. At length a fleet of British ships arrived, and Sal tonstall's ill-governed vessels made haste to escape, and were in con sequence nearly all captured by the British, or run ashore and burned. The land force escaped across the river above, and thence through the woods to the Kennebec. This was the noted \" Penobscot expedition,\" the greatest display and the greatest failure of the Americans in New England during the war. The escape of Gen. Wadsworth and Colonel Burton from their imprisonment in Fort George in June, 1780, is one of the oft-related incidents of Castine history. A fort was built here about 1811 by the Americans, which was occupied by the British jn 1814-15, and called by them Fort Castine. During the late civil war it was rebuilt and garrisoned by a company of U. S. troops. It was at one time called Fort Porter. The town of Penobscot, which included Castine, was incorporated in 1787 ; and in 1788 it was first represented in the General Court, the representative being Ge< rge Thatcher. Penobscot was made a collec tion district of the United States in 1789. The town of Castine was set off and incorporated in 1796, and was also made the shire town of the county. In 1814, the town was again occupied by the British, who held it undisturbed until April 28, 1816, more than four months after the treaty of peace. No place in Maine has experienced so many vicissitudes as Castine. It has been held successively by the Indians, French, Dutch and English; and many naval engagements have taken place in its harbor. After the Revolution, Castine became rapidly settled, and for a long time it was the most important mart of business in the eastern part of Maine. Shipbuilding was formerly a leading industry, and the fitting out of vessels for the Grand Banks was carried on largely. In 1838 the courts were removed to Ellsworth, the act granting bounty to fishermen was repealed and shipbuilding declined, all contributing to the commercial injury of the place. Isaac Parker, of Castine, was the first lawyer in the county, and represented the district in Congress from 1796 to 1798. Hezekiah Williams, also a respected member of the Hancock bar, was represen-"], [176, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 168 tative from 1845 to 1849. William Abbott, who settled in the town in 1801, was a sound, able and honorable lawyer. Dr. Joseph L. Stevens was for many years the leading physician and a valued citizen. Dr. G. A. Wheeler, author of the excellent history of Castine, has suc ceeded to his practice. Others highly esteemed are C. J. Abbott, Esq., Deacon Samuel Adams, William Withered, a well-known merchant. The town furnished 106 soldiers and 19 sailors for the Union in the war of the Rebellion, of whom 18 soldiers were lost. Rev. William Mason, the first minister of Castine, was ordained as a Congregationalist, but became Unitarian ; and Castine has now one of the two Unitarian churches in the county. There are now also Congregationalist (Trinitarian) and Methodist churches in the village. The church-edifices are fine buildings. A State Normal School was opened here in 1873, with accommodations for 200 pupils. It is well patronized. The schools of the village are graded, and a high-school is sustained. The town has six schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $10,000. The valuation of real estates in 1870 was $461, 343. In 1880 it was $362,754.

There is a saw and grist mill on this stream, toward the southern part of the town. In the northern part is one of the United States military asylums. The mineral spring at this place formerly had some notoriety, and Mr. Beal, of Boston, erected a large hotel near it. The enterprise did not prove profitable, and the property was sold to the United States ; the territory also being ceded to the Government for the purposes of a Home for the disabled soldiers of the war of the Rebellion. A fire destroyed the old buildings, which were of wood, and substantial brick buildings were soon after erected, of size sufficient to accommodate 1,000 men.

Chester is situated on the west bank of the Penobscot Rivcr> near the middle of Penobscot County, and 56 miles N.N.E. of Bangor- The town is triangular in form, its base extending about 10 miles along the river. Opposite, on the eastern side of the river, are Winn and Lincoln,\u2014 the latter having a station of the European and North Ameri can Railway. Other sides are bounded by unnamed townships. Katahdin Horseback, about 200 feet in height, is the most notable eminence. A large stream runs through this, cutting a notch down to its base. The principal streams are Medunkeunk and Eber Horse Stream, the latter a tributary of the first. Medunkeunk has a pretty cataract of 12 feet, and both streams afford water-powers which have been improved, in time past, by several mills. The underlying rock is slate. The soil is a clayey loam, and quite fertile. Potatoes are the crop chiefly cultivated. The forests are composed mainly of poplar and white birch. Along some of the highways grow rock maple, elm and English willow, from a dozen to forty years old. Chester was incorporated in 1834. It has nine residents who are above eighty years of age.

Chesterville, the south-eastern town of Franklin County, is bounded north by Farmington, east by New Sharon, west by Jay, and south by Fayette, in Kennebec County. The town is about 8 miles long, and nearly 6 in width at the northern end, \u2014 the area being about 19,000 acres. In the centre of the town the land is mostly flat and low. There is considerable swamp and bog as well as meadow land. The hills are generally stony, and lie at each end of the town. Moose Hill, in the south-west corner of the town, is about 800 feet above sea-level, but its highest point is in East Livermore. A spur of Blabon Hill is supposed to be the highest land in Chesterville. It is composed almost wholly of granite, large quantities of which are annually quarried and wrought into building material. Another emi nence called \" The Bluff \" lies near Sand Pond, and is an almost per pendicular ledge, being about 100 feet high and 30 rods long. There ia"], [182, "174 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. a horseback in the town 5 miles long and 25 feet high. Granite is the principal rock, of which there is much of a fine quality quarried. The soil is sandy, or a sandy loam. Pine is the most numerous wood, but alternating with hemlock, maple, birch and poplar. The town is marked by numerous small ponds, of which there are said to be upwards of twenty. The largest of these is Parker's Pond, lying at the south-eastern boundary of the town. Norcross Pond, the next in size, has an area of about one-third of a square acre. The others are Sheldrake, McGurdy, Lock's, Sand, Parkhurst, Moosehorn, etc. The streams are Wilson's, which forms the line of division from Farming- ton ; McGurdy's, which marks the line between Chesterville and Vienna, also the former and New Sharon ; Little Norridgewock, which rises in Norcross Pond in the south part of the town, running north- ward midway of the territory to Wilson's Stream, yvhich discharges into Sandy River. The village of Farmington Falls is partly in Farmington and partly in Chesterville. The manufactures here are lumber, sash and blinds, spools, wrought granite, pumps, excelsior, potash, etc. At South Chesterville, situated on Parker's Pond, there are a lumber- mill and a grist-mill. North Chesterville, or Keith's Mills, on Wilson's Stream, is the centre of the wholesale manufacture of wagons and sleighs, which have a reputation throughout the State. The machine work is done at the village, but the larger part of the labor is performed on the neighboring farms; thus mingling the labors of the farm and the shop. The village is partly in Farmington, and is charm- ingly situated, being surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills, through which the stream winds like a silver thread, or anon spreads out broad and pond-like. Other industries are carding and cloth-dressing, a grain-mill, cabinet and furniture making. There is here a beautiful village Union church, containing a bell that was given by Rev. Jotham Sewall, \u2014 widely known as \"Father Sewall,\" and sometimes spoken of as the \" Ap stle of Maine,\" \u2014 whose remains lie entombed in the outskirts of the village. There is a small library here. Chesterville Centre is a pretty village, with a fine church, situated on the Little Norridgewock. Here also is a large tannery for sheepskins, which are carried in through and out of the great vats of tanning liquor on huge reels moved by water and steam power. There are 20 residents of Chester ville over eighty years of age, and 1 over ninety. The town sent 65 men into the army of the Union during the war of the Rebellion, of which 23 were lost. When the region was first explored byr the settlers, they found at the rapids or falls at Chesterville Centre, on the Little Norridgwock, remains of palisades enclosing an area of some 3 acres where the village now stands.

The surface of the town is agreeably varied, without considerable"], [193, "CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 185 elevations or depressions. Mill Hills are the greatest elevations. The rock is granite, and the soil clay with sandy and clay subsoil. It is an excellent farming town, and its agricultural fairs are always cred itable. The principal collection of houses is at Cumberland Centre, which occupies an elevated site, and is a salubrious and pleasant vil lage. It is also a place of much mental culture, having a Congrega tional church, and an excellent academy called Greely Institute. The institute is supported by a permanent fund left by the benefactor for whom it was named ; and all youths in the town between the ages of twelve and twenty-one years are entitled to its instructions without cost. The institute has a good library, and it is also the place where many excellent lectures and other intellectual entertainments are afforded to the people. Cumberland is notable for the many dis tinguished persons, \u2014 ministers, missionaries, authors and teachers, who were born or have lived there. At the Foreside there are some fine residences, and many attractive homes. The Androscoggin and the Kennebec lines of the Maine Central Railroad form a junction near the station, a short distance from the Centre. The Grand Trunk Railway crosses the town near the sea, having a station at Poland Corners. The manufactories consist of a carriage-factory at the Centre, a grist-mill and two saw and stave mills at West Cumberland, etc. A large, old-fashioned wooden-build ing constitutes a town-hall, convenient for many purposes. The pub lic and private property is generally in good repair, and the town has a thrifty look to the traveler. Along many of the public roads are shade-trees \u2014 maole and elm \u2014 from ten to one hundred years old. Cumberland was formerly a part of North Yarmouth, and the history of that town embraces the chief part of the history of Cumberland, also. It was set off and incorporated in 1821. Besides the churches already mentioned, the town has a Univer salist church and two Methodist churches. Cumberland has nine pub lic schoolhouses, valued at $28,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $511,920. In 1880 it was $556,460. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 15 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,626. In the census of 1880 it was 1,619. Cumberland COUllty is situated in the south-western part of the State, and on the north-east of York County. Oxford County bounds it on the west ; Oxford, Androscoggin, Sagadahoc, on the north ; and on the east lies the sea. Enclosed between the promon tory of Cape Elizabeth and Cape Small Point, just west of the mouth of the Kennebec, is Casco Bay, \"the fairest dimple on Ocean's cheek.\" It is one of the finest bays in the world, for its size, the number of its havens, and the unchangeable nature of its shores, islands and bottom. The line between the two points mentioned, which mark its outer limit, is about 25 miles ; while the distance from this line to the inner shore of the bay is about 15 miles. The name \" Casco,\" is derived from the Indian word, Aucocisco ; which, according to some authori ties signifies a resting-place, while others give it the interpretation of crane or heron. This bay is more thickly studded with islands than any other body of water in the United States. They are of the most picturesque forms ; and about them bold headlands aud peninsulas jut far out into the quiet waters of the bay."], [194, "186 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. It is a popular compliment to the days of the year to say that Casco Bay has 365 islands. There are really 122 islands and islets, \u2014 not cotinting the rocks and reefs which might be made to swell the num ber possibly to 150. A few of these still bear their aboriginal names, as Chebeague and Jebaskadiggin. The most beautiful island in the bay has long borne the name of Hog Island ; but Diamond Cove \u2014 \" a jewel in a swine's snout \" \u2014 is beginning to give its name to the island in which it is contained.

The bay is also as remarkable for its peninsulas as for its many islands. Between the sheltered waters of Fore River and Back Cove, at its western extremity, extends Casco Neck, covered by the city of Portland. At the eastern end, the long, narrow peninsula of Harp swell stretches out some eight miles into the quiet waters, flanked by many islands. At this end the islands cluster thickest, and the main land reaches out many fingers, between which creeks and inlets and tidal rivers extend far inland ; and the shore is fringed with pictu resque \" Points.\" The principal river is the Presumpscot, which, in the 22 miles of its length, furnishes water-power to the amount of 20,846 horse-power, with a flow of unusual uniformity. Connected with this river are twenty-three distinct lakes, with an agregate area of more than 90 square miles. Several of these, of which the chief are Lake Sebago and Long Pond, are valuable for commercial navigation. This lake and pond are connected by a canal with Portland Harbor at Fore River. Sebago Lake is a noble reservoir of the purest water in New England. The name is said to signify \" a stretch of water.\" It is dis tant from Portland 17 miles by the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad. The lake is 14 miles long by 11 miles wide, and contains an area of 50 square miles. Its depth in some parts is 400 feet. Six towns form its shores, and others are located on the connected lakes at the north. Dining the summer fine steamers daily leave Pavilion Bay, near Lake Sebago Station, for Harrison Village, at the north-eastern extrmity of Long Pond. Reaching the broader part of the lake, Rattlesneake Mountain, in Raymond, conies into view ; and in the same direction, but near the lake, may be seen the boyhood home of Nathaniel Hawthorne"], [195, "CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 187 On the route are the fourteen Dlngley Islands. On the west, the scenery is more rugged. Saddleback Mountain, in Baldwin, is plainly visible, from which the eye roams north-east beyond the Great Bay, over the hills, forests and \"farms of the town of Sebago. Still farther north is Peaked Mountain, beyond which the view extends north to Mount Kiarsarge (or Pequaket), standing blue and cold in the hazy distance ; while, if the day is tolerably clear, the White Mountains may be distinctly seen. The direct passage of the lake by steamer re quires one hour, when the rapid and devious Songo River is reached. It is but two and a half miles direct to the head of the river ; but following its course the boat must sail six miles and make twenty-seven IiAKE SEBARO, turns, and pass a lock at the junction of Crooked, or Pequaket River From the river, the boat enters the Bay of Naples, with Naples Village at its head ; thence passes out upon Long Pond, on the western side of which lies Bridgton, while Harrison forms the eastern shore. Cumberland County has no high mountains. Its rocks, from Cum berland to Saco, are varieties of argillaceous slate, with or without cleavage, and mica schist and talcose slate with magnesia. Eastward and northward of this, the two last, with granite and trap, are the pre vailing rocks. The first settlement in the county was at Brunswick, in 1628, or earlier by Thomas Purchas.

The village is on the stage line from Thomaston to Friendship. It is 10 miles from the railroad station at Rockland. The plantation name for St. George and Cushing was St. George ; and, in like manner, at first incorporation in 17897 both became the town of Cushing. The name was given in honor of Thomas Cushing, lieutenantrgovernor of Massachusetts. Both formed a part of the Waldo"], [197, "CYR PLANTATION. 189 Patent, and were settled by Scotch emigrants from the north of Ireland, brought over in 1733 under the auspices of General Waldo. In the year 1753 a very strong stone fortress was built in this town, which was garrisoned by a company of provincial troops under the command of Major Burton.

It has three harbors, Holmes's Bay on the west, Little Ma chias Bay on the south, and Cutler Harbor on the south-east. The last is one of the best harbors on the Atlantic coast, being deep, free from ice, and protected by high land on each side, and by an island at the mouth bearing a lighthouse. The points are Sprague's, Neck, on the west, Quaker Head and Cape Wash on the south, and Little River Head and Sandy Point further east. The surface of the town is much broken by hills and ledges, be tween which, however, are valuable meadows, producing an excellent quality of grass. The principal stream is Schooner Brook. The scenerv of the town is said to be delightful. From an elevated point on the east side of Cutler Harbor called the \" Lookout \" a fine view is gained in clear weather of the Bay of Fundy, with its numerous sails. The manufactures of this town are shingles and herring-boxes. A considerable business is done in the fisheries, and a few vessels have been built here. The original settlers of this town were Ephraim Andrews, John Davis Robert Cates and John Maker. They came from Machias about 1785, and engaged in farming and fishing. In 1813, during the war with Great Britain, an American cutter lying in the harbor was cap tured by the crew of an armed vessel of the enemy. Some of the in habitants also were plundered, but not without resistance. The plan tation at this time contained about 30 families. The title of the settlers were obtained from John C. Jones, and after his death from Joseph Cutler, of Newburyport. The town was incorporated in 1826, and named in honor of Mr. Cutler. The Methodist denomination have a church and sustain worship here.

Potash is a large in gredient of the soil, which needs a deal of stirring to render it avail able for plant food. Potatoes, oats and corn are the principal crops. Fitz's Pond, having an area of three square miles, is well stocked with black bass. Hat-Case Pond is notable for a fine display of bowl ders near ij. On the outlets of the ponds are some fine water-powers. The manufactures consist of one grist-mill, a carding-inill, saw-mill, shingle-mill, and a large tannery. Dedham, named for a Massachusetts town, was originally a part of Township Number 8, and was incorporated under its present name in 1837. The Colony settlement was for years known as New Bos ton, and the inhabitants were accused of \" putting on airs.\" The Congregationalists have a church-edifice, and sustain worship. Dedham has five schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $1,000. The town valuation in 1870 was $102,752. In 1880 it was $98,308. The rate of taxation in the latter year, 21 mills on the dollar. 'The population in 1870, was 448. In the census of 1880 it was 406. Deerillg', one of the southern towns of Cumberland County, joins Portland in the western half of both, while their eastern parts are separated by the waters of Back Cove. Westbrook, from which it was taken, bounds it on the north-west, Falmouth on the north-east, the -waters of Casco Bay on the south-east, and Back Cove, Portland and Cape Elizabeth, on the south. The Presuinpscot River forms the boundary line between the eastern halves of Deering and Westbrook. Fore River penetrates it in the western part, where it is also crossed by Stroudwater River and the Oxford and Cumberland Canal. The surface of the town is not greatly varied. Rocky Hill and Mitchell's Hill are the principal elevations. Granite and argillaceous rock underlie. The soil is generally clayey. The principal business centre isMorrill's Corner, or Steven's Plains. Woodford's Corner, the next in extent, and nearer Portland, is largely a place of residence for persons doing business in the city. It is a pretty village with a handsome church and several fine residences. East Deering, connected with Portland by Tukey's Bridge and the Grand Trunk Railway, has shipbuilding for its principal business. The village is young and prosperous, and has provided itself with a neat hall for home entertainment. Beyond it is the United States Marine Hospital, situated on Martin's Point, where a bridge extends to Fal mouth Foreside. Beautiful Evergreen Cemetery, the principal bury ing-place of Portland, lies a little westward of Morrill's Corner. For est City Trotting Park, and the adjoining grounds used for State Fairs, are on the eastern bank of Fore River. The Portland and Rochester Railway crosses the grounds, and the Cumberland and Oxford Canal terminates near by. West of these, and on the opposite side of the river, is Stroudwater village. It now has a factory for"], [203, "DEERING. 195 canned foods, and a grain and salt mill producing about 80,000 bushels of meal and 40,000 boxes of ground salt annually. The first church was organized herein 1765, and Thomas Brown was ordained as pastor. Stroudwater was a flourishing village in the period when shipbuilding and the coasting trade were prosperous. There is another canning factory at Bride's Bridge (Riverton), on the Presumpscot River. At Morrill's Corner are tanneries, manufactories of brittania ware, boots and shoes, marble and granite monuments, etc. Near Deering's Bridge are the pottery, tile, and fire-brick works of the Portland Stoneware Co., occupying nearly four acres of ground. They have some of the largest kilns in the country, and turn out monthly about 30,000 fire bricks and $2,000 worth of stone ware. About 70 men are employed. Other industries of the town are tree and plant nurseries, brick-making, pork-packing, boat-building, carriage and harness making, etc. Richard Tucker and George Cleeves were the first local proprietors of land within the limits of Deering, having purchased of Sir Ferdin ando Gorges, about 1637, 1,500 acres on Back Cove, between Fore River and the Presumpscot, In 1640 there were four families residing at Back Cove. King Philip's, or the first Indian war, broke out in 1675, but his vicinity was not attacked until August of the following year when an Indian known as \" Simon, the Yankee-killer,\" a fugitive from Philip's de feated forces, made himself familiar at the house of Anthony Brackett, the principal settler at Back Cove. A few days later one of his cows was missing, and the fact being mentioned before Simon, he said, \" I can show you the Indians who killed the creature.\" He departed ; but a few days later he returned accompanied by a band of savages. \" Here are the Indians who took your cow,\" said he. They killed Mr. Brackett and three of his neighbors, and carried their wives and children away captive, except that one woman with her children escaped in a canoe. Again in 1689, Brackett's farm was the scene of a fierce contest between a large body of French and Indians and the forces under the noted Major Church, by whose victory the neighboring vil lage of Casco Neck was saved. The Deering mansion and farm, just north and west of the Deering Bridge, now occupy the locality of the fight. Futher incidents of its history can be found in the accounts of the towns of Falmouth and Westbrook, from which it was set off and incorporated in 1871. \" The village of Steven's Plains,\" says Elwell, \" with its broad level streets, and side-walks shaded with umbrageous maples and elms, has a quiet and rural beauty. Its chief ornament is the Universalist Church, a very tasteful structure, built in 1867, at a cost of about $14,000. The church stands at the entrance of the grounds of the Westbrook Seminary. This institution, incorporated in 1831, was the first seminary of learning established in New England under the pat ronage of the Universalist denomination. The seminary building was erected in 1834, at a cost of $7,000.\" Goddard Hall and Hersey Hall, both large edifices of brick, were built, the first in 1859, the last in 1869. The institution has two courses in the collegiate department, and confers the degree of Laureate of Arts upjn all young ladies who successfully pass examination in a classical course, and Laureate of Science in the scientific course. In the academic department diplomas are granted in two courses, English and College Preparatory. Back Cove, Pride's Bridge, an elegant span of iron, Cumberland"], [204, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 196 Mills, and other points afford views worthy the attention of visitors. The scene of an extensive land-slide into the Presumpscot, which forced the river from its bed, possesses interest to the geologist. Besides the Universalist church just mentioned, there are in town two Congregational churches and one Methodist. The educational facilities in Deering are excellent. The schools are graded from pri mary to high. It has twelve public schoolhouses, and its school property is valued at $40,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $2,194,096. In 1880 it was $2,585,825. The rate of taxation in 1880 was $1.85 on $100. Ttu population in 1870 was 3,795. By the census of 1880 it was 4,324. Deer Isle, in Hancock County, is a group of three islands lying between the northern part of Isle au Haute Bay and Brooklin and Sedgewick on the mainland. It is 35 miles south-south-west of Ellsworth. The town includes Little Deer Isle, Great Deer Isle, and Eafle Isle. The first mentioned and most northerly of the group has an area of 1,000 acres, which is well suited to agriculture. Great Deer Isle is about 10 miles in length, from north to south, and near 5 miles in width. The surface in the northern part is rather level, while in the south it is rough. Micaceous limestone was undoubtedly the parent rock of Deer Isle, but it has been crystalized, and is thus rendered unfit for quicklime, though suitable for architectural sculpture. At the \" Reach \" is a quarry which is operated for this marble, affording a yearly product of 4,000 tons of rough and cut stone; while roofing slate of a good quality has been found on Little Deer Isle. At this place, it is stated, are found conclusive evidences of an extinct volcano, which in some of the by-gone years, belched forth its showers of ashes, and poured out its molten lava. As will be apparent, the transition series of rocks is well characterized in these islands. Large deposits of silver, also, have recently been found, and two companies now hold property on the island for the purpose of mining this mineral. The soil is loamy, and the largest crop is potatoes. The forest trees are principally spruce and fir. Along the roadsides in the most thickly settled parts of the town, are many shade trees from five to forty years old, of various kinds, but mostly chestnut. Adam's Hill, is the principal eminence, reaching a height of 256 feet above the sea. Torry's and Marshall's are the only considerable ponds, one being a mile long, the other two miles. Smith's mineral spring has a local celeb rity. The manufactures consist of sails, wrought granite; while at Oceanville and at Green's Landing, are establishments for the packing of the various kinds of fish. Deer Isle was incorporated in 1789, being the fourth town in the county. The first known visit of Europeans was that of Weymouth in 1605. It early received its name from the abundance of deer in its forests. The first settlement was commenced by William Eaton near what is now known as the \" Scott Farm,\" in 1762. The first church was built in 1773, and the first preacher was Rev. Mr. Noble; the first pastor was Rev. Peter Powers. In 1809, Rev. Joseph Brown, a dis senter, was installed. The first white child was Timothy Billings, born Maj', 1764. The privations of the settlers during the war of the Revolution were terrible. The number of Deer Islanders in the service of the Union during"], [205, "DENMARK. 197 the war of the Rebellion was, soldiers and sailors, 386, and of these 55 were lost. The amount of bounty paid by the town was $59,128. The climate is quite salubrious, as is apparent from the number of old people, there being 10 between eighty and one hundred years of age. As a summer resort, it is highly esteemed by its visitors, having good hotels, ample boating and fishing facilities, as well as drives. The roads are good, and the buildings are generally in good repair, and a look of thrift prevails. There is a nice town-hall, three stories in height. There are in town two Congregational church-edifices, two Methodist and two Baptist. Deer Isle has three high-schools, and its public schoolhouses number twenty. The school property is valued at $8,810. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $417,211. In 1880 it was $373,182. The rate of taxation in 1880 was two per cent. The population in 1790 was 682 ; in 1870, 3,414 ; in 1880, 3,267. Denmark lies on the eastern border of the southern part of Oxford County. Fryeburg bounds it on the north-west, Brownfield on the south-west, Hiram on the south, and Bridgton and Sebago, in Cumberland County, on the north and east. The town is about 8 miles long from north to south, and 6 miles from east to west. Moose Pond, the head of which lies in the northern part of Fryeburg, extends south-westerly to the centre of Denmark, being 7 miles in length, and Little Moose Pond and Moose Stream continue in the same course to the sou h-west side of the town, where it discharges into Saco River, which there forms the boundary line. At the foot of Moose Pond, in the centre of the town, is Denmark Village (Denmark Post Office). This place is about 30 miles south-west of Paris, and 40 from Portland. It is on the Brownfield and Bridgton stage-line. The Brownfield station of the Portland and Ogdensbuig Railroad is on the opposite bank of the Saco River, on the south-eastern side of the town, whence a stage runs to Denmark Village. South of the village is Granger Pond ; Great Hancock Pond lies on the south-eastern line, and toward the village, Litt,e Hancock Pond. Beaver Pond lies one and a half miles north of the village, and Pleasant Pond on the north-eastern line. Between the two is Long Pond, with the remarkable Cold Spring just south-east of it, near the road to West Denmark. Between Denmark Village and the western line of the town are two peaks called Baston Hills. In the north-eastern part of the town is a group of eight moun tains some ten miles in circumference, whose highest peak is known as Pleasant Mountain. Its summit is stated to be 2,000 feet above the sea. The view of ponds, streams, mountains, valleys, and forests from its summit is grandly beautiful. A good hotel near the top affon's entertainment. The surface of the town is generally hilly, and very stony. Granite is the principal rock, and the soil is sandy. Potatoes, corn and oats are the crops chiefly cultivated, and yield fairly. The outlets of Moose Pond and other streams furnish excellent water-powers. In the town are one mill for long lumber, six stave-mills, a sash, blind and door factory, and two grain-mills, several of which are at the centre village. Fryeburg was formed from a grant made by Massachusetts to Fryeburg Academy, and two other grants to individuals, together with a strip from the town of Brownfield. The first settlements were made in 1788-9. Among the original settlers were Ezra Stiles, David Porter,"], [206, "198 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Nathaniel Symonds, Thomas Bragdon, Nathaniel Mclntire, Ephraim Jewett, William Davis, Parson and Thomas Pingree, Elias Berry and Cyrus Ingalls, several of whom came from Andover, Mass. The early name for this region was Pequaket, from the native tribe which dwelt here. The town was incorporated, February 20, 1807. A post-office was first established here in 1819 ; and this year Elias Berry was the representative in the General Court. Among later valued citizens were Leonard Berry, Dr. Sawyer, and others. There are Methodist, Free Baptist, Congregational and Universalist churches at various points in the town, most of which sustain a minister through the year. Denmark has seven public schoolhouses, valued with other school property at $5,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $280,316. In 1880 it was $305,185. The rate of taxation in the latter year was one and a quarter cents on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,069. In 1880 it was 904. DenilicetO Wll Plantation, a district of Moose River Planta tion, Somerset County. DeilliySVille lies in the south-eastern part of Washington County, about 17 miles west of Eastport. It is bounded on the north by Charlotte, on the east by Pembroke, and south and west by Ed munds and an unnamed township. Denny's River forms the boundary line on the west. Wilson's stream runs southward through the eastern part of the town. The principal power is a tide-power on Denny's River, at the village in the southern part of the town. Here are mills for manufacturing long lumber and staves, and a grist-mill. The prin cipal other business is ship-building. The town is the terminus of the stage-line to Calais. The surface of the town is broken and hilly. The most prevalent rock is locally known as iron-stone. The soil is divided between loam, clay and gravel. Potatoes, hay and grain are the crops chiefly culti vated. Spruce, pine and hemlock form the bulk of the forests. The most notable eminences are Page's Hill and King David's ledge. The original settlers of Dennysville arrived in the river on the 17th of May, 1786, in the sloop \" Sally.\" They were from the vicinity of Hingham, Mass. In this company were Nathan Preston, William Kilby and Samuel Sprague, who remained and formed the nucleus of the present town. The first chuchr organization was Congregational, and was formed by Rev. Jotham Sewell, on October 27, 1805. This denomination now has the only church in the town. The first Sunday school was organized May 31, 1829. Deacon William Kilby was superintendent ; Benjamin R. Jones, secretary and librarian ; and John Kilby, treasurer. The teachers were Benjamin Foster, John Kilby, Solomon Foster, Isaac Eastman, John Mayhew, Eben Mayhew, Sally Lincoln, Caroline L. Jones, Amelia H. Jones, Mary Wilder, Lydia Kilby, Hannah Wilder and Eliza Eastman. The proprietors of this township (which for many years included also that of Pembroke and Perry) were Thomas Russell, General Ben jamin Lincoln and John Lowell, of Massachusetts, who purchased it from the commonwealth ; and the present titles came from them. The town was incorporated in 1818, taking its name from the river that formed its western boundary, \u2014 Denny's River ; and the river had its"], [207, "DEXTER. 199 name from an Indian of that name who, at the period of settlement made it his principal hunting-ground. Dennysville has two public schoolhouses, valued with other school property at $4,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $199 319 In 1880 it was $184,786. The rate of taxation in the latter year' was 18 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 488. In 1880 it was 522. Detroit forms the south-eastern corner of Somerset County and lies 24 miles east of Skowhegan. Palmyra is on the north ; Pitts field on the west; Plymouth, in Penobscot County, on the east ; and Troy, in Waldo County, on the south. The Maine Central Railroad passes through the northern part of the town. The northern branch of the Sebasticook River runs centrally through the town, furnishing its chief water-power. At the \"Rips\" near the village in the north-east ern part of the town, there is a fall of 30 to 40 feet in one-fourth of a mile. The power is estimated to be equal to sawing 10,000,000 feet of lumber annually. The manufactories here are a lumber and shingle mill, a grist-mill, carriage factory, turning and jig-sawing. Granite and limestone, suitable for building, are found in the town. Farming is the principal occupation, and is found profitable. This town was incorporated in 1838, under the name of Chandler ville, but changed in 1841 to the present name. The most active church organization in town is that of the Methodists. Detroit has two pub lic schoolhouses, and other school property to the value of $1,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $141,731. In 1880 it was $117,019. The population in 1870 was 690.

It is 41 miles from Bangor, 42 miles from Waterville (junction), and 123 miles from Portland by railroad. Garland bounds it on the east, Corinna on the south, San- gerville, in Piscataquis County, on the north, and Ripley, in Somerset County on the west. The form of the town is square, and it has an area of 20,370 acres, 1,200 of which are covered with water. Bryant's Hill is the loftiest eminence. The town is on the summit of land be- tween the Kennebec and Penobscot Rivers. The surface is beautifully varied with vales, hills and ponds. Of the latter, Dexter Pond is the largest, extending from the western border to past the centre of the town. The streams that furnish power are the outlet of Dexter and Spooner's ponds, Kenduskeag River, in the south-eastern part of the town, and Sebasticook Main Stream, which winds along westward through the entire northern border of the town. At the north-west corner, upon Main Stream, are lumber and shingle mills, a brick-yard, etc.; and on the outlet of Spooner's Pond in the southern part of the town, are one or more mills. In all, Dexter has 28 powers, 26 of which have an aggregate fall of 331 feet. The fall on Dexter Pond Stream alone in the first three-fourths of a mile is 142 feet, and in 2 miles 160^- feet, These bear the name of Dexter Falls, and contain 16 different distinct falls, upon each of which is some machinery. The pond which forms the reservoir contains about 1,000 acres, and is a"], [208, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 200 beautiful sheet of water. It is fed very largely by springs, and is there fore little affected by drought or freshet. There are on the water-power in this town, about twenty-five different mills and factories, chiefly situated at Dexter Village. The principal manufactures are boots and shoes, long lumber, boxes, doors, sashes and blinds, churns, carriages, woolen cloths, mens' clothing, cooper's ware, flour, meal and feed, iron castings, stoves, plows, soap, leather, marble-work, tinware, etc. Dex ter Village is the present terminus of the Dexter and Newport Rail road. It is beautifully situated on a hillside with easy slopes toward the pond and stream. It contains two or more good schoolhouses, several handsome churches, one of the best town-halls in the State, and has a public library of about 1,600 volumes. The Barron Memorial Church (built in memory of the cashier of the Dexter Bank, murdered by burglars while defending his charge), is located in this village, and is an elegant edifice. The streets of the village are of ample width, and are generally shaded by rows of elms and maples, having, for the most part, a growth of forty years. There is an unusual number of tasteful residences in the village and town; all buildings \u2014 public and private \u2014 being in excellent repair, impressing the traveler with the pre valence of thrift. The roads are excellent. The principal bridge has a length of 30 rods, and is constructed of stone. The prevalent rocks in the town are slate, an impure limestone, and a quartzose rock. Maple, birch and beech are the chief trees in the woods. The soil is quite fertile, yielding well of all the usual farm crops. Dexter, among much that is beautiful and interesting, has a natural curiosity in Swan ton's Cave ; which, however, is mostly filled with water. The township which is now Dexter, was surveyed in 1772, but re mained unsettled until the arrival of David Smith, in 1801. The first family resident in the town was that of Ebenezer Small, of Gilmanton, N. H. He was followed, soon after, by a large delegation from the same region, \u2014 among whom were Joseph Tucker, Seba French, Wil liam Mitchell, Simeon and John Safford, and the Shepleys, Smiths and Maxwells. The plantation was at first called Elkinstown. In 1803 the boundaries of the township were established, and it was divided into lots for settlers, \u2014 the plan being drawn by Simeon Safford. In 1804 the township was granted to Amos Bond and eight others. The town was incorporated in 1816; receiving its name in honor of Hon. Samuel Dexter, who was that year the democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts \u2014 Mr. Brooks, the Whig candidate obtain ing the election. The post-office was established in 1818, the mail being carried between Bangor and Skowhegan once a week on horse back. Daniel Hayden was the carrier. The Universalists erected the first meeting-house in 1829. In 1848 a violent tornado passed over the town, tearing up the largest trees and crushing some of the strongest buildings. The First National Bank of Dexter has a capital of $100,000. The Dexter Savings Bank, at the beginning of 1880, held in deposits and profits, the sum of $146,196.78. The \" Dexter Gazette,\" published by M. F. Herring, Esq., is a wide awake paper, serving well the interests of the town. The Baptist, Free Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, Univer salist, Episcopal, Roman Catholic and Advent, have organizations and churches in Dexter. Public entertainments are chiefly literary and"], [209, "DIXFIELD. 201 dramatic in their nature. The village has an excellent high-school.

Diri^O, a post-office in China, Kennebec County, Dixfield is situated on the north side of the Androscoggin River, between this and the north-eastern border of Oxford County. The length of the town, east and west, is about 1\\ miles, and north and south, 5 miles. The surface is uneven, especially north-west of the centre, where three large hills stand in a line, of which the south- western one, consisting of two peaks known as the \" Sugar Loaves,\" is the highest. Near the Androscoggin, a little west of the middle of the town, is a high hill called \u2022' The Bluff.\" In the south-eastern part of the town is a group of three mountains in a triangular position, of which the highest are Burnt Mountain and Aunt HepSey Brown's Mountain. Webb's River forms the boundary line between this town and Mexico, on the west; Newton Brook comes down from the north across the middle of the town to the Androscoggin, and Seven Mile Brook crosses the north-eastern corner. Each of these streams has one or more powers, \u2014 the town having a total of seven. Newton Brook has three powers, two of which are occupied by saw-mills. On Seven Mile Brook, at East Dixfield, are two powers, upon which are a saw- mill, a mill for long and short lumber, and a grist-mill. The principal power is at Dixfield Village, on Webb's River, at the south-west cor- ner of the town. On this power there are a saw-mill, a box-factory and a grist-mill. There is also a steam saw-mill at the village. East Dixfield, and Dixfield Centre each have a cheese-factory. Other man- ufactures in the town are carriages, tooth-picks and cigar-lighters, flies and leaders, boots and shoes, marble work, etc. This township was granted by Massachusetts to Jonathan Holman and others. Ezra Newton with his wife and sister, spent the winter of 1793 here. They are supposed to be the first white persons who made their habitation in the town ; but they left on the return of spring John Marble came in during the same season with a yoke of oxen ; but no permanent settlement was made until 1795, when Mar- ble, with Gardner Brown, Amos Trask, Levi Newton, David Torrey and John Gould came, accompanied by their families. At this time the township had become the property of Dr. Elijah Dix, of Boston; and for him at its incorporation, June 21, 1803, the town was named. Dixfield Village is beautifully situated and built. It is 18 miles from the railroad station at Bryant's Pond, and 13 miles from the North Jay station. The stage-line between the two places runs through Dixfield, by way of the village. Each of the three villages mentioned has a post-office. The denominations which have churches here are"], [210, "202 GAZETTEER OF MjUNE. the Congregationalists, Universalists and Free Baptists.

The nearest railroad stations are at Newport on the north, and Brooks at the south, each about 9 miles distant. Plymouth and Etna bound it on the north, Newburgh on the east, and on the south and west are Jackson and Troy. The town is square in form, and contains 23,040 acres. The surface is uneven and broken, and there are many gray bowlders scattered over the surface. Mount Harris and Peaked Moun tain are the principal eminences. The soil is a yellow loam, excellent for hay ; of which large crops are raised. The forest trees are chiefly beech, birch, maple and hemlock. Skinner Pond, in the northern part of the town, has an area of 300 acres ; another at the Centre has 200 acres ; and two others have an area of 75 and 100 acres respectively. The powers on the outlets of these ponds are occupied by two mills for long lumber, two for shingles, and one grist-mill. Dixmont has four small villages, Dixmont Centre, East, North, and North-East Dixmont. The township, in the original survey, was known as No. 3, Range 1 north of the Waldo Patent. It was granted by Massachusetts to Bowdoin College, wherefore it was called Collegetown. John J. Blais dell, of Parsonsfield, purchased of the college 3,000 acres, at $1 per acre ; but he failed to make the payment at the stipulated time, and the purchase reverted to the college, from which the settlers on this tract obtained titles to their lands. The remaining 20,040 acres were purchased by Dr. Elijah Dix, of Boston, July 12, 1801, for the sum of $21,431 ; and from him and the mountain in the southerly part, the town takes its name. Dixmont was incorporated February 28, 1807. Friend Drake, Elihu Alden, John Bassford, Benjamin Brown, and nine others were the first permanent settlers. This town was the residence of Hon. Samuel Butman, representative in Congress from 1827 to 1833. There are two Free Baptist churches, one Baptist, one Christian, and one Methodist church in the town.

It is bounded by Foxcroft on the north, At kinson on the east, Sangerville on the west, and Garland, in Penobscot County, on the south. Withee Pond, two miles long by half a mile wide, is the principal body of water. The area of the town is about 22,444 acres. The surface is uneven, but not hilly. The prevailing rock is granite. Dover is one of the best townships of farming land in the county, having a large extent of interval, and few lots not under cultivation. Potatoes, corn and grain are cultivated with success."], [211, "DOVER. 203 The township was purchased of Massachusetts about the year 1800 by Hallowell and Lowell, of Boston, for Charles Vaughn and John Merrick, of Hallowell, from whom present titles are derived. Mr. Mer rick, in 1836, built a meeting-house on Bear Hill, and gave it with 20 acres of land to the Methodist society. He also gave the land which constitues the park at Dover village. Abel Blood was the pioneer in making clearings. Sometime before 1799 he purchased a tract of land a mile square ; and in the following June he came in yvith seven men. They were obliged to make the way from Norridgewock, a distance of fifty miles, on foot, excepting about fifteen miles at the start. Having made clearings they returned. The first permanent settler of Dover was Eli Towne, of Temple, New Hamp shire, who moved in with his family in 1803. Thomas Towne, who soon came te reside with his son Eli, had been a Revolutionary soldier, and was a mighty hunter ; and many are the stories told of his contests with moose, deer, bear and wolves. On one occasion he fired upon and wounded a bear that yvas swimming across the pond. As the animal approached the shore tfie dog swain out and attacked him. Bruin seized the dog and plunged his head under water ; upon which the veteran soldier and hunter rushed in, and seizing the bear's head, thrust it under water, crying out fiercely, \" Drown my dog, will you !\" The bear was soon overcome and the dog rescued. Paul Lambert came in with his sons in 1808, having purchased 500 acres of land. In 1810 Deacon James Rowe moved his family in. Other settlers of this early period were Lyl'ord and John Dow, Allen Dwelley, John Spalding, Peter Brawn, Jonas Longley, Mr. Fifield, and the Chamberlains. Zachariah Longley, the father of Jonas, had been a fifer in the Revolutionary army. Nathanial Chamberlain was famous for building \"ex-bridges,\" and was once called to Ohio to build one there. In 1811-12 Paul Lambert put up an excellent set of frame buildings, and in after years his seven sons settled around him. In 1812 the township was organized as Plantation No. 3 ; and in 1822 it was incorporated as a town under its present name. The war rant for the first town meeting was issued by Justice Joshua Carpenter to Abraham Moor ; and the meeting was held at the dwelling-house of Joseph Shepard. Eli Towne was chosen clerk, D. Lambert, E. S. Greeley and Eli Towne, selectmen. Colonel J. Carpenter and Eben S. Greeley built a saw-mill on the Moor priviledge about 1822. Thomas Davee, in 1821, put up a store and a potash-factory at Dover village. He soon after put up saw-mills on the falls below Brown's mills, but after the dam was carried away in 1830, they were taken down. A plot was made of the present village territory about 1823, and Charles Vaughn constructed a dam and canal in 1826, putting up a grist mill upon it which had three sets of stones, with a cleaner for wheat. The first miller was Mr. Sewall Coch ran, who for forty-four years honestly took toll of grain raised thirty miles around. He at length became owner, but finally doffed his miller's coat and sold to the heirs of Hon. S. P. Brown. A carding and clothing-mill was also erected by Mr. Vaughn on this canal in 1827 ; and in 1836 it was changed into a woolen-factory. In 1840 both mills were burned. The woolen mill was soon rebuilt, and S. P. Brown, who had before superintended the business became the owner. In 1867, just before Mr. Brown's death, he built a large brick mill, which is still"], [212, "204 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. in operation. It has six sets of machinery and employs seventy-five hands. A new flouring mill had also been built, and both are run by S. O. Brown & Company. Another flour-mill is owned by Ira Wash- burne. Other manufactures at the village are carriages, boots and shoes, harnesses, pumps, trunks, tin-ware, etc. At East Dover, on the Piscataquis, is a wood-pulp and pasteboard mill ; and on Black Stream, at Dover South Mills, is a lumber-mill. Dover village has its streets shaded with maples and elms from five to fifty years of age, and is one of the neatest and prettiest places in the State. It is connected with Foxcroft village, on the north side of the river, by a bridge 265 feet long, so that the two appear as one village. The Bangor and Pis- cataquis Railway is the chief transportation line. The \" Piscataquis Observer,\" published in Dover by Edes and Bar- rows, is the only paper in the county. It is independent in politics, and fulfils its office in an excellent manner. The Piscataquis Savings Bank, located at Dover, on November 3, 1879, reported deposits and profits amounting to $58,663.25. Among former esteemed citizens of Dover may be mentioned Thomas Davee, Calvin S. Douty, Mordecai Mitchell, S. P. Brown, John G. May, and Thomas S. Pullen. John H. Rice was three times elected to Congress while a citizen of Dover. A Baptist minister, Elder N. Robinson, was settled by the planta tion about 1820. In 1822, Elder William Frost, a Universalist preacher, was residing in town. The Methodists, Baptists, and Free Baptists now have church-edifices. Dover has sixteen schoolhouses, valued at $6,400. The valuation of estates in 1870 was 675,000 In 1880 it was $574,943. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 2 per cent. The popula tion in 1870 was 1,983. In 1880 it was 1,687 Dresden, is the most westerly town in Lincoln County. It is situated upon the Kennebec River, opposite Richmond, and is on the medial line between the northern and southern points of the county. Alna and Wiscasset lie on the east ; on the north is Pittston, in Ken nebec count)r; and on the south is Woolwich, Sagadahoc County. Opposite, in the Kennebec, is the town of Perkins (Swan Island). Eastern River passes longitudinally through the town in a south westerly direction. Gardiner's Pond, one mile in length, is the chief body of water. The surface of the country is not greatly varied. The principal rock is a coarse granite. The soil is a sandy loam and clay. Hay, potatoes, barley and wheat, are each cultivated to a considerable extent. The villages are Dresden Mills and West Dresden. The first is situated at the head of sloop navigation on Eastern River. The last is connected by a ferry with Richmond, the landing being near a station of the Maine Central Railroad. The streams which furnish water-power are the Goud and Gardiner streams ; and there were until within a few years saw and grist mills in operation upon both. The manufactures consist of hay-knives, boots and shoes, etc. Dresden was formerly a part of Pownalboro, which embraced the town of Alna, Wiscasset and Perkins. The territory of these towns, excepting the last, was purchased by Christopher Lawson of the Indians in 1649, and sold by him to Messrs. Clark and Lake. The"], [213, "DREW. 205 latter resided upon his purchase until he was killed by the Indians. It was afterward owned by Sir Biby Lake, Edward Hutchinson and others. In a 1754, a fort was erected on the shore opposite the upper end of Swan Island, receiving its name of Fort Shirley, in compliment to Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts. This fort was commanded by Major Samuel Goodwin until it was dismantled. Pownalboro (incor porated in 1760) was named in honor of Governor Pownal, who had succeeded Shirley. It was the shire town of Lincoln County for thirty four years. Its court-house is still standing, nearly opposite the upper end of Swan Island, and in view from the cars of the Maine Central Railroad, on the western side of the river. It was 44 by 45 feet in ground dimensions, and three stories in height, as now. The court room was 45 by 19\u00a3 feet, with two fire places in it. Three brothers, William, Charles, and Rowland Cushing, were among the early settlers in this part of the town, having taken up their residence here in 1760. They were for many years quite prominent in public affairs of the county and State. Dresden formed what was known as the west precinct of Pownalborough, the east being Alna, and the south Whcisset ; and these, in 1794, were incorporated as a town, taking its name from the German town from which some of the inhabitants had emigrated under the auspices of General Waldo. Major John Polereczky, a Frenchman, distinguished as a soldier in the American army under General Rochambean, coming to reside here, was for fifteen years the town clerk. During the Revolution the town was in a troubled state; the royalist side being sustained by Rev. Jacob Bailey, an Episcopal clergyman, supported here mostly by an English missionary society. He appears to have been a pious man and faithful pastor; yet the outrageous treatment he received from those favorable to revolution led him to forsake the country and take refuge in Nova Scotia. There is now an Episcopal and Methodist church in the town. Dresden has a library of some 200 volumes, the property of the Dres den Library Society. There are nine public schoolhouses valued, with other school property, at $4,00. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $316,717. In 1880 it was $326,665. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 16^ mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 990. In 1880 it was 1,032. Drew Plantation occupies the north-eastern corner of the eastern part of Penobscot County. It was formerly township No. 7 of range 4. It is bounded by Prentiss on the south, Washington County on the east, and Barker and Reed plantations, in Aroostook County, on the north. The Mattawamkeag River enters near the north-eastern corner, and forming a sharp angle at the centre of the township, leaves it on the western side. The township is square in form, and contains about 36 square miles. The highest hills are Beech Ridge and Potter Hill. The forests contain the usual variety of trees. The soil is good where not too sandy. It yields well of most of the usual crops. Mud Pond is the largest sheet of water, being about one mile long by half a mile wide. The plantation is 76 miles E.N.E., of Bangor, on the European and North American Railway. It has two public schoolhouses, valued, with other school property at $500. The valuation of estates in 1880 was $33,335. The rate of"], [214, "206 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. taxation was 23 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 85. In 1880 it was 137. Dl*y Mills, a post-office in Gray, Cumberland County. DllCk Pond, a post-office in Westbrook, Cumberland County. DuilStail'S Corner, a small village in Scarborough, Cumberland County. Durham is situated in the southern part of Androscoggin County, on the south side of Androscoggin River. It has Lisbon on the north, Topsham and Brunswick on the east, Pownal on the south, and Auburn and New Gloucester on the west. Its area is about 18,000 acres. The township was a part of the Pejepscot purchase, and was formerly called Royalsborough, for Colonel Royal, of Medford, Mass achusetts, who was a large proprietor. It was incorporated as the sixty-ninth town in 1789, under its present name ; having at that time a population of about 700. In 1870 its population was 1,350, and in 1880 it was 1,253. The valuation in 1870 was $482,861. In 1880 it was $422,724. There are now thirteen schoolhouses in town, and the school property is valued at $3,000. The first school-master in town was Martin Rourk (the surname since changed to Roak), who also held the office of town clerk from 1791 to 1807. He was a native of Ireland, but left that country when a bojr, serving in the Continental army during the Revolution. He is the ancestor of the persons of that name in Androscoggin County. The first settler of Durham was Captain Samuel Gerrish, and the location was the farm since occupied by A. True Osgood. Captain Gerrish came into town after the reduction of Quebec, probably about 1770. In 1775, he enlisted in the Continental army leaving his family in such solitude that often for three months at a time, they did not see any other person. Jud ah Chandler came into town and built a saw-mill near where the Runround Mill now stands; and in 1773 he had quite a clearing, built a house and got his mill at work. Most of the settlers came from Duxbury, Salisbury and Scituate, Massachusetts, and later from Scarborough, in Maine. Other Revolutionary soldiers in the town were Isaac Davis, Isaac Turner, Samuel Gerrish, John Vining, Eben Woodbury, John Mclntosh, and Elisha Lincoln. The earliest set tled minister was Rev. Jacob Derrick, who preached in the old Centre Meeting-house for nearly forty years. This was the first meeting-house erected in the town, having been begun in 1796 and completed in 1804. Members of the society of Friends moved into the southern portion of the town from Harpswell in 1775, and others soon after came from Falmouth. Their first meetings were held in the house of Joseph Estes, at South Durham, now known as the \"Old Hawkes House.\" A small one-storied meeting-house was built soon after, a two-story ad dition was made in 1800 ; and in 1828 the whole structure was burned. The present brick meeting-house was built soon after. There are also now a Congregational church at South-West Bend, a Free Baptist, one mile and a half eastward, and a Methodisthouse at West Durham. The first grist-mill in town was on the Newell Brook where it crosses"], [215, "EAGLE LAKE PLANTATION. 207 the upper Brunswick road, about one and a half miles from the Bend. It was owned by Mr. James Gerrish, who sold it to Henry Plummer. Mr. Plummer was a Freewill Baptist, and devoted most of his Sundays to preaching. Having the means, he built the church near his mill at his own expense. Later a grist-mill was built at the Run-round power. Previous to this a mill was built on Dyer's Brook near the Bend, by John Mayall, an Englishman, for the manufacture of woolen cloth. This was afterwards converted into a grist, shingle, clapboard, and stave mill. A steam engine was added a few years ago. In 1818, a corporation was formed and a bridge built across the river near the Bend, connecting Durham with Lisbon; but it was swept away by a spring freshet the sixth year after its erection. It was rebuilt, aud stood until the great ice freshet in February, 1828, swept it off ; since then a ferry-boat has furnished transportation in its place. In the war of 1812 several from the town enlisted in the army ; and besides these, the militia was called out to act as a coast-guard, and marched to Bath. The danger being over, they returned after being on duty from 14 to 25 days. By the report of the adjutant general, it appears the town had under the various calls 161 men in the army for the suppression of the Rebellion. The amount paid out for bounties duties during the war was $27,673. The surface of the town is somewhat undulating, from north-east to south-west, with a slope at the north toward the river. The soil is mostly well- adapted to farming. The extreme south and part of the northern portion is somewhat rocky ; the central portion sandy ; while in all parts of the town are rich meadows and loamy uplands well adapted for hay. In the eastern part is a large peat bog. Dyei* BrOOk, a post-office in Aroostook County. Dyer'S Corner, a locality in Turner, Androscoggin, County. Eafisle Lake Plantation, in Aroostook County, is 12 miles south of Fort Kent, and 36 miles N.N.W. of Ashland. Walla grass Plantation lies on the north between it and Fort Kent. The area is 33 square miles. The western part of Eagle Lake lies in the eastern part of the town; and the Wallagrass Lakes in the north western part Fish River runs for a short distance in the south-eastern part ; and the north branch of Birch River gathers its streams in the south-western part. The plantation has three saw-mills and one grist mill. The principal products are cedar shingles and buckwheat. The principal settlements are along the western side of Eagle Lake, extending southward. The first settlers were Lefroi Nadeau, a Canadian1 Frenchman, and Richard Woods, an Irishman, who com menced their residence here in 1840. It was organized in 1856; tak ing its name from the numerous white-headed eagles which frequented the place The pond also has its name from the same circumstance The plantation has two public schoolhouses. The valuation in 1880 was $11 020 The population in 1870 was 143. In 1880 it was 233."], [216, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 208 East BaSS Harbor, a port and small village in Tremont, Mount Desert Island. EastbrOOk is situated a little east of the middle of Hancock County. Waltham bounds it on the west, Franklin on the south, Township No. 16, on the east, and No. 21 on the north. Eastbrook is 6 miles square, and has therefore an area of 23,040 acres. It is 18 miles north-east of Ellsworth. The name of the town is derived from the Eastbrook branch of Union River. Molasses, Scammon's, Abram's and Webb's ponds are the principal bodies of water. They vary f'-om two to three miles in length and equally in yvidth. The town is notable for its peat deposits. The principal rock is granite. The soil yields a good crop of wheat chiefly. The plough frequently turns out a fossiliferous stone composed of small shells imbedded in sand or clayey slate. Bull Hill Mountain is the highest elevation of land. The first settlements were made in 1800, by Joseph Parsons, Rob ert Dyer, Samuel Bragdon and John E. Smith. The first mill, and also the first framed-house, were built by Joseph Parsons. Francis Usher Parsons was the first child. There are now in the town two saw-mills for lumber, a stave-mill and a shingle-mill. Eastbrook contributed 17 men to the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion, of whom 9 were lost. The soldier's monu ment is a square marble pillar. There is one church-edifice, occupied as a Union house. Eastbrook has four public schoolhouses, valued at $800. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $39,288. In 1880 it was $63,681. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 15 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was \u2014 including townships Nos. 9, 10 and 13, \u2014 187. In 1880 the same have a population of 289. East LivermOre is the most northerly town in Andros coggin County. The Androscoggin River separates it from Liver more on the west, Jay forms its northern boundary, Fayette lies on the east, and Leeds on the south. It contains about 12,000 acres. Its length from north to south is about three times as great as its width from east to west. Moose Hill at the north-east angle of the town, Jug Hill near the middle of the town, and Ford's Hill half way be tween the two former, are the principal elevations of land. Moose Hill Pond near the hill, and a group of small ponds east of Jug Hill are the principal bodies of water. It has one village, situated on the falls at the north-west corner of the town, and bearing the name of Livermore Falls. It is about 27 miles from Lewiston and 17 from farmington, with which places it is connected by a branch of the Maine Central Railroad. Other stations in town are Strickland's Ferry and East Livermore. The town was formerly a part of Liver more, which waa granted by the General Court of Massachusetts in 1771 to the heirs and assigns of certain persons for services rendered in the reduction of Port Royal. The portion east of the river consti tuted about one-fourth of the original grant, and was set off and in corporated under its present name in 1843. The first settler is said to have been a Mr. Cooledge, who made an opening in the woods, and built a house on the side of Moose Hill. He soon after sold the place to Philip Smith, who died upon it a few years since at the advanced"], [217, "EAST MACHIAS. 209 age of ninety years. The next clearing is said to have been made in the easterly part of the town about 1780, by a Mr. Gravy, and a third made about the same time on the east bank of the Androscoggin River, at what is now Strickland's Ferry. The first settler at what is now the village of Livermore Falls was probably Mr. Samuel Richardson. The grist and saw mills built at the falls in 1791, were the first in town. They were constructed under the direction of Elijah Liver more, an original proprietor, and one of the first settlers upon the west side of the river. There is here a natural fall of fourteen feet. There are on these falls at present, a grist-mill, three saw-mills, a factory for novelty wood-turning, a leather-board factory, and the Umbagog Paper Fibre Mills. In the village there are also various small manufactures without water-power. The Indian name of the locality is Rokomeko, signifying, it is said, \" great corn land.\" The town yields good crops and is excellent grazing-land. It has also been noted for its fine cattle. The town furnished for the war of the Rebellion 68 citizens and 9 others, a total of 77, at an expense to the town of $10,654. The town has one Baptist church, one Free Baptist, and two Methodist. There is a small circulating library at Livermore Falls; and lectures are occasionally given at the various churches. The town has seven schoolhouses, valued at $3,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $388,680. In 1880 it was $344,092. The population at the first date was 1,004. In 1880 it was 1,082. East MaclliaS lies about midway of the southern shore of Washington County. It is bounded on the east by Marion and Whit- ing, south by Machiasport, west by Marshfield, and north by an un- named township. Gardner's Lake lies on a portion of the eastern/. boundary, and Machias River forms the southern line. Hadley Lake \u2022 extends from south of the centre of the town Into the township on the north. Its outlet constitutes East Machias River, and furnishes four- excellent powers, all within two miles of tide-water. The descent from the pond to tide-water \u2014 a distance of three miles \u2014 -is 47 feet. Oni Chace's Stream, the outlet of Gardner's Lake, are two excellent powers,, occupied by two saw, two lath, and one shingle-mill. This pond covers 8j square miles, and would afford power equal to 840 horse, or sufficient to run 33,600 spindles. The power on the river from Had- ley's Lake to the tide might be made equal to 1,600 horse, or sufficient for 64,000 spindles. Gardner's Lake, though scarcely a mile above the tide, is 00 feet above sea-level, The number of saw-mills of all kinds in the town is nine, of which two are double, and one runs a gang of saws. Other manufactories are two grist-mills, a tannery, four ship yards, etc. The village is chiefly at the head of the tide in the south ern part of the town, but extends on both sides of this river and Chace's Stream to the bay. Jacksonville Village is situated one and a half miles north of East Machias po6tK)ffice. East Machias is 4 miles north-cast of Machias. It is on the stage-line from Cherryfleld to East port, and is the terminus of the stage-lines to Lubec, Cutler, andi Township No. 14. It was set off from Machias and incorporated Jan. 24, , 1826. Samuel Scott was the first settler, being followed in 1768 by Col. Benj. Foster, W. Foster, J. Seavy, D. Fogg, J. Mansur, and others.

James Lyon, a Presbyterian, was the first min ister. He commenced his labors in the place in 1771, and a church was organized in 1781. The first meeting-house built in the town is now used for a store. He remained here until his death in 1794. Washington Academy was established in 1823, and had for its first Principal, Solomon Adams. Among the natives of East Machias who received their academical training at this institution should be men tioned, Samuel Harris, D.D., of Yale College ; Prof. Roswell D. Hitch cock, Union Theological Seminary ; William C. Talbot, San Francisco, capitalist; Andrew J. Pope, of the same city, who died in January, 1879, leaving an estate valued at $3,000,000 ; Frederic Talbot, New LOWER FALLS, EAST MACHIAS, ME. York; Charles II. Talbot, Providence; P.

The first Temperance Society in the region was formed at East Machias in 1827, There are now in the town three organized churches, having suitable edifices; the denominations being Baptist, Congrega tionalist and Methodist. Washington Academy is still fairly pat ronized, and its scholarship is sustained. The number of public schoolhouses is eight ; these, with other public-school property, being valued at $6,000.

Easton is on the eastern line of Aroostook County. It is bounded on the north by Fort Fairfield, west by Presque Isle, south by Mars Hill, and east by New Brunswick. The area is 36 square miles. The River DeChute drains the eastern and south-eastern part, and the Presque Isle Stream the western part. On these streams are several water-powers, which are at present occupied by two saw-mills and a grist-mill. The surface of the town is elevated, but is without lofty hills. The soil is strong and yields well of the usual farm crops. Potatoes, which are largely raised, find a ready market at the starch factories. Easton is 37 miles north of Houlton, on the stage-route to Fort Fairfield. There is a railroad station in Fort Fairfield, the adjoining town on the north. The town was incorporated in 1864. Previously the settlement was called Fremont Plantation. In the town is a Baptist church and two Christian churches. The town has eight public schoolhouses. The total school property is valued at $2,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $69,^79. In 1880 it was $88,484. The population in 1870 was 522. In 1880 it was 835. EaStpOrt is a town and island in the south-easterly part of Washington County, in Passamaquoddy Bay. The nearest towns are Perry on the north-west, and Lubec on the south-west. Lnbec Bay and its passages separate it from the mainland on the west, and the waters of Passamaquoddy Bay divide it from Campo Bello and Deer islands, which belong to Great Britain. It is connected with Perry by means of a bridge 1,280 feet in length. The greatest length of the town is about 5 miles in a north-western and south-eastern direction ; the greatest width is about 2 miles. The form of the island is ex- tremely irregular, and furnishes several good havens. The village is situated on the south-easterly part of the island, on a spacious harbor never closed by ice. Catching and curing fish has been and is still the principal industry of the town. There are now thirteen sardine fac- tories in full operation in Eastport, employing about 800 hands. These factories run night and day during the season, and turn out about 5,000 cases per week. Some $8,000 per week are paid out weekly to the hands, \u2014 men, women and children. The fish-curing houses mark- ing the eastern shore of the town, but numerously clustered along the water's edge at the village, are a very noticeable feature from the harbor. Another feature is the fortified hill in the village, called Fort Sullivan. \" The Prince Regent's Redoubt \" is the highest eminence in the town, the summit being 183 feet above high-water mark. The view of the bay from this point is very beautiful. The rock is generally trap, and the soil is gravel, loam and clay. Hay and potatoes are the principal crops. There are three excellent tide-powers within the town. The manufactories, other than those engaged in the various preparations of fish, are a steam-mill of 75 horse-power, comprising a grain-mill capable of grinding 400 bushels per day, box and spool machinery, making 2,000 boxes, and using 2,500 feet of spool lumber, and carding machin ery capable of making into rolls 150 lbs. of wool per day. The village contains about oue hundred warehouses and stores. It is prettily laid"], [220, "212 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. out, and along the streets are many elm, maple, hackmatac, mountain ash and balm of gilead trees ; while everywhere front yards are filled with flowers. Eastport was incorporated February 24, 1798, and was named East port from being the most eastern port in the United States. At this date the town included Moose Island (Eastport), Dudley's (Allen's), Frederic (Rice's) Islands, and the territory of the present town of Lubec. The latter with the two last islands were set off in in 1811. The first settlers were fishermen from Newburyport, Mass., and Ports mouth, N. H., of whom James Cochrane was the first, coming from Newburyport in 1772. Previous to its incorporation, Eastport was known as Moose Island. The chief office of the Passamaquoddy United States Customs District has been located at Eastport almost ever since the incorporation of the town. During the embargo of 1809 a fortification named Fort Sullivan was built on the hill at the village. In 1814, Majoi Perley Putnam, of Salem, was placed in command in this region, having a force of 100 militia, 30 of whom were stationed at Robbinston. On the 5th of July, in this year, a small force of British secretly despatched from Halifax, was joined by a fleet from Bermuda, the whole consisting of the \"Ram illies,\" a 74 gun ship, the sloop-of-war \" Martin,\" the brigs \"Rover\" and \"Bream,\" bomb-ship \"Terror,\" and several transports, carrying upwards of 1,000 men, consisting of the 102d infantry and a battalion of artillery. The troops were commanded by Colonel Thomas Pilkington, the whole force being under the command of Commodore Sir Thomas Hardy. These arrived before Eastport on the 11th of July. The force was so strong that it'appeared worse than useless to contend, and the place was surrendered. The British claimed the island as being on the British side of the boundary-line settled upon in 1783, and ordered the inhabitants to take the oath of allegiance. While some complied with the requirement others evaded it, and many removed to points west ward. Among the spoil found by the enemy was $9,000 in unfinished United States Treasury notes, lacking only the signature of the col lector of customs to render them valid ; but threats and artifices failed to induce the officer to sign them. After some time, having appointed a British collector of customs, the fleet departed, but left 800 troops to hold the place. These were continued here for three years afterthe war closed, on the plea that this island was included in the original limits of New Brunswick. The town in 1820, two years after the British force removed, con tained one hundred and twenty-five dwelling-houses, seventy-five stores, sixty wharves, and three meeting-houses, one of which cost $10,500. In 1839 the larger part of the business quarter of the village was burnt, but was soon rebuilt. Eastport furnished 403 men to the Union cause during the war of the Rebellion. There are now in the village a national and a savings-bank, the custom house for the Passa maquoddy district, a telegraph office, a United States signal station, a newspaper, and a public library of 1,800 volumes. The Frontier National Bank has a capital of $75,000 ; the Eastport Savings Bank, at the beginning of 1880, held in deposits and profits the sum of $153,780.34. The\" Eastport Sentinel.\" published by N. B. Nutt, Esq., is a valuable and interesting paper. Here is a port of the International Steamship Line, connecting with Boston, Portland and"], [221, "ED DING TON. 213 St. John ; and of the St. Croix Steamboat Line, by which it is con nected with Calais, St. Andrew's and Robbinston. It is the terminus of the daily stage-line to Calais and Machias, from the first of which it is distant 30, and from the last, 40 miles. Among the honored citizens of this town were lions. Lorenzo Sabine, Joseph C. Noyes, and Esquires Ichabod R. Chadbourne, Daniel T. Granger, Frederick Hobbs, Aaron Hayden, Bion Bradbury and Jonathan D. Weston. There are resident in the town ten persons above ninety years of age, fifteen about eighty, and one who claims to be one hundred and two. The churches of Eastport number seven, and are Congregational, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal, Unitarian, Christian and Roman Catholic. The Boynton high-school is located in this village. The number of public schoolhouses in the town is seven, valued, with appurtenances, at $12,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $901,686. In 1880 it was $882,892. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 3 per cent. The population in 1870 was 3,736. In 1880 it was 4,006. EatOll is situated in the north-eastern part of Washington County, 57 miles north-west of Calais. The township was formerly No. 9 of Range 4. It was incorporated in 1873. It is bounded east by Grand Lake, at the head of St. Croix River, south by Jackson Brook, and west by Danforth. The surface of the town is moderately uneven. The rock is generally granitic in character, and the soil gravelly. Hay is the principal crop. Hemlock constitutes the bulk of the forests. Grand Lake Cove, about 4 miles in length, lies in the eastern side of the town. Two or three other small ponds afford some water-power on their outlets. The Shaw Brothers tannery, located in this town, uses 8,000 cords of bark, and tans 600 tons of leather annually. The nearest railroad connection is at Forest Station, on the European and North American Railway, 8 miles distant. This township furnished 16 men to the Union forces during the war of the Rebellion, of whom 6 were lost. The Free Baptists and Methodists have preaching here a part of the time. Eaton has three public schoolhouses, and school property to the value of $1,100. The valuation of estates in 1880 was $88,294. The rate of taxation was 7 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 81. In 1880 it was 314. Eddillg'tOll, in Penobscot County, lies on the eastern bank of the Penobscot, 5 miles E.N.E. of Bangor. It is on the Air Line stage-route to Aurora, in Hancock County. Bradley bounds it on the north, Clifton on the east, Holden on the south and Veazie and Orono on the west, separated by Penobscot River. The town is irregular in form, curving away from the river south-eastward to a distance of about 10 miles, while its width is scarcely 3 miles. The area is about 9,000 acres. The surface is uneven and in some parts broken. A broad-topped hill called Black Cap Mountain in the south-eastern part, is the highest elevation. Holbrook and Davis Ponds, having a broad connecting stream, lie on the western line of the southern portion of the town ; and Nichols Pond lies upon the eastern line near the middle of the town. The two first are about 1 mile square, the last 3 miles. The outlet stream of the two first, connecting with the last, has a total"], [222, "214 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. fall of 45 feet in three-fourths of a mile. On this, at East Eddington, are saw, shingle and grist mills, and a clothes-pin, spool and axe fac tories. Other manufactures of the town are bricks, coopers-ware, car riages, etc. The nearest market and railway station are at Bangor. Eddington Bend, on the Penobscot, is the other village. Both villages contain many tasteful dwellings, and the streets are numerously set with shade trees. This township, at the recommendation of Congress, was granted to Jonathan Eddy and nineteen others, in consideration of their services and sufferings in connection with the Revolution. They were resi dents of Nova Scotia, but fled thence in 1776, on account of the perse cution of the British. This grant was made in 1785, and the place was immediately settled. The town was incorporated in 1811, taking its name from Col. Eddy, the principal settler. The Methodists have a neat church at Eddington Bend, and the Universalists, at East Eddington. The number of public schoolhouses in the town is seven, and the total school property is valued at $1,800. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $165,235. In 1880 it was $128,767. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2\\ per cent. The popula tion in 1870 was 776. In 1880 it was 746. Eddl, in Hancock County, occupies the northern and eastern por tion of Mount Desert Island. It embraces an area of 22,000 acres, about 1,000 of yvhich are covered by water. In the north-west is Western Bay ; in the north is Thomas Bay, which receives the waters of the largest stream on the island, North-Eastern Brook. North of this are Mount Desert Narrows, separating the island and the mainland. The principal eminences are Newport Mountain (1,060 feet in height), Mc- Farland's Mountain (764 feet), the White Cap (925 feet), Mount Kebo (405 feet), Interlaken Hill (462 feet), Great Hill (748 feet). Dry Moun tain and Green Mountain (1,522 feet), 4 miles S.S.W. of Bar Harbor, are partly in Eden. \"The view from Green Mountain is delightful. No other peak of the same height can be found on the Atlantic coast of the United States, from Lubec to the Rio Grande, nor from any other point of the coast can so fine a view be obtained. The boundless ocean on the one side contrasting with high mountains on the other, and along the shore numerous islands, appearing like gems set in liquid pearl, form the most prominent features in the scene. White sails dotted over the water glide slowly along. We know not what view in nature can be finer than this, where the two grandest objects in nature, high mountains and a limitless ocean, occupy the horizon. The name of Eden is truly appropriate to this beautiful place.\" Twenty miles out on the ocean is seen Mount Desert Rock, with its light-house beaming a fixed white light. In the west are numerous mountains of the island, with bright lakes interspersed, while the Camden Mountains are seen in the distance. It is claimed that Mount Katahdin, 100 miles to the north, and Mount Washington, 140 miles west, can sometimes be seen from this point. Whittier, in Mcgg Megone, has a passage on this locality. Granite, sometimes porphyritic in its character, is the prevailing rock in town. The soil varies from loam to gravel, with some marsh. Wheat, corn, oats, potatoes and barley are all raised to some extent. There are two saw-mills for long lumber, two shingle and two clap-"], [223, "EDGECOMB. 215 board mills. Agriculture and the fisheries are both carried on to a considerable extent ; but the chief employment of the people is cater ing to the wants of summer visitors. Bar Harbor, the principal vil lage, is situated on the east side of the island. It has a fine sea view, extending across Porcupine Island, in Frenchman's Bay, to the rol ling hills of Goldsborough. There are beaches near the village ; and a high rocky islet near by is the summer residence of General Fre mont. About one and a half miles south of the village is Cromwell's Cove, noted for its bold cliff shores, on one of which is the ro^k-figure called the Assyrian. The Indian's Foot (a foot print in the rock) and the Pulpit are in this vicinity. Four miles south of Bar Harbor is Schooner Head, a high, wave-washed cliff, with a white formation on its seaward side, which resembles a schooner under sail. It is said to have been cannonaded by a British frigate in the war of 1812. About two and a half miles north of Bar Harbor is the little seaport of Hull's Cove. Here is a neat crescent beach, where the Gregoire's dwelt, the hereditary proprietors of most of the region ; Madame Gregoire being a grand-daughter of the Gascon noble, Condillac, to whom the King of France granted Mount Desert in 1688. About two miles north of this place, across the promontory, is Salisbury Cove, a port for small ves sels. The Via Mala is a long passage in the neighboring cliffs. A short distance eastward from this on the northern angle of the prom ontory, is the little hamlet of Sand Cliff ; and near it are the Ovens, a range of caves in the porphyritic cliffs. All over the island are found elm, birch, maple, cedar, and the evergreens, in large tracts and scat tered groups. The first English settlement of the town was in 1763, by two fam ilies named Thomas and Higgins. Eden was taken from Mount Desert and incorporated in 1796. The name was probably adopted in honor of Richard Eden, an early English author. There is also a tradition that its natural beauties suggested its name. [See also Tremont and Mount Desert]. There are Baptist, Episcopal and Union churches in the town. The public library contains about 1,200 volumes. A high school is sustained for a portion of the year. Eden has thirteen public school houses, and its school property is valued at $8,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $196,499. In 1880, it was $177,534. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 16 mills on the dollar. The popula tion in 1870 was 1,195. In the census of 1880 it was 1,629. Edeil Falls, a post-office and small village in Naples, Cumber land County. Edg\"eCOinb, in the southern part of Lincoln County, is situ ated upon. the peninsula formed by the Sheepscot and Damariscotta Rivers, having Newcastle on the north and Bootbhay upon the south. At the north-western part it connects with Wiscasset by a bridge seven eighths of a mile in length, across the Sheepscot. West of the south ern part is the town of Southport, a long island in the Sheepscot River. The surface of the town is moderately irregular being varied both by alluvial gorges and by hills. The highest of the latter is known as Mount Hunger. Granite is the principal rock. Crystal Pond, near the centre of the town, has an area of about 100 acres ; Matthews Pond, about 40 acres. A mineral spring in this town called the \" Rosicrucian Spring,\" has be-"], [224, "216 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. come favorably known in some of our cities. The soil of Edgecomb is sandy loam in the uplands, and clayey in the lowlands. The crops are hay, barley, oats, and potatoes. Ice is a large product, there being two corporations and one or more individuals engaged in the business. The other considerable manufacture is brickmaking, which is carried on in many localities. A stream proceeding southward from a pond near the centre of the town furnishes two or more good powers, where were formerly mills, now fallen into ruins. Folly Island, at the north-west ern side of the town, sustains the Edgecomb end of the bridge to Wiscas set, and on its south-western point, commanding the entrances to the harbor, is an octagonal block house, erected during the war of 1812. At the shore below is Fort Edgecomb, an elaborate work of masonry, constructed in 1808-9. Its aspect, as viewed from the water ap proaches, is quite formidable. The passage between this island and Wesport Island is known as \" Hooper's Narrows.\" Edgecomb was originally settled in 1744 by Samuel Trask and others, in \" several places.\" After living undisturbed upon their lands for ten years under a possessory claim, three men from Boston appeared and challenged their title to them in virtue of an Indian deed. The new claimants surveyed several lots next the Sheepscot and numbered them. The Indian deed was found to have no definite boundaries, no posses sion had been taken under it, and the matter savored strongly of spec ulation. When made acquainted with these facts, a gentleman of the bar in Boston undertook the defence of the settlers without fee or reward, and the three claimants abandoned their claim. In compliment to the lawyer's generosity, the plantation took the name of Freetown, which it retained until it was incorporated as a town in 1774. The name was given by the General Court in honor of Lord Edgecomb, who, at this crisis, was distinguished as a friend to the American Colonies. The Island of Jeremisquam (now Westport), was included in the corpo ration, but was held by the \" Wiscasset Proprietors,\" who compelled the settlers to purchase of them. The island was set off in 1828. Soon after 1800 there was again difficulty in regard to the squatters' rights, as the lands were supposed to be involved in the \"Tappan \" claim. [See Newcastle]. But though this town escaped, it was embraced in the Resolve of Feb. 25, 1813, for quieting the squatters, and the lots were surveyed and deeds given the settlers by Jeremiah Bailey and Benja min Orr, commissioners appointed by the executive for the purpose. By these deeds, the commonwealth quit-claimed its right to the laud for 13\u00a3 cents per acre. A church was first formed in Edgecomb in 1783. Rev. Benjamin Chapman, the first settled minister, was installed in 1801. He died in 1804, and was succeeded in 1807 by the Rev. Samuel Sewall. About the time that Mr. Chapman was settled, Timothy Cuningham, a resi dent of the town, of the Freewill Baptist persuasion, was made elder of that soceiety. Moses Davis, Esq., was the first representative of the town in the General Court. He was also a member of the conven tion by which Massachusetts ratified the Constitution of the United States. Among later citizens worthy of note were Isaac Pool and Rufus Sewall, Esqrs., and Captain John Chase. The town has a library association possessing a library numbering upwards of 300 hundred volumes. The Congregationalists and Metho dists each have a church in the town. Edgecomb has seven public"], [225, "ELIOT. 217 schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $3,500. The valua tion of estates in 1870 was $202,428. In 1880 it was $189,440. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 1\u00a3 per cent. The population in 1870 was 1,056. In 1880 it was 872. Edmunds lies near the south-eastern extremity of Washington County on the western side of Cobscook Bay. Dennysville and Pem broke bound it on the north, Marion on the West, and Whiting and Trescott on the south. The area is 17,696 acres. The surface of the town is moderately uneven. Denny's River forms the boundary line on the north-east side of the town, and Cathance River flows east across the northern part. The latter has three considerable falls, known re spectively as the Mill Seat, The Flume, \u2014 embracing three pitches, \u2014 and Great Works. The last has mills. Cathance Lake, situated about ten miles north-west, is the reservoir for this stream, and has an area of six or seven square miles. Bull's Meadow Brook, Burnt Cove Stream, Little Falls Stream, each has one or more powers, but without much improvement. Those on the last are the Rock, the Falls, and a tide power near the mouth of the river. There is at present only one con siderable mill in the town. Cattle raising and sea-faring constitute the chief occupation of the people. The north-eastern part of the town is most numerously settled. The nearest post-office is Dennysville. The town was formerly Number 10 ; and was purchased of Massa chusetts in 1786 by Col. Aaron Hobart, of Abington, Mass., for $2,200. Rufus Putnam, of Boston, was the chief surveyor. James Neil an Irish man who deserted from theBritish army, was the first settler, buildinghis log house in 1775. He had shot two of his pursuers, but in 1793 he re moved into the British Dominion of New Brunswick. Nathaniel Ho bart, a son of the proprietor, came and built a mill in 1787, but after following the lumber business ten years, he sold it to Phineas Bruce, an eminent Machias lawyer. Many had settled in the town for a few years, then moved to other places. In 1792, Isaac Hobart, another son of the first proprietor, built a house and mill. On the death of his father he purchased the wild lands belonging to the heirs, and became owner of three-fourths of the township. His three sons, Aaron, Isaac, and Benjamin, succeeded to his lands. Samuel Runnels and family came in 1796. He had been a soldier of the Revolution. The Methodists have a church in this town, and usually sustain a minister. Edmunds has four public schoolhouses, which, with other school property, are valued at $1,000. The value of the estates in 1870 was $86,418. In 1880 it was $72,331. The population in 1870 was 448. In 1880 it was 445. EllOt, situated in the north-western part of York County, on tjie eastern bank of Piscataquis River, was incorporated under its present name in 1810. Previously to this it was the north parish of Kittery, and bore the name of Sturgeon Creek. Walter Neal, as the agent of Gorges and Mason, made grants of land here in 1632; and it is thought to have had settlers a little before this date. One of the earliest settlers of whom we have a definite account was Nicholas Frost, who settled at Sturgeon Creek about 1636. He filled various offices of the town, and died in 1663 at the age of seventy-four years. He has many descendants, several of whom have been eminent in their"], [226, "218 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. generation. Other early settlers were the Hills, who came about 1670 or 1680 ; Anthony Emery, who came before 1652, as he was one of the selectmen in that year; James Tobey came about 1675, receiving a town grant in 1687, and was killed by the Indians about 1705; John Heard, was an early settler and a noted school-teacher in his day ; Nathan Bartlett and his brother, who were tanners, came about 1713. The first settlers were allowed to take up as much land as they could fence, on condition of paying 2 or 2\u00a3 shillings per acre for 100 years. The best, if not the only, \"garrison-houses standing in town in 1870 were the two upon the farm \"of Joseph Frost, Esq., having been built by his grandfather about 1735 and 1740. During the war of the Rebellion the town provided its full quota of men, paying on an average $400 bounty. Among the memorable names of former days are those of the Bart letts, and Alpheus Hanscom, teachers ; Rev. John Rogers, first minis ter of the Congregational church, in its service for fifty-two years, until his death in 1768 ; also Rev. Alpheus Spring, his successor, and Rev. Samuel Chandler, who followed ; Captain Moses Paul of the Methodist church, and the Aliens, Fryes, Neales and Jenkins, of the Society of Friends. Along the Piscataqua, the surface of the land is generally level and sloping to the river. Near the middle of the town is an exten sive bog swamp ; while in the east and north-east the surface is quite hilly. The highest eminences are Frost's, Third or Bartlett's, and Raitt hills. In the north-east of the town is York Pond, from which flows the western branch of York River. The soil is generally good, and much attention is given to orcharding. The common trees flourish wild, and at the roadsides, particularly along the river, there are many noble shade trees. The Piscataqua River sends two arms or creeks into the town, Sturgeon Creek, and in the south-west Oramphea gan, which, with the river, forms a peninsula called the Neck. The Piscataqua is navigable the whole length of the town, while Great Bay opens opposite, affording water communication with several New Hampshire towns. The farm-houses and buildings are generally neat and in good repair ; while the western part adjacent to the river is adorned with handsome cottages, with gardens and fine orchards. The west branch of York River gives several small water-powers, which are improved by one grist-mill and two saw-mills. A small tide-power on Sturgeon Creek was also utilized in early times. The Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroad passes through the midst of the town, from north-east to south-west, having a station at the centre and another near the head of Sturgeon Creek, where it finds connection with shipping. The town has one Congregational and one Advent church, and two Methodist churches. Eight schoolhouses, valued at $5,000, afford the facilities of public school education to the children. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $535,982. In 1880 it was $462,060. The popula tion at the same date was 1,769 ; in 1880 it was 1,640. EllillgWOOd'S Corner, a post village in Winterport Waldo County. ElliotSVille is situated in the southern part of Piscataquis County. It is bounded on the north by Greenville and the Bowdoin"], [227, "ELLS WORTH. 219 College grant, east by township Number Seven, Ninth Range, west by Shirley, and south by Howard and Monson. Within its limits are two lofty eminences, Boarstone and Peaked Mountains; in its south-eastern part lies Ship Pond ; Wilson's Stream crosses its south-west corner, there receiving the Little Wilson. On these united are some good mill privileges ; while above on Little Wilson is one of the most re markable cataracts of the east. This is a fall of 80 feet perpendicular. Clapboard cuts have sometimes been driven over this fall, but many of them would come up in the stream below, split and quartered from end to end. The township has still a fair amount of pine and spruce tim ber, and some good agricultural soil; but there is much waste land. The first grant in this town was a mile in width on the west side to the Massachusetts Medical Society. The next grant was of half a town ship to the heirs of William Vaughan (a leading officer of the Louis burg expedition of 1745) for services rendered the State by him, the heirs selecting the northern half of this township on the east of the Medical Society's tract. Four thousand acres being granted to the Saco Free Bridge Company, this also was located in the township south of the Vaughan tract. Two other small parcels in the south part on either side of Ship Pond were purchased by Elliot G. Vaughan and a Mr. Watson. Eventually, E. G. Vaughan became chief owner of the territory of the heirs of that surname in town. Joseph Sawyer, from Buxton, was the first to move his family in. E. G. Vaughan built a saw-mill on the Little Wilson Stream, and E. T. Bridge built a grist mill on the Wilson. Hoping to hasten settlements thereby, he pro cured a town incorporation for the township in 1835, giving it his own Christian name. A county road was opened to Monson, school dis tricts established, and a school fund secured by the sale of the reserved lands, but the incorporation proved premature. The inhabitants de creased, and in 1858, in response to their petition, the act of incorpo ration was repealed ; since which time the township has been without an independent civil organization. The population iu 1870 was 42. In 1880 it was 55. Valuation in 1880, $11,020. ELLSWORTH, the shire town and only city of Hancock County, is situated at the head of Union River Bay, and near the centre of the county. The territorial area is between 60,000 and 70,000 acres. Union River passes southward through the middle of the town. Branch, Beech Hill and Reed's are the principal ponds. The surface of the land is generally broken, especially on the western side of the river. Mountain Rock is reported to be the greatest elevation. The stage-road, the main thoroughfare of the town, passes through a section of metamorphic ledges, on which rest many erratic boulders. Those found between Falls'Village and the \" Craigs \" are said.to sur pass all others in the county for size. The land would be regarded as generally better suited for sheep-ranges than for the cultivation of crops. The business portion of the town is situated about the Falls. These cover a distance of 2 miles, extending from the upper and business portion knoun as \"Falls Village\" to the Bridge, having in that space a total fall of 85 feet. The holding capacity of the supplying ponds is estimated at 5,500,000,000 cubic feet, and the water annually discharged over these falls at 17,500,000,000 cubic feet. The mills and factories con-"], [228, "220 GJlZETTEER OF MAINE. sist of two grain-mills, an excelsior and a planing-mill, eight long-lumber mills, with a productive capacity of 40,000,000 feet of lumber annually; five stave-mills, with a productive capacity of 25,000,000 annually. Shingles, clap-boards and laths are also made in nearly all these mills. Other manufactures are boxes, bricks, furniture, wool rolls, carriages, coopers' ware, carpenters' trimmings, iron castings, maible work, ship pumps and blocks, sails, vessels and boats, leather, tinware, etc. At North Ellsworth also there is a tannery. Ellsworth Town Hall is a brick building two stories in height, with an audience room having a seating capacity of 800. The lower story is used for a high-school. The county buildings and custom-house, with the church-edifices of the UPPER DAM, AT ELLSWORTH, ME. Congregationalists, Baptists, Methodists, Unitarian and Catholics, are also more or less impressive and pleasing structures. Shade trees, of maple and elm, from one to eighty years' growth, adorn the streets. The nearest railroad station in 1881 is at Bucksport, 20 miles distant. A railroad between the two places is projected. Ellsworth is on the Bangor and Calais stage-line, and is itself a stage centre for the south ern part of the county. The Hancock County Savings Bank, located at Ellsworth, in 1880 held deposits and profits to the amount of $72,544.08. \"The Ellsworth American,\" issued by the Hancock Publishing Company, is the only well-established newspaper in the county, having been published con-"], [229, "EMBDEN. 221 tinuously since 1853. There is a good public library, assiduously read. The usual entertainments of a city are found here. Benjamin Millikin is said to have been the first settler in the town, having come in 1763; and, according to the \"oldest inhabitant,\" his daughter Elizabeth cooked the first meal prepared by white people in Ellsworth \"by the side of a huge bowlder, which stood where Dutton's store now is.\" The next settlers were Meltiah Jordan, Benjamin Joyr, Colonel Jones, George Lord, Nathaniel and John Jellison. Others soon followed these. The first children born were Edward and Susan Beal. Twenty years after its settlement the township had a population of 992. The first minister was Rev. J. Urquhart, who came in 1785. The Rev. Peter Nourse was ordained in 1812. As a plantation the township bore the name of New Bowdoin. It was incorporated in 1800, being named in honor of Oliver Ellsworth, one of the delegates to the National Constitutional Convention, held a few years subsequent to the Revolution. It comprised Township No. 7 (of the \"Ten Town ships\"), a part of Township No. 6, and the north-west part of Trenton. The part taken from No. 6 was annexed to Surry soon after 1820, but was re-annexed to Ellsworth in 1829. Ellsworth became the shire town in 1838, and a city in 1869. James F. Davis was the first mayor. It is said that all the buildings now standing south of Main street have been erected within about sixty-five years. The first framed house is still standing in the rear of the \" Clark and Davis\" store. It is to be supposed that \"ye olden custom\" of breaking a bottle and naming the building by some bold and nimble citizen bestriding the ridge-pole when the raising was completed, was observed here. The descriptive rhyme for this house ran thus; \" This is a good frame; It deserves a good name. What shall we call it ? Josh Moore's folly, And Pond's delight. The lawyer has got it \u2014 It looks like a fright.\" Ellsworth is the home of Hon. Eugene Hale, U. S. Senator, and of his law-partner, Hon. L. A. Emery, a few years since attorney-general of Maine. Colonel Z. A. Smith, of the Boston \"Journal,\" was for a time a resident of the town. The city furnished 653 men for the Union cause during the Rebellion. The bounties paid by the city amounted to $49,600. Ellsworth has twenty-two public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $25,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,233,199'. In 1880 it was $1,456,366. The rate of taxa tion in 1880 was 21\u00a3 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 5,257. In the census of 1880 it was 5,051. Elllbdeil lies in the southern part of Somerset County, on the west bank of the Kennebec River, about 40 miles north of Augusta. It is bounded on the north by Concord and Lexington, east by Solon, south by Anson, and west by New Portland. The surface of the town is hilly. The highest eminence is Black Hill, situated in the western part of the town. There arc many ledges, and the soil is rocky, ex cept at the south-west corner of the town, where there are some good"], [230, "222 GAZEETER OF MAINE. intervals. The largest crop is hay. The forests contain the usual variety of trees. The sheets of water are Embden Pond, near the middle of the town, having an area of 1,535 acres; Hancock Pond, at the north-west corner, containing 325 acres ; and Sandy and Falii ponds, smaller, connected with Fahi, in the south-eastern part of the town, with several still smaller. On the outlet of Embden Pond were a few years since two saw-mills for long and short lumber, and a grist-mill, turning-lathes, threshing-machine, etc. There are other powers and mills on Martin and Mill streams, outlets of ponds in Con cord, and on Seven Mile Brook. The first settlements in town were made along the river in 1779, by Amos Partridge, George Mitchell, and William Hamblin. In 1782 Samuel Hutchins and a Mr. Young located on Seven Mile Brook, at the south-west corner of the town. They were followed by Capt. John Gray, from Wiscasset, and in 1790 by Thomas McFaden, Joseph Cleveland, with his sons, Jonathan and Luther, and Edward Savage; and at about the same time came John Chamberlain and his sons, Jeremiah and Stephen. John was the son of the John Chamberlain who shot the Pequaket chief, Paugus. (See Fryeburg.) On \"Indian Ledge,\" in this town are numerous cuttings in the surface of the rock representing objects familiar to the aborigines. The ledge inclines to the water at an agle about 40\u00b0, and the portion marked is about 12 feet long by 3 to 6 feet wide. Some of the figures are as follows: two warriors and two squaws, dog and deer, bow and arrows, a canoe with Indians, two crosses, a small wigwam and a larger house of English form, etc. A Penobscot Indian to whom these were shown acknowl edged that he could not read the inscription, but said that there was one member of his tribe who could. This ledge is situated about 2 miles below Caratunk Falls. Embden was incorporated June 22, 1804. The active religious societies are Methodist. The town has eleven schoolhouses, valued, with appurtenances, at $2,300. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $207,793. In 1880 it was $171,203. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2-,-9D8(j cents on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 803. In 1880 it was 674. Elliery'S MillS, a post-office in York County. Enfield lies upon the east bank of the Penobscot River, in Pen obscot County, opposite the mouth of the Piscataquis, and about 35 miles north of Bangor. Lincoln bounds it on the north, Lowell on the east and south, Howland and Matamiscontis on the west, having the Penobscot as a dividing line. The town contains 15,000 acres; but Coldstream Pond, on the eastern side, occupies about one-third of this area. The surface oi the western part of the town is level, but the eastern part is much broken. In the north-eastern part are some ledges of a superior quality of granite. The soil of the eastern part is productive ; that in the west is a clay loam, and is less fertile. Hay is the chief crop. Coldstream Pond, 5 miles long and 2 wide, is a fine sheet of water, fed mostly by springs, and well-stocked with the finny tribe. The outlet falls into the Passadumkeag about 4 miles below, and fur nishes excellent water-power The principal fall is about 50 feet in 80 rods. The entire series of privileges is known as Treat's Mills, and"], [231, "EUSTIS. 223 have been occupied by saw-mills, shingle and grist-mills. The Euro pean and North American Railway runs through the midst of the town, between the pond and the river. The Baptists have a settled minister, and meetings are sometimes held by the Methodists. Enfield has seven public schoolhouses, valued, with appurtenances, at $1,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $90,204. In 1880, it was $64,224. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 33 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 545. In 1880 it was 489. Ejllfl is a small town in the south-western part of Penobscot County, 17 miles west of Bangor. The Maine Central Railroad runs through the north-eastern part. Stetson and Levant bound it on the north, Carmel on the east, Dixmont on the south, and Plymouth on the west. The surface is quite broken, but the soil is, for the most part, a good, light loam, producing fine crops of potatoes and hay. Pine, spruce and hemlock are the principal forest trees. Etna and Carmel Pond lies on the north-eastern corner of the two towns whose names it bears. Its area is about three-fourths of a sguare mile. The town is drained by several small streams, \u2014 Kinsley and Soadabscook Streams being the largest. Kinsley Stream furnishes some water powers, two of which have been occupied by a saw-mill and a shingle mill. The pursuits of the people are chiefly agricultural. The buildings are generally in fair condition ; and a few maples and elms along the roadside here give token of good taste and public spirit. Etna (P. O.), near the railway station, has the largest collec tion of houses. The other post-offices are Etna Centre and South Etna. The first settlements in this town were made in 1807 by Dr. Benj. Friend, Phineas Friend, James Harding, Dennis and Reuben Dennett, and Bela, Asa and Calvin Sylvester and others. At this time General John Crosby, of Hampden, owned the- township ; and it was known as Crosbytown until about the time of its incorporation in 1820. The Baptist house is the only church-edifice in the town. Etna has eight schoolhouses valued, with appurtenances, at $2,600. The valu ation of estates in 1870 was $154,339. In 1880 it was $162,209. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 22 mills on the dollar. Tho population in 1870 was 844. In 1880 it had increased to 895. EUFek<lj a post-office in Kenebec County, EUStlS is (1881) the most northerly town in Franklin County. It is No. 1 of Range 4, west of Bingham's Kennebec Purchase. Som erset County adjoins it on the east. There are several good water powers on Dead River and its branches. On one of the latter, in the northern part of the town are a shingle, saw-mill and grist-mill. Con nected with the latter, also, is a planing-mill. These constitute Eustis Mills, the principal business centre of the town. Dead River enters the northern side of the town, and receiving Saddleback River from the south-west, continues nearly to the south-east corner, then turns north-east and enters Flagstaff. Two roads lead to the settled towns southward and to a railroad connection at Anson, there being a stage-"], [232, "224 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. line by the former route. The distance on an airline is about 35 miles. One of these passes through Flagstaff and Dead River Plantation, while the other follows Carrabasset River. Some time before Maine became a State, the southern half of this township was granted by Massachusetts to Bath Academy Associa tion. About 1,700 acres of this lying south of the Saddleback River was purchased by Gilman and Redington, of Waterville. Caleb Stevens, a native of New Hampshire, was the first settler. He brought with him his wife and nine children, the eldest, a son being eighteen years of age. Abram Reed, of Kingfield, was the second settler ; and was soon followed by Capt. Isaac Proctor, Frank Keen, Nathaniel Allen, and Reuben Bartlett, from Hartford, and Noah Staples, from Dixfield. The balance of the Bath Academy Grant was purchased by Captain Pettingill and Colonel Herrick, of Lewiston. From them it went through various hands to Gibson, Fogg and Company, of Fair field. The north half of the township was purchased of the State about the year 1831, by a Mr. Clark, of Massachusetts, and Charles L. Eustis, of Lewiston, Me.; and a saw and grist mill was built by the latter at the same date. From them it went through the hands of a New Hampshire firm to ex-governor Coburn and his brothers. In 1840 the township was organized as a plantation under the name of Hanover. About 1850 the township together with all others ad joining in the county that contained inhabitants, were embodied in a plantation under the name of Jackson. Soon after the act of Legisla ture passed in 1857, prohibiting the organization of more than one township in one plantation, township No. 1, of the 4th Range was organized independently of others, assuming the name of Eustis in honor of the former proprietor of the north half of said town. Eustis furnished more than her quota of men and money in the war of the Rebellion, and paid her war-debts while money was plenty. She was subsequently reimbursed by the State. Eustis was incorporated as a town in 1871, with a population of 342 inhabitants. The Methodists and Free Baptists each have a church in the town. The number of public schoolhouses is four; and these with the other school property are valued at $600. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $57,558. In 1880 it was $64,880. The population in 1870 was 342. In 1880 it was 302. Exeter is an excellent agricultural town in the south-western part of Penobscot County. It is 20 miles north-west of Bangor, on the stage-line from Bangor to Dexter, and is the terminus of the\" stage line from Etna station on the Maine Central Railroad. The town~is bounded on the east by Corinth, south bv Stetson, north by Garland, and west by Corinna. Its area is about 33 square miles. The surface is uneven, but the soil in general is excellent, though it contains almost all varieties. Hay and potatoes are the crops principally cultivated. The rock is chiefly granitic. The prevailing forest trees are maple and cedar. The Kenduskeag is the largest stream, rising in the north western part, and flowing in a curve through the middle of the town. It furnishes in its course eight distinct powers, all of which have been improved and occupied by mills. Not many years ago, there were upon the streams of Exeter, three saw-mills fo\"r long lumber, seven shingle-mills, four grist-mills, a machine-shop, a carriage-shop and a"], [233, "FjilRFIELD. 225 tannery. There are now two water-power saw-mills and one steam mill for manufacturing staves and short lumber. The other streams furnishing power are Andrew's and Atkin's brooks. Exeter Corners, in the north part of the town, Exeter Mills, in the eastern part, East Exeter, and South Exeter, are villages and post-offices, the first men tioned being the largest. The villages have many tasteful residences, and the buildings in the town generally indicate thrift. The township, which is now Exeter, was granted by Massachusetts to Marblehead Academy in 1793, and the exterior lines of the town were run the same year by Ephraim Ballard and Samuel Weston. The township was lotted in 1800, by Moses Hodsdon, of Kenduskeag. Lemuel Tozier and John Durgin did the first chopping on June 6, 1800, at Hill's Corner. The first settlement was made in 1801, by Lemuel Tozier ; who was soon followed by Reuben Seavey, Joseph Pease and Josiah Barker. Among the early proprietors were Benja min Jay and William Turner, of Boston, for whom Dr. John Blaisdell acted as agent. Hence, prior to its incorporation, Feb. 16, 1811, the plantation was called Blaisdelltown. The corporate name was chosen in memory of Exeter, N. H., from which some of the settlers had come. The first school was taught by Ann Stevens in 1804. The first repre sentative to the General Court was Winthrop Chapman. The first mills were built in 1813, by Levi Stevens, where since have stood the Cutler Mills. The Episcopalians, Methodists and Free Baptists each have a church in this town. Exeter has thirteen public schoolhouses, valued with appurtenances, at $3,200. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $377,007. In 1S80 it was $426,151. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 16 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,424. In 1880 it was 1,274. Fairbanks, a post-office in Franklin County. Fairfield lies on the west bank of the Kennebec River, 26 miles north of Augusta, and is the most southerly town of Somerset County. It is bounded on the north by Norridgewock and Skowhe gan, east by Clinton and Benton, south by Waterville and Winslow, and west by Smithfield. Its area is 42 square miles. The surface is roll ing, and the rocks are granite and slate. The forest trees are principally beech, elm and maple with some hemlock and cedar. The scenery is beautiful without wildness. The dwellings are generally neat and tasteful, and the whole town has a thrifty appearance. Fairfield is an excellent agricultural town, and is noted for the number and quality of its cattle. The soil is clayey loam in some parts, in others, sandy loam. The crops chiefly cultivated are hay, grain and potatoes- Kennebec River forms the eastern boundary line, and furnishes the chief water-powers. These are at Kendall's M'ills, at the south-eastern extremity of the town, and Somerset Mills, about two miles above. On Martin'sStream are improved powers at North Fairfield (Blacknell's Mills) and at Larone (Winslow's Mills). Other villages are Fairfield Corner, near the middle of the eastern line of the town, and Fairfield Village, about midway of the southern part. The latter and Kendall's Mills are the largest villages. There are in the town eight saw-mills, three planing-mills (one of which is also a framing and finishing mill) 15"], [234, "226 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. two door, sash and blind factories, a sled, lap-board and flower-stand factory, a grist and a plaster mill, three carriage-factories, a tannery, a canned-corn factory, a clothing-factory, cabinet, box, picture-frame, coffin and casket makers, marble-works, etc. The flow of the Ken nebec available for manufacturing purposes in Fairfield in the lowest run of summer, is 117,300 cubic feet per minute of 11 hours a day ; which would for that time yield on its 34 feet of fall, a gross power of 7,540 horse, or 301,000 spindes. The estimated annual products are given in the Hydrographic survey, as $75,000 at Somerset Mills, and $250,000 at Kendall's Mills. The Somerset branch of the Maine Central Railroad, connecting Waterville and Skowhegan, runs along the river through the town. The First National Bank, in this town, has a capital of $50,000. The Fairfield Savings Bank, at the beginning of the fiscal year 1880, held in deposits and accrued profits $93,685.09. The \" Fairfield Journal \" is a good weekly paper published here by Allen & Atwood. It is devoted to local news, and is deserving of the large circulation that the region is able to give. Fairfield was incorporated June 18, 1788, under the name it had previously borne as a plantation. The name appears to have been ap plied because it correctly described the fair aspect of the town. It was first settled in 1774. Among the esteemed citizens of past days were General Simonds, General Kendall, for whom the principal vil lage was named, General Seldon Connor, ex-governor of the State, and others. Fairfield was the 56th town incorporated. It had in 1790, 492 in habitants. A Congregational church was gathered in the town in 1815. There are now three Methodist churches, and one each of the Baptist, Free Baptist and Universalist. Fairfield has one high-school, and graded schools in the larger villages. The number of public schoolhouses is seventeen, and the value of school property is $10,000. The value of estates in 1870 was $1,188,383. In 1880 it was $1,288, 582. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 11 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 2,998. In 1880 it was 3,044. FallS Village, a small village in Ellsworth, Hancock County. FalmOlltll is situated a little south of the centre of Cum berland County. It is more than twice as long as broad ; and its greatest length is from south-east to north-west. The south-east of the town, known as Falmouth Foreside, borders on Casco Bay. On the north east it is bounded by Cumberland, on the north-wet by Windham and on the south-west by Westbrook and Deering. The Mackay's -the Brothers, and the Clapboard islands, off the shore belong to the town jurisdiction. The surface is agreeably diversified with hill and dale, forest and field ; having also considerable salt-marsh. The greatest elevations are Poplar Ridge, in the northern part of the town, and Black Strap Hill, a couple of miles southward of the latter. The The prevailing rocks are gneiss and granite. The soil is favorable to agriculture and is generally well-cultivated. Duck Pond, about two miles in length, lies at the north-western angle of the town. The Pre sumpscot passes through the south-western part, forming a consider able basin at its mouth. Piscataqua River, coming from the northern"], [235, "FALMOUTH. 227 part of the town, is a tributary of the Presumpscot. The other streams are the East Branch of the Piscataqua, and Mill Creek, in the middle and south-eastern part of the town respectively. The Grand Trunk Railway passes across the lower part of the town, and the Maine Cen tral across the middle. The latter crosses the Presumpscot on an iron bridge of a single span 135 feet in length. Falmouth has manufactures of brick at several points ; meal and flour at West Falmouth and New Casco ; carriages, boots and shoes and tinware, at Presumpscot Falls (Falmouth P. O.) ; hubs, spokes, carriage stock, brick and lumber machines at West Falmouth. The town was incorporated in 1718, being named for an ancient seaport in England. It originally extended from Spurwink River to North Yarmouth, and 8 miles back into the country, embracing a ter ritory of about 80 square miles. It thus included the present towns of Falmouth, Cape Elizabeth, Westbrook, Deering and Portland. The chief part of the history of ancient Falmouth will, therefore, be em braced in the history of Portland. The first settlement within the present corporate limits was as early as 1632, at Falmouth Foreside, by Arthur Mackworth, who soon after obtained a grant of 500 acres of land from Sir Ferdinando Gorges. He was one of the most respectable of the early settlers, servingas a magistrate for many years. The island opposite his residence has since borne his name, but corrupted into Mackay. This shore is now thickly occupied with neat and substantial farm-houses, and the more imposing edifices of thrifty ship-masters, together with a few summer residences of Portland citizens. Chief among these is that of Hon. Chas. W. Goddard, and Gen. John M. Brown's \" Thornhurst Farm,\" noted for its fine stock. The broad point on the eastern side of the Presumpscot Basin has much historic importance. The settlements on Presumpscot River in this town were among the first attacked. The family of Thomas Wakely, consisting of nine persons, remote from others, were destroyed with details of shocking barbarity ; one only, a girl of fourteen escap- ing massacre to be carried away captive. The fort and settlement at Casco Neck (Portland) was destroyed by the Indians in 1690, aud in 1698 in pursuance of the recent treaty, a fort and trading-house was erected at this point for the accommodation of the Indians ; wherefore the place came to be called New Casco to distinguish it from the Neck where Fort Loyal had stood, which was now called Old Casco. In 1703, Governor Dudley held a conference with the Indians here, to which came, well-armed and gaily painted, a large number of warriors of each tribe of Maine. The Androscoggins in attendence numbered about 250 warriors in 65 canoes. The chiefs professed the most peace- ful intentions, and the warriors celebrated the occasion in the most demonstrative manner ; yet within two months \" the whole eastern country was in a conflagration, no house standing or garrison unat tacked.\" In this war, New Casco was a centre of defence for the set tlements on Casco Bay. The attack upon it was made by 500 French and Indians, and it was only saved from capture by the opportune arrival of an armed vessel of the province, whose guns quickly scat tered the savage fleet of 250 canoes, and compelled the Indians to make a hastyr retreat. In 1716 the fort was demolished by order of the Massachusetts Government, to save the expense of maintaining a gar rison at this point. A short distance along the main road is a beauti-"], [236, "228 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. ful spot on Mill Creek, which for one hundred and forty years was occupied by a rude mill of the early settlers of the Foreside. The views for the whole extent of this road are very attractive, abounding in noble shade-trees and charming ocean views. The records of the town, previous to 1690, are not known to exist. In 1735, the people of New Casco petitioned for preaching, and in 1752, to be set off as a distinct parish. Accordingly, in December, 1753, this parish was incorporated, in 1754 the church was formed, and in 1756 John Wiswall was settled over it. Rev. Ebenezer Williams labored here from 1765 to 1799. There are now two Congregational churches, a Free Baptist and a Methodist church in the town. Falmouth sus tains a high-school, and is the owner of twelve schoolhouses valued at $7,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $688,527. In 1880 it was $769,470. The population in 1870 was 1,730. Bv the census of 1880, it was 1,626. Farillillg'dale, a little town made up in 1852 from parts of Gardiner, Hallowell and West Gardiner, in Kennebee County, lies on the west side of Kennebec River between Hallowell and Gardiner. Manchester forms the western boundary, and Chelsea lies upon the east, separated from it by the Kennebec. James and Henry McCaus land settled here in 1787, obtaining their titles from Dr. Sylvester Gar diner. The early history of the town belongs to those from which it was taken. The western part of the town is rough, but there are fine farms along the river. The nearness to good markets makes farming and garden ing profitable. Along the river are several ice-houses, among the largest of which are those of the Knickerbocker company. There are manu factures of stoneware, drain-tile and brick, and sandpaper and glue. Jamie and Sanborn ponds lie on the western border of the town. The business centres are adjoining Hallowell on one side, and Gardiner on the other. The Maine Central railway passes through the town along the river. Farmingdale has four schoolhouses, valued at $4,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $387,428. In 1880 it was $387, 842. The population at the same date was 859. The census of 1880 makes it 789. Farillillg'tOn, the shire town of Franklin County, is situated near its southern part. It is 10 miles long and 7 wide at the northern part. The area is 27,000 acres. Sandy River runs through it from north to south, dividing into nearly equal parts. The other large water-courses are Wilson's Stream and Beaver Dam Brook. There are numerous small streams and springs in every part of the town. Some of the high lands, particularly in the northern part, are somewhat rocky and difficult to cultivate ; but the soil is generally easily worked and fertile, especially in the intervals and adjacent uplands. The first, however, afford excellent pasturage, and are decked in their season with numerous flocks of sheep. Hay and wool are the principal agri cultural exports. Orchards of apple and other fruit-trees abound. Powder House Hill, just above Farmington Village, is the most nota ble eminence. There are several others, but none of great height. Limestone of poor quality exists in several places, but the rock generally is of slaty formation."], [237, "FARMINGTON. 229 Much of the surface of Farmington is considerably elevated above Sandy River Valley, of which fine views may be had from many parts of the town. Farmington, the principal village, is situated on a beautiful undu lating plain on the eastern bank of Sandy River near the centre of the town. Its streets are tr.rd and broad, and most of them have a double row of shade-trees. The top of Court street affords a fine landscape view toward the west, while from Powder House Hill, up and down the river, are views still more impressive. Some noble willows at the western extremity of the village sprang from twigs, cut on the way home from Augusta by Hiram Belcher, SCENERY AT ABBOTT FAMILY SCHOOL, FARMING-TON, ME. Esq., one of the early residents. A young lady's seminary which flourished here a few years since, occupying a fine eminence near by, took its name \u2014 The Willows \u2014 from these trees. More within the vil lage is a small park, with a band-stand, and a fine grove of maples near it. Six churches adorn the village, and dispense religious truth to the people. It is also the seat of the Western Normal School, of the noted Little Blue School, and the Wendell Institute. All of these have fine buildings and pleasant grounds. The Little Blue School is situated in an extensive park, consisting of hill and dale, shaded by numerous old and young trees, and enlivened with ponds, streams and bridges. There are in the town five lumber-mills, two sash, blind and"], [238, "230 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. door-factories \u2014 one run by steam-power, two brick-yards, one foundry, an excelsior and rake-factory, three grist-mills, nearly a dozen carriage factories, one cheese-factory, two corn-canning factories, two mowing machine manufactories, a spool-factory, tannery, etc. Farmington village is the present terminus of the Maine Central Railroad, and is 95 miles distant from Portland. Other villages are Farmington Falls, and North and West Farmington. This town was first explored with a view to settlement by Stephen Titcomb, Robert Gower, James Henry, Robert Alexander and James McDonald in the summer of 1776, being guided by Thomas Wilson, who had previously explored the region as a hunter. This company was from Topsham, and made the trip as far as Hallowell in canoes. At what is now Farmington Falls, they found two Indian camps, and an extensive clearing. Proceeding about a mile above the falls, they made a chain of basswood bark, with which they measured the land off into farms, then returned to Topsham to obtain their implements and a stock of provisions. In two weeks they were again at the scene of the proposed new settlement; and from this period until 1784 this company and others continued to make improvements in different parts of the town. The township belonged to a grant to William Tyng and company for services in 1703, and therefore as a plantation it had with \" Number One \" and \" Sandy River Plantation,\" also the name of \" Tyngstown.\" It was surveyed by Col. Joseph North in 1780, and new families immediately came in. By the proprietors of the Kennebec patent, the township was claimed to be within their limits ; but on its incorporation in 1794 it was found to be wholly outside. The good ness of its soil for agriculture was the occasion of gbing it the corpor ate name of Farmington. The corn-fields of the Canibas tribe of In dians were here. A post was established in Farmington in 1797 ; and the next year the town was represented in the General Court by Supply Belcher. Among the eminent citizens of the later period have been Jacob Ab bot, Esq., and Jacob and John S. C. Abbot, authors ; Hon. Hiram Belcher, Hon. Robert Goodenow, Rev. Isaac Rogers, and others. Far mington sent to the aid of the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion 268 men, of whom 57 were lost. Besides the libraries of the educational institutions n.entioned, there is a circulating library and also a social library of 1,5 JO volumes. The leading newspaper of the town and of the county is the \"Farmington Chronicle,\" published every Thursday, by Chas. W. Keyes, Esq. It is republican in politics. The other weekly paper of the town is \" The Herald,\" published by W. D. Chase. It is issued Friday. The \" Herald \" is greenback in politics, and a lively and enterprising sheet. The \" Excelsior Quarterly \" is an educational magazine, published by D. H. Knowlton. It is well filled with useful matter. The Franklin County Savings Bank, located at Farmington, at the close of 1879 held deposits and profits to the amount of $148,632.53. The Sandy River National Bank, in this town, has a capital of $75,000. The religious societies are two Congregationalist and three Metho dist churches, one Baptist, one Free Baptist, one Liberal Christian, and one Union church. Farmington has twenty-one public school houses, and her school property is valued at $15,850. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,448,735. In 1880 it was $1,601,271.

It is bounded on the east by Mount Vernon and Readfield, south by Wayne, west by Livermore, in Androscoggin County, and north by Chesterville in Franklin County. The first settlement in the township was about the year 1779. Seven thousand acres of its territory were granted by the State of Massachusetts to Robert Page and associates. Its early name was \" Starling Plantation \" ; and in 1790 it had 166 inhabitants. In 1795 it was incorporated as a town under the name of the noble French officer who gave the nation such efficient aid during the Revolution. Among the early settlers were Benjamin Clifford, William Morrill, Joel Jedkins, Nathan Lane, James Ely, James Bam ford, Elkins Chase, Stephen French, Tilton Richards, Eleazer Goodwin, Enoch Watson, Perley Dow, Jeremiah Tuck, Cyrus Baldwin, John and Hezekiah Judkins, Benjamin Bodge, Mathew Pettengill, Zachariah Pike, John Berry, and Joseph Anderson. There are now in town about 60 persons over seventy years of age. The town is much broken by hills, and there are several large ponds in and around it. The highest hills are Oak, Pine, Baldwin, and Berry's. The scenery from these hills is very fine, from the agreeable mingling of ponds, hills, meadows, and forests in the vicinity. Parker Pond at the nortk-east, Crotched Pond at the east, Lovejoy's and David's in the north, are the largest of these. Others are Tilton's, Lane's and Hale's Brook ponds. The principal business centre is Fayette Mills, near the south-east corner, where the Dunn Edge Tool Company do a large business in the manufacture of axes, scythes, and other cutting implements. In other parts of the town are manufactured long and short lumber, cabinet work, dowels, and boxes and measures. There is some granite in town, also pyritiferous mica-schist, and slate. The soil is generally good, and the town is noted for its dairy products, and its fine-wooled sheep. The post-offices are Fayette, North and South Fayette, and Fayette Cor ner. The town is situated about 18 miles from Augusta, on the stage-line between Readfield Depot and Chesterville. The Farmington branch of the Maine Central Railway runs through the adjoining town on the west, some 2 miles from the line; and the Readfield Depot on the east is about 7 miles distant. The Baptists and Methodists each have a church in the town ; and there is a public library of about 1,000 volumes. It has nine public schoolhouses, estimated to be worth $2,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $282,697. In 1880 it was $274,592. The population at the same date was 909. By the census of 1880 it is given at 765.

The township is about one-third larger than those about it. There is much good interval land along Dead River (which flows from west to east through the township) and on the streams which come down from the north and north-west to Flagstaff Lake. The principal crop is hay. Hills mark the north-eastern and western angles of the town. On the eastern side near Dead River, and near the middle of the town, is a considerable eminence called Viles's Hill ; and the base of Mount Bigelow extends over the southern border. The latter is 3,300 feet high. The rock is chiefly granitic. The plantation takes its name from the fact that Benedict Arnold, on his way to Quebec in 1775, while encamped here for three days, displayed the continental flag (which had recently been adopted) from a tall staff beside his tent. Flagstaff Pond, whose outlet furnishes the chief water-power of the plantation, has an area of 2.75 square miles. There are at this point mills manufacturing long and short lumber, and a grist-mill. The roads in the plantation are in good condition. There are bridges across Dead River and Flagstaff Stream, the longest being 175 feet in length. This plantation furnished 20 soldiers to the Union army in the war of the Rebellion. The Methodists are at present the most active religious body in the plantation. Flagstaff has one public schoolhouse which, with its appurtenances, is valued at $300. The value of estates in 1870 was $34,750. In 1880 it was $41,082. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 12 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 112. In 1880 it waB 72.

I1 OreSt StatlOll,; a post-office and railroad station on the European and North American Railway near Jackson Plantation, in Washington County: Forks Plantation is situated at the forks or junction of the east and west branches of the Kennebec River, whence its name. It is 50 miles N.N.W. of Skowhegan, on the Canada road, and on the stage-line from that town to Quebec. The principal business here is farming and lumbering. The place is on the route to Moosehead Lake. In the adjoining township on the north, a few miles above the Forks is a remarkable cataract on Moxie Stream, which has a precipitous descent of 95 feet. There is at the Forks a Methodist society, and a Union meeting house. There arc three public schoolhouses, and the entire school prop erty has a value of $1,300. The valuation in 1880 was $22,040. The population is massed with that of other plantations in the census; but in the return to the state superintendent of schools the number of children of school age is stated as being 75. [See West Forks.]"], [242, "234 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Fort Fairfield is situated on Aroostook River near its junction with the St. John, and has New Brunswick for its eastern boundary. It comprises two townships of excellent land. The Aroos took winds from west to east through its midst ; and along the south side of the river runs a branch of the New Brunswick Railway. The sur face is uneven, without high hills, and the town abounds in pleasing scenery. The principal streams tributary to the Aroostook in this town are Fitzherbert's Stream and Johnston, Lovely, Grey and Hurd Brooks. Livingstone River crosses the north-east corner of the town, receiving one considerable tributary from the west; and River DeChute, crossing the south-west corner, also receives a tributary stream from within the town. The principal water-powers are on Fitzherbert's Stream and Lovely Brook. There are on the various streams five saw-mills for long lumber and shingles, a planing and plaster mill, two grist-mills, two starch-factories, one cask and barrel factory, one furniture-factory, etc. The starch factories during the season of 1880 used 162,000 bushels of potatoes. The town is 46 miles north of Houlton, by stage r mte. A branch of the New Brunswick Railway has one or more stations in the town, and it is the terminus of stage-routes to Blaine, Van Buren and Andover, N. B. Fort Fairfield was incorporated March 11, 1858. The town then included only letter D.. lying mostly south of the Aroostook. In 1867, Plymouth Grant, called also \" Sarsfield Plantation,\" was annexed. The name was from the fort built within the town in the period of the b -rder difficulties. The fort was named for John Fairfield, who was governor at that period. The first settlements were about 1816, the settlers being from New Brunswick. The place assumed prominence from its position during the boundary fracas in 1839 ; following which, a company of United States troops were quartered there. The railroad that runs from Gibson, opposite Frederickton, N. B., reached the town in 1875. The town has associations of Masons, P. of H., and I.O.G.T. There are churches of the Episcopalians, Congregationalists, Bap tists, Methodists, Free Baptists, Roman Catholics and Univer salists. The village has a circulating library. The number of public schoolhouses is twenty-one. The value of the school property is $6,900. The value of estates in 1870 was $276,800. In 1880 it was $468,471. The population in 1870 was 1,893. In 1880 it was 2,807. Foi't Keilt is situated on the south bank of St. John's River, in the northern part of Aroostook County. It is 126 miles N.N. W. of Houlton via Caribou and Van Buren. Frenchville adjoins it on the east, Wallagrass Plantation on the south of the western half, and New Brunswick on the north. The territory is about 11 miles in length along the river east and west, and from 3 to 6^ miles in width. The surface is somewhat uneven with few hills above 200 feet in height. The streams that furnish water-power within the town are Fisii River and Daigle and Perley Brooks. The fall on the first is about a mill above its confluence with the St. John, and is occupied by a saw-mill having several single saws and a gang, and a grist-mill with four sets of stones. There is also a good power on the St. John River about a mile below the mouth of Fish River. Other powers are beim'"], [243, "FOXCROFT. 235 improved, and will doubtless soon mingle the hum of mills with the roar of their falls. Slate is the underlying rock. The soil of the upland is a dark loam, while there is some rich interval land. Oats, wheat, buckwheat, barley and potatoes are all cultivated, and yield well. The buildings in the town are generally in good repair, showing the people to be a thrifty community. The centre of business is near the mouth of Fish River. The town is the terminus of the stage-lines to the St. Francis. Fort Kent was first settled by Acadian-French refugees. The for tification from which the town takes its name was erected in 1841, and was named in honor of Governor Kent. Among the valued citizens not now living were I. H. Page, Major Wm. Dickey and B. W. Mallett. The church organizations are the Congregationalists and Roman Catholics. The latter have a church-edifice. The Madawaska Train ing School for Teachers, a State institution, is located here. Fort Kent has nine public schoolhouses, valued at $1,725. There are also 1,000 acres reserve land for public purposes. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $65,357. In 1880 it was $72,666. The population in 1870 was 1,034. In 1880 it was 1,512. FoXCl*Oft is situated in the southern part of Piscataquis County, having Bowerbank on the north, Dover on the south, Sebec on on the east and Guilford on the west. The town contains 17,915 acres. Sebec Lake occupies the larger part of the northern boundary. This body of water has an area of 14 square miles. Other ponds are Wes ton's, Snow's and Garland, being from a mile in length downward. The Piscataquis River forms the southern boundary, and the Weston, Chase and Hammond Brooks, as well as the river afford some water-power. The town has considerable granite, and also slate, some of which is said to be of the finest quality. The soil is various, but generally productive. The principal manufactures are at the village opposite Dover village on the Piscataquis. There are here a woolen-mill, lum ber and grain mills, a door, sash and blind factory, a spool-factory, an iron-foundry, a shoddy-mill, tannery, carriage-factory and several others. Foxcroft was one of the six townships given to Bowdoin College by Massachusetts. In 1880 it was purchased by Colonel Joseph E. Foxcroft, of New Gloucester, for the sum of $7,940, \u2014 about 45 cents an acre. In 1802 Colonel Foxcroft hired Elisha Alden to cut a road across the township at a cost of $73. This road passed from the Chandler place to the \" Four Corners,\" and thence over the hill to Morse's land ing, on Sebec Lake. John, Eleazer and Seth Spaulding were the first settlers ; moving in with their families in 1806, when they built the first mill. Mr. S. Chamberlin and Ephraim Bacon put up the first framed house in town in 1807 ; and Eliphalet Washburn, the same summer, raised the first barn in town. Captain Joel Pratt came in the next spring; others followed, among whom were Timothy Hutchinson, Joseph Morse, John Chandler and Jesse Washburne. Dr. Winthrop Brown, from Berwick, commenced the practice of medicine in Fox croft in 1809 or 1810. At a visit in one of the years just mentioned Colonel Foxcroft advised the inhabitants to hold religious meetings. The people readily"], [244, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 236 adopted his advice and met at the house of Eli Towne, bring ing such hymn-books as they had. Mr. William Mitchell, an old schoolmaster, was present with a book of sermons in his pocket, ready to read at the proper time. Desirous of opening the meeting in the usual form, inquiry was made for some one to make the opening prayer, but not a man in the settlement had the necessary piety and confidence to perform this simple duty. There was a woman present Mrs. William Mitchell, \u2014 who had kept up prayer in her family from its commencement, and at the solicitation of the company this \"Mother in Israel,\" made the first public prayer in Foxcroft. Rev. John Saw yer soon after began to perform religious services in the place in 1809 or 1810. The daughter of Mr. S. Chamberlain, now Mrs. Greeley, born in 1808, is still living, being the oldest person in town. Messrs. Nathaniel, Daniel, William and Moses Bucks, came from Buckfield later. The plantation had first been known as Spauldingtown. It was incorpo rated as the second town in the county in 1812, being named in honor of the chief proprietor. Mr. John Bradbury was chosen the first town clerk, and Messrs. Joel Pratt, S. Chamberlain, and William Thayer, selectmen and assessors. The war against England was declared this year, and there was much alarm in regard to the Indians. A meeting to consider the sub ject was held in Foxcroft in August. All thought there should be a fortification, but as most of the settlers along the river desired to have it on his own land, no agreement could be reached, and the project was abandoned. Finally Phineas Ames (known as King Ames), made a speech in a rough, but eloquent way peculiar to him, in which he counseled delay and moderation. The result of the deliberations was the choice of Mr. E. Bacon, to visit Boston as agent of the Piscataquis settlements to procure arms and ammunition for the State, providing that sufficient money was raised voluntarily to defray his expenses. But the money was not raised, and the agent did not go, though some abandoned their homes for safe locations, and all barricaded the doors for safety against a possible midnight assault. The Indians, however, showed no disposition to break the peace. The first store in town was opened by John Bradbury soon after 1813, who became quite successful as a merchant and mill owner. Bela Hammond & Sons a little later operated a kitchen-chair factory on Merrill Brook; and sometime after Benjamin Hammond & Com pany built a saw-mill and a bed-stead factory, and opened a store at the village. Charles P. Chandler, James S. Holmes, and Nathaniel Chamberlain were highly esteemed citizens in their day. Foxcroft sent near 150 soldiers to aid the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion ; of whom 40 were lost. The Congregationalists are the leading denomination in town, hav ing a handsome church-edifice and a chapel. For public entertain ments, the inhabitants give a preference to the more intellectual sort, as concerts and lectures. Foxcroft Academy was chartered in 1823, \u2014 the first institution of the kind north of Bangor, and still flourishing. The village schools are graded. Foxcroft has eight public school houses, valued at $4,000. \"in 1870 the valuation of\" estates was $400, 109. In 1880 it was $394,675. The rate of taxation in 1880 is stated at $2 on $1,000. The population, according to the census of 1880 is 1,264."], [245, "FRANKFORT. 237 FrailklOrt is situated on the western bank of the Penobscot River, in the north-eastern part of Waldo County. It is bounded on the north by Winterport, east by Bucksport, on the opposite side of the Penobscot, south by Prospect and Searsport, and west by Monroe. The town is about 7\u00a3 miles long, east and west, and 4h wide. The sur face is broken and rough. The soil is gravel in parts, in others loam. The principal crop is hay. There are several high hills, the highest of which, mounts Waldo and Mosquito, are in the south-eastern part of the town. The former is about 1,000 feet in height. It was formerly called mount Misery, from the sufferings connected with the death of two boys who ascended the mountain, and perished in the snow-storm by which they were overtaken. In 1815 a party of excursionists who ascended the mountain re-named it Mount Waldo. Mosquito Moun tain is an immense mass of granite, and is noted for the number of mosquitoes swarming about it from the stagnant marsh between its base and the river. Halley Hill is another elevation of land near the centre of the town. Each of these three eminences have granite quar ries near them, from which immense quantities of granite have been taken. The principal stream is Marsh River, the north branch of which, flowing from the west, forms a portion of the north-western boundary of the town ; and having formed a junction with the south branch, which bounds a small portion of the town on the east, empties into the Penobscot at Marsh Bay. On this stream are several powers, of which the first is occupied by mills. At this place is Marsh Village, 16 miles from both Bangor pud Belfast. The stream is the outlet of several ponds in the town adjoining at the west, and of Goose Pond at the south-western corner of the town. There are some charming nooks along Marsh River in the western part of the town. Frankfort has three companies engaged in quarrying granite, a saw, shingle and grist mill, etc. The buildings in the village, and through the rural parts of the town give indications of thrift. Maple and birch trees prevail in the forests ; and many of the former have in years past been set along the streets, to the beautifying of the town, and refreshment of the traveler. As originally incorporated in 1789, Frankfort embraced the whole territory along the western bank of the Penobscot from Belfast to Wheeler's mills, on Soadabscook Stream ; thus embracing also the present towns of Prospect, Winterport, Hampden, and parts of Bel fast, Searsport and Stockton. In 1793 this was divided into the three towns of Prospect, Frankfort and Hampden; the first being the long est settled, \u2014 retaining the records but not the name. Prospect then included Searsport and Stockton, and Frankfort, the present Winter port. The last was set off in 1860, when Frankfort acquired its pres ent boundaries. It is found that there were settlers in Frankfort as early as 1770, for in 1773 there were twelve families residing at Marsh Bay, one family at Oak Point, and one where the village now is. Among these first settlers were J. Treat, E. Grant, J. Kinnakum, J. Woodman, P. King, S. Kenny and E. Ide. According to a MS. letter of Joshua Treat, Esq., an early settler, \"the first settlers got their liv ing by hunting moose, beaver and muskrat, and by fishing in Penob scot River.\" There were conflicting claims of proprietors under the Waldo patent \u2014 to which this tract belonged. Thorndike & Company"], [246, "238 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. finally proved to be the owners, of this township, which they sold to settlers at $2 per acre. The war of 1812 was a serious injury to the town, both as to de velopment and losses of property in lumber and vessels by seizure, and from destruction of the coasting trade. Among later valued citizens we have the names of Adams and Ames B. Treat, George A. Pierce and John Wiswell. Frankfort sent 60 men to do battle for the LTnion in the war of the Rebellion. Ten of these were lost. The church-edi fice in the town belongs to the Congregationalists. Frankfort has eight public schoolhouses, valued, with their appurtenances, at $4,500. The value of estates in 1870 was $220,646. In 1880 it was $186,815. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 21 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,152. In 1880 it was 1,158. Frailklill, in Hancock County, is situated at the head of Taunton Bay, a prolongation of Frenchman's Bay. It is 11 miles from Ellsworth, on the Bangor and Cherryfleld stage-line. There are several ponds, whose streams furnish considerable water-power. It has nine lumber-mills, two grist-mills, a tannery and three granite quarries. The material wealth of the town is mainly in its water power and its granite. The granite is porphyritic, but splits well, and is handsome when hammered. Few in the town live exclusively by farming. The soil is coarse and rocky, but under good cultivation is fairly productive. It is better for grazing than for annual crops. Nearly one-third of the hay is cut on the salt marshes, whence it is raked, and boomed in as the tide flows. Cranberry culture has received some attention, with successful results. Franklin is said to have shipped more spars, railroad ties, and ship timber than any other town of its size in this or in Washington County. Franklin was originally plantation No. 9. It was incorporated in 1825, being named in honor of Dr. Franklin. It was first occupied by the French at Butler's Point. Moses Butler and Mr. Wentworth came in 1764, and are supposed to be the first English settlers. The next were Joseph Bragdon, Mr. Hardison, Mr. Hooper and Abram Donnell. On Butler's Point are apple trees upwards of one hundred years old. The town furnished 120 men to the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion, paying bounty to the amount of $12,280. The Methodists and Baptists each have a church in the town. Franklin has nine public school houses, and the school property is valued at $5,000. The valua tion of estates in 1870 was $168,348.\" In 1880 it was $178,220. The population in 170 was 1,042. In the census of 1880 it was 1,102. Franklill COUllty is situated in the western part of the State, its northern extremity bordering on Canada. Somerset County bounds it on the ea.st, Kennebec and Androscoggin on the south, and Oxford County on the west. The area is 1,600 square miles. The Saddle back and Mount Abraham range of mountains, continuing eastward on a line with the Rangeley Lakes, divides the county in two nearly equal portions and separates the Sandy River valley on the south from that of Dead River on the north. From the line of highlands that marks the boundary between it and Canada flow down the head waters of the Androscoggin and Kennebec. Mount Abraham, 3,387 feet in height, and Saddleback Mountain, about 4,000 feet, mark the middle portion"], [247, "FRANKLIN COUNTY. 239 of the county, and Blue Mountain, also about 4,000 in height, with its eastward range of hills, subdivides the southern section. The Andro scoggin River passes across a corner of Jay, the south-western town of the county, and the streams of towns on this side are generally tributary to this river. An interesting feature is the combination of scenery about one little valley of ten miles radius from the town of Farmington, embracing the bold features of mountain ranges, with the low, warm, fertile valley, having the geological features and botanical exuberance which are not often found except in extensive countries. The region in view from the Saddleback range is no less striking, for on the west and south-west lie the Rangeley and Richardson Lakes, partly in Franklin and partly in Oxford ; northward is the Dead River Valley with this tributary of the Kennebec winding peacefully through it. Clearings in many directions show dots of buildings and broad tracts of grass-land and cultivated field. Franklin County was the home of the Norridgewock tribe of the Abnaki nation of Indians. Their principal village was near where Sandy River enters the Kennebec. There was a village of these people at Farmington Falls ; another was at Chesterville Centre, on the Little Norridgewock. Though the tribe* removed to Canada before settlements were made in the county by white people, yet a few strag gling families seem to have made different points in Franklin their homes for many years later, having some intercourse with the hunters, trappers and early settlers. The first of these found on Sandy River the camp of one of these secluded aborigines named Pierpole. He assisted them with valuable information in regard to their new home ; but not receiving the sympathy that was desirable from his new neigh bors, and being Roman Catholic in religion, he migrated to Canada with his family, carrying with him the dead body of his child. By the reports of hunters, the existence of the \" Great Interval\" on Sandy River became known in certain quarters, creating a large degree of interest. In 1776, therefore, five enterprising yroung men from Topsham explored the region with a view to settlement. Their names were Stephen Titcomb, Robert Gower, James Ilejiry, Robert Alexander and James Macdonnel. They selected lots in the centre of the \"Great Interval,\" measuring them off with strings of basswood bark. No family, however, moved into the place till 1781. Mr. Titcomb, intend ing to become the first settler with a family in the place, started with them ami his household goods in the autumn of 1780, but was blocked up by snow at the last house on the route, situated in Readfield. When spring opened he went to his clearing and put in his crop ; then, returning for his family, he met Joseph Brown and Nathaniel Davis on the way with their families. Settlers soon followed from each State of New England, excepting, perhaps, Vermont. The first mill in the county was on Davis's Mill Stream, now called Temple Mill Stream, near the centre of Farmington. This was erected by the combined enterprise of the settlers, and put in operation in the autumn of the first year that families wintered in the place. Many Revolutionary soldiers were among the early settlers. Enoch Craig was one of these, and became the founder of one of the enterprising and substantial families of Franklin County. In 1789, he married Dorothy Sterling, of one of the leading pioneer families, they being obliged to make a journey to Hallowell in order to be legally united. Within ten years"], [248, "240 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. of the wintering of the first families in Farmington, the Sandy River Valley, through most of its extent had become the seat of a flourish ing community ; and this town alone contained 85 families. A railroad connecting with the Maine Central was opened to Farm ington in 1859; and in 1880, a narrow-guage railway was constructed from Farmington to Phillips. The county having until within a few years been without the facilities of communication necessary to the development of manufactures beyond the supply of some of its local wants, affords perhaps the best illustration that can be found in New England of the relative profits of exclusively agricultural investments in a region distant from large markets, owing none of its prosperity or WESTERN NOR.UAL SCHOOL, FARMINGTON. wealth to commerce, manufacturing or lumbering operations. Whpt, then, has agricultural industry, unassisted by any other enterprise or investment, done for a community of 17 towns in the interior of Maine ? The reply is \" It has for nearly a century supported in com parative affluence an average population of some 20,000.\" Just in proportion as grazing\u2014 that is, stock-growing\u2014 was made the main re liance and endeavor, their progress and prosperity have been conspicu ous. Rev. J. S.

A large business is also done in canning sweet corn. Noble orchards were early planted in the older towns of the county, but were mainly useful for cider and vinegar, or for home use in cooking. The new orchards are chiefly intended to produce apples suitable for eating in their natural state, and great quantities are every year exported to all the cities of the country, and some even to Europe. The first sermon preached in Franklin County was about 1783, by Rev. Mr. Emerson, at the log-house of Stephen Titcomb. A Methodist meeting-house was erected at Farmington Falls as early as 1800. The meeting-house at the Centre (now the court-house) was raised in 1803 ; and in a few years, spires began to rise in many parts of the county. Franklin has three flourishing agricultural societies, each with an enclosed park and buildings for the purposes of exhibition. The first printing-press was set up in Franklin County in 1832, and a paper called the \" Sandy River Yeoman,\" was published one year, then abandoned. In 1840, the \" Franklin Register \" was started at Farm ington, and, after four years, changed to the \" Chronicle,\" which has \u2014 though by different publishers \u2014 been sustained uninteruptedly ever since. In 1858 the \"Franklin Patriot\" was started, continuing through the war of the Rebellion,\u2014 a smart supporter of the opposition! side against the \" Chronicle.\" The \" Phillips Phonograph \" was started! in 1878. Franklin County is also notable for its educational privilegesy, chief of which are the Western Normal School, for training teachers,.. the Wendell Institute, and the \"Little Blue \" or Abbott Family Schoob for boys. The act establishing Franklin County was passed in 1838. It mow contains 19 towns and 11 plantations which are organized or have had an organization.

Franklin Plantation, in Oxford County, lies 14 miles north of Paris. Its size is about 5 miles long by 2^- wide. There is a con siderable mountain in the southern part, and three in the north-west ern. In the extreme north-western angle is Mount Zircon, somewhat noted for the mineral spring situated on its western slope in Milton Plantation. A stream in the southern part affords several small water powers, upon which are a shingle-mill and a saw-mill for long and short lumber. There are said to be valuable deposits of gold and silver about the mountains. 16"], [250, "242 GAZETTEER OF MAINE.

The plantation was organized in 1841. The only church is that of the Advents. The number of public schoolhouses is three, having a value of $300. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $35,487. In 1880 it was $26,110. The population in 1870 was 178. In 188C it was 159. Freedom lies on the western line of Waldo County, 18 miles W. N. W. of Belfast. It is bounded on the north by LTnity, east by Montville, south by Palermo, and west by Albion, in Kennebec County. The surface is uneven. The principal hills are Beaver and Sandford. The ponds are Sandy and Duck. Both are situated in the eastern part of the town, and supply Sand)- Stream, which runs northward through Freedom Village to Unity Pond. The area of Sandy Pond is abuut 850 acres, of Duck, 200 acres. On Sandy Stream near the village are five powers. On these are a flour-mill, a corn-mill, a saw-mill for long lumber, a shingle-mill, a shovel-handle factory, a carding, clothing and woollen mill, and a tannery. The village has several handsome resi dences, and the streets are pleasantly shaded with maple and elm trees. The nearest railroad station is that of the Belfast branch of the Maine Central at Thorndike. As an agricultural town Freedom ranks at about an average. The soil is chiefly gravelly loam. The chief crops are hay and potatoes. There is some ledge and many granite bowlders. The usual variety of trees are found in the forests, but these are mainly of the hard woods. Freedom was a part of the Plymouth Patent. The first opening was made in the forest in 1794 by Stephen Smith, a soldier of the .Revolution. With the assistance of his brothers, he also built the first house in the town in the latter part of the same year. It was located a short distance south of the burying-ground in South Freedom. The next June, John Smith, subsequently known as Father Nehemiah, set tled in the township. Then followed Rev. Aaron Gould, Isaac Worth ing and James and Joshua Smith. Other prominent names of a little later date are Jason Wood, Frost Gerry, Gideon Robinson, Colonel lirown, Benjamin Comings, Bradstreet Wiggins, William Sibley and Rev. Reuben Keen. Still later names of eminence are honorablcs Robert Elliott, J. D. Lawson, N. A. Luce, William Sibley, esquires; and of M.D.'s, Ithamer Bellows, Varney Blackstone and Aaron W. Gould. The plantation name was at first Smithstown, afterwards Beaver Hill. In 1813, during the last war with Great Britain, the town was incorporated under its present name, which was the choice of the inhabitants and had a political significance. The Congregationalists have the only church-edifice in the town. Freedom Academy was incorporated in 1836. It has furnished a part of their education to many who hare become prominent in their call ings. Freedom has nine public schoolhouses, valued, with their appur tenances, at $2,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $191,505. In 1880 it was $177,241. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 13\u00a3 mills on the dollar, cash tax. The population in 1870 was 716.

The middle and southern part of the town is drained by a branch of Sandy River, and across the northern part flows Curvo Stream, the southern branch of Seven Mile Brook. Freeman and West Freeman are the post-offices. There are saw-mills at Freeman, West and North Freeman. Freeman is the westerly of two townships granted by the State of Massachusetts to the sufferers of Falmouth (now Portland) in the burning of the town by the British during the Revolutionary War. It was surveyed and settled under the agency of Reuben Hill about 1797. William Brackly, David Hooper, Alexander Fasset, Samuel Wey mouth, and Messrs. Burbank, Morton and Boston were among the first settlers. The township was No. 3, in 2d Range, and when first settled took the name of Little River Plantation. It was incorporated in 1803, taking its name from Samuel Freeman, of Portland, who was one of the principal owners at the time of settlement. The Methodists have a church at Freeman Village, and the Free Baptists at West Freeman. There are ten public schoolhouses in the town, and the school property is valued at $2,400. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $146,090. In 1880 it was 140,269. The population in 1870 was 608. In 1880 it was 549. I reeport is situated in the eastern part of Cumberland County, and at the north-eastern extremity of Casco Bay. Brunswick bounds it on the east, Pownal on the north, the latter and Yarmouth on the west, and Casco Bay on the south. Cousin's River forms the dividing line between Freeport and Yarmouth for about half the dis- tance of their boundary. The Maine Central Railroad runs through the town, having a station at Freeport Corner, 17 miles from Portland. Other business centres are South Freeport, Mast Landing and Porter's Landing. The surface of the town is varied, with but moderate eleva- tions and depressions. The soil is chiefly clay loam, and generally productive. The largest crops are hay and potatoes. Harraseeket River is the principal stream. The long basin at its mouth constitutes a harbor navigable by large vessels, and its openness through the yrear is supposed to have given the town its name of Freeport. This harbor is formed by Wolf's and Mitchell's necks. Flying Point forms tho south-eastern angle of the town. There are upwards of a dozen islands within the corporate limits. The largest of these are Bustin's, Silver, Lanses, French, and Cab islands. The manufactures are ships and boats, shoes, clothing, harnesses, canned food, etc. The shipbuilding points are Mast Landing, Porter's Landing and South Freeport. Freeport Corner is a pleasant village, with elm-shaded streets and several elegant residences. Most of the houses have ample grounds, and some ornamental shrubbery. Orchards, with fine old as well as young trees, and choice fruit, are a feature of the village. The Pownal and South Freeport roads continue these attractions, and afford agreeable drives."], [252, "244 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. The town was formerly a part of North Yarmouth, but was set off and incorporated in 1789. It then included Pownal, which was set off in 1808. The name of its principal stream, Harraseekit, was formerly applied to the town. The first church in Freeport was formed Decem ber 21, 1789, by ten members dismissed from the first church, North Yarmouth, and the Rev. Alfred Johnson was ordained the following week. He was dismissed in 1805, being succeeded by Rev. Samuel Veazie, who died at the age of thirty years, of consumption, the night after he was carried from his burning house, February 6, 1809. Rev. Reuben Nason was his successor (1810-15). He came to the office of pastor from Gorham Academy. He is said to have been an excellent Christian man, yet with much of the Puritanic sternness. He was prompt to punish offences, yet quick to appreciate a joke. The boys of the academy once put a donkey in his place at the recitation. In stead of becoming enraged, he simply told them that he thought they had shown excellent taste in selecting a suitable instructor \u2014 \"a donkey to teach donkeys\" \u2014 and retired. This ended all their fun of that sort with him. Rev. John S. C. Abbott, the historian, also preached in Freeport for a time. There are now two Congregationalist churches, one of which is a very handsome edifice. The Methodists, Baptists and Free Baptists also have each a church. Freeport has an excellent high-school at the Corner. There are in the town seventeen public schoolhouses, valued at $25,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $912,053. The rate of taxation in 1880 was $1.17 on $100. The pop ulation in 1870 was 2,457. In the census of 1880 it was 2,279. FreilChville lies on the southern bank of the St. John River, in the north-eastern part of Aroostook County, 110 miles north-east of Houlton. It is on the stage-line from Van Buren to Fort Kent. For merly it was the plantation of Dionne, named for Father Dionne, who built there the first Catholic church \u2014 St. Luce. It was incorporated Feb. 23, 1869, under the name of Dickeyville, in honor of Hon. William Dickey, of Fort Kent. The name was changed Jan. 26, 1871, to indi cate the nationality of the inhabitants. The town is very irregular in form, lying on a south-eastern bend of the St. John. On the south-eastern side it rests on the northern end of Long Lake, the north-eastern of the Fish River Lakes. The principal streams are Dufour, Gagnon, Rosignol, Bourgoin, and Cyr brooks, all emptying into the St. John, and each having falls suitable for mills. Gagnon Brook has two-saw-mills and two grist-mills, and Cyr Brook a small saw-mill. There are other small saw-mills, a cloth dressing mill and a 6tarch-factory in the town. The soil is sandy on some streams, but there is much interval, and the fertility is general. The crops cultivated are chiefly buckwheat, oats, peas, wheat and potatoes. The most numerous forest trees are maple, cedar and fir. The Catholics have the only church in the town. Frenchville has twelve public schoolhouses; and the children of school age number 1,112. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $80,600. In 1880 it was $107,753. The rate of taxation in 1880 was \\\\ per cent. The number of polls in 1870 was 274. In 1880 the number was 375. The population in 1870 was given in the report massed with townships 16 and 17, Range 5, the aggregate being 1,851. In 1880, the same were given at 2,288."], [253, "FRYEBURG. 245 Friendship, the south- western town of Knox County, is situated at the north-west side of Muscongus Bay. On the north-west is Waldoboro, and on the east, Cushing. Friendship River forms the larger part of the boundary line on this side, and the outlet of South west Pond forms its entire line with Waldoboro. The greatest length of the town is from north-east to south-west. The area is about 8,000 acres of mainland, and Friendship Long Island, nearly 3 miles long, and Moses Island, about half as large, containing 85 acres. The surface of the town is very rough and ledgy, having but a thin layer of sand and alluvium. Friendship was a part of the Muscongus or Waldo patent, and the original deeds are from General Waldo. The Indian and the planta- tion name of the town was Meduncook, signifying \" Sandy Harbor.\" Yet the term seems inappropriate, for the shore is rock-bound, and in some parts are bold bluffs where ships may ride at anchor in safety in 20 feet of water. The first settlements were in 1750. About this date a garrison was erected on an island in the southern part ; which, from this circumstance, bears the name of Garrison Island. It is connected with the main at low water. James Bradford, who was one of the first inhabitants, settled near the fort. In 1754, there were resident here 22 families, among whom occur other names as follows : Jameson, Wads- worth, Davis, Lowry, Gay, Cushing, Bartlett, Demorse, Bickmore, Morton and Cook. In the war of 1755 all moved their families with- in the garrison except Bradford, who believed he could easily reach it whenever Indians should appear. One morning while he was engaged in pounding corn, the watchers in the garrison saw savages approach- ing the house, and at once fired a gun to alarm Bradford's family. None of them heard it, and the savages entered the house and killed Mr. Bradford and his wife with their tomahawks. As her infant fell from her arms, a daughter some twelve or fourteen years old, sprang from her concealment under the bed and caught the infant as it fell, instantly running away with it toward the garrison. The Indians pur- sued, flinging their tomahawks after her. One of these made a deep flesh wound, yet she reached the garrison still holding the infant. The girl recovered from her wound, and, removing to Vermont, became the mother of a large and respectable family. The manufactures are mostly at Friendship Village, and consist of ship and boat building, sail, carriage, boot and shoe making ; and there is one stave and shingle mill in operation. This place is 14 miles south- west of Rockland. It is on the stage-route from Thomaston to Friend- ship and thence to Waldoboro. There is a church of the Methodists, of the Baptists, and of the Advents in the town. The number of public schoolhouses is seven. The total school property is valued at $2,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $140,267. In 1880 it was $157,165. The population in 1870 was 890. In 1880 it was 938. Fryeburg is an old and interesting town in Oxford County, situated between Bridgton, in Cumberland County, and the New Hamp shire line. These are its eastern and western boundaries ; on the north lie Stowe, Lovell and Sweden, on the south-east is Denmark, and on the 6outh, Brownfield. As originally incorporated in 1777, the town was 2,172 rods square. A triangle of 4,147 acres was taken from"], [254, "246 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. its south-west corner, when the dividing line between Maine and New Hampshire was run ; and a tract was subsequently annexed to the north part, and another on the south \u2014 the latter taken from Brownfield. That on the north was known as Fryeburg Addition. It included the valley of Cold River, and in 1833 was set off and incorporated as Stowe. The extreme length of the town, north and south, is 12 miles, and the extreme width, east and west, about 7 miles. The surface is much varied with hills, plains, ponds and streams. The Saco River forms in the town an immense bow with its curve toward the north, absorbing 31 miles of its length. There is a connection with the sides of this bow through the middle of the town by means of a canal, pond and bog. The river receives the outlets of four large ponds and seve ral small ones, lying wholly or partially within the town. Of these, the largest are Lovell's (area, 2 square miles), Kezar and Kimball ponds, the first in the southern, the second in the eastern, and the latter in the north-western part of the town. Other ponds bear the names of Pleasant, Bog, Charles, Clay, Horseshoe, Cat, Round, Black, Haley and Davis. Kezar River is a considerable stream that comes in on the north-east \u2014 the outlet of ponds in Waterford and Sweden. Bog Pond lies in the centre of the town ; and between the south-eastern part and Saco River stands the solitary \" Mount Zion.\" Between the head of Lovell Pond and Saco River, on the west, lies Fryeburg Village ; and on the river, west of the village, is Pine Hill. The Port land and Ogdensburg Railroad approaches the village from the south east and turns away toward the south-west, passing between a southern bend of the Saco and Stark's Hill on the south. Stark's Hill is 500 feet in height, and is succeeded southward by Long Hill and Bald Peak. Three-fourths of a mile north-east of the village is Jockey Cap Hill, and a mile and a half north of this, on the eastern bank of the western brow of the Saco, is Martha's Grove Camp Ground. In the western part of the town, on the south-eastern shore of Kimball's Pond, is Birch Hill. On the north end of Lovell's Pond, on the eastern side, comes in Fight Brook, upon the meadow, at the mouth of which oc curred the famous Lovewell's Fight, from which the pond and brook take their names. North Fryeburg and Fryeburg Centre are small villages; and these, with another small village, Fryeburg Village and East Fryeburg are the post-offices ; Fryeburg Centre post-office is another. The principal water-powers of this town are on Kezar River, Ballard's and Evan's brooks, and at the beautiful Swan's Falls on the Saco River, within a mile of Fryeburg Village. The manufactures of the town consist of leather, harnesses, carriages, lumber in its various forms, tinware, cheese, canned vegetables, etc. There are four water mills, and two steam-mills. The Fryeburg intervals are noted for their richness and beauty, containing nearly $10,(00 acres which are annually overflowed and fertilized by the Saco. There is the usual variety of trees, with large tracts of pine and oak. Fryeburg, the principal centre of business in the town, is a pretty village on a broad level plain, slightly elevated above the intervals of the Saco. Many from the cities every summer find rest in its numerous hotels and boarding-houses. The place is in full view of the White Mountains. This town is celebrated for the fight to which allusion has already been made. Capt. John Lovewell, the son of an ensign in Cromwell's"], [255, "FRYEBURG. 247 Puritan army, was an able partisan officer of the colonies. In April, 1725, he led 46 men from the frontier Massachusetts towns by a long and arduous march into the heart of the Pequaket country. After marching over 100 miles they reached Saco (now Lovell's) Pond, with 34 men, and here they encamped over night near the chief village of the Indians. In the morning, Saturday, May 8, while they were assembled around the chaplain on the western side of the pond, and ere the morning devotions had been finished, a gun was heard, and an Indian was seen on the opposite side. They at once commenced a circuit of the northern end of the pond ; leaving their packs on a small plain among the brakes in the shade of tall pines, and continued on around the eastern side of the pond in search of the Indian. They soon met him returning to the village. Shots were exchanged and he fell. Meantime, a party of savages about three times as strong as Lovewell's, led by Paugus and Wahwa, had discovered the packs half hidden among the brakes. Paugus ordered his warriors to fire over the heads of the English, then make them prisoners. As Love well led his men back to the little plain by the brook, the savages rose before them, front and flank, and rushed toward them, presenting their guns and holding out ropes, and demanding if they would have quarter. \"Only at the muzzle of our guns \" replied the brave captain. The forces met with a volley, and several Indians fell. Three more rounds were fired at close quarters, and Lovewell was mortally wounded, and 8 of his men were killed. The English retired, fighting,to a position among the pines with the pond in their rear, Fight Brook on one side and Rocky Point on the other. This sheltered position they main tained for eight hours against continued assaults ; and at sunset the Indians retired, leaving 39 of their warriors killed and wounded, in cluding Paugus. The fight had continued so long that some of their guns became foul with so much firing, and John Chamberlain went down to the water to wash his piece. Just then a warrior, supposed to be Paugus, came down for the same purpose, only a short distance off. They watched each other's movements, and finished the cleaning at the same time, then commenced to load. \" Quick me kill you now,\" exclaimed the Indian. \"Maybe not,\" answered Chamberlain, thumping the breech of his gun heavily on the ground. His old flintlock primed itself, and a mo ment later his bullet crashed through the brain of the huge savage, whose bullet whistled harmlessly through the air. Throughout the long day, the yells of the Indians, the cheers of the English, and the reports of the muskets resounded through the forests ; while chaplain Frye, mortally wounded, was often heard praying for victory. About midnight the English retreated, leaving 15 of their number dead and dying on the field, while 10 of the remaining 19 were wounded. This battle broke the strength of the Pequakets and filled the neighboring clans with fear; so that most of them removed to Canada. The larger part of Fryeburg was granted by Massachusetts in 1762 to General Joseph Frye, who had been at the siege of Louisburg, and commanded a regiment at Fort William Henry, on Lake George, in 1757. In the same year a grant was made to some persons in Concord, N.H., who came with their cattle and commenced clearings, and the next year (1763) came in with their families. Of these, Nathaniel Smith with his family were the first settlers, followed in November by"], [256, "GAZETEEER OF MAINE. 248 Samuel Osgood, Moses Ames, John Evans, and Jedediah Spring, with their familtes. In 1766, Lieut. Caleb Swan and his brother James came in. The year 1766 was a period of great suffering from lack of food, and the settlers were obliged to send men to Concord, 80 miles through the wilderness with handsleds, for provisions. A Congregational church was organized in 1775, and Rev. William Fessenden ordained as pastor. He was the ancestor of the noted family of his name. Fryeburg Academy was incorporated in 1792, and has ever maintained high rank. Paul Langdon, son of the presi sident of Harvard University, was the first preceptor. He was suc ceeded in 1801 by Daniel Webster, then \" a youth unknown to fame.\" The new building was erected in 1806. The first lawyer in Fryeburg, and in what is now Oxford County, was Judah Dana, who came to Fryeburg in 1798. The town was first represented in the General Court in 1781, by Simon Frye, many years a senator and judge of the Court of Common Pleas. Fryeburg has now a Congregational, a Methodist and a New Jeru salem church. It has sixteen schoolhoui-es, valued at $6,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $670,383. In 1880 it was $796,322. The population in 1870 was 1,507. In 1880 it was 1,633. Gardiner, in the southern part of Kennebec County, is situated on the western bank of the Kennebec River about 25 miles from the sea. The Kennebec separates it from Pittston on the east, and the Cobbossee Contee Stream, on the opposite side divides it from West Gardiner. Farmingdale forms the northern boundary, and Rich mond the southern. The other principal stream is Rolling-dam Brook. The form of the town is nearly triangular, the side on the river being about 6 miles in length, and the width of the southern side about 4 miles. Ward 6, in the southern part comprises two-thirds of the ter ritory. On the river in this ward is the village of South Gardiner, where there are the large lumber-mills of Bradstreet Brothers and Lawrence Brothers. The city proper is at the northern extremity of the territory, where the Cobbosee Contee Stream enters the Kennebec. On this stream within one mile of its mouth is a descent of 127 feet to high tide in the river, included in 8 falls or rapids. Six of these priv ileges are improved by well-built sione dams, and are occupied by five saw-mills, one employing 25 hands and two about 40 hands each;, two sash, blind a^d door factories, cabinet, water-wheel, and fancy wood work factories ; a plaster-mill, two grain-mills \u2014 each consuming about 40,000 bushels annually \u2014 two machine-shops \u2014 one with foundry, the latter employing about 28 hands \u2014 three mill-wright shops, woolen factory, employing 40 hands, washing-machine factory, carriage-spring factory, axe-factory, Copsecook paper-mill, employing 38 hands, and Richards' paper-mill, employing 75 hands. The total annual product of these various factories is estimated to be $2,000,000. The rural portion of the town is a thrifty agricultural region, while along the river, the inhabitants are largely engaged in the ice business, which yields an annual return almost equal to that of the manufac tures. The Maine Central Railroad runs through the length of the town along the river. The city proper is at the head of steam naviga tion on the river, and through it is connected by a line of boats with Boston."], [257, "GARDINER. 249 Gardiner was formerly a part of Pittston, and the earlier part of its history will be found involved with that of the latter town. The separation took place at the incorporation of Pittston in 1804, when that part of the territory west of the Kennebec, now Gardiner, took the name of the Cobbossee Plantation. It was mostly owned by Dr. Sylvester Gardiner, of Boston, but later, for a long period the resident agent of the Plymouth Proprietors on the Kenne bec. He erected a saw-mill on the Cobbossee Contee Stream in 1760, and thus began the settlement of the place. His grandson, Robert Hallowell Gardiner, came into possession of the property in 1803, when the territory was incorporated as a town under its present name in honor of its founder. The number of inhabitants at that time was 650. It received a city charter in 1850 ; soon after this what is now West Gardiner was set off and formed into a separate town. Cobbossee contee fall, gaudh^er, me. Gardiner has one savings and two national banks. The Gardiner \" Home Journal,\" a lively sheet, independent in politics, is published here weekly, by H. K. Morrell & Son. The other sheet is the popular \" Kennebec Reporter,\" published by R. B. Caldwell & Co. It is local in its aims. Each of the leading religious denominations has a church here ; the large stone church of the Episcopal society being the most interesting. There is a fine soldier's monument in the park nearly op posite the church. There is a good corporation library, and steps have been taken for the creation of a free public library. The city proper has a complete system of graded schools. There are in all fourteen public schoolhouses, valued at $38,000. The valuation in 1870 was $2,179,243. In 1880 it was $2,379,129.

Garland is 25 miles north-west of Bangor. It is bounded by Charleston on the east, Dexter on the west, Exeter on the south, and Dover, in Piscataquis County, on the north. The town is 6 miles square. The southern portion, embracing more than half of the area, is quite level, not very stony, and very good for culture. The rock is argillaceous slate. The northern part is traversed, east and west, by a high range of hills. These are intersected near the medial line of the town by a deep ravine known as \" The Notch,\" through which runs a county road to Dover. The Kenduskeag originates in Pleasant Pond, which extends its length across the southern part of the line between Garland and Dexter. At the east end, on the outlet of this pond, is the village of West Garland. On the same stream, and reaching to Garland village a little south of the centre of the town, is the long \" Mill Pond.\" At the south-east corner of the town the Kenduskeag again furnishes a power at the little village of Holt's Mills. The manufactures of this town consist of boots and shoes, long aud short lumber (four mills), doors, sash, etc., meal and flour (two mills), wool rolls, carriages, furniture, egg-cases, etc. The stage-line from Exeter to Dexter passes through the town, connecting with the Maine Central Railroad at the latter place. The exterior lines of Garland were run in 1792 by Ephraim Bal lard and Samuel Weston. In 1796 Massachusetts granted to Williams College two townships of land, of which Garland was selected as one. The trustees of the college, in 1798, conveyed it to Levi Lincoln, Seth Hastings, Samuel and Calvin Sanger, Samuel Sanger, Jr., and Elias Grout. The township took the name of Lincoln, from the first mentioned proprietor, who later (1808) was governor of Massachusetts. In 1800, Moses Hodsdon, assisted by Daniel Wilkins, David A. Gove and a Mr. Shores, ran the lines between a large number of lots. Again in 1805 A. Strong surveyed an additional number. Messrs. Gove and Wheeler were the first who selected their lots. Joseph Garland, from Salisbury, N. H., with his wife and three children were the first family here ; wherefore at its incorporation in 1811, his name was given to the town. There were at this time about fifty legal voters within its limits. In 1802 a saw-mill was built by the proprietors of the township, and in the following year several frame buildings were erected. The first school was held in the house of William Garland in 1806, and taught by William Mitchell. A post-office was established in 1818. Rev. John Sawyer gathered the first church here. The town now has three \u2014 Congregationalist, Baptist and Methodist. Garland has eleven public schoolhouses valued at $4,050. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $312,263. In 1880 it was $331,690. The population in 1870 was 1,306. In 1880 it was $1,211. GeOrge'S Corners, a small village in Holden, Penobscot County. Georgetown is an island and a town. It forms the south eastern part of Sagadahoc County, lying between Sheepscot River and"], [259, "GILEAD. 251 the mouth of the Kennebec. Westportand Woolwich lie on the north, Arrowsie and Phipsburg on the west. Its length, north and south, is about 9 miles, and its average width nearly 2 miles. The long narrow harbor called \" Robinhood's Cove,\" penetrates the island from the north past the middle of the island. The principal settlement known as Georgetown Centre, is near the head' of this cove. Sagadahoc Bay penetrates the island about one and half a miles in the opposite di rection. Seal Cove is on the west of this bay. On the eastern side of the island are Herman's Harbor and Five-Island Harbor, each having a small settlement. Back River, having some current from the Kenne bec, separates Georgetown from Arrowsie. At the north-east is a narrow passage between the shore and some islands called Little Hurl gate. McMahan's and the Five Islands lie on the Sheepscot side, Stage and Salter's Islands on the ocean, and Long and Man's Islands in Kennebec River. There is considerable salt marsh in the southern and the north-western part of the town. There are four small ponds on the island, and in the south-east, Great Pond, lying near the shore, has a wide connection with the sea. There are several excellent tide-powers, one of which at the centre is improved, where there is a saw, shingle and grist mill. There is also a carding and shingle mill on the outlet to Nichol's Pond. This village is connected with Bath by a stage-line. Its nearest railroad station is Nequasset, in Woolwich. Georgetown is also in the course of the steamboat-line between Bath and Booth bay. Perhaps one half the territory of the town is good for tillage and grazing. The inhabitants are largely engaged in the fisheries and in the merchant service. The town formerly embraced the several islands at the mouth of the Kennebec, together with what are now the towns of Phipsburg, Bath, West Bath, Woolwich and Arrowsie. It includes now only one island, formerly called Parker's Island. This was purchased of the natives in 1650 by one John Parker, who was the first occupant after 1668. Yet it has been thought by some that a portion of Popham's Colony formed a settlement here. The island is at present held under Parker's title, some of his posterity still being residents and land proprietors. The Indian name of the island was Rascohegan, with various spellings. The southern part is the locality known to early voyagers as Sagada- hoc. The first Indian war swept away whatever inhabitants there were, and no permanent re-settlement was made until about 1730. It was included in the incorporation of 1716. The post-offices are at the Centre and North Georgetown. Each of these places, and the harbor on the east have a church. The Centre and Harbor have Free Baptist churches, and North, a Methodist. Georgetown has nine public schoolhouses, valued with the lots at $2,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $168,500. In 1880 it was $147,824. The population in 1870 was 1,135. In 1880 it. was 1,080. Gilead lies on the western border of Oxford County, and re ceives the Androscoggin River from New Hampshire. It has Riley on the north, Bethel on the east, Fryburg Academy and Batchelder's Grants on the south. The length of the town, east and west, is about 6\u00a3 miles, and the width 2f. The town is nearly filled with hills and mountains, only the north-eastern and north-western corners and some"], [260, "252 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. tracts along the streams being level land. On the north side of the town is a row of three mountains, and on the south are six. From west to east, through the middle of the town, flows the Androscoggin, between these two rows of mountains. Their height varies from 400 to 600 feet. The principal ones are Robinson's Peak, Tumble Down Dick, Peaked Hill and Mount Ephraim. Between Mount Ephraim and Gilead village on the east of it, Wild River comes down from the region of mountains at the southward to the calmer Androscoggin. The water-powers which have been improved are on Pleasant and Chapman's brooks. The mills are a lumber-mill, a grist-mill, and one manufacturing spool-stock, boxes and staves. The Grand Trunk Rail way runs through the length of the town on the south bank of the Androscoggin. rlihe soil is chiefly loam and gravel. The chief crop is hay, which finds a good market with the lumbermen, who make this a starting point for the woods. The currents of air between the mountains are such as in a great measure to protect the crops of the valleys and slopes from the frosts of autumn. This town is 35 miles W.N.W. of Paris. The railroad station is 80 miles from Portland. Gilead has a wooden bridge 300 feet in length aud a wire bridge of 192 feet. Gilead was incorporated in 1805, its name being suggested by a large balm of gilead tree not long since still standing in the midst of the town. It was formerly called Peabody's Patent. In 1781 the only two fami lies in town were killed by the Indians. During the the terrible storm of 1826, when occurred the slide in the White Mountains which destroyed the Willey family, there were many slides on the mountains in Gilead. From Peaked Hill thousands of tons of earth and rocks with trees came rushing down, destroying every living thing in their course. Through the intense darkness, gleamed the lightning and the long streams of fire caused by the sliding rocks. Among these mountains bears are still to be found, and the early annals of the town are full of thrilling adventures with these beasts.

Gleilbliril is situated in the southern part of Penobscot County, and adjoins Bangor on the south. It is bounded on the east by Orono and Oldtown, north by Hudson, and west by Kenduskeag and Levant. Pushaw Lake lies on the eastern line, and the Kendus keag River crosses the south-western part of the town. The surface is generally level, and the soil fertile. The town is chiefly agricultural, and the inhabitants take pride in their occupation and its results. There are some good water-powers on the Kenduskeag, and on Black Branch and Lancaster Brook. Pushaw Lake contains eight square miles. The manufactures are chiefly flour-barrel hoops, moccasins and charcoal. The stage-lines from Bangor to North Bradford and Corinth run through the town. This place was first incorporated Jan. 29, 1822, under the name of Dutton, in honor of Judge Dutton, of Bangor. The name was changed"], [261, "GORHAM. 253 in March 18, 1837, to that borne at present.

On the south-east is Westbrook, on the south Scarborough, on the north-west Standish, and on the south-west Buxton, in York County. The Oxford and Cumberland Canal passes through the town nearly parallel to the Pre- sumpscot River from Casco Bay to Sebago. Stroudwater Pond and River drain the southern part of the town, and Little River drains the centre. The Portland and Rochester Railway crosses the southern part of the town, having a station at Gorham Village ; and the Port- land and Ogdensburgh crosses the northern part, having a station at White Rock, and at Gambo Falls, in Windham, adjoining. Gorham village, Little Falls, Great Falls and West Gorham are the principal business centres. There are numerous manufactures in town and at its borders. At Gorham village are a tannery, a carpet, clothing and carriage factories, granite and marble works, saw and grist mills, a canned-food and a corn-canning factory, etc. At Little Falls (South Windham P. O.) is a saw-mill and a brick-yard ; at Mallison Falls, half a mile below, are a saw and a grist-mill. In North Gorham are a cloth ing factory, box and shook, and long and short lumber mills, a wagon and sleigh factory, a paper-pulp and ware-mill, etc. There are small mills on Little River and at Parker's Corners ; at Great Falls are a saw-mill, barrel-factory, chair-factory, and a grist and plaster-mill. Other localities are South Gorham and Gambo Falls. The Gorham Savings Bank at the close of the year 1879 held in deposits and profits $133,633. Gorham was one of the seven townships granted in 1728 to"], [262, "254 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. the men (or their heirs) who bore arms in the Narraganset war, in 1675. The first clearings were made by Captain John Phinney, of Plymouth blood, who with his boy paddled up Presumpscot River and fixed upon Fort Hill for his home. There were Indians living in wigwams near by, but for two years this was the only white family in the township. The oldest daughter aided in the transportation of provisions to and from Portland, rowing a boat and carrying the bags of corn and meal around the falls. Messrs. Bryant, Cloutman, Read and McLellan followed a year or more later. They early built a block-house ; but in 1746 Bry ant was killed in his field, his house was assailed, five of his children were killed and scalped, and the mother taken captive and carried awayrto Canada. The township was at first called Narragansett No. 7, but was later changed to Gorhamtown, in honor of Captain John Gor ham, one of the early inhabitants. The township was surveyed in 1762, and incorporated as Gorham in 1764. In 1780 appeared here a sect called New Lights, who protested against congregational taxation, ministerial education, and other established customs. The Freewill Baptists, Methodists, Friends and Shakers also formed societies here about this time. When there were only thirteen families in town the first meeting-house was built, the material being logs. Rev. Benjamin Crocker, from Ispwich, and a graduate of Harvard College, was. set tled as first minister in 1743. In 1750, Rev. Solomon Lombard was ordained pastor of the church which had been organized that year. In 1803 Gorham Academy was incorporated, and many of its pupils have become distinguished in the professions and public affairs. It was a few years since changed into the Western Normal School ; and by an appropriation from the State, and generous gifts from the citizens, a new building was erected, and the former one improved. The scenery of Gorham is quite varied, and there are some com manding views, especially that from Fort Hill. The flow of the river and streams is remarkably equable ; and the natural advantages of good soil and water-power and the nearness of market render this a favorable field for manufacturer and farmer. Hon. Hugh D. McLellan was for many years the historic authority of the place. It was the wife of an ancestor of his of the same name, who, \" when the savages attacked the little settlement in the absence of the men, gathered the women into the garrison, mounted the walls, and by pluck and powder won a brilliant victory over the Indians,\" and held them in check till their lords returned. Hon. Stephen Long fellow, LL.D., was a native of Gorham, where he was born in 1776. He practised law in Portland, and was sent to Congress in 1822. He died in 1849. His wife was the daughter of Gen. Peleg Wadsworth, an officer of the Revolution. Their eldest surviving son is the poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The distinguished Sargeant S. Prentiss, was educated at Gorham Academy. Gorham Village forms a convenient and agreeable suburb for the neighboring City of Portland. Its dwellings here and there show marks of the ancient time ; but the place has a thrifty look, the dwell ings in general have ample grounds, and there are several elegant residences. One Congregational church, two Methodist churches and two Free Baptist, afford opportunity for moral and religious instruction. Gorham has nineteen public schoolhouses, valued at $12,400. The valuation of"], [263, "GRAFTON. 255 estates in 1870 was $1,445,968. In 1880 it was $1,398,524. The population at the same date was 3,351. The census of 1880 sets it at 3,233. GOllldSborOUgTl occupies the south-eastern extremity of Hancock County, lying between Frenchman's and Gouldsborough bays. The town also embraces Stave, Ironbound, Porcupine, Horn's, Turtle and Schoodic islands. Gouldsborough is 21 miles east of Ells- worth, and is on the Shore stage-line. The area is about 30,000 acres. Forbes's and Jones's ponds are the chief bodies of water. The principal eminence is Mount Cromer, 600 feet in height. The surface of the town is much broken, abounding in rocky bluffs consisting of granite penetrated by veins of galena, zinc and copper. There is also green- stone and syenite. At Grindstone Point is an immense deposit of metamorphic or siliceous slate, which might prove excellent material for grindstones. The soil is clay loam and gravelly loam; but one-third of the area is unsuitable for cultivation. The principal crops consist of wheat and potatoes. The manufactories consist of a flour-mill, two grist-mills, a shingle, and a spool-lumber mill, a saw-mill, and a lobster-canning establishment. There are alsosix incorporated mining companies, and two unincorporated, but in operation. TJie ore mined is principally galena, mixed with sulphurets of copper and iron. The centres of business are Gouldsborough village, West and South Gouldsborough, Winter and Prospect harbors. There were squatters in the town as early as 1700. On Ash's Point are the relics of an old French fortification. The so called Indian dykes are also objects of curiosity. The first settlers were from Saco and vicinity. Their names were Libby, Fernald, Ash andWilley. The first male child was Robert Ash, and the first female Mary Libby. An old inhabitant says: \"Nathan Jones and Thomas Hill settled here in 1764.\" Maj. Gen. David Cobb, one of General Washington's aids, and later, judge of the Court of Common Pleas, of Hancock County, resided here for many years. Gouldsborough was incorporated in 1789 ; being named in honor of Robert Gould, one of the original proprietors. That part of No. 7 known as \"West Bay Stream,\" was annexed in 1870. The town furnished 167 men to the Government during the war of the Rebellion. The amount of town bounty was $27,460. There are 12 persons in Gouldsborough who are over eighty years of age. The town has two churches, both Union. There are twelve public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $6,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $224,690. In 1880 it was $225,244.

It is bounded by Upton on the north, Kiley on the south, Newry on the south-west, and New Hampshire on the west. The area is about 45 square miles. A tract upon Cambridge River and its branches in the north-eastern part of the town, and about Bear River and its tributary brooks in the south-eastern part, are compara tively level ; but the western half and a belt across to the eastern side"], [264, "256 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. are full of mountains and high hills. Bear River White Cap, on the eastern border, and Speckled Mountain, south of the centre of the town, are the highest peaks. The passage made by Bear River through these mountains is known as Grafton Notch. A curiosity of this pass is Moon Cave. On the river below the notch are Mother Walker's Falls and the noted Screw Augur Falls. The business of the town is farming and lumbering. The soil in general is fertile, while the northern part is well timbered with pine and spruce. Grafton was first settled in 1830 by William Reed, Jesse Smith, Abraham It. York, Stephen Emery, and James Brown. In 1840 the settlers organized under the name of Holmes Plantation. In 1852 it was incorporated as a town under the present name. The town has a comfortable schoolhouse, valued at $100. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $26,675. In 1880 it was $25,857. The population in 1870 was 94. In 1880 it was 115. Grand Isle, in Aroostook County, lies on the north-eastern border of Maine. It is bounded on the west by Madawaska, on the east by Van Buren Plantation, and on the north-east the St. John's River separates it from St. Leonard, in New Brunswick. The town is 90 miles north of Houlton ; and is on the stage-line from Van Buren to Fort Kent. A long hill near the centre of the town, about 500 feet in height, is the principal eminence. West of it lies Levasseur's Pond, the largest in the township. Green River, in New Brunswick, enters the St. John opposite the northern part of the town. The New Bruns wick Railway runs along the opposite side of the river. The town has a saw, grist, and carding mills, and two or more starch-factories. The soil is generally fertile, and yields well of potatoes, wheat, buckwheat and oats, which the inhabitants are generally engaged in cultivating. Grand Isle was incorporated in 1869. It was named from an island in the river belonging to the town. The first settlers were Acadian French. The Roman Catholics have, at present, the only church. Grand Isle has six public schoolhouses. The school property is valued at $850. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $40,865. In 1880 it was $80,014. The amount assessed in the latter year was $1,384.26. The population in 1870 was 688. In 1880 it was 847. Graild Lake Stream Plantation is situated in the in- terior of Washington County on the stream connecting Grand Lake with Big Lake. This place is the terminus of the stage-line from Princeton on the European and North American Railway. It is also the terminus of the steamboat-lines through Lewey, Long and Big lakes from Princeton, and through Grand and Pocamsus lakes to the fish-hatching establishment of G. L. F. Ball, at Sysladobsis Lake Stream. The well-known salmon-trout establishment of Charles G. Atkins, Esq., is in this plantation on Grand Lake Stream. The manu factories consist of the saw-mill and tannery of F. Shaw & Brothers. The Hinckley township, which contains a portion of this stream, has a population of 345. The other portion of the stream is in township No. 27, of the Bingham Purchase. It has a mill and some settlers, but the population has not been given separately in any census report yet issued. The plantation is also the post-office name."], [265, "GRA r. 257 Grand Isle, a post-office in Aroostook County. Gray is situated near the middle of Cumberland County and 16 miles north of Portland. The Maine Central Railway passes through the eastern part of the town, about two miles from the village of Gray Corner. The bounding towns are New Gloucester on the north-west, North Yarmouth and Cumberland on the south-east, Wind ham on the south-west, and Raymond on the north-west. The larger part of Little Sebago Pond lies along the north-western side of the town, and in the north-eastern part is the small body of water called \" Dry Pond.\" The town is regular in its form, being nearly square. It is about 12 miles long by 10 wide. Gray Corner, near the centre of the town, is the largest village. It is situated on elevated plains surrounded by hills. The location is remarkably healthy ; and \u2014 as might be supposed \u2014 there are many aged people living in the town. The soil is chiefly a clayey or sandy loam, and fairly productive. There are many farms under superior cultivation. Granite is the prevailing rock, and is quarried to some extent. The larger manu factures are at Dry Milis and North Gray. They consist of the Fal mouth Mills, at the latter place, manufacturing repellants, one grain mill, twelve saw-mills (one of which is driven by steam), in different parts of the town, manufacturing lumber into its various forms for use. There are also a tannery, several manufactories of granite and marble, marbleized slate, horse-blankets, carriages and sleighs, patent shuttles, etc. The territory of Gray was granted to certain inhabitants of Boston in 1735, upon petition to the General Court representing that they had large families and were in straitened circumstances. The first settler, or one of the first settlers, was Moses Twitchell, who came from West boro, Mass., Jabez Matthews and William Webster followed soon after ; and in the course of fifteen or twenty years several other fam ilies moved in. The Indians once made a descent upon the settlement and destroyed the cattle, the meeting-house and all the dwelling houses, obliging the inhabitants to fly to other towns. After peace was restored they returned, erecting a new meeting-house, and build ing a block-house 50 feet long and 25 feet wide, around which they erected a garrison 100 feet long and 75 wide. There were rumors of intended attack by the Indians, out they were not further molested. The township had been without a name until about. 1756, when it began to be called New Boston. In 1778, it was incorporated under the name of Gray, in honor, it is supposed, of Thomas Gray, one of the proprietors. The town furnished men and supplies for the army in the Revolutionary war, and Moses Twitchell, the first settler, died in the public service in Canada. The first lawyer cf the town was Simon Greenleaf, who will be remembered as among the first of American jurists. The Congregationalists, Baptists and Methodists, each have a church-edifice ; and the Universalist society worships in the town-hall, which is an excellent two-story building of brick. The Pennell Institute is intended to serve as a high-school for the town. Gray has twelve public schoolhouses, valued at an aggregate of $6,000. The\" valuation of estates in 1870 was $480,780. In s880 it was $572, 122. The rate of taxation in 1880 is 13-^ mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,768. The census of 1880 places it at 1,798. 17"], [266, "258 GAZETTEER OF MAINE.

Olamon Stream, passing through the town from south-east to north-west, is the principal stream. The surface of the town is somewhat varied, and the soil has the average fertility. The village, at the north-western part of the town, at the mouth of the Olamon, is a pleasant and thriving place. Its manufactures consist of moccasins and snow-shoes, lumber, axes and cooper's ware. The European and North American Railroad runs through the town along the Penobscot. Greenbush was incorporated February 28, 1834.

Leeds bounds it on the north, Wales on the east, and Lewiston on the south. It contains 15,905 acres of land. The principal bodies of water are Allen, Deane, Little Sabattus and Berry ; and Sabattus Pond forms the southern half of the eastern boundary. Allen Pond, the largest within the town, is about one mile in diameter. The chief business centres are Greene Village and Greene Corner. The principal manufactures are of a carriage-factory, and of a grist, saw and excelsior mill, known as Sprague's Mills. The principal occupation is agricultural. The soil is well adapted to grazing, and the chief crops are hay and apples. The Maine Central Railroad bisects the town, having a station at Greene Village, a little east of the centre. The surface of the town is a little more elevated, and more broken than the towns to the east and south. The hills in the north-western pirt are quite high. The \u2022principal of these are Clark's and Ames's mountains and Caswell Hill. Those southward are lower, the highest being Hill's Rid^e, in the south-eastern part. There are very few pine-trees in town, but other Maine woods are abundant. This territory was first known as a part of Lewiston Plantation, then as Littlesborough, from Moses Little, of Newbury, Massachusetts, who was a large proprietor in the Pejepscot Patent, which covered"], [267, "GREENFIELD. 259 a portion of it. He is said to have made a large purchase from the Indians of land in this vicinity. In 1788 it was organized under the present name in honor of General Greene, of Revolutionary fame. Benjamin Merrill was the first man who became a permanent set tler. He came from North Yarmouth in November 15, 1775, bringing his family and goods in an ox-cart. The snow lay a foot deep upon the ground, and was still falling when they moved into their log-house. Captain John Daggett, who settled in 1786, taught the first school in town the same year. He was also the first military officer whom the town could boast. Colonel William Sprague moved in from Medford, Mass., in 1779. He built the first mills in town, and excelled as a military tactitian. John Mower, another of the early esteemed citizens, removed from Charlton, Mass., in 1786. Luther Robbins came to Greene from Hanover, Mass., about 1788. He was the first representative to the Legislature. Captain Daggett, after teaching school three years, was succeeded by Elisha Sylvester, \u2014 who was noted for a facility of rhyming. The following specimen was in spired by a conversation with a predestinarian clergyman : \" If all things succeed, that's already decreed, And immutable impulses rule us, Then to preach and to pray is but time thrown away, And our teachers do nothing but fool us. And if by hard fate, we're driven this way or that, As the carman with whip drives his horses, Then none need to stray, but go on the right way Like the stars that are bound in their courses. But if by free-will we go, or stand still, As best suits the present occasion, Then fill up the bowl, and count him a fool That preaches up predestination.\" After the Revolution several soldiers came and made their home in Greene. Their names as far as has been ascertained are as follows : Captain John Daggett and Colonel William Sprague and Luther Rob bins, Esq., previously mentioned ; Colonel Jabez Bates, Captain Ichabod Philips, Jarius Phillips, John Mower, Samuel Mower, Thomas More, George Berry, John Allen, Joseph McKenney, Ezekiel Hackett, Benjamin Quimby and Benjamin Alden. In the war of 1812, 19 from the town enlisted in the national army, of whom 5 died in the service. In the war of the Rebellion, the report of the adjutant-general gives the town credit for 159 men. There was no cemetery until 1805, when four were laid out in dif ferent parts of the town. A Baptist Church, organized in 1793, was the first religious society. A church edifice was built soon after. Another was built at the centre in 1826, and one by the Universalists at about the same time. There are now in town, one Baptist, one Free Baptist, and a Universalist society.

Greeil'S Landing\", a post-office in Deer Isle, Hancock County. GreeilVale Plantation, in the western part of Frank lin County, lies between Sandy River and Dallas plantations. On the east is Madrid, and the north-west corner touches Rangely. The head of RangeleyLake intrudes slightly upon the western border of the town ; and it is here that the settlers are clustered. This point is 35 miles from Farmington ; and is the landing-place of the steamer that navigates the lake. This is the point where the tourists by way of Farmington strike the lake region. Just over the border of the town ship in Dallas rises Saddleback Mountain, said to be 4,000 feet in height. Along the southern border of Greenvale, and northward to the north-west corner of the town, runs a range of high hills. Across the north-western part of the township runs the outlet of the pond on Saddleback Mountain, emptying into Rangely Lake. The road from the head of the lake to Phillips and Farmington winds along southward of this range to the Sandy River Ponds, thence down the river. This plantation has a post-office, and one schoolhouse. The school property is valued at $160. The valuation in 1880 was $13,851. The population in 1880 was 50 persons. GreeilVillC is situated at the southern extremity of Moose head Lake, in the western part of Piscataquis County. It is the start ing point and base of supplies for lumberers, explorers, fishing parties, hunters and tourists. The township was a public grant to Thornton Academy, Saco, which received the south half from Massachusetts, and to Saco Free Bridge, which had the northern half at a later date from the State of Maine. Nathaniel Haskell, of Westbrook, who was the first settler, purchased the Academy Grant, on which there was some very good farming land, and commenced its settlement, moving his family into a completed house in 1827. Wilson's Pond lies within the town, and Wilson's Stream, which forms its outlet, has several beautiful cascades, and some very good mill-privileges. The surface of the town is quite hilly. The highest eminences are Indian Hill and Simpson Hill, which afford beautiful views of the lake and mountains of Somerset and Franklin Counties. The bed-rock crops out in numer ous places. The soil is a yellow loam in most parts, but the northern portion still has considerable timber. The trees include the usual varieties found in Central Maine. In 1829 the Messrs. Varney, two"], [269, "GREENWOOD. 261 brothers from Windham, built a saw-mill on Wilson's Stream, and the next year Mr. Haskell, aforementioned, put in a small grist-mill. With Mr. Haskell was associated Oliver Young ; and William Cummings, Isaac Sawyer, Mr. Shaw and Mr. Tufts were the next comers. A few years later came Samuel Cole ; in 1831, Edmund Scammon ; and John Gerrish soon after. Samuel Cole and Isaac Whitcomb built a saw-mill on Eagle Stream in 1832; and Mr. Cole, at a later date, put one up on Bog Stream. Mr. Hogan put a small steamboat for towing logs upon the lake in 1836. Others for passengers have since been added. Henry Gowermade the first clearing on the site of Greenville village in 1835, on the spot where the Lake House now stands. Mr. Gower was also the first to open a store in town, which was done in 1836. The township was organized as Haskell's Plantation in 1831 ; and in 1836 it was incorporated as the town of Greenville. In 1846 the Eveleth House was built ; in 1858 the first meeting-house was put up. In 1869 Rev. E. B. Webb, D.D., of Chelsea, Massachusetts, (but at the time of Augusta, Maine,) preached the dedication sermon. In 1874, mainly through the efforts of Rev. Mr. Cameron, the edifice was furnished with a bell. The public school fund of the town now amounts to $800. Greenville has four excellent schoolhouses valued at $2,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $66,707. In 1880 it was $91,121.

GreeilWOOd is a pleasant farming and manufacturing town situated near the middle of Oxford County. It is bounded by Wood stock on the north-east, Bethel on the north-west, Paris at the south east, Norway on the south and Albany^ on the west. The area accord ing to the original survey, is 20,520 acres. The town is about 9 miles in length from north-west to south-east, and 4\u00a3 in width. The surface is quite broken, having about a dozen mountains and large hills. The highest of these are Mount Abram, Long, Overset, Lawrence and Patch Mountains, and Rock Dundee. Eleven ponds are shown on the town ship map, lying in a belt running north and south. Their names are North, South, Bryant's, Twitchell, Indian, Sheepskin, Overset, Hick's, Meed and Furlong. The most northerly of these empty into the An droscoggin at Bethel, while others form the source of the Little Andros coggin. The largest is South Pond, in the north-eastern part of the town. The Wentworth Caves are the most notable curiosity in Greenwood. The bed-rock in some parts is granitic, in others syenite, etc. The soil is sandy loam, and yields well in hay and potatoes, which are the crops chiefly cultivated. The town was formerly somewhat noted for its apple orchards. On the outlets of the numerous ponds are many water-powers. The town has saw and grist mills running by water power, and a spool-mill, driven by steam. The business centre within the town is at Locke's Mills, in the north-eastern part. The post-offices are at this place and Greenwood post-office, just south of the centre of the town. The settlement of Greenwood was commenced in 1802, by William Yates, who was soon followed by Thomas Furlong and Timothy Patch. In 1805 there were thirteen families: The town was incorporated in"], [270, "262 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 1816.

The rate of taxation in the latter year was 27 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 845. In 1880 it was 838. Gllilf Ord is situated in the south-western part of Piscataquis County, 8 miles from Dover, having the Piscataquis River for its southern line. Howard Plantation bounds it on the North, Foxcroft on the east, Sangerville on the south, and Abbott on the west. The Bangor and Piscataquis Railway passes through Guilford Village and the south-west corner of the town, and it is on the stage-line from Dexter to Moosehead Lake. The township was originally 6 miles square, but a small portion south of Piscataquis River was annexed to Sangerville. There are several small bodies of water, of which the outlets of Davis and Salmon ponds furnish power for mills manufac turing large and small lumber. The northern part of the town is much broken, the highest eminence being Guilford Mountain. The south ern part is of more uniform surface, having some productive farms. The chief products are wheat, oats, barley and potatoes. In 1879, 25,000 bushels of potatoes were shipped from Guilford depot; a consid erable portion of them, however, corning from neighboring towns. The rock is lime, granite and slate, and the soil a sandy loam. The principal manufactories are on the Piscataquis at Guilford Village. These consist of a woolen-mill, which produces about 625 yards of repellant cloth per day ; of mills for small and large lumber, and a grist-mill. There are, besides, the usual manufactures of a village. Guilford township wras one of those conveyed to Bowdoin College by Massachusetts. Robert Low, Jr., was the first settler, moving in with his family in 1806 ; and Robert Herring, Jr., came about three months later. Isaac, Nathaniel and John Bennett came soon after and made clearings and put up buildings. These first settlers, for want of a threshing floor, beat out their wheat upon a smooth, flat ledge. When winter came, the three Bennetts returned to their homes at New Gloucester for the winter, leaving their three boys, David, Joseph and Isaac, Jr. \u2014 aged, the two first thirteen years, and the other eleven' \u2014 to keep the house and attend to the cow. For food, the boys had milk, hulled corn, boiled wheat and roasted potatoes. In 1807 the families came permanently, also that of Mr. John Everton. The wife of the latter was an important accession to the new settlement. She was skilled in obstetrics, and for ten years was very useful for a long dis tance about, when she was greatly disabled by a fall from a horse. Deacon R. Herring brought in his family in 1808, and from this time religious meetings were held upon the Sabbath. When the settle ment consisted of eight or ten men they held a formal meeting, choos ing officers and passing such rules and regulations as good order and good feeling in the settlement required. No penalties were attached to these rules, yet the honor of the members of the community were so much involved in their observance that they were obeyed far better"], [271, "GUILFORD. 263 than most of our legislative statutes have been. In 1812 Caleb Leavitt came in from Athens, and, by virtue of a legal warrant, organized the quiet little borough of \"Lowstown\" into Plantation No. 6, 7th range. In 1816 the inhabitants petitioned the General Court for incorporation as the town of Fluvanna. The court granted the act of incorporation, but changed the name to Guilford. The first town meeting was called by a warrant from Samuel Pingree to Joseph Kelsey. Sixty-three years later, there lived but three of those who voted at that meeting \u2014 Elias Davis, Zebulon P. Grover and Isaac B. Wharfs. There are Bap tist, Universalist and Methodist societies in town, the two last having church-edifices. The buildings generally are fresh and neat in their appearance, and the Odd-Fellows' Hall, recently erected, adds to the beauty of this thrifty village. Guilford has eight public schoolhouses, 277 registered scholars, and expended for school purposes from April 1, 1878, to April 1, 1879, $1,094. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $213,091. In 1880 it was $253,578. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 2 cents on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 818. By the cen sus of 1880 it was 881. HallOWell, in Kennebec County, was incorporated in 1771, and included Augusta, Chelsea and part of Manchester. It was named for Mr. Benjamin Hallowell, who was a large proprietor in the Kenne- bec Patent. The settlement here was formerly called \" The Hook,\" the other village in town being Fort Western, now in Augusta. The latter city was set off as the town of Harrington in 1797, and Man- chester and Chelsea in 1850. Hallowell was incorporated a city in the latter year, and accepted its charter in 1852. The city is situated on the western bank of the Kennebec River, at the head of steam navigation,having Augusta for its northern boundary, Chelsea on the east, and separated from it by the Kennebec. Farming- dale bounds it on the south, and Manchester on the west. The streets and terraces of the village on the curving hillside form an amphitheatre about a little harbor made by the broadening of the river. The attrac- tiveness of this picturesque village is further enhanced by old apple- orchards at various points and shade-trees along the streets. The streams are the Kennebec, which forms its eastern boundary, and Vaughn's Brook. This brook is notable for its cascades and its historic associations. It was part of the home estate of Benjamin Vaughn, and once, if tradition is correct, served to give a wetting to Talleyrand, the celebrated prime-minister of Louis Phillipe, King of France. The power on this stream is now made useful in running a wire-factory, saw and other mills, near its junction with the Kennebec. The other manufactures are the Hallowell Cotton Manufacturing Company, run- ning 15,000 spindles ; two oilcloth factories \u2014 Sampson's and Wilder's \u2014 employing respectively 55 and 30 men ; a brass and iron foundry, and the Hallowell Granite Company, which produces about $350,000 worth of wrought stone-work annually. Most of this is from the white granite of the Hallowell quarries. Many notable monuments and buildings have been constructed from this granite, wrought in the shops at Hallowell. Among them are the Soldiers' Monument, on Boston Common ; the Sphinx, at Mount Auburn ; the Pilgrim's Mon- ument, at Plymouth, Mass.; the Fireman's Monument, at Detroit, Mich. ; Garrison's Monument and the Bridges' Tomb, at St. Louis, Mo. ;"], [272, "264 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. the Douglass Monumental Tomb, at Chicago, 111., and the new Capitol at Albany, N. Y. The number of men employed is about 120, and the monthly pay-roll of the company is about $5,000. The quarries of this company lie to the west of the village, beyond two or three hill ridges. These quarries and the prevailing rock of the territory is granite. The soil is mainly gravel, but in the northern part, clay. The Maine Central Railroad runs through the town near the river, and the Boston steamers are reached at Gardiner. The first settler within the limits of the present Hallowell was Deacon Pease Clark, who came from Attleborough, Massachusetts. His first clearing was near where the city hall now stands, and his house stood on Aca demy Street. The most prominent of the early residents of Hallowell was Dr. Benjamin Vaughn, who was born in England in 1751, and married Sarah, the eldest daughter of Benjamin Hallowell, Esq. He was a member of the British Parliament at the time of the French Revolution, and becoming compromised in some political movement that brought him into danger, he fled to France, from whence he soon after came to this country, arriving in Hallowell in 1796. Being a public spirited man, he did much for the advancement of the interests of the region. He planted a large nursery of fruit-trees, from which sprang many of the early orchards in the vicinity. His large and valuable library had a large influence in the advancement of learning in the State. Charles Vaughn, a brother of Benjamin, came to Hallowell in 1790. Together with his brother be ran a large flour-mill and brewery, and was also much devoted to agriculture and horticulture, and the importation of improved breeds of cattle. By his influence, a road was surveyed to the vicinity of Gorham, New Hampshire, with the design of making Hallowell the seaport for the country in that direction. The road was never completed, and many years later the Grand Trunk Railroad penetrated the region, carrying the business to Portland ; while the Maine Central Railroad, by its back route, took away much business that the port had before enjoyed. John Merrick, born in London of Welsh lineage, came over as tutor in the Vaughn family, and subsequently married a sister of Dr. Vaughn. He was a man of profound learning, and occupied many important positions. His death occurred in 1801 at the age of ninety-five years. Other noted citizens were Dr. John Hubbard, governor of the State from 1850 to 1853 ; John Otis, a distinguished lawyer; while the well-known authors, Jacob and J. S. C. Abbott, and General O. O. Howard, were residents for a considerable period. The city is remarkable for the longevity of its people. With a population of 3,154, it has eighty-two persons over sev enty years old, forty over eighty years, and two over ninety. Hallowell has two national banks, and one for savings. The town hall is a substan tial two-story building of brick. The Hallowell Social Library con tains about 5,000 volumes ; for which a beautiful granite building nas recently been completed at a cost of $5,000. Its newspaper, the \"\"Hal lowell Register,\" puplished by Charles E. Nash, is a valuable sheet. Mr. Nash has also become the publisher of that standard Hallowell annual, the \"Maine Farmer's Almanac.\" Hallowell's monument to her fallen heroes in the war of the Rebellion consists of a pedestal with die, and surmounted by an octagon shaft. The whole is of granite, and quite lofty."], [273, "HAMPDEN. 265 The first church was organized in 1772, Isaac Foster being the first pastor. There are now in the city houses for worship belonging to the Congregationalists, Baptists, Methodists, Free Baptists, Universalists and Roman Catholics. There is one State institution located in the city, the State Industrial School for girls. Hallowell Academy, founded in 1791, was a few years since changed into the Hallowell Classical Institute, a flourishing school under the patronage of the Congregationalists. With this the city maintains a high-school, and has nine schoolhouses. The latter are valued at $15,000. The valua tion of estates in the city in 1870 was $1,222,295. In 1880 it was $1,611,320. The population at that date was 3,007. In 1880 the in habitants numbered 3,154. Hailllin Plantation lies at the north-easteru angle of Aroostook County, 70 miles north of Houlton, on the stage line from Fort Fairfield to Van Buren. It was named in honor of Hon. Hanni bal Hamlin. The form of the town is triangular, with its base, 9 miles in length resting on the St. John. The principal stream is Hammond Brook, in the north part of the town. The surface is generally elev ated, without high hills, the highest being Cyr Hill, an elevation of about 200 feet above the plain. The soil is clay loam, and yields well in most crops of the region ; but buckwheat is principally cultivated The occupation is almost wholly agricultural. About half of the dwellings are in good repair. The roads are kept in fair condition. The plantation has a cedar bridge 250 feet in length. The New Bruns wick Railway passes on the opposite bank of the St. John. Hamlin Plantation has six public schoolhouses, valued, with land, at $565. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $28,218. In 1880 it was $38,637. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 18 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 568. In 1880 it was 612. Ilampdeil is the most south-easterly town in Penobscot County. It lies on the Penobscot River, having Bangor on the north east, Hermon on the north, Orrington on the east, separated by the Penobscot, Newburgh on the west, and Winterport, in Waldo County, on the south. The area is 23,040 acres. The surface is rolling rather than hilly. The soil is favorable for agriculture. Hermon Pond lies on the north-west corner, with which are nearly connected two smaller ponds, Stetson and Patten, lying wholly within the town. Through these ponds flows the Soadabscook, entering the Penobscot at Hamp den Village. The principal stream beside this is the west branch of the Soadabscook, rising in the south-west part of the town and empty ing into Stetson Pond in the north-west. The principal water-power is near the mouth of the Soadabscook, at Hampden village. The man ufactures of the town are paper (two mills) meal and flour, boats, barrels, coopers' ware and stock, etc. This and Hampden Corners, a short distance south on the river are considerable villages. Both are ports, and have in time past had a large maritime commerce, and still have some business on the sea. Other small villages are East and West Hampden, both in the northern part of the town. The first settler in Hampden was Benjamin Wheeler, who came from New Hampshire about 1767, and built his dwelling near the \" Basin \" at the mouth of the Soadabscook. Other settlers came in ;"], [274, "266 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. and Wheeler, being a carpenter, built mills; and the settlement soon became known as Wheelersborough. Being molested and threatened by the British, the settlers, in 1779, retired through the woods to the Kennebec, and from thence to Woolwich and Portland. In 1783 they returned. In 1796 the township was surveyed and lotted by Ephaim Ballard, and every householder received 100 acres of land. If he were a settler before 1784, he paid the government $6 ; but if afterward and before January, 1794, he paid $50. The residue of the township was assigned to General Knox, to make up for a deficiency- under the Waldo Patent. After the peace there were large accessions of settlers, \u2014 many from Cape Cod ; and in 1794 the town was incorporated. The name was chosen in honor of the English patriot, John Hampden. Among the early settlers were Gen. John Crosby, who entered into commercial business, and carried on an extensive trade both with Europe and the East Indies. Another prominent man was General Gabriel Johonot, a brave Frenchman who served under Washington, and was subsequently his friend and correspondent. Hon. Martin Kinsley, General Jedediah Herrick, Enoch Brown and John Godfrey were also prominent citizens of the town. Hon. Hannibal Hamlin, Vice-President and Senator of the United States, settled in Hampden as a lawyer about 1832. During the last war with England the United States corvette \"Adams,\" of 24 guns, commanded by Capt. Charles Morris, having struck a sunken rock in Penobscot Bay, came to Hampden to repair the injury. A principal object of the British expedition up the river in the autumn was the capture of this vessel while she was dismantled and helpless. The British force consisted of two sloops of war, one brig, and several transports, with their crews and several hundred reg ulars. Captain Morris landed his guns, and erected two batteries, one on the wharf, and one on a hill 200 yards below. The militia collected to the number of about 600 ; and under the command of General Blake, of Brewer, took up a position on the ridge to oppose the troops as they advanced up the road from where they had landed at Bald Hill Cove. When within about 300 yards of General Blake's position, the British opened fire, then advanced with fixed bayonets in \" double quick.\" Being without breastworks, and outflanked, the militia quickly gave way and made a precipitate retreat. The foe then charged on Captain Morris's batteries, driving their few defenders from their cannon at the point of the bayonet. Captain Morris at once blew up his ship, and with his men retreated to Bangor, thence to Portland. Incensed at thus losing their prize, the officers for three days permitted the sailors, marines and infantry full liberty on shore, where they com mitted many excesses in the plunder of citizens and destruction of property. When the enemy finally departed they took with them nearly 80 of the citizens as prisoners of war, who were only released on the promise of the selectmen to pay a ransom of $1,000. This incur sion was a heavy blow to the citizens of Hampden ; but they fully re covered in a few years, and have ever since continued prosperous. The well-known Hampden Academy was incorporated March, 1803, and is still doing its good work of education. Many persons who have taken leading positions in town and State were educated here. Hamp den has churches of the Congregationalists, Baptists and Methodists, there being two of the latter. The number of public schoolhouses is"], [275, "* HANCOCK COUNTY. 267 eighteen ; and the value of the school property is estimated at $10,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $739,339. In 1880 it was $676, 017. The population in 1870 was 3,068. In 1880 it was 2,911. HanCOCk is situated in the southern part of Hancock County, between Taunton Bay on the east, and Skilling Bay on the west. It is about 30 miles south-east of Bangor, and the northern part of its western line rests upon Ellsworth. The surface of the town is gener ally even, and it has a larger proportion of arable land than any other in the country. The kine are mostly Jerseys, and shorthorn and Ayr shire crosses. There is a marked neatness about the buildings which tells of industry and thrift. Two of the streams, Kilkenny and Egypt, have sufficient power to turn mills. Geologically, this is a younger town than most of its neighbors, having evidently not emerged from the waters until the close of the drift period. The course of the glacier and drift markings here range from N. 5\u00b0 W. to N. 15\u00b0 E. The \"level\" at North Hancock suggests the probability of its having been an ancient lake bottom. The south ern portion, known as \" Crabtree's Neck,\" offers attractions as a summer resort. The villages are Hancock, and North and South Hancock. There is one mill manufacturing staves, shingles and long lumber, and one producing staves and short lumber. Other manufactures are boots and shoes and wagons and sleighs. The inhabitants, especially those of the Neck, are largely engaged in Grand Bank fishing and with profit, notwithstanding some heavy losses, Hancock was incorporated in 1828, having been formed from parts of Sullivan, Trenton and Number 8. The pioneer settlers came in 1764-5. They were Oliver Wooster, Agreen Crabtree, Thomas Mc- Farland, Thomas Roger, and Joseph Googins. In 1766-8 came Philip Hodgkins; Reuben Abbot, Thomas Moon, and Richard Clark. The town furnished 115 men for the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion, paying bounty to the amount of $16,900. The three churches in town are all Baptist. Hancock has six public school houses, and its school property is valued at $3,500. Tbe valuation of estates in 1870 was $163,904. In 1880 it was $177,534. The popula tion in 1870 was 974. In the census of 1880 it was 1,093. HailCOCk COUllty has the most extensive seaboard and more numerous harbors than any other coast of equal extent in the United States. Its geographical position is mainly between 43\u00b0 58' and 45\u00b0 20' north latitude, and between 60\" 47' and 68\u00b0 30' west longitude. It is bounded by Washington County on the east, Penobscot and Waldo Counties on the north and west. From north to south it measures about 85 miles, and in width varies from 6 to 40 miles. The total area is about 1,632,000 square miles, of which 904,528 square miles is land, 637,472, ocean, 90,000 pond, and 100,000 island. Nearly one half is wild land. Hancock County contains 1 city, 31 incorporated towns, and 29 inland and island townships. Within its civic limits are hundreds of islands, one of which, Mount Desert, is the most con spicuous of any upon the whole Atlantic coast of the United States. Hancock County was organized in 1789, with Penobscot for its shire town. It then included portions of Penobscot and Waldo counties, and extended northward to the Canada line. In 1791 a portion was"], [276, "268 GAZETTEER OF MAINZ. set off and annexed to Lincoln County. In 1827, a portion was taken off for Waldo. In 1831, and again in 1844 a change was made in the partition line between Hancock and Washington Counties. In 1858, Greenfield was set off and annexed to Penobscot. The first European who made definite mention of the Penobscot bay and river, which wash its western side, was Thevet, a French explorer, in 1556. Martin Pring and Captain Weymouth, the English explorers, sailed along its shores in 1603 and 1605, and DeMonts, the Frenchman, explored some portions of the coast in 1604 and 1605. There is a tradition that Rosier, the historian of Weymouth's expedi tion, explored Deer Island thoroughfare, making a halt at the bold promontory in Brooksville, known as Cape Rosier. They fouud the county occupied by a tribe of Indians, who with those on Passama quoddy waters, were noted for their long journeys in canoes ; whence the general name for these Indians, Eteehmins. DeMonts claimed the country in the name of the King of France in the true catholic style, setting up a cross and calling the country \" Acadie.\" By this name it continued to be known until the capture of Quebec by general Wolfe in 1759. When Weymouth came in 1605, he also claimed the country in the name of his King, James I. of England. Thus the two leading powers of Europe became adverse claimants of the soil of Hancock Count}-, and the wars these claims occasioned kept the county an almost unbroken wilderness during the provincial history of Maine. Indeed, it was not until after the war of the Revolution that the French claim to the territory between the Penobscot and St. Croix was relin quished. The patent of Acadia granted to DeMonts in 1603 was surrendered two years later to Madame de Guercheville ; who, in 1613, sent over Saussaye with 25 colonists. This lady was a zealous Catholic, and wished to convert the Indians to that faith. Her colony landed on Mount Desert on May 16, 1013, where they built a fort, erected a cross, celebrated mass, and named the place \" St. Sauveur.\" The exact locality is now supposed to be that now known as Ship Harbor, in the town of Tremont. The \" Pool \" at Somes' Sound, is supposed to have been the place where the Jesuit missionaries, Biard and Masse, located themselves in 1609. This colony was attacked, captured, and removed from the island in the same season by Captain Argall, of Virginia. The first English possession was a trading post of the Pilgrims at Pentagoet (Castine) in 1625-6. This, however, soon fell into the hands of the French, and the flag of France floated over it during nearly the whole of the 17th century. The indications of old French settlements have also been found at Castine, Newbury Neck, Surry, Oak Point, Trenton, East Lemoine, Crabtree's Neck, Hancock, Butler Point, Franklin, Waukeag Neck and Sullivan. No permanent English settle ments were made until after the fall of Quebec, in 1759. The first grants of land in the county were six townships, each six miles square, between the rivers Penobscot and Union (then known as the Donaqua), which were granted to David Marsh et als, by the Gene ral Court of Massachusetts, upon conditions, one of which was that they should settle each township with 60 Protestant families within six years. These grants were No. 1, Bucksport; 2, Orland ; 3, Penob scot ; 4, Sedgewick ; 5, Bluehill; and 6, Surry. Six other townships east of the Union River were granted on the same terms ; three of which are in this county, viz. : No. 1, Trenton, granted to Eben"], [277, "HANCOCK COUNTY. 269 Thorndike, et als ; 2, Sullivan, to David Bean, et als ; and 3, Mount Desert (Island) to Governor Bernard. The surveys were made by Samuel Livermore ; and as there were three of the townships on each side of the river, it gave rise to the name which the stream now bears. The grantees individually bound themselves in a penal bond of $50, conditioned to lay out no one of the townships more than six miles in extent on the banks of the Penobscot, or on the sea-coast ; to build sixty dwelling-houses, at least 18 feet square; to fit for tillage 300 acres of land, erect a meeting-house and settle a minister. There were reserved in each township one lot for a parsonage, another for the first settled minister, a third for Harvard College, and a fourth for the use of Schools ; making 1,200 acres in each township, reserved for public uses. The King of France, about the year 1688, gave to a French gentle men named Cadilliac a tract of land in Acadia embracing the whole of Mount Desert Island, and a portion of the mainland. This he held till 1713, styling himself \" Lord of Donaqua and Mount Desert.\" After the war of the Revolution, one M.Gregoire claimed tiie whole island in right of his wife, Maria T., a grand-daughter of Cadilliac. Governor Bernard, to whom the island had been granted lost his title by confis cation, but one half of it had been restored to his son John. In con sideration of a request made by Lafayette in favor of the Gregoire's claim, Massachusetts recognized it as valid ; and this is the only French claim ever sustained to lands in Maine. The heir of Cadilliac therefore received a quit-claim deed for 60,000 acres on the mainland. This included the present towns of Trenton and Lemoine, with a part of Sullivan, Ellsworth, IL.ncock, Eden and Mount Desert, with the islands in front of the seaboard. A survey of this grant was made by John Peters in 1789. In 1786, Massachusetts attempted a lottery sale of fifty townships of land between Penobscot and Passamaquoddy. These were exempt from taxes for fifteen years. There were 2,720 tickets, and the price was $2 each. Every one was a prize ticket ; the smallest prize being a tract of land a half mile square, and the largest six miles square. Leonard Jar vis of Surry, was one of the five managers. On the draw ing of the lottery, only 437 were found to be sold and 165,280 acres drawn ; while 942,112 acres remained unsold. The average price realized by the government for the lands drawn was about 52 cents per acre. The lots not drawn, and also the greater part of the prize lots were purchased by William Bingham, of Philadelphia, a man of great wealth. He died in England in 1803, leaving one son and two daughters. One of the daughters married Alexander Baring, of London, who subsequently became Lord Ashburton ; and as ambassador to the United States in 1842, framed with the secretary of state, Daniel Webster, the treaty fixing the eastern and western boundary of Maine, known as the \" Webster-Ashburton Treaty.\" The lottery townships in Hancock County sold to Mr. Bingham were Nos. 14, 15 and 16, (possibly, also, those \"up river\" townships sold to him,) each containing 23,040 acres. The conveyance of these three was made January 28, 1793, by Samuel Phillips, Leonard Jarvis and John Reed, a committee appointed by the General Court of Massa chusetts. In 1792, Barthelemy de Gregoire sold 23,121 acres of his grant to Henry Jackson, of Boston ; which in 1796, was purchased by Mr. Bingham, who about the same time also purchased the residue of"], [278, "270 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. the Gregoire grant. Col. John Black, an Englishman by birth, who resided at Ellsworth for many years, was agent for the Bingham heirs. Hancock County has one mountain chain, and one group of moun tains. The line stretching across Mount Desert Island is a continua tion of the Schoodic system, as are also Mount Desert Island and the Porcupines. There are thirteen well-defined peaks on Mount Desert Island, of which Green Mountain, in Eden, is highest, having an alti tude of 1,522 feet above the sea. In Dedham is a mountain group, where ten mountains are clustered together, from which the town has gained the name of the \" Switzerland of America.\" The other elevations suf ficiently high to deserve the name of mountains, are Blue Hill Moun tain, in Blue Hill ; Bull Hill Mountain, in Eastbrook ; Ball and Tunk Mountain, in Number 10, and Lead Mountain, in Number 28. There are narrow defiles of the gorge form at Morgan's Bay, Surry, McHeard's Landing, in Blue Hill, and near Mason's Mills, in Orland. There is much waste land, known as \" Heaths.\" The county has three drainage streams : the Penobscot River on the west, the Union in the Middle, and Narraguagus on the east. The area within the county, tributary to each drainage basin, as computed from Waiting's surveys, is Union River, 516,li50 acres ; Penobscot River, 252,440 acres; Narraguagus River, 113,510 acres. There are about 300 islands within the county limits, 270 of which are represented on the county map. The light stations in the county are No. 10, Prospect Harbor, 5th order ; 11, Winter Harbor, 5th order ; 12, Mount Desert, 3d order ; 13, Egg Rock, 4th order ; 14, Baker's Island, 4th order ; 15, Bear Island, 5th order ; 16, Bass Harbor, Head, 5th order ; 17, Burnt Coat Harbor, 5th order; 18, Burnt Coat Harbor 4th order; 19, Egge moggin, 5th order ; 20, Saddleback Ledge, 5th order ; 22, Deer Island Thoroughfare, 4th order ; 23, Eagle Island Point, 4th order ; 24, Pumpkin Island, 5th order ; 33, Dice's Head, 4th order ; total number, fifteen. The rock formation of the county is mainly granite, syenite and gneiss. The granite formation appearing at the surface at Deer Isle continues in a curve through Blue Hill, Sedgewick, Brooksville, Orland, North Ellsworth, Number 8, Franklin, Sullivan, and ends at Mount Desert. In Eden there is red granite. Most of the granite in Bucks port, Orland, Dedham, Waltham and Eastbrook is porphyritic, with black mica, like those huge bowlders at Ellsworth Falls. Within the horse-shoe-like circle of granite which curves from Deer Isle to Mount Desert, the rock is mostly mica schist, or a micaeous slate. The valley bed of the Union River basin is of this rock. The most abun dant variety of this class of rock consists of alternate layers of mica and quartz. It indicates the presence of gold rather than coal. At Buck's Harbor, in Brooksville, Green's Landing, in Deer Isle, McHeards, in Blue Hill, at Somes Sound, and in Sullivan and Franklin, the gran ite crops out in massive form. Extensive deposits of plastic clay are found at Castine, Penobscot, Ellsworth and Surry. The whole extent of the county is what is termed a \" glaciated surface,\" the soil of which is formed chiefly of the simple geological formation \" drift.\" The course of this drift is shown by the stri\u00e6, or scratches upon the ledges, varying from N. 15\u00b0 W. to N. 15\u00b0 E.

Hancock County has two cus toms districts, two ports of entry, six deputy districts, eight ports of delivery, twenty-six hailing ports, and thirteen United States custom house officials. The county was organized in 1789, being named in honor of John Hancock. Portions were taken from it in 1816 to form Penobscot, and in 1827, to form Waldo. Ellsworth has been the shire town since 1837. The valuation of estates in the county in 1870 was $7,554,073. In 1880 it was $7,897,488. The population in 1870 was 36,495. In 1880 it was 38,131. HanOVer, in Oxford County, lies on the north side of Bethel, of which it was formerly a part. It constituted the north-east corner of the latter town, and is separated from it by the Androscoggin River. Its form is that of a triangle, having for its base the irregular line ot the Androscoggin. The extreme length in a direct line on the river is about 5 miles. Rumford bounds it on the north-east, and Newry on the north-west. The surface is broken and uneven. Bear and Bart lett mountains are the principal eminences, and Howe's Ledge a prom inent object. Howard's Pond, with an area of 250 acres, has an alti tude of 365 feet above the Androscoggin into which it empties 1\u00a3 miles southward. The forests contain the large variety of trees com mon in the region. The town has some of the best interval farms in the State. The soil is a fine loam, yielding well of all crops, but chiefly hay. The rock in general is a coarse granite. The water-power is on the outlet of Howard's Pond. There is a dam near the pond. At Hanover Village, a canal on each side of the stream conducts water to the mills, of which there are seven. There is also a steam mill for the manufacture of dowels. The other manu factures are woollens, leather, boots and shoes, furniture, flour, meal, lono- and short lumber, sash, blinds and doors, rakes, etc. Locke's Mills, on the Grand Trunk Railway, 7 miles distant, is the nearest station. The town is on the stage-route from Andover to Bryant's Pond, another station on the Grand Trunk. Hanover was first settled by Nathaniel Segar, from Newton, Mass., in the spring of 1774. He was subsequently in the United States service until 1780, when he again became a resident of Hanover. In 1781, he was taken captive by the Indians on their .last hostile incur sion in Maine, and was held a prisoner by them for sixteen months. He then a third time returned to this place, where he spent the remain der of his days. In 1780 and soon after came Jonathan Bean, Jesse Duston, Moses and Stephen Bartlett.

HarmOliy lies in the eastern part of Somerset County, 19 miles north-east of Skowhegan. It is bounded on the east by Cam bridge, Ripley and St. Albans, on the south by Hartland, west by mountainous Athens, and north by Wellington, in Piscataquis County. The area is 36 square miles. This town is the first east and south of the hilly region extending from the Kennebec into the south-west parts of Piscataquis County. The surface is moderately uneven, with hills in the north-western part. Moose Pond, about 10 miles square, oc cupies most of the southern line. The other ponds are Little and Mill, both on the main stream of the Sebasticook, in the eastern part of the town. The water-powers are at Main Stream Village, and on Higgins Stream, at Harmony Village, at the centre of the town. At the latter place are a machine-shop, and a saw-mill capable of manu facturing 500,000 boards and 150,000 shingles annually. At Main Stream Village is a grist-mill, a carding and satinet mill, and a saw mill of the capacity of producing 500, OuO feet of boards and 1,000,000 shingles annually. Harmony has a soil that is moderately productive, and there are many well-stocked farms. The town is the terminus of the stage-line from Pittsfield, on the Maine Central Railroad. Harmony was originally granted by Massachusetts to Hallowell Academy, and was purchased of that institution by Charles Vaughn of that town. It was settled in 1796, bearing the name of Vaughnstown until June 15, 1804, when it was incoi] orated under its present name. The churches of this town are a Methodist, a Free Baptist and a Union. Harmony has eleven public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $3,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $190,606. In 1880 it was $189,751. The population in 1870 was 978. In 1880 it was 881. HarpSWell is the south-easterly town of Cumberland County. It consists of a peninsula 9 miles in length, extending south-westward, with a parallel line of islands on each side. These are known as Harpswell Neck, and, on the east, Great Island, Orr's Island, with numerous smaller ones. Between the peninsula and the Islands named is the long Harpswell Harbor. On the west side of the peninsula is Middle Bay. These two bodies of water at their northern extremity approach so near to each other that where it joins Brunswick, the peninsula is little more than 45 rods wide. Great Island, the largest of the islands, and the most easterly part of the town, is separated from West Bath by New Meadows River. The three larger islands have their greatest length nearly north and south, and succeed each"], [281, "HARPSWELL. 273 other in the same direction. The two first are connected with each other, and the first with the mainland by bridges. Each is penetrated from the north and from the south by several harbors and inlets, and their surfaces are varied by hill, valley and forest. Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe has spent many summer months upon these islands, making the middle one of the line the scenery of her delightful story, \" The Pearl of Orr's Island.\" She says that the scenery of Harpswell is \"of more varied and singular beauty than can ordinarily be found on the shores of any land whatever.\" At a distance of about four miles from the railroad station at Brunswick, \" the traveller crosses an arm of the pea, and comes upon the first of the interlacing group of islands which beautifies the shore. A ride across this island is a constant succession of pictures, whose wild and solitary beauty entirely distances all power of description. The magnificence of the evergreen forests, the rich intermingling ever and anon of groves of birch, beech and oak, in picturesque knots and tufts, as if set for effect by some skilful landscape gardener, produce a sort of strange, dreamy wonder; while the sea, breaking forth on the right hand and on the left of the road into the most romantic glimpses, seems to flash and glitter like some strange gem which every moment shows itself through the frame-work of a new setting.\" Ragged Island, which lies broad off in the ocean east of Bailey's Island, is supposed to be the \" Elm Island \" of Rev. Elijah Kellogg's stories. A legend of these isles is preserved in his vigorous verse by Wbittier, in \" The Dead Ship of Harpswell\" \u2014 a spectre ship which comes driving in as an omen of death, but never reaches land : \u2014 \" In vain o'er Harpswell Neck the Star Of evening guides her in, In vain for her the lamps are lit Within thy tower, Seguin ! In vain the harbor-boat shall hail ; In vain the pilot call ; No hand shall reef her spectral sail, Or let her anchor fall.\" The Neck affords many attractive points for summer sojourn, especially at the southern part. On the western side, about midway of the length of the Neck, is Lookout Point, a small, abrupt, rocky promontory pointing north, and enclosing a pebbly cove fringed by a belt of spruces. On the south side of the point the shore for some distance is high, and of perpendicular rock, over whose edge the tall grasses wave, dropping their blooms into the foamy tide below.. A few feet back the tall birch, maple, spruce and hemlock wave their graceful branches and spread their broad arms toward each other with the most sylvan effect. A valuable mineral spring has recently been discovered on Bailey's Island. In summer there is steamer connection with Portland, 14 miles distant ; and it is nearly the same distance from the landing at the southern extremity of the town to the railroad station at Brunswick, with which there is a stage connection. The Neck formerly bore the aboriginal name of Merryconeag, and Great Island was called Erascohegan and Sebascodiggin. The soil of Harpswell consists of gravelly loam in the higher lands and clay loam in the lower parts, and is tolerably productive. Agri culture, the fisheries, ship and boat building are the principal occupa- 18"], [282, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 274 tions of the people, though the increasing number of health and pleasure 6eekers are furnishing the town with another source of profit. At the Basin, on the south-western side of the peninsula, is a grist-mill run by tide-power, which grinds 800 bushels of corn daily. The first preacher in Harpswell was Richard Pateshall, who gra duated at Harvard College in 1735. A church was formed in 1753, and Rev. Elisha Eaton ordained over it. He remained until his death in 1754, and was succeeded by his son, Samuel Eaton, who also remained until his death, which occurred in 1822, at the age of eighty five years. There are now a Congregationalist, Baptist, Free Baptist, Universalist, a Union, and two Methodist churches in the town. Harpswell has sixteen public schoolhouses, of the estimated value of $7,600. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $454,601. In 1880 it was $499,621. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 98 cents per $100. The population in 1870 was 1,749. In the census of 1880 it is given as 1,772. HaiTillgstOn is a seaboard town in the south-western part of Washington County, 24 miles west of Machias. It is on the stage line from Bangor to Eastport and Calais. The town is penetrated by Pleasant and Flat Bays and Harrington River. The streams are Great Marsh Stream and Cole's Brook. The eastern part of the town forms a long peninsula between Pleasant Bay and Harrington River, and at the end is Ripley's Neck. On the river, near the northern part of the town, are shipyards where many small vessels are built. Accord ing to Williams on [History of Maine, Vol. ii. p. 576], the town embraces eleven inslands, viz. : Bobear, Pond, Trafton's, Dyer's, Knox, Flint, Gourd, Strout, Jordan's Delight, Ship-stern, Four Acre Island, and one other. The rock in this town is granitic in character. The surface of the land is level, the soil of sandy loam, and not generally fertile. The principal crops are wheat and potatoes. Spruce, fir and birch are the forest trees. At the village, a few elms and maples along the streets add to its attractiveness. The public and private dwellings are gen erally in good repair. The town-hall is two stories in height, the lower one being occupied for schoolrooms. The village has a library of 300 volumes. An obelisk of white marble, in a conspicuous spot, forms the memorial to the fallen soldiers of the Union belonging in this town. The roads in the town are very good, and there is a stone bridge 150 feet in length. There are three shipbuilding firms in the town, a boat-builder, a sail-maker, a boot and shoe manufacturer, and a steam-mill for meal, flour and lumber. Harrington was No. 5 of the six second-class townships east of Union River granted by Massachussets in 1762 to an association of petitioners. The settlement was commenced shortly after ; and on June 17, 1796, it was incorporated under its present name. The Bap tists and Methodists each have a church in the town. The number erf public schoolhouses is nine, valued, with appurtenances, at $3,300. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $249,203. In 1880 it was $295,878.

Naples bounds it on the south, and on the north lie Waterford and Norway, both in Oxford County. Crooked River forms the eastern line for almost the entire length of the town. Long Pond, which separates it from Harrison, furnishes transportation by means of steamer to the station of ths Portland and Ogdensburg Railway, at the southern ex tremity of Lake Sebago. The length of the town from north to south is about ten miles \u2014 twice its width. The business centres are at Harrison Village, on Lake Sebago, and Bolster's Mills- on Crooked River. The former is the northern landing for the steamers and draws the trade from a wide extent of back country. Separated from Long Pond only by the territory of the village is Anonymous Pond, about a square mile in area, and furnish ing power for the factory of the Eastern Wire Co., whose product is valued at about $50,000 per annum. Bolster's Mills, the other village, is situated on Crooked River, and nearly midway of the eastern side of the town. There is here a saw-mill and a grist-mill, carding-mill, tannery, etc. Harrison was incorporated in 1805, deriving its name from Harri son Gray Otis, of Boston, who was a large proprietor in the township. Though quite a manufacturing and commercial town, Harrison has many fine farms, and her agricultural product compares well with that of the neighboring towns. The leading denominations have churches in the town or at its border. Harrison has nine schoolhouses, val ued at $1,800. The estates were valued in 1870 at $304,635.

The form of the town is that of an irregular triangle, with its base toward the north, having its two sides about 7| miles in length, and its base about 5+ miles. The surface of the town is generally hilly-. Three bear the names, Greenwood Hill, Ben Burrow's Hill and Streaked Mountain, \u2014 the last being the highest. It is situated in the north-west corner of the town, and is a large and rather smooth eleva tion rising to a height of nearly 1,600 feet above the plain. Its surface 6hows a large proportion of solid rock, covered in such a way by soil and shrubbery as to cause the appearance from which it gains its name. The numerous ledges are generally a coarse granite, and the soil has a good sprinkling of stones. Some of the hills are rocky and precipitous, while good farms are found on the declivities of others. All the usual farm crops are cultivated, but that of hay has probably a larger value than any other The principal body of water is Matthews Pond, on the south-west border of the town ; which has a length of one mile, and a width of about one-fourth of a mile. The chief streams are Bog Brook and the Middle Branch. The small water-power of the town is mainly furnished by the outlet of Matthews Pond. The Rumford Falls and Buckfield Railroad runs through the town. The territory constituting the town of Hebron was granted by Massachusetts to Alexander Shepard, Jr., of Newton, Mass., in March, 1777, in return for a chart of a coast survey in which Mr. Shepard had assisted. The survey was said to have been made by an Englishman, and completed just at the time when the colonies began to pay English demands in a currency less acceptable than cash ; and he abruptly quitted America, but left his chart behind him. Subsequently Shepard extended his claim over the neighboring isolated tracts, until it em braced above 36,000 acres. He with Dr. Goddard and John Green wood were subsequently influential settlers of the region. The first settler w-as probably John Caldwell of Ipswich, and the first resident family that of Capt.

Other early settlers were Nicholas Hamlin, Benjamin Skillings, John Cates, George, Elisha and Ebenezer Morton, and Nathaniel Knight, most of whom were from Gorham. The town was a part of the Waldo Patent. Gen. Henry Knox, who soon after the Revolution became proprietor of this patent, sold a few lots to settlers, then disposed of all that remained to Israel Thorn dike, David Sears and William Prescott. Thorndike was a citizen of Boston, but, having a taste for agricultural pursuits, he cleared up and cultivated a large farm near the centre of the township, which he stocked with horses, kine, sheep and poultry, and set out an orchard of 500 apple trees. The place was long after his death known as the \" Great Farm,\" but has since deteriorated. The plantation was organized in 1812, and incorporated as a town in 1818. It was probably named in honor of General Jackson, after ward President, who had just become celebrated and popular. The Congregationalists and Free Baptists each, have a church in town. The number of schoolhouses is ten ; and the value of the school property is $3,000. The valuation of estates in 187.0 was $176, 604. In 1880 it was $159,315. The population in 1870 w.as 707.

It is bounded north by Wilton, east by Chester- ville, south by Livermore and East Livermore, in Androscoggin County. The town is nearly square in its form, and has an area of about 18,000 acres. The Androscoggin River runs south-eastward across the south- western corner. The only other stream of magnitude is a large brook which conies down from Dixfield and Wilton through the western part of the town. The largest sheet of water is Perkin's Pond, which has an area of about 150 acres. The highest eminence in town is Spruce Mountain, which has an altitude of about 2,000 feet. The usual varie- ties of *rees are found in the forests. The rock is principally granite. The soil is loamy, and quite productive. Hay, corn, wheat, potatoes, -oats and apples are raised in quantities beyond the need of the town. On the Androscoggin River in this town are three excellent water lowers \u2014 the aggregate fall being about 36 feet. That near Jay Bridge is improved by a good dam, on which is a saw-mill. Jay Steam Saw- Mill has an engine of 150 horse-power. At North Jay is a saw-mill, a brick-yard and several granite quarries. Bean's Corner has a car- riage-factory, and East Jay has a saw-mill. The Farmington Railroad passes through the town, having a station at Jay Bridge and at North Jay. The township which is now Jay was granted to Capt. Joseph Phips and sixty-three others, for services in the French war of 1755, and was for a Jong time known as Phip's Canada. It was incorporated in 1795, and named for Hon. John Jay. the eminent patriot and statesmen. The conditions of the grant were that it should be divided into rights of 400 acres each, one of which was to be reserved for Harvard Col- lege, one for the use of the University, and one for the schools. A settling committee appointed by the associates subsequently purchased the whole. There were no settlements previous to the close of the Revolutionary war. The earliest settlers were Simon Coolidge, Oliver Fuller, Samuel Eustis, Scarborough Parker, Moses Crafts, Isaac West, Thomas Fuller, Joseph Hyde, Nathaniel Jackson, Samuel Jackson, William Godding and William Atkinson. Jay Hill \u2014 where there is now a small village, and abridge across the Androscoggin \u2014 was first settled by James Starr in 1802.

The chief of these is Damariscotta Lake, which sepa rates the town from Nobleboro, and the Great Bay, a continuation of the lake lying wholly in the north-eastern part of the town. About the head of this pond is some very pleasant scenery; and a sail the length of the lake is charming. Dyer's Long Pond lies in the centre of the town, and sends its waters through the town of Newcastle to Sheep scot River. Pleasant Pond lies on the western border, partly in the town of Whitefield. Damariscotta Lake, including Great Bay, has an area of about 10 square miles; Long Pond 1.20 square miles, and Pleasant Pond, 1.10 square miles. There are several smaller sheets of water. The surface of the town is hilly. The principal occupation of the people is agriculture. There is at East Jefferson, on Damariscotta Lake, a flourishing cheese factory. At this place there are also lum ber, stave and shingle mills, a wooden pump and a carriage factory, etc. At West Jefferson are a shingle-mill and potash factory. Jefferson and South Jefferson are the other centres. Jefferson is on the stage line from Augusta to Waldoboro, and is 24 miles from the former, and 20 miles from Wiscasset. Newcastle adjoining on the south has the nearest railroad station. The town was settled a few years previous to the Revolutionary war. John Ball, John Weeks, Ezra Parker, Jonathan Fish, Jonathan Eames, Jonathan Linscott, Joseph Jones and Thomas Kennedy were the first settlers. Jefferson was originally included with Whitefield in the territory known as Ballstown, from the first settler, who came in 1770. Many of the first settlers came from Boothbay and Woolwich. The town was included in the \"Brown Claim,\" \u2014 for which see Nobleborough. There were difficulties between the proprietors and settlers, which were adjusted by referees, and titles obtained from Massachusetts in 1814. The price paid by those who settled before 1784, was 13 cents per acre ; by those who settled later, 30 cents. Alphonso Ross, Esq., of the \" Boston Advertiser,\" is a native of this town. The churches are the first, second and third, \u2014 all Baptist. Jefferson has fourteen public schoolhouses. The total expenditure for schools in the year ending April 1, 1879, was $2,661.

It is on the Bangor and Calais stage route. Chandler's River, the principal stream, has two good powers, \u2014 \"Great Falls,\" and \"The Mills\" at the village at the head of the tide. There are now in operation in the town one mill for long lumber and one lath and shingle mill. Granite and syenite are underlying rocks in some parts. The soil is clay loam. The principal crop is hay. Birch, spruce, and fir constitute what forest remains. This town was contained in the grant by Massachusetts to John C. Jones and others in 1789, of 48,160 acres. Judah Chandler is sup posed to have been the first settler. He arrived in 1763 or 1764, building a house and mill in the latter year, near the site of the Whit ney mills. Joel Whitney, father of Captain Ephraim Whitney, came from Portland about 1767. Captain Whitney was a member of Mas sachusetts Legislature two years, of the convention in 1820 to form a constitution for Maine, and represented his district in the legislature of the new State. Captain Samuel Watts, from Falmouth, removed here in 1769, and Josiah Weston in 1772. The latter married Hannah, the daughter of Captain Watts, in 1774. This noble woman is intimately connected with the history of the town, especially by her remarkable night journey to Machias to bring powder to the patriots for the cap ture of the British armed schooner, Margaretta. She died in 1855, in the 97th year of her age. The town was incorporated in 1809; its name being chosen in honor of the leading proprietor. Previously it had borne the name of Chand ler's River. The section at its settlement was remarkably well wooded. The first ship was sailed up the river in 1785, by Captain Locke, for purposes of trade. Near the village are the agricultural grounds and buildings, where the fairs of the West Washington Agricultural Society are held. Jonesborough furnished 16 men to the Union forces in the war of the Rebellion, and lost seven. There is a neat church in the town used by the denominations in common. The number of public schoolhouses is six ; and the school property is valued at $2,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $86,990. In 1880 it was $80,000. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 42 mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 522. In 1880 it was 552. JOneSpOrt, in the western part of Washington County, is nearly all seaboard. Two-thirds of the width of the town is joined to Jonesborough on the north, but Addison, lying on the west, is sepa rated from it by Indian River. Mason's Bay lies on the east, Jonesport Harbor on the west, and on the south is Moosabeck Reach, which, pro tected by numerous islands, affords a good haven. Belonging to the town are Great Wass, Beal's, Head Harbor, Steel Harbor, and Moose islands, with several smaller. On Indian River, near its mouth, is a fall of ten feet, affording a good water-power. Jonesport has its shipyards, a lobster-canning factory, two boat-builders, a sailmaker, riggers, etc. This town is 20 miles south-west of Machias, and is the terminus of"], [301, "KENDUSKEAG. 293 the stage-line from Columbia Falls. The territory of the town is small, and a large proportion of the inhabitants find their occupation on the sea. Jonesport was set off from Jonesborough, and incorporated Feb. 3, 1832. Its early history is involved with that of the parent town. The Congregationalists have a society and sustain a minister here ; and there is a Union church. The number of public schoolhouses is eight. The school property is valued at $5,900. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $156,388. In 1880 it was $192,984. The popula tion in 1870 was 1,305. In 1880 it was 1,561. Katalldill IrOll Works are situated nearly 50 miles south of the mountain whose name they bear. Their location is in No. 6, Range 9, on the north of Williamsburg. The west branch of Pleasant River flows through the township, and upon its banks are some excellent intervals. The first clearing was made in this township as early as 1814. A deposit of bog iron ore was found upon the northern half of this township at the foot of Ore Mountain sometime before 1843. In that year the development of the mine was commenced, and the construction of the works for smelting. The north half of the township had been granted to Warren Academy, in 1808. Walter Smith, of Newmarket, bought most of this portion, and he and his son Edward, of Bangor, at once began the improvements. They sold in 1845, and Messrs. Pingree and Company of Salem became the owners ; the latter also relinquished the business, and the property passed into the hands of Hinckley and Egery of Bangor. It was started again by a company, O. W. Davis, jun., being treasurer and chief manager. When running it gives employment to a large number of workmen in cutting and hauling wood for the furnaces with charcoal, in hauling the products to the railway station in Milo, 16 miles distant. Other valuable minerals, as paint and copperas, are obtained there in paying quantities, while the ore improves in quality and gives no sign of exhaustion.

It is less than half the size of the neighboring townships, which are mostly 6 miles square. There is one hill 30 or 40 feet high, of the kind known as \" horsebacks.\" The surface is very even, with a clay loam soil that is easily cultivated and yields well. Hay is the most valuable crop. The forests are made up of the trees common to the county. The Kenduskeag River runs through the midst of the town from north-west to south-east, fur nishing, at the village, near the centre, the power for several mills.

There is here a sub stantial covered bridge, 130 feet in length, spanning the Kenduskeag. Bangor affords the nearest railroad connection. The early history of this town is found in the accounts of Levant and Glenburn, from each of which a portion of its territory was taken. It was incorporated Feb. 20, 1852. Among the original settlers of the town were Lemuel H. Hasey, three sons of Major Hodson, and a son of Pecallis Clark. The town furnished 103 men to the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion, losing 37. The Congregationalists and Universalists each have a good church edifice. The number of public schoolhouses is four. The school prop erty is valued at $2,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $171,230. In 1880 it was $181,700.

The lake is the source of the \" Sparkling Kennebago \" River, which empties into Rangely Lake, all famous for trout-fishing. KeniiebeC Coilllty occupies the most valuable section of Kennebec River. The surface, though hilly, is not mountainous. It contains a large number of ponds, and many fine water-powers. The territory is nearly that of the Kennebec Patent, but it somewhat overpasses the limits of that patent as finally settled. The indefinite description of those limits caused much litigation, but was finally set tled in 1757, by reference to five eminent lawyers. By their decision, the southern boundary of the patent was placed at the northern line of the town of Woolwich, in the present county of Sagadahoc, and the northern boundary at what is now the southern line of Cornville, in Somerset County. Briefly stated, the patent, as settled, covered ter ritory 30 miles wide (15 miles wide on each side of the Kennebec River), and extended from Merry-meeting Bay to the falls below Norridgewock, and contained 1,500,000 acres. The tract was valuable in the early period of the country on account of the trade with the natives, and its fisheries. In 1640, the proprietors of the patent ceded it to the whole body of freemen of Plymouth Colony. Between 1648 and 1653, the colony obtained from the Indian sagamores deeds of the land extending from Cushnoc (now Augusta), to the northern limit of the grant, built one or two small forts on the river, and sent magis trates into the region to protect their rights. Their monopoly was often intruded upon, and caused them so much annoyance that in 1661 they sold their entire right in the patent for \u00a3400 sterling to four men, Antipas Boies, Edward Tyng, Thomas Brattle and John Winslow. The settlement of the river was very slow, so that in 1675, when the first Indian war broke out, there were scarcely 100 persons resid ing on or near the river. In 1676 the buildings northward of Swan Island were all destroyed, and the inhabitants driven away. Under an act passed by General Court in 1753, a new corporation was formed with the name of \" The Proprietors of Kennebec Purchase from the late Colony of New Plymouth,\" which was usually contracted to"], [303, "KENNEBEC COUNTY. 295 \" Plymouth Company \" in actual use. In 1818, the corporation, hav ing disposed of all its interest in the territory, ceased to exist. The Kennebec River, when first visited by the English, was occu pied by a powerful tribe of Indians called Canibas. It numbered about 1,500 warriors at this time. Their various villages formed sub tribes, all of which acknowledged allegiance to the great chief, Kenne bis, who resided on Swan Island, opposite what is now the town of Richmond. The chief villages were Norridgewock, Taconet (at Waterville) and Cushnoc (Augusta). Sebastian Rasle, a Roman Cath olic missionary, resided at Norridgewock for many years, exercised a powerful influence over the whole tribe. The first trading-posts on the Kennebec were established at Augusta and Richmond in 1629, the same year that the patent was obtained by the New Plymouth proprietors. In 1754, in order to give security to the settlements in the region, the Plymouth Company built Fort West ern at Cushnoc by agreement with the government of Massachusetts, which built in the same and following year Fort Halifax, in what is now the town of Winslow, and Fort Shirley in Dresden, opposite the other end of Swan Island. At about the same time, Dr. Sylvester Gardiner, agent of the Plymouth Company, made bis residence on the Kennebec, the better to effect settlements. Soon after the above date he erected two saw-mills, a grist-mill and a fulling-mill, a wharf, stores and dwel ling-houses in the town which now bears his name. The downfall of the French power in the north brought security to the settlements of Maine, and those on the Kennebec soon greatly increased. In 1760 two counties called Cumberland and Lincoln were organized from old York County. Lincoln County at that time included the territory of the Kennebec Patent, and the proprietory company erected buildings for the new county at Pownalborough, now Dresden. The old court-house has been changed into a dwelling-house, and is still in a good state of preservation. In 1799 the northern part of Lincoln County was erected into anew county bjr the name of Kennebec, with Augusta as the shire town. In 1809, Somerset County was organized, by which Kennebec County lost nearly four-fifths of its territory. Waldo County, formed in 1827, took from it four towns, \u2014 Unity, Free dom, Joy and Burnham. By the organization of Franklin County in 1838, Kennebec lost the towns of New Sharon, Chesterville, Wilton, Temple and Farmington ; and at the incorporation of Androscoggiij County, the towns of East Livermore, Greene, Leeds, and Wales, were dissevered from the County of the Kennebec. It is now made up of 24 towns and 3 cities. The last are Augusta, Hallowell and Gardiner, situated upon the Kennebec, the first and last only 6 miles apart, and the second between them. In 1787, Hallowell (then including Augusta), was made a half shiretown with Pownalborough, the session being held at Fort West ern. The judges were William Lithgow, James Howard and Nathaniel Thwing. In 1788, William Lithgow, jr., opened an office at Fort Western settlement, and was therefore the first lawyer resident in what is now Kennebee County. The first court-house was built in Au gusta (then a part of Hallowell), in 1790, and stood in Market Square. In 1801, Kennebec County having been incorporated and Augusta set off from Hallowell, a new court-house was begun on the site of the present jail. In 1827, the present granite court-house wa3 erected."], [304, "GAZETEEER OF MAINE. 296 A jail of wood was erected in 1793, but was burned in 1808. Another built at that time remained in use until 1859. In the latter year was completed a new jail of granite, iron and brick, at a cost of over $50,000. It is considered to be the finest building in the city, and the finest and most substantial building for its purpose in the State. Kennebec, though one of the smallest counties in area, is one of the best, and at present the very best agricultural county in the State. The soil along the river on both sides is, to a great extent, of clay loam, and easily cultivated and productive; and probably a larger crop of hay is harvested in the river towns of this county than in any other equal area in New England. The underlying rock is chiefly granite, and quarries of fine quality are operated in Hallowell. The ice business is also an important industry; and probably no section of equal ex tent in the world yields a larger supply, or a superior quality, of this very useful article. Kennebec County has several agricultural societies, all in a flour ishing condition. It has three hundred and forty-nine schoolhouses, valued at $243,781,. Its real estate in 1870 was valued at $21,004,034. In 1880 it was $23,292,164. The population at the same date was 53,203. In 1880 it was 52,061 ; of these 26,423 are male and 26,638 females. The natives number 49,565, aud foreign born 3,496. There are 123 colored inhabitants. KeimebeC Purchase. See article on Kennebec County. KeniiebeC River.

The Boston and Maine and Portland, Saco and Portsmouth railroads pass through the town. Previous to its incorporation, in 1820, it was em braced in the town of Wells. It is bounded on the east by Kenne bunk Port, on the south by the ocean, on the west by Wells, and on the north by the towns of Sanford, Alfred and Lyman. It contains 9,876 acres of land. Four small villages constitute the business centre of the town, bearing respectively the names, Kennebunk Village, Depot and Landing, and Harbor Village. The harbor is small but safe, being defended by strong granite piers. The beaches and sea-repelling cliffs about Cape Arundel form noble combinations of scenery. The climate is thought to be very salubrious. There are two inhabitants over ninety-one years of age, and more than twenty between eighty and ninety. The Kennebunk River, which forms the eastern boundary line, has several improved powers, and is navigable by means of a lock to Landing Village. Branch River bounds the town on the west, while the Mousam River divides the territory longitudinally into two nearly equal sections. The principal body of water is Alewives Pond, which is about three miles in circumference. The face of the country is quite level. The soil in the southern part is a clay loam, and in the northern part sandy."], [305, "KENNEBUNK. 297 A grant was made in 1643 by Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the original proprietor, to Lieut. John Saunders, and his son, Goodman Sanders, is supposed to have built the first house in town. Goodman Burke, also, is supposed to have had a house upon the seashore previous to 1653, the date of incorporation ; and Steven Bastom built one soon after. Both these were probably built for the accommodation of travellers passing from the settlements at Piscataqua and York to those eastward. The first permanent settlement was by William Larrabee and four or five companions in 1718, on the banks of the Mousam. A few years after ward a house was built on Great Hill, and two or more at the Landing. In 1748, the number of families was 25; at which time a meeting house was built at the Landing, being the first in town. Rev.

In 1688 the mills were burned by the Indians, and the place was deserted. In 1721, John Webber, Richard Boothbay and Samuel Sawyer built them houses ; but in Lovewell's war, commencing in 1722, the bitter, with Ebenezer Lewis, John Felt and William Wormwood, while raftino- timber upon Gooch Creek, were surprised and killed by a party of savages led by Tom Wawa, a Pequaket chieftain. About 1735, a large fortification was erected on Mousam River, called Fort Larrabee, which was torn down in 1762. It enclosed more"], [306, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 298 than an acre of ground. The Indians made several attempts to sur prise this fort, and once they were prevented only by the barking of Larrabee's dog.* Some of the inhabitants took part in the Louisburg expedition ; others served in the army in the vicinity of Lake George, in 1756-7, with General Abercrombie and others. In 1774, iron-works were erected on the island below the lower dam on Kennebunk River, and another furnace at the western end of the dam. The iron ore was brought from Saco, Maryland Ridge, and the western side of the Wells road. A grist-mill was erected the same year on the dam at the lower iron-works. Three salt-factories were also erected about this time, and were worked several years. Stone piers at the mouth of Kennebunk River, to improve the harbor, were built in 1798 and 1823, at a cost of $12,000. Shipbuilding re vived after the Revolutionary war, so that in 1798, there were 50 vessels owned upon Kennebunk River. In naval hostilities of this period, the French captured about 25 vessels belonging to citizens of Kennebunk, for which the National Government some years after ward received payment, yet have never paid the owners. Kennebunk sent into the army during the war of the Rebellion 168 men, of whom 30 died in service. Their monument is a marble slab, bearing their names, set in the wall of the town hall. This building is an excellent one, constructed of brick, and two stories in height. The buildings throughout the town are generally in good condition ; and among them are some which were erected very early in the existence of the town. Along the roadside at many points are noble elms and maples, many of them from fifty to a hundred years old. On the Mousam River near Alfred is a natural stone dam, with a fall of 45 feet. This is known as Great Falls, formerly Fluellen Falls. The entire fall in the Mousam from this point to tide-water, is 150 feet, affording several excellent water-powers. At the second fall above tide-water there is a sash and blind-factory, a saw and shingle-mill, and a machine-shop. The third is improved on the western bank by the Union Lace Co., and on the eastern by two twine-factories and a grist-mill. A short distance above is another twine-mill. At Varney's Falls, still further up the stream, is a lumber-mill. The power here is sufficient to drive 11,000 spindles eleven hours a day throughout the year. There are also several mills on the south side of the Kennebunk River, and on Branch River. The Mousam Manufacturing Co., at Kennebunk Village, produces a good article of leather board in large quantities. There are also a plough-factory and several ship-yards. Kennebunk is a port of entry and delivery of the U. S. customs. There were built in the Kennebunk District in the year ending June 30, 1880, ten vessels, whose aggregate tonnage is 2,576 tons.

Keiinebuilk Port, in the eastern part of York County, is bounded on the east by Biddeford, west by Kennebunk, north by THE CLIFFS, CAPE ARPNDEL, ME. Lyman, and south by the sea. Its area is 14,108 acres, exclusive of water. The Boston and Maine and the Portsmouth, Saco and Port land railroads cross the town about midway of its length. A branch is expected to be run to the port village from the former road by July, 1881. Its principal village is at the south-east angle, on two or three small but deep bays, known as Cape Porpoise Harbor. These are pro tected from the force of the ocean waves by a cordon of islands, of which there are sixteen within the town limits. Upon one of the outer most of these is Great Island Light, which marks the north side of the harbor entrance. The light-house is a stone tower, whitewashed, and connected with a one and a half story wooden dwelling, painted white. It shows a flashing white light, visible eleven nautical miles on an eastward arc. The custom-house of the Kennebunk District is situated in the village. The business centres are Kennebunk Port Village and Cape Porpoise Village. The principal body of water is Brimstone Pond,"], [308, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 300 some two miles long,in the western part of the town. The streams are the Kennebunk River, which separates it from the town of the same name ; Little River, next to Saco ; Batson's River and Smith's Brook, which, uniting, form a small harbor; and Goffe's Creek, emptying into the Kennebunk River. At the mouth of the latter is the principal harbor ; whose natural security is increased by stone piers a' its entrance. Fisheries and shipbuilding form the principal business at the sea board. Ten vessels were built during the last fiscal year within its limits and on the opposite shore of Kennebunk River. There are sev eral small saw-mills on the streams, and two saw-mills and a grist-mill run by steam-power. The town has four good granite quarries. The south-eastern part is rocky, but the soil for the most part is clay loam ; and both uplands and marshes yield good grass crops. The face of the country is moderately uneven. The eminence called Mount Scargery or Scargo is the highest land. The roads are kept in good condition, and there are pleasant woods of maple, oak and pine scattered over the town. Elm trees from twenty to a hundred years of age are frequently seen along the highways in the vicinity of the olden dwellings ; and in these dwellings are tokens of a time long past and of a thrifty present. The climate is regarded as favorable to longevity, there being some 30 persons over eighty years old. There is a mineral spring in town of some note, known as the Perkins Spring. Kennebec Port was made a town under the name of Cape Porpoise, in 1653, by the Massachusetts Commissioners. The inhabitants were driven off by the first Indian wars, and returning were re-organized in 1718 under the name of Arundel. In 1820, that name was changed to the one it now bears. The land titles came from Gorges and Rigby. The first permanent settlement was made in the south-eastern part of the town by William Seadlock and Morgan Howell, about 1630. The place is said to have been named Cape Porpoise by Captain John Smith, from his having encountered many porpoises off the cape. The court records for 1640 show that William Seadlock is presented by the grand inquest for allowing a man to get drunk on his premises. Mr. Seadlock also appears in the record of 1633 as complainant against one John Baker for opprobrious speeches against the minister and meeting, and for countenancing private meetings and prophesying to the hindrance of public assemblies. The church at Cape Porpoise appears to have been an independent body ; for when the Massachusetts Com missioners attempted, in 1653, to organize the government of the town, they were opposed by the church, and they therefore declared that body dissolved. From 1689 to 1719 there is a hiatus in the records, the Indian wars having mostly depopulated the town duriiic that period. There was a fort built upon Stage Island in 1689, and garrisoned by direction of Governor Andros ; but when he returned to Massachusetts, the troops deserted. The Indians soon made their appearance in large numbers, and the inhabitants either removed to the fort, or to the neighboring town of Wells. The fort was besieged until the provisions were almost exhausted, when Nicholas Morey, a lame innkeeper of the town, one dark night escaped from the island in a broken canoe. The second day the distressed inmates of the fort beheld a sail approaching. Presently she sent the contents of a swivel gun among the Indians, who instantly abandoned the siege and fled."], [309, "KENNEBUNK PORT. 301 The lame man had reached Portsmouth in safety, and brought his neighbors timely succor. Grants of fifty acres of land to new settlers were offered in 1719. Stephen Harding received a lot on condition that he and his heirs should maintain a ferry on Kennebunk River, and convey all inhabi tants of the town without charge. In 1627, feeling secure from the Indians, the inhabitants undertook to build a meeting-house, but the work went on slowly. In 1728 occurred the fourth great earthquake experienced sincet he settlement of the regions. The alarm it caused brought about a revival of religion, and the reformation of many; and in consequence of this, the church edifice was speedily completed. In 1745 the town sent a company under command of Captain Thomas Perkins to aid in the capture of Louisburg. The news of the battle of Lexington reached Cape Porpoise three days after its occurrence. Many citizens flocked to the army at Cambridge ; and at home meas ures were immediately taken to supply the town with ammunition ; a committee of safety was appointed, and a representative sent to the Provincial Congress. The town received but one visit from the enemy during the war. It was in August, 1782, that an armed English brig came into the har bor and took a schooner and sloop belonging in Newbury, Massachu setts. A citizen named Samuel Wildes, who was partly deranged, went out to them in a small canoe and ordered them to give up the vessels and leave the port. He was fired at and wounded in several places, but escaped to shore. The inhabitants soon collected on Trott's Island, and afterward passed to Goat Island, and a conflict ensued. A number of the English were killed, and the brig forced to leave the harbor without their prizes. Lieutenant James Burnham was the only one killed on the American side. The following are names of citizens who were captains in the army of the Revolution. Jesse Dorman was at Cambridge in 1776; Tobias Lord, at the surrender of Burgoyne, White Plains, Saratoga ; Daniel Merrill, Cambridge, 1775-6, Hubbardston, surrender of Burgoyne, and served until the close of the war; Joshua Nason, James Perkins, on North River, 1776-7. The following were lieutenants: James Burn ham, killed at Cape Porpoise fight, 1782 ; John and Tobias Lord, sons of Captain Tobias Lord ; Lemuel Miller ; Amos Towne was at Dor chester Heights in 1776. In the war of 1812, a fort was built at Kennebunk Point and a battery erected at Butler's Rock, commanding the entrance of the river. Several privateers were fitted out, some under Danish colors ; but most of them were captured by the enemy. The first church records in town are of the Congregational Church, and were commenced at about the time of the settlement of the Rev. John Eveleth, in 1719. In 1720, a house was built for his residence, which served also for a meeting-house and town-house. The first Baptist meeting-house was built in the upper part of the town in 1797. The town has now two Congregational, a Methodist, and a Baptist church. There are twelve schoolhouses, and the school property is estimated at $8,000. The town valuation in 1870 was $901,431. In 1880 it was $866,802. The population in 1870 was 2,372. In 1880 it was 2,405. The rate of taxation is 18 mills on half the valuation. Kent's Hill, a small village and post-office in Readfield,"], [310, "302 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Kennebec County. The excellent Kent's Hill Seminary, an educa tional institution under the patronage of the Methodists, is located here. Kezai* Falls, a village in Porter, Oxford County, also a post-office iu Parsonsfield, on the opposite side of the river KillgTieldl. is situated near the middle of the eastern side of Franklin County. It is 7 miles long from east to west, and b\\ miles from north to south. It is bounded on the north by Jerusalem Plan tation, west by Mount Abraham Township, south by Freeman, and east by Lexington, in Somerset County. Carrabasset River runs south ward through the town, and is joined in the southern part by the South Branch, coming from the west. The Carrabasset is extremely rapid, affording within the town at least twenty good and available powers for mills. The northern part of the town is very mountainous, and affords much fine scenery. The principal peaks in Kingfield are Vose, Black, Owl's Head, and Blueberry mountains. These belong to the group of Mount Abraham, which stands in the adjoining township on the west. The forest trees are principally rock-maple, birch and spruce. The principal sheets of water are Tuft's, Grindstone, and Dutton Ponds, having areas of 100, 10 and 50 acres respectively. The soil is sandy to a considerable extent, yet along the streams there are some excellent intervals. The principal crop is hay. Kingfield village is situated on Carrabasset River in the south-western part of the town. Kingfield has a lumber and shingle-mill, and a grist-mill. Other manufactures are carriages, rakes, axes, saw-horses, etc. The village is 20 miles from Farmington in a northerly direction. The station of the Sandy River railroad in Strong is about 12 miles distant. Kingfield was formerly Plantation No. 3, Range 1, of Bingham's Purchase, and was surveyed by Solomon Adams in 1808. Settlements commenced a year or two earlier, the pioneers being a Mr. Blanchard, from Weymouth, Mass., Rev. Nathaniel Gilbert, of Kingston, Eben Pillsbury, Solomon Stanley, Joseph Longley, Benjamin Foster, William Trash, Charles Pike and others. The town was incorporated in 1816, being named in honor of William King, the first governor of Maine, who was a large proprietor and a temporary resident. The Methodists, Free Baptists and Universalists each have a church in this town. Kingfield has three public schoolhouses ; and the school property is valued at $2,800. The village schools are graded. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $110,910. In 1880 it was $119,095. The population in 1870 was 560. In 1880 it was 454. King\"man is a new town in the eastern part of Penobscot County, on the European and North American railway, 66 miles N. N.E. of Bangor. It is bounded on the east by Drew Plantation, south by Webster Plantation, west by Mattawamkeag, and north by Mac wahoc Plantation in Aroostook County. The area is about 15,000 acres. The Mattawamkeag River runs through the midst of the town from east to west, where it receives the Molunkas Stream' from the north. The settlements are along the Molunkas road, and at the vil lage on the Mattawamkeag, near the centre of the town. There are here a large sole-leather tannery of F. Shaw & Brothers, a saw-mill for long and short lumber, one for .shingles, and a steam-mill making short lumber."], [311, "KINGS BURY. 303 The increase of the population has recently been considerable, and the town bids fair to become an important one. Kingman was origin ally No. 6 of Range 4, north of the Bingham Purchase. About 900 acres in the northern and eastern part belonged to the Waterson and Pray purchase. The remainder was granted to Camden, in Knox County, in aid of a bridge across Dutch Trap Stream. It was organ ized as McCullis's Plantation, July 4, 1859 ; and re-organized, March 28, 1866, under the name of Independence Plantation. It was incor porated as a town Feb. 1873, and named in honor of R. S. Kingman, of the firm of Shaw & Kingman. The town has two public schoolhouses, and the entire school prop erty is valued at $750. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $30,677. In 1880 it was $75,455. The population in 1870 was 185. In 1880 it was 546. Kill,SsSl)liry is situated in the south-western part of Piscata quis County, having Mayfield, in Somerset County, for its western boundary. Its other boundaries are the Piscataquis County towns of Blanchard, on the north, Abbot and Parkman on the east, and Wel lington on the south. The principal ponds are Kingsbury, 2 miles long by 1 wide, Foss, about 1 mile each way, and Tilton Pond, some what smaller. There are two fine Cascades in town, and the streams are well-stocked with speckled trout. The town is hilly, the principal rock is slate, and the soil, where cultivated, is mostly a clay loam, good for potatoes and grass. The trees usual in the region flourish here ; and the primeval forest still stands to such an extent that one road passes through it for 9 miles without encountering a single opening. There is a saw-mill and grist-mill, built in 1835 by Judge Kingsbury (now owned by the Hilton's) on the outlet of Kingsbury Pond. This stream forms the south branch of the Piscataquis River, while the north branch passes through the north-eastern part of the town. The stage-road from Athens to Moosehead Lake passes through Kingsbury. The vil lage is 10 miles from Dover, and the same distance from the station of the Bangor and Piscataquis railway in Abbot. The township was a part of the Bingham Purchase. It was lotted by Eleazer Coburn, Esq., and in 1833 was purchased by Hon. Sanford Kingsbury, of Gardiner, for the sum of $4,000. William Hilton and his brother the next year made openings, and in 1836 there were so many settlers that the town was incorporated under the name of its honorable proprietor. There are now a store, hotel, mechanic-shops, and the mills already mentioned at Kingsbury Village. There is a church organization of the persuasion called Buzzcllites. Kingsbury has two public schoolhouses, valued at $200. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $27,327. The rate of taxation in 1880 was one cent and six mills. The population in 1870 was 174. By the census of 1880 it was 198. Kittei*y forms the extreme south-western part of York County, and of Maine. It originally comprised, besides its present territory, that of Eliot, Berwick, South Berwick, and North Berwick, and was incorporated in 1647, as the plantation of Piscataqua. It is the first incorporated town in Maine. The territory of the Berwicks was set off in 1713, and Eliot in 1810. The first settlement was at the Point"], [312, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 304 about 1623. The town was a portion of the Mason and Gorges Patent, and many of the present titles came through Walter Neal, their agent ; who, before 1634, by grant or sale, had conveyed all the lands in the tract. During the Revolution, Kittery voted men and means, as they were required of her. Portsmouth Harbor was an important station and war-vessels and privateers were built and fitted out here. The harbor was fortified and garrisoned, both on the New Hampshire and Maine side. The quota for 1776 was 60 men, and a bounty of \u00a36 was paid by the town for each recruit. Fort McClary, situated on the western side of the island formed by Spruce Creek and the river, was garrisoned in 1812, and also in the war of the Rebellion. A monu ment to the memory of the townsmen who fell in the latter struggle is conspicuously located in Old Orchard Cemetery. Among the early inhabitants were Messrs. Jenkins, Jones, Lord, Mason, Paul, Spinney, Humphrey Chadbourne, Nicholas and Charles Frost, John Heard, John Andrews, Nicholas Shapleigh, Go wen Wilson, Thomas Spencer, John Fernald, William EverettT, Richard Nason, Thomas Withers, John Dennet, Robert Mendum, and James Emery. Eminent citizens of later times were John Cutts, first president of the New Hampshire Council ; Mark Adams ; General William Whipple, a signer of the Declaration of Independence ; Joshua T. Chase, and Sir William Pep pered, who commanded at the capture of Louisburg, \u2014 for which he was made baronet by the King. The family tomb of the latter is one of the curiosities of the town. Kittery is bounded on the north-west by Eliot, on the north by the latter and York, south-west and south by Piscataqua River and its harbor, and south-east by the sea. The town contains near 7,\u00b047 acres of land. The Isles of Shoals, which lie about 9 miles south of Kittery Point are divided by the line between Maine and New Hamp shire, by which the larger number belong to Kittery. Hog Island, the largest, has an area of about 350 acres, its greatest elevation being 57 feet above the sea. Smutty Nose has about 250 acres and an elevation of 45 feet. Star Island contains 180 acres, and its height is 55 feet. The surface of these islands is mostly gneissic rocks, but a thin soil in places. These islands were formerly and are still a great resort for fishermen ; but now, though many fish are still caught in the neighbor ing waters, they are chiefly taken into Portsmouth, whence they are sent fresh to all parts of the country. At one time previous to the Revolution the shoals contained from 300 to 600 inhabitants The islands at one time constituted a municipality called Appledore, and later, Gosport, and sent two representatives to General Court. There was a courthouse on Haley's Island, and once the General Court of Massachusetts convened there. Latterly the islands have become places of numerous resort in summer, and have several fine hotels. The mainland of Kittery is rocky and broken in the southern part, and moderately uneven in the northern. The soil yields well of the com mon crops. Navigation and shipbuilding furnish the principal busi ness of the town. Master William Badger built 100 ships here, and his son Samuel built 45 before his death in 1857. In 1782 the first 74 gun ship of the National government was launched here ; she was named America, and was commanded by John Paul Jones. She was shortly after presented to the French government in return for the"], [313, "KITTERY. 305 loss of one of their ships in Boston harbor. The government in 1806 purchased an island of 60 acres (now connected with Kittery village by a bridge) and has ever since made use of it as a navy-yard. Seavy's Island, adjoining, was also purchased by the government a few years ago for the same purpose. The islands are now occupied by numer ous shops and yards, in which 1,000 men are sometimes employed in the construction and repair of United States vessels. Many noted DISTRICT SCHOOL HOUSE, KITTERV, ME. vessels have been built here. The bridge connecting Kittery with Portsmouth was built in 1822, and is 2,230 feet long. The business of the town, other than farming, is chiefly found at Kittery Depot ; a half mile easterly at Kittery Village, whence a bridge leads to the Navy- Yard ; and at Kittery Point, a mile and a half east of the vil lage The first Congregational church of Kittery was organized in b ' 20"], [314, "306 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 1714, and Rev. John Newmarch was ordained pastor. The Spruce Creek church was organized in 1750, and Rev. Josiah Chase was or dained pastor. The First Baptist church in Maine was organized here in Kittery in 1652 ; the first Christian church in 1806 ; and the first Methodist society was formed about 1827. The town has now two Christian and two Methodist churches, one Congregational, one Free Baptist, and one Universalist church. A good public library has been recently established in the village. There are eleven schoolhouses in town including that of the High School valued at $17,000. The val uation of estates in 1870 was $622,523. The population at that time was 3,333. In 1880 it was 3,230,\u2014 and the valuation, $535,289. Kllig'htSVllle, a small village and post-office in Cape Eliza beth, Cumberland Couuty. KllOX, occupies a position in Waldo County half way between the Penobscot and Kennebec Rivers, 12 miles N.W. of Belfast. It is bounded on the north by Thorndike, east by Brooks, south by Mor rill and Montville, and west by Freedom. The area is 17,000 acres. The town is quite hilly, but without very high eminences. Half-Moon Stream, running northward to Unity Pond, is the chief watercourse. The soil is fertile, repaying well the labor of the inhabitants, who are almost exclusively farmers. The manufacturing consists of a lumber mill, tannery, carriage-factories, boots and shoes, etc. There are two villages, Foster's Corner, in the south-west part, and Knox Corner, in the north-west. The Belfast and Kendall's Mills stage-line runs through the town. The Belfast branch of the Maine Central Railroad has a station in the north-east part. The territory of this town was included in the Waldo Patent, of which Gen. Henry Knox became the owner; and at its incorporation, Feb. 12, 1819, it received his name. The settlement commenced about 1800. The Methodists and the Christian denominations have churches in the town. The number of public schoolhouses is nine. The school property is estimated at $2,000. The value of estates in 1870 was $218,392. In 1880 it was $2-18,608. The population in 1870 was 889. In 1880 it was 853. KnOX Coilllty is situated on the south-eastern side of Penob scot Bay, and includes its islands south of Isleboro, and west of Isle au Haut Bay. It was organized in 1860, being formed from Lincoln and Waldo, and named for General Knox, the friend of Washington, who was a resident of the county during the later years of his life. It contains thirteen towns, one city, and two organized plantations, viz. : Appleton, Camden, Cushing, Friendship, Hope, Hurricane Isle, North Haven, City of Rockland, St. George, South Thomaston, Thomaston, Union, Vinalhaven, Warren, Washington, Matinicus Isle Plantation, and Muscle Ridge Plantation. Rockland is the shire town. The St. George's River runs through the county in a general south course, dividing it into two nearly equal sections. On this stream and its branches, the outlets of a large number of ponds, are many water powers. The principal elevations of land are the Camden Hills,"], [315, "KNOX COUNTY. 307 extending from Thomaston through the western part of Rockland to the Penobscot on the north-eastern side of Camden. Of these, Mount Megunticook is 1,265 feet high ; Ragged Mountain, 1,230 ; Mount Pleasant, probably about the same height as the latter; Bald Mountain, 1,140 feet ; and Mount Battie, nearly 1,000 feet. Mount Hatchet, in Hope, is a considerable eminence, and another in Rockland, 558 feet in height, is known as Madambettox, Mathabesee, and also as Dodge's and Marsh's Mountain. The soil compares well with that of other counties, being generally fertile in the valleys and on the interior slopes, and sterile on the ridges and along the coast. St. George's and its neighborhood was one of the earliest points visited and occu pied by Europeans. In 1630, Leverett and Beauchamp, two English merchants, received by grant from the Plymouth Company, the terri tory lying between the Penobscot and Muscongus Rivers, extending north far enough to form a tract 30 miles square, or nearly 600,000 acres. This was first known as the Muscongus, and, subsequently, the Waldo patent, from having passed into the ownership of that family. This patent forms the basis of most of the land titles in Knox and Waldo counties. In 1694, Sir William Phips acquired a partial title to lands in the southern part of Knox County, by purchase from Ma dockawando, a famous chief of the Tarratines. The two block-houses which, by subsequent enlargements, became Fort St. George, were erected in 1719-1720. Lovewell's, or the \" Three Years' War \" with the Indians began in 1722 and continued into 1725. During this time she inhabitants of Knox County suffered greatly ; and in July of this year two Massachu setts commissioners held a conference at the fort with thirteen Indian chiefs. This was adjourned to Boston, where for a month the discus sion of the differences between them and the settlers in this region were discussed by the State authorities and two chiefs representing the tribe ; the Indians denying Madockawando's right to make a sale of land here as he had to Governor Phips. At length the chiefs were pacified by an agreement to establish trading-houses on the St. George's, where goods should be sold to the Indians at a slight advance on cost. This arrangement was known as the Duminer Treaty, and was ratified in the following summer by a large concourse of Indians at what is now Portland. It was at this epoch that we first hear of Samuel Waldo, a young Boston merchant, who, about this time, by inheritance and by subse quent purchase came into possession of nearly the whole of the Mus congus patent, all, in fact, of Knox and Waldo counties, except what is now included in the towns of Camden, Hope and Appleton. Thus Mr. Waldo became sole patentee of half a million acres, whose northern boundary was claimed by him to be but very little south of the site of Bangor. One of his first acts was to open the lime-quarry which was long afterward enclosed by the walls of the Maine State Prison, where he commenced the manufacture of lime for the Boston market, \u2014 thus being the pioneer of what has become a leading industry in the region. In 1735, Mr. Waldo contracted to deed to each settler a lot 40 rods wide on the River St. George, and running back so as to contain 100 acres ; the settlers on their part agreeing to build houses, and clear four acres of land on the lots occupied within two years. The first party consisted of 27 families of Scotch-Irish extraction."], [316, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 308 Among the names of these were Patterson, Boggs, Creighton, Starrest, Spear, Lermond, Mclntyre, Robinson, and Kallock, \u2014 still represented in these towns. Mr. Waldo in the same year rebuilt the saw-mill at Mill River ; in 1740, he erected a grist-mill at Oyster River, and erected a house for religious meetings. About this time he also located 40 lots on the western side of the river, on what is now Cushing, about 30 of which were at once occupied. In 1743 a settlement was effected in what is now Friendship (then Meduncook), by several families of English Puritan extraction. In 1744, an Indian war again visited the eastern regions, and the inhabitants again endured the horrors of savage warfare. In 1745 occurred the famous expedition which resulted in the capture of Louisburg. In the land force Waldo, who had some time previously become a militia colonel, bore the rank of Brigadier General. With the return of peace, prosperity again smiled upon the settlement. In 1753, General Waldo settled another colony of twenty Scottish families some two miles from the river on the western side. Anderson, Dicke, Crawford, Malcolm and Kirkpatrick are the names of some of them. They called their settlement Stirling, and the name still adheres to the locality. Again from 1754 to 1758 an Indian war raged in Maine, to the great distress of the St. George's settlers. With the fall of the French power in the north, the Indians realized that they could no longer contend with the English, and in the treaty with them which closed this war they acknowledged they had forfeited their lands, and all contention ceased. General Waldo died in 1759, and the larger part of this patent came into the hands of his son-in-law, Thomas Flucker, of Boston. At the breaking out of thejlevolution, the inhabitants of -this region were generally found on the patriot side. All signed the \" Solemn League and Covenant \" binding to non-intercourse with Great Britain until the Boston Port Bill should be repealed ; and in June, 1775, they formed a Committee of Safety and Correspondence. After the failure of the expedition against the British at Castine in 1779, General Peleg Wadsworth, the second in command of the land forces, had his headquarters as commander of the Eastern Department at Thomaston. It happened by the expiration of enlistments that he was at one time left with only a body-guard of six men, when his house was attacked in the night by twenty-five British soldiers from Castine. After i brave resistance the General was wounded and carried as prisoner to the British garrison at Castine. After being for some months in con finement there, he together with a companion in misfortune \u2014 Major Benjamin Burton \u2014 escaped during a severe thunder storm; and, crossing the Penobscot, quickly found safety among their countrymen. At the close of the war, there was much uncertainty in regard to land titles. Thomas Flucker, the heir of General Waldo, had espoused the cause of the king, and was therefore included in the act of pros cription. In a few years, such portion of the patent as had not been disposed of, came into the possession of Flucker's son in law, General Henry Knox. On resigning his commission as secretary of war in 1795, he removed to the mansion he had prepared in Thomaston. The mansion, to which Mrs. Knox had given the name, Montpelier, was opened with a grand feast, to which were invited all the neighboring inhabitants \u2014 rich and poor; and here he continued for the remainder of his life to dispense ttie most bountiful hospitality. Among his dis-"], [317, "LA GR.iNGE. 309 tinguished guests were Talleyrand and Louis Philippe. General Knox entered upon the development of his estate with energy. He com menced the manufacture of lime, erected mills, introduced new varieties of fruits and vegetables, and improved breeds of cattle and sheep. His extensive operations brought in many new settlers ; but his expensive establishment drew heavily on his income, and an ardent temperament sometimes involved him in unprofitable schemes, so that the great estate was after his death found to be insolvent. He died suddenly in 1805 ; and his remains now rest in the cemetery at Thomaston. In the war of 1812, the chief interest centred in the privateering on the coast and the importation of foreign goods in neutral vessels, \u2014 which having run the British blockade were transported across the country to Boston by ox-teams. In the war of the Rebellion, Knox County sustained her credit for patriotism and bravery. Major General Hiram G. Berry, who fell at Chancellorsville, was the most eminent among her sons in this period of our history. By the census of 1880, the amount of shipping owned in Knox County was 84,931 tons, having a value of $1,660,584. The amount of personal estate was $4,032,582 ; and of real estate $6,846,154. The population in 1870 was 30,823; and 1880, 32,862. KOSSlltll is situated on the north-western border of Washington County ; and is bounded by Topsfield on the east, unnamed townships on the north and south, and Carrol in Penobscot County on the west. Baskahegan Lake lies at the north-east corner, receiving Pleasant Stream, the principal water-course of Kossuth. This town was former ly No. 7, Range 2, north of the Bingham Purchase. It was incorporated February 23, 1876. It is 66 miles from Machias, and 42 miles from Calais, on the Topsfield and Lincoln road. The only manufactory at present is one lumber mill ; but the population will soon require others. Kossuth has two public schoolhouses, with a total school property of $800 in value. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $26,645. In 1880 it was the same. The population in 1870 was 119, with 27 voters. In 1880 the number of voters remained the same, but in the preliminary report, the population vv as massed with other places, and cannot there fore be given. La Gl'ailg'e, in Penobscot County, lies in the southern angle of the Penobscot and Piscataquis rivers, 28 miles north of Bangor. It is bounded on the east by Howland and Edinburg, south by Argyle and Alton, west by Bedford, in Penobscot County, and by Orneville in Piscataquis County, and north by Medford in the same county. The Bangor and Piscataquis railroad passes through the south-western part. On this road, near the middle on the western side of the town, is La Grange village. Hemlock Stream, the west branches of Dead River and of Birch Stream, and Hoyt Brook are the principal water-courses. The size of the township is about 9 miles in length, north and south, by 6 east and west. The surface is moderately uneven, with one considera ble elevation called Brimstone Hill. The forests are thrifty, and con sist of all the various trees common to the region. The soil is fertile, yielding excellent crops of hay, oats, wheat, corn and potatoes. The underlying rock is slate in many places. Dead Birch and Hemlock"], [318, "310 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. streams each have water-powers. There are two saw-mills, manufac turing long and short lumber and fruit-boxes and a grist mill. One of the saw-mills is driven by steam. Four trains daily pass through the village. The dwellings in the village and through the town generally convey the appearance of thrift, which the fertility and business of the town would lead one to expect. The town was incorporated February 11, 1832. There is a good Free Baptist church here, and a Union church newly erected. There are four public schoolhouses. The school property is valued at $3,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $154,425. In 1880 it was $202, 673. The rate of taxation is about 2\u00a3 cents on a dollar. The popula tion in 1870 was 622. In 1880 it was 721. Lakeside, a post office in Kennebec County. Lakeville Plantation lies in the extreme eastern part of Pe nobscot County, 75 miles E.N.E. of Bangor. It was formerly Number, 4 of Range 1. It is bounded on the north by Springfield and Carroll, east by the latter, west by an unnamed township, and south by Wash ington County. The area is about 70 square miles. Near the centre of the township is Upper Dobsis Lake (Sysladobsissis). South of this is a larger lake, Lower Dobsis, lying partly in the township southward. Others lying north and east of Upper Dobsis are Junior, Duck, Keg and Lombard ponds. These sheets of water vary from 2 to 10 miles in length, covering a large part of the area of the township. The outlets of these ponds furnish some water-power. There are two saw mills manufacturing long and short lumber. The surface of the town is quite uneven. Almanac Mountain is the highest; its summit being generally stated as 2,000 feet above the surface of the lake. The ledges are mostly of coarse granite. The soil is a gravelly loam, and fairly productive. Hay, wheat and potatoes are chiefly cultivated. The nearest railroad stations are at Mattawam keag and Kingman, each about 20 miles distant. The post-offices are Springfield and Carroll. Lakeville Plantation was organized under its present name Feb. 29, 1868. There are two public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $43,990. In 1880 it was $48,608. The rate of taxation is 9^ mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 108. In 1880 it was 136. Lamlbert Lake a post-office in the township adjoining on the west of Vanceboro, in Washington County. LaniOllie, in the southern part of Hancock County, emDraces the peninsula lying between Jordan's River on the west and Skilling Bay on the east. The area is about 11,000 acres. The soil is good, and could easily be made very productive. The inhabitants are chiefly devoted to coasting and fishing. The yearly catch by vessels from this town at the Grand Banks is stated at 8,000 quintals; of Magdalen herring, 100,000 boxes ; the aggregate market value of both being about $55,000."], [319, "LEBANON. 311 The post-offices are Lamoine, and North and East Lamoine. An object of curious interest is Blunt's Pond, which has a surface of 30 acres at a height above the sea of 300 feet. The colossal em bankment which surrounds it suggests the work of the mound-builders of the Mississippi Valley. It is situated upon a height of \" loess or bluff formation \" that extends in a northerly direction across the coun try. Along the seashore of this town occur extensive deposits of clam shells, in which human bones have been found. In one of these beds, a few years since, Capt. A. G. Berry found a brass kettle, an axe, and a stone file. Capt. Berry has also in his possession the account-book of the first settler, also that of Dr. Payson, and some of the French deeds executed by Madame Gregoree. One dated in 1788 is signed : \" Bartholomy De Gregoire. \" Maria Therese de Gregorie, nee de law the Cadillack.\" Lamoine was set off from Trenton and incorporated in 1870. It was named for Lamoine, an early French resident, who at one time owned a large tract of land west of Skilling's River. A colony of French made a transient settlement on Trenton Point at an early day, and two of the colonists, Delaittre and Desisles, remained permanent residents. According to the statement of Hon. W. King, the first settlement at Lamoine, formerly Trenton, was made in 1774 at Gillpatric's Point, by the individual whose name it bears. Captain Berry states that \" Capt. Isaac Gillpatric, with six sons and two daughters, from Biddeford, and a son-in-law, Edward Berry, from Londonderry, N. H., were the first settlers.\" Both these authorities say that the French came subse quently to Gillpatric. The two church-edifices of Lamoine both belong to the Baptists. The town has four public schoolhouses, and the school property is val ued at $5,200. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $142,449. In 1880 it was $148,333. The population in 1870 was 612. In the cen sus of 1880 it was 751. Lang* Plantation, in Franklin County, is situated between the towns of Rangley and Eustis, having Dallas Plantation on the south. Formerly it was Number 2 of Range 3. The Saddleback River, or Dead River, gathers some of its tributaries within the town. The plantation is 48 miles north-west of Farmington. The post-office is that of Eustis. The valuation in 1870 was $19,924. In 1880 it was $23,500. The population in 1870 was 36. In 1880 it was 31. LarOne, a post-office in Fairfield, Somerset County. Lebanon is situated midway of the northern side of York County, adjoining New Hampshire, and separated from it by the Salmon Falls River. It is bounded by Acton on the north, Sanford on the east, and North Berwick and Berwick on the south. Its area is about 26,000 acres. The township was granted and confirmed to Joseph Chadbourne, Nathan Lord, Joseph Hartt, Ichabod Goodwin, Edward Arnold, Elisha Plaisted, and 54 others, their associates ; and all hands are held by this title. No portion of the land in the township was ever conveyed by an Indian deed. It is said that no evidence exists of its ever having been occupied as a dwelling-place by"], [320, "312 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. the Indians, except possibly by a few families beside the pond at the extreme north-west corner of the town. The first settlement was chiefly in school district No. 1. The surnames of the first settlers were Farnham, Copp, Door, Hussey, Rines, Stevens, Blaisdell, Tebbetts, Kenney, Wallingford, McCrelis, Perkins, Corson, Burrows, Goodwin, Yeaton, Furbush and Co well, who appear to have come in soon after 1746. Two garrison houses were built in 1755. The origi nal proprietors were required by their charter to build a meeting-house, and settle and maintain a learned and orthodox minister for the inhabit ants, and build him a house. The meeting-house was erected in 1753, and the parsonage in 1759. In 1761 or 1762 the town hired Ezra Thompson to preach and teach school, and his labors in these depart ments appear to have been the first in town. The settlement was at first known as \"Towow \" or \" Towwoh.\" The town was incorporated under its present name in 1767. Thomas M. Wentworth, who became a resident of the town soon after 1771, was a leading citizen, and his son has been held in equal esteem. The surface of the town is com paratively level in the south-east, and in the north-west are extensive pine plains. The highest of several high hills bears the name of Went worth's Mountain. On the road leading from Berwick through West Lebanon Village to Acton, after leaving the flat land at the south, are .found many good farms and fine country mansions. The best farming 'land is probably on the \" Central Road,\" extending north-west and south-west through the midst of the town. There are also a large number of good farms in the easterly part of the town adjoining Sanford. Hay is considered the most profitable crop. The business centres are Lebanon Centre, East, North, South and West Lebanon, and Milton Three Ponds, on the lower Ol the ponds at the north-west ern boundary. Salmon Falls River, which forms the western boundary, furnishes a number of good water privileges, upon which, on the Lebanon side, are several saw-mills and one mill for wool-carding. Little River, in the south-eastern part of the town, also furnishes power for several saw-mills and a grist-mill. The Portland and Rochester Railroad crosses the southerly part of the town, and the Great Falls and Conway, a short distance at the north-western part. The chief natural curiosity of the town is \"Gully Oven,\" situated in a deep ravine. It is on the road from West Lebanon Village to Acton, and one and one-half miles northerly of the former. Six miles south of the cavern, during the old French war, the Indians captured a boy of eleven years of age named Philip Door ; and they spent the succeeding night in the Oven. He was detained many years, but finally returned and became one of the first settlers of Lebanon. He said that he was captured by the Indians in the forenoon as he sat astride of a fence singing a popular song of the period, \u2014 \" As sure as eggs are bacon, I'll go to Canada and wont return. Till Canada is taken,\" \u2014 which came true, sure enough. During the war of the Rebellion, Lebanon furnished what would be equal to 121 three-years men for the army. Besides these, many young men, residents of the town, at the first breaking out of the war enlisted in New Hampshire regiments, for which the tovyn never re-"], [321, "LEEDS. 313 reived credit from the authorities. The amount of bounties paid by the town was $40,000. Lebanon has a Baptist and a Congregationalist church, and two Free Baptist churches. There is a good academy at West Lebanon ; beside which there are in town nineteen public schoolhouses, valued at $4,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $524,575. In 1880 it was $425,050. The population at the first date was 1,953. In 1880, it was 1,601. Lee is a small town in the eastern part of Penobscot County, on what is called the \"Upper Route \" from Bangor to Calais, 60 miles from each city. It is bounded on the north by Winn, east by Spring- field, and west by Lincoln. Much of the land is of excellent quality', and bore originally a dense growth of the hard woods, with hemlock, spruce and pine. In the southern part of the town are several ponds, the largest being Mattakeunk (area, 1,000 acres) and Ware ponds, the head of the Passadunmkeag Stream. Lee village, the chief centre of business, is situated on Mattakeunk Stream, near the pond of the same name, where there is a good water-power. There are here two saw- mills \u2014 one a board, shingle and grist-mill, a tannery, and wheel, tin- ware, and furniture factories. Near the village is a good trotting park, where fairs are held. The nearest railroad station is that of the European and North American Railway at Lincoln village, 12 miles west of Lee village. This township was originally granted by Massachusetts to Williams College, by whom it was sold to parties living in Cumberland County. There was some defect in the titles, which resulted in prolonged liti- gation, retarding settlements and diminishing the prosperity of the town. The suits were at last decided by the Supreme Court of the United Stated in favor of the settlers. In 1824, when the settlement began, there was no road nearer than Passadumkeag, 28 miles below. Jeremiah Fifield and his wife were the first who moved in. The first mill was on the Mattakeunk Stream, at the point where the village now stands, and was erected in 1827. The town was incorporated in 1832, having at that time about 400 inhabitants. In 1845, the Legislature of the State incorporated the Lee Normal Academy, endowing it with half a township of land, which the trustees subsequently sold for about $4,000. This sum now constitutes a per- manent fund for the support of the school. The institution remains a monument of the sagacity and public spirit of those of the early settlers who were instrumental in its establishment. Public worship has also been valued and maintained from the first; and many of both sexes have gone out from this community bearing with them the good in fluences with which they had become imbued. The town has now Congregationalist, Universalist, Baptist and Free Baptist churches. The number of public schoolhouses is nine ; and the school property of the town is valued at $2,000. The valua tion of estates in 1870 was $139,343. In 1880 it was $109,953. The population in 1870 was 960. In 1880 it was 894. Leeds, in Androscoggin County, lies between Androscoggin River and Androscoggin Pond, sometimes called Wayne Pond. The"], [322, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 314 town is about 5 miles wide at the middle portion, and nearly 13 miles long. It is also about 13 miles from West Leeds to Lewiston Falls, and the same distance from Livermore Falls. On the west lies Turner and a small portion of Livermore ; the latter town and East Liver more are on the north, Wayne and Monmouth on the east ; on the south is Greene and the western part of Wales. The Androscoggin River forms the western line, and by a bend to the eastward, nearly two-thirds of the northern line. Androscoggin Pond, on the eastern side, is about 4 miles long and 3 wide in its greatest extent, and has an area of nearly 6 square miles. The town contains about 23,000 acres of land. The Androscoggin Railroad passes through the midst longitudinally. Three villages of the town,Curtis's Corner, Leeds Centre, and North Leeds, are on this road. West Leeds, the other village, is on the Androscoggin River, about midway of the town. The manufactories consist of a board and shingle-mill at the Centre; a saw-mill and grist mill at West Leeds, and a board and shingle-mill at Curtis's Corner. The streams are all small, Dead River being the largest. This stream is the outlet of a chain of ponds, of which Androscoggin Pond is the largest and last. It has the rare power of running either way at different times. Upon a sudden rise of the Androscoggin River, the flow sets back the current of Dead River into the pond. It sometimes flows into the pond for three or four days. The face of the county is diversified with hill and dale. North Mountain, Boothby Hill, Bishop's Hill and Quaker Ridge are the principal eminences, the highest being about 100 feet. Woodland, containing the usual trees of the region, exists in due proportion. The valleys of the larger streams contain much good interval, usually the best for cultivation ; yet the dark soil of the high land yields well and is the best for fruit, and less liable to frost. The town has several peat bogs, the largest of which contains about 300 acres from 10 to 30 feet deep. The surface of the bog is 75 feet higher than Dead River, and a ditch less 75 rods in length would drain it. The amount of fuel this might afford is immense. The territory was first called Littleborough from the Massachusetts family of that name, who were the largest proprietors. It was incor porated as the town of Leeds in 1801. A portion of Livermore above Dead River was annexed to it in 1802 ; in 1809 a strip half a mile in width, including Bishop's Hill, was set off from Monmouth and annexed; in 1810 the section known as Beech Hill was set off to Wayne, and in 1852 the south-east corner of Leeds was set off to Wales. The first settlers were Thomas and Roger Stinchfield, who removed their families to Dead River in June, 1780. The two brothers had be come acquainted with the vicinity in their hunts ; and the year be fore had raised corn and vegetables, and in the winter transported thither four goats and sundry household implements on the snow crust. They had also provided venison and maple sugar; so that their families were supplied with comfortable housing and subsistence at once. Other names of early families are Fish, Millett and Bishop. Several soldiers of the Revolution followed, of whom were Gilbert and Lothrop, Lead better, Lane, Lindsay, Pettengill, Turner, Morgan, Brewster, George, Cushman, and Robbins. The oldest inhabitant the town has had was Robert Gould, who died in 1868, aged ninety-nine years. The Jennings family of this town has given some able men to the"], [323, "LEVANT. 315 country, of whom may be mentioned Orville, an able lawyer in the Southwest, Roscoe G., formerly surgeon in the navy, later in resident of Arkansas. General Oliver O. Howard, well-known in the whole country, is a native of Leeds, together with his brothers, Rowland B., a minister and editor of ability, and Charles H., now publisher of \" The Advance,\" a religious journal in Chicago. The first religious meeting held in town was in 1794, at the request of Thomas Francis, a resident. In 1800 a Baptist church was organ ized, and Mr. Francis was ordained pastor. The Quakers formed an organization and erected a meeting-house about 1807, but the sect now appears to be extinct. The first Free Baptist church was erected about 1836, and the Methodists in 1851. The number of schoolhouses in town is twelve, and the estimated value of school property, $4,000. The value of estates in 1870 was $456,348. In 1880 it was $415,486. The population in 1870 was 1,288; in 1880 1,194. The rate of taxation is about one cent on the dollar. A number belonging in town rendered service in the war of 1812 ; and 161 were furnished to the national forces in the war of the Rebellion. Letter E. Plantation is situated in the south-western part of Franklin County. It is bounded east by Madrid, north by Sandy River Plantation and No. 3, and south by No. 6. The town ship is triangular in form, about ten miles in length from east to west, and 5 miles in width at the western and widest part. Sandy River and its branches drain the eastern part. It is on these in the south eastern part of the township that the settlements are located. Thorn Hill is the only elevation which has a well-known name ; but there are other considerable hill ranges. At the north-west corner is a group of ponds of which the largest are known as Benn's and Swift River ponds. There are other small ponds in the east. This plantation was organized in 1861. In 1872 a section of the eastern part of the town was annexed to Madrid. These contained all the largest bridges and interval farms, so that there are now in the plantation only six farms occupied by residents, and only eight polls. The forest trees are largely spruce and hardwood, with some hem lock and fir. There are plenty of ledges and bowlders to be found. The soil on the upland is generally good for hay and grazing. Two falls on a branch of Sandy River are worthy of mention for their beauty. The plantation has one schoolhouse, costing about $235. This serves for civil and religious meetings. The valuation in 1870 was $12,931. In 1880 it was $14,545. The population in 1870 was 93. In 1880 it was 27. Levant is an agricultural town located in the middle of the southern section of Penobscot County. It is 8 miles from Bangor, on the \" Avenue Road \" to Exeter. The surrounding towns are Corinth on the north, Kenduskeag and Glenburn on the east, Carmel and Hermon on the south, and Stetson on the west. The surface is uneven, yet without high hills. The soil is fertile, and suitably rewards the tiller. The thriftiness of the town is apparent to all who allow them selves the pleasure of a drive over its main roads. The Little Kendus-"], [324, "316 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. keag, or Black Stream, is the principal water-course, pursuing a widely winding way from west to east through the town. The powers on this stream are known as Wiggin'sMill, at Levant village, where there are board, shingle and lath machines ; Weston's Mills, at South Levant, where there are board, clapboard, shingle and lath machines, and a grist-mill ; on the Horseback Road, is a shingle mill ; White's Mill, at West Levant, where there is a board and shingle mill ; Emerson's Mill, in the west part of the town, where there is a saw-mill. Another local name for West Levant is \" Rogers' Stand.\" The first settlers were William and George Tebbets, and Messrs. Boobar and Knowland, who came in sometime prior to 1800. In 1801 Major Moses Hodsdon settled at what is now Kenduskeag Village, but was then a part of Levant ; where, in the following year, he erected a saw and grist-mill, three dwelling-houses, a store aud blacksmith-shop, which were the first framed buildings within the town. Major Hods don was largely engaged in surveying ; and his brothers soon followed him to this place, adding much impulse to business. The titles of the settlers to their lands were from William Wetmore, who had purchased a tract here of the Commonwealth in 1792. The plantation name was Kenduskeag, which it retained until its incorporation as a town, June 14, 1813. A corner, including the village of Kenduskeag, was set off 1852, to form a part of the new town of Kenduskeag. Levant has Baptist, Methodist and Union churches. The number of public schoolhouses is seven. The value of the entire school prop erty is $3,400. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $277,449. In 1880 it was $282,149. The population in 1870 was 1,159. In 1880 it was 1,076. LeWrlSt011 is practically the centre of Androscoggin County, and is nearly so geographically. It is situated upon the Androscoggin River, which separates it from Auburn on the west and south. Greene bounds it on the north, Webster and Lisbon on the east. The soil is largely a clay loam, but a gravelly loam on the high lands. The surface is quite hilly, but there are no lofty eminences. David's Moun tain, near Bates' College, and Mitchell's Hill are each nearly 500 feet above the sea, and are the chief eminences. The former has its name from Mr. David Davis, whose heirs have given a lot on its summit to the college for an observatory. It is near the valley at the falls of the Androscoggin, in which goes on the principal business of the two cities of Lewiston and Auburn, and its summit affords a wide circle of varied and pleasing landscape. The falls of the Androscoggin at this place furnish attractive views from several points. On the river road, about one mile above Barker's Mills and three miles from the falls, is a locality where a steep wooded hill comes down close to the shore of the river, which has here just come down the rapids at Boxer's Island, and beats its swells against a rocky shore, which at one point gives way to a sandy slope, forming a little beach. For the distance of a mile the scene is quite wild and beautiful. The place is variously named \" The Gulf \" or \" Switzerland\" according as reference is had to the water or to the hill features of the picture. Here, as in other parts of the town, the rock crops out. It is, in general, gneissic in its character, intermixed with some granite and an impure limestone. No-name Pond, situated near the eastern angle of the town, is the only consid-"], [325, "LEWISTON FALLS, LEWISTON, ME."], [326, "318 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. erable sheet of still water. It is about a mile long, and is half a mile wide at its widest part. The falls, which furnish the water-power of Lewiston, are the third on the river, reckoning from tide-water, which is about 20 miles distant. The descent is formed by a ledge of gneiss and mica-schist which crosses the river diagonally, and is so extended as to form the bed of the river above and below the falls. The rock is above water level on the eastern shore, and on the western rises to a little hill ; while in the stream it forms two islands of over half an acre of extent. The natural fall is about 38 feet, which is increased to 50 by the excellent stone dam. There is a tradition that a terrible catastrophe happened at these falls to the Indian tribe dwelling on the river above. The story varies considerably, but the most credible version is that two scouts in search of a party of Indians who had carried a girl away captive, encountered at the falls, near night, an Indian who had just landed from a canoe, and was gathering material for a fire at a point just above the falls where it would serve as a beacon. They killed the Indian ; and suspecting a large body of Indians to be coming down the river in canoes, they quickly retired to a hill below but in view of the falls, and in a line with the point where the Indian was preparing the beacon. Here they kindled a fire, and lured by its deceitful ray beyond the point of safety into the swift rapids, they were unable to escape, and all went over the fall and perished . The territory comprising the city of Lewiston was included in the Pejepscot Patent, granted to Thomas Purchase and George Way in \"t0o2. On the death of the two original proprietors, most of the tract became the property of Richard Wharton, a Boston lawyer. To make his title secure, he obtained in 1684 a deed of this territory from Warumbee, and five other sagamores of the Anasagunticooks. On Wharton's death his administrator, in 1714, sold the claim to Thomas Hutchinson, John Winthworth, Adam Winthrop, John Watts, David Jeffries, Stephen Minot, Oliver Noyes, and John Rusk for \u00a3140. These persons were commonly styled the Pejepscot Proprietors, and their lands were called the Pejepscot Claim. Its limits were finally fixed on the western side of the river at Lewiston Falls, and on the eastern side so as to embrace about two-thirds of what is now the town of Leeds. On the east side of the river there was a difficulty in regard to the boundary rights of this and the Kennebec purchase, both on Merry meeting Bay and at, the extremest northern part of the Pejepscot Claim. By the action of the courts of Cumberland and Lincoln the entire line was settled in 1814. The grant under which Lewiston was settled was made by the proprietors to Jonathan Bagley and Moses Little, of Newbury, Massachusetts, in 1768. The territory commenced at the falls and extended 5 miles up the river, from thence in a north east course 5 miles, from thence in a south-east course 4 miles, from thence on a southern course to Androscoggin River, and from this point up the river to the falls, whence it started. The conditions were that Bagley and Little should settle 50 families in as many houses \u25a0within the limits before June, 1774, and should also clear a road to Royalsborough (Durham) to meet one to be constructed to Topsham. The houses were to be 16 by 20 feet, and of 7 feet posts. The name of the town was to be \" Lewiston.\" The first settler was Paul Hildreth, who, in the summer of 1770, built his log cabin just below"], [327, "LEWISTON. 319 where the Continental Mills now stand. The first ferry in town was established by him about three-fourths of a mile below the falls. Mr. David Pettingill, the second settler, came in the fall of 1770. Law rence J. Harris, third settler, came and erected the frame of the first saw-mill in the fall of 1770, and brought his family in the spring. He owned several lots by gift from the proprietors and by purchase ; the most valuable one being the mill lot at the falls, and comprising 100 acres. He built his house on what is now known as Lower Main street, and on the site now occupied by Garcelon Block. After his death one of his sons sold the mill lot and 15 acres of land to Colonel Josiah Little. Amos Davis moved from New Gloucester to Lewiston in 1774. He was a farmer, surveyor, and shoemaker. He sun eyed a part of the town for the proprietors in 1773, and made a plan in 1795. He gave the ground for the old burying-ground on Sabattus street, and erected at his own expense a small building within its present en closure, Tvhich was occupied some years as a meeting-house and school house. He was a leading member of the Society of Friends, and a very exemplary man. His son David was the first male child born in Lewiston. Israel Herrick, Jesse Wright, and Jacob Barker came in 1774. James Garcelon came in the following year, and soon after settled at what has since been called Garcelon's Ferry. His father was Rev. Peter Garcelon, who came to this country from the Isle of Guernsey, England, when about thirteen years of age. James was a member of the first board of selectmen. His son J;.mes was for many years a Baptist clergyman; William was one of the first merchants in town, was engaged in lumbering, and also in shipbuilding in Free port. Josiah Mitchell came in 1776. and Jonathan Hodgkins in 1777. James Ames came in 1785, carrying on the business of blacksmithing in connection with farming. Previous to this the people had been obliged to go to New Gloucester for blacksmith's work. He also kept a ] ub lic-house for many years. Dan Read came in 1788. He was subse quently one of the board of selectmen for twenty-six years, chairman of the board for twelve years, town-clerk fifteen years, representative to the General Court of Massachusetts in 1804-5, and representative to the Legislature of Maine in 1820, 1823 and 1825. He was also the first post-master of Lewiston, to which office he was appointed in 1795 by Washington, a position which he held forty years, lacking three months. He died in 1854. Ebenezer Ham, grandfather of Colonel Ham, came in 1789. Lewiston was incorporated as a town in 1795, and as a city in 1801, and its government organized 1863. Jacob B. Ham was the first mayor. Only three persons who were residents of Lewiston are now known to have been in the Revolutionary war. These were David Pettengill, who died in the army, Benjamin Pettengill, son of the former, and Joel Thompson. After the close of the Revolution a num ber who had served in the war settled in Lewiston. In the war of 1812-15, the town was more numerously represented in the army. Oliver Herrick raised a comjjany in this and the adjoining towns, which started for Lake Champlain in January, 1813. A part of them were shortly ordered on board the Growler, and took part in the dis astrous action of July 2, 1813, in which the Growler and the Eagle surrendered to the enemy. In September, 1814, the regiment raised in this vicinity, under the command of Colonel Walter R. Blaisdell, of"], [328, "320 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Lewiston, was ordered out, but went into camp at Pittston on the Kennebec, and then returned. A small number were drafted from the two companies from Lewiston,\u2014 the North company, under the com mand of Captain Nathaniel Sleeper, and the South company, com manded by Captain George Williams,\u2014 remaining in service for some months. In the war of the Rebellion, Lewiston furnished two com panies for the 1st Maine regiment. These were commanded by N. J. Jackson and Silas B. Osgood. Jackson was promoted to the command of the regiment and Lieutenant Jesse T. Stevens succeeded to the captaincy. The regiment started for Washington on the 1st of June, and was stationed in that city during its term of service. Colonel Jackson was subsequently promoted to be brigadier-general. Edward Ilsley, a cadet from West Point, in the summer of 1861 recruited a company in Lewiston for the Fifth Maine regiment. Lieutenants Knowlton and Nye also recruited here a large proportion of two com panies for the Tenth regiment, becoming captains of companies F and K, respectively. After having passed through several hard-fought campaigns, the regiment was mustered out in May, 1863. Captains Knowlton and Nye soon after recruited two companies for the Twenty ninth regiment, in which Captain Knowlton was commissioned major. The regiment was in the Red River campaign under General Banks, then returned and took part in the series of battles in the Shenandoah Valley, where in September, 1864, Major Knowlton was mortally wounded. Company A of the Twenty-third regiment, largely recruited in Lewiston, was employed in Maryland and Virginia on guard-duty. The city furnished a large number of men for company D, Captain William R. Ham (Thirty-second regiment), reaching the seat of war in season to take part in the battles of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, and Cold Harbor, \u2014 where on the 3d of June, Colonel Ham was mortally wounded. Few, if any, regiments left the State which did not not contain some representative of Lewiston. Only 16 of the 1,158 soldiers credited to this city were drafted. During the war aid was furnished to 765 soldiers' families, at an expense of $31,970.26 ; and for bounties there was paid the sum of $100,275. The monument erected in the park soon after the war to the memory of the fallen brave was executed by Frank Simmons. It has a square granite base, 10 feet in height, surmounted by the figure of a soldier in bronze, heroic size. On the faces of the base are bronze tablets bearing the names of the 112 officers and soldiers who fell in the struggle for lib erty and union for America. The park in which the monument stands is not far from the mills, and is near the centre of the city. It contains about 10 acres of grassy turf, divided by broad, smooth walks. Around it are several fine buildings, both private and public. Bates Street, on the upper side of the park, is notable for its large and pleasant dwellings, and the elegant Baptist church of brick and granite. Opposite this, separated from the common by Spruce Street, is the Episcopal church, of the same ma terial ; while on Pine Street, directly' opposite at the other, or eastern end, northern side of the park, is the large and handsome Congregational church. On the same street, a little further west, and fronting on the park, is the De Witt House, an imposing building of brick. It is wholly occupied as a hotel except the lower rooms on Franklin Street on the western side, which are occupied by the offices of the Franklin Com-"], [329, "LEWISTON. 321 pany, and the Union Water-power Company. On Park Street, on the west side of the northern part of the park, is the city building, a noble structure of brick and granite, in partially gothic style, but having a mansard roof. The leading feature of the building is the large halTon the side next the park, which is 80 by 165 feet in dimensions, and has seating capacity for 2,500 people. The entire cost was above $200,000. Numerous shade trees of the various kinds, though young, ornament the park and many of the streets. Another important public work is the water-works for supplying the city with water. These are on the reservoir system. The water is pumped into the reservoir 220 feet above the river, and thence distributed through the pipes. The power used in this instance is that of the fall ; and the river is also the source of supply. A marked feature of the city proper is the sev eral canals leading the water from the river to the different mills. The bridges spanning these, the river and railroad crossings, number above two dozen, several of them being of iron. The healthiness of the inhabitants of the city proper is further provided for by an excel lent system of sewerage. The city is lighted by gas, by the Lewiston Gas-Light Company. The oldest of the manufacturing corporations until recently in operation in the city is the Lewiston Falls Manufacturing Corns any, making woollen cloths, which was organized in 1834, and com menced operations the same year. Its capital stock was $80,000, for which sum the property was sold to the city to afford power for the water-works. The mills are now leased. The Franklin Company was incorporated in 1847. It owns the brick-mill building on the bank of the river between the mill just mentioned and the falls, occupied as a grain-mill and by D. Cowan & Company, as a woollen-factory, the Lincoln Mill, the DeWitt House, several shops and other buildings, and several hundred acres of land in about the more thickly settled parts of the city. Its capital stock is $1,000,000. The Union Water power Company was organized in 1878, to manage the water-power which had been the property of the Franklin Company^. It owns the water-power property of the Androscoggin River in Lewiston, includ ing dam, canals and shore-rights, Auburn Lake, and the water-rights of two or more of the Rangeley Lakes, letting its power to the numer ous mills at a uniform rental. Its capital stock is $400,000. There are six corporations engaged in the manufacture of cotton. The Lincoln Mill, owned by the Franklin Company, commenced manufact uring in 1846, and is the oldest cotton-mill in the city. It consists of one building of brick, and has 21,744 spindles. Other factories are these : the Bates Manufacturing Company, with a capital stock of $1,000,000 ; the Hill Manufacturing Company, capital stock, $1,000,000 ; Continen tal Mills, $1,500,000 ; Lewiston Mills ; Androscoggin Mills, $1,000,000 ; Lewiston Bleachery and Dye Works, $300,000; Lewiston Machine Company, $100,000. The Continental Mills has the largest number of spindles, viz., 70,000. It employs 1,200 operatives, \u2014 900 females and 300 males ; and its monthly pay-roll and disbursements in Lewiston amount to $40,000. It manufactures 17,500,000 yards of brown sheet ings annually. The mill is of brick, five stories high, with a mansard roof, and contains eight acres of flooring. The total annual produc tion of cotton cloth by these factories is upwards of 50,000,000 yards. Other manufactories are the Lewiston Bleachery and Dye Works, 21"], [330, "322 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Lewiston Machine Company, Lewiston Gas-Light Company, D. Cowan & Company (woollens), Cumberland Mills (woollens), R. C. Pingree & Company's saw-mill, Lewiston Steam Mill Company (lumber), Bar ker's Mills (saw-mill) a file-factory, the Morton, Ham, and Tarbox grain-mills, loom-harness, belt and roll, seed, last, paper-box, boy's coat and confectionery factories, two carriage and sleigh factories, sev eral carpentry and machine shops, etc. The total amount of cap ital invested in manufactures is near $7,250,000. The total number of spindles in the cotton-mills is 291,806. The number of setts of wool en-machinery is fifteen. The consumption of cotton in the last year was 23,123,253 pounds, or about 53,000 bales. The number of females employed in the factories is 4,500 ; the number of males, 3,000. The total annual disbursements in the city of the manufactories is $2,880,000, or $240,000 per month for all purposes. The city has two savings banks, and two national banks. The Maine Central Railroad connects it directly with Portland on one hand, and Bangor on the other ; the Lewiston and Auburn branch railroad connects it with the Grand Trunk road ; the Androscoggin branch connects it again with the Maine Central at Brunswick, and the Farmington branch forms the only railroad connection with Franklin County. In the account of a manufacturing city like Lewiston, some history of this industry seems to be in place. The first saw-mill, as before stated, was built by L. J. Harris in 1770-1, near the falls, and was burnt about 1785. Some three years later he put in a grist mill, probably the first in Lewiston. Colonel Little in 1809 put up a building on the same site, which was used for a saw, grist and fulling mill and carding-machine. The mill was burnt in 1814, was rebuilt, and stood until about 1850. The Water-power Company who had bought land and water privileges of Colonel Josiah Little and others, in 1851 built a saw-mill at the head of the falls, and excavated a canal to supply the power. Captain Daniel Holland leased the mill, but it was burned in 1852. It was rebuilt, and in 1856 leased to S. R. Bearce & Co. Its site is now occupied by the City Water-works. In 1865 S. R. Bearce & Co. built a large steam-mill at a cost of $60, 000 on the margin of the river, above the station of the Maine Cen tral railroad. It employs about 200 men. A steam-mill built at Barker's Mills in 1847 by \"Read, Small & Co., at a cost of $7,500, was burned in 1852, and rebuilt the same year. In 1859 it was purchased by James Wood & Co., and removed to the shore of the Androscog gin River, about one-half mile above the Maine Central railroad station. In 1860 a company was formed with a capital of $50,000 (since doubled) and incorporated under the name of Lewiston Steam Mill Company. The company owns about 35,000 acres of woodland on the upper waters of the Androscoggin and its tributaries. In 1775 Jacob Barker built a grist-mill at Barker's Mills, and some two years later a saw mill. These mills were rebuilt once or twice by his son, and once (about 1836) by his grandson. About 1800 a saw-mill was built on the rips opposite Boxer's Island, which was burned about 1812. There was at one time a saw-mill on the Stetson Brook, which was removed to Auburn. About 1800, Colonel Joel Thompson, Captain Isaac Cot ton and Captain Joseph Dill erected a mill at the outlet of No-name Pond, where they manufactured ship-timber. In 1819 Colonel Josiah Little procured the services of Mr. Dean"], [331, "LEWISTON. 323 Frye, of Brunswick, to aid in carrying on his carding and fulling-mill. This was burned in 1829, but in 1830 the woolen-mill now standing was built; where some time after they began the manufacture of satinet. Larger capital being required, a charter for the Lewiston Falls Manufacturing Company was obtained from the legislature in 1834. This was the first charter for manufacturing purposes in Lewis ton. The corporators were John M. Frye and William R. Frye, sons of Dean Frye. A brick building was added in 1836 ; but a heavy spring freshet in 1837 undermined the wall, causing the building to fall into the river. The manufacture of cotton in Lewiston was begun soon after 1836 by Mr. Ephraim Wood, who manufactured cotton warps and batting. Mr. Joseph B. Harding succeeded Mr. Wood, and about 1844 put in three cotton looms, and wove the first cotton cloth manufactured in Lewiston. Mr. Harding removed to Yarmouth, and about 1850 the building was partially destroyed by fire, and the remainder removed to make room for the present brick grist-mill build ing near the falls. In 1836 the Great Androscoggin Falls Dam, Locks aud Canal Company was incorporated with a capital of $100,000. The company owned the water-power of the Androscoggin at Lewiston, to gether with a large amount of land in the vicinity on both sides of the river. In 1845 the name was changed to \" Lewiston Water-power Company,\" which increased the extent and value of its property until 1856; when the newly-formed Franklin Company, with a capital of $1,000,000, succeeded to the ownership. With the industrial growth of Lewiston her educational institutions have been multiplied and developed. The Maine State Seminary was incorporated in 1856, with an endowment by the State of $15,000. In 1863 a collegiate course of study was instituted, and the name of the institution changed to Bates College, in honor of Ben j. E. Bates, of Boston, its most munificent patron. From him, and by his aid the college has received $100,000, while a similar amount was a few years ago promised by him on condition that the friends of the college raised an equal sum within five years. Rev. O. B. Cheney has been president of the institution since its foundation. The college graduated its first class in 1867. The Nichols Latin School is the preparatory school for the college ; and the busings of the two institutions are located near each other. The college ha thirteen free scholarships. A theological de partment was institulea, in connection with the college, in 1870, having before been located in New Hampshire. The college has a library of 6,000 volumes, a theological library of 2,000 volumes, and society libraries of near 2,000 volumes. There is another library in town con taining about 8,000 volumes, which is available to all citizens by the payment of a small annual fee. The \" Lewiston Journal \" was the first newspaper published in the city, the first number having been issued May, 1847. It was published bvWilliam H. Waldron & Co., Dr. Alonzo Garcelon being partner with Mr. Waldron. Nelson Dingley, Jr., purchased an interest in it in 1856, and a year later he became the sole proprietor. The \" Journal \" is now recognized as one of the ablest, as it is one of the best patron ized paper in the State. Besides the weekly, the establishment pub lishes a daily journal of three editions. A younger brother, Frank L. Dingley, is associated in the management. Mr. Dingley (senior pro prietor) was governor of Maine in 1873 and 1874, but declined a"], [332, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 324 re-election; and in 1881 he was elected a member of Congress. Mr. Waldron in 1872 started the \"Lewiston Gazette,\" which he pub lished until his death in 1881. It is a newsy and interesting sheet, conservatively democratic in politics. It is now bi-weekly, being issued Tuesday and Friday. Other papers and periodicals of the city are \"The Bates' Student,\" published monthly by the students of Bates College; the \"Maine Independent,\" issued every Saturday, by Weeks & Stetson, and devoted to literature and humor ; the \" Maine Messen ger,\" a religious sheet, published monthly, by N. C. Dinsmore; and \" Le Messager,\" published every Thursday, by L. J. Martel & Co., which is devoted to the interests of the French inhabitants of the city. The land about the falls was originally quite rough, marked by deep gullies, and sandy knolls, with abundance of clay on the slopes, which have supplied and are still supplying many bricks ; but the hand of improvement has rapidly subdued the rudeness of nature ; and lawns, and thriving shade trees fill most of the spaces between the dwellings and other buildings, many of which are large and elegant. Among the larger residences may be noted that of Hon. William P. Frye, member of Congress sinee 1871, of Colonel J. M. Frye, J. L. H. Cobb, Esq., several on Bates and other streets. The Roman Catholics have two churches in the city, one of them of superior beauty. The Congre gationalist society also have a fine edifice, previously referred to. The Universalists have a fine church overlooking the park. The church of the Baptist society is an elegant building, and the Episcopal church near by is a substantial edifice. The Methodists have two churches, one of wood, the other of brick ; and the Free Baptists have also one of brick and one of wood. The Society of Friends have a small but neat and elegant little meeting-house on College street. The schools of Lewiston are noted for their excellence. They are graded according to the best system, and the school buildings in the rural as well as in the thickly settled parts are creditable to the city. The number of public schoolhouses is thirty ; and the value of the school property belonging to the city is $178,000. The valuation of real estate in Lewiston in 1870 was $8,813,629. In 1880 it was $9,930, 407. The rate of taxation in 1880 was '0024 on the dollar. The popu lation at that date was 13,600. In 1880, it was $19,086. See Auburn. LeXingTOn is situated on the western side of Somerset County, 25 miles north-west of Skowhegan, on the stage-line from that place to Flagstaff. The town is bounded on the north by Highland Plantation, east by Concord, south by Emden and New Portland, and west by Kingfield in Franklin County. The area is about 28,000 acres. The surface generally is moderately uneven. The highest sum mits are Gilman Pond Mountain in the south-west part, and Peaked Hill on the eastern side, rising from West Range Mountain, a broad elevation which covers the eastern border nearly the whole length of the town, and continues into the townships north. Upon the southern part of this elevation lies Spruce Pond. Butler Pond lies in the north west, Judkins Pond in the west, Indian Pond in the south-west, and Gilman Pond in the south. Sandy Stream and Alder Brook are the chief water-courses. The town has two saw-mills manufacturing long and short lumber."], [333, "LIBERTY. 325 The principal crop is hay Lexington was incorporated March 4, 1833. The Free Baptists are the most active denomination in the town, the number of public schoolhouses is seven, having an estimated value of $500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $77,897. In 1880 it was $58,421. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 43 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 397. In 1880 it was 322. Liberty lies in the south-western part of Waldo County, 16 miles W.S.W. of Belfast, on the stage-road from that city to Augusta. The outline of the town is of diamond form, having its longest axis north and south. Montville bounds it on the south-east, Searsmont lies at the eastern angle, Palermo on the north-west and west, Wash ington and Appleton in Knox County, on the south-west and south east. The greatest length of the territory is about 8 miles, and the width, 6. The surface is much broken by rocky eminences, of which the highest is Haystack Mountain. Others are Coon Mountain and Bowlin Hill. The soil is sandy in some parts, while in others, especially in the valley, it is a clay loam, of much fertility. Excellent crops of hay, grain, apples and potatoes reward the labor of the farmer. The town is noticeable for its numerous large apple orchards. St. George's Pond, in the northern part of the town, has an area of 2 square miles. Steven's, Cargill's and Mud Pouds are the other sheets of water. The principal streams are the Sheepscot, which crosses the north-western part of the town, and the St. George's, which is the outlet of the St. George's, Steven's and Cargill's Ponds. Liberty Village, situated at the northern border of the town on the outlet of St. George's Pond, is the chief business centre. There are here an axe-factory, a foundry and machine-shop, two tanneries, five saw-mills, manufacturing long and short lumber, and a grist-mill, water-wheels, carriages, cultivators, horse rakes, cabinets and coffins, saddles and harnesses, bootj and shoes, etc. At South Liberty are two lumber-mills. The nearest railroad station is at Belfast. Liberty is within the limits of the Waldo patent. It was incor porated January 31, 1827. Among the valued citizens of this town have been Messrs. J. W. Knowlton, T. Copp, J. C. Knowlton, William Sanborn, W. H. Hunt, W. R. Hunt, and others whose full names are not readily obtained. There are Methodist, Christian and Baptist societies in the town ; the last having a good church edifice. There is a high-school sustained in the village district. The number of public schoolhouses is seven, and their value, with appurtenances, is estimated at $3,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $193,819. In 1880 it was $264,757. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2\u00a3 per cent. The population in 1870 was 907. In 1880 it was 970, Limerick is a prosperous town in the northern part of York County, 25 miles from the seaboard. It embraces an area of about 15,500 acres, or about 24 square miles. The township was enlarged by act of legislature in 1870, when a tract of about 350 acres was an nexed from \"the adjoining town of Limington. The town is bounded on the north by Cornish, east by Limington, south by Little Ossipee River, which separates Limerick from Waterboro, and west by New field and Parsonfield. The town is part of Francis Small's purchase from the Pequaket chief, Captain Sunday. The town was first settled"], [334, "326 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. in 1775. The settlers came from the seaboard towns of York County, Newbury, Mass., and a few from Limerick, Ireland, \u2014 wherefore, on the incorporation of the town in 1787, it received the name of Limerick. James Sullivan, subsequently governor of Massachusetts, was a pioneer of the town. The surface is uneven and hilly, with good soil. The declivities of the hills are best for tillage, while the lowlands are excellent for hay. The usual crops are cultivated, with, perhaps, a larger proportion than usual of apples ; while grapes and cranberries yield a good return. The rock formation consists principally of a coarse granite. Stroul's Mountain, at the extreme north-east of the town, is the highest eleva tion. The principal business points are Limerick village, near the centre of the town, and Hollandville, about 2 miles to the north-east. The manufactories consist of a steam-power furniture manufactory, a tannery which turns out about 600 hides per week, a clothing factory at the village, and at Hollandville two woolen factories, one of which produces the celebrated \"Holland blankets,\" and the other woolen cloths to the value of about $150,000 worth of goods annually. There are also grist, shingle and lumbermills on the same stream, Brown's Brook, and on Staple's and Fogg's brooks, and on the Little Ossipee River, which bounds the town on the south. The public buildings consist of three churches, a town-hall and an academy. The town-hall is an elegant brick building, 40 by 60 feet in ground dimensions. The basement is used for commercial purposes ; and above are two commodious halls, and rooms for the town-officers. The Rev. Edward Eastman was the first pastor of the Congrega tional church, having been ordained over it in the year of its organiza tion. Later pastors have been the Rev. Charles Freeman, Rev. Albert Cole, Rev. Charles Packard, Rev. Philip Titcomb, and Rev. Thomas M. Lord. The Baptist church was organized in 1796, Elder Ebenezer R. Kinsman being ordained its first pastor. Among his successors have been Elder Joshua Roberts, four years from 1831 ; Rev. Henry A. Saw telle, ordained July, 1858 ; Rev. Asa Perkins, 1870. The Free Baptist church was organized in 1822, with Rev. Elias Libby as pastor. The church was re-organized in 1835, when Rev. A. R. Bradbury, a graduate of Bowdoin College, was settled as pastor. His successors up to 1854 have been Rev. William P. Chase, Elder David Manson, Elder Keene, Revs. D. H. Lord, James Rand, and Horace Wellington. In the war of the Rebellion, the quotas of Limerick were promptly filled, and no drafted men went from the town. Of her soldiers in this war the most distinguished are H. II. Burbank, Arthur Bnrbank, Mal colm Burbank, Samuel H. Libby, Frederick Libby, William Barker, Charles Cobb, Horace Favor, Gardner Libby, John Key, John Connor, Francis Sawyer, George Gore, Jefferson Stimpson, Frank Libby, Henry Bradbury, Edwin Clark, Joseph Hill, Thomas P.

Limerick has ten public schoolhouses, valued at $4,000. The valua tion of estates in 1870 was $392,637. In 1880 it was $365,362. The population in 1870 was 1,425 ; in 1880 it was 1,253. Limestone lies on the eastern border of Aroostook County,"], [335, "LIMINGTON. 327 near the north-eastern angle of the State. It is on the stage-line from Fort Fairfield to Van Buren, 56 miles north of Houlton. It is bounded on the north by Pleasant Ridge Plantation, south by Fort Fairfield, west by Caribou, and east by the town of Grand Falls in New Bruns wick. The principal streams are Limestone River and Greenlow Brook. The first runs entirely through the town from north to south east, furnishing several water-powers. On these are two saw-mills manufacturing long and short lumber. There are also two starch fac tories. The highways are kept in very good condition. The nearest railroad connections are those of the adjoining towns of Caribou and Fort Fairfield, or at Limestone on the St. John's in New Brunswick, all about equally distant. The surface of the town is rolling, and the principal rock is lime stone. The soil yields well of potatoes, wheat and oats. The first are the chief crop, finding a market at the starch factories in the town. Maple, birch, beech, spruce, pine and cedar form the forests. Limestone was incorporated February 26, 1869. Among the first settlers were Benj. Eastman, Barry McLaughlin, Gen. Mark Trafton aid Geo. A Nourse. The religious societies in the town are the Free Baptist, Christian and Presbyterian. There are six public schoolhouses, six lots of land reserved for the schools ; the total value of school prop erty being $2,100. The value of estates in 1870 was $27,647. In 1880 it was \u00a376,583. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 11 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 263. In 1880 it was 655^. LimilljSrtOn, one of the most northerly towns in York County, is bounded on the north by Baldwin, east by Standish, south by Hollis and Waterborough, and west by Limerick and Cornish. The Saco River forms the boundary line of the town on the entire north and east, while the Little Ossipee separates it from Waterborough on the south. There are several small ponds ; of which the principal one, situated on the north-east part of the town, is Home Pond. The soil is fertile, and the usual crops are cultivated. The surface of the town is much broken, and there are several lofty eminences, the chief of which are Veasie, Meserve, Moody and Maloy mountains, so called, and Crockett's Hill. Granite is abundant about the falls on the Little Ossipee. The water-powers are numerous. Nason's Falls, on Little Ossipee River, fall 60 feet in the distance of one-fourth of a mile. Three miles further down the stream are Chase's Falls, which have a descent of 35 feet in 40 rods, \u2014 the width of the river being 160 feet. At Nason's Falls there are shingle, stave and grist-mills; at Chase's Falls are saw, box and shingle-mills ; on the outlet to Home Pond are saw and grist-mills ; upon Salmon Brook an a grist-mill and a tannery, and on Kellog Pond is a saw-mill having a clapboard and shingle machine ; at Steep Falls, on the Saco, at the north-east angle of the town, Union Falls, near by, Limington Falls, a mile below the last,. are saw and other mills for wood-working. The principal village is Limington, at the centre; other points are North, East and South Limington, and Nason's Mills. Stages run daily from the village to- Steej) Falls, a distance of about 5 miles, connecting there with the Port land and Ogdensburg Railroad ; also, through South Limington, Bonny Eao-le, and West Buxton, connecting with the Portland and Rochester Railroad at the Saco River Station ; also connecting at the latter place"], [336, "328 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. with stages for Saco and Biddeford. The town was a part of Captain Francis Small's purchase from Captain Sunday, a chief of the region in 1668. In its earlier settlement it was known as Little Ossipee Plan tation, which name it continued to bear until its incorporation under its present name in 1792. In 1798 a tract of about 2,000 acres was annexed from Little Falls Plantation (Hollis); and in 1870, about 1,500 acres of land with the inhabitants thereon, constituting about one twelfth the valuation, was set off from Limington and annexed to Limerick. The first settler was Deacon Amos Chase, who removed here and commenced a mill in 1773, at the location known as Chase's Mills, at the mouth of the Little Ossipee River. Ezra Davis and Jonathan Boothby followed him in 1774, and John McArthur and Joshua Small in 1775. Eminent among later residents have been Abner Chase, Wingate Frost, Simeon Strout, Isaac Mitchell and Arthur McArthur. The first Congregational church was organized in 1789. The first church was built in 1793, on the site of the present house ; it was enlarged and rebuilt in 1835. The present first Free Baptist church was built in 1852. The number of men furnished for the army in the war of the Rebellion was 153. The sum paid out for war expenses was $51,150, for a portion of which, however, the town was reimbursed by the State. The Limington Academy was incorporated in 1848. Its chief founders were Arthur and James McArthur, Rev. J H. Gannon, Dr. -Samuel M. Bradbury, Gideon L. Moody, and Isaac L. Mitchell. Among its valued teachers have been Rev. Jonathan Atkinson, Rev. David Boyd, Hon. Samuel Tappan, Isaac Mitchell, Arthur McArthur, Esq., James Frost, Shadrach Boothby, Rev. Westcott Bullock, Thomas Gilpatrick, and Richard Meserve, M.D., The town has sixteen public schoolhouses, valued at $2,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $567,808. In 1880 it was $408,573. The population in 1870 was 1630; in 1880 it was 1431. ' LillCOlll lies on the eastern side of Penobscot River, about midway of Penobscot County. It is on the European and North American Railway, 45 miles N.N.E. of Bangor. Lincoln is bounded on the north-east by Winn, east by Lee, and south by Enfield, Lowell and Burlington. The Penobscot River separates it on the west and north-west from Mattamiscontis and Chester. Its area is 57,600 acres. The surface of -the town is much broken, and back from the river it is quite rocky with slate ledges and granite bowlders. The soil is of average fertility, and about one half the territory is under cultivation. There was formerly a heavy growth of pine, but what now remains of the forests is chiefly spruce and hemlock. There are within the limits of the town no less than 15 ponds. The Cumbolasse series of seven in the northern part supply at Lincoln Centre, on their outlet near the Penobscot, two excellent water-powers. The Mattanawcook series, lying across the middle of the town, supply the power for several mills at Lincoln village. The Coldstream series, consisting of five ponds lying near the southern border, furnish some small powers on their connecting streams. The largest of these ponds is Long Pond in the northern part of the town, having an area of some 400 acres, while two of theMattanawcook series, and three of the Coldstream ponds arc of nearly equal size. The manufactures of this town consiu of long"], [337, "LINCOLN COUNTY. 329 and short lumber, spools, leather, meal and flour, marble and granite work, and others usually found in small villages. About the year 1825, Israel Heald, John Carpenter, Alfred Gates, Benjamin Hammond, Stephen Chase, Humphrey Merrill, Ira Fisk, and others became residents of what is now Lincoln. It is supposed that there may have been some settlers earlier than these. Not far from the above date that portion of the territory not already sold to settlers was purchased by Governor Enoch Lincoln. Those who located on the Lincoln purchase were mostly from Oxford County, while those in other parts came from New Hampshire. The first mill appears to have been on the Mattanawcook Stream, where the lower village now stands. The construction of the military road to Houlton, which passed through here, gave the settlements an increased impetus ; and this village, being quite central for the lumbering operations of the period, became quite a rendezvous for lumbermen. Lincolu has churches of the Methodists, Congregationalists and Baptists. The number of public schoolhouses is eight, and the school property is valued at $3,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $343,177. In 1880 it was $365,295. The population in 1870 was 1,530. In 1880 it was 1,659. LillCOlll Comity occupies a middle place on the coast of Maine in respect to population, and no county of equal territory has so many harbors and havens. It is much cut up by arms of the sea and poncl-like rivers, but there are no great variations of altitude in the surface. Damariscotta River occupies nearly the middle line of the county, extending from north to south. East of this and parallel thereto is the line of Muscongus Bay, its extension inland as Broad Bay, and Medomac River. Parallel on the west is the Sheepscot River, with its excellent harbor. This county is bounded on the east by Knox County, west by Sagadahoc and Kennebec, and north by the last, Waldo and Knox, and south by the ocean. Lincoln County was established in 1760, at the same time with Cumberland County. The easterly line of Cumberland was then the westerly line of Lincoln. \" From tho time of its formation until the erection of Hancock and Washington Counties in 1789, Lincoln ex tended over quite three-fifths of the territory of the province.\" Its westerly line was ' from Small Point north-westerly upon Casco Bay to New Meadows River, and up said river to Steven's carrying place at the head of said river, and up said river 30 miles ; then north two degrees west on a true course to the utmost limit of the province.' Its north was Canada, its east Nova Scotia, and its south the ocean. Hancock County came across Penobscot Bay and river, and took in nearly the whole of the Waldo patent. In 1799, the organization of Kennebec took four-fifths of what remained after the formation of Hancock. Lincoln then continued undisturbed until 1827, when it parted with six towns to form Waldo ; and it had an equal run of time again, down to the organization of Androscoggin and Sagadahoc, in 1854, when the former received three towns from it, and the latter was made entirely from it.\" In 1860 (the centennial of Lincoln County), Knox County was organized, taking from her nine more towns, leaving the parent county with but 17 towns and a plantation to her name. In still earlier time this region had been claimed by France as a part"], [338, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 330 of her territory of Acadie ; later, it was known as Sagadahoc Territory ; and in 1665, the Duke of York (subsequently James II.), to whom it had been granted by the King, erected it into the County of Cornwall, \u2014 New Dartmouth (Newcastle), and, later, Pemaquid (under the name of Jamestown) becoming the seats of government. At the outbreak of King Philip's war, in 1675, the settlements of Cornwall, scattered over a wide extent of country, embraced some 300 families. Under the prudent management of Abraham Shurt, the chief magistrate of this county, a larger degree of amity had been main tained with the Indians than in other parts ; and the inhabitants of this region did not suffer so severely during the first year of the war as those in the westerly settlements. In the second year, however, Old Cornwall was likewise swept with the besom of destruction ; and thence forth until 1700 the settlements were deserted, or the inhabitants who remained were in terror of savage attacks, with only brief intervals of repose. In 1688, the County of Cornwall was entirely depopulated and desolated by the Indians under the lead of Moxus. Sir William Phips, first governor of Massachusetts under William and Mary, was desirous of doing something, if possible, to recover from the domin ion of the savage the land of his youth ; and in 1692 he built in place of Fort Charles, which had been destroyed, a fortification of stone, naming it Fort William Henry. In 1696, M. Iberville, with a force of French and Indians, entered the harbor and invested the place, and by means of artillery succeeded in forcing its surrender. It was not until 1729 that the permanent re-peopling of Old Corn wall commenced. At this time Col. David Dunbar, who had been commissioned surveyor-general of the King's woods, and deputy-gover nor in the eastern parts of New England, repaired Fort William Henry, also re-naming it Fort Frederick. He set vigorously at work to settle the county. To actual settlers he made grants of a homestead of 10 or 12 acres, and 100 acres of farm land. The settlers brought in by Colonel Dunbar were largely Protestant English, with some Scotch and Irish Presbyterians ; and by his aid the Presbyterian church became established as the prevailing phase of religion in this county until after the Revolution. At the same time with the formation of the county, was incorporated Pownalboro', its shire town, which was named for Thomas Pownal \u2014 at that date governor of Massachusetts. His birth-place was Lincoln, England, a city famous for its antiquity and its noble cathedral ; and thus Governor Pownal appears to have been further complimented in the name of the new county Lincoln County has 180 public schoolhouses, and her school prop erty at the close of 1879 was valued at $89,250. The valuation of the county in 1870 was $6,857,610. In 1880 it was $6,634,693. The population in 1870 was 25,597. In 1880 it was 24,809. LillCOlll Plantation, in Oxford County, has the New Hampshire line for its western boundary, and is the second plantation west of Rangeley. It is about 40 miles N.N.W. of Bethel, and 20 miles east of Colebrook, N. H. The Magalloway River runs through the midst of the township southward to its junction with the Andros coggin, near Umbagog Lake, 10 miles distant. In the eastern part is Lincoln Pond, whose outlet, with Abbott Brook on the western side"], [339, "LINCOLNVILLE. 331 are tributaries of the Magalloway, and the principal streams of the township. Other ponds are Parker Hill and Bean. The moun tains are quite numerous, and consist of Aziscoos, Observatory, Half Moon and Deer mountains, and Parker and Emery hills, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 feet in height. The rock is chiefly granite. The soil is loam, with hard pan below. Maple, birch, spruce and fir con stitute the forests. Hay is the crop chiefly raised, finding a ready sale with the lumbermen. This town is the principal line of summer travel for Parmachene Lake, a great hunting and fishing resort. Aziscoos Falls are the most striking natural curiosity. Their height is variously estimated from 200 to 300 feet. There are many other beautiful cataracts that have as yet no name. This plantation was formerly No. 5, Range 2. It was organized under its present name in 1875. The first settlements were about 50 years ago. In 1860 the plantation constituted a thriving farming com munity, but by the depression of the lumber business since 1870, the population became reduced in 1875 to four families. It is now in creasing. Lincoln plantation furnished 8 men for the Union cause during the war of the Rebellion. The plantation has a library of nearly 500 volumes. Singing-schools, picnics and balls furnish entertainment suited to the various tastes. Religious meetings are held in the schoolhouse. The school property of the plantation is valued at $200. The valuation of estates in 1!.) was $21,366. In 1880 it was $17,972. The rate of taxation ii . \u25a0 latter year was about 13 mills on a dollar. The population in 1 . . J was 258. In 1880 it was 52. LillCOlllville forms the south-eastern point of Waldo County, being about 7 miles in length and 4 in width. It lies on the western shore of Penobscot Bay, 12 miles south of Belfast, and is on the stage line from Bangor to Rockland. Lincoln was formed of the plantations of Ducktrap and Canaan. It is bounded by Northport and Penob scot Bay on the north-east and east, Searsmont and Belmont on the north-west, Hope on the south-west, and Camden on the south. Nearly the entire border of the town is covered by hills or ponds. The high est is Peaked Mountain, standing on the eastern line and partly on Northport, which has an altitude of about 800 feet. The other most notable eminence is Muddy Mountain, lying at the extreme western part of the town. Pitcher Pond extends along the north-eastern line, lying partly in Northport. Its outlet, Ducktrap River, is the prin cipal stream in the town. Andrew's Pond lies near the centre of the town, and Fletcher Pond in the western part. The closely-connected ponds, named Lincolnville, Canaan and Hortoii, in the south-western part, cover a large area in this town and in Camden. Ducktrap Stream has a pond surface of about 2,800 acres, and the fall on the stream is 300 feet in 3 miles. The principal power is about 20 rods above Ducktrap bridge, and 40 rods from high-water mark. A canal could be made with a small outlay to conduct the water below the bridge, where factories could be built close upon tide-water, where vessels could lie beside them. This river, with feasible improvements, could be made to increase its power to be equal to carrying 75,000 spindles. McCobb Stream, Gould, Kendal and Andrew's Ponds each"], [340, "332 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. furnish some power ; and each of the three last have a mill. The town has six lumber mills, a grist mill, a tannery, several lime and granite quarries, the last material being of a superior quality. There are also manufactured here in small quantities tinware, boots and shoes and carnages. The surface of the town is generally broken, rocky, boggy and mountainous. The villages are Lincolnville Centre and The Beach, the latter the same as Lincolnville post-office. The nearest railroad connections are at Belfast and Rockland, each about 12 miles distant. The Boston and Portland steamers touch at the Beach. Lincolnville was incorporated June 23, 1802. John Studley and a Mr. Wilson commenced a residence in the town in 1774, and were the first settlers. The churches are two Methodist and one Baptast. The number of public schoolhouses is fourteen. The value of the entire school property in the town is $9,989. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $436,956. In 1880 it was $409,296. The population in 1870 was 1,900. In 1880 it was 1,706. Llnekin, a post-office in Lincoln County, LinneilS, in Aroostook County, lies south-west of Houlton, their opposite corners touching. New Limerick bounds it on the north, Hodgdon on the east, and Oakfield plantation on the west. The head waters of the Mattawamkeag and Meduxnekeag rivers are found in the town. Meduxnekeag Lake lies in the north-western part of this town, and portions of New Limerick Lake lie on the northern border near the east. There are several other ponds in the various parts. The principal streams are the South Branch of the Meduxnekeag River in the northern part of the town, and Beaver Brook running southward to the Mattawamkeag. Linneus village, near the centre of the town, is also the centre of business. Linneus has two saw-mills ; one of these and a grist-mill being near the Meduxnekeag Lake, on its outlet. The old \" Military Road \" passes through the town. The nearest railroad station is at Houlton, 9 miles from the village The northern part of the town is somewhat hilly and rocky, but southward of this the sur face is gently undulating. The soil in most parts is a light loam, and of an excellent quality and well adapted to grazing and crops. Pota toes, hay and wheat are chiefly cultivated, though from 80 to 90 bushels of corn to an acre have sometimes been produced. In the north-west ern part limestone of an excellent quality is found in abundance. Magnetic iron ore is quite plentiful in some parts, and affords beauti ful cabinet specimens. Linneus was incorporated in 1836. It was originally granted by Massachusetts to endow a professorship of botany ; and \"was therefore named for the most renowned of botanists. The first settler was Daniel Neal, who removed hither from New Brunswick in 1826. In the following year it was surveyed into lots. Colonel Moses Burleigh, who settled here in 1830, was a captain in the militia of Maine in the war with Great Britain in 1812. He was stationed at Belfast with his company when the British ascended the Penobscot to capture the United States corvette \"Adams,\" then undergoing repairs at Hamp den. He represented his district in the Massachusetts Legislature sev eral years, and, after tie separation of Maine, was for several years in"], [341, "LISBON. 333 its legislature. Linneus has two inhabitants above 90 years of age, and several nearly that. The Baptist and Methodist societies each have churches in Lin neus. The number of public schoolhouses is seven. The school prop erty of the town is valued at $2,250. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $117,917. In 1880 it was $151,349. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 15 mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,008. In 1880 it was 917. LiSDOn is the most south-easterly town of Androscoggin County on the eastern side of the Androscoggin River. That stream, however, by a bend to the eastward forms the line of separation be ween Lisbon and Durham, on the south. On the east of it lie Topsham and Bowdoin ; Webster bounds it on the north, and Lewiston on the west. The town contains nearly 12,000 acres. It lies about 8 miles south-east of Lewiston Falls, and 10 north-west of Brunswick. It has no ponds, but Sabattus River runs through it from north to south, and Little River forms the larger part of the eastern boundary. The surface of the town is little varied by hills and valleys ; but a broad elevation called the Ridge extends into it at the north-west ; con tinuing southward to Durham, except where it has been cut through or washed away by the rivers ; and the streams have wrought large and small gorges along their courses. The soil is of clay, gravelly and sandy loams, with rich intervals along the streams. There is a con siderable extent of pine, interspersed with spruce and hemlock on the plains, with deciduous woods on the upland. The fertile and easily cultivated soil, and its proximity to the markets of Lewiston and Auburn, render it an important agricultural town. Its own villages of Lisbon Factory and Lisbon Falls, also, having a manufacturing population, afford a considerable market. Both are on the Androscoggin railroad, a branch of the Maine Central, by which they have easy com munication with Lewiston and Brunswick. The town is also rich in its water-powers. Little River on the south has two, not utilized at present ; on the Androscoggin, at Lisbon Falls (the second falls from the sea) is the large woollen-mill of the Worumbo Manufacturing Company, incorporated in 1864, and having a capital of $250,000. This factory employs about 100 males and 70 females, There are two buildings strongly built of brick. The amount of power used is 150 horse power. The annual production is about 120,000 yards of all-wool beaver cloth. Near by is the saw-mill of the Androscoggin Water- Power Company, manufacturing annually from three to five million feet of lumber, and employing 30 men and boys. The capital stock is $50,000. A short distance below it on a canal, is a grain-mill belonging to the same company. Only about 350 horse-powers of above 5,000 at this point are used. Sabattus Pond, about five miles long and two wide, with an average depth of 30 feet, is the source of Sabattus River. The latter is near seven miles in length, about half of which is in the town of Lisbon. In this distance there are five powers. The first or upper power is occupied by number one of Farwell's Mills, and a saw-mill. The first manufactures cotton shirtings. Its number of spindles is 3,136 ; and its annual production is about 500,000 yards. The number of operatives is upwards of 50, about two-thirds being males. The second power is occupied by an excellently built brick-mill 346"], [342, "LISBON FALLS, LISBON, ME."], [343, "LISBON. 335 feet long, 52 wide, and three stories in height, and having a working capacity of 12,000 mule spindles. This is number two of Farweli's Mills. Captain E. M. Shaw is the agent for all these mills. The next power below is occupied by the Farnsworth Manufacturing Company, incorporated in 1864, with a capital of $100,000, with W. F. Milliken as treasurer. The building is of brick, and there are six sets of ma chinery. The production is about 222,700 yards of \u00a3 goods, mostly repellant cassimeres. The number of operatives is, males 41, females 56. The fourth power, next below, where there is a fall of 12 feet with a good wooden dam, is at present unoccupied. There is another power a short distance below, also unoccupied. There was a cloth-mill erected on Little River as early as 1806, but it has been long out of existence. John Mayall in 1808 erected a wooden building for a woolen mill on a power just above the bridge at Lisbon Village on the Sabattus, oc cupying it until 1822, when it was purchased by Horace Corbett as a satinet-mill until 1850, when he quit the business. In 1860 it was refitted by J. F. Hirst, who manufactured repellants there until 1863, when he removed to Sabattusville and erected a brick-mill. John Robinson immediately took this old place, and manufactured flannels until 1867, when he removed to Massachusetts. The mill was then sold to N. W. Farwell, who has changed it into a cotton mill. A short dis tance below on what is known as Moody's privilege, a grist-mill was built on the east side of the stream as early as 1800 by Gideon and Abel Curtis, when what is now called \" Lisbon Factory \" was called \" Curtis' Mills.\" William Batchelor afterwards built a mill for making 6cythes just above this mill, and carried on the business for several years. The first mill on the west side was built about 1804 by Gideon Curtis, and was afterward owned by Nathaniel Gerrish, Esq., who carried on the lumber business. He was a justice of the peace, and served as school committee, and in other town offices. He sold the mill property to Joseph Moore. Both these have finally come to the ownership of N. W. Farwell, and have been improved by him in the manner previously described. Besides these, Abner Coombs built a mill at \" The Plains \" in 1804 ; and in 1839 a company from Fall River erected a cotton-mill just below where Farnsworth's Mill now stands, but it was burned in 1840, before any machinery was put in. Cephas Farnsworth came here from Norridgewock in 1823, and carried on a carding and dressing-mill for some years previous to 1845. His son Josiah carried on a saw-mill previous to 1863, when Benjamin B. Farnsworth, a son of Cephas, formed a company and built the present Farnsworth Mill in 1864. At Lisbon Falls (formerly known as Little River \u2014 from the stream just below) were at one time, from 1790 to 1800, six large sawmills, a corn and grist-mill, and a carding-mill. The logs were sawn at these mills and the lumber conveyed by teams to tide water at Topsham and Cathance (now Bowdoinham). The French troubles of 1800, the embargo and war of 1812 following in succession, obliged the owners to relinquish the mills and the business, resulting in their dispersion to other parts. The Indians are said to have called these falls, Anmecar.rjin, sig nifying much fish. Thomas Purchas of Brunswick had a fish-house here about 1650, carrying on the business of catching and curing salmon for the London market. The first settler was probably a Mr. White, who lived in a log-house on the road to Webster Corner, and"], [344, "336 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. afterward purchased White's Hill. Then Russell Hinckley settled a short distance beyond White, and Joseph Hinkley near by. Lisbon was formerly a part of the town of Bowdoin, which was a part of the Kennebec Purchase. Lisbon was incorporated under the name of Thompsonborough in 1799. It was so named in honor of the Thompson family, of Topham, who were large owners in what was then known as Little River Plantation. The name was changed in 1802 to the present one. Little River Plantation (now Lisbon Falls) was a part of the Pejepscot Purchase, being a gore lying between Androscoggin, Sabattus and Little rivers, and was annexed to Lisbon in 1808. In 1840 a portion of the territory was set off from the north ern part forming a new town by the name of Webster. The first ferry was established at Southwest Bend above Bend Island in 1799, by John Dean. In 1810 one was established below the island, and both continued running until 1817 when a bridge was built. In April, 1810, this bridge was carried away. James Sawyer, William Green and Lemuel McGrey were on it at the time, and were carried down the river 400 rods or more, and were taken off by two men in a batteau. The bridge was rebuilt the same season, and in 1846 was again carried away; and a ferry has been the means of cross ing ever since. Prominent in business or in town affairs in the early part of the present century were Abraham Whitney, Samuel Tilton, Jabez B. Fletcher, Merrell Jordan, Ebenezer Fellows, Joseph Langden, William Wise, William Coombs, John Raymond, Jacob Gould, Thomas Roberts, John Woodward, Stephen and James Whittemore, John Smullen, Calvin Cowen, Increase Blethen, William Neal, Henry Moulton, James W. Purinton, William Bucknam, William Bickford, True Woodbury, Samuel Nichols, Richard Doan, Ephraim Jordan, Nathaniel Herrick, and others whose names are mentioned nearly as often. Major John Rowe came about 1817, and lived on Rowe's Hill, dying in 1822. He was a soldier of the Revolution, and was also in service during the French troubles of 1799 and 1800. He kept a diary during the Revo lution. Abijah Metcalf served under John Paul Jones during the Revolution, coming to Lisbon about 1787. Daniel Green went into the army of the Revolution when sixteen years of age. Of the present business men should be mentioned John 6. Tibbits and Edward Plum mer, to whom belongs the credit of developing the water-power at Lisbon Falls. Seeing that the projected Androscoggin Railroad would render this available, they associated themselves with Oliver Moses of Bath, an enterprising capitalist, and have become the founders of the present manufacturing business of the place, yet in its infancy. The town has a Methodist and Baptist church, and two Free Bap tist churches. There is a small circulating library at the Falls and another at the Factory, and each place has a hotel. There are fourteen school houses in town valued at $10,000. The estates were valued in 1870, at $971,474. In 1880 it is $1,115,760. The population at tho first date was 2,014. In 1880 it is 2,641. Litcllfield is the most southerly town in Kennebec County. On the north and north-east it is bounded by West Gardiner, the Cob bossee Contee stream forming the boundary line for most of the dis-"], [345, "LITTLETON. 337 tance. Monmouth forms the western boundary for the northern part, and Wales in Androscoggin County for the southern part. Bowdoin and Richmond in Sagadahoc County lie on the south and east. Pleas ant Pond connected with the Cobbossee Contee, separates it from the latter. The Purgatory Ponds lie on the north-west side, adjoining Monmouth, furnishing water-power for several mills. These are at Litchfield, Village, or Purgatory Mills, and comprise an excellent grist mill and a hoe and fork factory. The post-offices are Litchfield, South Litchfield Litchfield Plains and Litchfield Corner. The surface of the town is uneyen, but not greatly broken. The highest eminences are Oak Hill and Neal's and Lent's hills. From their tops may be seen some charming views. The Purgatory Ponds in the western part of the town are the members of a chain of nine ponds, whose outlet is into the Cobbossee Contee. Loon Pond is a beautiful sheet of water. There are several attractive glens and cascades in the town. The soil is well suited to agriculture, and yields good crops of hay, potatoes, corn, wheat, etc. Much attention has been given to fruit culture, also. The annual fairs held at Litchfield Plains are among the best town shows in the State. Litchfield Corner is the seat of Litchfield Academy, founded in 1845, where many excellent teachers have been educated. There is also a public schoolhouse and several fine residences. The plantation name of the township was Smithfield, from two brothers named Smith, who, together with a Mr. Tibbetts, were the first settlers. Others of the early settlers were the Emersons, Met calfs, Hutchinsons, Lords, Potters, Neals, Owens, Dennises, Snows, Rogers, Jewells, Robinsons, and John and Daniel True, whose descend ants have ever been prominent in the town. The land titles are from the Plymouth Company. The town was incorporated under its pres ent name in 1795. In 1859 a portion of the territory was set off and annexed to West Gardiner. There are in town church edifices of the Congregationalist, Baptists, and Free Baptists, two each of the two last. Litchfield has fifteen public schoolhouses, valued at $5,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $496,908. In 1880 it was $454,330. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 15 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,506. According to the census of 1880 it had fallen off to 1,310. LittletOllj in Aroostook County, joins Houlton on the north of that town. It is bounded on other sides by Monticello on the north, letter B. Township on the west, and Wilmot, in New Bruns wick, on the east. The area is 22,040 acres. The northern half was granted to Framingham Academy by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1801, and was surveyed in the following year. The southern half is the northern part of a township granted to Williams College in 1800, the southern half of which now forms the northern half of Houlton. It was located in 1801 by Park Holland. Though settlements began so earlyr, it did not until 1856 contain a sufficient number of inhabit ants to obtain the act of incorporation, which it then first received. The most of the lots are now occupied. Littleton post-office is near the centre of the town. The stage-line from Houlton to Upper Aroos took passes this point. The surface of the town is diversified by swells and forest tracts. 22"], [346, "338 GAZEETER OF MAINE. The land is fertile, and yields well of the crops suitable to the latitude. The Meduxnekeag River crosses the north-east part of the town, furnish ing several good water-powers. Big Brook, which comes from the north west through the town to the Meduxnekeag, also has some good powers. The Methodists and Free Baptists both have organizations in the town. The number of public schoolhouses is seven, having, with ap purtenances, the value of $800. The value of estates in 1870 was $94,257. In 1880 it was $126,289. The population in 1870 was 700. In 1880 it was 904. Livermore, the north-western town of Androscoggin County, was incorporated in 1795. It was originally a grant from Massachusetts to certain persons for services in the expedition against Port Royal about the middle of the century, whence its early name of Port Royal. The Androscoggin River, the division between it and East Livermore and Leeds on the east and south-east, on the south is Tur ner, on the west Hartford and Canton, and on the north Canton and Jay. It contains about 17,800 acres of land. Long and Round ponds, in the northern part of the town, and separated by a few rods only, are the largest. Bartlett's Pond is near the centre, and Brettun's is in the south-westerly part of the town. Livermore constitutes the high middle ground between the hills of Oxford and the more moderate elevations of the Kennebec. Its highest hills are Hamlin's (or Mount Seir), But ler's and Birch. These afford extended views toward the White Mountains, the Penobscot River and the sea. The soil, though stony, is strong and productive. Apples and dairy products form the largest items for the market. There are mills for lumber, and turned wooden boxes, and a cheese-factory at Brettun's Mills (Livermore Village P. O.) ; a tannery, cheese-factory, two mills, and a grist-mill at North Livermore ; and a saw-mill near Livermore Falls. Deacon Elijah Livermore and Major Thomas Fish were the first settlers, removing to the place in 1779. Major Fish perished in a snow storm in the following winter while on the way home from Winthrop, where he had been to visit the lady to whom he was engaged. Deacon Livermore built the first mill in town in 1782 or 1783 near Long Pond. Saw, fulling, card and grist mills have since been operated on the out let of this pond. Early in the century Deacon Livermore built a grist and saw mill at the outlet of Brettun's Pond. The first church was of the Baptist denomination, and was organized in 1793. The Methodists organized a society in 1802, under the direction of Rev. Joshua Soule, afterward a bishop of that church. The town has now Universalist, Methodist, and Baptist and Free Baptist churches. There are seven teen schoohouses in the town, worth about $4,000. The estates in 1870 were valued at $524,267. In 1880 they were $430,709. The popu lation at that date was 1,467. In 1880 it was 1,262. Among the noted citizens were General David Learned, Jonathan G. Hunton, subse quently governor of Maine ; Reuel Washburn, judge of Probate for An droscoggin ; Dr. Cyrus Hamlin, Israel Washburn, and others. Natives of the town who have obtained eminence are Israel Washburn, Jr., LL.D., member of Congress and governor of Maine ; ElihuB., member of Con gress for Illinois, secretary of state in 1869, and later United States min ister to France ; Cadwallader C, member of Congress from Wisconsin."], [347, "LIVERMOBE FALLS, LIVEUMORE, ME."], [348, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 340 major-general of volunteers, and subsequently governor of Wisconsin \u25a0 Charles A., United States minister in Paraguay, and author of a his tory of that country ; Samuel B., once a shipmaster, later captain of a marine force in the war of the Rebellion ; William D., an extensive manufacturer and surveyor-general of Minnesota, all brothers ; Han nibal Hamlin, LL.D., representative and senator in Congress, and others. Livermore has had two centenarians, \u2014 Captain David Hink ley. who died in 1867, aged one hundred and two years, lacking a few days ; and Sarah Kidder, who was born in 1771, and was living at last accounts, when she was above one hundred and one years. The town had 98 men in service during the war of the Rebellion, among whom was Colonel Lee Strickland. Locke's Mills, a small village and post-office in Green wood, Oxford County. LOllg\" Island Plantation, in Hancock County, is situated 40 miles south of Ellsworth, and 15 south of Tremont, on Mount Desert Island, with which it is connected by boat. It consists of Long, Harbor, Crow, John's, Two Sisters, two Green, two Duck, East Black, Plasentia, West Black, Calf, Pond, Sheep, and Ram islands. The occupation of the inhabitants is fishing and farming. The principal crops are hay and potatoes. The plantation has one Baptist church. There is one public school house, and this, with other school property, is valued at $700. The valuation of estates in 1880 was $22,291. The rate of taxation was 8 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 177. In 1880 it was 150. LOllg\" Poild, a post-office in Hancock County. LOVell is situated in the southern part of Oxford County, but north of Fryeburg, and having Stowe between it and the New Hamp shire line. On the north-west and north-east it is bounded by Stone ham, east by Waterford, and south-east by Sweden. The area is 24,000 acres. Upper Kezar Pond nearly divides the town into eastern and western parts, being 8 miles long by about 1 broad. The surface of the town is uneven, especially on the eastern side of the Pond, where it is mountainous. Some names of the eminences are Amos Mountain, Mount Reho, McDaniel's Hill, Sebatos Mountain, and Chris tian and Sheriff hills. Kezar River, the outlet of ponds of that name in Waterford, runs southward through the eastern part of the town to the Saco.* At Lovell Village, on this stream, near the southern part of the town, are several mills. There are also mills near the centre on the outlet of a small pond ; and at North Lovell there is a steam-mill, manufacturing spools and long lumber. Other manufactures of the town are shooks, axe-handles and ox-goads, carriages and sleighs, cab net work and coffins, boots and shoes, harnesses^ etc. The small centres in Lovell, other than the principal ones already mentioned, are \" Slab City,\" \" Sucker Brook \" (the outlet of Horse-shoe Pond), an 1 * The name Kezar occurring so frequently in this region, is the name of an old hunter who dwelt here."], [349, "LOWELL. 341 \" Cushman's Mills,\" on the outlet of Andrew's Pond. The soil in this town is very good, yielding well of all the usual crops. The forests are well diffused, containing many trees of large size. There is much beautiful scenery in the town. The first settlements here were made in 1777, and bore the name of New Suncook until their incorporation in November 15, 1800. The present name was adopted in honor of John Lovell (Lovewell) the hero of the decisive fight in 1725 against the Pequaket tribe of Indiana who occupied this region. The township was granted to the officers and soldiers engaged in that battle and their heirs. Sweden was set off from Lovell in 1813. The names of several of the first settlers are Noah Eastman, Stephen Dresser, John Steams, Captain John Wood, Oliver Whitney, Joseph and Annias McAllaster, Benjamin Steams, Josiah Heald, Levi Dresser, John Whiting, Abel Butters and James Kilgrave. Lovell has two Congregationalist churches, and one each of the Methodists, Universalists, and Christians. The number of public school houses is twelve ; and the school property is valued at $3,200. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $305,764. In 1880 it was $305,632. The population in 1870 was 1,018. In 1880 it was 1,077. LOWell is an agricultural town of Penobscot County, lying oast of the Penobscot River, 48 miles N.N.E. of Bangor. It is bounded on the north by Enfield and Lincoln, east by Burlington, south by township No. 1, of the Bingham Purchase, and west by Passadumkeag. Some portions of Coldstream Pond, at the north-west corner, lie within the town ; and on the eastern line lies Eskulassis Pond, whose outlet, flowing southward to the Passadumkeag, in the southern part of the town, furnishes five water-powers. The latter stream also has four falls and descents. The principal powers in town bear the names \"Passa dumkeag Rips,\" \" Little Falls,\" \" High Ledge,\" \" Lighting Rips,\" \" Varney's Mills,\" \"Porter's grist and saw mill \"and \"Woodman's Mill.\" There is also a tannery. The surface of the town is uneven and in parts broken. There are several considerable hills in the northern part. The uplands, though stony, are fertile and excellent for grazing. Along the streams are large tracts of meadow-land, which yield lieavy crops of hay. The principal business centre is in the vicinity of Lowell post-office, in in the south-west part of the tovrn. The European and North-Ameri can Railway station at Passadumkeag, about 8 miles west of Lowell post-office, affords the nearest railroad connection. Alpheus Hayden and Levi Done were the first settlers, having begun their residence here in March, 1819. The lands of these and other early settlers were purchased of the State. Mary C. Dean (subsequently the wife of Stephen Kimball, Esq., of Bangor) was the first school teacher, and Rev. Pindar Field, the first minister of the plantation. They were so highly esteemed that the name of the plantation, which had previously been called \"Page's Mills,\" was changed to Deanfield, thus joining the memory of both in a word. The settlement was incorporated February, 1837, under the name of Huntersville. This was changed the next year to Lowell, in honor of the first person born in town, Lowell Hayden, son of Alpheus, one of the two first settlers. In 1841 a tract called the \" Strip,\" lying north of township No. 1,"], [350, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 342 Bingham's Penobscot purchase, was annexed to Lowell. The settlers of this tract purchased their lands of the Bingham heirs. In 1842 the Coldstream settlement was annexed. There are considerable numbers of Congregationalist, Baptist and Free Baptist people in the town, who meet with their brethren in churches in adjoining towns. The number of public schoolhouses in in Lowell is eight; and the school .property of the town is valued at $1,350. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $72,126. In 1880 it was $65,406. rl ie population in 1870 was 448. In 1880 it was 433. LlllbeC embraces the most south-easterly part of Washington County, of the State of Maine and of the United States ; and Quoddy Head is the south-easterly point of all these. This point is marked by a lighthouse, with a brick tower painted in red and white stripes, the lamp having a flashing, white light. This town is bounded on the north by Perry and Pembroke, from both of which it is separated by Lubec Bay and its passages ; on the west by Trescott, and on the south and east by the ocean. Campo Bello Island lies on the east of Lubec, separated only by a narrow passage of the sea, and Grand Menan, on the south- east at a minimum distance of about 5 miles. Both of these belong to Great Britain. Lubec has a large and admirable harbor, of sufficient depth for the largest vessels, and is never obstructed by ice, is easy of access, and well protected from rough seas by points and islands. The principal place of business is at the end of a point of land jutting :-into and dividing the harbor, \u2014 the situation being very beautiful. The -whole eastern shore north of Quoddy Head is thickly settled ; and so -also is that part of the interior of the town lying along an arm of the -sea, at whose western point is West Lubec. There is at this point a good tide-power, which is improved by a \u25a0saw-mill. The largest power in the town is at Lubec Mills, where is a tide-power of about 15 feet fall, and a pond of over 100 acres, equal to about 100 horse-power. This was formerly occupied by plaster-mills. .Lubec has two ship-yards, three boat-builders, three sail-makers, and the other small manufactures common to villages. The Lubec lead mines \u2022are situated near the northern part of the town. The principal business of the inhabitants, is agriculture and fisheries. The town is on the stage-line from East Machias, 23 miles distant, and steamboat- line from Eastport, 3 miles distant. The first settlers of Lubec were French people, who came from Nova Scotia in 1758, but after remaining a short time removed to the upper parts of the St. John River, or to Lower Canada. The per- manent settlement of the place was commenced in 1776 by Col. John Allan and several others, patriot fugitives from Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. It may well be supposed that some Germans also had settled here, since when the town was incorporated it was named for the good old German city, Lubeck. Louis F. Delesdernier and Nehe- miah Small were the first settlers and also the first traders on \"Flagg's Point,\" where Lubec Village now stands; they having come hither from Eastport in 1814, when the British occupied that place. There was a Congregational church organized here in 1820, under the labors of Rev. Elijah Kellogg. Rev. Andrew Bigelow was, in 1821, ordained as the first pastor. The churches in the town now consist of one each of the Methodists, Baptists aud the Disciples, and two of the"], [351, "LYMAN. 343 Christians. The number of public schoolhouses is ten. The school property of the town is valued at $5,100. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $309,406. In 1880 it was $310,818. The population in 1870 was 2,136. In 1880 it was 2,109. LlldlOW, in Aroostook County, is a half township adjoining the northern part of Houlton on the west. New Limerick bounds it on the south, and Smyrna on the west. Moose River and Mill Brook are the principal streams. The surface is somewhat varied by swells, but is without high hills. Birch, beech, maple, spruce and hemlock constitute the forests. The rock is chiefly slate. The soil is slaty in some parts and a gravely loam in others. Hayr, oats, wheat and pota toes are the chief crops, and yield well. The plantation has two saw mills, each capable of sawing 5m. feet per day. The buildings are generally in good repair, giving due evidence of thrift. The nearest railroad station is at Houlton, 5 miles distant. White's mineral epring in this town has some local reputation. Ludlow has four public schoolhouses, and its school property alto gether is valued at $700. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $57,888. In 1880 it was $109,657. The population in 1870 was 371. In 1880 it was 468. Lyman, in York County, joins Alfred at the west corner, while an angle nearly opposite touches the western corner of Bidde- ford. The form of the town is nearly that of a regular rhomboid, its greatest diameter being from north to south. Dayton bounds it on the north-west, Kennebunkport on the south-east, Sanford on the south- west, and Waterborough on the north-west. The number of acres of land contained is 14,244 acres. The surface is moderately uneven. Grant Hill, near Kennebunk and Swan ponds, is probably the highest elevation of land in town. The soil is fair, producing good crops of grain and grass, and of apples. The chief bodies of water consist of the two ponds named, near the centre of the town, Barker Pond, at the east, Bunganut Pond, at the north-west, and Tarwater Pond midway of the northwestern line of the town. There are seven considerable streams in town, of which the largest is Kennebunk River, which is formed by the outlet of Kennebunk Pond. The principal business centre is Good- win's Mills, a neat little cluster of buildings in the south-eastern part of the town, which has borne its present name since 1782. There are hers saw and grist mills. The line of Dayton passes through the vib lage, dividing it between the two towns. A conspicuous monument near the Baptist Church honors the memory of one of the earliest merchants and valued citizens of the place, \u2014 Benjamin Dudley. On the outlet of Swan Pond are two powers, each utilized for a saw-mill, and there is also a saw-mill on the eastern outlet of Kenne bunk Pond, lumbering being still a source of considerable income to the inhabitants. The nearest railroad station is at Biddeford, with which there is daily stage connection. John Sanders, John Bush and Peter Turbat, in 1660 purchased of the Indian sagamore Fluellen, a tract of land embracing nearly the present limits of the town ; and the titles are from this source and from Massachusetts. The proprietors sold their titie, in 1668, to Har-"], [352, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 344 lackindine Symonds, who conveyed his right to Roger Haskins and thirty-five others, and under the proprietorship of these the town was settled in 1767. John Low was a leading man in town affairs for many years, representing them in General Court. Ichabod Dam was another of the trusted early citizens, and several years a member of the General Court from his town. Nathaniel Low was secretary of the Maine Senate in 1826. Robert Swansen, remembered by the older in habitants as Master Swansen, was a surveyor, and a prominent man in the town affairs. William Waterhouse, a school-teacher, with his family removed to this town between 1764 and 1775. Pierce Murphy, who served in the Revolution, settled in the town after its close. John Burbank was another Revolutionary soldier, and was captured in the privateer \"Dalton \" and carried to England in 1777. In 1779 he was master-at-arms on board the \" Bonne Homme Richard,\" and was in the action with the \" Serapis \" and \" Countess of Scarborough,\" in Septem ber of that year, under John Paul Jones. He spent his last years in Lyman with his son-in-law, Joseph Taylor. Jacob Rhoades, Richard Thomson, Joseph Roberts, the Hills, Smiths, Warrens, Emmons, Lit tlefields, and Cuffs were likewise respected citizens of the early times. The town was first incorporated in 1778 under the name of Coxhall, which it retained until 1803, when it was changed to Lyman, in honor of Theodore Lyman, of Boston, formerly of York. The first house of worship was built in 1788, about one and a quar ter miles north-west of Goodwin's Mills. In 1798 the Baptists in town were exempted from paying a tax to support the ministry on condition of settling one of their own. The Congregationalists, Bap tists, Free Baptists and Methodists now have each a church in town. Lyman has ten public schoolhouses, valued at $3,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $345,346. In 1880 it was $273,739. The popu lation at the same date was 1,052. In 1880 it was 1,004. LyildOll, a post-office in Caribou, Aroostook County. IVXadliaS, the shiretown of Washington County, is situated midway of the south shore of the county, on the Machias River, near its mouth. The western portion extends southward to Little Kenne bec Bay. Machiasport bounds it on the south-east, also on the east with East Machias and Marshfield. The latter also bounds it on the north, and Whitneyville and Jonesboro on the west. The surface X the town is uneven, but fertile. The rocks along the river are traps, but there is an extensive granite quarry within three miles of the falls. The water-power of this town consists of a series of falls on the Ma chias River, at the head of navigation, six miles above the river's mouth, and three above its junction with the East Machias River. The gross power of the falls is that of about 937 horses. Vessels of 600 tons receive cargoes within 300 feet of the mills. Freshets do no harm, hence mill machinery is secure. Within this town are eight saw-mills manufacturing long and short lumber, a sash, blind and door factory, one or more ship-yards, an iron-foundry and machine-shop, two grain mills, a carding-mill, canned-food factories, carriage-factories, sail-loft, two printing establishments, a tow-boat company, silver mining com pany, etc. The Machias Savings Bank held, at the beginning of the fiscal year of 1880, in deposits and profits, the sum of $339,708.36."], [353, "MACHIAS. 345 The town has a connection with Portland by a steamboat-line, and with Bangor and Calais by a line of stages. A railroad for freight connect ing Machiasport and Whitneyville passes through the town. Machias was incorporated June 23, 1784 ; then embracing territory now constituting the towns of East Machias, Whitneyville, Machias port and Marshfield. It was the first town incorporated between the Penobscot and the St. Croix. East Machias was set off Jan. 24, 1826; Whitneyville, Feb. 10, 1845 ; Machiasport, Jan. 24, 1826; and Marsh field, June 30, 1846. The English first became acquainted with the place in 1633, when Richard Vines established a trading-post there. A fierce contest was at this time going on between France and England, and in the following spring, La Tour, the French commander in the region, made a descent upon it from his seat at Port Royal, killing two of its six defenders, and carrying the others away with their merchan dise. No persistent attempt was again made to hold this point by the English or French xor upwards of 120 years. In 1704, Major Church found and captured here John Bretoon, of Jersey, with his wife and child, and M. Lattre, with his wife and three children. In 1734 the place was visited by the Governor of Massachusetts. In 1762, on ac count of the scarcity of hay arising from the drought, Isaiah Foster, Isaac Larabee, and others from Scarborough, visited the place in search of grass, finding a great quantity of it in the marshes. Quite a num ber of persons settled here the following year, and having thus become acquainted with the -\".vantages of the place, 80 persons of whom no less than 54 were from Scarborough, petitioned the General Court for a grant of this vicinity for settlement, which was allowed in 1770. Among those who became residents in 1763 were S. and S. Scott, T. D. and G. Libby, S. and J. Stone, W. B. and J. Larabee, D. and J. Hill, D. Fogg, and J. Foster, most of whom located at the West Fall, and Messrs. Munson, Foster, Levey and Scott, settled at East Falls. Morris O'Brien and his sons, in 1765, built a double saw-mill at the former place. Hon. Stephen Jones settled here in 1768. His son was for many years a judge of the Common Pleas and judge of Probate in Washington County. In 1770, many others having come in, several mills were erected on East and West Rivers, and one on Middle River. It fell to the lot of the Machias people to initiate the Revolution ary struggle on the sea, as the people of Lexington and Concord had done upon the land. Capt. Ichabod Jones, of Boston, obtained leave to send a small vessel with provisions to Machias on condition of re turning with a cargo of wood and lumber. Accordingly his sloop, convoyed by the armed English schooner Margaret, commanded by Lieutenant Moore, arrived here on the 9th of May, bringing the first intelligence of the bloody conflicts at Lexington and Concord. It was not many days before the inhabitants made known their sentiments by the erection of a liberty pole at a prominent point in the settlement. Lieutenant Moore, learning the significance of the pole, ordered it to be removed, under a threat of firing on the town. By the influence of Mr. Jones, the British commander was induced to delay the execution of his threat from day to day, while several meetings were held by the inhabitants to consider the matter ; but they every time voted not to take down the pole. The final meeting was to be held on Monday, and on the previous Sunday, a plot was laid to capture Lieutenantt"], [354, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 346 Moore at the meeting-house as the service closed : but seeing through the window some armed men crossing the river above, he took the alarm, sprang through the open window, and escaped to his vessel. An armed company of the settlers followed down to the shore, when the Margaretta, after firing a few shots over the settlement, slipped down the river. Early the next morning, Benjamin Foster, Jeremiah O'Brien and his five stalwart brothers, and some others, gathered at the wharf, and took possession of Jones' wood sloop ; then by shouts they gathered the men of the settlement on board. A plan of captur ing the Margaretta was made known, the timid were allowed to go ashore, while the bolder spirits, a few only armed with muskets, others with pitchforks and axes, sailed down the river to attack the British schooner. Another company, in a small coaster, followed them. They found the schooner in the bay, and run alongside with the intention of boarding. She received them with a discharge of several guns, muskets and hand grenades, by which several were killed. The vessels fell apart, only John O'Brien, one of the six brothers, having got on board the enemy. Several of the British instantly fired at him, but not a bullet touched him. Then they charged upon him with their bayonets; but before they could reach him he was overboard, and swimming towards the sloop, which he reached without other harm than a wet ting. The only cannon possessed by the patriots was a wall piece, which they balanced on the rail, and fired with destructive effect. The muskets, also, did good service, and the decks of the Margaretta were cleared. Several of the enemy had fallen, including the comman der, and when the vessels were brought together again, the officer in command fled below in terror, and the crew yielded at once. On the 26th of June following, the Massachusetts Congress passed a formal vote of thanks to the heroes of this affair. The Margaretta was the first British vessel captured by the Americans ; and the action merits the name it has received of \" The Lexington of the Seas.\" Foster and Jeremiah O'Brien were soon after commissioned for priva teering, and were very successful. Machias soon became aggressive, and an expedition was filled out to aid the patriots in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Thinking it necessary to crush this rebellious town, the governor of Nova Scotia, in 1777, sent Sir George Collier with four vessels and eighty marines to accomplish this purpose. They arrived in the bay early in August, and after burning a tide-mill, two dwellings, two barns and a guard house, and committing other depredations below, one of the brigs was towed by barges to the mouth of Middle River, within half a mile of Machias Falls. Here such a lively fire was poured down upon them from the high banks that the crews of the barges were driven on board the brig, whence again all was driven below deck, and the brig drifted helplessly down the stream. Every man in the place able to bear arms was now upon the shore, Major Stillman being in charge ; while on the other side of the river were forty or fifty Passa maquoddy Indians sent by Colonel John Allan, and led by Joseph Neeala, their chief. The Indians raised their peculiar yell, which the white people imitated, until the woods rang with them ; and the British were glad to reach the bay again. A notable incident in this contest was the journey of Hannah Weston, with another young woman from the Pleasant River settlement, 20 miles west, to bring powder for the patriots. A clay or two later the squadron sailed away."], [355, "MACHIAS. 347 Among the first who built mills in the place were Ichabod Jones and Jonathan Longfellow. The first meeting-houses was built in 1774 on a lot given by George Libby, on the site of which Libby Hall now stands. The building was 42 feet long, 25 feet wide, and one story in height. In 1786, by vote of the town, \u00a3200 were raised to build two meeting-houses. The first newspaper of Machias was called \"The Eastern State.\" It was published by Jeremiah Balch, and bore the date of Dee. 23, 1823. There are now two weekly papers, the \"Machias Republican,\" an excellant republican sheet, published every Saturday, by C. O. Furbush, and the \" Machias Union,\" of which Messrs. Drisko & Parlin are the enterprising publishers. Its day of publication is Tuesday, and its politics are firmly democratic. Among the fine build ings of Machias are she court-house and jail, constructed of brick and granite ; the former in 1855, at a cost of $25,000, and the latter in 1857, at a cost of $35,000. The United States building containing the post office and custom-house is also of brick and granite. It was built in 1871, at a cost of $30,000. Centre Street Church and Libby Hall are fine wooden buildings. There are also many tasteful and some quite handsome private residences. The streets are adorned with shade trees, and the town bears many marks of age and culture. George S. Hillard, who died in Boston in 1879, was a native of Machias. He was a leading member of the Suffolk bar, held various honorable public offices, and was the author of several popular works in the departments of geography-, history, and travels, and of a series of school readers known as Hillard's Readers. A notable resident of Machias during and subsequent to the Revolution was Col. John Allan, born in 1746, in Edinburgh Castle, Scotland. His father, a man of letters and wealth, removed to Halifax, N. S., in 1750. Though a member of the Nova Scotia Assembly, Colonel Allan's sympathies were with the American people, and in 177C, when thirty years of age, he was forced to leave his home and seek refuge in a more patriotic community. In the following year, by direction of Congress, an order of General Washington made him superintendent of the Eastern Indians and commander of the troops at Machias. Love of liberty seems to have been a ruling passion with him. The Indian tribes respected him as si father. His descendants are distinguished for industry, frugality and integrity. His burial place is on the island formerly owned by him near Eastport, now known as Treat's Island. The first organized church in Machias and in Washington County was Congregationalist, and dates from September, 1782. Rev. James Lyon, the first pastor, was a graduate of Princeton College, and came to Machias in 1771 ; continuing in this service in the east and west villages until his death in 1795. He was a man of more than ordinary ability, of deep piety, and an earnest patriot. This society still con tinues, and is said to be one of the largest in the State. The other societies are Baptist, Methodist, Universalist and Catholic. There is a public library in the village containing about 2,000 volumes. Ail have good church-edifices. The village has an excellent high-school, with a graded system. There are nine public schoolhouses, some of which are superior structures. The value of the school property is estimated at $18,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $978,135. In 1880 it was $779,588. The population in 1870 was $2,525. In 1880 it was 2,203."], [356, "348 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Machiasport occupies a peninsula on each side of Machias Bay, at its head, and about midway of the southern line of Washing ton County. This town joins Machias and East Machias on the nortn, and Whiting on the north-east. Machias Bay bounds it on the east, and Little Kennebec Bay separates it from Machias on the west. The mouth of Machias River divides the town into two portions. The principal village and business is at the northern part of the town, though several coves along the eastern shore have small villages. A railroad for lumber and other freight connects this port with Whitney ville, 8 miles to the north-west. Machiasport has an excellent harbor, open all the year. There is here some ship-building and boat-building, together with the block spar and sail making which are necessary adjuncts to shipyards. A marine railroad further supplies the needs of a seaport. Coasting and the fisheries constitute a large part of the occupation of the inhabitants. A toll-bridge 600 feet in length con nects the town with East Machias. The soil of this town is largely clay and gravel, but it yields good returns in hay and potatoes, which are the principal crops. Some considerable hills bear the names of Howard, Hampden, Fletcher and Bald Mountain. Spruce, fir and birch are the most numerous forest trees ; but the village streets are shaded by a variety of native and foreign origin. In all parts of the town are good roads, and pleasant residences. The town-hall is considered to be one of the best in the county. On the seashore, between high and low water marks, is an inclined table ot rock bearing inscriptions to the number of about 150, supposed to be of Indian origin. The figures are cut in the rock, and resemble chiefly figures of Indians and moose; but there are also plans of streams, figures of a cow, panther, fox, serpent, Indian medicine man, and Romish priest. The age of these inscriptions is not known, as they were as much a mystery to the early inhabitants as to those of the present day. Machiasport furnished 35 men to aid in the preser vation of the Union during the late war, losing 14. The Congregationalists, Baptists and Advents have churches here. The town has a system of graded schools and owns eight schoolhouses, valued at $6,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $197,221. In 1880 it was $191,248.

Caribou bounds it on the north, Presque Isle on the south, and Mapleton and Washburn on the west. The surface of the town is somewhat rolling, but without high elevations, May Hill being the highest. The Aroostook comes in at the west and leaves on the northern border making a complete oxbow about the centre of the town. At its exit it receives Hardwood Creek, which comes in at the west along the northern line ; and at the south-west Presque Isle River joins it from southward. In the western part of the town, the Aroos took flows around many islands. Maysville has one or two small saw mills and a starch-factory. The factory is of 727 tons oapiacity, and consumes 140,000 bushels of potatoes in a single season. The underlying rock in this town is limestone, found everywhere, either outcropping or under the surface, but seldom more than 20 feet below. The soil, as might be supposed, is quite calcareous. Potatoes are the leading money crop. Hay, wheat and oats are also largely raised, and, like the first, yield well. The forests contains a great variety of trees. The town is 42 miles N.N.W. of Houlton, on the stage-route to Caribou. The latter is 7 miles distant, and furnishes the nearest rail road station. Presque Isle Village, lying near the south line of Mays ville, is the centre of business for the latter town. Maysville was incorporated, April 4, 1859. The town-hall is a large, two-story wooden building nearly new, with a school-room below. In the spring of 1880, near 500 trees, mostly of rock maples, were set out along the highways"], [367, "MEDFORD. 359 by members of Maysville Grange. The people take pride in the ex cellent roads of the town. A bridge across the Aroostook here is 420 feet in length. The town has 12 schoolhouses, all in good condition. The value of school property is $3,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $140,057. In 1880 it was $224,288. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 16 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 758. In 1880 it was 1,141. Mechanic FallS is a manufacturing village and post office in Androscoggin County, lying on the Little Androscoggin River in the adjacent towns of Minot and Poland. MeddybempS lies in the eastern part of Washington County, 10 miles south-west of Calais, and 35 miles N.N.E. of Machias. It is bounded by Alexander and Baring on the north, on the east by the latter, south by Charlotte and Cooper, and west by the latter. About one third of Meddybemps Lake lies in the town, extending to the centre. The area of this sheet of water is 15 square miles. It has its outlet at this point, constituting Denny's River. On this stream and about the southern extremity of the lake Meddybemps Village is situated. The Fall on the outlet here is 20 feet in one eighth of a mile. The mills upon it consist of one shingle-machine, one lath and stave mill, and one grist-mill. About thirty years since a good beginning was made in ornamenting the village by setting out a few elms. The surface of the town is variable in elevation, but the highest hills do not exceed 200 feet. The underlying rock is granitic in character. The soil is a gravelly loam. Hay and potatoes are the crops chiefly cultivated. Spruce, pine, birch and maple are still abun dant in the forests. The town sent 40 men to the defence of the Union in the late war, losing 7. Meddybemps was incorporated, February, 20, 1841. It was formed from portions of Cooper, Charlotte and Baring. The Baptists have a church-edifice here ; and the Methodists have a society, and sustain meetings. There are two public schoolhouses in the town. The entire school property is valued at $1,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $24,080. 'in 1880 it was $25,833. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 26 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 200. In 1880 it was 172. J\\ledlOrd is one of the two extreme south-eastern towns of PiseaV.aquis County. It has an incorporated township on the north, Milo on the west, Maxfield on the east, and La Grange on the south, both the latter being in Penobscot County. The Piscataquis River passes through the midst of the town. Where the Schoodic stream falls into the Piscataquis, General Boyd, in 1820, erected the largest saw-mill then upon the Penobscot or any of its branches. In 1832 it was taken down, and another was built, and taken down ; but still another was erected on this side. In 1835 a saw and a grist-mill were built on Cold Brook, which flows into the Piscataquis from the south; and around these the village of Medford has sprung up. The settlement of the township preceded any grant. James Grovei"], [368, "360 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. with his family, as early as 1808, dwelt on the south bank of the Pis cataquis near the upper ferry ; a Mr. Boobar followed ; and later came a Mr. Weston and two Hitchborns from Bangor. About 1820, the state opened the Bennock road from Piscataquis River to Oldtown. This township was No. 2, Range 7, and contains 20,625 acres. In 1816 the western half was granted to David Gilmore for making the Dixmont road ; the eastern half was the same year sold to General J. P. Boyd. The township was incorporated in 1824, and, at the instance of General Boyd, received the name of Kilmarnock. In 1856, on the petition of the inhabitants, it was renamed as at present. Medford is on the stage-line from Milo depot to Enfield. Stores were open in the township at an early date of its settlement, but only one or two is at present sustained. Al1 the lands reserved for public uses in the town are for the benefit of the schools. Medford has six schoolhouses valued at $1,250. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $60,321. In 1880 it was $52,885. The population in 1870 was 398. In 1880 it was 294. IViedway, in Penobscot County, is situated on the Penobscot River at the junction of the East Branch, 70 miles north of Bangor. Moodville lies on the south, an angle of Mattawankeag touches at the south-east, and Molunkus in Aroostook County lies in the east. The Penobscot crosses the town in a south-easterly course, receiving on the way East Branch, its principal tributary, and Salmon Stream, both from the north ; and Pattakumkis Stream from the south-west. Both the last enter the river near the south-east corner of the town. On the Pattakumkis is a saw-mill manufacturing shingles. Medway village is situated at the junction of the East Branch with the Penob scot, a mile or two south-west of the centre of the town. At this place is an extensive tannery. The surface of the town is rolling and somewhat broken. Gravel Hill some 300 feet in height is the greatest elevation. The prev alent rock is granite. The soil is chiefly clay, but yields fairly of hay grain and potatoes, which are the crops chiefly cultivated. The nearest railroad station is that of the European and North American Railway at Mattawamkeag, 12 miles distant. Medway was organized as a plantation in 1852, and as a town Feb., 8, 1875. Formerly it bore the name of Nicatou. This town sent 20 men to the aid of the Union cause during the war of the Rebellion. The Congregationalists have an organized society here. The number of public schoolhouses is six. The entire school property of the town is valued at $3,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $30,637. In 1880 it was $ 79,638. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2\u00a3 per cent. The population in 1870 was 321. In 1880 it was 628. MeglUntiCOOk Mountain,\u2014 see article on Camdem. MerCd* is the south-western town of Somerset County, and lies 12 miles west of Skowhegan. Starks bounds it on the north, Nor ridgewock and Smithfield on the east, Rome, in Kennebec County, on the south, and New Sharon, in Franklin County, on the west. The Sandy River forms the dividing line on the north-west part of the"], [369, "MERRILL PLANTATION. 361 town for a considerable distance. Bog Pond lies between the middle and the western line of the town, and parallel to the last, for two-thirds the length north and south. Its outlet empties into the Sandy River at the northern line. North Pond at the south-east corner occupies portions of the three towns which join here. It is 3 miles long by- 2 wide. The surface of the town is gently undulating, with one large swell, called Beech Hill, nearly in the middle, which contains above 20 superior farms. The landscapes visible from this hill are very beauti ful. Probably the highest eminence in town is not above 300 feet in height. Granite is the principal rock visible. The soil is a clay loam. There is a great deal of fine interval. The chief crops are hay and corn. Most of the woods flourish here with a predominance of the hard woods. The water-power is chiefly on Bog Stream at Mercer Village. There are here a saw-mill for long and short lumber, a tan nery, a grist-mill, and other manufactures common to villages. The streets are beautified with elm and maple trees, some of them seventy-five years old. The houses are neat and attractive with some quite handsome residences. The buildings throughout the town are in good repair, the roads are excellent, and barns, fields, flocks and herds give tokens of thrift and abundance. The town is regarded as salubrious, since there are many old people. The settlement of Mercer was commenced very soon after the close of the Revolutionary war. If we trust tradition, Nathaniel Emery, a Revolutionary soldier, was the first settler, and emphatically the pioneer of the town. His practice was to fell a few acres of trees, build a log house, sell his improvements to some new comer, then com mence again. Others among the first settlers were Nahum Baldwin, from New Hampshire, Samuel Hinkley, from Georgetown, Maine., Nathaniel Davis, from Cape Ann, another soldier, Ambrose Arnold, and Joshua Greenleaf, who settled here in 1785, dying in 1856, aged ninety-three years. The first settlements were on the river lots, where the intervals, prior to settlement, were covered with noble growths of maple, elm, butternut, and other hard woods, showing conclusively the strength of the soil. Little more than the river lots were occupied until 1801, when settlers began to come in rapidly, so that in a few years there was not an unoccupied lot. The titles were mostly from the Plymouth Company. The town was incorporated in 1804. Twenty families with their farms were annexed from Starks in 1835. In 1840 a portion of Mercer containing twenty-five families was set off to form a part of Stnithfield ; and in 1841 another portion, containing twelve families was given to New Sharon. Mercer sent 78 men to do battle for the Union in the war of the Rebellion. Twenty-five of this number were lost. The church-edi fices here are two Union and one Free Baptist. There are eleven pub lic schoolhouses, and the entire school property is valued at $2,450. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $300,670. In 1880 it was $215, 294. The population in 1870 was 846. In 1880 it was 755. Merrill Plantation occupies township No. 6, Range 4, in Aroostook County. It is 20 miles west of Houlton on the road to Moro Plantation. The chief streams are Lower Hastings and Dudley brooks. The east branch of the Mattawamkeag, near the eastern line,"], [370, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 362 impinges upon it near the south-east corner. The centre of business of the plantation is at this point. The post-office is at Smyrna Mills, near by. The settlements are about here, and along the Smyrna and Rocka bema road, which runs north-west and south-east through the midst of the town, with a few in the south-western part. Four lots are reserved for public uses. This plantation was organized in 1876. It has two public school houses, and the school property is estimated at $400. The valuation of estates in 1880 was $15,605. The population in 1870 was 118. In 1880 it was 206. Merry-meetillg Bay, see articles on Sagadahoc County, Bowdoinham, Topsham, Brunswick and Bath. MexiCO, in the eastern part of Oxford County, is bounded on the east by Dixfield, south by Peru, west by Rumford, and north by Roxbury and Carthage, in Franklin County. The town is somewhat of the diamond form, its largest axis being about 8^ miles by 5 miles for the shorter axis. The surface is agreeably varied with meadow and up land, with four considerable elevations. These are set around the middle of the town, and bear the names of Thompson, Porter and Maun hills. The Androscoggin River forms the line on the south boundary, Webb's River on the east, and Swift River, coming down from the north, crosses and recrosses the western line. The rock is mainly granite. The forests still show a noble growth of birch, beech, maple, pine, spruce and hemlock. Along the rivers the soil is a sandy loam, with red loam on the uplands. Corn, potatoes, wheat, hops, and other crops are cultivated successfully, the last being probably the largest crop sold directly. Swift River has a fall of 50 feet in half a mile in this town. The manufactures are. at the southern angle of the town. There are here a 6team-mill (comprises a shingle, lath, board and grist mill), a tooth pick, a cheese, and a carriage factory. Mexico lies about 30 miles north of Paris. It is on the stage-line from Bryant's Pond on Grand Trunk Railroad to Dixfield and Byron. The nearest railroad station is that of the Buckfield and Rumford Falls Railroad at Canton, about 10 miles distant. The post-offices are Mexico and Dixfield, the first in the western part of the town, the second just across the river at the south. Hon. Charles W. Walton, a judge of the Supreme Court of the State, was formerly a resident of this town. Counting re-enlistments, 83 men were furnished by Mexico for the defence of the Uuion during the war of the Rebellion. This town was incorporated Feb. 13, 1818. As a plantation it was called Holmanstown. There is a Universalist society in the town, which sustains services. The number of schoolhouses is five, valued with land at $1,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $92,539. In 1880 it was $105,618. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2 per cent. The population in 1870 was458. In 1880 it was 403. Middle Dam, a post-office in Oxford County."], [371, "MILLTOWN. 363 IVxillOrd, in Penobscot County, is situated on the east bank of the Penobscot River, 13 miles N.N.E. of Bangor. It is bounded on the north by Greenbush, east by Greenfield, south by Bradley, and west by Oldtown. From the latter it is separated by Penobscot River. The Oldtown Falls, on this river, \" the best water-power in the United States,\" extends between these two towns. Milford was incorporated in 1833, taking its name from the mills on these falls. The surface of the town is generally level and swampy. It is drained by the Sunkhaze Stream with its numerous branches, and the Otter Chain Ponds and their outlet. The population is principally distributed along the Penobscot. The village is very pleasantly situated at a point opposite the lower end of Indian, or Oldtown, Island. There are in the town at this point six saw-mills manufacturing long lumber, shingles, etc. The attractive ness of the village is enhanced by the numerous elm trees set along the streets some thirty years since by some public spirited hands. The underlying and outcropping rocks are granite and slate. The soil is of sandy and gravelly loam. The principal crops are hay and potatoes. The forests are of an unusually dark color, consisting almost exclusively of pine, spruce and hemlock. The condition of the public roads is quite good. A bridge across the river here is 1,000 feet in length. Among the names of former citizens who merit to be remembered are Henry E. Prentiss, Samuel F. Hersey, Charles E. Dole and Simon Murphy. Milford sent 200 men to aid in the suppression of the Re bellion, losing one-fourth of the number. The town has a church of the Episcopal denomination. The num ber of public schoolhouses is four. The entire school property is valued at $4,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $178,614. In 1880 it was $174,709. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 24 mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 827. In 1880 it was 734. M^ilUjridg'e, in Washington County, is situated on Narra guagus River and Bay, 30 miles W.S.W. of Machias. It is bounded by Cherryfleld on the north, Harrington on the east, Narraguagus Bay on the south, and Steuben on the west. Narraguagus River separates it from the latter, while a smaller stream forms the boundary line on the east. Cherryfleld, the adjoining town up the river, has lumber and other mills, while Millbridge is its seaport. The village is at the mouth of the river, at the head of navigation. Lumber is brought down to this point from the mills at Cherryfleld in rafts. There are here three ship-yards, two boat-builders, sail and spar makers, a tin smith, and other small manufactures necessary to ship-yards or common to villages. There is also a factory for canning lobsters. The in habitants are largely engaged in fishing and coasting, as well as ship building and farming. This town was formed from parts of Harrington, Steuben and Cherryfleld, and incorporated in 1848. It has a Methodist and a Christian church, and nine public schoolhouses. The school property is valued at $3,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $209,747. In 1880 it was $304,779. The population in 1870 was 1,558. In 1880 it was 1,802. MilltOWn, a post-office in Washington County."], [372, "364 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. JVIilO is situated in the south-eastern part of Piscataquis County, 13 miles north-east of Dover, and 40 miles from Bangor. The Piscat aquis River and the Bangor and Piscataquis Railway run through the town east and west. Pleasant River from the south-west, and Sebec River from the north-west form a junction with the Piscataquis in the midst of the town. The last furnishes the power at Milo Village for grist, saw, shingle and spool-block mills, and a small woolen-factory. Considerable slate rock crops out along the stream. The surface of the town is agreeably diversified by hill and dale, and the soil is gen erally fertile. Milo maintains a flourishing cheese factory. The town was township No. 3, Range 3, and has an area of 21,920 acres. Mr. Jonathan Hastings early purchased the township from the State, and a Mr Wells, of Boston, became his partner. These con veyed the greater part to the settlers, and sold the balance to Russell Kittredge. A Mr. Snow, of Belgrade, having been pleased with the fertile intervals when roaming through the region as a hunter, sent his two sons, Moses and Stephen, just attained to manhood to dwell in this goodly land. They selected their lots in 1801 (probably) near the present bridge on Pleasant River. Mr. Benjamin Sargent, from Methuen, Mass., selected a lot on Piscataquis River, near the ferry, at the same time. All felled their first openings in 1802. Mr. Sargent was the first to bring in his family, which was done in 1803. The inhabitants were organized as Plantation No 3 sometime prior to 1820 ; and in 1823, it was incorporated as the town of Milo. The warrant for the first meeting was issued by Samuel Shepley to Theophilus Sargent. At this meeting Luther Keene was chosen town clerk. Mr. Elisha Johnson, the last of the twenty-eight voters present, died in 1878, aged above eighty years. Not far from the date of this incorporation, Captain W. A. Sweat built the dam across Sebec River, at the present village, and erected the first saw and grist-mill in town. Not long after this, Mr. Thomas White put in a fulling-mill and carding machine. A large amount of freight from Brownville slate-quarries and Katahdin iron-works are delivered at the Milo railway station. Among the prominent men of die town in addition to those already mentioned have been J. F. Califs, Ezra Kimball, Chester Huckins, S. B. Sprague, G. B. Crane and Hannibal Hamblin, physicians ; J. B. Everett, C. A. Everett, J. H. Macomber, jun., William P. Young, and M. L. Durgin, Jr., lawyers \\ the last two still remaining. The Baptists, Methodists, Free Baptists, Universalists and Advents each have an organization in town. Milo has a school fund of $1,300 arising from the sale of the reserved lots, and nine public schoolhouses, valued at $2,300. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $161,855 ; in 1880, $203,438. The population in 1870 was 930. In 1880 it was 934. MiltOll Plantation lies with its northern line about one mile south of the Androscoggin, midway between the eastern and western limits of Oxford County. Rumford bounds it on the north, Franklin Plantation on the east, Woodstock on the south, and Bethel on the west. The dimensions are about five and a half miles east and west by two and two-third miles north and south. The surface is broken and mountainous in the north-eastern and so nth- western parts, but more level, with some intervals along the courses of the streams in other portions. The principal streams are Concord River, with"], [373, "MI NOT. 365 Peterson Stream and its other branches. In the north-eastern part are Glines and Peaked mountains, with Mount Zircon at the extreme angle, and Mount Hemingway just across the northern border. In the south west, Bryant Mountain is the chief eminence. On the western slope of Mount Zircon is the noted Mount Zircon Mineral Spring. The centres of business are on Concord River, at the centre of the township where there are a saw-mill for long and short lumber, a shingle-mill, a boot and shoe shop and a schoolhouse ; and on Peterson Stream, at the western side of the township, where there are a steam saw-mill, a carriage-shop, a post-office and hotel. There is also a tub and pail handle factory in the plantation. The Oxford Mining Com pany is located here. The nearest railroad station is that of the Grand Trunk Railroad at Locke's Mills. The nearest railroad connection is at Bryant's Pond, by the stage-line from that place to Rumford. This plantation was organized in 1842. The Free Baptists have an organization here, and stated meetings. There are two public school houses ; and the school property is valued at $600. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $41,272. In 1880 it was $40,966. The population in 1870 was 258. In 1880 it was 270. IVIillOt, in Androscoggin County, was included with Poland and Old Auburn in the grant made by Massachusetts in 1765 to one Baker and others, and the tract\" was hence called Bakerstown. The entire territory was in 1795 incorporated under the name of Poland. In 1802, the part east of the Little Androscoggin River was incorporated under the name of Miuot ; and in 1842 Old Auburn was set off from this and incorporated. The name of Minot appears to have teen adopted in honor of Judge Minot, member of the General Court who aided in passing the act of incorporation. Minot, as now constituted, is bounded by Hebron, in Oxford County, on the west, on the north by the same town and Turner, on the east and south-east by Auburn, and on the south and south-west by Poland. These limits contain about 14,270 acres of land. The Little Androscoggin divides the town on the south-west from Poland, and furnishes a fine water-power at Mechanic Falls, the principal village. The first to start in paper- making on the Minot side of the river at this place were Ebenezer Drake and Ezra Mitchell, who erected a mill in 1851. They did a suc- cessful business until 1805, when the mill passed into the hands of A. C. Dennison & Co., and was rebuilt. There are also on the Minot side a clothing-factor v, a grist-mill, a boot and shoe factory, carriage-factory, etc. The \" Mechanic Falls Citizen,\" published in this village every Wednesday by Charles S. Allen, is an attractive sheet, devoted chiefly to local news. At Minot Corner is a grist-mill and a carriage-factory, a corn-packing factory, and lesser manufactures. At West Minot there is a flour-mill, saw and shingle mill, and cheese-factory. There is also a grist-mill on the Little Androscoggin a couple of miles above Mechanic Falls. The Grand Trunk Railroad runs near the river for the whole width of the town, a part of the distance within it, furnish ing convenient transportation for the villages on the river, while the Rumford Falls and Buckfield Railroad passing through West Minot connects with the Grand Trunk at Mechanic Falls. Bog Brook, the largest stream w-ithin the town, empties into the river near Mechanic Falls, called Bog Falls when first settled. The surface of the town is"], [374, "366 GjiZETTEER OF MAINE. generally uneven, and in some parts hilly, and affording some pictur esque scenery. The soil in most parts of the town is a strong loam, and somewhat stony. Near the river it is lighter. The two industries of manufactures and agriculture makes Minot a thrifty town. Moses, Josiah and Edward Little were the principal proprietors of the territory, from one or the other of whom most of the present titles come. As in several other towns bordering on the Pejepscot Purchase, there was a great deal of difficulty and ill-feeling in settling with the different claimants. Moses Emery, from Newbury, Mass., was the first settler, having, with his wife and infant daughter, arrived at Poland Empire in the spring of 1769. He first lived in a log house near the locality now known as Haekett's Mills, but two or three years later he removed to what is now Minot Coiner, where he had for a neighbor an Anasagunticook Indian. Wild game abounded in the vicinity. Once when looking for his cows, he was confronted by a bear and two cubs. He retreated backward endeavoring to lay hold of a club, and the bear followed grinning and growling with rage, so closely that he could feel her breath on his face. Finding that something must be done at once, he flung off his jacket in order to cast it over the bear's head. The sudden and peculiar action alarmed the bear, and she turned and went away. At another time he was attacked by a moose, and fled to a tree, the only defence available. The moose pursued, but being able to turn more quickly than the huge beast, he kept away from his pursuers horns and so close to his heels that he succeeded in cutting his hamstings with his pocket-knife. Again while out hunting he was attacked by a moose which his partner had wounded and which his dog was holding by the nose. At Emery's appearance, the moose freed himself from the dog by swinging him against a tree, then sprang directly at the hunter (whose gun missed fire) with a movement so tremendous that he would doubtless hive been killed had not another shot just in the nick of time from his partner's gun, laid the monster on the ground. Woodman Hill was first settled in i780 by John Allen, from Glou cester, Mass. ; Seth Sampson and Eliab Washburn came in 1789; and the Woodmans from New Gloucester, \u2014 the first in 1785. West Minot was first settled in 1781 by John Bridgham, who had been a captain in the Revolutionary army. Hersey Hill vicinity was first settled by the Freeman's and Bradford's, who were from Duxbury, Mass., in 1783. The Chandlers arrived soon after. Pottle Hill, was numerously settled by the Waterman's, Dwinals, Davis and Harris, in 1789. Mechanic Falls (Bog Falls) was first settled in 1836, by Dean Andrew, from Taunton, Mass.; soon followed Peter Thayer, Amos Chipman, and others. Chandler Freeman, a member of the Congregational church in Duxbury, instituted the first regular public worship on the Lord's Day, in 1784. The meeting was held in the house of his son, Chandler Freeman, at which the inhabitants of the northern part of the present town generally attended. Mr. Freeman, senior, usually read the the sermons, made the prayers and led the singing. The first church was established here in 1791 by the efforts of Rev. Wait Cornwell, of Connecticut. It was of the Congregationalist denomination. The Congregationalists, Baptists, Free Baptists, now have each a church in town ; the Methodists have two, and there is one Union church."], [375, "MONHEGAN PLANTATION. 367 In 1793 Rev. Jonathan Scott came to Bakerstown (including Minot) from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, in response to a letter of invitation which had been six months in reaching him. He was settled as pastor in 1796. The second Congregational church was formed in 1806. The first pastor was Rev. William Pidgin, installed in 1811. The West Minot and Hebron Congregational church was organized in 1802. Rev. Henry Sewall was ordained over it the same year. The first Methodist church was formed in 1795 by the labors of Rev. Joel Ketchum. The first Baptist church at Mechanic Falls was organized in 1857. The first pastor was Rev. A. K. P. Small. The first Univers alist church also was organized at Mechanic Falls in 1857. The first preacher was Rev. Z. Thompson. Dr. Jesse Rice was the first phy sician who practised in town ; but in 1800, losing three children by scarlet fever, which prevailed that year, he invited Dr. Seth Chandler, a native of Duxbury, Mass., to fill his place ; and when Dr. Chandler arrived, Dr. Rice ceased practice. He was afterwards much occupied in town affairs. Hon. Stephen Emery, judge of Probate in Oxford County, was a native of Minot. The most noted citizen of the to\\yn was William Ladd, a retired shipmaster, the first advocate of the set tlement of international disputes by arbitration. He was the principal founder of the American Peace Societv. The call for men in the war of the Rebellion was promptly met by Minot. She was represented by 206 men in the service, 133 of whom had been residents of the town. Eight of these enlisted in the quota of other towns. Some returned with broken constitutions, others were maimed for life ; of whom was Captain H. T. Buckman, who lost an arm. The loss during the war was 31 men. The amount of bounties paid by the town was $43,590. The total expenses were $49,284. The first schools were private. Of those who taught schools of this class are remembered Samuel Shaw, at the Centre, Master Bray, on Bradbury Hill, John Chandler and his sister, on Hersey Hill. Nathan Hanson taught the first public school in town. There are now nine public schoolhouses, valued at $11,000. One at Mechanic Falls, built a few years ago, is of brick, two-stories in height, cost $8,500, a part of which expense fell upon Poland, some of whose pupils it ac commodates. The valuation of estates in 1870, was $610,511. In 1880 it was $720,549. The population in 1870 was 1,569. In 1880 it was 1,704. MX)liarda, a post-office in Aioostook County. MOllliegan Plantation is an island situated just out side of Muscongus Bay, in Lincoln County. It lies 12 miles south-east from Pemaquid Point light, 23 miles from Matinicus rock, and 20 miles from Seguin light. Its own lighthouse has a flashing, white light, sweeping the entire horizon. The tower is of granite of the natural color. The island comprises a thousand acres of good, though rockyr land. Potatoes are the chief crop, and fishing the principal oc cupation of the Islanders. Monhegan has a bold shore on all sides, a large projection of rocks at its northeastward part, and has one good harbor. Station Hill, about 200 feet high, is the principal eminence. Broocher's Cave, about 8 feet in depth, is an object of curiosity."], [376, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 368 The name, Monhegan, is a corruption of an Indian word signifying \"Grand Island.\" It is the \" St. Georges' Island\" of Capt.\" George Weymouth, who landed here in 1605. Here, also, Popham's colonists landed on the 29th of August, 1607, when Richard Seymour, the chap lain, preached the first English sermon ever given in America. A plan has been formed for erecting a monument upon the island in commem oration of this event. Monhegan has, from their first knowledge of the coast, been a place of resort for European fisherman and traders ; and in 1618-19 part of a crew sent out by Sir Ferdinando Gorges spent the winter here. In 1626, Abraham Shurt was sent over by Elbridge and Aldsworth, the owners of the Pemaquid Patent, to purchase the island from Abraham Jennings, of Plymouth, paying for it \u00a350. It was depopulated in King Philips' war ; but was soon after resettled, and has ever since continued in a thriving condition. On the island \"Mananas,\" forming the western side of the harbor of Monhegan, are some markings on a rock, which by some antiquarians are believed to be letters made by Scandinavian explorers in ancient days. The characters are about eight inches in length, and are sunk quite deeply into the rock, upon a stratum which seems to be softer than the main ledge, which is horn 1 l.'iide. They all stand in proper parallels to each other, and obliquely to the course of the stratum. A cast was taken by Dr. Hamlin, which was sent to the American Antiquarian Society- at Copenhagan ; but the society have not been able to establish its human origin. Many incline to the opinion that the marks are only peculiar fissures in the rock. There was formerly an Advent society and meeting on the island ; and during the season of 1880 a church was finished and dedicated by the Methodists. Monhegan has one good public schoolhouse, which, with the appurtenances, is valued at $500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $24,345. In 1880 it was $10,305. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 24- per cent. The population in 1870 was, together with Marsh Isle, 165.\" In 1880 it was 133. MOliniOlltll the north-westerly town of Kennebec County, is about 16 miles from Augusta, and about 48 miles from Portland, on the line of the Maine Central Railway from the latter place to Water ville. The town is nearly square in its form ; and is bounded on the east by Litchfield and West Gardiner, north by Winthrop and Wayne, and having the town of Wales, in Androscoggin County, on the south, and Green and Leeds, in the same county, on the west. On or near the border lie five ponds, commencing at the south-east with Purgatory ponds, there follow Cobbossee Contee Great Pond at the north-east, Annabessacook at the north, Androscoggin Pond at the north-west, and parallel to and south-easterly of this, Wilsons' Pond. The latter takes its name from a man who was drowned in it by the Indians. The first settlers found a small tribe of these residing in town, who grad ually disappeared. In the western part of the town lies Cochnewagan Pond, whose outlet furnishes the power for the manufactories at Mon mouth Centre. There are a grain mill, capable of grinding seventy five bushels of wheat per day, and of corn, five or six hundred ; a sash factory, a saw-mill with capacity to saw from five to seven thousand' feet of boards per day ; a shingle-mill and carpenter's shop. The other"], [377, "MONROE. 369 villages are South Monmouth, East Monmouth and North Monmouth. At each of these is a post-office, and the Maine Central Railway has a station at tne Centre. At East Monmouth, on the outlet of Annabes sacook Pond, is a saw and shingle mill ; and on the outlet of Wilson's Pond at North Monmouth is a factory for making shovels, hoes, and axes, a grist-mill, and several lesser manufactures. The surface is uneven, but it is said that there is not a lot of waste land in town. The most extensive elevation of land is Oak Hill, from 150 to 200 feet high. The underlying rock is principally granite, and the soil a gravelly loam. Agriculture is the chief occupation of the inhabitants ; and excellent crops of hay, apples and potatoes are pro duced. The town also yields considerable quantity of beef cattle and dairy products. The first settlers are believed to be Thomas Gray, Joseph Allen, Philip Jenkins, Reuben Ham and Jonathan Thompson, who removed from Brunswick in the winter of 1777. Two years later arrived Icha bod Baker, John Welch, Alexander Thompson, Hugh Mulloy, and John and Benoni Austin. Peter Hopkins and James Blossom came in 1781, and some thirty others soon after. Among the latter were Gen eral (then Colonel) Henry Dearborn, Simon and Benjamin Dearborn and John Chandler. The territory was part of the Plymouth Patent. At the close of the Revolutionary war, General Dearborn became pro prietor of 5,225 acres of land in the township, upon which he erected farm buildings and mills, residing constantly upon his property for several years, and spending a portion of his time here for the remain der of his life. John Chandler came as an itinerant blacksmith, the poorest man in the settlement in respect to money. But his talents were of a high order, and he rose to be Major General of the State Militia, a representative in Congress, a United State's senator and later was appointed collector of the port of Portland. Among other residents were General James McClellan, afterward of Bath, Colonel Greenleaf Dearborn, of the United States army, General Ira Blossom, of Buffalo, New York, and Hon. Anson G. Chandler. During its existence as a plantation, it bore at different times the names of Freetown, Bloomingsborough and Wales. It was incorpo rated as a town in 1792, and at the suggestion of General Dearborn, received the name it now bears in commemoration of the battle of Monmouth, in which he bore a part. There are six church-edifices in town, belonging to the Congrega tionalists, the Calvinist and the Free Baptists, and the- Methodists. Monmouth Academy, founded in 1803, was for many years in. the front rank of the literary institutions of the State ; and' many eminent persons have here received a part of their education. Monmouth has besides fourteen public schoolhouses, valued at $5,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $592,068. In 1880 it was $609,042. The population in 1870 was 1,744. By the census of 1880 it is now placed at 1,520. Moiiroe lies in the northern part of Waldo County, 13 miles north of Belfast and 18 miles south-west of Bangor, on the stage-line from the latter city to Brooks. It is bounded on the east by Winterport and Frankfort, south by Swanville, west by Brooks and Jackson, and North by Newburgh, in Penobscot County. The surface is broken and hilly, but the soil yields well on cultivation. Much atten-"], [378, "370 GAZETEEER OF MAINE. tion has been given to fruit trees, and the town shows many fine orchards. It is drained by both the north and south branches of Marsh River; and on these are many water-powers. There is one saw-mill for long and short lumber, one grist-mill, a carding-mill, barrel-factory, cheese-factory, and other manufactures common to villages. A few years ago there were in operation in this town the following : \" Willis's Mills,\" on a fall of 15 feet on Marsh River, comprising a saw-mill, with the capacity of producing annually 400,000 feet of long lumber and 800,000 shingles, and a grist-mill with four sets of stones. On a fall of 10 feet, half a mile above, were saw, fulling, and carding mills. Half a mile above the last was a lumber and stave mill, and two miles above this were saw and shingle mills. On the outlet of Northern Pond was \" Thurlough Mill,\" with capacity of manufacturing annually 200,000 feet of lumber. On the outlet of the Thomas Chase bog, was a stone dam unoccupied; and half a mile farther down were board, lath, shingle and stave mills. On the outlet of a pond in Swanville were the \"Mayo Mills,\" including a first-class grist-mill. On the Emery Mills Stream was a saw and stave mill, a pail-factory, and still earlier, a grist-mill. At the outlet of Jones' Bog there was a grist-mill. Other privileges have never been occupied, and it is to be hoped that the future will see more of this waste power made useful to man. The settlements in Monroe commenced soon after those in Frank fort, which was settled about 1760. \"Lee Plantation,\" was the name by which these were known until 1822, when it was incorporated under the name of Monroe, in honor of Hon. James Monroe, at that time \u25a0president of the United States. The centres of business are Monroe Mills, or Village, and Monroe Centre. There is also a post-office at North Monroe. The Methodists and Free Baptists each have a church in the town. The number of public schoolhouses is thirteen, valued at $4,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $326,835. In 1880 it was $310,155. The popula tion in 1870 was 1,375. In 1880 it was 1,366. JNxOllSOll is situated in the south-western part of Piscataquis County. Shirley and Elliotsville are on the north, Howard Township on the east, Blanchard on the west, and Abbott on the south. The Bangor and Piscataquis Railway passes through the south-west corner, and the stage-line from Dexter to Moosehead Lake, through the centre of the town. Hebron, Monson, Doe and Spectacle ponds are the prin cipal bodies of water, the first and largest being 3 miles long and 1 wide. Child's Falls, where the water descends 75 feet are interesting. The Piscataquis River runs across the south-west corner. The other streams are Wilson's and the outlet of Hebron Pond, upon which, at the village near the centre of the town, are lumber-mills and a grist mill. Doughty Hill is the highest elevation of land. Much of the sur .face is low and stony, and has never been cleared, but perhaps half the area is a light, loamy soil, of an excellent quality for the crops raised \u2014 hay, oats, wheat and potatoes. The principal business is slate min ing, in which four or more companies are engaged. Monson Academy in Massachusetts, and Hebron Academy in Maine were each granted a tract 3 miles in width and 6 in length in the town ship, but being 7 miles one way instead of 6, a strip 1 mile wide was"], [379, "MONSON. 371 left at the north end unappropriated. The trustees of Monson Acade my, learning of this, petitioned and obtained it. Joseph Bearce felled the first opening in 1815, and the next sum mer \u2014 famous as the cold season \u2014 put in his first crop. George Doughty and Simeon Irish, with Mr. Bearce, brought in their families in 1818. Mr. Bearce put up a pair of Moose-horns on a stout pole to mark the point where a path turned off northward toward the centre of the township. The fork of these roads has ever continued at this point under the name of Moosehorns. Other early settlers were James Stinchfield, Captain Amasa Chapin, Captain Samuel Whitney, William A. Hyde, Calvin Colton, Deacons Lucius Hyde and Abel Good ell, Royal Day, Austin Newell, and Horatio Sherman. Messrs. Whitney, Hyde and Fay, made a clearing on the site of Monson Village, and built a dam in 1820, and a saw and grist mill in 1821. Deacon Andrew Cushman, Hiram Vinton, Isaac Tyler and Austin Newell came in 1822. In this year the town was incorporated. The first meeting was held, pursuant to a warrant from Samuel Pingree, Esq., at the dwelling-house of Messrs. Whitney and Hyde. In 1823, Alexander Greenwood, Esq., who sur veyed most of the townships in this vicinity, moved into Monson. His death occurred by the fall of a tree while he was superintending a drive, and the falls where the sad incident took place has ever since borne his name. A private school, free to all who could attend, was taught in the winter of 1821-22 by Deacon Lucius Hyde, in the house of James Stinchfield. The next Winter Father Sawer taught the first town school, and preached to the people on the Sabbath. Dr. Alpheus Davison, the first physician, settled in town in 1823. In 1824 other citizens of note came in, aniong whom were John Crafts, Solomon Cushman and Oliver Eveleth. In the same year the first post-office was established, F. F. Gates being the first post-master. The Doughty boys, succeeded by Benjamin Stinchfield, were the first mail-carriers, making the trip on foot between Monson and the next post-office at Guilford, 10 miles distant. In 1827, Deacon Thomas Fuller carried the mail in a carriage between Monson and Bangor. The town suf fered much damage in its woodland from the great fire of 1825. The Congregationalist meeting-house was finished and dedicated in 1831, and was the first house for public worship erected in the county. The Baptists also have a good church-edifice. In 1835, the farmers suffered much loss by the swindling operation of a real estate sharper. An academy was chartered in 1849, being the second in the county. On April 22, 1872, the fiftieth aniversary of the first town-meeting, a celebration was held at Academy^ Hall. It was presided over by Aretas Chapin, Esq., Rev. R. W. Emerson offered the prayer, and Mr. Charles Davison, a native of the town, gave an historical address. Rev. A. H. Tyler, and Hon. S. A. Patton, made interesting remarks, and preceptor William S. Knowlton read a witty historical poem. Hon. John H. Rice, member of the 38th and 39th Congress, and Hon. E. Flint, secretary of state in 1864, were formerly citizens of Monson. There are resident in the town four persons over ninety years old, and ten who are above eighty. From a population of 708, Monson furnished 84 men for the army of the Union. Of these 6 were killed on the field of battle, 16 died of wounds or disease, and 16 others were wounded."], [380, "372 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. No newspaper is now published in Monson, but many are read. At the date of the celebration, it was stated in the historical address that there were taken in town 5 daily, and 173 weekly newspapers, and 6 semi-monthly, and 84 monthly periodicals. Monson has seven public schoolhouses, valued at $2,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $134,520. In 1880 it was $159,461. The rate of taxation in 1880 is lj per cent. The population in 1870 was 608. In 1880 it was 827. IMontiCellO lies on the eastern border of Aroostook County, 12 miles north of Houlton, on the stage-line to upper Aroostook. It is bounded on the north by Bridgewater, south by Littleton, west by an unnamed township, and east by Wilmot, in New Brunswick. The north branch of the Meduxnekeag runs south-eastward through the midst of the town, receiving numerous short branches from the north ern side. Wallace Lake, in the northern part of the town, is the largest sheet of water, having an area of 30 acres. The surface of the country is somewhat rolling, but without hills. The rocks are limestone and granite. The soil is very good, yielding excellent crops. Hay, oats and potatoes are chiefly cultivated. Monticello Village is situated upon the Meduxnekeag North Branch, a little south of the centre of town. There are here a saw-mill for long and short lumber, a starch factory, and other manufactures common to villages. The nearest railroad station is at Houlton. The roads are generally very good. A bridge across the river at the village is 200 feet in length. It is con structed of spruce and cedar, with stone abutments. Monticello was incorporated July 29, 1846, having previously borne the name of Wellington Township. Among its valued citizens have been General Wellington, John Pond, Samuel Stackpole, and Peter Lowell. The Methodists have a church here, and sustain worship and preaching. The number of public schoolhouses is seven. The value of these, with land, is $750. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $138,585. In 1880 it was $149,273. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 15 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 760. In 1880 it was 965. MoiltSWrCag, a post-office in Woolwich, Sagadahoc County. M^OntVllle lies in the western part of Waldo county, 16 miles west of Belfast, on the stage-line from Augusta. The town is of diamond form, having its longest axis north and south. Freedom bounds it on the north-west, Knox on the north-east, Morrill on the east, Searsmont on the south-east, Liberty on the south-west and Palermo on the west. The superficial area is about 20,200 acres. The surface is broken by ledges, hills and mountains. Those having names on the county map are Otis Hill and Hogback Mountain. The last is a long elevation with several peaks, standing near the centre of the town. From its southern and eastern slopes flow streams tributary to St. George's River, while its western slopes feed the Sheepscot, and the northern the Sebasticook. Notwithstanding the broken condition of the surface, there is good grazing and tillage on hill, slope and valley. Granite is the prevailing rock. There are several ponds in the town, of which True's Pond in the southern corner is the largest, having, with three other small ponds connected, an area of about 4 square"], [381, "MOOSEHEAD LAKE. 373 miles. The town has several villages, \u2014 Montville Village or McFar land's Corner, Center, North, West and South Montville. There are in the town five saw-mills for the manufacture of long and short lum ber, one grist-mill, two cheese-factories, two carriage-factories, etc. This town was in the second grand division of the grant known as the \" Twenty Associates' Proprietary,\" the most of which was subse quently owned by Joseph Pierce, of Boston, from whom the settlers obtained their titles. The first settlement in this town was in 1778-9, by a Mr. Stannard, who moved away in a few years; so that the first permanent settler was James Davis, a Presbyterian minister, originally from Massachusetts. Two years later his two sons, William and Joshua, and a more distant relative, became residents. These all set tled in the neighborhood of what is now Liberty. These fam ilies intermarried, and the Davis families became so numerous that the plantation gained the name of Davistown, which it re tained until its incorporation. Following the last, came William Clark and Archibald McAHster, from Jefferson (then Ballstown) ; and about 1793, Timothy Barret, a native of Concord, Mass., took up his residence in Montville. He here maintained the life of a hermit till about 1844, and in 1847 he died at the supposed age of eighty-five. On February 18, 1807, the settlement was incorporated as Montville, a name derived perhaps from the mountain which marks the centre of the town. In 1799 came in Rev. Moses McFarlin. He was born in 1781, com menced preaching here in 1805, and continued to do so until within a few years. Another preacher, Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, a resident of Montville, in 1855-7, represented this district in Congress. The town has now four Free Baptist churches, and one Methodist church. The number of public schoolhouses is fifteen ; and their value, with appur tenances, is $4,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $389,945. In 1880 it was $362,692. The population in 1870 was 1,467. In 1880 it was 1,255. MOOSCliead Lake, the largest body of fresh water in New England, lies on the boundary of Piscataquis and Somerset counties, on the borders of a far-reaching wilderness. Its area is 120 square miles. It is 40 miles in extreme length, from 1 mile to 18 miles in width, and has about 400 miles of shore. Its borders, winding and irregular in their general outline, are further broken up into little coves, bays, points and peninsulas, and indented by the mouths of many streams. The water is of such depth that the lake can be crossed by steamers from end to end. For nearly forty years these craft have puffed along its forest-clad shores, towing rafts of logs from its ex treme parts to its outlet, and in later years conveying explorers, hunt ers, fishermen and summer tourists. At present there are five or more steamers on the lake, often accompanied by bands of music. Enclosed by its waters are many islands, and about its shores noble panoramas of mountain scenery. Of the islands, Sugar Island is the largest, con taining 5,000 acres, but uninhabited ; Deer Island, the next in size, contains above 2,200 acres, and has a cleared farm and a small public house. Eastward are seen the tops of mountains, solitary and in groups, among which are the Ebeeme Mountains, with Boarstone, Horseback and Spruceback ; and at the north east, almost touched by"], [382, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 374 one or more arms of the lake is a group of numerous hills ; and a little south-east of these are the twin peaks of Spencer Mountain, one of which rises to a height of 4,050 feet above the sea. In nearly the same direction 40 or 50 miles away, Kahtahdin, the loftiest of Maine's mountains, lifts his granite head. Not far from the lake, on the south west, Squaw Mountain looms grandly ; and beyond this, somewhat southward, are the high peaks of Franklin County, \u2014 mounts Abraham, Saddleback and Blue, with the New Hampshire group in the horizon. But most impressive of all is Mount Kineo, an abrupt elevation at the head of a peninsula that almost divides the lake in the midst. It is composed almost entirely of hornblende, presenting the largest mass of that rock known to geologists. On the side next the lake its precipi tous front rises to the height of 800 feet above the water. The surface of the lake itself is 1,070 feet above the sea, giving to the summit of Kineo an altitude more than 1,800 feet. From the south-western arm of the lake issues the noble Kennebec, forming its outlet. As a reservoir for a great river, the lake is of re markable character. The increase of depth in the spring is about 7 feet, and a dam commands a head of eight feet over the entire 120 square miles of its surface ; while the elevation above tide at which the river issues gives a succession of falls of great value for manufactures. The shores and islands are now gaining a sufficient number of good hotels, telegraphic communication is being established, and three dis tinct railroads are nearly approaching the lake. MOOSe River Plantation, in Somerset County oc cupies a tract at the junction of the angles of Dennicetown, Holden, Altean and Jackman plantation. It is 81 miles N.N.W. of Skowhegan, on the stage-road to Canada. The large ponds in Altean township here have their outlet in Moose River, which flows eastward through Long Pond into Moosehead Lake. At this plantation the stream affords a good water-power, which is occupied by a saw-mill and grist-mill. The first settlement was made by Samuel Holden in 1820. The settlement here was at first called Holdentown. It was organized as a plantation October 16, 1852. The plantation has a union church-edifice. It has one public schoolhouse, and other school property to the value of $400. The population in 1860 was 135. In 1870, 104. In 1880 no separate return was made in the census. M01*rill is situated in the central part of Waldo County, 6\u00a3 miles west of Belfast. It is bounded on the north by Knox, east by Waldo and Belfast, south by Belmont, and west by Searsuiont and Montville. The surface of the town is uneven, but with very little waste land. Morey and Rowe hills are probably the highest eleva tions, though these have no great altitude. The soil is sandy in parts, and in others clay loam. Hay and potatoes are the chief crops. The usual forest trees of the region thrive here. Cross Pond, in this town, contains about 100 acres, and another \u2014 Dolliff \u2014 about 50 acres. The chief water-power is at the village on the east on the Sacasawakie Stream. There are here shingle and stave mills, and a horse-rake fac tory. Morrill is on the Belfast and Kendall's Mills stage-line. The nearest railroad station is at Belfast. The town roads are very good. There is one bridge 120 feet in length, constructed of stone and limber."], [383, "MOSCOW. 375 This town was incorporated March 3, 1855; being named in honor of Hon. Anson P. Morrill, then governor of the State. The first set tlements were made by James Weymouth, Benjamin Smith, Joseph Coming and Nathaniel Cushman, in 1801 and 1802. They purchased their lands of General Knox, proprietor under the Waldo Patent. The climate of this town is regarded as quite healthful. There are four inhabitants past eighty years of age, and four between seventy and eighty. The Grange has a good building here, which is used as a town hall. There is a Methodist society in the town, and a Union meeting house at the village. The town has five public schoolhouses. The entire school property is valued at $2,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $133,099. In 1880 it was $122,098. The rate of taxation in the latter was for money tax, 42 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 523.

County, is situated on the eastern bank of Kennebec River, 25 miles N.N.W. of Skowhegan, on the stage-line to the Forks of the Kennebec. It is bounded on the north by Caratunk, east by Mayfield, south by Bingham and west by Pleasant Ridge Plantation. It is separated from the last by the river. The surface is very hilly. Dresser Hill is the most extensive elevation in horizontal area ; Baker Mountain is probably the highest, and Bab bitt Ridge is next to these. Chase, Little Chase and Minx ponds lie in the northern part. Others are found at the south-east corner, and along near the river are several smaller. Austin Stream is the princi pal water course, and into it discharge Chase and Gulf streams, Minx and other brooks. Near the eastern line of the town are \" Austin Falls,\" on the stream of that name, having a descent of 100 feet in half a mile. On these were formerly saw, shingle, clapboard and planing mills, which were burnt a few years since. Other powers and mills are Temple's Mills and Temple's Wagon Works, on a brook empty ing into the Kennebec River ; Bassett's Shingle Mill, on the east branch of Chase Stream ; Chase Mill on the same stream, near the centre of the town ; \"Great Falls,\" below, where the stream descends 30 feet; and on Carney's Brook is Carney's saw-mill. In all there are 19 available powers. The rock in general through the town is a hard slate, having in many places, veins of quartz yielding small quantities of gold. Three-fourths of the territory is still covered with heavy forest. The soil is good, yielding well in grain and other staple pro ducts of the region. Bingham is a post-office for the town. This township was a part of Bingham's Kennebec Purchase. Ac cording to Williamson, it was settled as early as 1773. The land was surveyed and lotted in 1812, at which time the inhabitants petitioned for incorporation under the name of Northfield. The plantation became somewhat known as Bakerstown, from the number of persons of the name of Baker among the inhabitants, though the original Bakerstown"], [384, "376 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. was in Androscoggin County. The act of incorporation was not passed until 1816 ; and the present name had taken the place of the one pro posed in commemoration of the event at the Russian city of that name in the year the petition was made. A Baptist church was established in the town in 1812. The Free Baptist is now the principal religious society in town. The public schoolhouses number seven ; and the entire school property is valued at $1,800. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $91,386. In 1880 it was $95,142. The population in 1870 was 528. In 1880 it was 522. MOSS Plantation lies on the south-western border of Aroostook County, 24 miles west of Houlton. It is on the stage line from Patten to Ashland. Merrill Plantation bounds it on the east, Hersey on the south, and Penobscot County on the west. The surface is quite broken and hilly. The highest elevation is called Matawamkeag Hill. Pichet Mountain, on the south-western boundary, also has considerable height. Rockabema Lake, lying a little north west of the centre of the town, is the source of the West Branch of the Mattawamkeag River. Its superficial area is 2^ square miles. There are at least 13 other ponds, large and small, in the township. The streams are the west branch of the Mattawamkeag, which winds through the town, receiving on its way the outlets of the several ponds, together with Upper and Lower Hasting's Brook, Mill Brook and others. A saw-mill making long and short lumber, a clapboard and a grist-mill, and a carriage-factory, constitute the manufactures of the plantation. The first settlements here were made in 1837, by Messrs. Lewis, Bradford and Brown. In 1850 a plantation was organized under the name Rockabema, which was changed to the present one in 1860. There is a Methodist society in the plantation, which has regular meetings and stated preaching. Moro has a good school house, and its school property is valued at $500. There are seven lots in the township reserved for public uses. The valuation of estates in 1880 was $46,693. The rate of taxation was 1^- cents on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 107. In 1880 it was 171. MOlint Abraham is an elevation of land in Franklin County, having several peaks, and occupying an entire township ; its base extending into Salem, the adjoining town on the south. Its height is 3,387 feet. Its summit is far above the limits of forest vegetation, and presents hundreds of acres covered with long moss, with a few arctic herbs. Mount AgameiltiCUS,\u2014 see article on York. MOUllt Blue,\u2014 see article on Avon. MOUllt CliaSe is situated in the northern part of Penobscot County, on the eastern side, 100 miles north of Bangor. It is on the stage-line from Winn, on the European and North American Railway, to Fort Kent. It was incorporated March 21, 1864, having previously"], [385, "MOUNT DESERT. 377 been Mount Chase Plantation. Its name is from the mountain in the northern part. In the north-west part are the two Shin ponds, con taining about 500 acres each, and Duck Pond, having an area of about 10 acres. These ponds are discharged into the Seboois River in the next range west. On this stream, just north of Sugar Loaf Mountain, in the next township, is a fall of 70 feet. The central and eastern part of this town is drained by Crystal Brook, on which, near the eastern side of the town, is a saw-mill. The town is well wooded with the usual hard and soft woods. The Methodists have a society in town, and have stated worship and preaching. Mount Chase has four public schoolhouses. The en tire school property is valued at $8,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $22,025. In 1880 it was $28,101. The population in 1870 was 262. In 1880 it was 310. MOUllt Desert, in Hancock County, formerly included the whole island, with some neighboring small islands. It now includes a belt across the middle of the island, with several small islands near it. The chief natural features of the town are its mountains, and an arm of the sea called Somes' Sound. This body of water is two miles wide at its mouth, and extends northward through the mountain ranges, affording a sail through the heart of the best scenery of the island. The considerable bodies of fresh water in this town are Long Pond, Echo Lake, or Deering's Pond, and Seal Cove Pond, the first 5 miles in length by 1-V in width, the others about one-half as large. The mountains are Pemetic (1,202 feet in height) ; the Bubbles, \u2014 North (845 ft.), and South (780 ft.) ; The Peak of Otter (506 ft.), The Beehive (540 ft.) ; Otter Cliff (112 ft.) ; The Cleft, North (610 ft.), and South (460 ft.) ; Jordan's Hills, North (340 ft.), and South (360 ft.) ; Brown's Mountain (860 ft.) ; Flying Mountain (300 ft.) ; Robinson's Mountain (700 ft.) ; Dog Mountain (670 ft.) ; and Carter's Nubble (480 ft.). The bowlder phenomena is exhibited in this towrn to a wonderful degree. There are wandering rocks of red and blue granite, trap, gneiss, mica schist, clay- slate, and fossiliferous sandstones. The greater part of the bed rock here called granite, is protogine \u2014 talc being sub stituted for mica. There is also considerable sienite in which is horn blende instead of mica, having veins of magnetic iron, arsenical iron and pyrites. The principal harbors are Somes', Pretty Marsh, and North East. Somesville, the principal village, is situated at the head of the sound, having an excellent harbor. There is quite a water-power at the place, furnished by Somes' Stream, on which are a saw-mill, woollen-factory, and grist-mill. There is also a steam saw-mill. The post-offices are Mount Desert (Somesville), North East Harbor, Pretty Marsh and Long Pond. Considerable business is done in the town in gathering ice, the annual crop being estimated at 12,000 tons. There are also several granite quarries, one of which employs about 40 men. The annual shipment of cut stone is estimated at 3,500 tons. It is said that there is not a level field in town. Hay is a small crop, and it brings a better price than in neighboring towns. Mount Desert Island was a familiar landmark to the early voyagers of the coast. Its name seems to have been first applied by De Monts in 1604. It was temporarily occupied by the French in that year. In"], [386, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 378 1608, the Jesuits, Peter Biard and Enemond Masse, established a mis sion on the island, supposed to have been located at Fernald's Point at the base of Flying Mountain, about two miles north of South-West Harbor. \" Here they constructed a fortified habitation, planted a gar den, and dwelt five years; entering with great zeal and perseverance upon the work of converting the natives to their faith.\" In 1613. the island having been granted to Madame de Guercheville, a lady of zeal ous piety, connected with the French Court, a colony of about twenty five persons, led by Saussaye, were sent out by her to join the two mis sionaries. Before their fort was fully completed, they were attacked by Argall, Governor of South Virginia, who captured or scattered both the colonists and their Indian friends. No attempt appears to have been made by the French to resettle the island until one Cadilliac received from Louis XIV. a grant containing 100,000 acres, bordering for two leagues on the bay near Jordan's River on the mainland, and the same on Mount Desert Island, including the smaller islands lying in the bay. He made a resolute attempt to hold his ground, but in 1713, after the cession of the whole of Acadie to England, he abandoned it. In 1785, however, his granddaughter, Madame de Gregoire, claimed of the General Court of Massachusetts the lands of her ancestor. The Court naturalized the claimant and her husband, and quit-claimed to them all but lots of 100 acres each for actual settlers. Having been abandoned by the French, in 1688, an Englishman named Hinds, with his wife and four children, lived here. The first permanent settlement was by Abraham Somes and James Richardson, in 1761. The first child, George Richardson, was born in August, 1793. The first mar riage was on August 9, 1774. Mount Desert Island became a Planta tion in 1776, and was incorporated as a town in 1789. In 1838, Bart lett's, Hardwood and Robinson's Islands were set off and incorporated into \" Seaville.\" Christopher Bartlett first settled on Bartlett's Island about 1770. The act incorporating Seaville was repealed in 1859, Bartlett's Island again becoming a part of Mount Desert. Eden was set off in 1796, and Tremont in 1848. The island contained an area of about 60,000 acres, of which Eden has 22,000, and Tremont half the remainder. The Congregationalists have a church in the town, and maintain a clergyman. Mount Desert has nine public schoolhouses, and its school property is valued at $3,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $158,069. In 1880 it was $160,803. The population in 1870 was 918. In the census of 1880 it was 1,017. Mount Katahdin is the highest of a numerous group of mountains near the middle of the eastern side of Piscataquis County. The base of the cluster, of which Katahdin is the highest peak, rests on the north-eastern bank of the West Branch of the Penobscot, at a point about 70 miles north-west of Bangor. Radiating to the north west and south-east are eight other lofty ridges, easily overlooked from the summit of Katahdin. Around this mountain, except on the north, are table-lands about 3 miles in width, rising with gentle acclivity to its base. The form of the elevation is somewhat ehptical, with its longest axis running nearly north and south ; with a circumference of eight or ten miles. Its sides are covered with granite rocks of a light gray color, which have broken and split into a thousand irregular"], [387, "MOUNT MICA. 379 forms, while others have crumbled into powder, forming the principal component of the soil ; the latter, with many of the rocks, being cov ered by a deep green moss. The trees grow shorter and shorter as the height increases, until they are mere dwarfs but a few feet in height, but with very long limbs, and trunks six inches in diameter at the ground. The trees find their limit, and are succeeded by the mountain-cranberry vine and blackberry bushes ; but at a mile from the top the vine ceases, and all shrubs disappear. Here the rocks, both pebbles and small bowlders, have a finer grain and a more blueish color than those lower down. The southern and eastern sides, by reason of general steepness and projecting cliffs, are almost impossible of ascent. The ascent has usually been made on the west or south west end, where, prior to 1816, the surface was inclined from 359 to 46\u00b0 to the horizon, and was extremely ragged with ledges, so that the distance from the upper margin of the table-lands, about 2 miles in a direct line, was much extended by the circuitous and zig-zag course necessarily taken. Sometime in the year mentioned, an enormous mass, starting from about midway of the height, slid down the moun tain, rending away many obstacles, so that the ascent was rendered much easier. The summit of Katahdin is a plain, inclining partially north-west ward, and formed of solid rock. The western portion is very smooth, as if ground away by drift ; but the rest is rough and broken, and the interstices filled with coarse gravel. The area of this plain is about 800 acres, being full half a mile in length, though much less in width. Over it all is spread a covering of light-gray moss. Katahdin is the highest mountain in our State, the altitude of its summit being 5,385 feet above the level of the sea. The height of Mount Washington, in New Hampshire, is 7,920 feet. Its landscapes extend from the high lands that border the Bay of Chaleur on the north-east to the White Hills of New Hampshire at the south-west ; and from the long ridge that forms the line of division between Maine and Canada on the north-west to peaks of Mount Desert Island, at the south, \u2014 the latter \" appearing to rise in a semi-globular form from the bosom of the ocean.\" \u2014 [Williamson.] The Indians have shown unwillingness to visit the summit of this mountain, professing it to be the summer resi dence of an evil spirit, called by them \"Pamela.\" This being, they say, rises in the beginning of snow-time with a great noise, and takes flight to some warmer region; and they tell, with fearful countenances, the story of seven Indians, who, a great many moons ago, were too bold, and ascended the mountain to its top, where they were killed by the terrible Pamola; \"for,\" say they, \"we never hear of them more; and our fathers told us that an Indian never goes up to the top of Katahdin and lives to return.\" MOUllt KilieO, see article on Moosehead Lake.

It is bounded on the east by Belgrade, south by Readfield, north by Rome and Vienna, and west by Fayette and Vienna. The territory was included in the Kennebec Patent. It was settled in 1774 by fam ilies from Readfield. The plantation name was Washington ; but as there was already one town of that name in the State it was in 1792 incorporated as the town of Mount Vernon, for the home estate of Washington. Nathaniel Dudley was the first representative to the General Court. Though high above the sea its hills are not high. Granite, lime stone and iron are found in town. The soil yields good crops of corn, potatoes, wheat, oats and apples. There is a large extent of fine pas turage, and the town is noted for the superior quality of its cattle. The numerous ponds in and about the town enhance the charms of its scenery. The largest are Long Pond on the north-east, Parker Pond on the west, and Crotched Pond on the south-west. There are also Flying Pond, at the north-west and Greely Pond in the southern part, Morse Pond, in the centre of the town, and others of less size. The business centres are Mount Vernon Village, at the north-west, and West Mount Vernon toward the south west. Scattered through the town on the various streams are five saw and shingle mills and one grist-mill. The manufactures consist of long and short lumber, sashes and doors, wood-pumps, furniture and coffins, rakes of various kinds, excelsior carriages, spool-squares, brooms, clothing, leather, harnesses, and boots and shoes. There are Free Baptist, Methodist andCalvinist Baptist societies in the town; but the church-edifices consist of the Union and the Free Baptist houses. Mount Vernon sustains a high school for a portion of the time. It has twelve public schoolhouses, valued at $7,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $397,034. In 1880 it was $393,381. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 1\\ cents on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,252. By the census of 1880 it is placed at 1,171. M^OUSe Island is an island, summer resort and post-office in Lincoln County. MOXle Falls are on Moxie Stream, about half a mile from its junction with the Kennebec River, some two and one half miles above the Forks. The stream is the outlet of a series of ponds closely joined, and all bearing the name of \" Moxie Pond.\" The height of this fall is 95 feet, over a bluff of schist, slate and limestone. MuSCle Ridge Plantation, in Knox County, consists of about a dozen islands, lying on the south-western part of Penobscot Bay at the verge of the ocean. The most noted of these islands is Dix Island, famous for its inexhaustible quarries of granite. These islands vary in area from half an acre to 75 acres. The inhabitants do a little farming, but are chiefly employed in the fisheries. The Dix Island Granite Company owns all the dwellings and other buildings, excepting those belonging to the fishermen. The population of Dix Island varies according to the demand for granite ; and the population of the entire plantation is quite variable. In 1870 it was 263. In"], [389, "NEALEY'S CORNER. 381 1880 it was 258. There is one schoolhouse, valued at $50. The val uation of estates in 1880 was $32,273. The rate of taxation was about 1 mill on a dollar. MuSCOllgUS Patent, see article on Waldo Patent Naples is situated in the north-western part of Cumberland County, between Bridgton and Lake Sebago. It is bounded on the north by Bridgton, Harrison and Otisfield, on the east by Otisfield and Casco, south by the latter, Lake Sebago and the town of Sebago, west by the last and by the south-western part of Bridgton. The town was made up from parts of Otisfield, Harrison, Raymond, Bridgton, and Sebago. It contains about 20,000 acres of land and water, the latter amounting to about 3,300 acres. The date of its incorporation is 1834. About one-third of Long Pond is within its limits, together with Brandy Pond, continuous through a short narrow with the former, and Trickey Pond. The streams are Songo River, 6 miles long, connecting Brandy Pond with Lake Sebago ; Crooked River, which forms the larger portion of the eastern boundary of the town ; Muddy River, outlet of Holt's Pond and Cold Stream Creek, connecting Cold rain Pond with Peabody Pond. The rock formation of Naples is granitic, having many dikes of quartz and trap rock. The granite is coarse and of little value as a building material from the preponderance of mica and felspar. There are localities, however, where a good quality of gneiss is quarried. There are also scattered over the surface many granite and gneiss boulders, much worn and some very large. These afford a limited quantity of building stone, and fine specimens of flesh colored felspar The surface of the town is pleasantly diversified with hill, valley, plain, and sheets of water. The soil varies from arid sand to tough clay; but the larger portion is a gravelly loam, containing many pebbles and bowl ders. The uplands afford excellent grazing, and hay is the principal crop. There is a canning factory of the Portland Packing Company at Naples Village, which creates a considerable demand for sweet corn. Other manufactures of the town are carriages, cooperage, men's and boy's clothing and boots and shoes. The strait uniting Long and Brandy ponds is spanned at Naples Village by a drawbridge. Except by a single lock on Songo River, navigation between the northern parts of Bridgton and Harrison and all parts of Sebago Ponds, a dis tance of about 25 miles, is uninterrupted. Naples is the terminus of the stage-line from the station of the Grand Trunk railway at Oxford. It is also on the stage-line from Portland to Bridgton. A narrow guage railway projected between the latter places will also pass through Naples, if constructed. There are a Methodist, a Congregationalist and a Union church in the town. Naples has eleven public schoolhouses, valued at $4,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $268,645 ; in 1880, $242,618. The population in 1870 was 1058. In 1880 it was 1008.

Carmel bounds it on the north, Hampden on the east, Dixmont on the west, and Winterport and Monroe in Waldo County on the south. The surface of the town is broken and hilly in parts, with some meadow. The soil is various, being clay in some portions and sandy or slaty in others. The prin cipal crops are hay and potatoes. Apple orchards have also been cultivated with success. The forest-trees are chiefly beech, maple, hemlock and spruce. The town is drained by the Soadabscook and its tributary streams. There are two saw-mills, two cheese factories, a carriage factory, etc. The occupation is chiefly agricultural, and much attention is given to cattle raising. The nearest railroad connections are at the stations of the Maine Central Railroad in Carmel and Hermon, adjoining towns. The post-offices are Newburg, at the north-east corner, North, Centre, South, and Newburg villages. This town is embraced within the limits of the Waldo patent, and was sold by Gen. Henry Knox (who inherited much of the patent) to Benjamin Bussey, who continued to be the owner of all the unoccupied land until his death. He held the land at so high a price that settlers came in slowly ; but after his demise more favorable terms were offered and the settlement since then has a rapid growth. Among tho original inhabitants we have the names of Freeman Luce, Edward Snow, Levi Mudgett, James Morrison, Abel Hardy, Thomas Morrill, Ezekiel Smith, George Bickford and Daniel Piper, who arrived about the year 1794. The Free Baptists, Methodists, Baptists and Christian Baptists have societies in the town, and there is a Union edifice for religious meetings. Newburg usually sustains three high schools at different quarters of the town during the fall and winter months. The number of public schoolhouses is fen ; and the value of the school property is estimated at $2,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $237,964. In 1880 it was $275,102. The rate of taxation in the latter year was $18.60 on one thousand. The population in 1870 was 1,115. In 1880 it was 1,057. NeWT CaSCO,\u2014 a post-office in Falmouth, Cumberland County. Newcastle, is situated near the middle of Lincoln county, on the peninsula between the Sheepscot and Damariscotta rivers. Jefferson lies on the north, Nobleboro', Damariscotta and Bristol, on the east, Edgecomb on the south, and Alna and Wiscasset on the west. The principal streams within the town are Dyer's River and Great Meadow Brook. The town is about six miles in length and four in breadth. The surface is varied more by galleys than by hills. There is a variety of soils, \u2014 generally well adapted to the usual crops, \u2014 of which hay is the chief. An expansion of Sheepscot River where it receives the waters of the two streams mentioned, forms \"Old Sheepscot Neck\" and contains an island of many acres in extent. A remarkable object of the town are the oyster beds on the northern shore of a peninsula in Damariscotta River, a short distance above the"], [391, "NEWCASTLE. 383 village. A bank of these shells 30 feet in depth, at some points of a cor-r responding width, extends the entire length of the peninsula. By whom or when deposited is not known ; but they are generally supposed to have been taken from the adjoining salt-water basin in the river by the Indians. Oysters are still found in these waters in small numbers. The principal village is at the lower falls and head of navigation on the Damariscotta river. Other small ones are Damariscotta Mills, on the river a short distance above the last ; north, on the eastern side, opposite Nobleboro' ; and another at Sheepscot Bridge, which connects the town with Alna, on the west side of the river. There are two grist mills, and three lumber mills, one of the latter at each of the three villages on the Damariscotta. Other manufactures are ships, leather, boots and shoes, match splints and large quantities of bricks. The Knox and Lincoln railroad has a station at the village and at South Newcastle and Damariscotta Mills, the first 18 miles from Bath. Newcastle was settled at about the same time as Pemaquid and Arrowsie, and was for 35 years or longer called Sheepscot Plantation. The first settlement was made on a neck on the Sheepscot side of the peninsula, occupying an area of about 400 rods in length and 92 in width. A street ran the whole length of the neck, upon both sides of which, at uniform distances, were laid outt he two acre lots into which the homesteads were usually divided. On these, traces of cellars have been found ; and not far away the remains of an extensive reservoir. Easterly from these were the farms, consisting of 100 acres each, reached by a road called the \" King's highway,\" \u2014 which also led to the woods and the mill. The latter was on a stream called Mill Brook, or river, about a mile from the settlement. On the highest point, opposite the falls and overlooking the town, was a small fort. Sullivan, in his history of Maine, says, quoting from Sylvanus Davis, a resident pro prietor : \"There were in the year 1630, 84 families, besides fishermen, about Pemaquid, St. Georges, and Sheepscot, and 50 of these were said to be on the Sheepscot farms.\" In 1665, Robert Carr, George Cartwright and Samuel Maverick, commissioners appointed by the Duke of York, arrived at Sheepscot, this being within the limits of the territory claimed by him under his patent from the English crown. The house of John Mason, at which they met and organized a government, is supposed to have been in the Sheepscot plantation. Mason, about 1649-50, purchased of the sagamores Robin Hood and Jack Pudding, a considerable tract about his resi dence. The commissioners erected the whole extensive territory [see history of Maine, ante.], into the county of Cornwall, applied the name, New Dartmouth, to the whole region about the plantation, and estab lished the line between this and Pemaquid. The commissioners vested the civil power in the county in a chief constable, three magistrates or justices of the peace, and a recorder. The justices were Nicholas Raynal, Thomas Gardiner and William Dyer. This government lasted until 1675, when the first Indian war desolated the region. When Arrowsie fell beneath the tomahawk, a little girl escaped, flying 15 miles through the woods to New Dartmouth, giving the inhabitants a timely alarm. A ship, which William Phips, a Boston citizen, had been building here, was almost ready for sea ; and instead of taking to Boston a cargo of lumber, as he had intended, he took the affrighted inhabitants and their goods, and conveyed them to a place of safety. Phips, who was"], [392, "384 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. a native of this region, was afterward knighted by the Kirg, and became a distinguished governor of Massachusetts. Three years later the war had closed, and many inhabitants returned. Commissioners John Palmer and John West, appointed by the Duke's governor at New York, and Colonel Dungan, arrived at Sheepscot in 1686, and began to lay out the town in lots as before. Their administration was obnoxious to the inhabitants, but was soon terminated by another French and Indian war in 1688. The settlements were again laid in ruins, continuing in this condition for nearly 30 years. In 1718, Rev. Christopher Tappan, of Newbury, sent two men to inclose a portion of the territory in this region, which he had pur chased of Walter Phillips and other claimants as early as 1702, \u2014 some of these being settlers who had been driven away by the Indians. Phillips' title was derived from the Indian sagamores by three several purchases, in 1661, 1662 and 1674. Tappan himself arrived in 1733, and began to survey his lands onthe Sheepscot side of the town ; laying out 45 one hundred acre lots, two of which were allotted to the first settled minister and the first parish. The latter still remains in the hands of the first parish. Tappan's title to the east of Mill River was disputed by William Vaughan and James Noble, who held under the Pemaquid patent (which see) and Brown claim (for which see NobleboroiifjhA) A sharp litigation followed, and Vaughan's title pre vailed; and the lands there are held from him to this day ; while on the west side of the river the titles are derived from Tappan. The town was incorporated in 1653, being named, probably, in compliment to the Duke of Newcastle, known as a friend to the American colonies. The town was first represented in the General Court by Benjamin Woodbridge in 1774. The census of 1764 shows a population of 454 persons. The Newcastle National is the only bank in town. It has a capital of $50,000. The Rev. Alexander Boyd was employed to preach at Sheepscot soon after it was made a district, having been ordained by the Boston Presbytery in 1754. He was dismissed in 1758. After a lapse of 18 years, during which Messrs. Ward, Lain, Perley and Benedic were employed as preachers, Rev. Thurston Whiting was settled (1776), and a Congregational church formed. There are now two Congregational churches, an Episcopal, an Advent, and Methodist church in the town. Lincoln Academy, located in the village, was incorporated in 1801, and is still flourishing. Newcastle has 14 public schoolhouses, valued together with other school property, at $4,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $697,981. In 1880, it was $827,108. The population in 1870 was 1,729. In 1880, it was 1,534. Newfield, in the north-western part of York County, is a part of the tract conveyed to Francis Small of Kittery, Indian trader, by Captain Sunday, a sagamore in the region in 1668. The tract lay between the Ossipee and Little Ossipee rivers, which when laid out into townships were generally spoken of as the five Ossipee towns. From all the information now attainable, it appears that the larger part of landed estate in town is held by titles derived from the Francis Small and Cape Ann rights. A survey of this tract was made in 1778, by John Wingate, and the number of acres found to be 14,543. The ter ritory was enlarged in 1846 by the annexation from Shapleigh of 600"], [393, "NEW GLOUCESTER. 385 or 800 acres in the south-eastern part of the town, below the Little Ossipee river. For a number of years it was called Washington Plantation. At its incorporation in 1794, the present name of New- field was adopted. Of the early settlers, Nathaniel Doe came in the year 1777 ; Zeh- ulon Libby and Paul McDonald in 1777 ; Leander Nelson came in 1780, settling in West Newfield. Rev. John Adams moved his family here in 1780. William and Eben Symmes of Ipswich, Revolutionary soldiers, came about 1780. Samuel Dam of Waterborough, built a. grist-mill and saw-mill at what is now Newfield village, between 1780 and 17S4. Josiah Towle came from Epping, N. H., to Hiram, thence to Limerick, and in 1790, to \u2022Newfield, where he opened a store. He was the first representative to the General Court of Massachusetts. William Durgin came from Limerick with his father and a brother about 1798. He built a saw-mill and grist-mill at the upper village, and in 1801 a store. Other Revolutionary soldiers who settled in Newfield, were Robert Thompson, William Libby, Nicholas Kennison, Stephen Wood, James Heard, William Campernell, Simeon Tibbetts, and others. Tenmen from the militia were called to the defense of the seaboard in the- war of 1812. Newfield furnished 96 men for the army during the war of the Rebellion, 20 of whom were killed in battle or died of wounds or sickness. Other eminent citizens were Thomas Adams, son of Rev. John Adams, Gamaliel E. Smith, and Nathan Clifford ; and of natives who became eminent in their sphere are Caleb R. Ayer and Ira T. Drew, prominent lawyers of the York County bar, Charles W and Horace Turtle, formerly connected with the Harvard College Observ- atory, the former connected later with the Boston bar, and the latter in the navy. James Ayer, M.D., settled in town in 1805, Dr. M. L. Marston settled in 1824, Dr. Stephen Adams in 1829. The business centres are Newfield village on the Little Ossipee river in the eastern part of the town, West Newfield, a little west of ; the centre, and North Newfield midway of the line on the northern side. At the village are two grist-mills, lumber, stave, shook and planing mills, carding machine ; West Newfield has saw, grist and stave mills, one of each ; at North Newfield, the principal business is the mining and preparation of a mineral used in the manufacture of stone, earthen, porcelain and glass ware, and for polishing lustre. Silver and iron have been mined in town, but not with profit. Lime- stone is found in a few localities. The Free Baptists and Congrega- tionalists have each a church in town, and the Methodists have two. The town has eight public schoolhouses, valued at $5,000. The valua tion of estates in 1870 was $298,895. In 1880 it was $264,577. The population at the same date was 1,493. In 1880 it was 995.

Bald Hill in the northern corner of the town is the highest eminence. There is much good interval land, and the uplands are generally loamy. The hills especially, have many drift rocks of the cobble-stone size. The town is one of the best for farming purposes, and being well- wrought, has generally a thrifty appearance. There is a mineral spring of some note in the town called the Centennial Spring. Lily Pond, about half a mile square, lies a little north of the centre of the town ; and in the north-western part is Sabbath-day Pond, two miles lone by half a mile wide. The principal streams are Royal's River, Harris Brook, and the outlet of Sabbath-day Pond. The Shakers have a village at the western extremity of the town, with about 1,000 acres of excellent land, which they cultivate with their usual industry. Near by the village, on the outlet of Shaker Bog, is a small lumber and grist-mill belonging to this community. The other business centres are Upper Gloucester, New Gloucester P. O. near the centre of the town, Gloucester Hill, a mile and a half west of the last, Cobb's Station on the same line, at the eastern side of the town, and Fogg's Corners, in the southern part. The manufactures are lumber, carriages, boots and shoes and tin ware. Upper Gloucester occupies the side of an elevated plain, which slopes off from the village towards the south and west into miles of lowland, bog, forest and interval. The township was granted in 1735 to 60 inhabitants of Gloucester, Mass., whence its name with the prefix \" New.\" There were 63 equal shares, of which the odd three were respectively, as usual, for the first minister, the support of the ministry, and the schools. A number of families very soon built a dozen log-houses on Harris Hill, and a saw mill near by, \u2014 of whom Jonas Mason was the first. It was in the autumn 1742, that the household goods of the pioneer settlers were landed at the mouth of Royal's River and poled up the stream on rafts to the bridge which had been erected in 1739. Anew war with France broke out in 1744, continuing until 1751 ; during which the hostility of the savages caused the abandonment of the settlement. In 1753 some of the inhabitants returned and built a block-house 100 rods south-west of the meeting-house on the lower side of the road. For six years it was a home, a fort and a church. The long slots in the walls for the guns also served as windows ; and the huge fire on the hearth cooked their food and lighted the apartment at night. [See Haskell's Centennial Address.] Ruined mills and cabins were re-built, and in 1756 a new roadw-as cut by Walnut Hill to North Yarmouth. The first grist-mill was put up in 1758. Colonel Isaac Parsons and John Woodman came in 1761. The erec- tion of a schoolhouse, and the arrival of the first schoolmaster and minis ter occurred in 1764. The name of the latter was Samuel Foxcroft ; and his descendants still occupy the fine old mansion built by him. The first meeting-house was built in 1770, and stood until 1838. It was a quaint, but ambitious edifice. It had a square tower on the south ve<t end, and a porch on the other. Twenty-six windows in two rows let in the light through their 8 by 10 panes. Galleries on three sides rose to the height of the preacher's eyes, as he stood in the lofty pulpit under the threatening sounding-board. Wardens with long staffs watched for sleepers, and sometimes the reminder of the knobbed"], [395, "NEW LIMERICK. 387 end was far from gentle. Holes in the floor served for spittoons, and gave ample ventilation. Seats turned upon their hinges during prayer to afford space for the wide skirts of the ladies, and dropped down with a rattling chorus and many a bang at the welcome \" Amen.\" The town's stock of powder was kept in small closets within the sacred desk, ready to be served out to the members of the congregation on Sundays and at their homes on secular days, in case of an Indian attack. If the pulpit was not the driest place in town, it was in some danger of becoming the hottest. The town was incorporated in 1794; from 1795 to the organization of Oxford County in 1805 the courts were held here alternately with Portland ; and New Gloucester therefore early became one of the most distinguished towns in the State, much of its present elegance being due to the people thus brought into its limits. Hon. Peleg W. Chandler of Boston was a native of this town. William Pitt Fes senden spent his boyhood here ; and his brother Hon. S. C. Fessenden, a member of the 37th Congress (1860) was born here. Their father, General Samuel Fessenden, began the practice of law in this town. The mother of Hon. W. W. Thomas, of Portland, was born in New Gloucester in 1779. She was a daughter of Judge Widgery, and a lady of great benevolence and public spirit. Elias Thomas, to whom she was married in 1802, died in 1872, being above one hundred years of age. The religious societies in town are the Congregationalists, Bapt ists, Free Baptists, Universalists, Shakers, each of these have churches, some of which are superior edifices. The Bailey House school at New Gloucester village is well spoken of. New Gloucester has eleven public schoolhouses, and its school property is valued at $5,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $848,905. The rate of taxation in 1879 was 9\u00a3 mills on the dollar. The town has no debt. The population in 1870 was 1,496. In 1880 it was reported at 1,382. New HarhOr,\u2014 a post-office and small village in Bristol, Lincoln County. New Limerick, in Aroostook County, is in the second range, and is adjoined by Houlton on the east, Ludlow on the north, Linneus on the south, Smyrna and Oakfield Plantation on the west. The town embraces a half township, and contains numerous ponds. New Limerick Lake, in the south-eastern part of the town, is about three miles in length, and one-half mile in greatest width. Drew's Lake occupies about one and a half square miles in the south-west part of the town. Cochran's and Bradbury's lakes lie in the north-west, Gould's in the midst of the western part, and others smaller are found in various quantities. Davis Stream and its branches, forming the outlets of the sheets of water mentioned, are the principal water courses. This stream is the south branch of the Meduxnekeag River. There is on Davis Stream, in the south part of the town, a large tan nery ; and near by is a saw-mill. On the outlet of Drew's Lake is a saw-mill and a starch-factory. This is a fertile township, and abounds in excellent timber. The rocks are granite and limestone, the latter"], [396, "GjiZETTEER OF MAINE. 388 of superior quality. The stage-line from Houlton to Patten passes through the town. The Baptists have a society, and sustain preaching a portion of the time. New Limerick has five public schoolhouses ; and its school property is valued at $1,000. The population in 1870 was 308. In 1880 it was\"590. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $43,450. In 1880 it was $100,720. Newport lies on the western border of Penobscot County, 25 miles west-north-west of Bangor. Corinna bounds it on the north, Stetson on the east, Plymouth on the south and Palmyra, in Somerset County, on the west. The surface is pleasantly varied by hills and valleys, but is without lofty elevations. Newport Pond lies nearly in the centre of the town. It has an area of about 8 square miles, and a circumference of about 15. This excellent reservoir receives the over flow of Stetson Pond, lying in the next town eastward, of two ponds in Dexter, and of one in Corinna. Its own outlet forms the east branch of the Sebasticook River. The dam might readily be raised so as to give eight feet of storage on the pond, which would then afford 252 horse powers gross on the whole fall for ten hours a day, 312 days in the year, or about 10,000 spindles. The natural fall at this place is 14 feet in 78 rods. No damage has ever been done by freshets. A good quality of granite for building is abundant here. . The principal centre of business is Newport village on the outlet of the pond, in the south western part of the town. Other centres are East and North Newport and Wedgewood Comers. Newport village, and East Newport have stations on the Maine Central Railroad, which also sends a branch from Newport village to Dexter. The manufactures at the village consist of lumber (2 mills), car riages, meaj and flour, marble, granite and slate work, iron work, boots and shoes, etc. The soil of this town is fertile, and the main business of the inhab itants is agricultural. The buildings generally in the rural parts of the town, as well as in the villages, show tokens of thrift. The place is likely to have a greater growth in years to come. The settlement of this town was commenced about the year 1808. Among the earliest settlers were William Martin, Isaac Lawrence, Nathaniel Burrill, John Whiting, Daniel Bicknell, John Ireland and Elam Pratt, most of whom came from Bloomfield and purchased the land upon which to settle, of Benjamin Shepard, of that town. The settlement was called East Pond Plantation until its incorporation under its present name, June 14, 1814. The denominations which have societies here are the Methodists and the Christian. All hold their meetings in the Union church. There is in the village a circulating library of 500 volumes. The number of public schoolhouses is ten, valued, with their appurtenances, at $8,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $540,927. In 1880 it was $378,168. The population in 1870 was 1,559. In 1880 it was 1,451. New Portland lies on the western border of Somerset County, 20 miles north-west of Skowhegan. Lexington bounds it on the north, Anson on the south, Embden on the east, and Freeman, in"], [397, "NEWRY. 389 Franklin County, on the west. The township is square in its form, but somewhat larger than the standard size of six miles square. The surface lies in large swells, but generally without the steepness that precludes cultivation. The soil is of granitic origin, and yields well with good dressing. Gilman Pond Mountain, rising northward from the northern border, has a considerable height. Gilman Pond lying on the northern line has an area of about one-half a square mile. Lily- Pond, on the western line, is still smaller. The principal stream is Seven Mile Brook or Carabasset River, which rises about the base of Mount Abraham at the north-west, and flows into and through the town in a general s mth westerly course. It receives as a tributary in the eastern part of the town, Gilman Stream, flowing south from Gil man Pond, and in the south-western part, Lemon Stream. The powers are at North New Portland, on Gilman Stream ; at West New Port land, on Lemon Stream near its junction with the Carabasset; and at East New Portland, near the junction of Gilman Stream with the Carabasset. The manufactories at these different points are as follows : at North New Portland are a lumber-mill, a grist-mill, hand-sled, salt box, rake and carriage, canning-factories., etc. ; at East New Portland, a saw and grist-mill ; at West New Portland, a saw-mill, two grist mills, churn, cloth-dressing, carriage, boot, shoe and moccasin factories. The town has much attractive scenery, and the villages wear an ap pearance of thrift. New Portland is on the stage-line from North- Ansoh, terminus of the Somerset Railroad to Dead River. The township, with that of Freeman on its west, was granted by Massachusetts to the sufferers by the burning of Falmouth (now Port land) by Mowatt in 1775. It was organized as a plantation in 1805, and as a town in 1808, receiving its name from the town whose mis fortunes it partially remedied. David Hutchins, of Chelmsford, Mass., was the first settler, probably, in 1785. In 1786 Josiah Parker arrived from Groton, Mass. He had served in the fourth regiment of Mas sachusetts militia, in the war of the Revolution, and was honorably discharged at West Point ; and he subsequently bore an honorable and arduous part in the affairs of this town. He was ninety-six years of age in 1856. Another valued citizen was Andrew Elliott, who was one of the earlier settlers, a very public spirited man, who lived to the advanced age of one hundred and three years. Ebenezer Richardson, from Sedgewick, came in the same year, and John and William Churchill, from Bingham, in. 1788. Later came Eben Casley, from Gorham, Samuel and Benjamin Gould, Solomon Walker, Charles Warden, from Woolwich, and John Dennis, from Groton, N. H. The town, in 1809, voted an invitation to Beniah Pratt to become the parish minister, which he accepted, but was not settled. In 1815, Samuel Hutchins, son of the first settler, was called and settled, and had a portion of the ministerial lands. Both these divines belonged to the Free-will Baptists, who were the principal sect at first. The churches are now two Free Baptist, a Methodist, a Universalist, a LTnion, and a Congregational Union church. The number of public schoolhouses is sixteen, and the value of the public school property $3,500. The population in 1870 was 1,454. In 1880 it was 1,271. The valuation in 1870 was $400,590. In 1880 it was $466,250. NeWTy lies in the western part of Oxford County, just north"], [398, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 390 of Androscoggin River. It is bounded on the south by Bethel, east by Hanover and Rumford, north by Andover, north-west by Grafton and west by Riley. The town is compound in its figure, but is bounded by straight lines. Its area is 26,000 acres. Bear River crosses the midst of the town from north-west to south-east, entering the Andros coggin River where, by a northward bend, it touches the south line of Newry. Near the line on the west side of Bear River, rises Mount Will to a height of 1,588 feet. Along the western base of this moun tain flows Sunday River, coming from Riley at the west, then turning southward. West of this river, and near the southern line of the town is Barker's Mountain, 2,551 feet high. North-west of this is Black Mountain, with another considerable peak south of it. On the western border near the north is Stow Mountain ; north-east of this is Sunday River White Cap ; south-east of White Cap is Bald Mountain ; and on the opposite side of Bear River, in the northern corner of the town, is Great Ledge Hill. In the eastern part of the town is Puzzle Moun. tain. Except where divided by the rivers all these mountains, except the last, join at their bases. Granite ledges are numerous. Along the two rivers are excellent intervals, and the hill slopes afford good pasturage. Hay is the largest crop. There is much forest, in which flourish the trees common to the State. Both the principal streams have falls suitable for small mills ; and on Bear River, near North Newry post-office, are a saw and grist-mill. Near the mouth of Bear River, on the Androscoggin, is a steam saw-mill ; but it is situated on the south side of the line in the north-western angle of Hanover. The settlements are along the streams. The stage-line between Bethel Hill and Lake Umbagog runs along the eastern bank of Bear River. The nearest railroad station is that of the Grand Trunk Railroad at Bethel village, near the centre of that town. \u25a0 o ' \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 The first settlements were made here in 1781, by Benjamin Barker and his two brothers, from Methuen, Mass., and Ithiel Smith, of Cape Elizabeth, Me. These families were plundered by the Canada Indian: in 1782, and removed to other parts until after the establishment of peace. The first sale of the township proved abortive, and it reverted to the State. In 1794 John J. Holmes of New Jersey purchased it, taking the deed in his sister Bostwick's name, wherefore it for awhile bore her name. It was also included under the general name of Sudbury-Canada, applied to several towns about here. It was incor porated June 15, 1805, receiving the name of Newry in deference to some of the settlers, who had emigrated from Newry, in Ireland. A person of large observation after a prolonged visit to this town in its early days said \"I have travelled over a great part of Europe and the United States, and I believe the people here to be the most honest, industrious and sober of any I ever met with.\" There is a Methodist Society in the town and a Union meeting house at Newry Corner. There are six public schoolhouses ; and the school property is valued at $1,190. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $116,894. In 1880 it was $90,663. The population in 1870 was 416. In 1880 it was 337. NeAV SliarOn is situated in the southern part of Franklin County, and is the most easterly of its towns. It is bounded on the north by Industry, west by Farniington, south by Chesterville, and by"], [399, "NEW SHARON. 391 Vienna in Kennebec County, and east by Mercer in Somerset County. The length of the town from north to south is about 12 miles. The area is 28,600 acres. The surface is agreeably diversified, but is with- out high hills or deep valleys. Cape Cod and Hampshire Hills are the chief elevations. The rocks are gneiss, slate, an impure lime- stone, with perhaps, some granite. In the woods are found a large variety of trees, \u2014 maple, beech, birch, ash, hemlock, fir, spruce, pine, poplar, cedar, and others. The soil is sandy in the river valleys ; next above this is a clay loam, and away from the river a sandy loam or other light soil. It is quite productive ; and numerous small fortunes have been gathered from the profits of New Sharon farms. Much of this money has gone to develop new towns and States in the West. The village of New Sharon is one of the prettiest in the State. It is situated on both sides of the Sandy River, where a natural fall is in- creased by a dam, and the stream spanned by an expensive covered bridge. The railroad station at Farmington, 9 miles distant, and the station in Belgrade, 16 miles distant, furnish the nearest railroad con- nections ; but a narrow-gauge railroad to Farmington is contemplated. There is a daily stage from New Sharon to both these places. Mc- Gurdy Pond, 1 mile long by 1\u00a3 mile wide, is the largest sheet of water. The streams are Sandy River, which crosses the middle of the town toward the north-east, and Muddy Brook, running southward to Sandy River through the northern part. Gold is found near the bed of this river, but full test of the quantity has not yet been made. The vil- lages are New Sharon, on Sandy River near the centre of the town ; Week's Mills, on Muddy Brook, two or three miles north of the last ; and East New Sharon, half-way from the centre to the south-east of the town. There are operated in New Sharon three saw-mills, a grist- mill, and chair, shoe, shovel-handle, carriage and clothing factories. The township of New Sharon was granted to Prince Baker and others, by the State of Massachusetts, in 1791, and was settled so rap- idly that in 1794 it was incorporated. Mr. Baker himself was the earliest settler. He was followed by Nathaniel Tibbits, Benjamin Chambers, Benjamin Rollins, James Howes and Samuel Prescott. This township is stated by Williamson [Hist, of Maine, vol. 2, p. 514] to have been a part of the tract granted to the representatives of Capt. William Tyng and his company in consideration of their services and sufferings during a dangerous pursuit of the Indian enemy upon snow shoes during the first winter of Queen Anne's war (1734). It was therefore first called Tyngstown. It was afterward named Unity, finally taking its present name of New Sharon. Abel Baker built the first mills at the falls in 1801. They after ward passed into the hands of Abel Mayhew, by whom they were re built and much improved. The bridge across the Sandy River at this village was first erected 'about 1809 or 1810, and has since been rebuilt with solid stone abutments. The town hall is a substantial brick building, two stories in height. The climate of the region is salubrious ; and there reside in the town five persons who are upwards of ninety years old, eighteen who are between eighty and ninety, and sixty-three who are between sev enty and eighty. New Sharon furnished 166 men to the Union cause, during the war of the Rebellion. George Dana Boardman, the devoted and distinguished missionary to Burmah, was a native of this town."], [400, "392 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Dr. J. F. Pratt, a physician of Chelsea, Mass., was for a considerable time, a resident of this town. The town has a library of above 1,000 volumes. There are four church-edifices in town, one of which belongs to the Congregationalists, one to the Methodists and two to the Free Bap tists. New Sharon has sixteen public schoolhouses ; and the total value of school property is estimated at $1,550. The estates in 1870 were valued at \"$481,434. In 1880 they were set at $470,917. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 36 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,451. ' In 1880 it was 1,306. NeW Sweden Plantation is situated in the north- eastern part of Aroostook County, 62 miles north by north-west of Houlton and 8 miles from the New Brunswick railroad station in Caribou. It is bounded on the east by K. Plantation and by Caribou, south by Woodland Plantation, west by Perham Plantation, with un named townships on the north-west and north. It was formerly Town ship No. 15, Range 3. The surface is little varied by hills or deep valleys ; the highest hill being Mount Barmett. The soil is fertile and free from rocks. The forests consist chiefly of maple and cedar. The crops principally cultivated are rye, potatoes and buckwheat. Bearsley Ponds, the largest containing scarcely one-fourth of a square mile, lie in the western part of the town. The streams are the Little Mada waska, which runs south-eastward across the northern part, and Bears ley Brook, a tributary of the river, coming from Bearsley Ponds ; the South Branch of Bearsley Brook, coming from a small pond in the south-east, and the North Branch of the Caribou, which crosses the south-west corner of the township. There are two steam shingle-mills and one water-power saw-mill, in adjoining plantations. The roads are of average goodness ; and there is one bridge 300 feet and one 60 feet long. This plantation was settled under the direction of Hon. W. W. Thomas, Jr., Commissioner of Immigration, July 23, 1870. It was organized into a plantation April 6, 1876. In 1880 the plantation numbered 517 Swedish inhabitants. The Swedish colony at this date had overrun the limits of New Sweden, and scattered over the adja cent portions of Woodland, Caribou and Perham, numbering in all 787 souls ; an increase of 14.74 per cent, in a decade. In 1880 the colony had cleared 4,438 acres of wild land, built a church, town-house, five schoolhouses, three mills, 163 dwelling-houses, and 151 barns; and had also constructed 42^ miles of road. They owned 164 horses, 659 head of horned cattle, 530 sheep, 175 swine, and 1,920 poultry. The colony is a thrifty and successful agricultural community, who have already attracted to the State 1,000 Swedish immigrants in addition to its own numbers. The members of this colony brought with them $100,000 ill cash. Mr. E. H. El well, of the Portland Transcript, in his pamphlet on Aroostook. published in 1878, gives the following description of a Swedish house in this plantation, (Mr. Peterson's). \" It is one of the larger and better class of houses, and shows the Swedish style of building to good advantage. It is built of hewn logs, clap-boarded, with the interstices between the logs calked with moss \u2014 a warm and solid building."], [401, "NEW VINEYARD. 393 The plan of the house struck us as being very convenient. The entrance hall does not run through the building, but nearly across the front, having little depth, but considerable length. In the rear of the hall, opposite the outer door, entrance is given to a large, square reception-room, which occupies the. middle of the house. On each side of this are two smaller rooms, entrance to which is gained from the hall, and also from the central room. These smaller rooms are used as kitchen, sitting-room and bed-rooms. In one of these we were shown a wooden, round topped chest, in good preservation, which we were told is one hundred and eighty years old.\" * * * Pastor When \" has built up in a corner of one of his rooms the tall, brick, chimney-like stove of Sweden.

Ten lots in this township are reserved for schools and other public purposes. The three public schoolhouses were erected at a cost of $500. The value of the school property is estimated at $900. The valuation of estates in 1880 was $22,041. The rate of taxation was 16.053 on $1,000. [See close of article on Civil History, in the first part of this work]. NeW Vineyard is situated in the eastern part of Franklin County, having Strong on the west and the latter and Freeman on the north-west, Industry on the south-east, the latter and Farmington on the south, Industry and Anson in Somerset County on the east and Strong, Freeman and New Portland in Somerset County on the north. The town has a remarkable outline. There are two right-angled notches on the north-western side and three on the south-eastern. There are also nine projecting right-angles. A range of mountains crosses the town from south-west to north-east, dividing the waters of Sandy River from those of the Carrabasset River on the north. There are no less than nine peaks in the town and on its borders, of which Herrick mountain is probably the highest. The scenery in some parts is strikingly- beautiful. Porter's Pond, lying on the middle border and partly in Strong, is the principal sheet of water. The streams are Porter's and Barker brooks, and Hillman, Fairbank's and McLeny mill streams. The rocks are granite boulders, and out-cropping and under lying limestone. The soil is generally good, especially in the northerly and easterly sections. New Vineyard Village (formerly known as Vaughn's Mills) near the middle of the town, is the principal business centre. New Vineyard has two saw-mills, and a grist-mill carried by water-power, and a spool-mill by steam-power. The manufactures are salt-boxes, shovel-handles, dowels, brush blocks, spools, carriages, shingles, clapboards, flour and meal, boots and shoes, brooms, etc. New Vineyard is 10 miles from Farmington, on the stage-line to King field, East New Vineyard is the other post-office. New Vineyard township was purchased from Massachusetts by an association of persons belonging in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., together with Jonathan Knowlton of Farmington, who acted as their agent ; hence the plantation took the name, \" New Vineyard,\" from the first. Daniel Collins and Abner Norton, having previously commenced im provements, moved in with their families in 1791, thus becoming the first settlers. These were soon followed by Samuel Daggett, Jonathan Merry, James Manter, Ephraim Butler, John Spencer, Cornelius Norton, David Davis, John Daggett, Benjamin Benson, Joseph Smith,"], [402, "394 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Henry Butler, Herbert Boardman, Charles Luce, Henry Norton, Wil liam Farrand, Seth Hilman, Ezra Winslow and Calvin Burden. Set tlements were soon after commenced north of the mountains by people mostly from Middleboro, Mass. Among these occur the names of George, Eleazer, Paul and Remiah Pratt, Elias Bryant, Simeon Hackett, Jabez Vaughn and Cephaniah Morton. The town was incorporated in 1802. There are churches of the Congregationalists, Methodists and Free Baptists in the town. New Vineyard has ten public schoolhouses, valued with other school pro perty, at $2,000. The estates in 1870 were valued at $228,812. In 1880 they were valued at $202,867. The population in 1870 was 755. In 1880 it was 627. NoblebOrOUgll is situated near the centre of Lincoln County on the eastern shore of Damariscotta Lake. Waldoboro' bounds it on the east, Jefferson on the north and west, Newcastle on the west of the southern part, and Damariscotta on the south. The area is about ten thousand acres. Damariscotta Lake extends along the whole western side of the town, and a broad area of the lake, called Mus congus Bay, penetrates to the centre. From the head of this bay a canal, excavated many years ago, extends southward for nearly 2 miles. A section of Pemaquid Pond extends from the south-east corner nearly 2 miles toward the centre of the town. On the eastern line is Duck Puddle Pond, and in the north-eastern corner is Cook's Pond. The soil of the town is favorable to agriculture, in which pursuit the inhabitants are chiefly engaged. The centres of business are Noble borough and Damariscotta Mills. There is a station of the Knox and Lincoln railroad in each place. The distance from Bath is about 22 miles. The manufactures consist of lumber, boots and shoes, organs, etc. There is a saw-mill at each village. Nobleborough originally formed a part of the possession of Elbridge and Aldsworth, under the Pemaquid patent. It was settled at about the same date as Damariscotta, viz., about 1640. This territory was a favorite resort of the Indians for hunting and fishing ; and they held possession here with great tenacity, remaining in solitary families long after the white man, whose advance they vainly- resisted, had com menced their settlements in the town. After the Indian wars closed, the inhabitants were involved for many years in a harassing contro versy about the title to their lands, which was not sett ed until 1814. The territory was claimed under the Brown right, which had its origin in a deed from Capt. John Somerset (known to us as \" Somerset\") and Unnongoit, Indian sagamores. Its southerly boundary ran from Pemaquid Falls to Brown's house, on the eastern shore ; and from this line extended northerly for 25 miles, including Muscongus Island, and covering the most of Bristol, all of the towns of Nobleborough and Jefferson, and part of the town of Newcastle. Brown in August, 1660, conveyed to one Gould and his wife eight miles square, abo.it midway of the original grant. A survey was made at a later period of the dif ferent claims; and William Vaughan, and, later, James N'oble, claimants under this right, improved all the lands lying on both sides of the Damariscotta Fresh Pond, to the head of it ; also on the west side of the river half-way to Sheepscot, and on the easterly side half-way to \" Pemaquid Pond.\" Vaughan either commenced or revived the settle-"], [403, "NORRIDGWOCK. 395 ment under Colonel Dunbar about 1730 ; but the growth was slow, as it appears that at the beginning of the Revolution, there were only 30 men heie capable of bearing arms. James Noble, who had married the widow of Vaughan, pursued the claim until 1765, when he and his coadjutors were dispossessed, though they did not then wholy abandon their claim. The town was incorporated in 1788, being named for a son of the proprietor, Colonel Arthur Noble, who was killed in a battle with the French at Midas, Nova Scotia in 1747. It included Damariscotta until 1847, when the latter was set off. Rev. Adoniram Judson, father of the noted missionary of the same name, was settled over the Baptist church in Nobleborough in 1819. The Baptist denomination still preponderates in the town, having three churches, and the Methodists, one. There are twelve public school houses in Nobleborough, these with other school property being valued at $6,500. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $287,867. In 1880, it was $239,295. The population in 1870 was 1,150. In 1880, it was 1,142. NorridgeWOCk lies on the Kennebec River in the south- ern part of Somerset County. It is bounded on the North by Madison, east by Skowhegan, south by Fairfield and Smithfield and west by Mercer and Starks. The township is somewhat larger than the stand- ard size, having an area of about 26,000 acres. The form is nearly square. The Kennebec River runs through the town from the north- west angle to the centre, thence by a right-angled bend north-easterly to Skowhegan. There is a village on each bank of the river at this bend, connected by a good covered wooden bridge, 500 feet in length. The town is quite hilly, but with fine intervals, the uplands also being fertile. The soil on the river is a light sandy loam, and back from it a rocky loam. The flora is unusually interesting. The forests are in due proportion to the territory, and contains the trees common in the region, with a predominance of hard-wood. Limestone is found in abundance but mixed with slate. There is also a fine quality of granite formed near the southern line of the town. The water-powers are at Bombazee Rips, on the Kennebec 3 miles above Norridgewock Bridge, with a natural fall of 8 feet, and on Sawtelle's Mill Stream, at South Norridgewock, with a fall of 10 feet in 20 rods. There are in this village a saw and a grist-mill, a carriage and a furniture factory, granite works, etc. Norridgewock Village is 5 miles south-west of Skowhegan. It is on the line of the Somerset Railroad, which has a station at South Norridgewock. The two villages are separated only by- the river. Norridgewock was formerly the seat of a powerful tribe of Indians, and the name of the town is a corruption of the name of their village. It is said to have been the name of an early chief, and to signify \" smooth water.\" The French had a Roman Catholic missionary here as early as 1610. Sebastian Rasle, a Jesuit missionary, became resident at the place in 1687, laboring faithfully for the Indians in the manner of his con.ictions until his death in 1724. He had here a dwelling and a neat chapel ; and his influence over the Indians was strong and beneficent. They became earnest worshippers in the little chapel, and their relations among themselves greatly improved, while their barbar ities in war were lessened. The French, wishing to secure the Indians"], [404, "396 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. as their allies, did all they could to strengthen them as a force to be wielded against the English whenever the interests of France de manded. After the first Indian war, all the forays of this tribe upon their settlements were attributed by the English to the influence of Rasle. He was the counsellor of the tribe in their conferences with the English, and the latter sometimes found themselves outwitted in their treaties. They made repeated attempts against Norridgewock and to capture the priest, but without success ; and in 1723 a strongbox belonging to Rasle, and containing his dictionary of the Indian language and other papers were brought away. The dictionary and documents are now preserved in Harvard College library. The papers taken dis closed some of the plans of the French government, and were useful in the conduct of the war. A chapel of fir-wood had been erected at Norridgewock as early as 1646, being the first church ever erected on MONUMENT OF RASLE, NORRIDGEWOCK. the Kennebec River. It was burned in 1674 by a party of English hunters, but in 1687 was rebuilt by English workmen sent by the Massachusetts government from Boston for this purpose, according to treaty stipulations. This village stood about 3 miles above Norridgewock bridge, on what is now called \" Old Point,\" situated near the confluence of Sandy River, with the Kennebec. The locality is beautiful. The rude huts includ ing that of Father Rasle were set in two parallel rows, running north and south, a road skirting the bank of the river, while between the rows of cabins was a street 200 feet in width. At the northern ex tremity stood the church, while at the lower end was a chapel dedi cated to the Virgin Mary, for use on secular days. Whittier in his"], [405, "NORRIDGEWOCK. 397 poem of \" Mogg Megone,\" graphically describes this village and the worship of the dusky inhabitants. A more effective force than had yet been sent left Fort Richmond (in what is now the town of Richmond) on the Kennebec, on the 19th of August, 1724. It consisted of 208 men embarked in seventeen whale boats. Near the mouth of the Sebasticook River, opposite what is now the village of Waterville, they landed, leaving the boats under a guard of 40 men. They marched up the eastern bank of the river to Skow hegan, where Captain Harman crossed at the Great Eddy with 60 men, and followed up the river on that side for the purpose of cutting off the retreat of those who might be at work in the corn fields on the Sandy River; while Captain Moulton, leaving 10 men with the lug gage, marched with the remaining 98 men, for the doomed village, reaching it on the 24th. Such of the Indians as were at home were engaged in their cabins ; but as the English entered one end of the street an old Indian discovered them, and gave the war-whoop, which brought out the warriors tc the number of about 60. The conflict was sharp, short and decisive. Thirty warriors were slain and fourteen wounded, the remainder escaping across the river and in other direc tions with the squaws and children. The church was pillaged, and one of the three Mohawks who were with the expedition, enraged by the fall of his brother during the fight, turned back and set the chapel and village on fire. Rasle engaged in the defence, firing from his cabin upon the assailants, and himself fell in the fight. Roman Catholic authorities have charged that the body of their missionary was shot through and through, and was scalped and otherwise mutilated. The church bell was recovered by the Indians from the ruins and buried in the woods. It was subsequently found by an English party, and has since been preserved in the collections of Bowdoin College. It weighed 64 pounds. From this time Norridgewock was forsaken by the tribe, who removed to Canada. Though the superiority of this region was known, it was still too far from other settlements ; and no persistent attempts were made to occupy it until after the Revolution, though some visited the place in 1772. Benedict Arnold, in October 1775, passed over this ground with his army on the way to Quebec. No sooner was the war at an end, than the settlers began to come in ; and in June, 1788, there were a sufficient number of inhabitants to obtain incorporation as a town. The town has always been thrifty, though many suffered much loss in 1837, by land and timber speculations. On the creation of Somerset County in 1809, Norridgewock was made the shire town, continuing to be such until 1871, when the county seat was changed to Skowhegan. The first meeting-house was erected in 1794, at the public expense. The court house was built in 1820, and in 1847 remodeled at a cost of $7,000. The present bridge across the river at this point was built in 1849, at a cost of $11,000. John S. Tenney and John Ware were esteemed citizens of Nor ridgewock. It was, also, long the home of Hon. John S. Abbot, a suc cessful lawyer of the Suffolk bar, very much esteemed by his brethren, and recently deceased ; William Allen, Esq., long and favorably known in the middle and northern parts of the State, resided here most of his life ; and it is now the residence of Sophie May, the popu lar authoress of many valuable books for girls ; and of Hon. Stephen"], [406, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 398 D. Lindsey, member of Congress for the third district. Norridgewock sent 132 men into the army of the Union during the war of the rebel lion, of whom twenty-five were lost. There is here the excellent school of H. F. Eaton (Eaton Family School), with a high, grammar and primary schools in the village. The number of public schoolhouses in the town is sixteen, valued at $4,000. The churches are the Congregationalist, Methodists, Advent and Bap- tist. The population in 1870 was 1,756, In 1880 it was 1,491. The valuation in 1870 was $641,982. In 1880 it was $581,847. The rate of taxation in the latter year, .029 on a dollar. North Auburn, a village and postroffice in Auburn, An. droscoggin County. Noi'tll Bei'Wdck, is situated in the south-west part of York County, and is bounded on the north and east by Sanford, south by South Berwick, west and south-west by Berwick, and north-west by Lebanon. It contains 18,579 acres of land. Its principal sheet of water is Bonny Bigg Pond on the northern side, containing 1,600 acres ; and its streams are Great Works, Negutaquet and Little Rivers. The surface of the country is rather uneven. Bonny Bigg Hill is the highest elevation. The soil, though stony, is fairly productive. Farming is the principal occupation of the inhabitants. The principal village is at the south-west part, at the junction of the Portland, Saco and Ports mouth and Boston and Maine railroads. The North Berwick Woolen Company have a fine brick mill on the Great Works River, at the village. It is 120 feet long and three stories in height, and has an engine of sufficient power to carry the mill in case of drought. Forty looms, six sets of cards, and thirteen spinning jacks are operated, which turn out daily 1,500 yards of flannel, beside blankets, and employ about 80 hands. The capital is $100,000. At the foot of Bonny Bigg Pond is a saw, grist, shingle and clapboard mill. On the Negutaqueit are the Hussey Agricultural Works, manufacturing farm implements. Other factories are a carding and yarn mill, a box and shook mill, several saw mills, stove polish factory, and many other lesser indus tries, including an extensive brick-yard. Several good powers on the streams are unimproved. The Baptists, Free Baptists and Friends have each a church in the town. The town has 16 schoolhouses valued at $8,090. The valuation of 1870 was $572,927 ; in 1880, $637,334. The population in 1870 was 1,623 ; in 1880, 1,801. The rate of taxation is 14 mills on a dollar. The town was originally a part of Berwick, from which it was set off and incorporated in 1831 ; and its history is chiefly included in that of the parent town. Settlements were made in it about 1630, probably by the Morrills and Purintons. Thomas Hobbs, the ancestor of the Hobbs family in the town, in 1735 procured from Nicholas Morrill a deed of land on the west side of Doughty's falls. He had previously acquired property at the mouth of the Negutiquet, where he built a saw-mill. The Husseys and Buffums were also among the earliest settlers. Other names of early settlers are Hall, Randall, Staples, Quint, Ham mond, Hurd, Chadbourne, Libbey, Twambly, Weymouth, Ford, Fernal, Hanscom and others. A few notable incidents not in the general history of the Berwicks"], [407, "NORTHFIELD. 399 may be mentioned. A young daughter of Peter Morrill, while gather ing hemlock for a broom, was slain by Wawa, a chief of the Pequakets. On a promontory in Bonny Bigg Pond tradition says that a captive white woman was kept one winter by the Indians. During the winter she gave birth to a child, which from the scanty food and exposure, was feeble and sickly. The Indians compelled the mother to father pine fagots, with which they burned the babe to ashes. In the sprinc she was taken to Canada and sold to the French, from whom she was ransomed and returned to her friends. Around the pond many stone hearths are found. They consist of a bed of stone about four feet in circumference, upon which the Indians built fires for cooking. On the north side of the outlet in a ravine, near the west border of the pond, was found the greatest number of these hearths, \u2014 and here probably was a village of the Indians. Near by is the field where they raised their maize. In plowing the field, many stone-chisels, gouges, pestles, \u25a0sinkers, hatchets, arrow-heads, etc., have been brought to light. Having been settled chiefly since the Revolution, Berwick had little opportunity to show her patriotism until the breaking out of the rebel lion. Then her sons responded nobly to the calls for men, and the tax payers cheerfully voted generous bounties. The number sent out under the various calls was 146, and the amount of bounty paid was $48,000. The Friends appear to have been the earliest religious society in town. Soon after 1742 a society was gathered which still exists. The first meeting-house stood on the Oak-woods road, south of Bonny Bigg. The present house is about a mile south-west of the village. Among the eminent men who were born in this town are President Paul Chadbourne, of William's College, Hon. Ichabod Goodwin, ex governor of New Hampshire, and Darius Morrill, member of Congress. North East Harbor, a post-office and small seaport on Mount Desert Island, Hancock County. Northfield lies a few miles south-west of the centre of Washington county, and 10 miles north by north-west of Machias. Marshfield, Whitneyville and Centreville lie on the south of this town. Machias River runs in a south-easterly course through the south- western part of the town, \u2014 receiving in its course Old and New streams and Bog Brook, the outlet of Bog Pond, \u2014 which lies in the eastern part of the town. The size of this pond is 2 miles long by one wide. The stage-road from Machias to Calais passes northward across the eastern part of the town, just west of the pond. The principal settle- ments are along this road in the southern part of the town, and on the road south of the pond. The principal water-powers are Holmes' Falls, on Machias river, and those on Bog Brook. Others are called Dick's Falls, College Rips, and Brown's Rips : On Bog Brook near the pond is a board, lath and shingle mill. The surface is quite uneven, being broken by ledges and hills. Harmon's Pinnacle is 500 feet in height, and Elwell's Mountain, 350 feet. The soil is variable, clay loam in some parts and gravel in others. The crops chiefly cultivated are hay, oats, wheat and potatoes. Rock maple, beech, juniper and pine are found in the still plentiful forest."], [408, "400 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Northfield was incorporated March 21, 1838. It was originally No. 24 in Bingham's Penobscot purchase. The town sent 22 men into the army of the Union in the war of the rebellion, \u2014 of whom 9 were lost. Three of its inhabitants are above 80 years of age. The neigh borhood library here contains 117 volumes. There is a Methodist society in the town, and the Congregationalists have a church edifice. The number of public schoolhouses is 3, \u2014 valued, with land, at $600. The population in 1870 was 190. In 1880 it was 161. The valuation in 1870 was $52,947. In 1880 it was $33,311. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 3f per cent. North Haveil? in Knox county, is situated at the entrance of Penobscot Bay, 12 miles east of Rockland. In consists of an island about 8 miles long and from 4 to 5 wide. The town was formerly a part of Vinalhaven,from which it is separated by a strait, or thorough fare, about 1 mile in width. It is the north Fox Island, and was incorporated by the name of Fox Island in 1846. The name was changed to the present one in 1847. Thomas Pond, the only considerable sheet of fresh water, is 1 mile lone and 1\u00a3 mile wide. There is one saw mill carried by tide power. The hills are Mount Nebo and Pigeon Hill, each having a height of about 700 feet. The surface of the town is not greatly varied in elevation. The soil is gravelly. The bed rock is of a black color. Fishing and farming are the principal occupations. Waterman's Iron Spring on this island has some celebrity. There are four small villages and one post-office. The Baptists have the only church edifice on the island. The town has a library of 200 volumes. The number of public schools is 6, and the school property is valued at $2,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $152,594. In 1880, it was $151,652. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2 and 1 tenth cents on the dollar. The popu lation in 1870 was 806. In 1880 it was 755. Northport, in Waldo County, lies on the west side of Pen obscot Bay, and adjoins Belfast on the south. Lincolnville bounds it on the south-west, and a portion of Belmont, is in contact with it on the north-west. The town projects somewhat more than its neighbors into the bay, and its eastern part, therefore, enjoys more of the cool sea-breezes. There are 9 miles of sea-coast, and the width of the town is about 4 miles. There are many hills, \u2014 Temperance, Nudgett's, Bird's, etc. ; and there is near the shore one bluff in particular from which a fine view of the bay can be obtained. Spruce Head, projecting into the bay on the south, is a noticeable point from passing vessels. There are 3 small villages, all on the coast. Brown's Corner occupies a cove near the northern line of the town, and Saturday Cove is a pleasant little village in the more southern part. It has its name from the landing here on Saturday of the Rev. John Murray, a distinguished Presbyterian divine of the Revolutionary period. Wesleyan Camp Ground is a picturesque collection of summer cottages in a noble grove on a projecting portion of the shore, about half a mile south of Brown's Corner. Formerly the people who met here in their annual camp meetings lived in canvas tents, but gradually they began to build cot-"], [409, "NORTH YjiRMOUTH. 401 tages, and spend several weeks in the place. There are now about 300 cottages, and a large hotel which, in the summer of 1878, enter tained upwards of 3000 guests ; and while the annual religious meeting in August still remains the leading feature, the place is becoming a popular watering place. A stage-line connects the villages with Belfast and Rockland. During the warm season the steamers touch at the wharf, and there are daily excursions from the shore and river towns. It is already entitled to be called the Cottage City of the Penobscot. Saturday Cove is also finely situated, having a pleasing view of the bay and a cosy hotel. The village has a retired position, which, for some, increases its attractiveness. The number of old people in the town gives evidence of the salu brity of the climate. The oldest inhabitant was Mrs. Rebecca Pend leton, who died in 1863, at the age of 1U4 years and 6 months. There are none but small streams in the town, Saturday Cove and Little Harbor streams being the largest. Pitcher and Knight's ponds, closely connected bodies of water, extend along a large portion of the southern boundary. The manufactories of the town consists of two saw-mills, one of which manufactures lumber, and cooper's wares, and the other adds treenails to these productions. There is also a boat builder, and furniture, cooperage and carriage factories. The North port Cheese Factory produces large quantities of cheese that finds readv sale. Farming and fishing are the chief occupation of the people. There has been a large increase of improved stock in town within a recent period. The soil is clay and sandy loam. Granite is the prin cipal rock. The first who made attempts to settle in this town were Thomas Burkmar, Samuel Bird, David Miller, Colonel Thomas, Stephen and John Knowlton, H. Flanders, Adam Patterson, Mark and John Welch, Zachariah Lawrence, Captain Ebenezer Frye, Major Benjamin Shaw, David Alden, Henry Pendleton, and Micaiah Drinkwater. They arrived but a short time prior to the Revolution, and had scarcely more then begun to put their plans for homes into execution, when th^y were called to the more exciting life of the army. There were no further settlements until the peace, when immigrants began to appear from all parts of the State. During the war of 1812, a descent by the British from Castine was made upon the settlers of Northport, and several citizens were plundered. Some shots also were exchanged along the shore, but none of the inhabitants were killed. One shot, that imbedded itself in the house of Jones Shaw, has since been one of the notable things of this shore. Northport was incorporated Feb. 13, 1796. There are in the town a Christian, a Baptist and Methodist church. There are 9 public schoolhouses ; and the school property is valued at $2,700. The population in 1870 was 902. In 1880 it was 872. The valuation in 1870 was $180,726. In 1880 it was $196,253. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 3 per cent. North Yarmouth is situated a little east of the centre of Cumberland County, 14 miles N.N.E. of Portland. On the east is Pownal ; Yarmouth and Cumberland bound it on the south, the latter and Gray on the west and north-west, New Gloucester and Pownal] on the north. The form of the town is nearly square. The surface is 26"], [410, "GjAZETTEER OF MAINE. 402 without much unevenness. Walnut Hill, in the western part of the town, is the greatest elevation, and Little Walnut, about a mile to the east, is the next in height. The village called Walnut Hill begins between them, extending southward. Royals River runs through the town nearly north and south. On the eastern side of the river the Grand Trunk Railway and on the west the Maine Central Railway cross the town in the same general direction. The latter has a station at Walnut Hill, where is the largest collection of houses in town ; and the Grand Trunk has a station at EastrNorth Yarmouth, whence stages run daily to Pownall and Durham. The principal manufactures of the town are lumber, carriages, flour and meal. The land is of good quality, and agriculture is the almost exclusive business of the people. The region of Royal's River was called Wescustego by the Indians, this being also their name for the river itself. The territory of the present town was included in a grant made to Joseph Phippon and others in 1680, which extended from the sea five miles up the river, and seven and a half miles on each side. In the same year, the waste land between this grant and Falmouth, and also Damariscove Island, were included in the act of incorporation -under the name of North Yarmouth. A large part of Harpswell Neck -with Mare Point and intervening land was held to be within the cor- limits many years. Four towns have since been taken -from this territory, viz. : Freeport in 1789, Pownal in 1S08, Cumber land in 1821, and Yarmouth in 1849. John Mare, mentioned as an early settler of North Yarmouth, located on the point which has since borne his name, now included in Brunswick. William Royal came over from England about 1630, and in 1643 purchased of Gorges a -tract on the Wescustego River, subsequently called Royal's River. The -history of Yarmouth includes that of North Yarmouth until the separation in 1849. 'The town has a Congregationalist and a Methodist church. There are seven public schoolhouses in the town, valued at $3,300. The \u25a0valuation of estates for 1870 was $523,086 ; in 1880, $372,510. The population in 1870 was 940. In the census of 1880 it was 828. Norway is one of the south-eastern towns of Oxford County. Paris bounds it on the north-east, Oxford on the south-east, Waterford on the south-west, Albany and Greenwood on the north-west. The area is by estimate, about 25,000 acres. The town has numerous but not high \"hills. The most notable of these are Holt Hill, a little north west of the centre of the town, Frost Hill, at the south-west, and Pike Hill at the south-east. The number of ponds is also large. Great Pennesseewassee Pond extends its length of 4\u00a3 miles just east of the middle of the town, finding outlet to the Little Androscoggin River, at Norway Village, in the north-west corner of the town. Tributary to this is North Pond, in the north-east, and Little Pennesseewassee, on the west. Somewhat south-west of the centre of the town is Sand Pond, with its tributaries, Mud and Round, sending its own outlet into Thompson Pond, at the south-east. At the extreme north is Furlong Pond. Crooked River forms a part of the western boundary, and Bird Brook skirts the town on the east. The soil is fertile and the farmers thrifty. There are eleven water-powers in the town, of which Pennes seewassee Falls, at Norway Village, constitute six. Five of these"], [411, "NUMBER TWO PLANTATION. 403 powers bear the name of Steep Falls, having an aggregate fall of 56 feet in 15 rods. There are here two grain mills, a tannery, and fur niture, patent board box, shovel-handle, boot and shoe, clothing and carriage factories, a stave and shook-mill, a planing-mill, a machine shop, a cloth and cardingmill, harness and trunk-makers, etc. On streams, in other quarters of the town, are three saw-mills. Noble Corners, at the northern part of the town, shows quite a cluster of houses. The nearest railroad station for most of the town is at South Paris, scarcely a mile from Norway Village. The stage-line from South Paris to Bridgton and Fryeburg runs through this town. The scenery of Norway, varied with so many hills and ponds and intersected by good roads is very agreeable to look upon, and easy of passage. The village has several handsome residences, and its streets are ornamented with shade trees. On the outskirts of the village, on the south are the fair grounds. Norway is composed of a tract of about 6,000 acres, purchased of Massachusetts in 1787, and another of the same size granted to Mr. Lee, and known as the Lee Grant, two other tracts known as Cum niing's Gore and Kent Gore, and three tiers of lots taken from the plantation of Waterford. The settlement came about in this wise : James Stinchfield, Jonas Stevens and some others, came to hunt about the ponds, and finding such beautiful growths of wood and other in dications of a good soil, determined to settle here. Accordingly, in 1786, Stevens, his brother Joseph, Jeremiah and Amos Hobbs, and George Lessley, came in, made clearings and built houses, and in due time brought in their families. A Captain Rust had become a large proprietor of land here, and performed many generous acts toward the settlers, for which he was much beloved and esteemed, so that the plantation adopted his name until its incorporation. This occurred March 9, 1797; and the present name was then adopted with the pur pose to honor the nation which dwelt in Norway, in Europe. Many of the early settlers were soldiers in the Revolution, one of whom, Phineas Whitney, served throughout the war, and was at the battle of Bunker Hill, being one of the last to leave the field. In 1843 the entire records of the town were destroyed by fire. The Norway Savings Bank in Norway Village, at the beginning of the fiscal year of 1880, held in deposits and accrued profits the sum of $149,088.28. Norway National Bank has a capital of $100,000. The newspaper entitled \" The New Religion \" is the only one now published in the town. It is a spirited and able paper. As its name indicates, it is a paper with a theological purpose, and the views it advocates are those held by the Universalist denomination. The first church was formed in this town about 1802 ; and the Rev. Noah Cressey was ordained Sept. 20, 1809. There are now a Univer salist and a Free Baptist church, two belonging to the Methodists and two to the Congregationalists. There is a circulating library' of nearly 700 volumes at the village. The Norway Liberal Institute is a flourish ing school of a high grade. The number of public schoolhouses is seventeen, having, with appurtenances, a value of $6,000. The popu lati n in 1870 was 1,954. In 1880 it was 2,519. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $641,644. In 1880 it was $889,863. Number TWO Plantation (Grand Falls) lies on the"], [412, "GjiZETTEER OF MAINE. 404 south-eastern border of Penobscot County, about 50 miles north-east of Bangor. Burlington bounds it on the north, an angle of Greenfield touches it on the south-west, and Washington County bounds it on the east and south. Munsungun or Passadumkeag Mountain stands north-west of the centre of the township. Saponac Lake lies in the northern part, receiving the waters of the Passadumkeag, on the east, and discharging them at the west. Madagascal Stream discharges into the Passadumkeag River, in this township. A branch of Union River rises in the central part. The nearest post-office is Burlington. The nearest railroad station is that of the European and North American Railway at Olamon, in the town of Greenbush, on the Penobscot. There is one public schoolhouse, valued at $100. The valuation of estates in 1880 was $23,822. The population in 1870 was 100. In 1880 it was 93. Number Eighteen Plantation is in the East Division of Washington County, and joins East Machias on the north. In the eastern part of the township is Rocky Lake, having a length of about 3i- miles by 3'14 of a mile in width. Near the centre of the township is the lesser First Lake, on the eastern line is Round Lake, at the north-eastern angle is Munson Lake, at the north-western is Long Lake, at the western line is Little Bog Lake, and Hadley Lake extends for about one mile of its length into the township from the south. Salko Hill is the highest eminence. The soil is a light sandy loam. The crops chiefly depended upon are potatoes and hay. Farm ing and lumbering are the principal occupations. This plantation was organized in 1848. The oldest inhabitant was ninety-four years of age in 1880. There is one public schoolhouse, valued at $100. The population in 1870 was 42. In 1880 it was 40. Number Eleven, Range 1 Plantation is on the New Brunswick border ; and is bounded north by Hodgdon, south by Amity, and west by Linneus, and Letter A. of Range 2. The plantation includes but half a township. The streams are the Me duxnekeag on the northern side, Davis Stream at the middle of the town, and Shehan and Alder brooks in the eastern part.

Old Orchard Beach lies between Wood Island Light at the mouth of the Saco River and Prout's Neck in Scarborough. This berch has been called the finest in New England. Its actual limits are from near the mouth of the Saco to Pine Point near the mouth of Scarborough River, having the form of the arc of a circle. At low tide the beach is about 300 feet in width, of fine, hard, smooth sand, at no point wholly interrupted by rocks for the whole distance of 9 miles, and affording an excellent drive-way ; while from the absence of undertow, the surf-bathing is perfectly safe. It is reached by stage from Saco, and by the cars of the Eastern and the Boston and Maine railroads. A branch of the Eastern road has now been extended southward along the beach for 3 miles to Bay View at the mouth of the Saco, where connection is made with the Pool in Biddeford by means of a ferry-boat, and with Saco and Biddeford at the falls by steamers. The two latter afford a convenient means of viewing the river scenery, the buildings and the beach. Near the hotels and a little back from the shore, is a beautiful forest park of -30 acres, with pleasant paths, arbors and rustic adornments. About 2 miles towards Saco on Foxwell's Brook is a picturesque waterfall about 40 feet in perpendicular height. Half a mile south of the large hotels is the pic turesque camp-meeting ground of the Methodists. It is situated in a hollow among hillocks, and beneath the shade of noble trees growing in a thick grove. JBetween the camp-ground and the beach, scattered over rocky knolls, is a village of summer cottages owned by the breth ren who annually sojourn in the place through the weeks of religious and temperance meetings. At the beach and its neighborhood are a large number of public houses, from the country tavern to the palatial hotel of 500 rooms, furnished in the best manner, and supplied with all the latest appliances for comfort and entertainment. This beach received its name from an orchard set by Thomas Rogers who settled here in 1638. His farm, near Goose Fare Brook, became of so much importance that the early geographers of Maine designated it on their maps as \" Rogers' Garden.\" The trees that he planted re-"], [416, "408 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. mained more than a century. But long after the first hotels were built, and even to this day, there are standing some of the trees of an \"old orchard,\" but a subsequent one, planted by some later disciple of vomoculture. In the early days, the councillors constituting the government of Gorges' province of Maine met for business at the house of Richard Bonython, which stood on the east side of Saco River, near the lower ferry, or just above the terminus of the Old Orchard Beach Railroad. This form of government continued from 1639 to 1652, from which date Massachusetts most of the time maintained her authority- and government here by the strong hand. In 1677, however, the heirs of Gorges sold their right to the Commonwealth, which thenceforth held OLD ORCHARD BEACH. ME. undisputed jurisdiction, until separated from her and admitted as a State in 1820. No summer resort can be complete without a picturesque character in its his tory ; and this want is supplied to Old Orchard by its pioneer caterer, Ned Clem ens \u2014 half hermit, half epicure. The first knowledge of him in this region was his arrival at a hotel in Saco, where his genial deportment soon won him many friends. By his apt quutati >us, he exhibited a knowledge of the dramatic poets and classic LUthors ; and his acquaintance with American scenery showed that he bad ac quired much knowledge from travel. In music he was accomplished, and often be guiled his leisure with his flute. He was reticent in regard to his previous life, but in later years it became known that he was a native of Philadelphia, where he was educated for a dramatic life; and several years acted in that profession. He was with Barnum in the first organization of bis popular exhibition. Evidently he was not successful in this line; and having met with disaster in a matrimonial"], [417, "OLDTOWN. 409 project, he had wandered to Saco to start afresh in a new place. Looking about for a means of livelihood, he opened some bathing-rooms under the Thornton House. After awhile this house was burned down, and poor Ned had to make a new shift; and he next alighted with his bathing-tubs in the basement of Cataract Block. Then to his bathing he added victualling. By the death of an artist brother in a distant State, he became the possessor of a panorama of the River Rhine, with which he travelled for awhile. His tastes \u2014 and poverty \u2014 at length led him to Old Orchard Beach, where among the whispering pines which then stood near the site of the present Sea Shore House, he erected a small building which he furnished, o-aiamenting it with natural history specimens. This received the name of \" Old Orchard Retreat,\" where he dwelt alone, and entertained such patrons as came with chowders and other simple fare. He also supplied bathing-suits to his patrons. Here, too, he issued a small newspaper called the \" Goose Fare Guide and Old Orchard Bellows.\" It is acknowledged to be the first \" Guide \" to these shores, and the '\u25a0 Bellows \" which first blew abroad the praises of Old Orchard. But E. C. Staples, proprietor of the Old Orchard House, was the first to open a house for boarders, which he did in 1S37, at the solicitation of a few individuals who had been impressed with the beauty of the beach and the invigorating quality of the climate. He then dwelt in a plain farm-bouse, the home of his ancestors ; but it has been remodeled, and is now the Staples' Cottage. The first season's boarders were charmed with the place, and the next year there were more applica tions than the house could accommodate ; and he soon increased its capacity by an addition. Among the early patrons of Mr. Staples were gentlemen and their families from Montreal, who came the whole distance in their own private car riages. The Portsmouth and Portland Railroad was opened in 1842, and the Grand Trunk from Montreal to Portland in 1852. These biought passengers to Saco Station, within four miles of the beach ; and from that time the demand for hotel accommodations increased with great rapidity Mr. Staples enlarged his house from year to year until his \" Old Orchard House,\" accommodating 300 guests, had been erected. This was popular and prosperous, until destroyed by fire. July 21, 1875. The new \" Old Orchard House \" was erected in 1876, with ac commodations for 500 guests. Boarding-houses and hotels have since been increas ing and enlarging for several years, until now they number above 30, with accom modations for more than 4,000 guests. Adjuncts of Old Orchard Beach are Bay View or Ferry Beach, at the mouth of the Saco River, the Pool in Biddeford on the opposite shore,* Pine Point, and Prout's Neck.f All these places are supplied with hotels t \u2014 some of superior quality. OldtOWIl, in Penobscot County, lies on the west side of Penobscot River, 12 miles north of Bangor. The towns which bound it are Alton and Argyle on the north, Hudson and Glenburn on the west, Orono on the south and Milford on the east. The last is sepa rated from it by the river. The surface of the town is generally quite even ; but a hill of the kind known as a \" horse back,\" runs the entire length north and south. Besides the Penobscot, the water-courses are Pushaw and Birch streams. The first is the outlet of Pushaw Lake, which lies on a portion of the west line of the town. Another stream is the so-called Stillwater River, which is fed by Birch and Pushaw streams, and discharges into the Penobscot by three mouths, two of which are in Oldtown, and one in Orono. Between these and the Penobscot are several islands, of which the largest extends from the middle of the town into Orono pn the south. Upon the eastern side of this is situated Oldtown village, and on the west the little hamlet of \"Pushaw,\" and at the southern verge of the town Upper Stillwater village and post-office. The other principal islands are Orson and Orono islands, and Oldtown Island. The latter is the property and the principal residence of the remnant of the Penobscot tribe of Indians. * See article on.

Bailey Esq., State Agent for the Penobscot Indians, has courteously furnished the following state ment respecting them. \" The Penobscot Tribe of Indians is located on the islands in the Penobscot River between Oldtown and Lincoln, a distance of 35 miles. There are 146 islands in this river between Oldtown and Mattawamkeag, containing in all 44S2 acres, which are reserved for their tribe. Their present number is about 245. They live in frame houses and some have very comfortable and tasty houses. They maintain a tribal form of government, electing annually a governor and a lieutenant-governor, also a delegate to the State Legislature which they are allowed. Politically, they are divided into two parties ; the \"Old\" or conserva tive, and the \"New \" or progressive. Schools are maintained among them ; and on Oldtown Island they have a convenient house of worship. In religious faith, they are adherents of the Roman Catholic church, having a priest to care for their religious interests. A community of Sisters of Mercy is established among them, and these have a salutary influence upon their moral and domestic condition. The schools are also taught by them Agriculture receives some attention under the stimulus of State appropriations. The men are employed as rivermeii by those engaged in lumbering, also as guides to tourists in the Maine woods, and as boatmen on the lake and streams of North ern Maine. The women find constant employment at basket-making ; their wares being unique and ornamental in design and workmanship. They frequent the 9ummer resorts along the coast of New England during the \" open season\" for the purpose of vending their handiwork, aud find it quite profitable. The State annually distributes to the tribe about $10,000 under treaty stipula tions, and in specific appropriations for the advancement of their moral, intellect ual and industrial interests.\" 4 For further details respecting these see the article on Indians in the first part of this volume. The European and North American Railway connects Oldtown with Bangor. The Bangor and Piscataquis Railroad forms a junction with the former at the village. The village also occupies the larger part of an island in the Penobscot. An excellent bridge across the river at this point connects with Bradley. The Penobscot River here affords what has been called the finest water-power in the United States. In the broad upper outlet of the Stillwater River is the Main Boom of the \" Penobscot Boom AssQciation,\" for the storage of logs. The number of logs held in this boom are usually numbered by millions. It is currently stated that it originally cost about $100,000. The object is to stop all the lumber coming down the river, letting it out in small quantities that can be controlled, lest great bodies of it should escape to sea in freshets, and be lost. During the rafting season there are often three hundred men employed upon the logs which come into this boom, assorting them according to ownership, and forming them into rafts, to be floated to the various mills upon the river below. In 1855 there were rafted here 181,000,000 feet. At one time it was estimated that there were six hundred acres of logs in the boom. The lower power in this town is the Great Works Falls, of which the natural fall is formed by two ridges of ledge extending across the river about 80 rods apart with a fall of about 3^- feet each. The river at this point is about 700 feet in width. The Oldtown Falls are at Oldtown village, and consist of a wing dam at the upper part of the village, and a dam on the west stream of the Penobscot which sepa rates the island part from the main village. Other powers are at Upper Stillwater, Cooper's Falls, three miles above the last, Pushaw Falls, on the Pushaw- Stream in the north-western part of the town"], [420, "412 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. near Alton. On these different powers are four large mills for long lumber, three for shingles and short lumber, and a grist-mill. The size of these mills will be apprehended better by an enumeration of saws. In 1870 two blocks of mills here formerly owned by Samuel Veazie, contained 14 single saws, 5 gang, 3 shingle, 2 clapboard and 4 lath mills. These usually- run about seven months in the year, manu facturing in that time, 25,000,000 feet of long lumber, 4,500,000 shin gles, 1,000,000 clapboards, 13,500,000 laths, pickets, etc. There are also three steam saw-mills. The smaller manufactures consist of two barrel factories, a batteaux, a brush-wood, a sample case, a saw-filing machine, and an oar factory, together with the handicraft work usually found in our villages. Oldtown village has some handsome residences, and several streets laid out in good style, and beautified with shade and ornamental trees. There is an excellent town hall, with a seating capacity for 1,500 per sons. Other villages in the town merit the same description according to their extent. The roads and bridges are generally in excellent con dition. The post-offices are Upper Stillwater, West Great Works and Pea Cove. As might be supposed, the principal occupations relate to lumber. The inhabitants are now a homogeneous people, but their parentage embraces a great number of nationalities. Hons. Samuel Coney and Geo. P. Sewall, are probably the most distinguished citizens. The central portion of the town has an excellent system of graded schools, from primary to high. The number of public schoolhouses in the town at the present time is nine, valued at $10,000. The churches here art Baptist, Congregational, Methodist, Episcopal, Universalist and Catholic. This town was formerly- a part of Orono, but was set off and incor porated March 16th, 1840. The population in 1870 was 4,529. In 1880 it was 3,070. The valuation in 1870 was $684,308. In 1880 it was $528,109.

Amity bounds it on the north, Haynesville on the west, Weston and Grand Lake on the south. Mon ument Stream and North Lake separate it from the soil of New Bruns wick. In the western part is Scaggrock Stream, a tributary of the Mattawamkeag. The surface is rocky and uneven, but the soil is strong and productive. Wheat, oats, buckwheat, potatoes and hay are the crops chiefly cultivated, and much attention is given to raising farm stock. The forests are of hemlock, spruce, maple and beech. Peter's Hill, the highest elevation, is a long plateau extending south ward from the middle of the northern line. This town is 25 miles south of Hamilton on the stage-line to Danforth Station on the Euro pean and North American railway. Orient was incorporated April 9, 1856. The town sent eleven men"], [421, "ORLAND. 413 into the army of the Union during the war of the rebellion, and lost five. There are many old people in the town, indicating a salubrious climate that offsets the hardships of a border settlement. The Baptists are the most active religious society here. There are three public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $500. The popu lation in 1870 was 219. In 1880 it was 166. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $35,000. In 1880 it was $42,554. Orland is situated upon the Penobscot, being the most north- erly town in Hancock County upon that river, except one. It is at the head of Eastern River, 15 miles west of Ellsworth. At the north- western part of the town are Toddy and Great Ponds, whose outlet furnishes the principal water-power of that town. \"The surface con- formation of Orland is peculiar. The hills are conical and precipitous, while the valleys approach the gorge form. Standing upon a pictu- resque knoll of ' modified drift,' on the farm of Frank Buck, one has a grand view of the erratic results of one of nature's tantrums.

It has several looms with walls and ceiling of basaltic finish.\" [Samuel Wasson, in \" Survey of Hancock County.\"] These mountains are supposed to belong to the Mountain Limestone period, that age of the growing continent when the cimoid \" beads of St. Cuthbert \" were formed. The highest of these elevations are Great Pond Mountain and Mason's Mountain, 575 and 350 feet in height, respectively. The ponds are Alamoosic, Toddy, Heart and Craig's, the first being three and one- half by two and one-half miles, and the second nine by one and one- half miles, in extent. The soil is a clay loam ; and the crops most cul- tivated are hay, grain and potatoes. There is, in general, a tidiness about the farms that would indicate thrift; and many are supplied with mowing and other labor-saving machines. At Orland village are a lumber and grist-mill, a brick-yard, and a ship-yard. At East Or- land there is a flour-mill and a saw-mill. There are also saw-mills in other parts of the town. The woollen factory in Orland, when in full operation, turned out in one season 30,000 yards of repellants, at a cost of six cents a yard less than any similar establishment in the State. Orland is on the Bangor and Castine, and the Bluthill and Sedgewick stage-lines. The nearest railroad station is at Bucksport, three miles distant. The township is said to have been the Number 2 of the grant to David Marsh. Other authorities say that it was granted to W. Dall, Nathaniel Snellings, Robert Treat, and others of Boston ; but it ap pears quite likely that this was only a grant of a portion at a later date, there having been a large accession of settlers between 1767 and 1780.

Its name is supposed to have been de rived from \" Oarland,\" an oar having been found upon its shores by Joseph Gross, the first settler, who came in 1764. Ebenezer Gross came in 1765, and Joseph Viles in 1766. The latter built the first framed house, \u2014 which was used for the plantation meetings until 1804, when the first schoolhouse was built. Zachariah Gross, the first child, was born in 1766. The first road was laid out in 1771, by John Han cock and Samuel Craig. The first saw and grist-mills were built at the lower falls by Calvin Turner, in 1773. Large accessions of inhab itants were made between 1767 and 1780, from Boston. The popula tion in 1790 was 290. The first county road through the plantation was laid out in 1793. There are fifteen persons residing in the town who are above eighty years of age. Orland furnished 195 men for the Union cause during the war of the Rebellion, paying bounty to the amount of $14,855. The Methodists, Congregationalists and Universalists each have a church in town, Orland has fifteen public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $6,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $374,390. In 1880 it was $358,325. The population in 1870 was 1,701. In 1880 it was 1,689. OmeVllle is the south-easterly town of Piscataquis County, and contains 23,040 acres. The township was purchased from the State by General J. P. Boyd, soon after his return from India, and was known as Boyd's Plantation. Abner and Allen Hoxie, James Philpot, William M. and Eben Ewer, William and Solon Hamlin, were the first settlers. In 1832 the township was incorporated as the town of Mil ton. The town affairs were badly managed, and the corporation and many of the inhabitants thereby became impoverished. After the death of the proprietor, General Boyd, Hon. Henry Orne, of Boston, one of the heirs, lent his aid to place matters on a better basis. He built a saw-mill and grist-mill at the outlet of Boyd's Lake, and a noble residence for himself nearby. Elder Spencer Howe, who opened a store near the mills, also contributed to the prosperity of the town. Another minister, Elder Gershom Lord, pursued a successful business career in town. In 1841, the name of the town was changed to Almond, and the next year to Orneville, in honor of its leading citizen. The manufac tories are situated on Dead Stream, and its branches. They consist of two lumber-mills, a shingle-mill, and two grist-mills. The Bangor and Piscataquis Railway passes near. Granite is the prevailing rock. The chief crops are hay and potatoes. Orneville is without any effective religious organization. All its public reserves go toward the support of the schools. It has six pub lic schoolhouses, valued at $1,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $80,062. In 1880, $73,730. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 047 on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 575. In 1880 it was 501.

The European and North American Railway passes through the town, connecting above with the Piscataquis branch. The powers are on the Penobscot and a tributary on the western \"chute\" of it, called Stillwater River. This stream receives the two streams of Birch and Pushaw Streams, the last being the outlet of Pushaw Lake on the north-western border. The area of this and connected lakes is about 12 square miles. The surface is generally quite even. The land along the Penobscot is very productive, bin the quality deteriorates as it recedes from the river. A large proportion of the people are en gaged in agriculture. The village is at the mouth of the Stillwater River. There are two considerable falls on this river in the town, and successive falls amounting to 31 feet on the western channel of the Penobscot between Ayer's Island and the village, known as \" Ayer's RESIDENCES OF COL.

Falls.\" The mills upon the privilege are known as the \" Basin Mills.\" On this power are mills containing eight single saws, four gangs, two lath, two clapboard, one shingle, two rotary saws and a machine-shop. On the powers on Stillwater River were (according to Well's Water- Power of Maine), twenty-two single saws, ten gangs, and five rotary saws; and twelve lath, three shingle and four clapboard mills, and two planing-machines, one machine-shop and one grist-mill. There are also a grist-mill and a match-factory. There is still a vast amount of unused water-power in the town. The Orono National Bank has a capital of $50,000. The Orono Savings Bank, at the opening of the last fiscal year held in deposits and profits $33,455.16. The village"], [425, "ORRINGTON. 417 has something of the clutter usual to lumber towns, yet the houses are generally neat and attractive, and even elegant in some cases ; while the streets are beautified by large numbers of elms and maples. Orono was settled in 1774 by Jeremiah Colburn and Joshua Avers, the State of Massachusetts being then owner of the township. John Marsh soon after settled on an island near the site of the piiesent vil lage, from whom it bore the name of Marsh Island. The first white woman in the place was Miss Betsey Colburn, who came in 1774. The McPheters, Whites and Spencers were also early settlers. About 1808 came John Bennoch, a native of Scotland, and Andrew Webster, father of the late Col. E. Webster. These were the most active, enter prising lumber-men on the river, and had a large share in founding the present prosperity of the town. The plantation name was Stillwater. The present name is that of a distinguished chief of the Tarratine or Penobscot Indians, who dwelt here at the period of the Revolution, rendering much service to the patriots. It was incorporated March 12, 1806, and then included the territory which now constitutes Old town. The latter was set off in 1840. The soil of this town consists of clay and sandy loams, and is very productive. Hon. Israel Washburn, formerly a member of the national congress and governor of Maine, was subsequently a citizen of Orono. The Congregationalists, Methodists, Universalists and Catholics each have a church in the town The number of public schoolhouses is eleven, and the Value of the school property is $12,100. The village schools are graded, and include a good high school. The State College of Agricul ture and Mechanic Arts is located about one mile from the village on the east bank of the Stillwater River in a beautiful and commanding situa tion. The design of this institution is to give the young men of the State the advantages of a liberal education, by affording the student opportunity of applying practically the principles he learns in the class room, and by his labor in this application to defray a portion of his e.x> penses. The educational qualifications required for admission are such as might be obtained in any district school. The college has five courses, viz.: \u2014 in Agriculture, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineer ing, Chemistry, and in Science and Literature. Full courses in any of these entities a graduate to the Bachelor's Degree in that department. Three years after graduation, on presentation of the usual testimonials of proficiency, a full Degree is conferred. The number of students in 1880 was upwards of 100. It is a valuable institution to the people of Maine and deserves well at their hands.* The valuation of Orono in 1870 was $523,888. In 1880 it was $512,624. The rate of taxation is 22 mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 2,888. In 1880 it was 2,245. Ornng'ton is the most southern town in Penobscot County, It is situated upon the eastern bank of the Penobscot, about six miles below Bangor, on the Bucksport and Bangor railroad. Orrington is bounded on the north by Brewer, east by Holden, and east and south by Bucksport, in Hancock County. The surface is rather hilly and1 rocky in many parts, but has a fair quality of soil which yields well! under thorough cultivation. There are many good farms in this town, [* See also article on Education, in the first part of this volume], 27"], [426, "418 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. and many very attractive residences. A drive along some of its roads is delightful. Orrington Great Pond, formerly Brewer Pond, lies or. the eastern line of the town, and with a smaller connected pond on the north, gives a water surface of about 10 square miles. It discharges through Segeunkedunk Stream into the Penobscot in Brewer, just over the north line of Orrington. This stream furnishes at East Orrington power for a saw-mill, and a short distance below for a shingle-mill and tannery; then by successive falls, for two grist-mills and another saw mill. In the southern part of the town lies Sweet's Pond, smallest of the three, sending its overflow into the Penobscot at the village of South Orrington. At this place are two lumber-mills and a grist-mill. Other manufactures in the town are drain-tile, earthen-ware, churns, boots and shoes, etc. The first settlement in Orrington was made by Capt. John Brewer, from Worcester, Mass., in June, 1770, at the mouth of the Segeunke dunk Stream, where he built a mill. He had obtained consent of the General Court to settle here upon condition that he should receive a grant of the territory from the crown within three years ; and with his associates, he caused the exterior lines of a tract large enough for a township to be surveyed. They had sent to the king a petition, and a grant was promised ; but just then news of the battle of Lexing ton was received, and the patent was not issued. During the war, -Brewer and other settlers were annoyed by the British from the river below to such an extent that they left the place, returning when the war closed. In 1784, the township was surveyed by R. Dodge, and on March 25th, 1786, Captain Brewer, with Simeon Fowler (who had settled three miles below in what is now Orriflgton) purchased from Massachusetts for \u00a33,000 in joint notes, the lots abutting on the river, t'b the extent of 10,864 acres. The residue of the township was granted to Moses Knapp and his associates. Many of the first settlers were mariners, who had been forced by the approach of war to seek other business ; but navigation reviving on the return of peace, many of these returned to their old pursuits, taking with them their grown up sons. Previous to its incorporation as a town on March 21, 1788, the settlement had borne the name of New Worcester, or Plantation No. 9. The town was named for Orangetown, Md., but, by a mis spelling in the act of incorporation, the name became Orrington. The first representative to the legislature was Oliver Leonard, in 1798. The centres of business are Orrington, on the river near the middle of the town ; East and South Orrington, the last being the largest. At Goodale Corners, in the south-eastern part of the town, is an excellent nursery ; and the town abounds in fine orchards. There were first erected in Orrington two meeting-houses seven miles apart, and equally distant from each end of the town. There is now a Methodist church at Orrington village, at South Orrington and at the Centre, and a Congregational church at East Orrington. The town has some ex cellent schoolhouses, the entire number being thirteen. They are valaed at $4,975. The population in 1870 was 1768. In 1880 it was 1,529. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $400,839. In 1880 it was $405,898. Ol*r'S Island, \u2014 a post-office on an island of the same name in Harpswell, Cumberland County."], [427, "OTISFIELD. 419 OSSipee MillS,\u2014 a post-office in York County. Otis is situated on the western side of Hancock County, being bounded on the north by Penobscot County, and on the South by Ells worth. It is on the stage line from Bangor to Mariaville, which adjoins it on the east. The principal sheets of water are Beech Hill, Flood, Springy and Mountain ponds, emptying into Union River, or some of its branches. Of these, Flood's Pond covers one square mile ; Beech Hill Pond, 1.85 square miles; and Mountain Pond, 1.25 square miles At Remick's Falls, at the foot of Flood's Pond, and also at the south part of the town, are saw-mills. The prevailing rock is mica-schist mterstratified by an impure limestone. On the side next Mariaville the rock is a hard talcose slate and a kind of sandstone in alternate layers, placed perpendicularly. There is a cave in Oak Hill on the west side of Beech Hill Pond, which is 12 ieet under ground, with rooms 7 feet by 10 feet. Ice and snow have been found in it on the 4th of July, by which it has gotten its name of the \" Cold Cellar.\" The soil, as a whole, is productive when cultivated ; but much attention is given to lumbering. Otis was first occupied in 1805. It was incorporated in 1835, being named in honor of a proprietor. The first settlers were Isaac Frazier, N. M. Jellison, James Gilpatrick, and Allen Milliken. Otis furnished 35 men to the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion. The Free Baptists have a church, and a settled minister in the town. Otis has three public schoolhouses, valued at $400. The valu ation of estates in 1870 was $26,407. In 1880 it was $34,725. The population in 1870 was 246. In 1880 it was 304. Otisfield is the most easterly of the northern towns of Cum berland County. Thompson's Pond separates it from Poland in An droscoggin County and from the southern part of the iownof Oxford in Oxford County. Norway in the same county bounds it on the north, on the west is Harrison in Cumberland County ; and Naples and Casco bound it on the south. Crooked River forms the boundary line for the entire length of the town on the western side. The ponds are Little, Moose, Saturday and Pleasant, beginning at the north of the town and increasing in size southward, the last containing two and a quarter 6quare miles of surface. Thompson's Pond, which washes the eastern side of the town, has an area of eight square miles. The surface ot the town is uneven, the highest eminences being Scribner Hill and Meet ing House Hill. The soil is gravelly, but strong and productive ; and there are many fine farms in town. Com, potatoes and hay are the principal crops. At Bolster's Mills, Centre and East Otisfield are small saw-mills, and at Spurr's Corner is a large clothing manufactory. Otisfield lies 36 miles N.N.W. of Portland, being on the stage-line from that city to Bolster's Mills. It is also on the stage-line from the Oxford Station of the Grand Trunk Railway to Naples. The town ship was granted to Hon. James Otis, Nathaniel Gorham, and the .-est of the heirs and assigns of Captain John Gorham, for services against Canada in 1770. The first plantation meeting was held in the house of Stephen Phinney, in 1787. David Ray was moderator, Joseph Wight, jr., clerk, David Ray, Benjamin Patch, and Noah Reed, as-"], [428, "420 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. sessors, and Jonathan Moors, collector. The inhabitants first voted for a representative to Congress in 1794. In 1797 the town was in corporated under its plantation name of Otisfield. At the first town meeting it was voted to settle Thomas Roby as first minister. As incorporated, it included all of Otisfield, nearly all of Harrison, and a large part of Naples. The first saw-mill was erected by David Ray. William G. Cobb was the first male child born in the town, the date of birth being Oct. 14, 1779. The Congregationalists, Methodists, and Free Baptists each have a church in the town, and there is also a Union meeting-house. Otisfield has twelve public schoolhouses, valued at $2,300. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $298,582. In 1880 it was $262,027. The pop ulation in 1790 was 197; in 1870 it was 1,099. The census of 1880 shows it to have decreased to 927. Owl'S Head, a promontory bearing a light-house on the west shore of Penobscot Bay in South Thomaston, a short distance be low Rockland. Also a small harbor and village just south of the promontory. OxbOW Plantation, Aroostook County, rests on the north-eastern corner of Penobscot County, the eastern line of the town ship and of the latter county nearly corresponding. The plantation is 45 miles north-west of Houlton, and 130 miles from Bangor. The first settlement was in 1840, and it was organized as No. 9, Range 6 Planta tion in 1848. It was organized as Oxbow Plantation in 1870. The name is doubtless from a peculiar curve of the Aroostook River in passing through the township. This river, in its course through the plantation, receives Umquolcus Stream from the south, Otter Brook from the north, Trout Brook from the east, and Hayden Brook from the north-west. There is one public schoolhouse, valued at $50. Some 8 or 10 lots of land are reserved for schools and other public purposes. The population in 1870 was 115. In 1880 it was 127. The valuation in 1880 was $18,917. Masardis, which has an angular contact with Oxbow at the north-east of the latter, is the nearest post-office. Oxford is the south-eastern town of the eastern expanse of Ox ford County. Paris joins it on the north, Hebron on the north-east, Norway on the north-west, Poland, in Androscoggin County, on the south-east, and Otisfield, in Cumberland County, on the south-west. The town is quite hilly, but the eminences are not of great height. Horse Hill, in the north-western part, is the only one that bears a name on the town map. Pigeon Hill, in the south-eastern part, refers to a locality rather than an eminence. The Little Androscoggin River runs through the town from the north-west to south-east. On the way it receives the waters of Thompson, Whitney and Hogan ponds, all lying in the southern part of the town. The first is 8 miles in length by 1| in width, and the others are each near 2 miles in length and -\u00a3 in width. Matthews Pond, with its outlet and its principal feeder form the divid ing line between this town and Hebron. The Grand Trunk Railway passes through the midst of the town, in the same general line with the river, and has a station (Oxford Depot) a short distance south of the centre. The other centres of business are Welchville and Oxford Vil-"], [429, "OXFORD COUNTY. 421 lage, both of which have post-offices. At the latter, situated at the outlet of Thompson Pond, are a stave-mill, a flour-mill and the woolen mills of the Robinson Manufacturing Co., (having three buildings and nine sets of machinery, and employing 150 operatives) and a shovel handle factory, employing 10 men. At Welchville, on the Little An droscoggin, are the woolen-mill of the Harper Manufacturing Co., having four sets of machinery, and employing 50 persons ; and the mill of the Mousam Manufacturing Co., making leather board, and em ploying 15 men. Granite shows itself frequently about the elevated ground. The soil varies from light to heavy in the proportion of about one to two, and is generally productive, though there is considerable plains land which has not been found of much value. Birch, maple, beech and oak constitute the forests. Hay is the largest crop, and a due number of cattle are raised. Both the villages and rural districts have the indications of thriftiness, and afford many pleasant scenes to the eye of the traveller. ' Oxford originally formed a part of Hebron from which it was in corporated in 1829. The first settlements were made during the clos ing years of the Revolution, by Captain Isaac Bolster, from Worces ter; John Caldwell, from Ipswich; Job and Joseph Cushman and Peter Thayer, from Plymouth ; Daniel Whitney, Daniel Bullen, Zadoc and Abraham Dean, Elliot Richmond, Daniel and Asa Bartlett, Nathaniel Fuller, Holmes Thomas, Zebulon Chadbourne, James Soule and James Perry, all from Massachusetts. A valued citizen of the early period was William C. Whitney, who settled here in 1796 and remained until 1840, doing faithful service in several important town affairs. Hon. J. S. Keith, a later citizen, served acceptably in the State Senate, and Hon. John J. Perry, member of Congress for two terms, was long a resident of Oxford. Mr. Perry has recently removed to Portland. This town sent 65 men to aid in the preservation of the Union, of whom 12 were lost. There are 59 persons in town over seventy years of age. In the Freeland Holmes library of 1,200 volumes, the town has an intellectual treasure of which the people do not fail to avail themselves. Oxford has eleven public schoolhouses, one of which is among the best in the county. The value of the school property is $6,000. The Con gregationalists have an excellent church, and the Methodists have two. There are also two Advent societies in the town. The population in 1870 was 1,631. In 1880 it was 1,655. The valuation in 1870 was $514,049. In 1880 it was $483,246. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 4 8-10 cents on the dollar. Oxford COimty occupies about two-thirds of our New England border, having a length of about 100 miles. Lying in near neighborhood with the White Hills of New Hampshire, Oxford County is emphatically the hill-region of Maine. Though it does not contain the highest eminences in the State, it presents more lofty peaks than any other equal extent of territory in New England. Among the most noted we should mention Mount Pleasant in Denmark, about 2,000 feet in height, and peculiar in its isolation, Speckled Mountain in Trafton and Streaked Mountain in Buckfield, striking in their appearance ; and Mount Mica in Paris, noted for the variety and beauty of its minerals. Granite, largely in the form of gneiss, underlies most of the county."], [430, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 422 Silver, gold, lead, zinc, arsenic, plumbago and iron are found in various places, also many varieties of valuable minerals. Tokens of former extensive action of water is shown everywhere in the excavation of valleys and the deposit of drift, while the bed rock, when uncovered, often exhibits glacial or drift markings. The soil in general is a gravelly loam, resting usually upon a solid bed of coarse gravel called \" pan.\" It is generally productive. Along the streams are many broad tracts of interval, with a soil of mingled vegetable and mineral matter, formed by the overflow waters in spring and autumn. The great pine trees, which were formerly numerous in all parts of the county, have been largely cut off, but there still remain, especially in northern and western parts, heavy growths of spruce, hemlock, rock-maple, beech and birch. The scenery of Oxford County is unsurpassed of its kind. Lofty and snowclad peaks, with almost impassable glens between, have their peculiar and thrilling attraction ; but the peaceful verdure of great woods, grassy valleys, rich meadows,- hillsides enlivened with flocks and herds, shining streams, and sky-repeating ponds, with occa sional breeze-swept eminences, affording wide views of the surrounding beauties, hold the regard of the lover of nature for a longer time, and are more restorative in their influences. Oxford County contains the larger portion of the lakes which form the source of the Androscoggin River, which also runs for nearly one third of its length through the midst of the county. In the central portion of the county lie the ponds from which the Little Androscoggin takes its rise. By numerous turnings and windings, the beautiful Saco River confers on this county, in its southern portion, about one half its length. The Androscoggin Lakes, lying in unsettled territory in this and adjacent divisions, can best be noticed in this connection. The aggre gate area of these lakes is nearly 80 square miles. They lie on the western part of the great elevated plateau of Maine. Their altitude above the sea is as follows : \u2014 Rangely, 1,511 feet; Mooselucmaguutic, 1,486 ; Richardson, 1,456 ; Umbagog, 1,256. Jataska, at the extreme head-waters of the Mississippi River, has an elevation of only 64 feet more than Rangely, 75 miles from the sea. Rangely Lake, the first large body of water in this series, lies wholly in Franklin County, and has been partially described in the article on the town of Rangely. We may mention here, however, that this lake is some 10 miles from. one extreme to the other, and about If miles in extreme width, with an area of 14 square miles. Rangely has its name from an English gentleman who for several years resided with his family in the seclu sion of its northern shore. The Indian name was Oquossoc, perpet uated in the name of an angling association, by one of their camps, a hotel, and a steamer that plies upon these lakes. Cupsuptic Lake, at the north-west of Rangely, and separated from it only by Bald Mountain and a narrow isthmus at its base, has an area of 3 square miles. On this lake where it receives the waters of Rangely Lake, is \" Indian Rock.\" Cupsuptic River, the principal feeder of this lake, has its source in Canadian soil. Great Lake or Mooselucmaguntic, lying south of the last, and south-west of Rangely, is the largest of this chain of lakes. It is about 9 miles in length, and about 3i in the broadest part and li in the narrowest. Its area is 21 square miles. On its outlet, the Richardson Lake Dam Company have their \" Upper Dam,\" the"], [431, "OXFORD COUNTY. 423 \" Lower Dair \" being on the outlet of Lower Richardson Lake. This dam is situated about midway of the rapid stream between the lakes, and is a vast and ponderous rampart of wood and iron, whose purpose is to hold back the waters of the upper lakes, in order to control the supply for manufacturing purposes. The ownership of the water priv ilege of these lakes is in the Union Water Power Company, at Lewiston. Next, at the outlet of Great Lake, about 2 miles to the south-west, is Upper Richardson, or Molechunkemunk Lake, having a length of some 5 miles and a breadth varying from 2 to 3 miles, with an area of 10 square miles. Still south-west of this and connected by a broad, quiet stream, is the lower Richardson, or Welokenabacook Lake. This is a little larger in each direction that Upper Richardson, and has an area of 11-15 square miles. On its outlet is the Middle Dam. It discharges into Umbagog Lake, on the line between Maine and New Hampshire, which is the last in this series of lakes. Its length is nearly 11 miles, its greatest width about 3J, and its least, \\\\ miles. Its area is 18 square miles. About a mile west of the lake its outlet receives the waters of Megalloway River, and here the stream of the Androscoggin is fully formed. About 3 miles below this junction is Errol Dam, the lowest landing-place of the lake steamers. The Megalloway has its rise in Parmachene Lake, some 25 miles north of Umbagog. An interesting locality on these lakes is \" Indian Rock,\" which has long been a well-known fishing-place and camp. A national post--office is now established here under the name. A short distance up the stream is Indian Eddy, and just below it on the op posite side, sparkling Kennebago River comes in. Almost in view from the outlet are Kennebago Falls ; and in the space between the mouth and Cupsuptic Lake, is located Camp Kennebago, with a hotel and all necessary appurtenances. This establishment is the property of the Oquossoc Angling Association. The course of the Kennebago is dotted with ponds, one of which is Kennebago Lake, some 15 miles from Rangely. This river has its rise a few miles east of the southern most point of the British Dominion on this side of Maine, in a group of seven ponds lying near each other.* At the extremity of the south ern area of Lower Richardson Lake is McAlister's Camp and the steamboat wharf for this part of the lake, \u2014 connecting with a carriage road to Andover Corner, distant about 15 miles. The Indians of Oxford County were all of the Abenaki nation. They were the Anasagunticooks and the Sokokis tribes. The first was a powerful tribe who occupied the entire valley of the Androscoggin to Merrymeeting Bay, and were quite fierce and warlike. The Sokokis are regarded as the most ancient tribe in Maine. The clan or branch, which dwelt in Oxford County was known under the name of Pequakets. Soon after the downfall of the French power in the north relieved the inhabitants of the northern border from the fear of Indian wars, attention turned more strongly to the lands of Maine. In 1762 a township of land on Saco River was granted to Gen. Joseph Frye, a native of Andover, Mass., and a distinguished soldier during the French and Indian wars. This was the first grant made within the limits of Oxford County, and received the name of Fryeburg. Its set tlement began the following year. Other grants followed, and settle- * For further in regard to this region see Rangely, and Greenvale aud Lincoln plantations."], [432, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE 424 ments were made in Waterford, Bethel, Rumford, Paris, Hebron, Buckfield, and others in succession. The territory now embraced by the county of Oxford was originally embraced in York, as, in fact, was also the whole of Maine. In 1760 Cumberland County was formed, embracing the whole of the present Oxford, with the exception of a few western towns. Oxford County was formed by an act approved March 4, 1805, from portion of York and Cumberland, Paris being fixed upou in the act as the shire town. The southern tier of towns in the county, were Turner, Hebron, Norway, Waterford, Lovell, Den mark, Hiram and Porter, and included all the territory north of these towns, between New Hampshire on the west and Kennebec County on the east, to Canada. In 1838 the county of Franklin received five towns and a large number of plantations from Oxford, constituting more than half its territory. In 1854 it relinquished two towns to form Androscoggin County. It now has 35 towns and 3 organized plantations. Its area is about 1700 square miles. The Grand Trunk Railway was extended through the county in 1850 ; previous to which time the people were accommodated by a stage-line to Portland, which made trips each way twice a week, and farmers carried their produce to Portland with their teams. The Rumford Falls and Buckfield Railroad connects with the Grand Trunk at Mechanic Falls, but at present has not been built beyond Canton Point. Below Mechanic Falls, the Lewiston and Auburn Railroad connects, forming a branch to Lewiston. Oxford County has three agricultural societies, all in a prosperous condition. They are the Oxford County society, its grounds lying between Norway and South Paris villages, West Oxford having its fair ground at Fryeburg, and East Oxford with fair grounds at Dix field. This county has 350 public schoolhouses ; and the school prop erty is valued at $117,000. The population in 1870 was 33,488. In 1880 it was 32,625. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $9,794,066. In 1880 it was $10,058,554. Palermo, the south-western town of Waldo County, has Montville and Liberty on the east, Freedom in Waldo, and Albion in Kennebec County on the north, China on the west, and Somerville in Lincoln, and Washington in Knox County on the south. This town is about 8\u00a3 miles long N.N.E. and S.S.W., and about 5\u00a3 miles in width. The surface is generally varied with hills and dales ; and hav ing good roads, is extremely pleasant for summer drives. Sheepscot Great Pond, 1-} square miles in area, lies in the southern part of the town. Branch Pond, on the north-western border, is the next in size ; and scattered over the town are numerous smaller ones. The soil is good, consisting mainly of a gravelly loam. The inhabitants are prin cipally devoted to agriculture. The largest village is Branch Mills (Palermo P. O.), but a portion of it is in the adjoining town of China. It is situated on the outlet of Branch Pond on the western line. There are at this place eight mills manufacturing boards, shingles, staves and headings. At North Palermo is a manufactory of drag-rakes ; at the Centre is a board and shingle-mill, and a stone quarry ; at East Palermo are two lumber-mills. This town is 25 miles w-est of Belfast, on the stage-route\" to Augusta, \u2014 the latter being about 18 miles distant. Vassalboro is the nearest railroad station."], [433, "PARIS. 425 Palermo was earliest known as Sheepscot Great Pond, from the body of water in the southern part of the town through which the Sheepscot River runs, and around which were the first settlements. The petition for incorporation was presented in 1801, and set forth among other things that they had -a great proportion of roads to make and maintain within their bounds, and 10 miles of road at least out of their limits, which road led to the head of navigation on Sheepscot River, their nearest market.' Among the 55 signers of this petition were Gabriel Hamilton, Jacob Greely-, Jabez Lewis, James Dennis, William C. Hay, Joseph Whittier, Charles Lewis, Samuel and Stephen Longfellow, John Gliddon and Joseph Bowler. The township was surveyed in August, 1800, by William Davis. The act of incorporation was passed June 23, 1804. The churches in this town are those of the Baptists, Free Baptists, and Methodists. The number ot public schoolhouses is 13 ; and their value is set at $3,500. The population in 1870 was 1,223. In 1880 it was 1,118. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $241,433. In 1880 it was $254,966. PalniyTfli lies in the south-western part of Somerset County, 20 miles east by north-east from Skowhegan. It is bounded on the north by St. Albans, south by Detroit and Pittsfield, and west by the latter and Hartland ; on the east, it is bounded by Newport in Penob- scot County. There are six ponds shown on the county map, three of which are very small. Palmyra Village lies at the centre of the town on a stream connecting two ponds, \u2014 one just north-east, the other near by on the south-west of the village. There is water-power on this stream at the village, occupied by a shingle-mill. Others are on Madawaska and Indian streams. Sebasticook River, the outlet of Moose Pond in Hartland, runs through the western part of the town, but has no considerable fall in Palmyra. The occupation of the people is almost wholly agricultural. The surface of the town is rolling, but without high hills. The soil is quite productive, especially in hay and grain. Large stocks of cattle are kept, and most farmers have saved money. The roads are generally good, and the scenes are pleasant to look upon. A stage-line from the Maine Central Railroad station in Pittsfield passes through Palmyra to Cambridge, and the village is also the terminus of the daily mail-stage to Newport. This township was purchased of Massachusetts by a Mr. Barnard of New Hampshire, for 12\u00a3 cents an acre, and subsequently sold by him to Dr. John Warren of Boston; and in 1798, it was surveyed by Samuel Weston. The first settlei was Daniel Gale, who removed his family here in 1800. The town was incorporated in 1807, and in 1824 a national post-office was established here. There are Christian, Free Baptist, Methodist and Advent societies in the town, and also a Union Church edifice. The number of public schoolhouses is 15, having a value of $5,000. The population in 1870 was 1,322. In 1880 it was 1,271. The valuation in 1870 was $347,097. In 1880 it was $357,461. Paris is an interesting town in the south-eastern part of Oxford County, of which it is the capital. It is 46 miles N.N.W. of Portland on thfe Grand Trunk Railway. Woodstock bounds it on the north,"], [434, "426 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Sumner, Buckfield and Hebron on the east, Oxford on the south, Norway and Greenwood on the west. Its length north-west and south-east is nearly 12 miles, the width is about 6 miles, and its area some 70 square miles. The surface is quite uneven. Streaked Mountain, just over its eastern line, is the highest elevation ; but there are numerous high hills within the town, \u2014 as Spruce, Cobble, Jump-Off and Berry Ledge hills in the north part of the town, \u2014 Ones, Paris and Crocker's hills and Mount Mica in the middle, \u2014 and Singepole and Number Four hills in the southern part. The little Androscoggin River runs through the whole length of the town, and near it, for the whole distance, lies the track of the Grand Trunk Railway. The principal tributaries to this river within the town are the outlet to Moose Pond in the north eastern part, Stone's Brook, near the middle, and Stony Brook, which enters the river at South Paris Village. Another sheet of water called Hall's Pond lies in the south-eastern part of the town. There is much beautiful scenery in Paris, and the roads are excel lent. The principal villages are South Paris, Paris Hill, West and North Pans. Snow's Falls, on the river, toward the north part of the town, received their name from the tragic death near them of a man named Snow, who was hunting there. Paris Hill, near the centre of the town, is the most elevated village in the county, \u2014 and probably in the State. The open square on the hilltop, upon which the county buildings stand, presents an aspect at once rural, elegant, and from its command ing view, impressive. The village is a healthy location, and a favorite summer resort. Before the days of railroads this was a very thriving place. At South Paris the Norway Branch Railway forms a junction with the main line of the Grand Trunk. On the falls here are mills con taining flouring, board, shingle, planing and barrel machinery. Here also is an iron foundry and machine-shop, and other small manu factures. The other station on the Grand Trunk is West Paris, in the north-western part of the town, where is a good water-power, improved by a flouring mill. There is also a furniture-factory driven by steam power. At North Paris a water-power is supplied by the outlet of Moose Pond (about f of a mile square), upon which a grist-mill was erected very soon after the first settlement of the place, and has been occupied ever since. Altogether the town has twelve powers, \u2014 all improved and occupied. There are three grist-mills, and factories making agricultural implements, railroad wheelbarrows, sleds and child's carriages, bed steads, wooden boxes, brackets, coopers' ware, chairs (two factories), shoes, canned vegetables, paper pulp, and leather board, mowing machines, metal work, ground plaster, etc. The soil of this town is of every variety, but there is very little clay. For pasturage and hay crops, it excels. \u2014 being one of the best stock and dairy farm towns in the State. There are many large apple orchards, which have been a source of large income. The first apple and pear tree were brought by Lemuel Jackson from Massachusetts in 1780. This township was originally granted in 1771 to Capt. Joshua Fuller, of Watertown, and the sixty-four privates of his company, for services in the French and Indian wars ; but many of these were dead and the property really came to their heirs instead. The first settlement was made in 1779 on the site of the present village of Paris Hill by John Daniels, Deacon John Willis, Joseph Willis, Benjamin Hammond,"], [435, "PARKMAN. 427 Lemuel Jackson, and Uriah Ripley, from Middleborough, Mass Mr. Daniels, it is stated, purchased the land now occupied by Paris Hill Village, of the Indians, the price paid being an iron kettle. Joseph Daniels, born February, 1784, is the first native citizen. The first church here was Calvinist-Baptist, organized in 1795, and Elder James Hooper, of Berwick, was the same year ordained as their pastor, the ceremony being performed in a barn. He filled this office for nearly half a century. The first house for public worship was erected by the Baptists at Paris Hill in 1803. There are now in town societies of the Baptists, Congregationalists, Free Baptists, two of the Universalists, and three of the Methodists. Some of the church edifices are fine structures. The town was incorporated June 20, 1793, and on the oiganization of Oxford County in 1805, became its shire town. Paris was the birth-place and residence through minority of Hon. Hannibal Hamlin, many years a United States senator from Maine, and vice-president for one term with Lincoln. Hon. Sidney Perham, who was six years in Congress and three years Governor of Maine, resides in Paris 11 ill Village. This town has also furnished six other members of Congress, namely : Levi Hubbard, Albion K. Paris, Enoch Lincoln, Timothy J. Carter, Rufus K. Goodenow, and Charles Andrews, of whom the last only was a native. Of these, Paris and Lincoln were also governors of the State, and the first a United State senator. Paris Hill Academy was long a flourishing and superior school, but has given way to the high schools and the Oxford Normal Institute. The latter, located at South Paris, is a flourishing and excellent school. District No. 16 has a library, known as the Prentiss Library, having 800 volumes. The \"Oxford Democrat,\" an excellent country paper, is published here by George H. Watkins. South Paris Savings Bank, on Nov. 1, 1880, held in deposits and profits $132,011.16. The number of public schoolhouses in this town is 20, valued with lots and apparatus at $10,000. The population in 1870 was 2,765. In 1880 it was 2,930. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $977,975. In 1880 it was $985,274. Parker'S Head, a post-office and village in Phippsburg, Sagadahoc County. Parklll ail is situated in the south-western part of Piscataquis County, 12 miles west of Dover, and 4 miles from the Bangor and Pis cataquis Railway station in Abbot. The latter town lies onthe north ; on the east is Sangerville ; on the west Wellington ; and on the south, Cambridge, in Somerset County. It has an area of 25,000 acres ; and a laro-e proportion of it is excellent for farming purposes. Watson's Hill is the greatest elevation of land. Bennett and Harlow Ponds are the principal bodies of water. There are several saw-mills and a grist mill in the town. At Parkman Corner there are several mechanic shops, four stores and one hotel. The township was early purchased by Samuel Parkman, Esq., of Boston. The first settlers were Peter and William Cummings, Ephraim Andrews, Arvida Briggs, William Brewster, and Richard Caswell. Samuel Parkman also early moved in and became the proprietor's agent. He settled near the centre of the town where he put a saw and grist mill in operation. Mr. Pingree was a hatter by trade, and"], [436, "428 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. made the first hats produced in the county. Edward Soul 3, from Free port, was one of the earlier settlers. In the war of 1812 he was three times taken prisoner by different British cruisers, and the last time was confined for fourteen months in the famous Dartmoor prison, only to be compared with Libby and Andersonville. The preaching of Rev. Zenas Hall, in 1818, led to the organization of a Baptist church in the town. The township bore the name of Plantation Number Five, Sixth Range, until 1822, when it was incorporated as the town of Parkman. The first store in town was opened at the Corner about 1827 by Thomas Seabury. The first physician was Dr. Nicholas Jumper, who, about 1834, was succeeded by Dr. A. J. W. Stevens, who died iu 1875. Besides attending to his practice, Dr. Stevens represented the town in the legislature, and was an able temperance lecturer. Dr. George Parkman, after his father's death, succeeded to his lands in this town ; and previous to his own tragical death, visited the place annually. The Baptist and the Christian denomination have each a church-edifice in the town. Parkman has fifteen public schoolhouses valued at $4,500. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $259,304. The rate of taxation in 1880 was about two per cent. The population in 1870 was 1,105. By the census of 1880 it is 1,005. The valuation in 1880 was $249,211. Parlill Poild, a post-office and settlement and pond at West Forks, on the Kennebec, in Somerset County. ParSOnsfield is the north-west town in York County, and is bounded on its western side by New Hampshire. Porter and Hiram lie on the north, Cornish and Limerick on the east, and Newfield on the south. It has an area of about 22,000 acres. The Ossipee River forms the northern boundary line, and furnishes at Kezar Falls the principal water-power of the town. At this place there is a set of saw, shingle, and grain mills, another on South River, in the western part of the town ; and there are several smaller ones in the various parts of the town. The principal business centres are East Parsonfield, Kezar Falls, North Parsonfield, Parsonsfield Village, South Parsonsfield, West Parsonsfield and Lord's Mills. Long Pond, Mudget and Spruce are the largest ponds, and there are as many more of smaller size. The surface of the town is very rough and hilly. The greatest elevations are Cedar Mountain in the central part, and Randall Mountain in the eastern. The soil in general, though rocky, is fertile, yielding good crops of hay and grain. The scenery from almost every eminence is grandly beautiful. Scarcely more than 20 miles to the north, slightly west, the White Hills of New Hampshire lift their rugged peaks above the clouds. In the intervening space, smaller hills, some covered with verdure, others broken with rocks, with smiling green valleys between, dotted numerously with neat farm-houses and bright little villages form many a pleasing picture. Parsonsfield is part of a tract of land sold in 1661 by the Indian chief, Captain Sunday, to Francis Small, who conveyed an individual half to Major Nicholas Shapleigh, of Kittery. The original deed of Small was found in 1770, and the descendants of the two tenants in common took formal possession. Again in 1771 a partition was effected, when the territory comprised in this township fell to the claimants"], [437, "PASSADUMKEAG. 429 under Shapleigh, who immediately conveyed it to Thomas Parsons and 39 associates. The town was shortly afterward surveyed into hundred acre lots, two of which were reserved to each proprietor, nine for the use and support of the schools and churches, and one for a mill privi lege. Twelve families settled upon or near these lots in 1772 ; John and Gideon Doe settled in the western part of the town in 1775 ; and soon after George Kezar settled in the eastern part. The town was incorporated in 1785, under its present name, in honor of Thomas Par sons, one of the largest early proprietors. The town has been the residence or birth-place of many distingushed men. Hon. Rufus Mclntire was a graduate of Dartmouth College, be came a member of the York County bar in 1812, soon after recruited a company and marched to the northern frontier, remaining in active service until the close of the war. He was afterward elected to Con gress for four consecutive terms, commencing December, 1827. He was. land agent under Governor Fairfield, Marshal of Maine under President Polk, and Surveyor of Customs under President Pierce. Hon. James W. Bradbury of Augusta, was the son of Dr. James Brad bury, an eminent physician of Parsonsfield. Elder John Buzzell, after long service in teaching and in the ministry, removed to Parsonsfield in 1798, remaining until his death in 1864, in the ninety-sixth year of his age. He united with the Free-will Baptists when that denomina tion numbered but 101. He was the author and editor of many publi cations, and he and Dr. Moses Sweat, a resident physician, were the chief means of establishing the North Parsonsfield Seminary, the first institute of learning under the auspices of the denomination. Hon. L. D. M. Sweat, of Portland, is a son of Dr. Moses Sweat. William B. Wedgewood, LL.D., elected vice-chancellor of the university at Wash ington, D.C., in 1870 is a native of Parsonsfield. Hon. Zenas P. Went worth, late of Houlton, Maine, was also a native. One of the old men of the town is Deacon Elisha Waldleigh, who at the age of one hundred, rode 4 miles to deposit his vote. The first church in town was built in 1790 by the town proprietors, and a parsonage in 1794. There are now in town, churches of the Con gregationalists, Baptists, Old School Free-will Baptists, Free Bap tists (three churches) and Advents. Parsonsfield has seventeen public schoolhouses, valued at $4,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $632,970; in 1880 it was $563,075. The population in 1870 was 1,804; in 1880 it was 1,613. PaSSadlinikeag\", in Penobscot County, lies on the east bank of the Penobscot River, 31 miles north-east of Bangor. It is bounded by Enfield on the north, Lowell on the east, Greenbush on the south, and Edinburg on the west, but separated from the last by Pe nobscot River. The territory is about 6| miles in length along the river, and 3\u00a3 of a mile in average width. The surface is varied and interesting, with good soil. The largest streams are Passadumkeag, and its tributary, Cold Stream, outlet of the large pond of the same name, situated just outside the north-western angle of the town. There is a saw-mill, containing board, shingle, lath and stave mills. The vil lage is situated on the Penobscot at the mouth of the Passadumkeag, near the middle line of the town. There is here a large steam-mill, manufacturing large lumber, boards, shingles and staves. Other manu factures are coopers' ware, carriages, etc. Farming and lumbering arc"], [438, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 430 the chief occupations of the people. The European and North Ameri can Railway passes through the length of the town, having a station at the village. Passadumkeag was incorporated in Jan., 1835. The name is an Indian word, supposed to signify quick water. In 1842, about one third of the territory was set off, and annexed to Lowell. On Passa dumkeag Island there are the remains of an old fort, said to have been built by the French and Indians. There is here a Congregationalist society, though meetings of other denominations are sometimes held in the town. There are four public schoolhouses, valued at $800. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $30,738. In 1880 it was $42,662. The rate of taxation is 3 per cent. on a low valuation. The population in 1870 was 243. In 1880 it was 302. PattagTimpilS, a post-office in Penobscot County, Patten lies on the eastern border of Penobscot County, 96 miles from Bangor. It was incorporated April 16th, 1841, having been No. 4 of Range 6. Mount Chase (Monterey planta tion on Chace's map of the State, 1862), bounds it on the north, and Crystal, in Aroostook County, on the east. Other townships adjacent are unsettled. Patten is heavily timbered and has a good soil. Fish Stream and Hersey Brook, tributaries of the Mattawamkeag, are the principal water-courses. There is a small pond in the western part of the town having one of these streams as an outlet. The village is sit uated in the eastern part of the tow-n on Mattawamkeag Stream. The manufactories are at this point; and consist of one lumber-mill, a sash, door and blind factory, a grist-mill with two sets of stones, a tin-ware factory, a wheelwright shop, a tin-shop, etc. This town is the terminus of Jones' and Laing's stage line from Mattawamkeag. Patten Academy was incorporated in 1846, and has been and is still, a valuable institution to the whole region. The number of pub lic schoolhouses in the town is six, which have an estimated value of $1,200. There are here three churches, a Congregationalist, Methodist and Baptist. The valuation in 1870 was $191,342. In 1880 it was $198,358. The population in 1870 was 704. In 1880 it was 716. Pea COVe, a post-office in Oldtown, Penobscot County.

Peiliaqilid Patent was the last grant made by the New England C unpany within the limits of our State. It was issued in"], [439, "PEMBROKE. 431 1631, and comprised the territory between the Medomac and Damaris cotta Rivers, and far enough north to include 12,000 and an additional 100 acres for every man who should settle within its limits during the seven following years. It was a charter as well as a patent, including rights of government, wherefore Pemaquid became a seat of govern ment independent of all others in New England. The earliest settle ment under this patent, says Williamson, seems to have been on the western banks of Pemaquid River. See article on Bristol. Pem Droke lies on the north-west side of Lubec Bay in the south-eastern part of AVashington County. Its greatest length is north-west and south-east, above 8^- miles ; and its width is about 3\u00a3. Perry lies on its north-east side, Charleston on the north, Dennysville and Edmunds on the south-west. The surface of the town is uneven, but without lofty-- eminences. The land is well suited for agriculture, and the town is becoming one of the best in this respect. Pemma quan River, the principal stream in the town, furnishes not less than five good water-powers, all of which are occupied. There are two mills for manufacturing long and short lumber, a planing-mill and a sash and blind factory, two grist-mills, and works of the Pembroke Iron Company. These consist of furnaces, rolling-mill, machine-shop, etc. The main building of this establishment is 171 feet wide and 160 feet long. The dam is of stone, and the power is very uniform. Gen eral Ezekiel Foster, an enterprising merchant of Eastport, was the originator of this enterprise, having commenced building the work in 1832. They were operated by Foster and Bartlett for a few years, then sold to Gray & Co., of Boston. In 1849, they were purchased by William E. Coffin & Co., of Boston, the present proprietors. For fif teen years prior to 1873, these works did an extensive business in the manufacture of iron spikes, rivets and other articles. The iron pro duced here is said to be surpassed by very few factories. The southern shores of this town are washed by the sea ; and there are several places where the flow of the tide in and out of basins might be made available for mills. The chief natural curiosity of the town is Cobscook Falls, formed by the tide, which rushes tumutuously through a narrow passage over rugged rocks, into and out of an immense basin or reservoir. The bay formed by the mouth of the Pemmaquan is easy of access and safe. During the century in which the town has been settled, though every year a hundred vessels visit the harbor, not one was ever lost within its precincts. Shipbuilding began in this town as early as 1825 ; yet the vessels built were very few until Hon. S. C. Foster, in 1844, commenced the industry, constructing in a few years quite a fleet. In 1860 the business had so increased that there were in the town seven ship-yards. Two only are in operation at present. Many of the vessels built here are for coasting and the fish eries. Pembroke was first settled in 1774, Hatevil Leighton, from Goulds borough, Maine, being the pioneer. Edmund Meagher (Mahar) and William Clark, from Boston, came in 1780, settling near Cobscook Falls. These were followed by Robert Ash, M. Denho, Joseph Bridges, Zadock Hersey, Caleb Hersey, Samuel Sprague, Theophilus and Bela Wilder, Moses Gardiner, Stephen Gardiner, and M. Dunbar, most of whom came from Maine and Massachusetts. Theophilus Wilder is said"], [440, "432 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. to have become a resident as early as 1740. These pioneer families were marked by industrious and frugal habits, a love of order, and the stern virtues of our illustrious ancestors. The proprietors of the lands in this town were Thomas Russell, John Lowell and General Benjamin Lincoln, of Revolutionary fame. The Herseysand Theophilus Wilder were soldiers in the war for independence ; and the latter was a cap tain in the army under General Gates, and present at the surrender of Burgoyne. Pembroke was a part cf Dennysville until Feb. 4, 1832, when it was set off and incorporated. Hon. Stephen C. Foster, a native of East Machias, but long a resident of Pembroke, represented his district in Congress from 1857 to 1861. Union Church, the first in the town, was erected in 1842. Robert Crosset, a Congregationalist, was the first settled minister. Now there are also a Baptist and a Catholic society, and two Methodists. Pem broke has 13 public schoolhouses, valued at $15,000. There is a high school, and the village schools are graded. The population in 1870 was 2,551. In 1880 it was 2,324. The valuation in 1870 was $388,233. In 1880 it was $409,443. PdlODSCOt is situated in the southern part of Hancock County, having Penobscot Bay on the west, and South Bay (an exten tion of Castine Harbor) in the southern part. Castine lies on the south-west, Sunny and Bluehill on the east, and Orland on the north. The surface is generally level, the greatest eminence being Togus Hill, which has a height of perhaps 300 feet. The ponds are Pierce's, Wight's and Turtle. Granite is the prevailing rock. The soil is a clay loam. The crops principally cultivated are wheat, potatoes and hay. There are in operation in town three stave, one saw and one meal and flour mill ; other manufactures are bricks, fish barrels, lime casks, carriages, harnesses, coffins, boots and shoes. There has been quite a business done by a mitten factory, whose annual product has reached $12,000. The Penobscot Mining Company is a corporation of the town. The principal village is at the head of Northern Bay. This is 22 miles from Ellsworth on the Bucksport and Deer Isle stage-line. Penobscot was a district of the ancient Pentagoet. Its name is from the Indian \" Penobskeag,\" or \" Penopeauke,\" signifying a rocky place. In its original form it included Castine and the easterly part of Brooksville, its early history is involved with that of these towns. It was township No. 3, in the grant to David Marsh, and others. The first survey of the town was made by John Peters; and the following names appear among its earliest municipal officers: John Lee, Jere miah and Daniel Wardwell, John and Joseph Perkins, John Wasson, David Hawes, Elijah Littleiield, Isaac Parker and Peltiah Leach. As given by H. B. Wardwell, in Wasson's Survey of Hancock County, the first settlers within the present limits of Penobscot were Duncan and Findley Malcolm, Daniel and Neil Brown. They were Scotchmen, and being loyalists or tories, left for St. Andrews when the English evacuated Bigaduce (Castine) at the close of the Revolution. The first permanent settler was Charles Hutchings, in 1765. The first child of English parents was Mary Hutchings. In 1765 also came Isaac and Jacob Sparks, Daniel Perkins, Samuel Averill and Solomon Littlefield."], [441, "PENOBSCOT COUNTY. 433 Others of the early period were Giles Johnson, Elijah Winslow. Pelatiah Leach, Jonathan Wardwell, Andrew Herrick, David Dunbar, Elijah Littlefield and Eliphalet Lowell, nearly- all of whom came from towns in Maine. Among the notable citizens of a later date were Hon. William Grindle, Samuel Leach and William Eastman, Esqrs. The plantation name of Penobscot was Major-bigwaduce. It was incorporated under its present name in 1787. Castine was set off in 1796, and a portion for Brooksville in 1817. The Methodists have four churches in Penobscot, and the Baptists one. Farmers' clubs and Temperance lodges furnish the public enter tainment. The number of public schoolhouses is twelve ; and the school property is valued at $1,625. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $227,356. In 1880 it was $215,237. The rate of taxa tion in 1880 was 18 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,418. In 1880 it was 1,341. PeilObSCOt Coilllty in its shape appears like many rect angles of various size and form joined in one. Its southern section lies a little south-east of the centre of the State, its eastern extends to within about 25 miles of New Brunswick, while it also sends north ward on a line with Penobscot River a parallelogram whose northern line continued to our eastern boundary would fall but little more than one township south of Mars Hill. Its southern line is divided about midway by the Penobscot River at a distance of some sixty miles from the southern coast-line of the State ; and this river continues to be, in the main, the medial line for the entire length of the county. Within its borders are many small but few large bodies of water. Pushaw Lake, just north of Bangor, is the largest sheet wholly within this county ; Newport Pond at the western border, and Cold Stream Pond on the eastern side of Penobscot River being next in size, re spectively 8, 7\u00a3 and 6 square miles in area. At the south-eastern angle lies the Lower Schoodic group, while at the western line begin the large and numerous lakes of the West Branch of the Penobscot. The largest body of water within the county is found in Milinokett Lake, whose area is 18 square miles. The western edge of this lake lies in Piscataquis County, but five-sixths are in Penobscot. Other consider able rivers having some portion of their length in this county are Aroostook River, which is formed in the northern part ; the Piscata quis River, draining the southern part of Piscataquis County; the Mattawamkeag, fed from south-eastern Aroostook ; and above all the West Branch of the Penobscot, drawing its waters from a succession of lakes in northern Piscataquis and quite from the summits of the western hills that divide Maine from Canada, and send down rills to the Connecticut and St. Lawrence. Some portions of the county are quite hilly, but the only mountains of note are the Chase group north east of Katahdin, and belonging to the same system. In the middle portion of the county there is much slate rock, in the north-eastern portion there is granite, and in the southern, a large tract of argillo micaceous schist. Penobscot County was originally included in Hancock. County. The act establishing it passed the Massachusetts legislature Feb. 15, 1816. The southern boundary was fixed very much as it remains at present; but on the formation of Piscataquis County in 1838, Penob- 28"], [442, "434 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. scot lost 5 ranges of townships north of the lines of Dexter and Brad ford ; and the following year Aroostook County received from it the ranges of townships numbered 3, 4 and 5, north of Mattawamkeag; ami in 1843, it took ranges 6, 7 and 8, north ji townships numbered 8. The area is now 2,760 square miles ; and it embraces one city and 54 towns, 7 organized plantations and 42 townships. From 1814 to 1816 Bangor and Castine were half shire towns of Hancock County; but in Penobscot County, Bangor had the exclusive honor from its establishment. The population in 1870 was 75,150. In 1880 it was 70,478. The valuation in 1870 was $22,697,890. In 1880 it was $21,408,151. Penobscot River and County were occupied, at the periods of dis covery and settlement, by a branch of the Abenaqui nation called Tar ratines by the English, \u2014 of whom the Oldtown Indians are a remnant. When first known by the English they numbered more than 2,000 war riors. About 1660 there was a destructive war between the New England Indians and the Mohawks ; and tradition asserts that the Tar ratines took part in it, but were defeated, and in 1669 were followed to the banks of the Penobscot by their victorious foes. The principal settlement of this tribe was near the mouth of the Kenduskeag. The Penobscot Indians do not appear to have entered as a tribe into the first Indian war, but were actively engaged in most of the subsequent ones. In the war of the Revolution they fortunately adhered to the American cause, and rendered it some service. Roman Catholic mis sionaries came with the first French visitors, and mingling with the Indians, ere long converted them to that faith.* The General Assembly of Massachusetts in 1763 granted 13 town ships, each 6 miles square, lying on the east side of Penobscot River, to 13 companies, or proprietors, who were to lay out the townships, settle 60 families in each, \u2014 and make improvements, \u2014 which was done. The earliest regular settlement of the township commenced at Bangor in 1769; and settlements in other towns following year by year. From 1774 to 1779, John Herbert, the first physician in Bangor, was the principal speaker in the religious meetings, and in the winter taught school. The first minister that preached statedly in this county was Rev. Mr. Knowles, from Cape Cod ; who, about 1780-83, was with the people scattered along the banks of the river from Frankfort to Bangor. The next minister was Rev. Seth Noble, a Congregationalist, a native of Westfield, Mass., but who had resided in Nova Scotia ; where by voice and influence he gave support to the cause of the colonies, and was therefore forced to flee. He came to Bangor in 1786, and was engaged as a religious teacher at \u00a3100 per year. He was installed on SeptriO, in that year, under some ancient oaks near the corner of Oak and Washington streets, Bangor ; Rev. Daniel Little of Wells, deputed by the church in Wells, giving him the charge and the right-hand of fellowship, \u2014 Mr. Noble preaching the sermon. He remained five years, and died in Ohio in 1807. The first Congregational church or ganized in the county was at Brewer, Sept. 9,1800. The Penobscot Congregational Conference was organized at Brownville (then in Penobscot County) in 1825, and embraced three ministers, 8 churches, and 400 members. Rev. Jesse Lee, the Methodist Apostle of New * See article on Oldtown and that ou the Indians in the first part of this work."], [443, "PENOBSCOT RIIER AND BAY. 435 England, in 1793, spent a month in missionary work along the Pe nobscot. In 1795 societies of the Methodists were organized in the county by Rev. Joshua Hall, of the New London Conference (Conn). Rev. Timothy Merrill was placed on the Hampden Circuit in 1799, and preached in Bangor. The first Baptist church was formed in Etna in 1807, by Rev. John Chadbourne of Shaple'gh, missionary of the denomination in the county. About 1809 the first Free Baptist society of the county was organized in Dixmont. The first Episco palian church was gathered in Bangor in 1834, and the first Uni versalist church in Hampden in 1825. The Unitarian church at Bangor was organized in 1818, and the Swedenborgian in 1840. The Christian denomination formed their first churches in Exeter and Newport in 1815, and the Adventists in 1842-43. The production of lumber has always been the most prominent industry of the county. The first railroad in the county and state was the Bangor, Oldtown and Milford, incorporated in 1833, opened in 1836. This was discontinued on the opening of the European and North American Railway. The Maine Central Railroad has 27 miles of its road, i. e from Somerset County to Bangor in this county. The Dexter and Newport Railroad was opened in 1868 as ? branch of the Maine Central. The Bangor and Piscataquis Railroad was chartered in 1861, the construction com menced in the spring of 1869 and completed from Oldtown (where it connects with the European and North American Railway), to Blan chard in the autumn of 1876. The length of this road in the county is 15 miles. The Bucksport and Bangor Railroad was chartered in 1870, the survey- made in the autumn of 1872, the construction commenced in the spring of 1873, and trains began to run regularly over the whole length Dec. 21, 1874. Nine and one-half miles of its 19 are in Penob- scot County. Like the Bangor, Oldtown and Milford, and the Bangor and Piscataquis, it is now a branch of the European and North Amer ican Railway. The military of this county were first called into active service-in. 1814, to repel the British forces ascending the river; again in 1839, they were called out in large force to aid in keeping the peace in Aroos took County during the boundary dispute ; and for a third time in the late civil war. The second Maine regiment, six companies of the Sixth Maine, the Eighteenth Maine regiment, and the First heavy artillery, were composed chiefly of regiments of this county. Monuments in honor of the fallen brave of this war stand in the cemeteries at Bangor, Brewer, Hampden, Dexter, Newport, and perhaps other plaees. PeilObSCOt RiVer and Bay. The Penobscot River has well been called the main artery of the State. Its fluyiatile dis trict illustrates the geographical ideal of the river basin \u2014 appearing as a mere point at the mouth of the stream and interior-ward, expanding symmetrically upon both sides of the central channel, presently em* branching into subordinate basins, themselves disposed likewise about tributary streams, which in their turn break up into still smaller basins located upon still smaller tributaries, until the whole takes on the sim- ilitude of a mighty tree. The greatest length of the Penobscot basin from north to south is 160 miles, its greatest breadth, 115 miles ; area, 8,200 square miles. Eight hundred square miles discharge their sur plus water into the main river, below its lowest water-power, at Ban-"], [444, "436 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. gor. The Penobscot country is less elevated above the sea than the Kennebec, and considerably less than the Androscoggin, as results from the subsidence of the whole State surface from west to east. Yet the northern portion having a mean height of 1,085 feet. The loftiest portion of the basin is at the head waters of the main river (west branch), which has an altitude of from 1,600 to 2,000 feet. The west branch is properly a continuation of the main river which, down to the Mattawamkeag, should be called the Upper Penobscot, as the river below should be called the Lower Penobscot. There are 1,604 streams represented upon the State map in the Penobscot system. The Mat tawamkeag, its largest eastern branch, is 300 feet wide at its mouth, and the Penobscot 500 feet at the same point. The Piscataquis, the largest western branch, is 250 feet wide for 25 miles above its mouth. The mean width of the Penobscot for several miles above Bangor is about 800 feet. From the confluence of the Mattawamkeag to the open sea, the Penobscot has a length of about 120 miles ; from the junction of the Matagamon to the sea, 132 miles ; from its extreme head waters, about 260 miles; or including the windings, 300 miles. The main water-power section extends from Lake Chesuncook to Ban gor, 120 miles, the fall being 900 feet, or via the Mattagamon, from Lake Mattagamon to Bangor, 115 miles, a fall of about 850 feet. The annual discharge is estimated at 319,800,000. The number of lakes and ponds in the basin of the Penobscot, rep resented upon the State map, is 467. Of these 185 are above the lower powers of the main Penobscot, and have a combined surface of 395 square miles. The volume of the river in the vicinity of Bangor as sumed to be 146,250 cubic feet per minute for the 24 hours at the period of extreme low run, the power in the 92 feet of fall from Mil ford to Bangor would be 55,600 horse-power gross, or 2,224,000 spin dles for eleven hours a day. Penobscot Bay forms a fitting entrance to its magnificent river. The head of the bay is 30 miles from the sea, the width for 15 miles from the sea is about 20 miles, while it is 8 miles in width at the head. The islands within it form several towns, and add to its beauty and interest. Everywhere there is sufficient depth for the largest vessels, and open water the year round to Bucksport, some six miles above the head of the bay. A marked feature of the lower ba\\r is its granite island, furnishing the best qualities of this stone in inexhaustible quan tities. As far north as Frankfort and Bucksport, gneiss, schists, gran ite and limestone intermingle, with the first predominating. Thence northward to the Piscataquis, mica-schist prevails, with granite about the Passadumkeag. North of Piscataquis succeeds clay slate ; but on the left bank, schist prevails to some distance north of the Mattawam keag, where clay slate is struck. The last rock occupies much the larger proportion of the northern part of the basin, with granite abun dant about Katahdin, and sandstone north-east of Moosehead Lake, and' mica-schist at the head of the main river, west branch. Slaty rocks are largely in excess of all other forms, and at some points are of unsurpassed quality for roofing purposes. The basin of the Penob scot is mountainous from the sea to above the head of the tide at Ban gor, thence northward, gently undulating, to, into and throughout the region of the east and Mattawamkeag branches, until it is insensibly blended with the valley of the Aroostook. On the main river, above"], [445, ""], [446, "438 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Nicatou, it is more broken, and is singularly diversified with lakes, ponds, swamps, streams, hills, valleys and detached peaks. The Ka tahdin Mountains, the highest in Maine, affording a prospect charac teristic and sublime from the vast breadth of level country overlooked, lie upon the left bank. Further west, the valley becomes merged with that of the Kennebec on the south, and the Allaguash on the north, and terminates on the north-west at the highland boundaries of the State, and in the swamps and lagoons which form the common reser voir of the St. John and Penobscot. At the period when America was still an unknown New World, Spanish, French, Dutch and English navigators alike praised Penob scot Bay and River. The earliest Spanish explorer, Gomez, honored himself by naming the river \"Rio de Gomez; \" and others of his na tion called it \" Rio Grande,\" \" Rio Hermoso,\" \u2014 the great, the beauti ful river. Thevet, the French explorer, visiting it in 1556, described it as \" one of the finest rivers in the whole world.\" Samuel Cham plain, exploring in the service of the French in 1604--5, enthusiastically says, \" The river banks are covered with verdure, and here and there lovely stretches of meadow.\" Judge Godfrey of Bangor, who has studied deeply into the history of this region, says the name of this river was reported by the French in sixty different ways during their occupancy, to 1664. The principal spelling made use of was Panan aushek. The Indian name was Penobsceag or Penobscoote, suggested by the rocky falls just above Bangor. From these, doubtless, the New Plymouth colonists formed the name Penobscot, by which this river was known to them as early as 1626. The Dutch were so well pleased with the region that they sent a man-of-war to it in 1676, and captured the French fortifications on the bay and river. The Dutch were driven off by the English, but the French held possession of a part of the river to 1745, when most of them removed to Canada. On the fall of Quebec, in 1749, the whole passed to the British crown, where the title remained until the Revolution placed it within the borders of a new nation. The first steamboat on the Penobscot was the \" Maine,\" Captain Cram, which arrived in Bangor, May 23, 1824. It ran to Portland during the summer season. The \"Bangor,\" a larger boat, Captain George Barker, was put on the route in 1834. In 1849 small, flat-bot tomed steamers commenced running above Bangor, affording oppor tunity to observe the pleasing scenery of the navigable section of the river. The Sanford line of steamers, by the excellence of its boats and management, has possessed so long the steam transportation between this river and the west as to become historic in its interest. Started as a personal enterprise by Menemon Sanford, in 1845 \u2014 36 years ago, \u2014 it formed soon after a union with the Kennebec Steamship Com pany, the joint line becoming known under the name of the San ford Independent Line. The first steamer put upon the line was the Penobscot, followed, in a few years, by the Boston, each about 600 tons burthen. In 1852 tin lines were divided, the Penobscot boats re taining the name of the combined lines. In 1859 the Menemon San ford, of 900 tons, and the Kennebec, of 500 tons, were added to the line. In 1862 the Katahdin, of 1,200 tons, and 1867 the Cambridge, of 1,500 tons, were added, the six boats having been built by Englis in New York, for Captain Sanford. In 1875, the present company was"], [447, "PENOBSCOT RIVER AND BAY. 439 formed with a capital of $500,000. The Sanford and the Boston, while under lease to the government, during the late war, were lost, the first on the Florida Keys and the second in one of the South Carolina bayous. The Penobscot was sold to private parties, and the Kennebec, while under charter to government, was lost or disabled so that she never returned to the company. The boats now on the line are the Cambridge, commanded by Capt. Otis Ingraham, the Katahdin, Capt. W. R. Roix, and the New Brunswick, Capt. F. C. Homer. Trips each way are now made daily, Sundays excepted, during the summer, be tween Boston and the Penobscot, also Mount Desert, five days in the week, by connection with another line of steamers at Rockland. A new steamer of 1,500 tons is now building in the yard of Messrs. Smith & Townsend, at East Boston. Though the river closes by ice at Ban gor, for 125 days on an average, each year, it is rarely frozen aver so as to stop steam navigation below Bucksport, which being connected with Bangor by railroad, becomes a convenient winter-port for this noble city. Only from a balloon could a better view of Penobscot Bay be obtained of the shores than from the fine steamers that ply this river and along the coast. After passing Cape Ann eastward to the Penobscot the first land to be seen is the high and solitary Monhegan Island, visible to early risers on the boats; next Whitehead Point is noticed, and several islands, of which Dix Island, remarkable for its granite, is most interesting. Away to the right now are the ancient \" Fox Islands,\" the two principal ones constituting the towns of Vinal haven and North Haven ; the rugged and historic promontory of Owl's Head is passed, whose fog-bells are silent and whose flashing light grows more and more spirit-like in the dawning day ; and then the city of Rockland gleams along the level line of her shore ; and among the hills perchance arises the scarcely-visible smoke from her numer ous lime-kilns. Next Camden, nestling in a nook of the hills on a deep angle of the bay, is seen ; and north of the village Mount Battie and high Megunticook send their spurs down to the very shore. North port, with its camp-meeting cottages and oak groves, is next noted \u2014 pressing out its bold shores ; then the hill-side city of Belfast is seen smiling over its expansive bay. Beyond this, Sear's Island thrusts its level plain across the steamer's course, and breezy Fort Point, with its summer hotels, quickly hides the gleaming village of Stockton. Oppo site the head of the high, barren Wetmore Isle (town of Verona), the granite walls of Fort Knox, with their dark port-holes, command re spectful attention. Then the steamer feels the swifter current of Bucks port Narrows, and a sudden turn reveals on the right the bright village of Bucksport, with the Methodist East Maine Conference Seminary at the height of the eminence, attracting the eye by its bold relief. The river now becomes more narrow and picturesquely sinuous, and vessels lumber-laden glide sea-ward leaving fresh odors of pine and cedar upon the breeze ; while on the left towers the granite mass of Mount Waido, with Mounts Heagan and Mosquito nearly in line. Then the buxom village of Winterport presents itself to the eye, and we turn from it, and round the intrusive capes above ; then watch Hampden's long narrow village until we catch glimpses of Bangor and Brewer on their commanding hills, where our voyage ends. Descending the river, the same objects engage our attention until we reach the bold bluff of the Castine promontory on our left, with its sea-ward looking village on"], [448, "440 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. the southern slope. North Haven and Vinalhaven with their rocks and woody points, are passed, and the long shores of Little and Great Deer Isles, and we reach the freer waters of Isle-au-Haut Bay, and dis cover the bold shore and the mountain-saddle of Isle-au-Haut, the land's end of the eastern side of the noble Penobscot.* Perliani PlantaiOll, in Aroostook County, lies in range 4, and is numbered 14. It is separated from Caribou by Woodland Plantation, and has Wade Plantation on the south. It is 64 miles N. N. W., of Houlton, via Caribou. The nearest railroad connection is at Caribou, ten miles distant. The Little Madawaska Lake lies on the northern border, and Salmon Brook Lake a little north of the centre of the town. The principal streams are Salmon Brook, West Branch of Salmon Brook, and West Branch of Caribou River. The plantation has one saw and shingle-mill. In this plantation is a valuable iron mine, the ore yielding about 44 per cent, of iron, quite free from sulphur. The underlying rock is calcareous slate. The soil is loamy, and free from stones. Potatoes, wheat and hay are the leading crops. The usual trees flourish in the forests. There is a large quantity of land reserved for schools. The first settlement in this township was made in 1860. It was organized as a plantation in 1867, being named in honor of Hon. Sid ney Perham, subsequently governor of the State. There is a Baptist society here, who sustain a minister. There are three public school houses, and the school property is valued at $1,100. The population in 1870 was 79. In 1880 it was 346. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $12,905. In 1880 it was $31,073. The rate of taxation was one cent on the dollar. PerkinS in Sagadahoc County, lies in the Kennebec River between Richmond on the west bank and Dresden in Lincoln County, on the east. Its length is about 3^ miles and 4J in width. It bore the name of Swan Island almost from the time when it was first known until its separation from Dresden and incorporation under its present name in 1847. It lies 14 miles north of Bath, on the line of the Ken nebec, Portland and Boston steamers. The nearest railroad station is at East Bowdoinham for the southern part and Richmond village for the northern. The town is mostly level, and is well wooded and fer tile. When first discovered by Europeans, the island was the residence of Sebenoa, the sachem of the lower Kennebec. Col. Church and his men in 1692 had a conflict wjth a large body of savages at this place, in which the Indians were routed, some escaping to the mainland, and some to their fort at Teconnet, near Waterville. The post-office for the town is Richmond. Perkins has one public schoolhouse, valued at $600. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $36,792. In 1880 it was $37,594. The population in 1870 was 71. In 1880 it was 78. PerkinS Plantation is situated in the southern part of Franklin County, between Temple and Carthage, and on the stage-line from Wilton to Weld. Originally it was a part of Carthage. Its * For further information in regard to these points, see the towns in which they belong."], [449, "PERRY. 441 dimensions are 3 miles from north-east to south-west, and 4 miles in a direction at right angles with this ; but the south-eastern corner is notched by Washington Plantation (formerly No. 4), to the extent of nearly two square miles. The nearest railway station is at Farmington, 18 miles distant. Originally, with Washington Plantation, it was a part of Carthage, but was set off and called Number 4. Its plantationh ame is in honor of Dr. Perkins of Farmington, who early owned the territory. The nearest post-office is Weld. The plantation has a church of the Christian denomination. There are three schoolhouses, which, together with other school property, are valued at $600. The valuation in 1880 was $22,067. The population in 1870 was 149. In 1880 it was 134. Perry lies on Passamaquoddy Bay, in the south-east part of Washington County. Robbinston bounds it upon the north and Pepi broke on the west. On the south is Lubee Bay and Eastport, and on the east is Passamaquoddy Bay. The town is about 7\u00a3 miles in ex treme length, and 5 miles is the greatest width, but following the inden tations and projections of the shore it has about 40 miles of sea-coast. Nosahick Pond, or Boyden Lake, the principal body of water, is about 5 miles long and 2 miles wide. Little River, its outlet, is the prin cipal stream affording several good mill sites. On these are saw-mills, manufacturing laths, staves, and boxes ; also a grist-mill and a carding mill. The shores of Perry are bold, and the adjacent waters deep ; so that vessels of 100 tons can, in most places, lie so near as to be laden from the bank by wheeling the cargo from 50 to 80 feet. The tide rises here thirty feet. The surface of the town is free from large hills, but the southern part is very rocky and uneven. Pigeon Hill \u2014 about 100 feet in height \u2014 -.is the principal eminence. The underlying rock is sandstone, and the soil gravelly loam. Hay is the leading crop; and there is a pretty good stock of cattle kept. Pine, spruce and cedar are the chief forest trees. Most of the eastern shore is well settled, but at no point is there much of a village. There is a good brick town hall, and the public property generally is in good repair. Private buildings, also throughout the town are mostly well cared for, and some are quite tasteful and attractive. The nearest railroad station is at St. Stephens, in New Brunswick, 20 miles distant. The town is 36 miles north-east of Machias, and 20 miles from Calais. The stage-line from Eastport to Calais passes through Perry. This was formerly Plantation No. 1. The township was purchased of Massachusetts, 1783-4 by Gen Benjamin Lincoln and others, on condition that the proprietors should place here twenty settlers within a given time, and give to each 100 acres of land. The township was full of noble woods, and for many years the principal occupation of the people was getting out timber, spars, shingles and other articles, and transporting these to St. Andrews and Robbinston, and, later, Eastport, carrying thither these products, and bringing back provisions and rum. In 1808, the plantation felt very sensibly the effect of the wars in Europe. Buonaparte had stopped the shipment of timber from the Baltic by the English, and in consequence they sought for this necessary material on the shores of Passamquoddy Bay. Fed by"], [450, "442 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. the trade this business brought, St. Andrews grew up very rapidly, and surrounding places obtained some share of the inflowing wealth. This was then the El Dorado of the State. One man alone got out timber in ten days that brought him $300 ; and it was no uncommon event for a man to come home with $500 or $1,000 in his pocket, the proceeds of the sale of his lumber. Money could be obtained so much more easily by lumbering than by the slow returns of agricultural toil, that when the timber was gone, general poverty followed their waste ful methods. Farming, coasting and the fisheries are now the principal occupations. At Pleasant Point, forming the south-eastern extremity of the town, is a settlement of the Passamaquoddy Indians. [See article on Indians in the first part of this volume.] Perry was incorporated Feb. 12, 1880. Peter Goulding and Rob inson Palmer are mentioned as its most esteemed citizens. One hun dred and thirty-one men were sent to the Union army from this town during the war of the Rebellion ; and of these 43 were lost. The Con gregationalists, Baptists and Methodist have societies here, and the two first have church edifices. The number of public schoolhouses is eleven. The school property is valued at $2,200. The population in 1870 was 1,449. In 1880 it was 1,047. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $205,592. In 1880 it was $172,921. The rate of taxation was two per cent, in the latter year. Pem lies on the south side of the Androscoggin in the eastern part of Oxford County. On the north, separated by the Androscoggin, are Mexico and Dixfield ; on the east is Canton ; on the south, Hart ford and Sumner ; on the west, Franklin and Rumford. Worthley Pond, 3 miles in length by half a mile in width, lies in the southern part of the town, and two small ponds in the south-west are the source of the east branch of Twenty-Mile River. Near the middle of the town is a group of five large hills, of which the most notable are Poland Mountain and Tumble Down Dick, perhaps 1,000 feet in height. On the southern line is Ricker Mountain, with Stockwell Hill in the north ern part. The rock is granite, and the soil a dark loam. The latter is quite free from stones, and ploughed fields are often found even to the top of the hills. Hay is the largest crop, and much attention is given to sheep raising and hop growing. The town has five lumber mills, manufacturing long and short lumber, wooden bowls, etc. There are also found the other small manufactures common in rural-towns. The buildings generally throughout the town are in good repair, and the inhabitants seem thrifty. The nearest railroad connection is at Canton, 8 miles down the river from the centre of the town. The nucleus of this town was a grant of two miles square, made by Massachusetts, to Merrill Knight, Daniel Lunt, William Brackett and a Mr. Bradish of Falmouth. Mr. Knight was the first settler, coming in with his family in 1793. William Walker, Osborn Trask, and Brady Bailey, also of Falmouth, soon followed. Subsequently, the remainder of the township was granted or sold in tracts to E. Fox, Lunt, Thomp son and Peck. The settlement was organized as a plantation in 1812, and incorporated in 1821. Samuel R. Thurston, the first delegate from Oregon Territory to Congress, was a native of this town. Timothy Ludden, Jonas Greene,"], [451, "PHILLIP. 443 Sumner R. Newell, Benjamin Lovejoy and James II. Withington were also esteemed citizens or natives. There is one person living in town above 90 years of age, one about 88. two about 79, and ten that are 75 and upwards. Peru sent 108 men into the army of the Union during the war of the Rebellion, and 30 were killed or had died by sickness prior to Nov. 8th, 1865. There is a very good church edifice in the town, and societies of Baptists, Methodists and Universalists. Two high schools are sustained during a portion of the year. There are eleven public schoolhouses, and the school property has a value of $6,000. The population in 1870 was 931. In 1880 it was 825. The valuation in 1870 was $272,864. In 1880 it was $247,160. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 16 mills on the dollar. PlllllipS is situated near the middle of Franklin County, and is bounded by Madrid and Salem on the north, the latter and Freeman on the east, Avon and Weld on the south, and Number Six on the west. The town is about nine miles in length and five in width. The original area was 22,490 acres, but a section at the north-eastern corner was set off to form Salem in 1823. Sandy River runs south-eastward across the middle of the town. The surface of Phillips is not greatly varied with hills and valleys. French Hill, in the eastern part of the town, is a broad but not a high elevation. Bald Hill, marking the western angle of Avon on the southern line of Phillips, is probably the highest eminence ; its summit being nearly 800 feet above the sea. The prevailing rock is mica-schist, with some granite, and one bed of azoic limestone. The Mammoth Rock is one of the curiosities of Phillips. It is situated on Daggett's Farm, on the side of a hill. The rock is an immense bowlder, variously estimated from 35 to 50 feet high, 100 feet through, and 200 to 300 feet around the base. The trees found in the woods are chiefly rock-maple and beech, with some poplar, spruce and hemlock. The soil on the uplands is a strong loam, but rocky. There are broad, rich intervals along Sandy River; a belt of light sandy land runs through one edge of the town. The occupation of the people is chiefly agricultural. Hay is the largest crop. The principal village is situated on Sandy River near the south line of the town. On the falls here are a saw, grist and carding-mill. The manu- factures of the place consist principally of woollens, furniture, boots and shoes, carriages, harnesses, lumber, meal and flour. A few years since, it might have been said that there were two flourishing villages in the town, between which there was a considerable rivalry. Now, however, the three-fourths of a mile which separated them is occupied by an attractive school-edifice, a costly church, a large new public house, and neat and showy private residences, so that the traveller is unable to find any dividing line between them. The united villages should flourish more than ever now, being the terminus of the narrow gauge Sandy River Railroad, which connects with the Maine Central Road at Farmington. Around the village, too, is a larger territory naturally dependent upon it as a business centre than about any other village in the county. Its water-power is capable of many rimes the development it has already attained. This village is also the headquarters of extensive lumbering operations in the Rangeley Lake region. It is already the location of a large amount of profes sional aud business ability, and of culture and refinement. A printing"], [452, "444 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. press has been established here, and the energetic, newsy and spicy \" Phillips Phonograph \" is regularly issued every Saturday. It is pub lished by O. M. Moore, and is well worthy of the patronage of the best citizens of Franklin County. Another literary institution of private ownership is a circulating library of about 400 volumes. The township of Phillips was granted by Massachusetts to Jacob Abbott, Esq., in 1794. Some improvements were made in the town ship as early as 1790 or 1791. Among the early settlers were Perkins Allen, Seth Greely, Jonathan Pratt, Uriah and Joseph Howard and Isaac Davenport. The plantation was first called Curvo, a name ap plied by Captain Perkins Allen, because of a resemblance to a port of that name which he had visited. It was incorporated in 1812, under the name of a former principal proprietor. A natural curiosity is a huge bowlder about 80 feet in diameter. Another is the nearly dry bed of a pond in the upland, and the gorge through which its,unloosed waters ploughed their way toward Sandy River. This action arose from the insertion of a plank flume, with bulkhead and gate, for the purpose of increasing the power for the grist mill of the Messrs. Noyes on a neighboring stream. A slight leak increased, so that the flume was pressed out, when the whole con tents of the stream swept down the incline, ploughing up the soil, moving great rocks, sweeping away the buildings of a Mr. Shephard, the mill and every vestige of the improvements which had been made at such cost. There are two church-edifices in Phillips, one of which belongs to the Methodists, while the other is a Union church. The town has fifteen public school-houses ; which, with other school property, are estimated to be worth $4,000. The estates in 1870 were valued at $375,576. In 1880 the valuation was $447,905. The rate of taxation in the latter year was fifteen mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,373. In 1880 it was 1,437. Ph-ipsTblirg\" constitutes the southern point of Sagadahoc County. It lies between the Kennebec River on the east, and New Meadows Harbor and West Bath, on the west. On the opposite side of this harbor is Great Island, a part of Harpswell. On the eastern 6ide are the island towns of Arrowsie and Georgetown. Bath lies at the north-west. Phipsburg is very nearly 12^ miles in extreme length and of an average width of about 3 miles. Bays and inlets mark its entire circumference. Following the shore north-eastward from Cape Small Point, we pass the inlet known as Sprague's and Morse's rivers, succeeded by Hunniwell's Beach; north which Hunniwell's Point and Sabino peninsula form the eastern shore of Atkins' Bay. On its north ern side rises the lofty bluff of Coxe's Head, upon which, in 1814, an earthwork was erected ; beyond which is Wyman's Bay. At the north looms Parker's Head, and at its south-western side is the inlet basin forming the tide-power known as Parker's Head Mill Pond. Next succeed the harbor at Phipsburg Center, with Drumraore Bay two miles above, with inlet and tide-power. Through Fiddler's Reach, a curve of the Kennebec around the northern end of Phipsburg, we pass to Winnegance Creek, nearly three miles in length, and a basin at its extremity, forming two unsurpassed tide-powers, and separating Phipsburg from Bath and from West Bath except for a neck 200 rods"], [453, "PHIPSBURG. 445 in width, the Winnegance Carrying Place. South of this we have the Western Basin, Horse Island Harbor and Small Point Harbor. Several others we have no space to mention. There is some salt meadow in the northern part. The insulated ponds are Cornelius, Water Cove, Parker's Head, Rooks and Popham. The surface of the town is rough and ledgy, but without high hills, except the long ridge of Morse's Mountain which rises some 50 feet above the plain. A little south-west of the middle of the town much of the soil is a mixture of clay and sand. The lower part has red loam. The principal crops are potatoes and hay. Near the Basin on the western side is plenty of granite and a good lime quarry. Slate and felspar are also found in town. The depth of water is sufficient for vessels of considerable size to come quite up to the mills on several of the powers. On the Win negance Tide-Power, three miles from Bath post-office, and four miles from Phipsburg Center Village, have been sixteen mills, nine on the Bath side and seven on the Phipsburg side of the line. Some of these, however, were burned several years since. There are now ten saw mills and one grist-mill operating in the town. There is at the Center a ship-yard where vessels of 2,000 tons are built. There are also five ice companies in the town. The post-offices are Phipsburg (Center), Parker's Head, Small Point, Winnegance and Hunnewell's Point. The nearest railroad station is at Bath, about seven miles from Phips burg Center. All steamers on the lines connecting the Kennebec with Portland and Boston, take and discharge passengers at this point. Phipsburg contains the site of the earliest English colony in New England. The peninsula on the eastern side at the southern part, that bears on its north-eastern point the lofty granite walls of Fort Popham, still bears the marks of its occupancy by Popham's colony in 1607. West of the fort rises a long hill running southward, and marking on the shore the western extremity of Hunniwell's Beach. A short dis tance in from the beach, at the foot of a grassy slope on the eastern side of the hill, is a pretty fresh-water pond. At Small Point Harbor, on the south-west side of the town, is the site of a fishing settlement established by the Pejepscot proprietors in 1716, with the name of Augusta. Dr. Oliver Noyes, one of the proprietors, was the principal director and patron. Captain John Penhallow, author of a noted history of the Indian Wars, in 1717, resided here. Dr. Noyes, in 1716, erected here a stone fort 100 feet square, for the purpose of protecting the settlers who were coming in rapidly. A sloop named \"Pejepscot\" was employed as a packet between this Augusta and Boston, carrying out lumber and fish, and bringing back merchandise and settlers. The settlement continued until Lovewell's War, when the houses were burnt and the fort destroyed by the Indians. In 1737 an attempt at re-settlement was made. Among those who came at this time were three families of Halls, Clark, *Wallace, Wyman, James Doughty, David Gustin, Jeremiah Springer, Nicholas Rideout and John Owens. Phipsburg was included in the Pejepscot grant to Purchase and Way, and after Wharton's purchase their lands were confirmed anew to some of the purchasers. The south part of the town was bought of the Indians by Thomas Atkins, the remainder by John Parker, jr., in 1659, and the northern part was assigned to his brother-in-law, Thomas Webber, who also obtained an Indian title. Silvanus Davis, widely known in his day, owned and improved a farm south of Webber's"], [454, "446 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. In 1734 Col. Arthur Noble built a strong garrison on the north side of the peninsula near Fiddler's Reach. The first house of worship known in this settlement was erected near this garrison in 1736. Some thirty five years later an Episcopal church was erected on the site of this first house. The present Congregational church at the Center was built about 1802. The extension of the North Yarmouth Line direct to the ocean brought the southern part of Phipsburg into that town ; but the whole, for convenience to the inhabitants, was, in 1741, annexed to George town. In 1814 Phipsburg was separated from that town and incorporat ed under its present name, which was adopted in honor of Sir William Phips. Eminent names among the citizens of this town in days that are past are Mark L. Hill, Andrew Reed, Parker McCobb, James Bowker, William M. and Thomas M. Reed. The fact that there are some 25 persons above seventy-five years of age speaks well for the salubrity of the climate. Two of the churches in the town belong to the Free Baptists and one to the Congregationalists. Phipsburg has fourteen public schoolhouses, and the total school property is valued at $2,500. The valuation of the estates in 1870 was $427,303. In 1880 it was $371,836. The rate of taxation in 1880 was three and a quarter per cent. The population in 1870 was 1,344. In 1880 it was 1,497.

Penobscot County bounds it on the east and south, Somerset on the west and south, and Aroostook on the north and east. On the western boundary lies Moosehead Lake, and opposite, on the eastern side, are Pemadumcook and Millinoket lakes. This county also constitutes a large part of the most elevated region of Maine, lying on an average upwards of 1200 feet above the sea. Midway of its eastern border rises Katahdin to a height of 5,385 feet above sea level. Several others rise many hundreds of feet above the surrounding region, and to thousands of feet above the sea. The greatest height of land appears to be about midway between Moosehead Lake on the west and Pemadumcook on the east, Chesuncook on the north and Sebec Lake on the south, \u2014 and again in the region of Mount Katahdin and north-west thereof. From these tracts the streams flow off in all directions ; and between them runs the west branch of the Penobscot. There is not known to me any other tract of equal extent with this in the world having so many lakes and ponds. On Pleasant River, in the eastern township of the Bowdoin College grant, and some 20 miles above the Katahdin Iron Mines, is a marvellous glen, through which the little river makes its wild course, \u2014 now leaping down stupendous cataracts, and anon shoot ing between towering walls, \u2014 forming a passage which is the dread of lumbermen, and quite enrapturing to visitors. In Elliotsville, a town ship adjoining Greenville on the south-west, is a natural curiosity which has yet received little attention.

The whole of this county is on the north side of the 45th parallel of north latitude. Frosts come early, the winters are long and snows deep ; yet even in the northern part wheat and the other farm products, excepting corn, ripen abundant crops. When first entered by settlers, this territory was included in Hancock and Kennebec counties, but when (in 1809) Somerset County was incorporated, the western portion, amounting to three tiers of townships, was embraced in this new county. In 1816, Penobscot County was incorporated, and all but the three western tiers of town ships above mentioned were included in that county. In 1838, Pis cataquis County was incorporated, taking four tiers of townships from Penobscot, and three from Somerset county, \u2014 the most western tier being included in the Bingham purchase. It then extended in full width to Canada, but in 1844 its northern portion, embracing about 60 townships, was annexed to Aroostook County. In its present extent it contains more than 100 full townships, with an area of 3,780 square miles. The townships are generally 6 miles square, lying in regular ranges ; the latter was numbered from the north line of the Waldo patent (now constituting a part of the north line of Waldo County) the southern tier in Piscataquis County being the sixth range in this enu meration. In its length north and south, it includes 16 townships, and in its width, 7. Nearly two-thirds of these townships are now covered with forests, and wholly unoccupied, except by the lumber men in their annual pursuit of logs. The county abounds in water-power, slate, granite, limestone; while there are some valuable mineral deposits, \u2014 the chiefest yet known being the Katahdin iron mine. The most important river is the Piscataquis, which gives its name to the county, and upon which the first settlements were made. The pioneer settler of Piscataquis County was Eli Towne, who moved his family from Temple, N. H., into Dover in 1803. Sebec was the first town'incorporated in the county, the act having been passed February 28, 1812. The next was Foxcroft, which was incorporated on Feb ruary 29, 1812. Dover, though the first settled, was not incorporated until 1822. The principal occurrences of wide-spread effect in the county were the cold seasons of 1815 and the following year, when the crops suffered to such an extent as to produce great hardship, \u2014 and the great fires of 1825, which began in August and continued until the middle of October, in which much timber land and quite a number of dwellings were destroyed. The only railroad in the county is the Bangor and Piscataquis railway, chartered from Oldtown to Moosehead Lake. The Piscataquis Observer, is the only paper in the county. It was started in 1838 by George V. Edes as the Piscataquis Herald, but this was changed to the Piscataquis Farmer, from this in 1848 to its present name. The present proprietor is Mr. S. D. Edes, who still maintains its character as an excellent county paper. In the war of the Rebellion, Piscataquis County furnished its full proportion of gallant soldiers who did battle for the Union. Colonel C. S. Douty and Major C. P. Chandler, of oui fallen heroes, were natives of Piscataquis County. The public schoolhouses of the county number 140, \u2014 valued at $44, 200. The valuation in 1870 was 4,845,880 ; in 1880, $3,342,236. The"], [456, "448 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. number of polls at the same date was 3,355.

PisllOll'S Ferry, a post-office, ferry and railroad station on the Kennebec River on the northern line of Fairfield and Clinton. Pittsfield lies in the south-eastern part of Somerset County, 20 miles east of Skowhegan. The Maine Central Railroad passes through the south-eastern part, having a station at East Pittsfield. From the form of this town, it appears to have been what was left after all the towns about it had taken what land they wanted. Yet it has a productive soil of sandy loam, though in a few places. Along the Sebasticook, which runs southward through the eastern part of the town, there are many granite bowlders. The surface in general is very level, but lies principally on a large swell inclining to the east and west. The town is well wooded with all the trees common in the region excejjt pine. The farmers have given much attention to fruit-growing, and consequently there are many fine apple orchards. Sibley Ponds lies on the western border of the town at the north. The streams are small except the Sebasticook, on which at East-Pittston are the prin cipal manufactories. There are here a saw-mill for long and short lumber, a shingle-mill, a woolen-mill, a grain-mill, etc. The Maine Central Institute, near this village, has an elegant Jbuilding, with suitable appointments, and is an excellent and flourishing school. It fits many students for Bates and other colleges. This town was formerly known as Plymouth Gore, and was a part of the Kennebec Purchase. The first settler was Moses Martin, from, Norridgewock, who in 1794, took up his residence at a bend of the Sebasticook about 2 miles below the village. In 1800 came George Brown, of Norridgewock, William Bradford, and a Mr. Wyman from Vassalboro. Messrs. Brown and Wyman built the first mills. In 1804 John Sibley and John Spearing removed hither from Fairfield, settling on the westerly side, east of Sibley's Pond. In 1806, John Merrick, from Hallowell, settled here. Dominicus Getchell removed hither from West Anson in 1811 ; Joseph McCanslin, from Hallowell in 1813, and John Webb from Waterville in 1815. About the same time came Timothy Mclntire and Stephen Kendal, both of whom were prominent. in the affairs of the town in its early period. Pittsfield was organized as the plantation of Sebasticook in 1815; but on account of difficulty in collecting the taxes the organization was abandoned. On June 19, 1819, it was incorporated under the name of Warsaw. The first town meeting under this name was held at John Webb's dwelling, July 19, 1819. Stephen Kendal was elected delegate to a convention to frame a state constitution ; and in the same year the town gave 19 votes \u2014 the whole number\u2014 for the new constitution. In 1824, the name was changed from Warsaw to Pittsfield in honor of William Pitts of Boston, who was then a large proprietor of land here. In 1828, a portion of the \"Ell of Palmyra\" belonging to Joseph Warren of Boston, and con taining 4,200 acres, was annexed to Pittsfield. The town lost 35 men of the number sent into the Union army during the war of Rebellion. There are societies of Free Baptists,"], [457, "PITTSTON. 449 Universalists, Methodists and Christians in the town, and the three first have churches. The number of public schoolhouses is eleven, \u2014 which are valued at $5,000. The population in 1870 was 1,813. In 1880 it was 1,909. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $518,515. In 1880 it was $560,709. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 16 mills on the dollar. PittStOll is the south-easterly town of Kennebec County, lying on the eastern bank of the Kennebec River, 6 miles south by south east of Augusta. It is bounded on the north by Chelsea, east by Whitefield and Alna, south by Dresden, and west by Gardiner. The first settler is supposed to have been Alexander Brown ; who built his house on an interval then known as \" Kerdoormeorp,\" cleared up a lot for tillage, and was employed for several years in procuring sturgeon for the London market. In 1676 he was killed by the Indians and his house burned. In 1716 Dr. Noyes, agent of the Kennebec proprietors, built a fort near Nahumkeag Island, which was also destroyed by the Indians. Captain John North, assisted by Abram Wyman, laid the town out in lots in 1751. Soon after the conquest of Canada a number of persons from Falmouth settled in Pittston. The town was in corporated in 1779, being named in honor of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, the friend of the American colonies. The corporation included Gardiner and West Gardiner until 1804. General Henry- Dearborn was the first representative to the General Court, in 1799. The first list of town officers extant is as follows : clerk, William Wilkins ; selectmen, Seth Saper, Samuel Berry, and Thomas Agry ; treasurer, Samuel Oakman ; constable, Henry Smith. Some of the names of other prominent citizens in the modern period are Eliakim Scammon, Stephen Young, John Jewett, George Williamson, Nicholas Cooper, William Stephens, John Scott, and John Blanchard. The town is somewhat remarkable for the longevity of its inhabitants, there being twenty-two persons in town who are eighty years of age and upwards, several being over ninety. Pittston as at present constituted contains an area of 21,300 miles. It is about seven miles long from north to south, and five miles from east to west. The surface is well diversified with hills and valleys, ponds and streams. Beech Hill, estimated from 500 to 600 feet above tide water is the highest eminence. The \"Pebble Hills\" on the \" Haley Farm \" in the south-western part of the town, consist entirely of small pebbles drifted into eminences ; and although excavations have been made to the depth of about 80 feet, nothing else has been found. The usual forest trees flourish ; but when the town was first settled, a large proportion of the timber was of white oak. The soil is a clay loam, and yields good crops of hay and potatoes. Nahumkeag Pond, situated near the centre of the town, has an area of about 400 acres ; Joy's Pond, at the north-eastern corner, has an area of about 100 acres. The Togus stream passes through th(\u00bb north-western part of the town to the Kennebec. On this stream, near the river, on a substantial stone dam, is a saw-mill capable of turning out 500,000 feet of long lumber, 1,000,000 shingles, and clapboards and laths in proportion. The Eastern River, having its principal reservoir in Joy's Pond, runs south ward through almost the entire eastern part of the town ; furnishing at East Pittston the power for a saw-mill and a grist-mill. 29"], [458, "450 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. The principal village \u2014 which bears the name of the town \u2014 is beauti fully located on the Kennebec ; having a connection with Gardiner and the Maine Central railway by means of an excellent wooden bridge 899 feet long. Aside from agriculture, the principal business is connected with ice. Along the Kennebec River are numerous houses for the storage of this product, nearly a dozen different companies and firms carrying on the business in town. The Congregationalists and Methodists have one or more churches each in the town. At East Pittston there is an excellent local academy. In addition Pittston has seventeen public schoolhouses, valued at $7,500. The valuation in 1870 was $648,353 ; in 1880 it was $669,688. The rate of taxation in 1880 was nineteen mills on the dollar. In 1870, the population numbered 2,353 ; which, according to the census of 1880, has increased to 2,457. Plantation of Carrying\" Place, in Somerset County, lies west of the Kennebec, between that river and the southward bend of Dead River. It is a noted carrying-place on the route to or from Canada, by which the passage of Dead and Kennebec rivers is shortened. Three of the ponds in the township lie in the line of the carry and reduce the land travel. The place has been made famous by the passage of Arnold's expedition against Canada over this route in 1775. It is 40 miles from Skowhegan, on the Canada road and stage road from Skowhegan to Quebec. In th^ north-east and south west are high hills. The western range is called \" Carrying Place Mountains.\" Granite is found on Carrying Pond Stream in the south ern part of the township. The soil is a deep, dark loam. Hay- and oats are the chief crops. The business is farming and lumbering. Gold is found in small quantities in Pierce Pond Stream in the north ern part of the township. The nearest post-office is Carratunk Planta tion. Carrying Place Plantation sustains a public school in summer and winter. The Plantation was organized in 1871. It sent 12 men to the aid of the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion. It was formerly No. 1, Range 3, west of Kennebec River. The valuation of estates at the date of organization was $15,000. In 1880 it was $9,980. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2 per cent. The population in 1880 was given in the preliminary report of the census with that of the plantations of Pleasant Ridge, Forks and Moxie, \u2014 altogether 981.

JL lymOUtll lies at the south-western angle of Penobscot County, 20 miles west of Bangor. It is bounded on the north by Newport, east by Etna, south by Dixmont, and by Troy in Waldo County, and west by Detroit in Somerset County. The space south west of the centre of the town is pretty much occupied by Plymouth and Little ponds, which also receives the waters of a pond in Dixmont, and discharge through Martin Stream into the Sebasticook in the north west part of the town. On this stream are five powers, all improved except one. The principal falls are at Plymouth Village, near the centre of the town. The manufactures consist of cloth, lumber, furniture, carriages, fumigators, leather, etc. The basin of the ponds which supply these powers is about one half covered by forest. The area of the reservoirs is at present some 1,800 acres. The height of dams might easily be so increased that from this storage the gross power of the series of falls, at 15 feet each, would be 486 horse-power, or 19,440 spindles for 10 hours a day, 312 days in the year. The storage could be used in six months or less, and the natural run would suffice for the rest of the year, doubling or trebling the power. As it is, the stream is very uniform on account of reservoirs. The stream at the falls runs over compact ledges. Plymouth was incorporated in 1826. It has Baptist and Methodist churches. There are eight or ten stores and two hotels. The number of public schoolhouses is nine ; and the school property is valued at $3,600. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $188i350. In 1880 it was $183,193. The population in 1870 was 941. In 1880 it was 828. PlymOUtll Company. See article on Kennebec County. Poland is the south-west town of Androscoggin County. It is 10 miles from Lewiston and 35 from Portland, with both of which places it is connected by the Grand Trunk Railroad, which passes across the north-eastern portion of the town. The territory of Poland is nearly square, its angles marking the points of the compass. It is bounded on the north-east by Minot and Auburn from which it is separated by the little Androscoggin River, on the south-east by New Gloucester and Auburn, on the south-west by Casco and Raymond, and on the north-west by Otisfield and Oxford. It contains 26,000 acres of land, about two-thirds of which is improved. There are six considerable ponds wholly within its limits and another in part.

The principal business of the town is at Mechanic Falls. Poland Corner, at the centre of the town, has steam, grist, saw and planing mills, and considerable neighborhood trade. There is a lumber-mill and sash and blind factory at Page's Mill on the river above Mechanic Falls, and lumber-mills at Hacket's Mills and Minot Post-Office below, and at West Poland. At the southern angle of the"], [461, "POLAND. 453 town the Shakers have a power used for several small manufactures. East Poland has a post-office and railway station, and West and South Poland and Shaker Village have each a post-office. The most important manufactures at Mechanic Falls are paper, and the repeating rifles of the Evans Rifle Company, and a canning factory. The Dennison Paper Manufacturing Company operates five different mills at this place, pro ducing various kinds of paper, and employing about 150 persons. The surface of the town is in the eastern part level or gentle undulating, while m the western portion there is a combination of hill, lake and forest scenery that is very pleasing, and in some parts highly picturesque. The ledges that crop out along the hillsides show a coarse granite structure with a predominant e of felspar in some localities. Mica schist and argillaceous rock are found in other quarters. The soil in the lowlands and valleys is alluvial, having a surface stratum of vegetable origin underlaid by sand. Poland is one of our best agricul tural towns, all the usual crops having a good yield. The town, however, is most noted for its mineral springs. Thero are the Poland and South Poland and. the Highland springs, the two latter just coming into notice. All are situated at an elevation which affords fine views of the surrounding country, and are recom mended for some diseases of the kidneys and associate derangements. The Poland spring, known in the region as Ricker's, is owned by Hiram Ricker and sons, in whose family the property has been since 1794. Wentworth Ricker opened the Mansion House in 1797 and it has been kept as a hotel by his son and then by his grandsons ever since. Little attention was given to the spring until about 1858 ; when the valuable qualities of the water becoming generally known, th.e hotel (whose business had fallen off with the change from 6tages to railroads) soon had to be enlarged. So popular have the waters of this spring become, that a few years ago it was found advisable to build another and larger house for the accommodation of the patrons who flocked thither in the summer months. The new house bears the name of the Poland Springs House, and contains 120 sleeping rooms, and has 450 feet of broad piazza. The situation on the top of a high, extended hill, or ridge, 800 feet above tho ocean, with ponds, forests and other hills on every side, is one of rare attraction. The spring runs about eight gallons a minute from a crevice in the solid granite ledge. Besides Ricker's Hill may be mentioned Pigeon, Harris, Johnson's, Megqmer, White Oak, Bailey, Thurlow and Black Cat hills, all considerable eminences. The two neighboring Shaker villages, called the Upper Shaker Village, in the town about one half mile south, and another called the Lower Village in New Gloucester, about a mile south of the last, are objects of interest to visitors. The sect in this town originated in 1784 t>r 1785 by the preaching of an itinerant disciple of Ann Lee, from Lebanon, \"New York. There were at this time quite a number of set tlers on Ricker Hill, and most of them became converted. They were joined by others from Hebron ; but exchanged their lands, and settled together in New Gloucester, forming what is now called the Lower Family,and holdingtheirproperty in common. The Upper Family,orthe present Poland community, came from Gorham, Maine, in 1819. They then numbered about 50, but now less than 40. They brought with them eight oxen, three horses and twenty cows, with a variety of house hold goods and farming utensils. They have since further increased"], [462, "454 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. their lands by purchase. They have now in addition to the dwelling houses they have occupied for a half century, a new store-house three or more stories in height. It contains one or two large central halls, together with a large number of lodging and living rooms. It was begun twelve years ago, and when finished will have cost about $20,000. Beside this, they have land and other property to the value of about $30,000. The earliest settlers were Nathaniel Bailey, Daniel Lane, Moses Emery, and John Newman, who settled at what has long been known as \"The Empire\" in 1768-1769. The Pulsifer family is a leading one of the town, having located here in the person of their ancestor, David Pulsifer, in 1790. The family has furnished several esteemed public men. John Nevins, who claimed to have cut the first tree felled in Poland, died in 1832, being above 100 years of age ; other names are Josiah Dunn, \" Captain \" Davis, John Rollins, \" Captain \" Farring ton, Henry Bray, Benjamin Coombs and Mrs. Woodard. The land titles are from the proprietors of Bakerton (see Auburn). The town is thought to have been named for Poland, a noted Indian chief of the region. It was incorporated in 1795. A portion was set off to Danville in 1852. The total amount paid out by the town for its expenses in the war of the Rebellion is $45,230, and the total number of men for which it received credit, 304. The religious societies of the town are the Congregationalists, Uni versalists, Free Baptists, and Adventists. Poland has twenty-two public schoolhouses, valued at $16,775. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $765,960. The population at the same date was 2,436. In 1880, it was 2,443. The valuation in 1880 was $920,057.

It is 75 miles north by north-west of Houlton, via Ashland. It is on the stage-line from the latter town to Fort Kent. This plantation was organized in 1872 ; receiving its name from the sheet of water that occupies a large portion of the centre of the town. The \" portage \" is between this and Lake Machias, in Nashville Plantation. A tract on the western side of the northern portion of this lake was granted to the Maine Female Seminary, and a tract further southward to the Somerset Academy. The population is principally along the eastern 6ide of the lake. The plantation has one schoolhouse, and the school property is valued at $500. The population in 1870 was 124. In 1880 it was 132. The valuation in 1880 was $23,018. P01*t Clyde, a post-office in St. George, Knox County. Porter is the south-western town of Oxford County.

It is 6 miles in length by 4\u00a3 in width, having an area of 18,500 acres. The Great Ossipee River forms the boundary line on the south, while on the southern half of the eastern line lies a chain of ponds, of which Stanley's, the largest, is about one mile in length. Spectacle Pond, nearly the same size, lies in the south-eastern part ; Long Pond, of equal area, lies in the south-west, and Colcord Pond, the largest (area, about a square mile), lies near the centre of the town, with Bickford Pond about a mile to the south-west. In the north-eastern part are several high elevations, bearing the names of Bald Ledge, Devil's Den, Pine Hill,\" Burnt Meadow Mountain, and Mount Eagle. The surface is generally uneven, but the hillsides afford excellent pasturage, and many cattle are raised. The town has also long been noted for its orchards. Originally, it was thickly wooded with pine, and white and red oak. At the south-eastern corner of the town is Kezar Falls vil lage ; and on the Ossipee, at the mouth of the outlet of Colcord and Bickford Ponds, is Porter Village. The outlets of the various ponds afford several good water-powers. Colcord Pond has a saw-mill and grist-mill at its outlet ; Bickford Pond has a saw-mill ; a mile below is another, and Porter Village has a third saw-mill. At the latter place are also furniture and bobbin factories. At Kezar Falls are three saw mills, a spool-factory, and a boot and shoe factory. This town is 50 miles south-west of Paris. It is 35 miles from Portland, on the stage line to Freedom, N. H., and terminus of the line to Wakefield, N. H., on the Great Falls and Concord Railroad. The township which is now Porter was purchased of Massachu setts, in September, 1795, by Dr. Aaron Porter, of Biddeford, Caleb Emery, of Sanford, Thomas Cutts, of Pepperellborough (now Saco) and others, for the sum of \u00a3564 lawful money. It was also provided in the grant, that they should appropriate 320 acres for schools, the same number for the first-settled minister, and a similar lot for the support of the ministry ; also 100 acres to each man who should settle in the township before the 1st day of January, 1784. This condition was met by the following settlers : Mesheck and Stephen Libby, from Rye, N. H., John Libby and James Rankins. These were all until 1787, when Benjamin Bickford, Jr., Samuel Bickford, from Rochester, N. H., and Benjamin Ellenwood, from Groton, became settlers. About 1791, David Allord, Joseph Clark, and Moses Drown, from Rochester, N. H., became permanent residents. Most of these were soldiers of the Revolution. The territory of Porter was ? part of the Pequaket territory, and extended quite to Fryeburg; but at its incorporation, Feb. 20,1807, about two-fifths of its northerly portion was annexed to Brownfield. Kezar Falls has a Free Baptist and a Methodist church, and Porter Village, a Union church. The number of public schoolhouses is 13 ; their value with lots, being placed at $2,500. The population in 1870 was 1,104. In 1880 it was 1,095. The valuation in 1870 was $275,469. In 1880 it was $279,359. Portland, eminent for its business facilities, for the health. fulness and beauty of its situation, and for the enterprise and urbanity of its citizens, occupies the chief harbor oil Casco Bay, in the southern"], [465, "MAINE GENERAL HOSPITAL, PORTLAND"], [466, "458 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. \"part of Cumberland County. Being the nearest port on the Atlantic coast to the cities of the St. Lawrence, and having a harbor safe and convenient for the largest ocean-steamers, and open at all seasons, it has naturally become the chief seaport of the Canadas, as well as of Western Maine, and the northern parts of New Hampshire and Ver mont. From the city proceed the Boston and Maine, the Eastern and the Portland and Rochester railways, traversing New Hampshire and Massachusetts business centres, and connecting with the roads to all parts of the continent. The Grand Trunk of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad comes down through the northern parts of Ver mont and New Hampshire to the wharves of the ocean steamships in Portland Harbor. The Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad, passing up the valley of the Saco, threading the White Mountains, by way of St. Johnsbury, Vt., and thence to the foot of Lake Cham plain, will afford a still shorter route to Canada and the great West. The Maine Central with its branches, connects with the central region of the State from the Penobscot almost to the Rangely Lakes ; at Bangor it con nects with the Piscataquis Railroad, and by the European and North American Railway, with the systems of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. All these lines are connected in the city by the marginal rail way. In addition to the railroad facilities, lines of steamboats give water-carriage tri-weekly to New York, daily to Boston, tri-weekly to Bangor and intermediate ports, weekly to Mount Desert and Machias, semi-weekly to Eastport and St. John, N. B., and semi-weekly to Hali fax, N. S., direct. The Allan line of steamships ply weekly between Portland and Liverpool, from November to May, affording large facil ities of import and export. Most of the leading manufactures are produced in the city or in its vicinity, \u2014 many of them in large quantities and of superior ex cellence. The average amount of duties collected at the Portland Custom House for some years past is not far from $900,000. The special industries in which Portland excels all other cities, are probably those of hermetically sealed provisions and the fisheries, and the preservation of fish in various forms. In the fish business, about a dozen firms are engaged in the packing of mackerel and herring. These firms during the season of 1880, packed a total of 80,500 barrels of mackerel and 13,300 barrels of her ring. The market-value of these is little short of $500,000. The num ber of vessels engaged in the mackerel fishery is 162 ; in the herring fishery, 75 ; making a total of 237 vessels, whose crews number 3,345. This does not include the persons employed in packing the fish. Half a dozen more firms are engaged in the curing of cod and other fish. The three which do the largest business in these, cured in the season ending with the middle of October, 1880, 50,000 quintals. The curing is done on the islands in the harbor. House Island has been in use for this purpose for more than 200 years. Portland is the smallest town in the State in superficial area. A 6mall peninsula jutting into the inner waters of Casco Bay, and 16 islands and parts of islands, lying at distances of from 3 to 10 miles down the bay constitute the territory of the city. This peninsula, or Neck, was called Isachigonne by the Indians, which according to some means bad clay ; while others contend that its interpretation should be"], [467, "PORTLAND. 459 knee or elbow, \u2014 descriptive of the curving form of the peninsula. The names of the islands are Peak's, Long, Cushing's, House, Great and Little Diamond (or Hog), part of Crotch, part of Hope, Little Chebea gue, Jewell's, Cow, Rain, Marsh, Overset, Crow, and Pumpkin Knob. Several of these islands are very picturesque and attractive, and 4 or 5 have hotels. The peninsula is about 3 miles long, with an average breadth of three-fourths of a mile. On the southerly side lies Cape Elizabeth, separated from Portland by an arm of the sea called Fore River, which constitutes the inner harbor. On the northerly side, is Back Cove ; and beyond is Deering. The peninsula has a mean elevation at the middle of more than 100 feet, \u2014 sloping gradually to the water on either side, except at the eastern and western extremities, \u2014 which rise in Munjoy's Hill at the east to the height of 161 feet ; and at the west, in Bram hall's Hill, to 175 feet, \u2014 ending here in a bold bluff. Munjoy's Hill affords delightful views of the waters of Casco Bay and its numerous islands, and of the ocean beyond. Bramhall commands a sea view, and a broad landscape of farm, forest and village, and beyond all, the great semicircle of the mountains. This configuration of the peninsula gives excellent drainage, while from its altitude it is bathed in the pure breezes from sea and shore, rendering it one of the most healthy cities on the globe. From end to end of the peninsula runs Congress street, the backbone of the city, 3 miles in length. Parallel with this on the east for a part of its length, are, first, Middle street, devoted chiefly to the dry goods trade ; second, Fore street, miscellaneous trade ; and third, Commercial street, fronting the harbor, and occupied largely by wholesale traders in heavy goods of all sorts. On the western side, the streets are Cumberland ; second, Oxford and Portland ; third, Lincoln and Kennebec, \u2014 the last two running along the margin of Back Cove. The whole peninsula has above 226 streets, lanes and courts, aggregat ing a length of 48 miles ; while 29 wharves extend into the harbor, af fording accommodation to vessels of every size and kind. Besides the lines of steam railways, already enumerated, there are 6 avenues for teams and foot passengers. There is also projected and partly built, a Marginal Way, 100 feet in width, running entirely around the city. Horse cars furnish easy transit between the depots of the different lines of steam cars, and the principal streets ; connecting also with the suburban villages of Deering Point, Woodford's Corner, and Morrill's Corner. The business of the city centres on the southerly slope below Congress street, near the middle of the peninsula. Munjoy's Hill is almost a village by itself of middle class residences, having its own churches, schools and shops. The northerly slope, back of Congress street, along its whole length, is devoted to private residences. The western end, rising gradually to the eminence of Bramhall, is the fash ionable quarter ; and, having been spared by the great fire of 1866, now contains the oldest mansions, as well as many new and elegant edifices. A marked feature of Bramhall is the well-kept gardens and lawn surrounding the houses, and generally open to public view through open fences, or over low hedges, or guards of stone. The slope under Bramhall toward Deering's Oaks, is now, also, becoming an inhabited place, and many handsome residences are already erected. Portland has several excellent hotels, \u2014 the Falmouth, situated on Middle street, being the largest. It is a magnificent structure containing"], [468, "460 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 240 rooms, and 10 large stores. Its front is of Albert-stone, and its side walls oi pressed brick, with Albert-stone trimmings. The building of the first National Bank, near by, is a fine building of red-sandstone. A little farther down is the fine granite front of the Casco Bank building. The Maine Savings Bank has its rooms on the corner of Plum street. Over it is the St. Julian Hotel, a neat little house conducted on the European plan. A short distance beyond is the handsome red-freestone building of the Canal Bank. The oldest of the public houses of the city, recently enlarged and brought up to the requirement of the times, is the United States Hotel, on the eastern side of Market square, and occupying the space between Federal and Congress streets. In Stanton Block, on Exchange street, the Board of Trade has its head-quarters ; and here, also, is the Merchants' Exchange, with its reading-room. Close by is POKTLAyn n-BSERVATOKY. the elegant building of the Merchants' Bank. On the comer of Middle and Exchange streets is the Post-Office, an elegant building of Vermont marble, occupying a square by itself. Among its red brick neighbors, its chaste white walls and elegant architecture give it a somewhat ethereal look. Its cost was half a million of dollars. In the second story is the United States Court room and offices. A little further up on the same street, is the fine block of the Portland Saving's Bank, \u2014 then the Printer's Exchange, where several papers are issued. On Congress street, at the head of Exchange, is the City Government"], [469, "PORTLAND. 461 Building, an imposing structure, having a frontage of 150 feet, a length of 221 feet, with corner towers 75 feet high, and a central dome that Bwells upward 160 feet. Its front is of a light-colored Nova Scotia Albert-stone, and the sides and rear of pressed brick with Albert-stone trimmings. Its cost was $650,000. In it, besides city and county rooms and offices, are the Public Library, containing 26,000 volumes, and the library of the Maine Historical Society. There are also two excellent halls in the building, the largest of which, an elegant apart ment, will conveniently seat 2,500 people. At the foot of Hancock street on the corner of Fore street, stands \" the old square wooden house upon the edge of the sea,\" in which the poet Longfellow was born. Turning to Commercial street, a short walk brings us to the Custom house, a handsome structure of granite, \u2014which also has a front on Fore street. On the opposite side of Com mercial street, not far away, is the extensive and massive \"Thomas Block,\" built by Hon. William W Thomas, one of the oldest and most successful merchants of Portland, \u2014 who has added beauty and value to the city by the erection of many elegant buildings. The site of the first settlement in Portland is now occupied by the depot, the immense elevator, and other buildings of the Grand Trunk Railway. The settlers were George Cleeves and Richard Tucker, \u2014 who here built their house, cleared land, and planted the first corn \u2014 in 1632. They were squatters at first; but in 1637, Cleeves went to England and obtained from Sir Ferdinand Gorges, proprietor of this region, a grant of the peninsula on which they had built, and other neighboring lands and islands. These he parcelled out to settlers, and a small community soon grew up, and became known as Casco. Fish ing, cultivation of the soil, and trade with the Indians, formed the business. In 1658, Massachusetts usurped the government of Gorges' territory, and applied the name Falmouth to Casco Neck, and a wide extent of territory about this harbor ; but the peninsula continued to be called Casco Neck until its incorporation as Portland in 1786. Falmouth at first embraced, in addition to the Neck, the territory now belonging to the towns of Cape Elizabeth, Deering, Westbrook and the present Falmouth. With incorporation came the settlement of a minister, and the people built the first meeting-house on the point now occupied by the Portland Company's works. The first minister was Rev. George Burroughs, a graduate of Harvard University, who began to preach there in 1674. When the town was destroye d by the Indians in 1690, he went toDanvers; and two years afterward he was executed at Salem as a wizard. When the savages fell upon the place in 1676, of the 40 families in town, only four or five lived upon the Neck. In 1678 old settlers returned ; and Fort Loyal, the largest fortification on the coast, was erected on a rocky eminence where the round-house of the Grand Trunk Railway now stands. A party of Huguenots, or French Protestants, came in as settlers about this time. The town now began to prosper, \u2014 mills were set up, and roads were laid out, \u2014 mere foot paths, however, as no vehicles had yet been introduced. In 1681, the first tavern was opened. In 1688, the population of Falmouth had in creased to 600 or 700, comprising 80 families, 25 of whom were on the Neck. In 1689, during the second Indian war, a large body of their warriors approached the town. Major Church, arriving with two com panies just at the nick of time, met the Indians in the valley on the"], [470, "462 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. north side of Bramhall's Hill, and, after a sharp fight, drove them off ; losing in the contest eleven killed and ten wounded. The next year, 500 French and Indians, after a siege of five days, captured the fort, and carried the garrison captive to Canada. From this time until after the close of Queen Anne's war in 1713, the place remained \" deserted Casco.\" With its settlement in 1715, begins the second period of its history, which ends with its destruction by Mowatt in 1775. The new settlement was on nearly the same site as the old. In 1727, Rev. Thomas Smith commenced in the place his long ministry of over sixty-eight years. In the course of half a century a great trade with the West Indies, as well as with England, sprang up ; so that on Nov. 1, 1766, six large ships were lying in the harbor. At the commencement of the Revolu tion, 2,555 tons of shipping were owned in what is now Portland : and the population was about 2,000. Its patriotism was then as prompt as has ever since been. No vantage was allowed for the enforce ment of the Stamp Act ; the hated stamps being seized and burned as soon as they arrived ; and when the tax was placed upon tea, a popular assemblage resolved \" that we will not buy nor sell any India tea what ever; \" and when the British government closed the port of Boston in 1774, the bell of Falmouth meeting-house was muffled and tolled from sunrise to sunset. Incensed by his capture and detention here in the previous spring by a party of militia from Brunswick, Capt. Henry Mowatt, in October, 1775, entered the harbor with a fleet of five war vessels, and on the 18th of that month, laid the town in ashes. The citizens nobly refused to give up their arms to secure the immunity of their village, but mostly fled into the country, taking with them what they could carry of their goods. Out of 514 buildings, only 100 dwell ing-houses were left standing. Thus for the third time, the town was desolated. With the acknowledgment of our independence as a nation, a period of prosperity again began. There were not only business but social changes. \"Distinctions of rank and of dress,\" says Elwell, \"gave way before the democratic spirit of the times ; cocked hats, bush wigs, and breeches passed out, and pantaloons came in. Capt. Joseph Titcomb created quite a sensation when he returned home from the South, in 1790, wearing the latter form of the nether garment, the first seen here.\" In 1785, the first brick house in town was commenced, and the first newspaper appeared, the \"Falmouth Gazette,\" published by Benjamin Titcomb and Thomas B. Waite. The same author pre viously quoted says, \" In 1786, the town was divided, and the Neck, with the name of Portland, started on an independent career, with a population of about 2,000. In 1793, wharves were extended into the harbor. In 1795, Nathaniel Deering built the first brick store. In 1799, the first bank was incorporated. Trade advanced westward from the old site at the foot of India street, and in 1800, Exchange (then called Fish) street was the principal seat of business.\" Then the wealthier merchants began to build them more stately residences, fitted to the increasing refinement and the more lavish expenditure. Such are the Matthew Cobb house, still standing at the corner of High and Free streets ; the mansion built by Ebenezer Storer, on the corner of High and Danforth street ; that built by Joseph H. Ingraham, on State street ; and the fine old mansion on the corner of High and Spring streets, long the residence of the late General Wingate ; all"], [471, "PORTLAND. 463 giving evidence of the architectural taste and thorough workmanship of the olden time. on JhC non-intercourse policy adopted by the general government in 1806, and the embargo which followed in 1807, brought a disastrous and sudden check to all this prosperity. \" Navigation fell off 9,000 tons in two years; and all the various classes to whom it gave support were thrown out of employment ; eleven commercial houses stopped payment in 1807, and many others the following year. * * * In the war of 1812, which followed, our sea-faring people manned the priva teers fitted out here, some of which ran a successful career, and did CITY HALL, PORTLAND. great damage to the enemy, while others were soon captured by supe rior force, and their crews held as prisoners.\" The fourth period in the history of Portland begins with the peace of 1815, and continues to the commencement of the railroad era in 1846. This was a period of slow recovery from the disasters of tl e war. In March 1820, the district of Maine was separated from Mass achusetts and admitted into the Union as a State, and Portland became its capital. In 1823, the first steamer ever brought to Maine arrived in the harbor. This was the Patent, a vessel of about 100 tons burthen, owned by Capt. Seward Porter, of this city, who had bought her in New York to run as a passenger-boat between Boston and Portland."], [472, "464 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Both Jonathan Morgan and Captain Porter had previously experi mented with steamboats of their own construction ; the Kennebec, built by the latter in 1822, having been the first to run in Casco Bay. In 1833, the steamer Chancellor Livingston, built under the direction of Robert Fulton, ran between Portland and Boston ; and the Cumber land Steam Navigation Company, formed in the same year, put the steamer Commodore McDonough on the route in opposition. The Cumberland and Oxford Canal connecting the waters of Lake Sebago with Portland Harbor, was begun in 1828, completed in 1830, at a cost of $206,000. This helped the business of the town somewhat ; yet the steamboats and the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroad, opened in 1842, took much Portland business to Boston. A new railroad con necting with Boston diverted also to that city the trade of northern Vermont, which had previously come through the north of the White Mountains to Portland. The fifth period commenced with the opening of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad to Canada, in 1853. To aid in its construction, Portland loaned its credit in bonds to the amount of $2,000,000. This Grand Trunk road brought the city in connection not only with the cities of Canada, but with the vast grain growing regions of the West. Then came, as necessary adjuncts of the road, a winter line of steamers to Liverpool, and the construction of a new business avenue along the whole water front of the city, a mile long and 100 feet wide, running over tide water, across the heads of wharves. This is Commercial street, the scene of a large wholesale trade in flour, grain and groceries. Then came the building of the system of railroads, now consolidated under the name of the Maine Central, opening to the trade of Portland all parts of the State, and the Lower Provinces of Canada. Then Brown's Sugar House and the Portland Company's Works, and other manufacturing establishments sprang np, giving employment to hundreds of people. The financial panic of 1857-8 brought no serious disaster to the business of the city; and trade had again attained to a flourishing con dition, when the war of the Slaveholder's Rebellion broke out. Port land, as usual, was prompt to the demands of patriotism, \u2014 six companies of the First Maine regiment, Colonel Jackson, having been raised here. Later regiments organized in Portland were the 5th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th, 17th, and 25th. The latter was a nine-months regiment of Port land boys, led by Col. Francis Fessenden. In all, Portland contributed to the army and navy of the Union during the war, 5,000 men to whom she paid a bounty of $428,970. Of these, 421 lost their lives in battle, or by disease. Her citizens also contributed largely in aid of the san itary and Christian commissions, and many of her noble women gave their services in nursing the sick and wounded. One morning in June, 1863, the United States Revenue cutter Caleb Cushing, was missed from her moorings, and Revenue Collector Jewett and Major McLellan, promptly manning and arming the steamers Forest City and Chesapeake, found her in the hands of the rebels, becalmed near Green Islands. On discovering the approaching vessels, her captors set her on fire, and took to their boats. She presently blew up; and the rebel crew were soon captured by the pursuing steamers, and lodged in Fort Preble, as prisoners of war. During the war, much shipping of Portland had been transferred to the British flag ; but the business of the city did not otherwise suffer much loss."], [473, "PORTLAND. 465 On the 4th of July, 1866, a carelessly thrown cracker set fire to a boat-builder's shop on Commercial street, whence the flames were soon communicated to Brown's Sugar House; whence it swept on diago nally through the city, spreading like a fan as it went. Entire streets were swept away, including massive warehouses, lofty churches, splen did mansions, ancestral houses and the dwellings of the poor, in the oldest and most crowded parts of the city in one common ruin. For nearly half a day, and through the night until the small hours of the morning, the vast volumes of flame and smoke held sway, sending ter ror and anguish among the whole population. The fire ended near Munjoy's Hill. The morning saw fifteen hundred buildings laid in ashes ; fifty-eight streets and courts reduced to a wilderness of chim neys, amid which the most familiar inhabitant lost himself ; ten thou- CTT8TOM HOUSE, PORTLAND. sand people made homeless, and ten millions of property destroyed. Villages of tents and barracks sprang up on Munjoy, and generous contributions from abroad flowed in, providing food, shelter and cloth ing for the penniless. In rebuilding, old streets were widened and straightened, and new ones opened ; and, after a lapse of ten years, the waste places were almost wholly rebuilt, far more roomy, convenient and handsome than before. Meantime the increase of the business facilities of the city went on. In 1873, the Boston and Maine Railroad was extended from South Berwick to Portland, taking on its way Old Orchard Beach. In 1875, the Portland and Rochester Railroad completed its connections 30"], [474, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 466 with Nashua, N. H., and Worcester, Mass. The same year, the Port land and Ogdensburg Railroad was completed through the Notch of the White \"Mountains. In the same period, various manufactures sprang up within the city or in its vicinity, as the rolling of railroad iron, the making of carriages, shoes, matches, stoneware, and drain pipes ; and these products find a market all over the United States, and, to some extent, in foreign countries. In 1875, Lake Sebago water was introduced by aqueduct all through the city, and the sewerage ren dered more complete. Broad and regular streets, handsome and sub stantial business blocks, elegant and commodious dwellings, good drain age well-lighted streets, pure water, excellent air, convenient convey ance in and out of the city, by horse and steam cars, \u2014 numerous shade trees, unsurpassed views of sea and shore, good schools, well-attended churches, and a moral, industrious, enterprising and courteous people \u2014 these render Portland one of the most desirable of cities for a home and business. There are now living in the city a large number of per sons over eighty years of age. Among those who have contributed largely to make Portland what it is in these various respects, must be mentioned the following names : George Cleeves, a first settler and proprietor, and Rev. Thomas Smith, the first have already been mentioned. Not only was Mr. Smith for a long period, the only minister, but also the only physician in town. Another distinguished citizen of the anti-Revolutionary period was General Jedediah Preble, who had served in the French wars, and at the breaking out of the Revolution, was prevented from being the principal military officer of Massachusetts only by the infirmities of years. Worthy of honorable mention, also, are Theophilus Bradbury and David Wyer, earliest members of Cumberland bar. Samuel Freeman, school-teacher, trader, and Revolutionary patriot, a deacon of the First Parish forty-five years, delegate to the Provincial Con gress, Judge of Probate forty-five years, post-master twenty-eight years, president of the Maine Bank and president of Bowdoin College for a number of years, with other offices ; also the publisher of several law-books. About 1770, Theophilus Parsons, afterwards Chief Justice of Massachusetts, became a citizen, studied law, and was admitted to the Cumberland bar. Sheriff William Tyng, most prominent of the Maine Tories, was also a citizen of this town. A little later was Simon Greenleaf, distinguished as a member of the Cumberland bar, a learned jurist and writer on law ; Stephen Longfellow, father of the poet, long in the successful practice,of the law in the Cumberland courts ; Pren tiss Mellen, chief justice of the State ; Ezekiel Whitman, member of Congress for four terms, and chief justice of the Supreme Court of Maine; Samuel Fessenden, the able lawyer, orator and philanthropist; Albion K. Parris, Governor of the State at the age of thirty-three years, and long in successful practice here; William Pitt Preble, a judge and Minister to the Netherlands ; Arthur Ware, a learned writer on Maritime law, and judge of the United States District Court for forty-four years; Ether Shepley, long chief justice of the State; George F. Shepley, son of Ether, a brave soldier, and later, judge of the United States Circuit Court, who died a few years after his father. Of orators and statesmen of national reputation, Sargent S. Prentiss \u2014 though he won his reputation in the south \u2014 was born here; and Wil liam Pitt Fessenden, the distinguished U. S. senator and secretary of"], [475, "PORTLAND. 467 the Treasury, was always a citizen of this town. Hon. George Evans, another U.

There are also as many as twenty-five societies more or less benevolent in their objects, besides several others of an intellectual and social nature. Portland has six National Banks, with an aggregate capital of $3,150,000. They are the First National Bank, and Casco National Bank, each with a capital of $800,000 ; Canal National Bank, having a capital of $600,000 ; Merchants' National Bank and National Traders Bank, each having a capital of $300,000 ; and the Cumberland National Bank, with a capital of $250,000.

Portland has three daily papers, all well sustained. The Argus \u2014 ancient and respectable, and always fresh, bright, readable and democratic ; the Press, a reliable Republican sheet, always elegant and honorable ; the Advertiser, the oldest daily paper in the city, but at present, the most concise ; Republican in politics, but independent in its views. The Portland Sunday Times, is a lively secular weekly, devoted largely to social matters. It is independent in politics. The New Era Leader, and the Sunday Leader, are spirited journals, Green back in politics, but generally independent in their views. Zion's Advocate, an organ of the Baptists, is an excellent denominational paper. The Christian Mirror, the organ of the Congregationalists in Maine, is ably edited, and wholly worthy of its patronage. The Port land Transcript, known to every Maine family, is unsurpassed in its field by any newspaper in the country. The North-East, published monthly, is the organ of the Episcopal church in Maine. The Masonic Token, issued quarterly, by Stephen Berry, is devoted to masonry, and would consequently be very useful to every member of that order. The Helping Hand, a monthly, published by the Young Men's Chris tian Association, is well adapted to a worthy purpose. Our Home and Fireside Magazine, published monthly and Saturday by H. Hal lett & Co., is devoted almost wholly to stories. The People's Illus trated Journal and The Illustrated Household Magazine, published monthly, by Geo. Stinson & Co., are of the same class and of equal rank. The Globe, published every Saturday, is devoted to local news. The Portland Price Current, issued every Saturday, by M. N. Rich, is a sine qua non to the merchants of the city and its neighborhood. The City Item is a lively little daily, devoted to news. It is published by A. W. Laughlin. The Floral Monthly, issued by W. E. Morton & Co., is a very desirable publication to all cultivators of flowers. In her public schools, Portland takes much pride; for with them she has not hesitated at the expense of the best instructions and super vision whick could be obtained. They are very carefully graded, and the standard of scholarship is high. The schoolhouses are generally not only handsome buildings, but their internal arrangement is well-"], [477, "PRENTISS. 469 planned for the health and comfort of the occupants. The number of schoolhouses belonging to the city is fourteen ; and the value of school property is $413,025. The value of estates in 1870 was $29,439, 257. In 1880 it was $30,437,541. The rate of taxation in the latter year, was $25.50 on $1,000. The population in 1870 was 31,413. By the census of 1880 it was found to have increased to 33,810. POWnal is situated in the south-eastern part of Cumberland County, and on its north-west adjoins Durham, in Androscoggin County. New Gloucester bounds it on the north-west, North Yar mouth on the west, and its southern angle rests upon Yarmouth. Tho town has an area of about 18,000 acres. The surface is undulating, and the soil is generally fertile. Agriculture is the chief occupation. For many years past, the town has sent to the coas1>cities large quan tities of hay. Bradbury's Mountain is much the highest elevation of land in town, affording magnificent views inland and seaward. It was a station of the coast survey. The streams are the eastern branches of Royal's River. Two saw-mills and a grist-mill are the only manufac tories in which water-power is used at present. Other manufactures are boots and shoes, carriages, harnesses, etc. Pownal was formerly a part of Freeport, having been set off from that town and incorporated in 1808. Its early history will therefore be found in that of the parent town. At the meeting in 1807 to take the steps to form an independent town, the citizens chosen as a com mittee to agree on a line of separation were, Edward Thompson, Leb bens Turtle and Jabez True. On the petition to the legislature for in corporation occur the names of citizens Edmund Cleaves, Jacob Davis, Joseph Hutchins, Nathaniel Noyes, Benjamin A. Richardson, Edward Thompson, William Sawyer, and Benjamin Humphrey. The town has a Congregational, a Free Baptist and a Methodist church. Pownal has eleven public schoolhouses, valued at $4,200. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $378,355. In 1880 it was $303,486. The rate of taxation in 1880 was one dollar and sixty cents on one hundred dollars. The population in 1870 was 981. In the census of 1880 it was 876. POWnalborO included the present towns of Dresden, Wis casset, Alna, and Perkins (Swan Island). Its plantation name was Frankfort; and Fort Shirley, situated within it, opposite the upper end of Swan Island, was sometimes called Fort Frankfort. This was the name of a town in Germany from which some of the settlers had come, and was doubtless adopted on their account. Pownalboro was incorporated in 1760, being named in honor of the Massachusetts gov ernor at that date. It was at once made the shire town of Lincoln County, and thus remained for thirty-four years. Its first represen tative to the General Court was Thomas Rice. Dresden (including Swan Island, now the town of Perkins) and Alna were set off in 1794, and the name was retained by the remainder of the former town, but was in 1802 changed to Wiscasset. PrentiSS lies at the eastern border of Penobscot County, 75 miles north-east of Bangor. Drew Plantation bounds it on the north, Webster Plantation on the west, Carroll Plantation on the south, and"], [478, "470 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. a township of Washington County on the east. Mattagordus Stream and Mud Brook with their branches furnish drainage ; and each has one or more good powers. On Mud Brook near where it is crossed by the second road to Drew Plantation is a saw-mill manufacturing long and short lumber. The soil is a yellow loam, yielding well of the usual farm crops. This was formerly Township No. 7, Range 3, north of Bingham's Penobscot purchase. It was incorporated Feb. 27, 1858, and was named for Hon. Henry E. Prentiss, at one time mayor of Bangor, who owned most of the township. Prentiss has five public schoolhouses. The entire school property is valued at $2,400. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $54,385. In 1880 it was $67,789. PreSQUe Isle lies in the second range of townships in Aroostook County, a few miles south of Aroostook River. It is bounded on the north by Maysville, south by Westfield Plantation, east by Easton, and west by Chapman and Mapleton plantations. The Presque Isle Stream enters on the west side of the town and leaves it on the north. Presque Isle Village, the principal centre of business, is situated on the stream near the northern line. In the southern part, a little west of a middle line, in Quaggy Joe Lake, one mile in length, having Arnold Brook as an outlet. On this, near the pond, is the small village of Spragueville. Sonth by south-west of the village is the four-peaked \" Green Mountain,\" lying in a true north and south line. The middle of the town generally is elevated, and there are still ex tensive forests in the western, southern and eastern parts. There is a lumber and a cabinet mill at Spragueville, and at Presque Isle Village are two lumber-mills, a grist-mill, a wool-carding mill, furniture, car riage, tinware factories, and other small manufactures. This town is 42 miles north by north-west of Houlton, on the stage-line to Caribou. It is also the terminus of stage-lines to Ashland, Washburn and Fort Fairfield. At the village is published \" The North Star,\" a lively sheet, at present Greenback in politics. The publishers are F. G. Parker & Co. This town was incorporated April 4, 1859. It has a good high school in Presque Isle Village, and its schoolhouses number nine, and are valued at $3,000. The population in 1870 was 970. In 1880 it was 1,305.

Shining Lake occupies a large proportion of the south-western part of the town. Big Lake and its outlet, the west branch of St. Croix River form the northern boundary line. On this stream, at the foot of the lakes, lies Princeton Village, the terminus of the St. Croix"], [479, "PROSPECT. 471 and Penobscot railroad. A stage-line to Forest Station connects with the European and North American railway and Lake Navigation's route from Grand Lake Stream. There are here a large tannery, a woolen mill, two gang saw-mills, shingle-mills and a grist-mill. There are also other small manufactures usually carried on in villages. The chain of lakes which terminate at this point extends some 30 miles north-westerly toward the Penobscot River. When clear of ice they are navigable to the remotest point. A heavy and valuable growth of soft timber still borders their shores, though immense quantities have been cut annually for many years. There is a fish-hatching establish ment on Grand Lake Stream, and another on Sysladobsis Lake. Princeton is 44 miles north of Machias, and 20 from Calais. It was formerly Township No. 17, eastern division of Bingham's purchase. The first settlements in this town were made in 1815, and on Feb. 3, 1832, it was incorporated. The religious societies are Congregation alist and Baptist. There are five public schoolhouses in the town, valued, with other school property, at $4,500. The population in 1870 was 1,072. In 1880 it was 1,038. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $180,507. In 1880 it was $176,518. Pl*OSpeCt lies on the Penobscot River, in the eastern part of Waldo County. Frankfort bounds it on the north, Stockton on the south, and Searsport on the west. It is about six miles in length, east and w-est, and three miles in width. Perhaps one-fourth the land is suitable for tillage, while the remainder is rocky and mountainous. Heagen Mountain in the north-east and Mack's in the northern part are the highest elevations. Others are French's Hill and Eustis Mountain, in the south-eastern part of the town. Half-moon Pond, on the north- western border is the largest pond. Others are Seavy, Ellis, etc. Grant's River, or the south branch of Marsh River, runs by a very wind- ing course north-easterly through the town. Upon this stream, at the village near the centre of the town, are a lumber mill, and another manufacturing lumber and cooper's ware. Near by is the Prospect and Stockton cheese factory. The rock along the river is porphyritic. There is much old growth forest still remaining. In the north-eastern part of the town is a marsh, having an area of two or three hundred acres. In the vicinity of Fort Knox, a short distance above the ferry to Bucksport, lead ore has been exhumed. A superstition prevailed here, many years ago, that valuable treasures had been hidden by pirates at \" Cod Lead,\" a gravel mound near the north line of the town, directly east of Mosquito Mountain ; and there was an immense amount of digging without profit. Prospect is 14 miles north-east of Belfast and Bangor stage-line. This town was incorporated February 24, 1794. The name was sug gested by its beautiful views. As incorporated, it was about 17 miles in length from north to south. In 1845 a large proportion of the town on the west and south-west was set off from Searsport ; and in 1857 Stockton was formed from the southern portion of the remaining terri, tory. The first notable event in the history of this region was the con* truction of a small fortification called Fort Pownal on the spot now known as Fort Point. Stockton now embraces this locality. The"], [480, "472 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. fortification was garrisoned with 100 men ; but on the downfall of the French power in the north, the number was reduced to a mere guard. At the opening of the Revolution, the fort was in charge of Colonel Goldthwait, who was superintendant of the valuable traffic with the Indians of this place. In March, 1775, Captain Mowatt, notorious for his cruel bombardment and burning of Falmouth (Portland), a few months later sailed up the river, and transferred to his vessel all the heavy guns and the ammunition. The first inhabitants, some of whom had been soldiers in the French and Indian wars, settled near this fort. John Odom, who built the first mill on the Penobscot River, settled at Sandy Point about three miles above the fort. Other early inhabitants were a Mr. Clifford, Mr, Treat two or three named Colson, and Charles Curtis, from whom Curtis Point has its name. \" Captain John Odom, a grandson of the pioneer of the same name, was a resident of this town. He was born March, 1787, and followed the sea 45 years. He was impressed, when a young man into the British service, and was present at the battle of Corimna, in Spain, when Sir John Moore was killed. In this battle he was useful in carrying off the wounded and attending to their wants. He obtained his release from the British service soon after and returned home in 1811.

Dallas plantation bounds it on the east, Rangeley plantation on the south, and a part of Oxford County on the west. The area is 25,792 acres. The southern third of the town, almost from the eastern to the western line, a distance of eight miles, is occupied by Rangeley Lake. On the north-eastern angle of the lake and three miles north of Greenvale is \" Rangeley City,\" the village of the town.

It is in charge of old Sergeant Walker, a veteran who was a favorite of General Scott, and is tlieref ore kept in service. The fort is constructed of granite from Mount Waldo, and it is massive and solid as the rocks on which it rests. Begun in 184fi, it is not yet completed, as work on it has long sinc-3 ceased, and will pro bably never be resumed. Costing about a million dollars, it stands a monument of human folly ; for the recent advance in the science of war is such that it would be scarcely more effective in time of danger than an ancient feudal castle of the Middle Ages. A walk througli its winding passages and long encircling rifle-gallery is interesting to the visitor, if not wearisome. \u2014 Crocker & Howard's Hist, of New England, p. 126, note."], [481, "RANGELEY PLANTATION. 473 head of the lake. At the western end is Bald Mountain, constituting the divide between Rangeley and Mooselucmaguntic lakes. Its height is about 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. The head of Rangeley Lake is itself 1512 feet above tide-water. The other principal sheets of water in the town are Quimby, Dodge and Round ponds, each about one mile in length. Indian Rock, a noted fishing place, is situated at the extreme west of the town, where the outlet of Rangeley Lake discharges into Cupsuptic Lake. A post-office was recently established here. Rangeley village contains above 20 dwelling houses, two stores, a post office, a carriage shop, two blacksmith shops, a boat-builder's shop, a saw-mill, shoe shop, and two hotels, \u2014 one being quite large. One of these mills is run by steam-power. Excellent boats for use in the region are constructed here. The nearest railroad station is that of the Sandy River Railroad at Phillips. \u2022 The most numerous varieties of trees in this town are spruce, birch and maple. The soil is in some parts loam, in others, somewhat marly. The crops cultivated with success are wheat, oats, barley and potatoes. Much lumbering is done in the region, and summer tourists also afford considerable profit. Rangeley was incorporated as a town in 1855. It has its name from an English gentleman, who, having emigrated to New York, by some of his business transactions became unintentionally the proprietor of the tract. After a few pioneer families had made clearings and erected cabins, he visited the place, and was so well pleased with this piece of wilderness that he undertook to reproduce the English system of landlord and tenant here. He erected a two story mansion of good architecture in a beautiful situation, and removed thither with his accomplished family. He found little sympathy and some opposition among the increasing community, but persevered in the erection of mills and opening of roads, securing the rapid develop ment of a flourishing settlement. The attention of the settlers was largely turned to grazing, and they soon found a sale for their surplus cattle at their own doors. When lumbering increased there was a ready market for their hay. The Niles and Toothaker families are peculiarly worthy of mention for their exertions in developing the latent resources of northern Franklin. Mr. Rangeley continued to reside at the lake for fifteen years, ob serving in social life much of the form and ceremony practised by the English nobility. His daughter dying, he at length sold his property here, and with his wife, removed to Portland, where they resided for several years. From thence he removed to Henry County, N.C., where he died. Rangeley sent 10 men to the aid of the Union in the war of the Rebellion, losing four. The town has four public schoolhouses and its entire school property is valued at $2,400. The value of estates in 1870 was $75,239. In 1880 it was $103,241. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 11 mills on $1. The population in 1870 was 313. In 1880 it was 180.

At the end of the cape is Fry's Island. The body of water enclosed by the cape and island is called Jordan Bay. Gray bounds Raymond on the south-east, Casco, on the north-west, New Gloucester and Poland in Androscoggin County on the north-east. The surface of the town is uneven. Rattlesnake Mountain is the highest elevation of land. The soil is hard, gravelly, and many parts quite stony. The town has been noted for its abundance of white oak. There are five ponds partly or wholly within the town, \u2014 Nubble, at the north-east cor ner, Little Rattlesnake west of it, Great Rattlesnake, near the western border, Panther Pond in the south-western part, and Thomas Pond at the south-west corner.

Raymond was the home of Nathaniel Hawthorne, the distinguished novelist, during his boyhood. This township was granted by Massachusetts to Captain \" illiam Raymond and Company, in 1767, in consideration of their services in the expedition to Canada, under Sir William Phips. It also comprised the territory of Casco, until the incorporation of that town in 1841. Captain Joseph Dingley commenced the ssttlement of Raymond in 1771 ; but few families came until after the Revolution. It was incor porated in 1803, taking its name from Captain Raymond.

It is bounded on the east by the narrow town of Manchester, which alone separates it from Augusta, north by Mount Vernon and Belgrade, west by Fayette and Wayne, and south by Winthrop. Maranocook Pond and Greely Pond with their connecting stream divide the town a little west of the middle. Lovejoy's Pond occupies the southern half of the western line, and the eastern branch of Crotched Pond a portion of the same line on its northern half. In the south-eastern part of the town lies the larger portion of Carbon's Pond. There are post-officis at Readfield Comer, Kent's Hill and Readfield Depot. East Readfield, at the south-west of the town, has a Methodist church and a schoolhou>e, with a small collection of dwel lings, forming a pleasant street. Readfield Corner, a little west of the centre of the town, on the stream which discharges the waters of Greely Pond into Lake Maranocook, is the principal business place. There is here a fall of 40 feet in 160 rods, furnishing the power for the woolen factory of the Readfield Manufacturing Company, a sash and blind factory, etc. Beside the railway, there is a daily stage-line to Augusta, about 12 miles distant. In 1825 an educational institution calledthe Maine Wesleyan Seminary was instituted on Kent's Hill in this town, under the auspices of the Methodists. In 1852 it became also a college for young women. Both the seminary and college have taken high rank among our literary institutions, and received a good share of patronage. Kent's Hill is said to have taken its name from a family of early settlers. Another early settler was Joshua Bean, who was a large landholder in the town. Others of these pioneers are John Hubbard, Robert Page, Christopher Turner, Josiah Mitchell, Joseph Williams, Dudley Haines, Josiah Hall, Peter Noyes, Warren Kent, three brothers named Whittier, John Grey, Ichabod Simmons, John Gage, Jeremiah Glidden, Pearly Hoyt and Peter Norton. Jonathan G. Hunton, one of our State governors, resided and prac ticed law for a time in Readfield. Hon. Anson P. Morrill, formerly governor of Maine, and later, a member of Congress, resides at Read field Corner, being largely interested in the manufactures. Readfield was formerly a part of Winthrop, from which it was set off and incorporated in 1791. The surface of the town is generally undulating, and the soil productive. For stock-raising and dairying, it is in the first rank in the State. The fairs of the Kennebec Agri cultural Society', when held here, are always successful. There are three Methodist churches and a Universalist church in the town. Readfield has nine public schoolhouses, valued at $6,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $589,171.

The Main Central railroad passes through the town near the river, having a station at the village in the south-east part of the town, and flag stations at Iceboro' and the Camp-ground. Gardiner bounds it on the north, Bowdoinham on the south, Dresden on the east and Littlefield on the west. In dimensions, the town is about b\\ by 6 miles. The surface is rolling with moderate hills. Preble, Wilson, and Mount Tom hills are the prin cipal elevations. Cobbossee Contee, or Pleasant Pond, with its southern feeder, forms the western boundary of the town. The pond is about five miles in length, but is scarcely more than half a mile wide at its widest part. Abagadasset River rises in the north western part and runs south ward through the town. Mill Brook is the principal stream in the eastern part of the town, discharging into the Kennebec at the village, in south-eastern part of the town. Richmond Mineral Spring is highly esteemed by some. The rock is generally granitic in its character. The soil is largely clay, and rather hard to work. Hay and potatoes constitute the chief crops for export. Oak, beech, birch, maple, elm, spruce, fir and pine are all abundant. Elm, maple and willow are numerous along the village streets. At the village are the shoe factory of Richmond Manufacturing Association, employing when full 600 hands, a brass foundry, a large saw and planing mill, four ship-yards, a furniture factory, a sail-loft, bakery, edge-tool shops, etc. Here, also, is a good library of above 2,500 volumes belonging to the Richmond Library Association, but accessible to the public. Richmond has the usual social and charitable institutions, and there is also a loan and building association, which has aided to increase the buildings and business of the town. In 1649, one Christopher Lawson purchased of the Indians a tract of land on the w-estern side of the Kenebec, extending from the mouth of the stream falling into the river near the head of Swan Island (town of Perkins) to the mouth of the Cobbossee Contee, and back from the Kennebec 10 miles. In 1650, this tract was sold by Lawson to Clark and Lake. It is about equally divid- d between Richmond and Gardiner. In 1719-20 a fortification bearing the name \" Fort Richmond,\" was erected within the present limits of Richmond Village,"], [486, "478 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. which was dismantled in 1754, when the forts Shirley, Western and Halifax were built further up the river. Its purpose was to facilitate trade with the Indians, and at the same time to afford security to the 6ettlers against them. It was sharply assailed by the savages in 1722, and again in 1750. On the incorporation of Bowdoinham in 1762. the territory now comprising Richmond was embraced in it, which brought on a violent contest between the claimants under the Plymouth Patent and those who held under Lawson's purchase.

There are nine other persons above this age, and the number who are between 70 and 80 is large. The Congregationalists, Free Baptists and Methodists each have a church in town. Richmond has thirteen schoolhouses, the total school property being valued at $7,200. Richmond Academy, incorporated in 1861, is still sustained in connection with the town high-school. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,242,040. In 1880 it was $1,221 354. The population in 1870 was 2,442. In 1880 it was 2,658. Riley Plantation forms a part of the western border of Oxford County, and is the next township north of Gilead, through which the Androscoggin River enters the State, Grafton lies on the north, Newry on the east, and Success Township in New Hampshire, on the west. Its chief mountains are Goose-Eye and Wheeler's, with Stone Mountain at the north-east on the border of Newry. Miles Notch between the latter mountain, and one north-west of it, displays some remarkable features. Youngman's Mine, in this township, is spoken of as a natural curiosity. This plantation is wholly mountainous, except a small strip at the south-west corner, and in the middle on the branches of Sunday River. Bull Branch is the principal stream. The arable parts have a light sandy, but productive soil. The forests are principally spruce. This locality has long been known as Riley, and is now organized as Riley Plantation. The most accessible post-office is Bethel. The valuation in 1860 was $5,014. In 1880 it was $18,800. In the census this plantation has been massed with Batchelder's grant, both having in 1860 a population of 32 ; in 1880, of 40. Ripley is a small farming town in the north-eastern part of the southern section of Somerset County. Cambridge bounds it on the north, S. Albaus on the south, Harmony on the west, and Dexter, in Pe-"], [487, "ROBBINSTON. 479 nobscot County, on the east. The surface of the town is uneven, but the soil is generally good. Maine Stream, a feeder of Moose Pond, forms the boundary line between the town and Cambridge. Roger's or Ripley Pond, lying in the south-eastern part of the town, is 2 miles long by \u00a7 of a mile wide. Its outlet furnishes a good water-power, which is improved by two saw-mills manufacturing long and short timber, and a grist mill. The larger part of the population of the town is in this vicinity. The nearest railroad connection is at Dexter, 4 miles distant from Ripley Village. The soil of the town is a gravelly loam. Maple, birch and beech constitute the forest trees. Hay, po tatoes, corn, wheat and oats all yield well. The buildings through the town are generally in good repair. Ripley sent some 30 men to the Union army in the late war, losing more than a third of this number. A marble monument has been erected to their memorv. The religious societies are Baptist, Methodist, Christian, and Chris tian Baptist, and there is a Union church edifice. The public school houses are five in number, and are valued at $1,200. The population in 1870 was 584. In 1880 it was 550. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $116,705. In 1880 it was $119,253. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 5 per cent, including highway tax. Riverside? \u2014 a post-office in Kennebec County, RODhillStOn lies on St. Croix River in the south-eastern part of Washington County. Calais bounds it on the north, Perry on the south and Charlotte on the west. The area is 17,800 acres. The surface of the town is quite level, but rising by a gradual slope from the river. Boyden Lake extends into the south-western part ; in the northern and central parts are West Magurrewock Lake and the smaller sheets of Rand's, Goulding, Western and Eastern lakes. The outlets of these supply power for several mills. The manufactures of this town are long and short lumber, wedges, laraquins, leather and moccasins, carriages, and canned fish of various kinds. For many years Robbinston was the centreof trade for the neighboring towns. Ship-building was formerly largely carried on here, while the ports of Europe furnished ready market for this product ; but since the introduction of steam vessels the business has de clined. The attention has now been turned more to food products. Potatoes, from the shortness of the season, mostly escape the diseases incident to longer seasons, and possess rare excellence, and accordingly are largely raised and eagerly sought for. The principal villages are Robbinston and South Robbinston. This town lies on Calais and East port stage-line. It is 35 miles north-east of Machias. Opposite, on the eastern side of the St. Croix is St. Andrews, a considerable port and village in the British Dominions. Robbinston was granted by Massachusetts, October 21, 1786, to Edwi.rd H. and Nathaniel J. Robbins, in honor of whom the town was named. Two families were already settled in the township when the grant was made. The proprietors soon made clearings and erected a 6tore-house and other buildings ; and settlers came rapidly. It is said by Williamson that a post-office was established nere as early as 1796, and that the first mail came"], [488, "480 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. through in September in that year. In 1810, the inhabitants petitioned for incorporation as a town ; and appointed as a committee to present it, John Brewer, Thomas Vose, John Balkham, Obadiah Allen, Abel Brooks, Job Jonson and Thaddeus Sibly which petition was granted, and the required act passed, February 18, 1811. A meeting-house was built here in 1817, and in the following year Rev. Daniel Lovejoy was settled by the Congregationalists. The society still flourishes ; and there are now also societies of the Baptists and Methodists. The town has six public schoolhouses ; and the school property is valued at $2,500. The population in 1870 was 926. In 1880 it was 910. The valuation in 1870 was $127,030. In 1880 it was $111,694. ROCkahema, \u2014 a post-office and a lake in Moro Plantation, Aroostook County. ROCklaild, a city, and the shire town of Knox County, is situated on Rockland Bay, on the western side of Penobscot Bay. Its harbor is enclosed by two headlands, Jameson's Point on the north and the long projection of Thomaston, terminating in Owl's Head, on the south. The city, being located on level land, is better seen from the neighboring headlands and the hills in the rear than from the ap proaches of the harbor. The surface of the town is rough and broken, low near the shore, but in the western part of the town rising in a chain of hills extending northward from Thomaston, and ending in the Camden mountains. The environs abound in picturesque hill and marine scenery. The north-west is occupied by an extensive meadow. Limestone is the prevailing rock. The soil is generally clay or loam. Among the forest trees the red oak is numerous. The streets of the city proper are extensively shaded with elm and rock-maple. The only considerable sheet of water is Chickawaukie pond, lying partly in Camden, which, by means of an aqueduct, supplies the city with ex cellent water. Rockland has three or more ship-yards, one marine railway, five sail-lofts, two boat-builders, three grain mills, two foundries, three car riage factories, six lumber mills, two machine shops, three cooperies, a tannery, twelve lime manufacturers, four granite and marble works, two boot and shoe factories, four printing-offices, etc. Formerly ship building was the leading industry, but the lime business has now out grown it. In 1854, Rockland ship-yards sent out eleven ships, three barks, six brigs, and four schooners, \u2014 their total tonnage being 17,365 tons. The \" Red Jacket,\" registering 2,500 tons, was built here in 1853, being one of the largest and finest vessels ever sent out from our ports. She made the quickest passage across the Atlantic ever made by a sailing vessel, and the quickest from Australia to Liverpool and back. In 1858 there were twelve lime quarries in operation, requiring 125 kilns of the old style to reduce the rock, turning out about 900,000 casks, upwards of 300 vessels being employed in conveying them to market. The amount now produced is 1,200,000 casks annually, the lime industry employing about 1,000 men. Rockland is a port of entry in the Waldoboro district. The Knox and Lincoln railroad connects it with Bath and the Maine Central railroad. This town was first visited by John Lermond and his two brothers"], [489, "ROCKLAND. 481 from Upper St. George (now Warren) ; who, in 1767, built their camp and got out a cargo of oak staves and pine lumber. From him the place obtained its early name of Lermond's Cove. Its Indian name was Catawamteak, signifying \" great landing place.\" Lermond did not stay, and the town was not permanently settled until about 1769, when the following persons with families took up their abode in the locality, viz. : Josiah Tolman, Jonathan Spear, David Watson, James Fales, John Lindsay, Constant Rankin, Jonathan Smith and John Godding. These all erected log huts, and commenced clearing up and cultivating their lots. John Ulmer, of Waldoboro', moved here in 1795, and began the manufacture of lime, in which business he was the pioneer. The growth of the place was slow, and in 1795 the dwelling of John Lindsay was the only house where the city now stands. The territory was included in Thomaston, and after that town was incorporated, the settlement on Lermond's Cove was known as Shore Village. On the establishment of a post-office here, about 1820, it took the name of East Thomaston ; and on the division of the parent town in 1848, Rockland was incorporated under this name. The name was changed to Rock land in 1850, and in 1853 it obtained a city charter. Rockland has several tasteful and substantial public buildings. The post-office is a handsome and spacious structure of St. George's granite, built a few years since at a cost, including grounds and furniture, of $142,000. The county court-house, erected in 1874, cost $80,000. The Farwell building is another prominent, though not a public edifice, erected in 1871. Among the eminent citizens of Rockland may be mentioned Robert and Charles Crockett, Timothy Williams, and Gen eral Hiram E. Berry. The latter, after having made a high reputation as a skilful officer, fell while leading his division on the bloody field of Chancellorsville. A colossal statue of him in marble by Simmons, on a handsome pedestal, keeps guard over his resting place in the city of his birth and residence. The Rockland Savings Bank at the close of 1879, held deposits and profits to the amount of $283,885.21. There are three banks of dis count and circulation. The Lime Rock National Bank has a capital of $105,000. The North National Bank has a capital of $100,000. The Rockland National Bank has a capital of $150,000. The city has three newspapers and a sheet devoted to the interests of hotels. The latter is entitled the \" Hotel Register and Livery Journal,\" and is published ever Monday. The Rockland Free Press, published every Wednesday, is a valuable city weekly of Republican politics. The Rock land Gazette, is independent in politics, and an entertaining and useful paper. The Rockland Courier, also independent, fills an im portant place in the city and country. The Rockland Opinion, is a very positively Democratic sheet, outspoken and vigorous on publio questions, and a successful news-gatherer. There is a public library containing 3,500 volumes. The churches of the city consist of two Baptist, one each of the Free Baptists, Congregationalists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Roman Catholics and Universalists. The last was built in 1876, at a cost of $26,000. There are three fine schoolhouses in the city proper, where the schools are graded. The number of public schoolhouses in the entire city is eleven. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $3,419,-. ' 31"], [490, "i 482 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 355. In 1880 it was $2,951,019. The rate of taxation in the latter year was three per cent. The population in 1870 was 7,074. In 1880 it was 7,599. Rockport, a post-office and village in Camden, Knox County. Rockville, a post-office and small village in Camden, Knox County. RODie is situated in the north-westerly part of Kennebec County, 19 miles from Augusta, and 16 miles from Farmington. Vienna lies on the west, Mount Vernon on the west and south, Belgrade on the south and east ; a portion of Smithfield, in Somerset County, lies on the east of the northern part, and Mercer on the north, and New Sharon in Franklin County on the west of the northern portion. Long Pond, in the southern portion, Great Pond at the south-east, and North Pond at the north-east, take up nearly half the surface of the town ship. It was settled about 1780. Among the early inhabitants were Benjamin Furbush, Trip Mosher, Stephen Philbrick, Stabard Turner, and Joseph Halbo. These obtained their titles to their lands of Charles Vaughan, R. G. Shaw, Renel Williams. It was first called West Pond Plantation, but was incorporated under its present name in 1804. Rome sent into the war of the Rebellion 103, and lost about 40. The town is much broken by hills and valleys, but furnishes excellent grazing, and has some superior farms. The principal rock is granite, and the soil in general is gravelly. There are two post-offices \u2014 Rome, near the centre of the town, and Belgrade Mills, at the south-east. The principal manufactures are a saw-mill and a grist-mill. The Baptists and the Adventists each have a society and a church in the town. Rome has seven schoolhouses, valued at $1,400. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $149,731. In 1880 it was $129,857. The rate of taxation in 1880 is stated as being .033 on one dollar. The population in 1870 was 725. In 1880, the census gave it ROSS' Corners, a post-office in York County. ROlind Pond, a post-office in Lincoln County. ROXDUry lies in the north-eastern part of the middle section of Oxford County, adjoining Franklin County. Byron bounds it on the north-west, Andover on the south-west, and Rumford and Mexico and Carthage on the south. Ellis Pond, the largest sheet of water, lies in the north-west corner, having Ellis River as an outlet. Swift River runs southward across the eastern part of the town. Old Turk is the highest of the several mountains, having an elevation of 1,436 feet. The eastern part of the town is largely occupied by a group of mountains, of which the most notable are Bear \u2014 on the border line \u2014 with Walker, Cave and Bunker mountains following to the river. In the north-east, Noisy Brook winds around the base of another to the river. In the south side of the middle of the town two mountains form the noted Roxbury Notch. Ellis Falls, in Andover, are near the western line of this town. The rock is chiefly granite. The soil of"], [491, "RUMFORD. 483 Roxbury is generally a gravelly loam, with some good low intervals. A tract in the western part of the town, and another extending in irregular form from the centre to the northern and eastern borders, are comparatively level. Pine, poplar, birch and maple are the principal forest trees. Much hay is raised here, finding a sale with the lumber men ; and considerable stock is kept also. The largest manufactory is a shoe shop, where one case of shoes a day is made. The buildings are not generally kept in the best repair, but the roads are of average quality. The nearest railroad stations are in Woodstock and Bethel, \u2014 several about 20 miles distant. The town is on the stage-line from Mexico to Byron. Roxbury\u2014 formerly No. 7 \u2014 was incorporated March 17, 1835. The town sent 16 men to aid in the war for the Union, of whom 3 were lost. There are three public schoolhouses, \u2014 and the school property is valued at $400. The population in 1870 was 162. In 1880 it was 175. The valuation in 1870 was $48,856. In 1880 it was $23,201. RlimiOrd lies in the northern part of the middle section of Oxford County, having Andover, Roxbury and Mexico on the north west, north and north-east, Peru directly east, Bethel, and Milton and' Franklin plantations on the south and Newry on the west. The An droscoggin River runs north-eastward through the southern part of the town, Ellis River comes down to it through the western part, Swift River in the eastern part, and Concord River from the south enter the Androscoggin at Rumford Point. In the southern half of the town and in the extreme north are mountains ; but between these the surface is generally level. The most important elevations are White Cap (600 \u2022 feet in height) and Black Mountain, at the north, and Mount Heming way at the extreme south. The northern mountains especially are noted for their immense crop of blueberries. The rock in the town is chiefly granite. The soil, in general, is sandy. Birch, maple, poplar and pine trees constitute the forests. Wheat, corn, oats and potatoes are the crops chiefly cultivated, and yield well. The principal village is East Rumford on the Androscoggin in the eastern part of the town. There are here three saw-mills manufacturing long and short lumber, a shovel handle factory, a grist-mill, a cheese, and a starch factory. On or near Concord River (Rumford Post-Office) are saw, grist and shingle-mills. At this and other points are the other manufactories common to villages. The public and private buildings are neat in their appearance,. and the public roads are generally very good. Other Post-Offices are Rumford Centre and Rumford Point. The nearest railroad stations are those in Bethel and Woodstock. The stage-route from Bryant's Pond on the Grand Trunk railroad to Andover is through this town. About 3 miles above Rumford Point Village is a paint mine,^ formed by deposit from a spring of the ochreous red oxide of iron. Near this is considerable deposit of iron ore. On the Alonzo Holt farm, black lead or plumbago has been found in considerable quantities.. Lime stone abounds in several places, but more largely at Rumford Falls. These falls are in the Androscoggin River in the eastern part\" of the town, and form the grandest cataract in New England. Here' the whole volume of the river leaps over abrupt and craggy ledges of granite, dashing the spray far into the air. At present there are three or four pitches at this place, but anciently there must have been a dc-"], [492, "UPPER FALLS, RUMFOED, ME."], [493, "RUMFORD. 485 scent of greater magnitude ; for large holes peculiar to falls are found high in the rocky banks, far above where the waters have run within the knowledge of man. The whole pitch is from 160 to 170 feet. The principal one has a perpendicular descent of 84 feet, somewhat broken by rocks near the middle of the stream. In 1833, a stone flume was built at the head of this fall to divert a portion of the water to mills. After its completion, Mr. Nathan Knapp, one of the proprietors, stepped upon the wall to see if it was tight, \u2014 when 30 feet of it were forced over by the water, and he was precipitated to the base of the fall, and drowned. A few years since a steamboat was placed in this river, to run between the falls and Canton, where it connected with the Buck field and Rumford railroad. This township was granted by Massachusetts in 1779 to Timothy Walker, jr., and his associates, of Concord, N. H., to make up losses which they and their ancestors sustained in controversy with the town LOWEB FALLS, EtJMFOBD, ME. of Bow, growing out of the purchase of Concord. The township was at first named New Pennacook. The pioneers were Jonathan Keyes and his son Francis, who arrived from Massachusetts in June, 1782. A few years later came Philip and David Abbott, Jacob, Benjamin and David Farnum, Benjamin Luskin and wife, Stephen Putnam ana wife, and John, Daniel and Kimball Martin,\u2014 these coming principally from Concord, N.

SabinO PeninSllla, the site of the Popham colony. See articles on Sagadahoc County and Phipsburg. SaCCarappa, a village with railroad station and post-office in Westbrook, Cumberland County. SaCO, in York County, was granted in 1630, to Thomas Lewis and Richard Bonython, by the Plymouth Company, though the latter had, in 1622, granted nearly the whole territory between this and the Kennebec River, to Mason and Gorges. The tract granted to Lewis and Bonython, extended four miles along the sea in a straight line, and back into the country eight miles. The limits, as surveyed by the commissioners appointed by Massachusetts, in 1659, commenced at the mouth of Little River and run on a north-west line, leaving about 3,000 acres in Scarborough that belonged to the original patent. This grant was also over-lapped by the \" Plough Patent,\" issued the same year. The settlement on this grant with that on the other side of the river was known as Winter Harbor. In 1653, it was organized as Saco, and in 1659, began to be represented in General Court. In 1719, it was incorporated as Biddeford, being the fourth town in Maine ; in 1762 it received a separate incorporation, with all the rights of a town ex cept that of sending a representative to the General Assembly. This incorporation was under the name of Pepperellborough, in honor of Sir William Pepperell, then recently deceased, who had been a large proprietor. In 1805, by act of Legislature, its name was changed to Saco ; and in 1867 it became a eity. The first mayor was Joseph Hobson. The name, Saco, is of Indian origin. The river separates the city from Biddeford on the south-west, Scarborough bounds it on the north-east, on the west and north-west is Buxton, and Old Orchard Beach forms its junction with the sea on the east. The area is about 17,500 acres. For many years the habitations were located near the sea, at Old Orchard Beaeh and toward the mouth of the river. Rich ard Vines was the founder of the settlements in this vicinity, having himself wintered at the mouth of the river, in 1616-17. Among the early inhabitants were Scammans, Edgecombs, Townsends, Youngs, Sharps, Banks, Sands, and Googins. There were a considerable num ber of respectable Scotch immigrants from the northern part of Ire land, who came over about 1718, and after. Captain Scamman and persons employed at the mill, with their families, were all that were settled about the falls until 1731. In 1680, Benjamin Blackman pur chased 100 acres of land including the mill privileges on the east side of the Saco Falls, and built a saw-mill. During the year 1675, the first year of the first Indian war, Major Phillips on the Biddeford side of the river was attacked, and success-"], [495, "BOSTON & MAINE RAILROAD BRIDGE, SACO, ME."], [496, "488 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. fully defended. About the same time, the house of John Bonython, in Saco, was burned, but the family had escaped. The settlers about the falls soon retired to near the mouth of the river, and all the mills and houses above were destroyed by the Indians. Captain Wincoln, and others of Piscataqua, coming soon after to aid their neighbors of the Saco, were discovered by some of the Indians, and fired upon. Informed of the approach of the English, about 150 savages rushed out of the woods toward them, as they landed on the beach near Winter Harbor. During the skirmish, Wincoln and his men found protection behind a pile of shingle-bolts; and, with this advantage, they soon drove their assailants from the ground, inflicting upon them a consid erable loss. Eleven of the inhabitants of Winter Harbor set out to aid their friends, whose presence and danger had been announced by the firing ; but a body of Indians lay in ambush on their road, and shot them all down at a single discharge. In 1676, the house of Thomas Rogers, near Goosefare, was burned. In 1688, during the second war, some of the Indians on the river having uttered alarm ing threats, sixteen of those who had been most active in the recent war, were seized and taken to Boston, but without averting the threat ened war. In April, 1689, the savages commenced hostilities, and the family of Humphrey Scamman and others were carried into captivity. Most \"of the men were absent from the fort when the alarm was given there, and the women immediately arrayed themselves in male apparel, and stalked about the fort, thus deceiving the skulking savages until the men got in from their work. Again from 1702 to 1710, Indian hostilities prevailed. About 1713, the inhabitants began to return to their homes ; and the settlement prospered until 1723, when another Indian war broke out, lasting three years. There were at this time besides Fort Mary, fourteen garrisons along the river from the shore to the falls, most of them being in Saco. One of the captives during the first summer of this war was Mary, daughter of Captain Hum phrey Scammon, a girl eight or nine years of age. Pleased with her brightness the governor of Canada took her into his family, and edu cated her carefully in the Roman Catholic faith. She finally married a French gentleman of Quebec, of good estate, resisting all solicita tions to return to her native place. \" Several citizens of Saco were in the Louisburg expedition under Peppered, among whom were Deacon Benjamin Haley, Benjamin Scamman, Nathaniel Scamman, Andrew Stackpole, Roger Smith, Jonathan Smith, Haven Tarbox, and Benjamin Mason. The names of those in the continental army during the Revolution, are as follows : John Googins, killed at Hubbardston, Stephen Sawyer, John Hooper, Abiel Beette, Nicholas Davis, Jonathan Norton, Daniel Bryant, James Seamman, John Tucker, John Runnels, John Ridlon, Ebenezer Evans John and William Card, Levi, Richard, Zachariah aud Elias Foss, John Duren, Anthony and William Starbird, William Berry, James Evans, Samuel Sebastian, Joseph Norton, Major Stephen Bryant, Josiah Davis, Joseph Richards, Ephraim Ridlon, Stephen Googins, Thomas Means, Solomon Hopkins, James Edgecomb, and Solomon Libby. The following Saco men were in the company of Captain John Elden, of Buxton, in 1776, doing good service at Dorchester Heights, namely : Lieutenant Samuel Scamman (afterward deacon), Jerathuel Bryant, John Muchmore, Daniel Field,"], [497, "SACO. 489 David Clark, Abner Sawyer, Joseph Norton, Andrew Patterson, David Sawyer, Jr., James Edgecomb, Robert Bond, Daniel Field, Jr., Abra ham Patterson, Moses Ayer, John and Hezekiah Young, Joseph Patterson, William P. Moody, Samuel Dcnnet, John Scamman and Samuel Lowell. Colonel James Scamman led a regiment to Cam bridge early in 1775, which served about a year. Richard Bonython, the pioneer and one of Gorges' councillors, is notable as a faithful and just man, even entering a complaint against h_3 own sod John for using threatening language to the excellent Mr. Vines. John bore a different character, being violent and quarrel some. He seems not to have gained the confidence of the better or larger portion of his townsmen ; yet when Massachusetts extended her jurisdiction over Maine, he led the opposition, gaining the sobriquet of \" Sagamore of Saco.\" The following couplet is said to have been in scribed upon his tombstone, probably not by his relatives : \" Here lies Bonython, Sagamore of Saco, He lived a rogue, and died a knave and went to Hobbomocko \" Yet he was not without his good traits. In opposing Massachusetts he was vindicating the rights of Gorges-; and he generously presented the town with 20 acres of upland for the minister. Robert Patterson removed his family into the place in 1729, settling at Rendezvous Point, and was active in the service of the town. He and his de- scendants are noted for their longevity. Colonel Thomas Cutts, a descendant of a highly respectable family of Kittery, came to Saco about 1758, and commenced trade with a capital of $100. Though he had failed in Kittery in his first business venture, in Saco he developed \"an immense aptitude for business,\" and soon enlarged his capital, and em- barked in extensive enterprises. In 1759 he bought a share of Indian or Factory Island, as a place of business, and built a small house and store on the south-west end. He, later, engaged in shipbuilding and navigation, and for some years previous to the breaking out of the Revolution had a very profitable and extensive timber trade with the West Indies. Having become owner of nearly the whole of the island, he removed, in 1782, to an elegant house on the upper end, where he passed the remainder of his days, which ended in 1821. His real estate was appraised at nearly $100,000. Dr. Samuel White, Esq. (for he was a magistrate as well as a phy- sician), settled in Saco about 1750. Dr. Thomas G. Thornton, who came in 1791, married a daughter of Colonel Cutts, and then engaged in merchandizing. He was appointed United States Marshal of Maine in 1803, and discharged the duties of that office until his death in 1824. Dr. Richard Cutts Shannon was for some time a surgeon in the navy, but resigned and settled in Saco in 1800. During a period of nearly twenty-eight years following, he was the principal physician of the town, and at the time of his death, in 1828, was deacon of the first church. The first regular attorney here was Hon. Cyrus King. He had previously been private secretary to his brother Rufus, while am bassador to England, and was admitted to the bar in 1797, and com menced practice here. In 1812 he was chosen to represent York County in the thirteenth Congress. In 1815, he was appointed major general of the militia, and died suddenly in 1817. Joseph Bartlett came to Saco about 1803, practising law with success for several years."], [498, ""], [499, "SACO. 491 He was State senator in 1804. He built a singular but rather elegant house near the site of the old Ferry house. But he was an eccentric genius, as his \" Aphorisms \" declare. He first removed to Berwick, then became a wanderer. John Fairfield was reporter of law decisions in 1832; representative to the 24th and 25th Congress, from 1835 to 1838 ; governor of the State in 1839, 1841 and 1842; National senator from 1843 to 1847. Ether Shepley, on his admission to the bar, about 1814, came to Saco and commenced practice. After filling various offices with honor, he was elected National senator in 1833; in 1836 he was appointed judge of the Supreme Court, and chief justice in 1848. In 1855, he retired from the bench ; and in 1856 he was chosen sole commissioner to revise the public laws. He received his honorary degree of L.L.D. from Dartmouth College, and was thirty-three years trustee of Bowdoin College. The following citizens of Saco of more recent date have attained to distinguished public position : \u2014 J. F. Scamman was representative to 29th Congress in 1845 ; William B. Hartwell was State secretary in 1 845 (; Seth Scamman was president of the State senate in 1858 ; Rufus P. Tapley was, in 1865, appointed associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court ; Edwin B. Smith was speaker of the Maine House in 1871, and is now assistant attorney general of the United States; and Wilbur F. Lunt is United States district attorney of Maine. Lumbering was the early business of the place, and the raw material was here turned into all varieties of stuff ; and a large business was carried on in it with the West Indies. For the year ending September 30, 1827, 21,000,000 feet had been sawn, the greater part for the home trade. In 1811 Joseph Calef and Thomas Cutts erected on Factory Island a rolling and slitting-tnill for iron, and eleven machines for making nails. A company, consisting mostly of Boston capitalists, began preparations for a cotton mill on Factory Island, cutting a canal through the solid rock to conduct the water-power. In 1829 their mill of 1,200 spindles and 300 looms commenced running, employing 400 persons; but in 1830 it was destroyed by a fire. The location is now occupied by the York Manufacturing Company. This company has five mills, and operates about 35,000 spindles and 800 looms, era ploying some 1,200 hands, and turning out nearly 6,000,000 yards of cotton goods annually. There are now four saw-mills, manufacturing longand short-lumber and box-shooks,three planing and moulding-mills, three door, sash and blind factories, several carriage factories, a tan nery, bleachery, also a belting, boot and shoe, loom-harness, soap, and other factories. The York National and the Saco National banks, in this city, each has a capital of $100,000. The Saco and Riddeford Savings Institution held, November 1, 1880, in deposits and accrued profits $1,214,899.82. Saco Savings Bank held at the same date $172, 838.89. William S. Noyes publishes here the York County Indepen dent, a family journal, and the State Democrat, a political sheet, \u2014 both excellent of their kind. The village of Saco, especially along the river road, presents many tokens of an early and prosperous period in the large, old mansions with ample yards, and other appearances of homely comfort with elegance. But the notable feature of Saco is its noble beach,* nearly nine miles in length, and affording a * See article on Old Orchard Beach."], [500, "GAZETEEER OF MAINE. 492 drive-way hundreds of feet wide, with the deep blue ocean booming on one side and lines of imposing hotels, and pretty cottages on the other. Near the hotels is a beautiful forest-park of 30 acres, with pleasant paths, arbors and rustic adornments. About two miles distant, on Foxwell's Brook, is a picturesque waterfall, 60 feet in height. The face of the country is little varied by hills, and is somewhat swampy in the middle of the town, shoreward of which is quite an ex tent of pine plain. In this vicinity the soil is a fine sandy loam ; in the interior the surface is more uneven and the soil more gravelly, and the hard woods flourish. Saco has churches of the Congregationalists, Baptists, Episcopals, Unitarians, and Christians, two of the Free Baptists, and two of the Methodists ; some of the edifices being quite elegant. The schools in the village are graded, from primary to high. The entire number of schoolhouses in the city is sixteen ; and the school property is valued at $18,125. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $3,116,374. In 1880 it was $3,408,533. The population at the same date was 5,755. In 1880 it was 6,395. See Biddeford. Saddleback Mountain, See article on Dallas Plan tation. SagadallOC County is situated upon the lower portions of the Kennebec and Androscoggin Rivers. Within it are contained Merrymeeting Bay, where the two rivers join ; Sagadahoc River, which they form ; and Back River, an arm of the Sagadahoc. Gener ally, however, the name Kennebec is applied to this stream quite to the sea, thus making the Androscoggin its tributary. This county contains ten towns and one city, as follows : city of Bath, towns of Arrowsie, Bowdoin, Bowdoinham, Georgetown, Perkins, Phipsbury, Richmond, Topsham, West Bath and Woolwich. The length of the county north and south is 33 miles, and its breadth, from 6 to 17 miles. It has an area of about 300 square miles, including water sur face, which is about 45 square miles. The county is chiefly remark able topographically for the number of its streams, bays and coves, and its numerous tide-powers. The surface of the county, though consider ably broken, has no high hills, and the general altitude is such that the fresh-water streams and salt inlets are not productive of deep ravines. In the south-eastern portion of the county especially, the bed rock is imperfectly covered with soil, and consequently, it shows many ledges. Three of its towns, Arrowsie, Perkins and Woolwich, are islands, and three, Phipsburg, Bath and West Bath are nearly so. The business is agriculture, ice-storage, lumber manufacture, ship-building, navigation, commerce and the fisheries. Steamboat communication with Portland and Boston is had through the whole length of the county, while during the hot months steamers run across the country from the Ken nebec towns to Boothbay beyond the Sheepscot River. The Maino Central Railroad traverses the western part north and south along the course of the Kennebec, and connects with the Knox and Lincoln Rail road, which connects Bath with Rockland on the Penobscot. Sagadahoc County was formerly included in Yorkshire, and later, in Lincoln County ; having been set off from the latter and incorpo rated in 1854. The exploring company of DeMonts, led by the intre-"], [501, "SAGADAHOC COUNTY. 493 pid Cham plain made the first known visit of Europeans to Sagadahoc. Popham's colony, having erected buildings and constructed a vessel, after a few months' sojourn forsook their settlement in 1608 ; but voy ages of the English to the vicinity for fur-trade and fishing were con tinued. Capt. John Smith, of Virginia fame, explored the region in 1614 ; and on the map of the country which he displayed to King Charles, that monarch entered the name \" Leethe \" as a substitute for '\u2022 Sagadahoc.\" When the Council of Plymouth was dissolved, and the territory divided, 10,000 acres somewhere on the east side of the Sagadahoc were added to each of seven of the twelve divisions, that each of the noble owners might share in the visionary metropolis of New England. The grant to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, in 1622, had for its eastern boun dary, the Sagadahoc. From this he granted to Sir Richard Edge comb, a tract on the north side of the Lake of New Somerset (Merry meeting Bay) and another on the coast, probably on New Meadows Harbor. The Pilgrims of New Plymouth received their patent rights i ENGLISH SilW Ob' XHJS 16th 0J22TTUKY. of trade on the Kennebec in 1623, which was enlarged in 16_9 to a right to the soil and exclusive rights of trade within its limits. The boundaries of this grant, like those of most of the early ones, were not accurately defined ; and when the patent passed from its Pilgrim own ership and became the Kennebec Purchase, its wealthy proprietors extended their claims over the territories of their neighbors beyond what generally found warrant in law, when the issues came to be tried in the courts. Thi \u2022 indefinite boundaries, therefore, were the cause of much litigation. Rights to the soil were sought from the natives also ; the first known being the Nequasset purchase, made in 1639 ; the islands below soon after, and within 20 years the whole of Saga dahoc County was held under titles from its Indian possessors. The \"rant to Purchase and Way which, together with the Pejepscot Purchase."], [502, "494 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. included a large part of Bowdoinham, and all of Topsham, Bath, West Bath, and Phipsburgh,was made in 1630 ; Purchase himself having resid ed near the Pejepscot (Brunswick) Falls since 1627. In 1654 New Ply mouth colony instituted a form of government covering all the settle ments of the Kennebec. This was succeeded by the more effective juris diction of Massachusetts, which continued, with a partial interruption only for a few years by the Duke of York's government, until Maine be came an independent State. In 1672, upon a petition of the settlers for protection, the territory beyond the Kennebec, which had been erected into the county of Cornwall by the Kings' commissioners, \u2014 deputies of the Duke of York, was transmuted into the county of Devonshire ; York being limited to the western side of the Sagadahoc. An appearance of right to exercise this jurisdiction had been secured by a new inter pretation of the terms fixing the boundary of her patent by Massachu setts. The motive for this movement was found in the new claim of the French, under the treaty of Breda, to the territory as far west as the Kennebec. The first Indian war isi Maine, called King Philip's war, broke out in 1675 ; yet the plundering of Mr. Purchas' house was the only hostile act in Sagadahoc County until August, 1676. At this date occurred the descent of the savages upon the settlements of Hammond, Clark and Lake, in which 53 persons were made captives by the Indians. The region was now almost wholly abandoned by settlers ; and though various small and temporary settlements were attempted, there was no permanent occupation until 1715, when twenty families located on Arrowsie, and the Pejepscot town of Augusta was begun under Dr. Noyes in Phipsburg. Yet these were swept away ; and forts and gar rison houses were often the only places of safety for the inhabitants, until the fall of the French power in the North in 1759 terminated the Indian wars in Maine. From 1717 to 1720 many Scotch-Irish Presby terians had come in ; and after Governor Dummer's treaties of 1725-7 the immigrants became numerous. During the Revolution, there was much alarm in the Sagadahoc region from British cruisers ; but no considerable action occurred. Two British armed vessels which threatened Bath, were attacked on their way up the river, and turned back. In the war of 1812, the noted action between the Enterprise and Boxer occurred off the mouth of the river. In the war of the Rebellion the county furnished to the Union forces 2,488 men. Robert Gutch and Ichabod Wiswell were the first religious ministers in the county, the first coming about 1660. Steam-power was first used on the Kennebec as early as 1818, for propelling rude craft ; and in 1823 steam communication was opened between Bath and Boston. What is now the Bath branch of the Maine Central Railroad was opened to the city in 1849 ; and the Knox and Lincoln Railroad was opened in 1871. The first newspaper was published in the county in 1820. There are now but two. Eight national banks and three savings institutions are located in the county. Sagadahoc County was set off from Lincoln and incorporated in 1854, Bath being made the shire town. Its valuation in 1870 was $11,041,340. In 1880 it was $10,297,215. The polls in 1870 numbered 4,669, and in 1880, 5,182. The population in 1870 was 18,803. In 1880 it was 19,276."], [503, "ST. GEORGE. 495 Sag\"adahOC River is the stream formed by the union of the Kennebec and Androscoggin, and extends from Merrymeeting Bay to the ocean. This was the Indian name for this stream and its vicin ity. Generally, however, the name Kennebec is applied to it quite to the sea, implying that the Androscoggin is a mere tributary to the somewhat larger Kennebec. St. AlbanS is situated in the south-eastern part of Somerset County, bordering on Penobscot County. It is bounded on the north by Ripley, east by Corinna, south by Palmyra, and west by Hartland and Harmony. Its area is 23,040 acres. The surface is undulating, and the soil is generally fertile. Nearly in the centre of the town is Indian Pond, with its length north-east and south-west. In the same line north-eastward is Little Indian Pond. Moose pond forms upward of one half of the western boundary. St. Albans village, the principal business centre, lies at the outlet of Indian Pond, at the south-western extremity. The manufactories at this place consist of a saw-mill for long lumber, and shingle and grist mills, a shovel-handle and sash and door factories, and others of less extent. St. Albans is 22 miles east by north-east from Skowhegan. It is 10 miles from the Maine Central Rail road station at Pittsfield on the stage line from that place to Harmony. This township was purchased of the State of Massachusetts in 1799 by Dr. John Warren, of Boston, and was settled during the following year. It was incorporated June 14, 1813. There are Congregationalist, Free Baptist, Methodist and Friend societies in the town. The public schoolhouses number 15, and the school property is valued at $5,575. The population in 1870 was 1,675. In 1880 it was 1,394. The valua tion in 1870 was $420,233. In 1880 it was $418,931. St. FrandS Plantation lies at the southern point of the notch in the northern border of Aroostook County. St. John Planta tion bounds it on the east. The St. John River forms the northern line, running in a north-eastern course. The St. Francis River comes in the northern side of St. John, about midway of the town. The latter river at this point broadens, and contains several islands. The plantation is connected with Fort Kent by a stage-line. St. Francis was settled by Acadian and Canadian French. It has one public schoolhouse, valued at $100. The population in 1870 was 253. In 1880 it was 299. The valuation in the latter year was $20,840. St. George is the most southerly town of Knox County. It embraces the southern and larger part of a long and broad peninsula formed by St. George's River on the west and the ocean on the east. It is bounded on the north by South Thomaston. The area is 11,026 acres. It includes Metinie, Elwell and George's Islands. Tennant's Harbor is the principal village. Others are St. George, South St. George, Martinsville and Clark's Island. At South St. George some ship-building is done ; other productions are ice and canned lobsters.

Tennant's Harbor and Port Clyde each have a marine railway."], [504, "496 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. St. George originally was a part of Cushing, from which it was set off and incorporated in 1803. It is said that two families settled in this town as early as 1635. The shores were long noted for the immense flocks of wild ducks, geese and other waterfowl that had their haunts on it, and on the adjacent islands of the bay. During Lovewell's war, in the spring of 1724, the shore of this town was the scene of a most tragic encounter between the whites and the Indians. Captain Winslow, a descendant of the Ply mouth colony governor of that name, being in charge of the fort at Thomaston, made an excursion down the St. George's for the purpose of fowling. He was accompanied by sixteen men from the garrison in two stout whale boats. A large company of Indians were in the vici nity for the same purpose, but concealed themselves, and watched the white men. As Winslow's company ascended the river the next day on their return, the Indians fired upon them from an ambush on the shore. The first boat containing Captain Winslow had been permitted to pass, and the whole fire was directed upon the rear boat under the charge of Sergeant Harvey. The sergeant fell, and a brisk fire was returned by his companions upon their assailants. Winslow, though past danger, hastened back in his boat to the assistance of his com panions. Thirty canoes full of savages immediately shot out from the shore and surrounded the two boats, commencing their assault with a horrible whoop. Every one of Winslow's brave company fell, except three friendly Indians, who escaped and communicated the sad intel ligence to the remainder of the garrison. The surface of St. George is moderately uneven. There are neither high hills nor deep valleys. Stone Hill, about 200 feet in height, is the greatest elevation. The principal rock is granite. Turkey Pond, one mile in circumference, is the largest sheet of fresh water. The woods are chiefly of spruce. The soil is a clay loam, good for potatoes, which is the crop chiefly cultivated. The principal curiosity of St. George is a cave called the \"Devil's Den,\" which has a depth of six or eight feet only. The first minister was Elder Ephraim Halt, who, with his suc cessor, Elder Benjamin Eames, was a Calvinist Baptist. There are societies of the Adventists, Baptists and Free Baptists in the town. The Baptists and Free Baptists have church edifices. The town is much given to musical entertainments by home talent. St. George village and Tennant's Harbor have each its cornet band. St. George has 16 public schoolhouses, and its school property is valued at $5,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $403,342. In 1880 it was $523,266.

Salem is situated in the eastern part of Franklin County, 7 miles from the railroad station in Strong, and nearly 20 miles from Farmington. It is bounded east by Freeman and Kingfield, south by Phillips, west by Madrid, and north by Mount Abraham township. The northern part of Salem is occupied by the southern base of the Mount Abraham group of peaks. Curvo stream, a branch of Carra basset River, takes its rise in this group of mountains ; and passing through the midst of the town, furnishes at Salem village the power for a saw and a grist-mill. Along the streams there is considerable interval land ; but elsewhere it is quite gravelly. Cobble-stones are said to abound in some parts of the town. Beech, birch, maple, cedar and spruce are found in the forests. Salem was formed from parts of Freeman, Phillips, and Number Four in the First Range, Bingham's (Million Acres) purchase. The first clearing was made by Benjamin Heath 2d from Farmington, about 1815 ; to which he and John Church 1st, and Samuel Church removed in 1817, being soon followed by Messrs. Double and Hayford. The town was incorporated in 1823 under the name of North Salem, which was changed later to the latter word of the name alone. A quaint, red, one-story building constitutes the town house, and also serves for religious meetings in the absence of a church edifice. The village has a small Sunday school library. Salem has four public schoolhouses, the total school property being valued at $400. The town valuation in 1870 was $64,432. In 1880 it was $59,868.

The principal feature of this township is the line of ponds which extend from the western side nearly two-thirds of the way to the eastern. Four of these are connected with Sandy River and form its source. Along the southern shores of these ponds passes the Sandy River road, which connects Rangeley with the railroad at 32"], [506, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 498 Phillips, about 12 miles distant. The principal settlements are along the road near these ponds. Scarcely more than a stone's throw from the most westerly of the ponds is Long Pond, a source of the An droscoggin River, \u2014 so near do the sources of these streams approach each other. The pond is situated in the middle of the woods, and is about a mile in extent, and a very pretty sheet of water. An arm of it extends within a few feet of the stage-road, which passes to the north of it. The manufactures of this plantation, so far as reported, consist wholly of lumber. The plantation takes its name from the river of which it contains the head-water. It is owned by the Oquossoc Angling Association, which was incorporated in 1870, and now numbers some seventy members. Most of these reside in the vicinity of New York City. The principal establishments of the association are on Lake Kennebago, in the second township north of Rangeley, and upon its outlet. The ponds and streams of this township abound in trout. The valuation of the plantation in 1880 was $8,400. Sanford, in York Connty, is the western portion of a tract of land purchased in 1661 by Major William Phillips of the Indian chiefs Fluellen,Captain Sunday and Hobinowell. It was confirmed by Gorges to the major or his son Nathan, in 1670. In 1696, Mrs. Phillips willed it to her former husband's son, Peleg Sanford, from whom the name is derived. It was at first called Phillipstown. Sanford was surveyed in 1734, and settlement commenced in 1740. The northern part of the town was settled in 1745 by Captain David Morrison. He purchased the lot containing the mill privileges above Springvale, and built a house and saw-mill. The record of a town meeting, held in 1770, show that the chief business of the meeting was to authorize the employment of a minister and schoolmaster for three months. The first mention of any ministerial service is that of a marriage by Rev. Peltiah Tingley, a Baptist, in 1774. Tradition says that the first preaching in town was from the top of a high rock which is to be seen on the road from South Sanford to Alfred. It is said that Louis Philippe, afterward King of France, once stopped at the Old Colonel Emery House, in South Sanford. A bed in the house is still pointed out as the king's bed. The royal heir vis ited in Maine for several weeks about 1790. The town has Alfred and Kennebunk on the east of its irregular outline, Alfred and Shapleigh on the north, Wells and North Berwick on the south, and Lebanon and North Berwick on the west. It is 10 miles long by 5 wide. The area is 17,921 acres, exclusive of water surface. Springvale, in the northern part of the town, is the principal business centre. It is on the Portland and Rochester railroad, 36 miles from Portland. Other villages are South Sanford and Sanford villages, near the centre of the town. The principal body of water is Bonny Bigg Pond. Smaller ones are Sand Pond, Picture Pond, Deering and Littlefield's ponds. The Mousam River runs through the town longitudinally, furnishing within its limits seventeen powers. On the power at Sanford village are three woolen mills and a saw-milt. Among the products are carpets, and robes and blankets for sleighs. At Springvale are the cotton factory of the Springvale Mill Company, two lumber-mills, a grist-mill, and a"], [507, "SANGERVILLE. 499 shoe factory. Springvale lies in a valley, the hills rising about it on all sides. The village derives its name from a large spring of pure water, which flows out just below the grist-mill. The numerous woods, hills and ponds afford a varied and attractive scenery. Beaver Hill and Mount Hope are the greatest eminences. The rock is granite and mica-schist. The southern portion of the town is nearly level. The soil on the ridge is fertile, but on the plains and the valleys it is inferior. The town boasts as curiosities, old Indian Cave, Wildcat's Rock \u2014 from 75 to 150 feet high and quite perpendic ular \u2014 and others. At Springvale the Calvinist and Free Will Baptists and Christians have each a church ; and the Congregationalists have one at each San ford Corner, and at South Sanford. The town has a high-school, locat ed at Springvale. The whole number of schoolhouses is fifteen, and the value of the school property is placed at $10,000.

There are 180 farms in town, each paying a yearly income of $300 or over. Sanford has a noble war record. The State gives it credit for only 147 men, but it is known to have sent over 160 into the army and 15 into the navy. Lieutenant-Colonel John Hemingway was its highest officer. The bounties paid averaged about $300. The Springvale Reporter, published eveiy Saturday, is the only newspaper in town. It is a lively sheet, devoted mostly to local news. H. C.

On the north is Guilford, Parkman forms the western boundary, and on the south is Dexter in Penobscot County. The Bangor and Piscataquis Railway passes near the north-eastern corner of the town, having a station about 7 miles from that in Dover station. North-west and Center ponds are the largest bodies of water within the town, and the Piscat aquis River forms its northern boundary. The area of Sangerville is 24,216 acres. The surface is somewhat hilly, and so elevated between the waters of the Kennebec and Penobscot that the water of its three ponds find the ocean through both these streams. The rock is lime stone and slate. There is less waste land than usual in town, most being good upland, with few stones, and easily cultivated. The prin cipal centres of business are Sangerville village, East Sangerville and Brockway's Mills. At the first, on the outlet of North-west Pond, are a grist-mill, a saw-mill, a tannery, and a woollen-mill. The latter employs about fifty hands, paying out some ten or twelve hundred dollars monthly. On the outlet of Center Pond, at Brockway's Mills, are two mills for large and small lumber; and on the outlet of Block Stream, which enters the town from Dover, are a saw-mill and shingle machine and a grist-mill. It was on this stream that the first grist-mill in town was built by Phineas Ames, the first settler. He made an opening as early as 1801 or 1802, and moved in his family in the autumn of 1803. James Waymouth was the next settler, and Jesse Brockway"], [508, "500 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. the third. The proprietor of the township was Col. Calvin Sanger, of Sherborn, Mass., who purchased three-fourths of it as early as 1800, and the remainder soon after. Eben Stevens came in 1805; in 1806 Wil liam Farnham moved his family in from Norridgewock. Mr. Farnham lived on the south side of Pond Hill, where he started the business of tanning. He brought young apple trees from Garland on his shoulders, and planted the first orchard in town. Among later settlers were Walter Leland, Samuel McLanathan, Enoch Adams, Eleazer Wood ward, Guy Carleton and Oliver Woodward. Carleton and Dudley commenced operations where Sangerville village now stands in 1812 or 1813, building there a saw-mill and a grist-mill ; and in 1816 Carle ton started a carding machine, the first in the Piscataquis valley. The township was first called Amestown, after the earliest settler, but in 1814 it was incorporated as Sangerville, in honor of the princi pal proprietor. Elder William Oakes was the youngest of several brothers who came to this town. Soon after Elder Macomber organ ized the Baptist church, Mr. Oakes was licensed to preach. A noted event in the history of the town is the loss of Daniel Ames' child. No trace of the lost one was ever found, though the entire male population searched for it more or less for days. Some months later a tramp was found carrying a child which he claimed as his own, but it was claimed and taken from him by the bereaved parents, though in several partic ulars it differed from the one they had lost. Mr. Appleford, the tramp, was prosecuted by the selectmen of the town, but witnesses providen tially at the trial vindicated the old man, and his child was restored to him, to the great satisfaction of both. The question of the disappear ance was never satisfactorially answered. There is a Union meeting-house at the village, and another at Lane's Corner. A bell has been presented to the first by Mr. Colton Brown, a wealthy farmer and a old resident. The town has a Baptist, Free Baptist and a Methodist society. Sangerville has nine public school houses, valued at $3,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $316,590. In 1880 it was $291,603. The population in the same year was 1,140.

Cape Elizabeth lies on the east, Westbrook and Gorham on the north, the latter and Buxton on the north-west, and Saco on the south east. The form of the town is nearly square, but is longest from north-west to south-east. Libby's Neck is a broadening point which extends into the sea. On the outer north-eastern side begins Scar borough Beach, about 2 miles in length. Higgin's Beech succeeds, and continues with one projection to Spurwink River. On the land, or western side of the Neck is a small harbor. Above are Pine Point and Ferry Rock, nearly enclosing from the sea a considerable basin into which are discharged the waters of the several streams of the town. These are Libby's River, which is little more than a salt water creek, running parallel with the shore from the east ; the None such River, rising in the north-western part of the town, and running almost to the eastern line of the town, then south-west to the basin ; and New River, of which Mill Creek, Beaver Beach, and Oriocoag"], [509, "SCARBOROUGH. 501 River, are branches. Scottow's Hill near the centre of the town is the most elevated portion of the surface. This was the point from which in the early period, the inhabitants signalled danger to the surrounding country, by means of beacons and signal fires. Pleasant Hill, in the eastern part of the town is a more extended eminence. Near its base on the east is a large never-failing spring; and a short distance south are two other springs having a decided mineral character. Along these streams for a considerable distance inland are salt marshes where large quantities of hay are cut annually. The occupation of the people is chiefly agricultural. The principal business centres are Dunstan Corners, Blue Point, West Scarborough, and Coal Kiln Corners. The Portland, Saco and Portsmouth railroad crosses the PKOUT'S NECK. southern part of the town, having stations at Oak Hill and West Scarborough. The Boston and Maine railway crosses a little to the south of the other, having stations at Scarborough Beech and Blue Point. The principal manufactures are of canned foods, carriages and soap. At Oak Hill is a small neighborhood library-. The first settler of Scarborough was one Stratton, who about 1630, located on a couple of islands which long bore his name. The tract of land between Black Point and Spurwink River was granted to Capt. Thomas Cammock, a nephew of the Earl of Warwick. Capt. Cammock was therefore the first legal proprietor in Scarborough. In the course of a few years other settlers joined Cammock, mostly as tenants. Blue Point and Dunstan Corners were next settled, \u2014 Richmond, Foxwell,"], [510, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 502 Henry Watts, George Deering, Nicholas Edgecomb, Hilkiah Bailey, Edward Shaw, Tristram Andrew and Arthur Alger being the earliest comers. The two latter purchased land of the Indians at Dunstan Corners, and ever held possession by virtue of that title. John Josselyn the voyager, resided here for a few years with his brother Henry, who was interested in lands, and quite a politician. When Maine was claimed to be under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, one of the articles of submission, read : \" That those places which were formerly called Black Point, Blue Point, Stratton's Island, thereunto adjacent, shall henceforth be called by the name of Scarborough ; the bound of which town, on the western side, beginneth where the town of Saco ended, and so runs along on the western side of the river Spurwink, eight miles back into the country.\" This incorporation was in 1658. The name was in remembrance of old Scarborough, in England. The Indian name was \" Owascoag,\" which signifies the place of much grass. John Libby, who settled here in 1659, or 1660, was probably the first of the name in New England. He came from Broadstairs, Kent County, England. He resided in the town until his death in 1682, becoming one of the most prominent men in the settlement. Early in the first Indian war, the savages made a descent upon Captain Scottow's garrison at the Neck, and captured it ; and the in habitants at once abandoned that locality. In 1677, two hundred friendly Indians and about forty English soldiers under Capt. Benjamin Swett and Lieut. Richardson, came to Black Point by water from Mas sachusetts. On June 29, Capt. Swett with a detachment from the vessel, together with a number of the inhabitants, swelling the force to ninety, set out to meet the Indians, who were lurking in the vicinity. In the neighborhood of the hill, they discovered a body of savages in retreat, and pursued them. The flight was a ruse, and led them into an ambush. In the desperate fight that ensued, all but thirty were left dead or wounded on the field, Capt. Swett among the number. Iu 1681 a strong fortification was erected at Black Point, but the inhabitants were so harrassed by the attacks of the Indians that Scarborough, about 1690, was wholly abandoned. The re settlement appears to have been in 1702, by a little band of seven persons, who came from Lynn in a sloop. The peace did not continue long; and in August, 1703, a band of 500 French and Indians under Monsieur Beaubarin, made a sudden descent along the coast from Casco to Wells. The fort at Scarborough was garrisoned only by the little band from Lynn. The demand for a surrender was refused ; and the enemy surrounded the fort, and commenced to run a mine under its walls. Some now began to talk of abandoning the defence ; but Capt. John Larrabee solemnly assured them that he would shoot the first man who mentioned the word \" surrender.\" Before the enemy had brought the mine near the walls a heavy rain storm came oii, soaking the soil to such an extent that the mine caved in. The workers thus becoming exposed to the fire of the garrison, were obliged to abandon tho work ; and they departed in search of easier prey. From this time, though occasionally harrassed by the Indians, the the settlement flourished. In the succeeding wars two men of Scarborough, Charles Pine and Richard Hunniwell, became famous as Indian killers. Hunniwell was especially dreaded by the savages. They had murdered his wife and"], [511, "SEARSMONT. 503 child ; and the demon of vengeance had seized upon him to such a degree that he would kill any Indian in war or peace wherever he found the opportunity. One day while mowing, an Indian endeavored ed creep upon him unawares ; but Hunniwell had seen the skulking savage, yet kept on cutting his swath toward the place of concealment. When near enough, he sprang forward, disconcerting the Indian so that his gun missed its aim, when the enraged mower at once cut off the head of the savage with his scythe. Placing the ghastly countenance upon a pole, he set it up in view of the Indians on the other side of the marsh, and in a loud voice, bade them to come on. They however, consulted prudence, and retired. Pine, at one time, discovering that the savages were holding nightly pow-wows at an abandoned barn at a distance from the settlement, concealed himself in the upper part ; and when the first two entered he shot both. The remainder fled. One James Libby had a mare of whose speed he was wont to boast. Re turning one day to the fort on horseback, but unarmed, he was pursued and overtaken by an Indian on foot, who was about to pull him from the horse, when the approach of two armed white men caused the savage to return to the woods. Libby was never afterward known to boast of the speed of his mare. After the peace of 1749, such was the demand for lumber that a dozen saw-mills were kept in operation in town. Scarborough re sponded to the call of the Continental Congress by sending 50 men to Cambridge immediately after the battle of Lexington. Many of its citizens also joined the expedition against the British at Castine, in 1779. The second parish was organized in 1734, and Richard Elvin, of Salem, a baker by trade, but converted under Whitefield's preaching, became the first minister and proved devoted and useful. Rev. Robert Jordan, an Episcopal clergyman, whose parochial charge embraced all this part of Maine,is credited with having suppressed by his intelligence and decision, the first attempt of \" the villainy of witchcraft in Maine.\" Rufus King and his half-brother William, were born in Scarborough. The former was considered a consummate orator and statesman. William belonged to the first order of energetic intellect. During his later years, he was at the head of the Democratic party in Maine. Other distinguished citizens were J. Wingate Thornton the historian, and Seth Storer, prominent in the politics of his town and state, and regarded by all parties as \" God's noblest work, an honest man.\" The Congregationalists, Methodists, Free Baptists and Christians have churches in town. Scarborough has ten public schoolhouses, and its school property is valued at $7,200. It is a port of delivery in the Saco collection district. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $705, 728. In 1880 it was $780,702. In the year 1791, its inhabitants num bered 2,235. In 1870, it was 1,692. By the census of 1880, it was placed at 1,848. ScllOOdiC Lakes, see article on St. Croix River.

The south-eastern part is very hilly, with some hills on the west also ; while a long range from Appleton penetrates the southern side nearly to Searsmont village. The town was formerly noted for its pine forests, of which it is said there was a larger quantity than in any other town of the Waldo Patent. General Knox himself carried on lumbering here. From the north-eastern side Quentabacook Pond extends nearly to the village. Its area is 1.25 square miles. This pond is the source of the east branch of St. George's River. Moody Pond, in the south-eastern part of the town, is about one half the area of the first, and discharges into that pond, through a stream and a smaller pond between. St. George's River, west branch, has its source among the hills and in the ponds of Montville. On this stream, in Searsmont, are eight water powers, and on the east branch and its tributaries are seven others. At the village are three lumber and cooperage mills, a 6ash, blind and pump factory, four carriage factories, a tannery, a boot and shoe fac tory, a coffin and bedstead factory, etc. At North Searsmont are two lumber-mills. The soil- of this town is productive and the buildings have generally the appearance betokening thrift. Searsmont is 10 miles south-west of Belfast, which is its nearest railroad connection. This town originally formed a part of the Waldo Patent. Later, it became the property of Sears, Thorndike and Prescott, wealthy Bostonians, and large proprietors of lands in this region. The first settlement was made in 1804, and the township was surveyed in 1809. It was incorporated February 5th, 1814, taking the name of the chief proprietor. A pioneer and singular character of Searsmont was known as Uncle Joseph Meservey. familiarly called \"Uncle Joe,\" who had lived to see a flourishing village grow up where seventy years before he had hunted with the red man, the moose, deer, bear and wolf.* The religious societies in town are those of the Methodists and Baptists. The public schoolhouses number twelve, and are valued at $4,000. The population in 1870 was 1,418. In 1880 it was 1,320. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $300,418. In 1880 it was $365,949. Searsport is situated at the head of Penobscot Bay on the western side of the river. It is bounded on the north by Frank fort, east by Prospect and Stockton, south by Penobscot Bay, west by Swanville and the city of Belfast. The surface of the town along the shore is quite uneven, but farther back it is more level, and many fine farms are found. Mount Ephraim, near the centre of the town, and Bog Hill are the chief eminences. The latter is about 400 feet in height. Granite or gneiss, is the prevailing rock. Much of the soil is * A writer in an old newspaper printed 30 years ago, says of \"Uncle Joe Meservey,\" then living; \" He has always preserved his youthful predilection for the forest and the stream.

A great variety of trees are found in the forests, of which quite an extent still remains. Goose Pond at the north-western corner and Half Moon, at the north-eastern are the principal bodies of water ; though there are several others in the middle and western part. There is a mineral spring in the town whose waters are claimed to be of superior efficacy. Another curiosity is a cave on the Cape. There is a good brick town hall, a story and a half in height, used for town-meetings. Union Hall is a wooden building, used for entertainments, and capable of seating 800 people. The first was built by the aid of a gift of $1,000 from David Sears, senior, formerly principal proprietor of the township. The public and private buildings in this town are generally in good repair, and the roads are excellent. There is one bridge 150 feet in length and one of 100 feet, both of stone. The manufactories of Searsport consist of a spool and block factory, a lumber and a grist mill, an iron foundry, three ship-yards, a boat-yard, and other small establishments. The nearest railroad is at Belfast, 6 miles from Sears port village. The Sanford line of steamers, connecting with Bangor, Boston and intermediate points, touch here. A stage-line connects the town with Belfast. This town was set off from Prospect and incorporated Feb. 13th, 1845. With that town, it had originally been part of Belfast. The name was chosen in honor of David Sears, of Boston, one of the pro prietors. His family retained Brigadier's Island until it acquired the new name of Sear's Island. It is now owned by David and Henry F. Sears, of Boston, great-grandsons of the first mortgagee. The area of this island is about 1,000 acres, largely covered with wood. It is two miles long and one broad, and is used as a summer residence by the family. Among the valued citizens of former days should be men tioned Jeremiah Merithew, William McGilvery, Peleg and David Nichols, Phineas Pendleton, Isaac and John Carver, Dr. Putnam Simonton, Dr. Morman, and perhaps others. There are in the town 111 persons above 70 years of age, 33 over 80, and 2 over 91. Sears port furnished 150 men for the Union army in the war of the Rebel lion, losing 53. There is a public library of 1,300 volumes, originally presented by David Sears, Sen. The Farmers' and Mechanics' Institu tion, a flourishing society of this region, holds annual fairs at Union Hall in Searsport village. The social tourist will often be surprised to find the farmer with whom he stops to chat, indulging in reminiscences of far-off regions, of hurricanes in the western tropics, and of cyclones off the Asiatic coast, and other strange and thrilling experiences of port and sea. Such incidents bring out the fact that among the inde pendent yeomen of the town are many whose early years were spent upon the sea, and some who acquired handsome properties in maritime pursuits. Often their houses will be found adorned with natural and manufactured articles of sir inge beauty from many climes; while about the grounds, as well as buildings, is the neatness born of the pride of the seaman in the trim appearance of his ship. There are in Searsport church edifices of the 1st and 2nd Congrega tional societies, of the 1st and 2nd Methodist, and of the Episcopal and Baptist societies. The town has graded schools in the village, and sometimes a high school. The number of public schoolhouses is eleven, valued at $18,450. The population in 1870 was 2,282.

Bridgton and and Naples lie on the north-east, Baldwin, on the south, and Denmark in Oxford County, and Hiram in York County, on the west. The early history of Sebao-o is blended with that of Baldwin ; the territory having been granted with the latter by Massachusetts, in 1774, to Whit temore, Lawrence, and their associates, \u2014 the survivors of John Fitch and Company. In 1826 this territory was divided, \u2014 the northern part being incorporated under the name of Sebago. About 1000 acres from Denmark was annexed in 1830 ; and 400 acres have since been added from Baldwin ; but in forming Naples, in 1834, 4,700 acres were taken from Sebago. The surface of the town is very uneven, and generally rocky. It was a severe task to clear up a farm in this rough region ; but the soil was strong and repaid the industrious with abundant crops. The building and maintaining of roads among the rocky hills and the construction of bridges over its rapid streams has always been a severe tax upon the inhabitants ; but the work has been well performed. The highest eminences in Sebago are Saddleback Mountain, on the southern border, Peaked Mountain, in the eastern part, and Tiger mountain in the north-eastern. Brown's and Perley ponds, \u2014 the largest three-fourths of a mile in length \u2014 lie within town limits. On its borders are Sebago Lake, Peabody, Great Hancock, Hancock, and South-East ponds. The principal streams are North-West River, Mill Brook and Sandy Beach Brook. The chief settlement is on Mill Brook, near the centre of the town, \u2014 constituting Sebago village. The principal manufactures are long and short lumber, shooks and boots and shoes. The town has Congregationalist, Baptist, Gen. Baptist.-, and Union churches. Sebago has nine public schoolhouses, valued at $1,600. The estates in 1870 were valued at $175,550. In 1880 they were valued at $183,095. The population at the same date was 803.

Williamsburg and Barnard lie on the north, Milo on the east, Foxcroft on the west and Atkinson on the south. The area is 22,228 acres. There are several small ponds in town. Sebec Lake lies partly within its limits, and the outlet furnishes two excellent water powers. The Piscataquis river forms its boundary line on the south. There are fine intervals along the streams, and many good upland farms. The principal manufacturing is on the outlet of Sebec Lake at the village. There are at this place a saw-mill producing large and small lumber, a cedar tub factory, a carriage and a woolen factory. South Sebec is the other village of the town.

In 1804, Mr. Pike sold one-sixteenth of this to Capt. Benjamin Wyatt, and soon after, David and Charles Coffin, Mary Pike and Philip Coombs bought equal shares, and became proprietors. Capt. Ezekiel Chase was the first clear settler. He had been a Revolutionary soldier, loved to roam the forest, and had become a successful hunter. He once took four hundred dollars worth of furs at a single hunt. In 1802, he selected his lot on the bank of Sebec River, and felled an opening. He bought of Vaughan and Merrick of Hallowell, \u2014 in whose township this point lay, being brought into Sebec by the act of incorporation. \" In 1803, he raised his first crops, cut and stacked meadow hay, built a log cabin, and in September moved his family, \u2014 the second planted in the county.\" The next summer (1804) a child was born to them \u2014 Charles Vaughn Chase \u2014 the first white child born in the county. Capt. Chase was a self taught physician, as well as soldier, hunter and farmer. He was also once honored by the Democratic party in being chosen a presidential elector. Abel Chase, a brother, was also an early settler. Among other settlers of the early period were James Lyford, Mark Trafton, Jeremiah Moulton, Peter Morrill, and N. R. Lowney, Mr. Trafton became sheriff of the county, later a military officer, and finally, a militia general. He was the father of Hon. and Rev. Mark Trafton, an eloquent and successful Methodist clergyman, and once a member of Congress. Sebec was incorporated on February 27, 1812, thus becoming the first town in the county. The warrant for the first town meeting was issued by John Whitney to James Lyford, and the meeting was held in the dwelling-house of the latter. The minister's lot was voted to Elder Asa Burnham, a Free-will Baptist, who con tinued his religious labors as long as he had the strength, \u2014 dying in 1852. Dr. Francis Boynton settled on the place still known as Boyn ton's Point, practising medicine, teaching school, and vocal and in strumental music, as opportunity offered. Some of the aged will remember his red coat on the muster field, others, the smooth tones of his clarionet in religious meetings, and others still his thorough in structions in the rude school-room. He was drowned at the rips in run ning a raft of boards from the mill down to his farm. This occurred in 1822, when he was in the 36th year of his age. The first store in the place, was opened by Mr. Towle, who soon took in Solomon Parsons as his partner. J. Lawson and son opened the second store ; and John and Nathaniel Bodwell, in 1823, started a hatter's shop. Later store-keepers have been Benjamin Gilman and brother, \u2014 who also engaged in lumbering ; and in 1832, J. W. Jewett opened still another store, being joined in the next year by Theodore Wyman. Henry Parsons was the first lawyer to open an office in the town. Hon.

Sedgwick has two companies \u2014 Eagle Brook Silver and Eggemoggin Silver \u2014 engaged in mining argentiferous galena. The latter has a capital of $200,000, and reduction works were erected a few years since at a cost of $40,000. The villages are Sedgwick, Sargentville, and North Sed wick. The town is about 24 miles south-westerly of Ellsworth, and is the stage 'line to Bucksport, which terminates at Sargentville. The town has two excellent harbors. The surface is broken and ledgy. The underlying rock is granite. A large part of the town is suitable for sheep-grazing rather than for cultivation. Along the shore of Egge moggin Reach, from Sedwick to Sargentville, the soil is easy of culti vation and quite productive. A large part of the occupation of the inhabitants is connected with the sea. Sedgwick was one of six townships granted by Massachusetts in 1761 to David March and 359 others. They were to be 6 miles square, and located contiguously between the Penobscot and Union Rivers. The grantees bound themselves to settle each township with 60 Pro testant families within six years after obtaining the king's approbation, and to fit for tillage 300 hundred acres of land, build a meeting-house, and settle a minister. In a \" census of the people of this region,\" in 1688, two French families of eight persons were' found at Naskeag Point. The first permanent settler was Andrew Black, in 1759. Four years later came Captain Goodwin Reed, John and Daniel Black, and two years after these, Reuben Gray moved in from Penobscot. His de scendants are very numerous. In 1789, the General Court confirmed to each settler 100 acres of land. The town was incorporated the same year, being named in honor of Major Robert Sedgewick. In 1817, 5,000 acres were set off to form Brooksville ; and again in 1849, about 9,000 acres were set off to form the town of Brooklin. The first minis ter of Sedgwick was Daniel Merrill. The two churches now in the town belong to the Baptist denomination. Sedgwick has 10 public school houses, valued at $5,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $197,706. In 1880 it was $188,605.

The first settlement was made in 1772, when Simeon Emery erected a saw-mill at the foot of Mousam Pond. Settlers followed so rapidly that in 1748 there were over 40 families at this point. The town was incorporated in 1785. It then included Acton which was set off in 1830 ; and in 1844, a portion of the north-west corner was annexed to Newfield. In the north and north-east, plains of sandy loam yield good crops of grass. The southern and larger part of the town consists of various elevations ranging from mere swells to precipitous hills. The soil of this portion, though stony, is fertile. The roads are good and afford many pictu resque and pleasing views. The principal trees are oak and pine. The highest elevation of land is Jo Day mountain. Little Ossipee River forms a portion of the northern boundary, and Mousam and Square ponds lie on a portion of the western line. Other ponds are Loon, Goose and Beaver. The water surface in town amounts to about 2,528 acres. Mou sam pond contains 1,760 acres ; Square, 640 ; Loon, 128. There are saw mills at Emery's Mills, Shapleigh Corner and North Shapleigh. The latter has also a woolen factory and a leather board factory. Prior to 1842, cider was largely manufactured in town, from which it may be inferred that the soil was favorable to orchards. Ross Corner at the east side, is one of the four villages of the town. The Congregationalists formed a society organization in 1823, and settled Rev. Henry A. Merrill, as pastor. A church was built soon after. Rev. Amasa Loring was ordained minister in 1842, and a new meeting-house was built. He remained but two years ; being followed by Rev. Levi Loring for one year in 1858 ; since which time there has been no settled minister. The Baptists had long held meetings in private houses and barns, when, in 1781, a society was formed. Rev. Nehemiah Davis was ordained over it in 1787 ; but he served almost gratuitously, laboring hard upon his farm through the week. He once stated that he had traveled 300 miles barefoot to preach the gospel. The society erected a meeting-house at the corner in 1862. The Methodists built a meeting-house at Emery's mills in 1828. There are now in Shapleigh two Baptist and two Free Baptist churches and one Methodist church. At a meeting of the proprietors of the township in 1778, a lot of 150 acres was assigned for the support of schools ; some years afterward the lot was sold for $1,034.18, which constitutes the local school fund. The first recorded action of the town relating to schools was in 1790, when it was voted to raise $133 for the use of schools. The town now has nine schoolhouses, and sustains for a part of the year a school called the Lindsey High-school. The school property is valued at $5,000. The town valuation in 1870 was $251,118.

A great variety of trees are found in the forests, as beech, birch, maple, hemlock, spruce, pine, cedar, elm, ash, fir, basswood, etc. The principal rock is slate ledges. The soil is loamy and productive, yielding good crops of wheat, potatoes and hay. Young as the town is, elm and maples from 10 to 25 years' growth decorate some of the streets. The general thriftiness shows itself in the neat appearance of the buildings, and the goodness of the roads. A bridge over Molunkus Stream at the village is 150 feet long, solidly built of wood and stone. Sherman has a starch factory, with a capacity of producing 200 tons of starch annually, one grist-mill running about half the year, and two saw-mills running for an equal period. The nearest railroad station is at Mattawamkeag, 25 miles distant. The climate of this town seems favorable to longevity, since there ;re three inhabitants about 80 years of age, and 21 who are over 70. Sherman sent 113 men to do battle for the Union in the war of the Rebellion, losing 34. The town has a good hall 35 by 60 feet in ground dimensions, and two stories in height. There is a public library of about 600 volumes. The Congregationalists have a good church edifice. There is a high school sustained one or more terms in each year. The number of public schoolhouses is six ; and the entire school property is valued at $2,000. The population in 1870 was 701. In 1880\"it was 798. The valuation in 1870 was $109,240. In 1880 it was $97,844. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 2 per cent. Shirley is situated on the south-western border of Piscataquis County. It is bounded on the north by township No. 5 and by Gren ville, east by Eliottsville, south by Monson and Blanchard, and west by East Moxie, in Somerset County. The town is made ap partly of the disintegrated town of Wilson. This portion of the town was origin ally No. 9, Range 9. For a time it was known as Fullcrstown, from"], [519, "SIDNEY. 511 H. W. Fuller, Esq., of Augusta, who had purchased 3,000 acres of its territories from the Massachusetts Medical Society, to which it had been granted. The surface of Shirley has many ridgy hills especially in the southern part. These generally have an excellent soil, and are valuable for agriculture. Much of the eastern part, however, is infe rior. Its river courses abound in a giant growth of pine and spruce. The main branch of the Piscataquis River rises in the township on its north, flowing southward through a bog in Shirley. This bog allows of flowage; and where the river issues from it on the south is a good water-power which is improved by a saw-mill and grist-mill. The other principal streams in town are Wilson's, at the north-eastern part, and Bog Stream, in the western part. On both of these are good powers. The western part of the present Shirley, constituting the original of the township, was purchased by Messrs. Shaw and Jabez True in 1829. The latter introduced some settlers, and built a saw mill about which the village of Shirley Mills has grown up. The first settlers were Joseph Mitchell, Eben and David Marble, who came in 1825. About the time that Mr. True began to make an opening, Capt. C. Cushman made a clearing and built a frame house in the northern part of the town ; hauling boards to cover his house on a hand sled from Monson. In 1834 the township was incorporated as the town of Shirley ; the name being that of the native place of J. Kelsey, Esq., the representative in the legislature at the time. At the first town meeting Elder Orrin Strout was chosen town clerk, and Charles Loring, one of the select-men. In 1848, the west half of what was then the town of Wilson, lying east of Shirley, was annexed to the latter. This brought in the little village known as Shirley Corner, near Wilson's Stream, with another mill privilege, a hotel, and what is now Shirley post-office. This point is on the stage-road from Dexter to Moose head Lake, and on the line of the proposed extension of the railroad be tween the same points. The Huff silver mine \u2014 expected to yield a con siderable profit \u2014 is in this town. Shirley has three public schoolhouses, valued at $1,000. The valuation in 1870 was $56,220. In 1880 it was $50,973. The population in 1876 was 206. In 1880 it was 253. Sidney, in Kennebec County, lies on the western side of the Kennebec River north of Augusta and of a small part of Manchester. Vassalboro, on the opposite side of the river, bounds it upon the east, Waterville and West Waterville in the north, and Belgrade on the west. Messalonske, or Snow Pond, separates the northern half of the town from Belgrade on the west. The town contains about 20,000 acres of land, of which a bog in the southern part absorbs about 1,000 acres. Though there are numerous streams in town, they are small ; and the several saw and grist mills are rarely able to run through the year. Agriculture forms the almost exclusive occupation of the in habitants. The soil is clay and clay loam for about 2 miles from the Kennebec ; from this line to Snow's Pond, about 2 miles, the surface is hilly and the soil gravelly. The principal crop is hay. The prox imity of the Augusta market is of great advantage to the farmers of Sidney. The rock is slate formation with granite, with some limestone, etc. A notable feature of the town is the size of its forest trees. There are several small ponds, of which Ward's Pond, at the south west of the centre, is the largest. The post-offices are Sidney, Centre"], [520, "512 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Sidney, North and West Sidney. There is no railroad in the town, but ample accommodation is afforded by the two lines of the Maine Central Railway, which pass, one along the eastern side in Vassalboro, and the other through Belgrade, on the west. The first settlements were along the river, and were made about 1760 ; and soon after there were clearings made in the vicinity of Snow's Pond. Moses Sawtelle was one of the early settlers, and his seven grown up sons soon after began their plantations about him. A distant relative, John Sawtelle, was an early settler on the river road. The climate of Sidney seems favorable to longevity, as there are at present about 50 persons in town above seventy-live years of age. The territory of Sidney was first a part of Vassalboro, but was set off and incorporated as an independent town in 1792. The Baptist church was probably the first in town. The Rev. Asa Wilbur was their pastor for many years, and in 1808 he became the first represent ative of the town in the General Court of Massachusetts. The Con gregationalists, Universalists, Friends and Methodists, each have a society and church in the town, and the Baptists and Free Baptists have two each. Sidney has nineteen school-houses, valued at $4,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $649,582. In 1880 it was $579, 764. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 2\u00a3 cents on the dollar. The poj \u2022 ation in 1870 was 1471. By the census of 1880, it is given at 1,406. Silver Ridge Plantation lies in the south-western part of Aroostook County. It is bounded on the north by Sherman and west by Benedicta. Kingman, on the European and North Ame rican Railroad, 15 miles south-east, is the nearest railroad station. The principal streams are Molunkus River and the outlet of Plunket Pond, which lies on the western line, and a short section of Macwahock River at the north-eastern corner. The surface lies much in swells and ridges, but there are no high hills. The rock underlying is slate, and the soil, a gravelly loam. Hay and grain are the chief crops, and yield abundantly. The forests contain nearly every species of Maine woods. The settlement is principally along the road from Sherman to King man. The roads are few, but quite good. There is one bridge of hemlock wood about 70 feet in length. There is one saw-mill manu facturing long and short lumber. This township received its first settler in 1858. It was formerly the east half of No. 2, Range 5. It was organized as a plantation July 20, 1863. There are three residents near ninety years of age. The plantation has three public school houses, valued at $250. The population in 1874 was 184. In 1880 it was 229. The valuation in 1880 was $16,662.

The surface is somewhat broken by swells and ridges, Bigelow Hill, the greatest elevation being about 500 feet in height. Slate rock generally underlies the soil, the latter being sandv loam, and quite fertile. Hay, potatoes and wool are the principal agricultural products. The water-power of the town is on the Kenne bee, at Skowhegan Falls, where the whole volume of the river de scends 28 feet in half a mile. An island, the head of which is at the crest of the perpendicular fall, divides the river into two channels, and serves at once as a natural pier and as a site for mills. The bottom and banks of the stream are of solid ledge, and other vast masses of rock support the dam and render it of great strength. The minimum volume of water available here in a drouth, is estimated at 110,500 cubic feet per minute for 11 hours a day, equal to 5,852 horse-powers, or sufficient for 234,000 spindles.

The streets generally are adorned with trees ; and on one old street along the river are rows of elms seventy- 33"], [522, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 514 five years old and upward. Skowhegan is on the Maine Central Rail road, 100 miles from Portland. It is connected by stage-lines with Norridgewock, Anson, Solon, Athens, the Forks of the Kennebec, and Moosehead Lake. The territory comprising Skowhegan was originally a part of Canaan, from which it was taken and incorporated under the name of Millburii, Feb. 5, 1823. In 1836, the name it now bears was substi tuted. Skowhegan is an Indian word, and is thought to signify a place of watch, referring to the habit of the savages in gathering here to catch salmon and other fish, which were abundant in their season. The original territory of the town lay wholly on the north side of the river, and contained but 19,071 acres ; but by the addi tion of Bloonifield on the south side of the river opposite, in 1861, the area was swelled to 30,981 acres. Of this number 48 acres are water, and over 321 are in roads. This town is largely indebted to Hon. Abner Coburn for its pros perity. Mr. Coburn 's father, Eleazur Coburn, moved to this locality from Massachusetts in 1792, at the age of fifteen years, being among the early settlers of the Kennebec Valley. He was a farmer and sur veyor. Abner was born here in 1803. After he became of manly age, he and his younger brother Philander, assisted their father in survey ing and exploring the 1,000,000 acres of Bingham's Kennebec purchase. The three, a little later, entered into a partnership business in land and lumber under the name of E. Coburn & Sons ; and after their father's death in 1845, his sons, the surviving partners, continued the business ; and in 1876 Philander died. He and another brother are now sole possessors of the property of the family. They own 450,000 acres of land in Maine, and several thousand in the western States. Mr. Coburn was governor of Maine in 1863. His charities have been very large of late years. Besides the gift of an elegant court-house to his native county, he has given $75,000 to Colby University at Waterville, and several gifts of smaller sums to other institutions, among which is the State Agricultural College at Orono. Other valued citizens of former years were Gen. Joseph Locke, Judah McLellan and Samuel Weston, Esqs. Col. Z. A. Smith of the \" Boston Journal,\" was for sometime a resident of Skowhegan. This town sent 285 men to the Union army in the war of the Rebellion, losing 84. There are here a society each of the Congregationalists, Baptists, Methodists, Christians and Catholics.

Smyrna in Aroostook county lies in the third range of town ships, 11 miles west of Houlton village. Ludlow lies on the east, sep arating the two towns; Merrill Plantation, on the west ; and Oakfield Plantation on the south. The stage-line from Houlton to Patten passes through the town. Duck Pond, about one-third of a square mile in area, lies north-west of the centre of the town, and its outlet is the principal stream. Another small pond lies on the south-western border, partly in New Limerick. The surface is not broken by high hills, but lies in swells and low ridges. The principal rock is white granite. The 6oil is gravelly loam, and fertile. Potatoes are the chief crop. The forest trees are spruce, hemlock, birch and maple. There is in the town one saw-mill, capable of cutting 2 M. feet of lumber per day, \u2014 100 M. per year. The settlements are chiefly in the southern portion of the town. The public and private buildings are generally in good repair, and the roads are also kept in fair condition. The nearest rail road station is at Houlton. This town was organized March 7, 1839. It furnished 6 men for the defense of the Union in the war of the Rebellion, of whom one half were lost. Among its valued citizens have been William Irish, Levi Berry and Nehemiah Leavitt.

On this stream, some 3 miles from its mouth, are a saw and lath machine. A mile below this power, is a beautiful waterfall about 20 feet in perpendicular height. The manufactures of the town are long and short lumber, meal and flour, carding and cloth-dressing, carriages, harnesses, harness pads, etc., etc. The manufacturing and other business is almost wholly at Solon Village, \u2014 which, with its stream, is certainly one of the most pleasing villages in the State. In the Kennebec, about a mile above"], [525, "SOjMERSET county. 517 the village, are Caratunk Falls, and the bay below it, \u2014 one of the pas sages most dreaded by the lumber men. The river is here compressed into a long, narrow ehan el of rock, with a broad, jagged plain of rock on the right, \u2014 where, at ., rise of the water, great masses of logs are thrown. Solon was incorporated February 28, 1809, and organized on the 27th of March following. Its plantation name was Spauldingtown, \u2014 from Thomas Spaulding, one of the grantees. The first settler was William Hilton of Wiscasset, who removed hither in the fall of 1782, \u2014 \u25a0 purchasing 500 acres of land on the river in the south-western part. He lived on this farm for 64 years, and raised a family of 13 children ; dying at 87 years of age, respected as a man of integrity and worth. The next year after Mr. Hilton's arrival came William Hunnewell, also from Wiscasset, who took a farm adjoining Hilton's. In 1787-8 Calvin and Luther Pierce, from Westmoreland, N. H., Moses Cham berlain and Jonathan Bosworth, from Easton, Massachusetts, and Eleazer Whipple and Joseph Maynard, settled on the river in the north-western part. In 1798-9, the south part was settled by James, Jonas and Nathan Jewett, from Groton, Massachusetts, and Jonas Heald and Caleb Hobart from Pepperell. A post-office was established here in 1813. The religious societies are Congregationalist and Methodist ; there is also a Union church edifice. The number of public schoolhouses is 13,\u2014 valued $3,000. The population in 1870 was 1,176. In 1880 it was 1,013. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $331,919. In 1880 it was $345,288. Somerset COllllty is one of the great central and northirn counties of Maine. It is about 135 miles in length, north and south, with an average width of some 30 miles. On its eastern line, about midway of its length, lies Moosehead Lake, 40 miles in length. Between this and the western border of the State is a chain of ponds, extending quite across the county, and discharging into Moosehead. The Ken nebec River, for fully half its length, lies in this county. In its northern part rise both the Penobscot and the St. John Rivers. The million acres of land purchased by William Bingham of Philadelphia, in the western part of the State lie mostly in Somerset. The bounds of that purchase commence at the south-eastern angle of Wellington in Pis cataquis County, extending northward on the east line of the town, and westward on its south line to the south-western angle of Mount Abraham Township, thence northward on its west line to the north western angle of No. 6 of Range 7 ; whence it runs easterly on the north line of this township to Moosehead Lake, intersecting the eastern line near the north extremity of Deer Island. The mountains of this county of present note are Mount Bigelow, on the southern border of the most western part, Squaw, Fletcher, Johnson, Pierce, Spencer, Heald, Bald, Owl's Head, Sally, Moxie, the Bald Mountain Range, Culcusso and Mucalsea mountains. The industries of this county are chiefly agricultural ; and having a good soil, few farmers fail to make a good living. Neat cattle and 6heep are raised in large numbers. Somerset County was incorporated March 1, 1809. Its territory was formerly embraced in Kennebec County ; and sections of it have"], [526, "518 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. since been taken to form Franklin and Piscataquis counties.

The town is about six miles long by three and a half wide. It contains two ponds, Patricktown or Long and James ; the first being about two miles in length, and the last a mile long and half a mile in width. The Sheepscot River, which has its origin in these ponds, furnishes a water-power here carrying a saw mill and a flour and grist-mill having three sets of stones. There are sever il other lumber-mills in the town that manufacture lumber, clap boards, shingles and laths. These mills all run two-thirds of the year. The town is about 30 miles N.N.E. of Wiscasset. It is on the stage line from Augusta to Rockland, and about 15 miles from the former. The principal eminences in town are Crummet Mountain and Dodge Hill, each about 200 feet in height. The rock is largely granitic. The soil is rocky and hard, but yields well of the crops cultivated, which are chiefly hay, potatoes, corn, oats, barley and wheat. Somerville was formerly Patricktown Plantation. It was incor porated as a town in 1858. Among the eminent citizens of the past were David and William Gilpatrick, Enoch Gove, Ichabod Marr, John Evans, Joseph Toby, Porter Dodge, Walter Wilson and Jefferson Moore.

The principal bodies of water are"], [527, "SOUTH BERWICK. 519 Knights, Cox and Warren ponds. Great Works River runs in a wind ing direction through the town, and the Salmon Falls River orms the western boundary. The business centres are at South Berwick village, on the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth railroad, at South Berwick junction, at the junction of the Boston and Maine and the P. S. & P. railroads, and at Great Works. At the latter place is the mill of the Newichawannock Company, which manufactures woolen goods at Quampheagen Falls on the Salmon Falls river, the Portsmouth Com pany manufacture cottons; the Varney Plough Company produces ploughs and cultivators, and there is also a sawing and planing mill, and a shoe factory. The first settlement in the town was at the Quampheagan Falls, the head of tide navigation, by Humphrey Chadbourne, Messieurs Shap leigh, Heard, Frost and Emery about i624. It was called the \" Parish of Unity,\" on account of the peaceful disposition of the inhabitants. The earliest title from the Indians on record is a deed to Chadbourne from the chief of the Piscataquas in 1643. Great Works has its name from the mill, containing eighteen saws, erected at the Falls in 1650 by Richard Leders. This was done in fulfilment of the conditions on which a court was held at Kittery at that date granted him exclusive right of the water-power, and all the timber not otherwise appropriated. The Indian name of these Falls was Assabumbadoc. South Berwick was included in Berwick when in 1700 that town was separated from Kittery. It was taken from the town and incorporated in 1814. Its history to the latter date will be found under the head of Berwick. During the war of the rebellion South Berwick furnished to the army over 192 men, paying bounties to the amount of $40,500. The surface is quite uneven at the north, and hilly in the southern and eastern portions. Rocky Hill is the most extended elevation, and Butler's Hill, just east of the village, commands some charming views. The woods are chiefly of oak, maple and beech. The soil in the north ern half of the town is much better than that of the southern part- The apple does well, and there are several extensive orchards. The first Congregational church of South Berwick was formed by by Rev. John Wade, who had been employed as the minister of the town. The organization was effected in 1702. The second Baptist church in Maine was formed at Great Hill in this town in 1768. It was the result of the missionary work of Rev. Hezekiah Smith, pastor of the Baptist church at Haverhill. The Baptist church at the village was organized in 1823. A Free-will Baptist church was organized in 1834, with Nathaniel Trickey as pastor. The Methodist Episcopal church -was formed in 1829 by Paul C. Richmond from the Maine Con ference. A meeting-house was dedicated in 1838 ; in 1849 it was burned and a new one was built in 1850. Berwick Academy in this town is one of the most noted in the State. It received its charter and an endowment of a township of land in 1791. The township is now the town of Athens. The present is the third building erected for the purpose of a school edifice. It is of chaste architecture, and was designed by Richard Upjohn, of New York. It is located upon a commanding site, presented by the late Benjamin Chadbourne. The grounds are adorned with hedges and shrubbery, and surrounded by a substantial wall. There is also a commodious boarding-house. The first preceptor was Samuel Moody."], [528, "520 GAZETTEER OF MAINE- The institution has received endowments from F. B. Hayes, of Boston, Benjamin T.

There is also a fund established by Hon. John Lord at his demise, called the Bible fund, which furnishes a Bible to every student who at tends a full term. The town has also thirteen public schoolhouses, and the school property exclusive of the academy is valued at $6,000. The estates in town in 1870 were valued at $818,022. In 1880 they were $864,590. The population in 1870 was 2,510; in 1880 it was 2,677. The rate of taxation is .0149. The town has one Discount and one Savings bank. Several of the noted citizens of the town and natives residing else where have already been mentioned, others are Gen. Ichabod Goodwin, who was a soldier in the last French war and in the Revolution ; Gen.

The Christian Home, an excellent religious monthly, is published in South Berwick. Soiltll port is an island at the month of Sheepscot River in Lincoln County. It was formerly a part of Boothbay, but was set off and incorporated under the name of Townsend in 1842, In 1850, this name was changed for the one it now bears. The island is about ft miles long and 2\u00a3 wide at the broadest part. At its southern extrem ity is the ancient and well-known Cape Newagen, with a small har bor and village. Another haven is Hendrick's Head Harbor, on the western side. On Hendriek's Head is a light-house. In the northern part is Southport bay, with several small harbors. Mouse, Capital and Burnt islands on the east side are parts of the town. The highest land in Southport is Pitch Pine Hill. The soil is rocky, but yields good crops of potatoes and other vegetables. As might be supposed, the the principal occupation of the inhabitants is connected with the fish eries, and catering to summer visitors. There are several good hotels. Southport is 14 miles south of Wiscasset, and 10 miles from Bath, with both of which it is connected by steamer. The Methodists have a society and church edifice in the town. There are five public schoolhouses, and these with other school prop erty are valued at $1,950. The valuation of estates in 1870 was"], [529, "SOUTH THOMASTON. 521 1149,200. In 1880 it was $132,350.

Soiltll ThOlliastOll is the most south-eastern town of Knox County, extending southward in the form of a peninsula, and into Penobscot Bay in the form of a promontory. Thomaston and Rockland bound it on the north, St. George on the south, St. George's River on the west and Penobscot Bay on the east. The surface of the the town is rough and rocky along the coast, but back some distance there are many excellent farms. Hay is the principal crop. Dean's and Perry hills, 100 to 150 feet in height, are the greatest elevations. The principal rock is granite. Eight different parties, of which one is an incorporated company, are engaged in quarrying. Westkeag River is the principal stream. Its pond, confined at South Thomaston vil lage by a dam, furnishes the chief water-power in town. It is a tide power mainly. Upon it are a grist-mill, three polishing machines for granite, and a lumber-mill. The nearest railroad stations are those at Rockland and Thomaston, each about four miles distant. Elisha Snow, who came from Brunswick in 1767, was the first set tier. He built a saw-mill on the Westkeag (Wessawaskeag) stream, near which has sprung up the village of South Thomaston. Next came Lieutenant Matthews, Richard Keating, John Bridges, and James and Jonathan Oberton. In 1773, Joseph Coombs came into the town and erected another saw-mill near Snow's; and the two soon after built a grist-mill together. Coombs was a very energetic and skilful man. At this time he was but little past his legal majority. It is told of him, that he first came to the region as a day laborer, but by his energy and prudence, soon acquired property and a wife. He met the latter at some party in the region, and both conceived a liking for each other. To visit her he was obliged to cross St. George's River on a raft. Sometimes the raft would be on the opposite side, when he would divest himself of his clothes and swim across for the raft, and return upon it for his clothes. Then dressing in the dark he would set forward in a regular manner. He prospered in love, as we have seen he did in business; and some of his descendants display his sterling qualities. Eminent citizens of a later period were Captain E. A. Thorndike, Hon. George Thorndike, Rev. Samuel Baker, Rev. Amariah Kelloch, and Hon. E. H. Murch. The Indian name of this vicinity was Wessaweskeag, which signifies a \"land of wonders.\" The name was contracted by the first settlers to \" Weskeag,\" afterward to \" Keag,\" and finally it has degenerated to \" Gig,\" which remains a familiar appellation to the present time. The Baptist church at South Thomaston is, with one exception, the oldest of that denomination between Penobscot Bay and Kennebec River, having been constituted in 1784, under the pastoral charge of Rev. Isaac Case. A meeting-house was erected by the society in 1796, which was enlarged and improved in 1847. In 1784, Elisha Snow, the first settler, was baptized, and in 1794, was settled as sub-pastor of this church. In 1808, he became senior minister, and continued thus until removed by death in 1832, at the age of ninety-two years. The Methodists also have now a meeting-house in the town.

Upper Sisladobsis Lake lies in the next township south. The surface is agreeably varied by hills, valleys and broad meadows. Wetherbee Hill is quite an eminence, having about a mile of declivity. Granite is the predom inant rock. The soil is a yellowish loam, easily worked, and yielding good crops. In 1837 when the State offered a bounty on wheat, Sam uel C. Clark of this town took the prize, having produced in that year, 1,340 bushels of wheat, besides 435 bushels of other grain. Agricul ture is still the principal pursuit, but the largest crop is hay, and many cattle are raised. Maple, beech, hemlock and spruce are the forest trees. There are several small ponds scattered over the town, the largest of which is about a mile long by half a mile in width. The Mattakeunk and Mattagordas streams have their origin in this and the adjacent towns. There are on these one cloth-mill, two grist-mills, one saw-mill for boards and other long lumber, three shin gle and one clapboard mill, the latter also making other small lumber. The town hall is a neat two-story building with a school-room in the first story. The village is in the eastern part of the town. Its streets are beautified with rows of maple from three to 20 years of age, and the houses generally are tasteful and in good repair. The town is on the stage-line from Lincoln to Calais. The nearest railroad station is that on the European road at Lincoln, some 15 miles distant. This town received its first settlers in 1030. The north half of the township was granted to Foxcroft Academy, and by its trustees sold to Bangor parties for thirty-one cents an acre. It was then heavily timbered with pine and spruce, immense quantities of which have been taken from it ; and there are large tracts of heavy wood still remaining. The south half was sold in smaller quantities by the State settlers and others, and is said to contain some of the best land in Maine. James Butterfield was the first trader. Other esteemed citizens have been Elias Breck, Elder Lewis, Azro Clark, B. H. Scribner and others. The number of old people, some about 90 years of age, speaks well for the wholesomeness of the climate. Springfield has Congrega tionalist, Free Baptist and Methodist societies, and a large and small church edifice.

It con- tains territory, including an island and part of Lake Sebago, equal to eight miles square. Standish is bound on the north by Lake Sebago, south-east by Windham and Gorham, south by Buxton and Hollis, and west by Limington. The Saco River separates it from the towns of York County on the west. At the north-eastern extremity of the town called Standish \" Neck,\" is the Basin of Lake Sebago, from which issues the Presumpscot River. The Portland and Ogdensburg railway passes through the town along the southern extremity of the lake. The stations are Sebago Lake, Richville and Steep Falls. Much of the land is sandy plains, formerly covered with pines; yet there is con- siderable good farming land. The highest eminence is Oak Hill. The principal bodies of water in the town are Great and Little Watchig, Bonny Eagle, and Rich's Mill Pond. The chief business centres are Standish Corner, Steep Falls, and the adjoining villages of South Standish and Bonny Eagle Island. Lesser points are Wescott Falls, at the Basin, and Sebago Lake, which is a railway station and a point of departure for the lake steamers and other boats. The manufactures are lumber, headings, shooks and staves, carriages, clothing, flour and meal, ice, plaster, packing-boxes, etc ; each of the villages having one or more mills or factories for producing these articles. The township which is now Standisll was granted in 1750 to Capts. Humphrey Hobbs and Moses Pearson and their companies for services in the siege of Louisburg. The whole number of grantees was to be 120, sixty of whom were to settle in distinct families within three years, and sixty more within seven years. They were to give bonds to the treasurer of the province that each man should build a house sixteen feet by eighteen, with a seven foot shed, and clear up five acres of land. The settlement commenced in 1760. Rev. John Thompson, the first minister, was ordained in 1768."], [532, "524 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. The plantation was called Pearsontown. The inhabitants did not apply for incorporation until some years after it had the requisite number of inhabitants ; and one day in 1783, they were almost petrified by a message from the Massachusetts House of Representatives requir ing the plantation to show cause why they should not be incorporated as a town. But when the House soon after ordered an assessment of taxes upen the plantation for the last twenty years, the inhabitants responded in a appeal whose earnestness was not surpassed by the remonstrances of the colonies against the mother country. They also asked for incorporation. The appeal caused the law-makers to relent so far as to abate \u00a3571, 18s. from the sum previously ordered. The town was incorporated in 1785, and is said to have been named for that redoubtable Plymouth hero, Miles Standish. In 1806, Edward Mussey was sent to the legislature, being the first representative. The Congregationalists, Unitarians, and Free Baptists, each have a church, and the Methodists two, in this town. Standish has thirteen public schoolhouses, valued at $5,800. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $492,709. The population at the same date was 2,089. The census of 1880 places it at 2,037. StarkS lies in the south-western part of Somerset County, bordering on Franklin. Anson bounds it on the north, Norridgewock on the east, Mercer on the south, and Industry on the west. The sur face is generally level, but there are a few hills, among which Mount Hunger and Maple Hill are the highest, having an elevation of about 600 feet. The rock is granitic in character, with some \"blue ledge.\" The soil is a rich clayey loam. General farm crops are cultivated, and do remarkably well. Nearly all species of Maine trees are found in the forest in due proportion, except pine. Sandy River forms a part of the southern line of the town, and runs northward across the eastern \u00a3art to the Kennebec, which forms a part of the line on the north-east. emon Stream, which furnishes the principal water-power, enters at the north-west and discharges into Sandy River at the south-east. Starks Village is situated on this stream in the western part of the town, where, also, are the manufactures. These are a saw-mill for long and short lumber, shingle-mill, grist-mill and carriage and pump factory, The nearest railroad station is 7 miles distant. Starks is 14 miles from Skowhegan on the stage-line from Temple Mills. The first settler was James Waugh, who had previously resided for several years in Clinton. Hearing \"that the New Plymouth Company were making liberal offers for new settlers, he in 1772, with knapsack, dog and gun started up the Kennebec in pursuit of a farm. He as cended as far as the mouth of Sandy River and selected a lot near it. In 1774 he returned with three of his neighbors and their families. So rapidly did this settlement increase that in 1790 there were 327 persons within the township. Starks was incorporated Feb. 28, 1795, being named for the hero of Bennington. Its area is 17,154 acres, of which 363 acres are in roads. Among the valued citizens of this town in time past were Stephen Williamson, Leonard Greaton, James Varnum, William E. Folsom, Asa Chapman, Joseph Witham, Stephen Green leaf, Samuel Chapman, Abijah Joy, William Frederic, and others. Starks sent about 75 men to do battle for the Union during the war of the Rebellion, one-third of the number being lost. The church edifices here are the Methodist and the Union.

This river, through out its whole length forms the boundary line between the territories of the United States (as well as of Maine) and Great Britain. It extends from Passamaquoddy Bay to near the middle of the eastern line of Maine, continuing its somewhat tortuous course through Schoodic or Grand Lake and North Lake to the L-iroe monument, which marks N. latitude 45\u00b0 56' 36.8\" on the boundary. St. Croix or Neutral Island, also called Docket's and De Mont's Island, lies opposite Robbinston, in the middle of this river. The area probably does not much exceed six acres,yet it is important from being on the dividing line between the two nations, which follows the middle of the river. It was early noted from having been the residence of the colony of Pierre De Monts, the French explorer, in 1604r-1605.* Apprehending danger from the savages he erected a fortification upon some high ground at the north part, which commanded the river and island. Traces of this were found in 1798 by the commissioners appointed by the two nations to settle the boundary, and served an important purpose in fixing the line in this vicinity under the treaty- of 1783. There was a lighthouse erected upon this island in 1856, which is maintained at the pres ent time.' It is opposite Red Beach in Robbinston. It stands first in the list of United States lighthouses. Upon the final settlement of the boundary, the British government relinquished all claim upon this island. At the date of 1858 one half of it belonged to the heirs of Stephen Brewer and the other to the United States. Steep JFallS, \u2014 a post-office in Standish, Cumberland County.

The surface is not very uneven generally, but has several eminences of some 350 feet in height, as Roger's Mountain and Clark's and Wiggin's hills. The soil is gravelly loam, and quite fertile. The largest crops raised are hay and potatoes. Beech, birch and maple constitute the woods, but the original growth was pine. Stetson Pond, lying near the centre of the town, is the largest sheet of water, being three miles long by one-half a mile wide. There is another sheet of water which is regarded as some what curious, being a mill-pond on a hill. The village is a little to the north-west of Stetson Pond, on its outlet. There are here and elsewhere in the town three saw-mills, a grist-mill, Stetson cheese factory, a carriage-factory, etc. A smaller centre of business is East Stetson post-office, at the eastern end of the pond.

On the east is Narraguagus River and Bay; on the south the sea, on the west Gouldsborough Bay and Steuben Harbor. At the head of the latter is Steuben village, the largest in the town. Others are at the head of Dyer's and Pigeon Hill bays, in the southern part of the town. These two bodies of water are separated by Pigeon Hill, at whose ex tremity is Petit Manan Point. Pigeon Hill is situated at a narrow place on the upper part of the peninsula; and opposite on the western side of Dyer's Bay, is East Hill. Dyer's and Gouldsborough bays are separated by Dyer's Neck. Tunk Stream, which enters at the north ern part of the tow-n and empties into Steuben Harbor, is the principal water-course within this town, and above the village furnishes power for a saw-mill and a grist-mill. The manufactures are carriages and sleighs, staves, lumber, meal and flour, etc. This town is 36 miles west by south-west of Machias, and is on the Ellsworth and Cherryfield stage line. The surface is quite uneven, and the soil rocky. The occupations of the people are seafaring, farming and lumbering, in proportion accord ing to the order mentioned. There are in this town two mining com panies, bearing the names of Petit Manan Silver Co., and Steuben Sil ver Mining Co. Steuben was No. 4, of six second-class townships granted in 1762 by Massachusetts to an association of petitioners ; but these having failed to fulfill the conditions, it reverted to the State, and was on August, 26, 1794, granted to Thomas Ruston.

On the opposite side of the river are Wetmore Isle (Verona), Orland and Penobscot. The area is about 18 square miles, with 8 miles of shore. The surface is generally level, and without a high hill. The rock is generally granitic in character ; and the soil, though rocky, is productive. The forests are of rock maple, beech, birch, spruce and some hemlock. The streams are small, and there are no considerable ponds. The manufactures consist of Stock ton shoe factory, Stockton and Prospect cheese factory, a door, sash and blind, lime-cask and fish-barrel and clothing factories. The post offices are Stockton and Sandy Point. The town is about 10 miles north-east of Belfast, on the stage-line to Bangor. The buildings in this town are in very good repair, and the roads and bridges in fine order. There are good harbors at Sandy Point, Fort Point Cove and Cape Jellison. The latter is a large Peninsula extending southward. Fort Point is a smaller peninsula extending eastward from Cape Jellison, now occupied by an excellent hotel for summer visitors. The Indian name was Wasaumkeag. The point has its present name from the fort built here by Governor Thomas Pownell in 1759. The site is about 25 rods from the waters edge, where some vestiges are still to be found. This fortification was in form of a square, the east side facing the water, and at each corner were flankers. The dimensions were 300 feet, or 90 feet on each inner side of the breastwork, which was 10 feet in height. This was surrounded by a moat or ditch 15 feet wide at the top, 5 at the bottom and 8 in depth. Each exterior side of the ditch, or the glacis, was 240 feet. In the middle of the ditch were palisadoes quite around the fort, except at the portcullis, or entrance, at the eastern side, where a drawbridge crossed the ditch. In the ditch at the foot of the wall was a line of pickets. Between the fort and the river were the houses of the commander and others, Indian attacks being usually from the mainland side. Within the walls was a square block-house, 44 feet on aside, with flankers at each corner, of diamond form, 33 feet on a side. The whole was constructed of squared timber, dove-tailed at the corners, and treenailed. The height of the block-house, in two stories, was about 22 feet, the roof was square or hipped, and had a sentry box upon the top. On the roof was mounted several cohort mortars ; and on the area between the breastwork and walls ot the block-house 20 feet in width, three or four cannon were mounted. The upper story of the breast-work jutted over the lower about three feet, the space being covered with loose plank, easily removable. The lower story was used as barracks : and in the upper one, where 10 or 12 small cannon were mounted, garrison exercise was performed in stormy weather. There were two chimneys, one in the north-west and one in the south west corner. After the war,* there was a large trade carried on for many years between the gartison and the Indians. An aged gentleman says \" I have seen one of the flanker-rooms as full as it could well be stowed with the first quality of furs, beaver, otter, sable, &c.\" Soon after Majorbigtiyduce (Castine) was occupied by the British A.D., 1779, Colonel Cargill came from Newcastle, and burnt the block house and curtilage; and subsequently by order of government, he again appeared at the head of a party, and labored iudefatigably till almost exhausted with toil * See article on Civil History iu the first part of this work."], [536, ""], [537, "STOW. 529 and hunger, in filling the ditches and levelling the breastwork.

Its extreme length north and south along the border is upwards of 10 miles, and its greatest width about 3\u00a3 miles. This town embraces nearly the whole of the beautiful Cold River valley, that stream running the whole length of the town and emptying into Charles Pond. The latter lies in the north angle of Fryeburg which notches the southern line of Stow for its whole extent. On the south-east side of the town lies Upper Kezar Pond, into which Charles Pond discharges its waters by means of Charles River. The other principal stream is Little Cold River, emptying into the larger stream near the south line of the town. Stow Corner and post-office, the chief business centre, are situated near this stream a short distance above its mouth. In the north-eastern part is a large elevation with two peaks, but bearing no name on the town map. The manufactures of this town consist of saw-mills, a grist-mill, a carriage-factory and smithy. Stow is 30 miles west by south-west of Paris, and 11 miles from Fryeburg. It is in the region which the Pequaket tribe of Indians formerly possessed. The settlement by the English was commenced in 1770. The original settlers were Isaac, James, Micah and Simeon Abbott, from Andover, Mass., William Howard, of Keene, N. H., and Samuel Farrington of Fryeburg, Me. The Abbotts obtained their land titles in part from the proprietors of Fryeburg, in part from William Steele, of Concord, N. H., and in part from Judge Phillips, of Andover Mass., and Mr. Howard obtained his from Jonathan Robinson of Fryeburg. Stow was incorporated as a town January 28, 1833.

Strickland's Ferry,\u2014 a post-office and railroad station in East Livermore, Androscoggin County. StrOllg\" is situated near the centre of the settled portion of Franklin County. It is bounded on the east by New Vineyard, south by Farmington, west by Temple and Avon, and north by Freeman. The dimensions of the territory are 7 miles from north to south and 5 from east to west in the northern half and three in the southern. Sandy River enters the town near the middle from the west, soon taking an almost right-angled turn southward through a valley in the range of mountains running from Weld through Avon, Strong and New Vineyard. The rocks are slate, granite, and mica-schist.\u00b0 The soil along the river is sandy loam, and clayey loam on the uplands, and is strong and fertile. The principal crops are hay, wheat, corn, oats and potatoes. Porter and Bates ponds are the principal sheets of water, the first being one and a half miles in length by three-fourths of a mile in width. The town is very hilly; Day's Mountains, standing partly in Avon, being the highest elevation. Strong village is nestled down among the hills just north of the bend in Sandy River, which is here crossed by an iron suspension bridge."], [539, "SULLIVAN. 531 The village contains several fine residences, and is one of the prettiest in the county. There are good powers on Sandy River, upon its north east branch, and on the outlet of Porter's Pond. On the last are a saw-mill and clover mill. At Strong village are a machine shop, boot and shoe factory, and that of the Sandy River Cheese Company, a manufactory of clothes-pins, cane-seat chair bottoms and excelsior. The village is situated on the Sandy River narrow guage railroad from Farmington to Phillips. The first settlements in Strong were made as early as 1784, by William Read, followed by Edward Flint, John Day, David and Joseph Humphrey, Jacob Sawyer, William Hiscock, Benjamin Dodge, Timothy Merry, Eliab Eaton, Peter Patterson, Robert McLeary, Jere miah Burnham and a Mr. Ellsworth, all from Nobleborough, or its vicinity. Richard Clark and Joseph Kersey became residents about 1792. This township was purchased of the State of Massachusetts by an association, of whom William Read was one, and acted as their agent in the purchase and survey of the town. The inhabitants were for some years under the necessity of carrying their corn and grain to Winthrop to mill, or of using their mortars instead. This town claims to have been the birth-place of the Republican party. The Methodists and Congregationalists each have a church in the town. Strong has seven schoolhouses, valued together with other school property at $2,225. The town valuation in 1870 was $220,794. In 1880 it was $223,525. The population in 1870 was 634.

Sullivail, in Hancock County, is situated on the eastern side of Taunton Bay, an extensive inlet of Frenchman's Bay. Within the limits of the town are eight islands, named as follows : \u2014 Capital A., Bean's, Drum, Preble's, firagdon, Burnt, Black, and Seward. The area of the town is 17,500 acres. The surface is very uneven, yet the soil is generally good. Hay and potatoes are the crops chiefly sought ; but the land in general is best suited for grazing. The principal inland sheets of water are Flander's, Morancy, Long and Round Ponds. The outlets of the first two ponds, and Gordon's and Simpson's streams, afford power for mills. Sullivan has long been noted for the first-class coasters constructed in its ship-yards, and for its immense deposits of granite and syenite, The granite contains beautiful veins of felspar green, is of superior quality, splits well, may be wrought into almost any shape, and is suitable for any building. The chief industry of the town now centres in quarrying and mining. Along the shore of Sul livan River, and nearly parallel to it, is located the famous Sullivan lode, which is considered one of the most remarkable silver-bearing veins that has ever been discovered. On this vein several companies are operating. \" The country rock in which the vein is found is a slaty quartzite, somewhat talcose, and in some places calcareous and, occasionally porphyritic.\" Almost every ore of silver is separated in this vein, native silver, argentite, stromeyrite, pyrargyrite, stephanite, and cerargyrite and the black sulphuret, the last predominating. There are now eleven incorporated companies owning mines in the town, most or all of them being operated. Work has been done also in five"], [540, "532 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. or more unincorporated mines. There has been completed in the vicinity a concentrating mill and smelting works for reducing silver ore. On the various streams there are two saw-mills, two stave mills, one shingle-mill, and one grist-mill. Sullivan is 13 miles S. S. W. of Ellsworth, on the stage-line from Ellsworth to Cherryfield. A steamboat touches at Sullivan Falls three times a week. Sullivan, while a plantation, was called New Bristol. The Indian name was Waukeag, their name for the seal. Settlements were com menced in 1762, by Sullivan, Simpson, Bean, Gordon, Blaisdell and Card. The township had been granted to David Bean and associates in 1761, by the colonial government of Massachusetts, but the King refusing to confirm the grant, the settlers were in 1803 confirmed in the possession of 100 acres each by Massachusetts on the payment of $5. The town was incorporated in 1789 under the name of Sullivan in honor of one of the original settlers. At Waukeag are evidences of an old French settlement. In 1841, an earthen pot, containing some what more than $400 in French coin was dug up. They bore the date of 1725. At the commencement of the Revolutionary war half the settlers moved back to York,reducing the families in the plantation from forty to twenty. Nine thousand acres of land in this town were, after its incorporation, given to Bowdoin and Williams colleges. Sullivan furnished 80 men to the Union forces in the war of the Rebellion. The Baptists and Methodists each have a church in town. The number of public schoolhouses is six, and the school property is valued at $5,000. The valuation of real estate in 1870 was $141,954. In 1880 it was $193,477. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 1^ per centum. The population in 1870 was 796. In 1880 it was 1,023. Slimiier lies on the eastern part of the middle portion of Oxford County. It is bounded by Peru on the north, Hartford on the east, Buckfield on the south, and Woodstock and Paris on the west. The greatest length of the town is north-west and south-east about 11 miles ; and its width averages nearly 5^. Through almost the whole length of the town runs the West Branch of Twenty-Mile River, and the East Branch of this river forms the eastern boundary line. Near this river at the north-east is Labrador Pond, west of the centre is Pleasant Pond, and in the south-eastern part of the town is North Pond, largest of the three, having an area of about one-third of a square mile. Smaller are Shag Pond in the north-west comer, and Little Labrador in the eastern part of the town. Black Mountain, noted for its blueberries, is an extensive elevation in the northern part; and Spence Hills on the south-western line. Cushman's Hill, south of the centre, and Hedgehog Hill in the south-east, are also considerable elevations. The surface generally- is uneven and broken, but the soil is generally productive. At Jackson Village (West Sumner post-office) are a saw-mill for long lumber, a shingle-mill, grist-mill, cooperage, etc.; and at East Sumner are saw, shingle and grist-mills, and various small manufactures. The main business of th inhabitants is agricultural, in which they have met with good sue- 'ss, and the town generally bears the appearance of thrift. The 1 imford Falls and Buckfield Railroad touches the south-eastern part of the town, and has a station near East Sumner. The Grand Trunk railroad station at West Paris is about 8 miles from Sumner Centre. This town was formerly one with Hartford ; and these sections"], [541, "SURRY. 533 bore respectively the names of East and West Butterfield. On June 13, 1798, it w.as separately incorporated under its present name in honor of Governor Increase Sumner. The first settler in town was Charles Bisbee, from Pembroke, Mass. The first settlement in the south-cast part was made in the same year by Increase Robinson and Noah Bosworth. Most of the first settlers came from Plymouth County, Mass., and were Revolutionary soldiers. Among the \"earliest were Increase and Joseph Robinson, Simeon Barrett, Noah Bosworth, Hezekiah Stetson, John Briggs, John Crockett, Benjamin Heald, Mesech Keen, Barney Jackson and Oliver Cummings. These obtained the titles to their lands from Massachusetts. Oliver Cummings, from Dunstable, Mass., struck the first blow of the axe at what is now the centre of the town. For some years the settlers were obliged to carry their grist upon their backs ten miles to a mill in Turner, being guided by a spotted line through the woods. The first grist as well as the first saw-mill in the town was erected by Increase Robinson. The churches in Sumner are a Congregationalist, First and Second Baptist, Free Baptist and Universalist. The public schoolhouses num ber sixteen, and the entire school propertVhas an estimated value of $4,600. The population in 1870 was l,i70. In 1880 it was 1,014. The valuation in 1870 was $382,463.

On the north east it is bounded by Ellsworth, on the south-west, by Blue Hill, on the west, by Orland and Penobscot. The town has an area of about 21,025 acres. Toddy Pond forms part of the boundary between Surry and Penobscot, and on the line between Surry and Ellsworth are the two Patten ponds whose outlet is Patten Stream Fishwavs were constructed to these ponds in 1872, and the ponds have since been stocked with alewives and salmon. The surface of the town is considerably broken. The land generally is valuable for tillage. The most of the surface soil is so intermingled with com minuted quartz, or siliceous sand, that cranberries grow in the grass fields. The cultivation of this crop is receiving increased attention. A large deposit of nearly pure silica in the town may prove of much value for glass and other ware. Over miles of surface on the Toddy Pond road lav, a few years ago, a bleak profusion of granite bowlders, To-day those bowlders are seen in every stage of ruin. On every hand they are smitten with decay, and here and there a patch of unworn gravel is all that remains of a once great bowlder. A few miles beyond these, is a field of immense bowlders, still uncrumbled, lying in wild confusion bowlder on bowlder, \u2014 \" The fragments of an earlier world.\" The manufactories of Surry are a lumber, shingle, spool and two stave mills. Formerly there was a large business done in building small vessels, but it is now very much reduced. Surry has two mining companies, the Blue Hill Bay and the East Surry Company. Surry was Township No. 6, in the grant to Marsh and others. It was first occupied by the French at Newbury Neck. The first English settlers were Symonds, Weymouth and James Flye. The next settlers were John Patten, a Mr. Hopkinson, Andrew Flood, Wilbrahim Swett, Matthew and James Ray, Samuel Joy, Isaac Lord, Hezekiah Coggins and Leonard Jarvis. Mr. Jarvis represented the eastern dis trictrin Congress from 1831 to 1837."], [542, "534 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Up to 1820, about 13,000 acres had been secured to settlers and by quiet possession titles, when Mr. Jarvis bought the remainder. In 1800, Surry included that portion of Ellsworth known as Ward 5 ; but in 1829 it was re-annexed to Ellsworth. There was a population of 239 as early as 1790. In 1874, a small quantity of silver coin was found at Weymouth Point. Surry furnished 135 men to the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion. The Baptist, Free Baptist and Methodist denominations have churches ki town. There are nine public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $3,400. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $209,13*7. In 1880 it was $177,534. The population in 1870 was 1,242. In 1880 it was 1,185. Swan'S Island PantatiOn, in Hancock County, is situated south-west of Mount Desert Island and east of Deer Isle, being about equally distant from each. It has communication with Tremont, on Mount Desert, by boat. The soil is very rocky, but pota toes and hay yield fair crops. The rock is granite and a gray rock containing gold and silver ore. A mining company has recently erected a crushing mill. Fish-barrels, oil-cloths and boats are the prin cipal manufactures. The Methodists and Baptists each have a society and preaching on the island.

It is bounded north by Monroe, east by Frankfort and Searsport, south by Belfast city, and west by Waldo and Brooks. The middle and north ern parts of the town are quite hilly. Swan Lake (Goose Pond on the State map), in the north-eastern part is about three miles long and a quarter wide. Toddy Pond, at the north-western corner, is about one fourth of a square mile in area. In the southern part are three other ponds still smaller. There is no large village in the town. The indus tries are chiefly farming, brick and soap-making, and quarrying paving stone. This town was a part of the Waldo Patent, and was formerly known as the plantation of Swan. Petition was made in November, 1816, by James Leach and thirty-seven others, for incorporation as a town. The petition set forth the fact that the plantation had 100 rateable polls, 56 legal voters, and 58 soldiers enrolled in the militia; and that Mr. Sullivan, the proprietor, had appointed an agent to make convey ance to settlers, and that many purchases had recently been made, and that the settlement was rapidly increasing. The petition was allowed, and the town incorporated February 19th, 1819. The Methodists and Baptists have societies in Swanville, and each has a resident minister. There are six public schoolhouses, valued at $1,725. The population in 1870 was 770. In 1880 it was 703. The valuation in 1870 was $140,050. In 1880 it was $138,338.

Waterford forms the north-east ern boundary, Lovell the north-western, and Fryeburg the south-west-"], [543, "TEMPLE. 535 4 ern. The surface of the town is somewhat broken, and there are three high hills. These are Winn's in the north-eastern part, Popple, in the north-western and Black Mountain in the south-western. In the south eastern part is Steven's Pond, about one square mile in area, with three smaller ponds connected. Keyes Pond in the northern part of the town, discharging into Kezar River, and three smaller ponds, discharg ing into Moose Pond, form a line of ponds north and south across the midst of the town. The manufactures consists of a saw-mill for long and short lumber and shooks, and a carriage factory. The town is about 21 miles south-west of Pans, and is the terminus of the mail-line from Fryeburg. Sweden formed a part of the grant made by Massachusetts to Cap tain Lovewell's company in the memorable fight with the Pequaket warriors in Fryeburg. The first settler was Samuel Nevers, from Bur lington, Mass., in 1794. In the two following years came Benjamin Webber from Bedford, Jacob Stevens, from Rowley, Andrew Wood bury and Mieah Trull, from Tewksbury, and Peter Holden, from Mai den, Mass. Nevers and Trull, Mrs. Holden and Mrs. Woodbury were still living in January, 1857 ; Nevers being 91. At the age of 17 he shipped in the Rider-Rally, Captain Baldwin, a vessel fitted out in Boston during the Revolutionary struggle as a privateer, which was captured by the British brig Chatham.

The rock is of a granite charac ter, and grayish in color. The soil is a light loam. Most of the usual farm crops are about equally cultivated. Nearly all the wroods com mon to Maine flourish in the forests. West Musquash Lake, 7 miles long and 3 wide, lies across the western border. The outlet of this pond is the principal stream. There is in the town a saw-mill for long lumber, and a shingle-mill, manufacturing about 2,000,000 of shingles annually. The nearest railroad station is at Princeton, 10 miles distant. This town was incorporated February 8th, 1875. There is a gran ite monument 15 feet in height to the fallen soldiers of the Union.

The middle of the town is not greatly uneven, but the base of the Blue Mountain range intrudes somewhat upon the northern border. There are two high hills in the north-east ern part of the town, and a long elevation along the western side. Averill Mountain, a little south of the centre of the town, is the highest peak. The prevailing rock is red sandstone. The soil is loamy, and formed in a great measure from the rock. Maple, beach and birch constitute the greater part of the woods. Good crops are raised of hay, wheat, corn, potatoes, oats, beans and apples. The town is excellent for grazing, and is noted for the excellence of its sheep. Of the four con siderable ponds in town, the largest is Farnnni Pond, 2 miles long and 1 wide, and the next Drury Pond, about one-half as large. Temple Stream, rising among the mountains in Avon, runs southward across the eastern end of the town, furnishing the principal water-power. Temple Mills situated on Temple Stream, in the south-eastern part of the town, is the principal ousiness -centre. There are here, or nearby, three saw mills, an excelsior and stave-mill, a grist-mill, and a carriage factory. Temple is 5 miles from Farmington, which furnishes its nearest rail road communication. Tho streets in the vicinity of the village are well shaded with maple and elm, and pleasant residences abound. This town was formerly known as Number One of Abbott's purchase. The first settlement was about 1796, by Joseph Holland and Samuel Briggs. They were scon followed by Thos. Russell, James Tattle, Moses Adams, John Kenney, Jonathan Ballard, William Drury, Asa Mitchell, Samuel Lawrence, Gideon and George Staples. At the commencement of its settlement Temple was owned by Benjamin Phillips, of Boston, but was surveyed and settled under the ageney of Jacob Abbott, of Brunswick, who subsequently purchased the residue of Mr. Phillip's eastern lands.

The lat ter, with Weskeag Stream, Mill River and Oyster River, are the prin cipal streams. The surface of the town is gently undulating. The soil is clay and loam The usual crops are successfully cultivated, and there are many excellent farms. The forest trees are generally of soft wood. Thomaston village -is pleasantly situated a little eastward of the great bend of the St. George's, on a bay-like expansion of the river. Along its broad, well-shaded streets, are many handsome and costly residences. The State prison is a conspicuous object, consisting of a high wall enclosing several acres of ground, and including an aban doned lime-quarry. Its principal buildings are of brick and stone, and"], [545, "THOMASTON. 537 are of form and solidity well suited to their several uses. Within its walls are manufactured boots, shoes, harnesses and carriages. The building was begun in 1824. At the village and elsewhere in the town are two grist-mills, two steam saw and planing mills, one boat builder, three sail-lofts, nine patent lime-kilns, several ship-yards, brick yards, etc. Lime has been manufactured here since 1734. The manu facture of marble slabs from the lime-stone was commenced here by Mr. Dwight, in 1809, and in 1825 there were two mills and factories devoted to it, in which 200 saws weie in motion. Thomaston was the heart of the Muscongus, afterward known as the Waldo Patent. As early as 1630 a trading-house was erected by the proprietors on the eastern bank of the river, for the purpose of traffic with the natives. No attempt was made to settle it for nearly a century subsequent to that period. In order to encourage settlers, the proprietors erected in 1719-20, two strong block-houses ; and the old trading-house, situated directly in front of where the residence of Gen eral Knox since stood, was remodeled and made into a sort of fort. They also built a double saw-mill, on a stream ever since known as Mill River, erected thirty frames for dwellings, and maintained a gar rison of 20 men, under command of Capt. Thomas Westbrook. The Indians regarded this settlement as an unwarrantable encroachment upon their rights, and protested ; in reply to which the English as serted that the territory had been sold to Sir William Phips, and the deed signed by Madockawando and Sheepscot John. But the Indians declared that these chiefs were not Penobscot Indians, one belonging to Machias and the other in the vicinity of Boston ; consequently, that they had disposed of what did not belong to them. Failing to per suade or frighten the English to abandon their designs, the Indians determined on attacking the infant settlement. The government sent down a force of 45 men with cannon and the necessary munitions of war. On the 15th of June, 1722, the Indians made their descent upon the place, burning the saw-mill, setting fire to a sloop in the harbor, and destroying all the houses and frames that had been erected but a short time before. A vigorous assault was then made upon the block houses, and it was with great difficulty that the garrison saved them from destruction. The Indians retired, but in the July following, re newed the attack ; vigorously pressing the siege for 12 days. The besiegers had made considerable progress in undermining one side of the fort, quite to the alarm of the garrison, when heavy rains came on, causing the banks of the trenches to cave in upon the miners and forcing the savages to abandon the siege. The loss of the Indians in this attack was 'Z0, and that of the garrison was but 5. On the 28th of December, 1723, they made another onslaught upon the fortress, continuing the siege for 30 days ; at the end of which time Captain Westbrook, who had previously been succeeded in the command of the place by Captain Kennedy, came to the rescue, and put the Indians to flight. Another, but unsuccessful attempt was made the next year. In 1735, a company of 27 persons, by arrangement with Waldo, set tled on St. George's River ; and in 1740 he erected a grist-mill upon the river, a proof that the settlers were raising sufficient grain to sup ply themselves with bread. Yet harrassing conflicts with the Indians interrupted the progress of the settlement for some time after. Noth ing here seemed permanent until the arrival of Mason Wheaton, who settled on Mill River, in 1763."], [546, "538 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Thomaston was incorporated in 1777, and included, until 1848, Rockland and South Thomaston. It was named for Maj. Gen. John Thomas, of Massachusetts, a brave officer who died in the preceding May, at Chambley. Mason Wheaton, before mentioned, a connection of General Thomas, was a colonel in the army of the Revolution, and the first representative of Thomaston, in the General Court. Another notable citizen was John Paine, a most enterprising trader, who, in the single year of 1820, paid $170,000 duties on imports. Mr. Healy was an extensive ship-builder. David Fales, physician, school-master and surveyor of lands, was much employed by\" Mr. Fluker, son-in-law of General Waldo, as agent. The most distinguished of the inhabitants of Thomaston, was General Knox, commander of the American artil lery in the Revolution, and Secretary of War from 1785 to 1794. In the years 1793-4, he built his elegant mansion near the St. George's River, at the great bend, near where the fort stood. The size and style of the building, its piazzas and balconies, its farm, summer and out-houses, its gardens and walks, formed a residence which, at that and for along subsequent time, far surpassed any other in the country. Its cost was above $50,000. [See article Knox County.] Though the post-office was not established here until 1794, there was a mail carried on foot from Falmouth to Thomaston during the last years of the Revolutionary war. Among later citizens may be mentioned Hon. John Ruggles, once a United States senator ; Hon. William J. Farley ; Hon. Edward Rob inson, representative in Congress in 1837; Hon. Jonathan Cilley, who fell in a duel in 1839, while a member of Congress, and was greatly regretted as a national loss. The Thomaston Herald is the only newspaper published in the town. It is devoted to local news, and is an entertaining and useful sheet. The Thomaston Savings Bank, at the close of 1879, held de posits and profits to the amount of $161,253.84. The Thomaston Na tional Bank has a capital of $100,000. The George's National Bank has a capital of $110,000. There are a social and a circulating library in town. Rev. Robert Rutherford, who came over with Colonel Dunbar in 1729, first preached in Thomaston and Warren. He was a native of Ireland, and a Presbyterian. A Congregational church was gathered in 1807, over which Rev. John Lord was settled. The town now has a church-edifice of each of the following societies, Congregationalist, Methodist, Episcopal and Catholic, and two of the Baptists.

It is bounded on the north by Troy, east by Jackson, west by Unity, and south by Knox. The surface is quite broken, and is especially hilly in the north-eastern and south-western parts. Files Hill is the most notable eminence. Granitic rock is predominant. The soil is a clay loam on the levels and hollows, requiring considerable working, but yielding good crops of hay, potatoes and corn. The water-courses are Sandy Stream, a tributary of the Sebasticook, and the head-waters of"], [547, "TOPSFIELD. 539 Marsh River. There is one saw-mill for' long and short lumber, a shingle-inill and a grist-mill. The other manufactures are carriages, harnesses, coffins and caskets, boots and shoes, etc., etc. The Belfast and Moosehead railroad passes through this town, and has a station at Thorndike village, 16 miles from Belfast. The carriage roads, in general, are good, and afford many agreeable drives among hills and woods, interspersed with pleasant farm-houses. Higgin's Mineral Spring, in this town, has quite a local celebrity, its water being regarded as very healthful. Ichabod Hunt, a citizen of Thorndike, in 1880 reached the age of ninety-five years. Another cit izen, Joseph Seyward, is over ninety. The town sent some 60 men to the Union army during the war of the Rebellion. The religious so cieties of the town are Baptists, Free Baptists and Friends. The first have a good house of worship. This town was incorporated February 15, 1819, being named for Thomas Thorndike, one of the original proprietors. It was a part of the Waldo Patent. Previous to incorporation it bore the name of Lincoln Plantation. The petition for incorporation was signed by Joseph Shaw, Joseph Higgins and Stephen Jones. The number of public schoolhouses in Thorndike is nine, valued at $2,000. The population in 1870 was 730. In 1880 it was 713. The valuation in 1870 was $264,801. In 1880 it was $280,033.

TOlllhegrail TOWnship lies on the western side of Moosehead Lake, in the second range north of the line of the Bingham Purchase. Topsfield lies in the northern part of Washington County, and is bounded on the east by Codyville and Robbins Plantation, south by Talmage, west by Kossuth. Bascohegan Lake lies on the north, and partly within the township. Topsfield is in the second range north of Bingham's Penobscot purchase. Calais lies 36 miles to the south-east. The European and North American Railway station in Jackson Brook Plantation is 11 miles from the principal settlement which is in the south-eastern part. The Princeton station of the Penobscot and St. Croix Railroad is 16 miles distant. A stage-route formerly connected this town with Lincoln, on the first mentioned railroad. This is an excellent town for new settlers. There is one considerable eminence in the south-western part, estimated to be about 1,000 feet in height. Musquash, Tomah and Farrar ponds lie in the southern part of the town, \u2014 the first being about 3 miles by 2, in dimensions, the others 2 and 1 in length, and of proportional width. There is some granite rock in the eastern part. Tho soil is a gravelly loam. Wheat and potatoes are the chief crops. The buildings in the town are gen erally in good repair. There is one saw-mill. Topsfield was first settled by Nehemiah Kneeland from Topsfield, Massachusetts, in 1832. It was incorporated, February 24, 1838. It is said that 74 men from this town joined the Union army in the war of the Rebellion, \u2014 of whom 10 were lost. The Methodists and Congre-"], [548, "540 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. gationalists have a Union meeting-house here. The town has four public schoolhouses, valued at $600. The population in 1870 was 464 In 1880 it was massed with other settlements in the preliminary census report. The polls in 1870 numbered 105 ; in 188U, the same. The valuation in 1870 was $82,828. In 1880 it was e6\u00ab\u00ab,608. The rale of taxation in the latter year was 38 mills on the dollar. Topsham, in Sagadahoc County, is situated in a broad bend of the Androscoggin river extending, in general course, from Lisbon south-east to Brunswick, and from thence north-eastward to Merry meeting Bay. Bowdoin and Bowdoinham bound the town on the north, and Brunswick on all other sides, \u2014 with the northern extremity of Bath across the bay on the east. The streams are Little River, which separates it from Lisbon, Cathance River, which conies down from Bowdoin to the centre of the town ; then runs north-eastward into Bowdoinham, \u2014 imperfectly repeating within the town the course of the Androscoggin about its border. East of this lies Muddy River, a tide-water creek having the same course as the former. A short distance cast of this stream is Pleasant Point, \u2014 a part of Bowdoinham, but springing out into the bay from the north-eastern corner of Tops ham. The greatest length of the town is between the eastern and western angles, \u2014 the distance being about 9 miles. Its greatest width is from above the village to Lily Pond at the northern border of the town. The area is very near 25,000. The surface of Topsham is generally level, varied by a few ravines and low hills, \u2014 of which Ararat \u2014 a station of the U. S. Coast Survey a mile north of Topsham bridge\u2014 is the highest. In the higher portions the soil is a brown loam, on the plains a sandy loam, and in the lowlands, clay and clay loam. The rock is generally a very coarse granite, with a preponderance of felspar. The Trentort Felspar Company are operating a quarry here. The manufactures are at the first falls on the Androscoggin between the villages of Brunswick and Topsham. There are here the paper mill of the Bowdoiu Paper Company, a ship-yard or two, a planinc and threshing-mill, three lumber-mills, door, sash and stair factories, a grain-mill, bricks, etc. The Maine Central Railroad runs through the town, having a station at the village. Topsham is connected with Brunswick on the south side of the river by three bridges, two of which are railroad bridges. The upper railroad bridge is of wood ; the lower one is a long and beautiful structure of iron. An iron brido-e of a beautiful design has just been erected between the two villages for or dinary street uses. Topsham was first occupied about 1658 by Thomas and James Gyles, and three men named York with their families, who bought lands on the bay and river before King Philip's war. One of these built a house and resided at Fulton's Point, another at the head of Muddy River, and a third Gyles on Pleasant Point. At each of these places, not many years sine <-, the cellars and chimnies of their rude dwellings were clearly traceable. It is thought probable that the settler at Fulton's Point arrived several years prior to the others ; for it is stated that, in 1750, there was a tree upwards of one foot in diameter growing in the cellar. There is also a tradition that this settler lived for many years on friendly terms with the natives, but at last while absent in quest of provisions, the Indians massacred his family and burnt his house ; and the bereaved man now returned to f"], [549, "1 \"WALKER HOMESTEAD,\" TOPSHAM, (Sagadahoc County,) MAINE."], [550, "542 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. England. Both the other families were murdered by the natives. Gyles and his wife were shot while gathering their crops, and the children taken into captivity ; but all except a son were ransomed by the officers at Fort George, in Brunswick. The new settlement was projected by the Pejepscot proprietors about 1715. In 1721, sixteen families had located in the town, and a minister was employed ; but later the people probably worshipped at Brunswick until the erection of their meeting-house in 1759. The first church organization was Presbyterian, \u2014 the settlers being largely Scotch-Irish. The town fur nished 50 men for various service during the Revolutionary war. In the war of the Rebellion 144 men served on the side of the Union. The Sagadahoc Agricultural Society laid out its grounds and erected its hall here in 1856 ; since which other buildings and an elegant judge's stand have been erected. The annual shows which have generally been successful, grow more and more attractive. A large collection of paintings and engravings \u2014 some of which are works of great merit and value \u2014 belonging to Col. Wildes P. Walker, may properly be reckoned as belonging to the attractions of the town ; since the owner, with rare public spirit, often throws his gallery open to his townsmen. The churches are neat structures situated in the village, and belong to the Congregationalists, Baptists and Free-Baptists. The Franklin Family School, which attained its highest success under the management of its founder, Hon. Warren Johnson, is still open ; and its building and grounds are an ornament to the village. Topsham has 12 public, schoolhouses, and the total school property of the town is valued at $7,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $880,265. In 1880 it was $819,537. The population in 1870 was 1,498. In 1880 it was 1,547. TremOllt, in Hancock County, embraces the south-western portion of Mount Desert Island. Tinker's, Moose, Hardwood, Grott's and Longley's Islands are also within its limits. The feature from which the town takes its name is the three contiguous peaks of Beech Mountain, and east and west peaks of the Western Mountains. Dog Mountain has been carefullyr prospected with spade and pick, for money hidden by Captain Kidd. The peak known as the \" Lover's Scalp \" has, on its eastern side, an almost per pendicular descent of 900 feet to the waters of Somes' Sound. The other mountains of Tremont are Dog, Flying, Bald, Burnt and Mount Gilboa. Dog Mountain is 670 feet in height ; Flying Mountain, 300 ; Bald Mountain, 250 ; Burnt Mountain, 175 ; and Mount Gilboa, 160. South West and Bass are the chief harbors, and the villages on these are the principal centres of business in the town. On Heat's Stream is a saw-mill, and upon the outlet of Seal Cove Pond is a grist-mill. Both streams empty into Seal Cove, which is a safe and convenient harbor. The production of the saw-mill is about 250,000 M. of lumber, and sev eral hundred thousand staves annually. There is also a shingle-mill on Bass Harbor Stream. Some ship-building is done at both Bass and South West harbors. At the latter place is a factory for canning fish, and at West Tremont is a fish-curing establishment ; also the large brick-yard of the Tremont Brick Co., and a boat-builder's shop. The \" staff of life \" to the people of the town is found chiefly in the sea. Fernald's Point on Somes' Sound near the northern border of the town is thought by many to be the site of the ancient \" St. Sauvcnr,'' the settlement of the colony sent out by Madame de Guercheville in"], [551, "TRESCOTT. 543 1613. \" About half across the isthmus and a little up the hill (Flying Mountain), so as to command the water on either side without losing its shelter, are two holes in the ground which are shown as the ruins of the Frenchmen's cellars. They are a few rods apart, running north and south, 10 to 12 feet long at present, from 2 to 3 feet deep, and of varying width. They seem to have been gradually filled in from the hill above, and overgrown with grass. On the very day of our visit (1866) a spruce, some eight inches in diameter had been cut down in one of them. The old man who was our guide said the cellars were there in the time of his grandfather, who was the first settler, and he always said that they were the remains of the French colony.\" Stories of the discovery of gold buried by the French are rife, like those of pirates' treasures further south. A bank of shells near North East Harbor, on the opposite side of the Sound, probably marks the neighborhood of an Indian village ; and Indian relics of various sorts are not uncommon. Tremont was set off from Mount Desert and incorporated in 1848, under the name of Mansel, from Mount Mansel, the name given to the island by Winthrop's company of emigrants to Massachusetts Bay in 1630 ; it having been the first land discovered by them. See Eden. Tremont has two churches, a Congregationalist and a Methodist. Thirteen public schoolhouses, and school property to the value of $13,500, furnish the means of youthful education. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $262,353. In 1880 it was $361,419. The popula tion in 1870 was 1,822. In the census of 1880 it was 2,011. TreiltOn, in Hancock County, lies north of Mount Desert Island, between Union River Bay and Jordan's River. Ellsworth bounds it on the north. It is on the stage-line from Ellsworth to South West Harbor. The surface of the town is undulating. It lies partially or wholly within the great mica-schist basin of the county, which is supposed to be of the Cambrian age. The occupation of the people aside from agriculture is connected with the sea. The town was formerly known as Number One of the six second class townships granted by Massachusetts in 1762, or according to Williamson, in 1764. It was confirmed to Paul Thorndike and others in 1785 The first English settlement known was in 1763. Anterior to this there were French settlers at Trenton and Oak Points. Thom son's and Asley's Islands are within its jurisdiction. Previous to 1870, Trenton had embraced the whole peninsula between Union River Bay and Frenchman's Bay, but at that date it was divided, and the eastern half incorporated as Lemoine. The Baptists and Methodists have each a church in town. There are seven public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $2,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $118,280. In 1880 it was $111,817. The population in 1870 was 678. In the census of 1880 it is placed at 639. TreSCOtt, lies in the south-eastern part of Washington Coun ty. Lubec bounds it on the east, Edmunds and Pembroke on the north, Whiting and Cutler on the west, and the ocean on the south. The south branch of Cobscook (tide river) crosses the northern part, and into this, at.its western extremity, empties Orange River. Within the"], [552, "544 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. town are the harbors of Moose Cove, Bailey's, Mistake and Haycock. There are here a saw-mill manufacturing long and short lumber, and two grist-mills. The town is flourishing in trade and navigation. The Trescott Mining and Manufacturing Company is located here. Tres cott is connected with Lubec by a stage line. This town was incorporated Feb. 27, 1827. It was formerly No. 9. The principal religious society in the town is the Roman Catholic.

Tl'Oy lies in the northern part of Waldo County, adjoining Som erset and Penobscot counties on the north, and the latter on the east. Burnham bounds it on the west, and Thorndike and Jackson on the south. The area is 20,052 acres. Unity or Twenty-five Mile Pond forms a part of the western boundary. In the northern part is Carl ton's Bog, having an area of 1,000 acres, and drained by a stream of the same name. On this stream were formerly several mills which manu factured large quantities of lumber. In the southern part of the town is Bog Stream, which also has mill privileges ; both this and the former emptying into Unity Pond. A mill on Martin's Stream, in the south eastern part of the town, formerly manufactured some lumber. The manufactures now consists of furniture and carriages, there being five manufacturers of the last. The surface of the town is for the most part uneven, rising into large swells with table lands and valleys, all of which are very fertile. The inhabitants are generally and quite successfully engaged in ag riculture. The centres of business are Troy village, Center, and West and East Troy, \u2014 which are also post-offices. The town is 22 miles north-west of Belfast. The nearest railroad stations are in Burnham and Detroit. The first clearing in this town was made about the year 1801, by John Rogers, who was also agent for the proprietor, General Bridge, of Chelmsford, Mass. The first mill in the township was built by the lat ter. The ownership soon after passed to Benjamin Joy and Jonathan C. Hastings, of Boston. The earliest settlers were Henry Warren, Charles Gerrish, jr., Enoch Bagley, Enoch Bagley, jr., Jonathan Bagley, Christopher Varney, John Smart, Andrew Bennett, John Rogers, James Work, Nehemiah Fletcher, Hanson Whitehouse, Francis, Charles and Thomas Hollman, and Joseph Green, who came from dif ferent parts of Maine, and settled here from 1801 to 1813. At the first organization of the settlement into a plantation it received the name of Bridgestown, in honor of the first proprietor. It was incorporated as a town Feb. 22, 1812, under the name of Kingsville, in honor of the first Governor of Maine. Since then it has borne the names of Joy, Montgomery, and finally Troy. The last change was made February 10, 1827. The religious societies are the Methodists and Christian. There are eleven public schoolhouses ; and the school property is valued at $3,000.

Turner lies on the western side of the Androscoggin River in"], [553, "TURNER. 545 the north-western part of Androscoggin County. Its length on the river is ten miles, the towns on the eastern side being Leeds and Greene. The western line is of equal length, where it joins Hartford, Buckfield and Hebron. Its width at the north is about three miles, where it joins Livermore. Minot and Auburn bound it on the south, the line being there about five and one-half miles. Its area is near 33,793 acres. The principle streams are Twenty-mile River, which crosses from the western side of the town to Androscoggin River on the east ; and Martin's Stream, coming down through the northern part of the town, to Twenty-mile at Chase's Mills. Within its limits and on its borders are several ponds, of which Bear Pond, con taining an area of one square mile, and Pleasant Pond, one mile in length and one-half mile in width, are the largest. The others are Little Wilson, Pickerel, Lily,Sandy Bottom, Frog, Black, Mud, Long and Round ponds. The scenery of Turner is various and agreeable, though there are no high hills or deep valleys. A cave called \" Ledge House,\" about 15 feet square, is a curious freak of nature. The rock is granite; and a quarry in the south-east part of the town is worked through the year. The soil in the valleys and lowlands is alluvial, of vegetable nature at the top, with a substratum of sand. The farmers are generally thrifty ; as the neatness and size of the buildings prove. The town has been noted for a culture much above the average agricultural towns. The plantation name of Turner, was Silvester Canada, it having been granted in 1765 to the heirs of Captain Joseph Silvester and Company, for the services of the latter parties in an expedition against Canada in 1690. It was incorporated as the town of Turner in 1786 ; being named for Rev. Charles Turner, of Scituate, Mass., one of the proprietors, as an ac knowledgment of his services in aid of its settlement. The first set tlers were Daniel Staples, Thomas Record, Elisha Record, Joseph Leavitt, and Abner Phillips, who removed thither in 1772. The fol lowing were eminent citizens of the town at a later period : Dr. Luther Cary, who practiced in Turner from 1798 until about 1848, being hon ored with several elections to the presidency of the Medical Society of Maine, and in 1805 appointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas for Oxford County. Dr. Timothy Howe practiced in the north parish from 1806 until the close of his life in 1848. He was the author of* many sketches of Turner families. Of many natives of the town edu cated as physicians, Dr. Philip Bradford was the only one who re mained to practice ; retaining the confidence of his townsmen until his death in 1863. Among those more or less eminent who were natives of Turner, are Hon. T. O. Howe, national senator from Wisconsin ; Hon. Eugene Hale, for many years representative in Congress from; the fifth district of Maine ; Clarence Hale, of Portland ; C. S. Conant, of Lewiston ; Hon. Washington Gilbert, judge of probate for Sagadahoc County ; Hon. Leonard Swett, of Chicago ; Hon. E. M. Prince, of Bloomington, 111., master in chancery for M'Lean County ; William Cary, U. S. attorney-general for the Territory of Utah ; William W. Cushings, of Missouri, merchant ; and B. B. Murray, jr., for several years adjutant-general, and later IT. S. marshal of Maine. Among those prominent in his own town and state in the last century we should not omit to mention Hon. Job Prince. At one time or another he served acceptably in all the principal offices of the town ; was president of the State Senate in 1839; then judge of probate; and subsequently"], [554, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 546 in several other offices. During his lifetime he administered on the estates of 91 different persons. A large number of persons, natives or residents of the town, were engaged in the Revolutionary war. Colonel William Turner was aide to Washington ; Elijah Dresser was in the battle of Bunker Hill ; Lu ther Cary, Joseph Wardwell, Nathaniel Sawtelle and Joseph Ludden, were in the Continental army ; Samuel Blake, Mark Andrews, Moses Merrill, Levi Merrill, Malachi Waterman, Richard Phillips, Abner Phillips and Joseph Leavitt, in the defense of Boston, 1775 ; Gen. Peleg Wadsworth, Benjamin Jones, John Keen, John Keen, jr., Asa Battles, Nathaniel Shaw, Daniel French, James Phillips, Nathan Richmond, William Hayford, Benjamin Merrill, Job Randall, Solomon Millett, Ephraim Andrews, Benjamin Alden, William Putnam, John Allen, Thomas Atherton, Benj. Chamberlain, Wait Bradford, Isaac Phillips, Ichabod Phillips and Andrew Bass, in the Massachusetts militia ; Israel Smith, Laban Smith, James Lara, Bennett Pompilly, Richard Hine, Benjamin Conant, Paul Lowell, Joshua Davis, Moses Snell and Simeon Caswell, in Massachusetts Continental*; Jesse Bradford served as guard of Burgoyne's captured army ; Abney Thayer on Castle Wil liam, Boston Harbor ; Elisha Fisher, in Washington's life-guard ; Abial Turner, in commissary department ; John Bailey in last three years service ; Daniel Pratt, in Rhode Island troops ; Cornelius Jones, in Massachusetts troops and as a seaman ; James Allen, musician in Massachusetts line ; Jacob Gardner, during the war ; and Nathaniel Marston, in New Hampshire line. In the war of 1812, Captain Ste phen Turner was killed at the battle of Bridgewater, and Theodocius Merrill died in the army. During this w-ar the enemy making a demon stration against Portland ; a large number of militia were ordered there in defense ; and for this short campaign Mr. Benjamin Jones furnished nine sons. In the war of the Rebellion Turner furnished 319 men, paying them an aggregate bounty of $62,445 ; and furnishing for sol diers' relief $1,575. Twenty-eight of these were killed in battle or died of disease in the army. The first mill in town was built by Samnel Blake in 1775, on Twenty-mile Kiver, at what is now known as Turner village, and was destroyed in the great freshet of 1785. It appears to have been both a saw and grain mill. It was rebuilt the next season. At this place there are now a grain-mill, a general saw-mill, a box, carriage and shoe factory, a tannery, and several smaller manufactures. The other prin cipal places of business, are North Turner Bridge on the Androscoggin River; Keen's Mills, some three miles below, where there are mills for grain, lumber and paper pulp ; Chase's Mills, on Twenty-mile River, in the western part of the town, having a hub factory and a lumber mill ; North Turner, where is a grain-mill, lumber mills, a cheese and a shoe factory ; and West Turner, which has a large cheese factory. The first fulling mill in this town was built at Bradford village, and operated by John Haley. A pottery was also established at the same place by Reuben Thorp. By an act of General Court in 1803, William Brad ford, Benjamin Evans, John Turner, Daniel Cary, Luther Cary and John Loring, were incorporated as a body politic by the name of the Ministerial and Grammar School Funds in the town of Turner ; and they and their successors were to be a body politic and incorporate by that name forever. Their number was never to be over seven"], [555, "UNION. 547 nor less than five, and they were to fill from members of the town any vacancy that might occur in tho board. They were authorized to sell and convey in fee-simple all of said ministerial and school lands, and put the proceeds at interest. The latter was to accumulate until there should be a fund, which would yield annually from the ministerial fund the sum of $350, and from the school land $200, when the former should be applied by the trustees to the settlement of a learned Prot estant minister ; and that it should never be in the power of the town to alienate or anywise alter the funds aforesaid. The ministerial fund became available in 1811, and the interest arising therefrom was paid to Rev. Allen Greely, Congregationalist, who was the only settled min ister. In 1834 a Universalist Society having been formed, it was agreed between their minister, Rev. George Bates, and Rev. Mr. Greely, to divide the income of the fund between them ; and in 1840, the legisla ture of Maine authorized the trustees to divide the fund among several Protestant ministers settled in town in proportion to the rateable polls belonging to the congregations of said ministers. The town now has Congregationalist, Baptist, Universalist and Methodist societies. The first school taught in town was a private one, kept on the \" Lower Street,\" about 1788, by Mr. Arthur Bradman, of Turner. The town has now eighteen public schoolhouses, valued at $7,000. The total amount expended for schools from April 1, 1878 to April 1, 1879 was $3,271. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $815,684. In 1880 it was $748,856.. The population at that date was 2,380. In 1880 it was 2,286. The rate of taxation in 1880 was .0145 on $1. Umbag'Og' Lake. See article on Rangeley Lakes. TJniOll is situated in the western part of Knox County, 13 miles north-west of Rockland. It is bounded on the north-east by Appleton and Hope, south by Warren, and west by Waldoboro and Washington. The town contains four ponds (two lying on the border), whose outlets furnish a large amount of water-power. Their names are Crawford's, Seven Tree, Sennebec and Round; the three first having an area of about one mile each, and the last about one third of a mile. The town excels in picturesque arrangement of hill, dale, water and woods, and in the summer season the scenery is very beautiful. The soil is good and the farmer finds profitable returns for his toil. The town has four villages, Union and North, East and South Union. The manufactures at Union are carriages (three factories), cul tivators, leather, harnesses, boots and shoes. At South Union are a cab inet and musical instrument factory, an iron foundry, machine-shop, and a coffin and casket factory. At East Union are a lumber-mill, a chair and table factory, etc. Union was a part of the Muscongus, or Waldo patent, and was purchased of the Waldo heirs by Dr. John Taylor of Lunenburg, Mass., in 1774, \" for the consideration of \u00a31,000 lawful money.\" The settlement was commenced the same year, and such favorable terms were offered to actual settlers that, in a few years, the whole tract was taken up. It first bore the name Taylortown, from its owner, but was organized as a plantation under the name of Sterlingtown, to gratify some of its inhabitants who had emigrated from a place of that name in Great Britain. It was incorporated as the"], [556, "548 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. town of Union in 1786. It contained at this time 19 families, a large proportion of whom had emigrated from Massachusetts ; and the har mony that prevailed among them was purposely commemorated in the name of the town. At this time the town contained 77 families, bearing among others the following well-known names : Adams, Bowen, Butler, Cummings, Grinnell, Hawes, Hills, Holmes, Mero, Par tridge, Robbins and Ware. The settlers were mostly devout Chris tians, and made every effort to cultivate the feeling for friendly inter course which makes life blessed. A church was formed in 1803, and in 1805 Rev. Henry True was settled. The town now has a church of each the Baptist, Congregationalist, Methodist and Universalist denom inations. There are fourteen public schoolhouses, and the school prop erty is valued at $9,850. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $533,660. In 1880 it was $597,330. The population in 1870 was 1,701.

It is bounded by Burnham on the north, Thorndike on the east, Freedom and Albion on the south, and Unity Plantation on the west. A broad belt of the town on this side consists of wooded plain. There are smaller areas of woodland in the eastern and other parts of the town. The surface generally is not greatly broken, and lies in swells and val leys of no great height or depth. The soil is of clay and sandy loam, and a light and a dark loam, and is tolerably fertile. Hay is the crop hav ing the greatest value. Unity or Twenty-five Mile Pond lies partially within the northern part of the town. The principal water-course is Sandy Stream, which runs through the town from the south-east to Unity Pond. Unity village is situated upon this stream about one mile south of the pond. The principal water-powers are on this stream. The manufactures consist of plows, carriages, one grist and planing mill, lumber (six mills), tinware, cheese (Unity Cheese Factory), har nesses, etc., etc. The Belfast branch of the Maine Central Railroad runs through the town, having a station at the village. The habitations in general have a thrifty appearance, and the roads are good. This town belonged to the Plymouth Patent. Its settlement was commenced about the year 1782.

UptOIl, in Oxford County, lies on the New Hampshire border, in the southern part of the Rangeley Lake region. Grafton bounds it on the south, Umbagog Lake lies on the west, and Lower Richardson Lake on the north-east. Rapid River (by which the Rangeley lakes through Lower Richardson discharge into Umbagog) runs acvoss the north-eastern corner. Cambridge River, rising chiefly in Grafton, runs through the south-western part to the south arm of the Umbagog lake. Dead Cambridge River, a branch of the Cambridge, rises in a pond in C. Surplus, on the east, forming a junction with the main river at its principal angle near the middle of the town. In the southern part of Upton are three large hills ; the south-eastern one bearing the name of First B. Hill, and the western one, the name of Upton or Second B. Hill. Most of the settlements in the township are be tween Cambridge River and the junction near this hill of the three southern roads. On the falls near the lake are a saw-mill and grist mill. Near by is a starch factory, carriage and shoe shops, store, etc. There are two hotels at this place. It is on the principal western route to the lakes. Cambridge and Errol in New Hampshire are the ad joining towns on the west. Upton is 50 miles north-west of Paris, and 27 from Bethel, on the stage-route from the latter place to Errol.

Cyr Plantation bounds it on the south, Grand Isle and Number 17 on the west. The form of this towi -hip is triangular, the variable course of the river forming the base line, while straight lines mark the other sides. Violette Brook and its northern branch drain the southern and middle parts of the town. There are two lumber-mills, one grist-mill and a starch factory fully operated. The settlements are chiefly along the river, which is skirted by the county road. The Van Buren post-office is in the south-eastern part of the town, and there is another near the northern corner. Van Buren is the terminus of the stage-lines from Fort Fair-"], [558, "550 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. field and to Fort Kent. The New Brunswick Railway follows the St. John on the opposite shore.

Vassal DOrO, in Kennebec County, lies on the east side of the Kennebec River, north of and adjoining Augusta. It is bounded by China on the east, Sidney on the west, and Winslow on the north. Webber's Pond, having an area of 2.10 square miles, lies a little south of the centre of the town ; a portion of China Pond projects into the eastern side, and Three-mile Pond forms a portion of the boundary between it and China at the south-east. The Kennebec River separates it from Sidney, which constituted a part of Vassalboro from its incor poration in 1771 until 1792, when its territory west of the river was set off and incorporated as an independent town. The first settlements were made along the river about 1760 ; but they increased so slowly that eight years later this extensive township contained but ten fam ilies. Dennis and John Gatchell were among the earliest settlers. Both were guides to Arnold's expedition up the Kennebec in 1776. Dennis was chosen captain of the town in 1775; John was a noted hunter, and a man of great strength. Once when a full-grown moose which he had wounded turned upon him, he seized the animal, threw him down and cut his throat with a jack-knife. John's house was sit uated on the bank of the Kennebec, and had an underground passage"], [559, "VEAZIE. 551 to the river, to allow of escape should hostile Indians effect an entrance into the house. Other early settlers were Samuel and Asa Reddington, both of whom had served in the war for independence. The latter had been a member of the famous Washington Life-Guard. Most of the early settlers were from the Cape Cod towns, and many were members of the Society of Friends. Vassalboro was represented in the Provin cial Congress in 1775 by Remington Hobby, and in 1777 by Mr. A. Lovejoy. The surface of the town is beautifully diversified with hill and val ley, the highest eminences being Tabor and Cross hills. The soil is ex cellent, and the farmers generally are thrifty, and the town is wealthy and prosperous. Much attention is given to the cultivation of fruits and with marked success. There are several mills in town. On the outlet of Three-mile Pond, which discharges into Webber's Pond are a saw, grist and excelsior mill ; on Seven-mile Brook, which connects Webber's Pond with the Kennebec, are two saw-mills, a paper-mill and a machine-shop. Ac cording to the Hydrographic survey of Maine, there are nineteen powers in town. Thirteen of these are on the outlet of China Lake. This sheet of water is 201 feet above the tide, has an area of 4,000 acres, and its drainage basin is about 39,520 acres in extent. The stream from the lake is six and one-third miles long, in which distance it has nine dams and falls 160 feet. Of these powers the first is occu pied by a grist-mill and woolen-mill, a saw-mill and shovel-handle fac tory ; on the second is a grist-mill ; on the third, a shingle-mill, and a wood and iron machine-shop ; the fifth is occupied by the Vassalboro Mills Company in manufacturing woolen goods. This mill has twenty sets of cards, with the associated machinery, and a wood and iron machine-shop attached. The capital stock of the company in 1869 was $450,000. On the seventh power is a factory for making knit goods and another for shoe pegs. On the eleventh, there is saw-mill and a threshing-mill. On the thirteenth, is a board, plank and lath-mill. A line of the Maine Central railway extends through the entire length of the town along the river. The Oak Grove Seminary and Commercial College is a popular and prosperous institution under the care of the Society of Friends. It is situated in an attractive location a short distance north of Vassalboro Corner. The Congregationalists, Baptists, Free Baptists, Catholics, and Friends, each have a society and church edifice in the town, and the Methodists have three. Vassalboro has twenty-two schoolhouses, valued at $10,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,130,348. In 1880 it was $1,188,980. The population at the same date was 2,919. In 1880 it has increased to 2,621. Veazie, in Penobscot County, is a small town, with its eastern side resting on the Penobscot, and bounded by Bangor on the west, and Orono on the north-east, and the river on the east and south. Its area is 2,560 acres. There are no large streams within the town. The Penobscot, which separates it from Eddington and Brewer, fur nishes the water-power. The village is situated on the river, at about the middle of the eastern side. There is here a strong dam, upon which are located two blocks of saw-mills. The \" Upper Block \" (so"], [560, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 552 called), contains two gangs of saws, six single saws, and a lath-mill ; the \" Lower Block \" has one gang of saws, three single saws, lath-mill, clapboard and shingle-mill, and others. At extreme low water the power in this fall is 3,300 horse-powers, gross, for the 24 hours, or 133,000 spindles. The manufactures are all sorts of lumber, cooper's ware, etc. There are four stores and a hotel. Veazie has a very pretty village. The European and North American Railway runs through the town, having a station at the village. The town was formerly the seventh ward of Bangor, but was set off and incorporated March 26th, 1853. It was named from General Samuel Veazie, who was the owner of the mills and privilege, and the chief portion of the property. The associations are those of the P. of H., and the K. of H. The religious societies are the Congregationalists, Methodists, Baptists and Free Baptists. There are three public schoolhouses, for 214 children of school age. The average attendance is about one-half that number. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $168,432. In 1880 it was $121, 439. The population in 1870 was 810. In 1880 it was 622. Verona, in Hancock County, is situated on the Penobscot River, just south of Bucksport, and 20 miles west of Ellsworth. It is connected with Bucksport by an. excellent bridge of stone and timber, 650 feet in length. The town is mostly high and rocky, and the soil l.ard, but affords an excellent range for sheep. Within a few years apple orchards have been planted, and are doing well. Verona is said to have grown and shipped more wood to the acre than any other town in the county. The chief industry is weir fishing ; and during the \" run of the salmon \" there is but little sleep for the fishermen. Verona is the earliest settled locality on the Penobscot above Bel fast. It was first mentioned in books as the island of Lett. It be longed to the Waldo Patent. Falling into the possession of an orphan girl, it gained the name of Orphan Island. Later, it was purchased by a Mr. Wetmore, and bore the name of Wetmore Isle up to the time of its incorporation in 1861. It was formerly a part of Prospect, and for many years a part of Bucksport. Its area is 5,600 acres. It was named for a town on the Po River, in Italy. Verona has four schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $2,400. The valua tion of estates in 1870 was $51,075. In 1880 it was $50,073. The population in 1870 was 352. In the census of 1880 ft was 356. Vienna is the most north-westerly town of Kennebec County, and is marked by considerable hilliness. Gilman Mountain, which ex tends into the adjoining town of Rome, is the greatest elevation. Granite is the principal rock. The grazing qualities of the town are excellent, and there are several fine farms. There are two mineral springs of some note in town. Vienna is bounded on the east by Rome, on the south by Mount Vernon and Chesterville, (the latter in Franklin County), west by the same town, and north by New Sharon. In and about Vienna are numerous ponds, the largest of which, called Flying Pond, forms a portion of the south-west boundary. A p rtion of Parker Pond lies in the southern part of the town ; Egypt Pond is on the southern border a little west of the last ; at the north-west angle is McCardy Pond ; Kimball Pond midway of the northern line, and Boody and Kidder ponds succeed it on the east. A stream from"], [561, "VTNALHAVEN. 553 Kimball and Boody ponds, running southward, and emptying into Flying Pond, furnishes the chief water-power in the town. On this stream, at Vienna Village, are a shingle-mill, a saw-mill for various lumber, and a grist-mill. Other manufactures of the town are boxes and measures, cooperage, carriages and sleighs, shovel-handles, etc. There is a stage-route to Augusta from the village. The nearest rail way connection is Maine Central station at Belgrade depot, 12 miles distant. This township was settled about 1786, the titles being given by Jedediah Prescott of Winthrop, and Nathaniel Whittier, of Readfield, who had purchased it of Massachusetts. As a plantation it was named Goshen. Its incorporation as a town occurred in 1802. The first set tlers were Joshua Howland, John Thompson, Patrick Gilbraith, Noah Prescott, and John and William Allen. Following these were Arnold Witheren, James and Robert Cofren, Jonathan Gordon, Jedediah Whittier, Gideon Wells, Elijah Bunker, Daniel Matthews, Benjamin Porter, Timothy White, Caleb Brown and Joshua Moore. The first town meeting was held in that year, \u2014 Noah Prescott being moderator, and Daniel Morrill, clerk. The selectmen chosen were Jacob Graves, James Cofren and Joshua Moore ; treasurer, Arnold Witheren ; con stable and collector, Thomas Lines. Later notable citizens have been Nathaniel Graves, Oren Dowst, John Marden, John Mooers, Nathaniel Whitten, Andrew Neal, and others. The first child born in town was Briggs Howland. Vienna sent 91 soldiers into the war for the Union, of which number 14 were lost. Jesse Lee, from Virginia, was the first settled minister. There are now in town Free Baptist and Methodist societies, each of whom have a suitable church. Vienna has ten public schoolhouses valued at $1,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $200,015. In 1880 it was $167,316. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 23 mills on a dollar. The population in 1870 was 740. According to the census of 1880 it is now 644. Vilialliaven, in Knox County, lies at the entrance of Pen obscot Bay. With North Haven, formerly included, the area of the town was 16,527 acres. It was what was known in the early history of New England as South Fox Island, taking its name from a number of silver-gray foxes seen there. On account of its safe and convenient harbors it was a place of much resort for the early voyagers. There was, however, no permanent settlement until 1765, and even then the inhabitants did not enjoy undisturbed quiet. During the Revolution the British at Castine impressed many of the islanders, forcing them to labor on the fortifications in that place. Many also fled from the island, leaving their houses to be reduced to ashes by the soldiers who plundered them. On the conclusion of peace the inhabitants returned ; and 72 of the number purchased the whole island from Massachusetts, for the sum of \u00a3246. Vinalhaven has a bold shore ; yet running in between projecting bluffs, are good harbors on every side. One of the best of these is Carver's Harbor, in the southern extremity of the island, where also is the principal village. The island is 15 miles east of Rockland. The surface is very broken, so that not more than one-third of the area is suitable for cultivation. The 6oil is gravelly. The crops are principally grain and potatoes. Isle au Haut and Baron moun-"], [562, "554 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. tains are the highest eminences, being nearly 400 feet in height. The ponds are named Folly, Round, Otter, Cedar, Mills and Branch. There are several excellent tide-powers on the island, which have, at one time or another, been improved. The manufactures are meal, flour, lumber, canned lobsters, horse-nets, harnesses, boots and shoes. Large quantities of granite are quarried here, and the Bodwell Granite Com pany has a polishing-mill for this material. The rock of the island is chiefly a blue and gray granite. Vinalhaven was incorporated in 1789; being named in honor of John Vinal, Esq., of Boston, who had aided the inhabitants in securing titles to their lands. The Fox Islanders, it is said, were early \" noted for their humanity and benevolence to strangers.\" There is a Union church in Vinalhaven ; but the Free Baptists are the principal society. The number of public schoolhouses in the town is twelve. The value of school property is estimated at $7,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $264,960. In 1880 it was $470,514. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 25 mills on the dollar. The population hi 1870 was 1,851. In 1880 it was 2,855. Wade Plantation, in Aroostook County, lies on the Aroostook River, in the fourth range from the eastern border. It is bounded on the east by Washburn, north by Perham Plantation, and south by Castle Hill. The Aroostook River passes through the south eastern part of the town, and is here crossed by a bridge 60 feet in length. The surface is without any considerable hills or valleys. There is a good, loamy soil, yielding abundantly in wheat, oats and potatoes, which are the crops receiving most attention. The inhabi tants are at present engaged almost exclusively in agriculture. There is here a sulphur spring, said to be the best in the State. The town is 54 miles north by north-west of Houlton, via Wash burn. It is 15 miles to the railroad station in Caribou. The settle ments are on the river in the south-eastern part of the township. Wade Plantation was organized May 2, 1874. It has a public library of 75 volumes. There are already three public schoolhouses, valued at $300. The population in 1870 was 76. The number of polls in 1880 was 24. The valuation in 1880 was $10,165, and the rate of taxation 16 mills on the dollar. Wait\u00a9 lies in the northern part of Washington County. It is bounded on the west by Talmage, south by Indian Township, and north by Robbin's Plantation. It is 30 miles from Calais and 52 miles from Machias, on the Houlton and Baring Road. The nearest rail road station is at Princeton, 8 miles distant. Tomah Stream runs southward through the midst. The other streams are tributaries of this. The underlying rock in the town is granitic. The soil is fertile ; but hay is at present found the most profitable crop, by reason of the demand for it by lumbermen. The forests in this town are princi pally of beech and maple. Waite was incorporated in 1876. It sent 13 men to the Union army during the war of the Rebellion, losing 4. It has two public schoolhouses, and the entire school property is valued at $2,000. The population in 1870 was 122. In 1880 it was massed with other divis-"], [563, "WALDO COUNTY. 555 ions. The polls in 1870 numbered 32; in 1880, 48. The valuation in 1870 was $28,700. In 1880 it was $31,400. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 3 per cent. WaldO lies near the centre of Waldo County ; having Brooks on the north, Swanville on the east, Belfast on the south and Morrill on the west. The Passagassawakeag Stream runs southward through the western part, and the Wescot Stream through the eastern part. The Ames Ponds, in the eastern part of the town, are the principal bodies of water. Felspathic granite is the prevailing rock. The soil is alluvial, and hay is at present found the most profitable crop. Farm ing is the almost exclusive industry of the inhabitants. The nearest railroad station is at Belfast, 6 miles distant. Waldo contains about 11,600 acres. Waldo Plantation was or ganized July 6, 1821, and consisted only of the so-called \" Three Miles Square,\" or the \" Six Thousand Acre Tract,\" which was set off on execution from the estate of Brigadier General Waldo, of Boston, deceased, to Sarah Waldo, administratrix of the estate of Samuel Waldo, of Falmouth, Maine, deceased. This tract was appraised at $8,000 by Robert Houston, James Nesmith and Daniel Clary, of Bel fast. William Taggart and a Mr. Smith, from New Hampshire, made the first clearing in 1798, near the south-east corner, one hundred rods from the Belfast line. No family resided upon it until November 181 1, when Henry Davidson moved in, continuing a resident 36 years. In 1800 came Jonathan Thurston, from Belfast, followed in 1805 by Josiah Sanborn, from Exeter, N.H. In 1809 Malcolm and Gleason surveyed the tract, dividing it into 60 lots, in 6 ranges of 10 lots each. In 1824, the plantation was enlarged by the annexation of 5,318 acres from Swanville ; and in 1836, a gore of about 150 acres lying between Knox and the \" Three Miles Square \" was annexed, which completed the township as at present constituted. Waldo was incorporated as a town March 17, 1845. There were, in 1880, one resident aged ninety eight, and six who were between eighty and ninety years of age. The town has a free meeting-house for religious uses. The resident clergy man is a Methodist. The number of public schoolhouses is seven. The value of the school property in the town is $2,000. The population in 1870 was 648. In 1880 it was 664. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $144,218. In 1880 it was $146,923. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 13 mills on the whole valuation. WaldO COUllty is situated upon the western shores of Penobscot Bay and River. Knox County forms the southern border, Kennebec County the western, Somerset the north-western, and Pe nobscot County the northern. Measuring from its extreme angles, this county is somewhat near a square in form, although the sides are swelled and broken in, making a quite irregular outline. Its largest side, and nine of the towns are upon the bay and river ; this extent of shore-line giving excellent maritime facilities. An open winter harbor may, with rare exceptions, be found anywhere on its coast ; while many spacious havens with good depth of water, afford the best of advantages for ship-building, commerce and the fisheries. The agri-"], [564, "556 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. cultural resources of the county are good, furnishing by far the larger number of inhabitants with occupation and support.* Waldo County formed part of York County's territory until 1760, when Lincoln County was established, which included it until 1789, when Hancock County was erected ; this next held it until 1827, when, on February 7th, it was incorporated as the County of Waldo, and was named for Gen. Samuel Waldo. The erection of Knox County in 1860 took off from Waldo County the towns of Appleton, Camden, Hope, North Haven and Vinalhaven. In its present form, Waldo County embraces 25 towns and one city, \u2014 the latter being Belfast, the county capital. The population in 1870 was 34,640. In 1880 it was 32,468. The valuation in 1870 was $10,090,581. In 1880 it was $9,577,834. There are no mountains in the county, strictly speaking, but there are several high hills which have been given the title. The surface is broken and uneven. In Prospect, Stockton and Frankfort, the view of the Penobscot River and valley from the high, rounded hills, almost equals the scenery of the Hudson. At Belfast, the harbor has often been called as beautiful as the Bay of Naples. A history of Waldo County properly begins with an account of the Muscongus, or Waldo Patent. This grant, issued by the Plymouth Council in 1630, to John Beauchamp of London, and Thomas Leverett of Boston, Eng., extended on the seaboard between the Muscongus and Penobscot rivers, and comprised nearly 1,000 square miles, taking in the whole of the present county of Knox, except the Fox Islands, and of Waldo County, with the exception of territory now covered byr five towns. No price wa6 paid for this tract ; it was thought that the set tlement of the section would enhance the value of others. Success in the fisheries at Monhegan, and in other localities along the coast of Maine, hastened an occupation of the Muscongus grant ; and in the spring of 1630, Edward Ashley and William Pierce, agents of the patentees, came with laborers and mechanics, and established a trading house on the George's River, in what is now Thomaston. This settle ment was broken up by King Philip's war, which terminated in 1678. After this the whole territory lay desolate for nearly 40 years. On the death of Beauchamp, Leverett became by law possessed of the whole grant ; and for several years he assumed its management. Through him the patent descended to his son, Governor John Leverett of Mas sachusetts, and in 1714, to President John Leverett of Harvard College, the grandson of the latter, and the great-grandson of the original grantee. In 1719 peace was apparently restored, and Leverett entered upon measures for re-settling and re-organizing the patent. He parcelled the land into ten shares in common, and conveyed them to certain persons thenceforth called the \" Ten Proprietors.\" These pro prietors admitted 20 other partners termed the \" Twenty Associates,\" among whom were Cornelius and John Waldo of Boston. The Twenty Associates afterwards transferred to the Waldos. 100,000 acres. Under their auspices, 1719-20, two plantations, which subsequently became the thriving towns of Thomaston and Warren, were commenced. This may b< regarded as the first permanent settlement of the patent. In \u2022The remainder of this article is mainly extracted from Crocker and Howard's History of New England, being so complete and yet so succinct that any improvement upon it would be difficult. The author is Albert C. Wiggin."], [565, "WALDO COUNTY. 557 1726, one David Dunbar, who had obtained an appointment styling him \" Surveyor-General of the King's Woods,\" became very aggressive. Samuel Waldo was sent to England to procure a revocation of Dun bar's authority, and in the end succeeded. For this and other valuable services the 30 partners conveyed to him one-half of the whole patent. In 1744 he distinguished himself at the capture of Louisburg, and gained the title of General or Brigadier Waldo. After the accession of General Waldo to so large an interest in the patent, added to what he had inherited of his father's share, about 200,000 acres still belonged to the old proprietors. In 1734 General Waldo contracted with the Twenty Associates to purchase one-half of their shares, leaving them 100,000 acres. This arrangement was not completed until 1768. Gen eral Waldo offered favorable inducements for European immigration, and in 1749, German colonists established the town of Waldoborough. Owing to his influence Fort Pownall, Stockton, was built at a time when no white inhabitant retained a dwelling-place upon the shores of Penobscot River or Belfast Bay. While upon a tour of observation to this portion of his estate, he died suddenly near Bangor, May 23, 1759, at the age of 63 years. A county, two thriving towns, and the lofty elevation of Mount Waldo perpetuate his name. The land descended to the General's four children, Samuel, Francis, Lucy and Hannah. The last named became the wife of Thomas Flucker, secretary of the Province. Flucker afterward purchased the shares belonging to Samuel. Lucy died without children, and her interest fell to the brothers and sisters. Flucker and Francis Waldo were Tories. They removed to England, and their property became forfeited to the State. In 1774, Henry Knox, afterwards a general in the Revolution, married Miss Lucy Flucker,the second daughter of Thomas and Hannah (Waldo) Flucker, and the grand-daughter of General Waldo. When the Rev olution had ended, General Knox purchased four-fifths of the whole patent ; the remainder was the property of his wife. The territory was surveyed, the lines adjusted, and in 1792, General Knox took formal possession of his estate, which then contained only 9 incorpor ated towns. He did much to induce immigration. Sometime before his death \u2014 which occurred in 1806 \u2014 he became involved in pecuniary embarrassments. In 1798 he mortgaged that part of his domain now comprised in Waldo County to General Lincoln and Colonel Jackson, who had been his sureties. This mortgage was, in 1802, assigned to Messrs. Israel Thorndike, David Sears and William Prescott of Boston ; and they foreclosed it. They established a land agency in Belfast in 1809. Many of the land titles in Waldo County are derived through these proprietors. It is not known what price was paid for the mort gage by Thorndike, Sears and Prescott. The valuation of their unsold land in the county was in 1835, $148,000. The lands owned by the original mortgagees are now alienated excepting Brigadier's or Sear's Island in Searsport, \u2014 which is the property of David and Henry F. Sears of Boston, great-grandsons of the first mortgagee. It was not until the year 1759 that a permanent settlement was planted in Waldo County. The British crown had secured and fortified St. John's River, and the enemy had no other outlet to the sea than through the Pen obscot River. Governor Pownall of Massachusetts having called the attention of the legislature to the importance of establishing a forti fication at Penobscot, an expedition, headed by the Governor, proceeded"], [566, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 558 to the region, and began the construction of a fort at Wasaumkeag Point, now Fort Point, within the present limits of Stockton. It was while accompanying a detachment which had ascended the river a few miles above where Brewer now stands, and had taken formal possession of the county for the Province of Massachusetts Bay, that General Samuel Waldo dropped down in a fit of apoplexy, and soon after expired. The deceased general was buried at the \" Point,\" with mili tary honors and religious services, on the evening of May 25, 1759. A sermon, the first in Waldo County, was preached by Rev. Mr. Philips. The fort, completed July 28, 1759, was called Fort Pownall. Until the Revolutionary war a garrison was constantly maintained. General Jedediah Preble, with a force of 84 men, was first placed in command. Both in civil and military life he so distinguished himself as to in scribe his name upon the page of history. He was the father of Com modore Preble, a still more distinguished man. He died at Portland in 1807, at the age of 77. In 1763, General Preble resigned command of the fort, and was succeeded by Col. Thomas Goldthwaite, a native of Chelsea, Massachusetts. He was paymaster in the expedition against Crown Point in 1755. While resident at Fort Pownall he was com missioned as the first justice of the peace in this section. He solem nized the first marriages on the river. In 1770 he was superseded by John Preble, son of the first commander of the fort. But Governor Hutchinson, a zealous royalist, coming into power the following year, he re-instated Goldthwaite into his former office. Being a Tory, Gold thwaite permitted Captain Mowatt, of the British sloop \" Canseau \" to dismantle the fort and take away its defences in 1775. This brought down upon him the wrath of the settlers. The next year all his com missions were revoked, and Goldthwaite joined the British forces. He was drowned during the Revolutionary war by the shipwreck of the vessel in which he had taken passage for Nova Scotia. In July, 1775, the block-house and all the wooden works were burned to the ground for fear that they would be occupied by the enemy to the prejudice of the neighboring inhabitants. The trading-house was kept up until 1777. The remains of the breastwork of Fort Pownall are still to be seen about 25 rods from the water's edge, in front of the present great summer hotel called the Wasaumkeag House. Fort Point is the outer promontory of what is now the town of Stockton, but was the town of Prospect formerly. It rises quite abruptly on the south and east, some 00 or 70 feet from the sea, but on the westerly side a passage opens of easy ascent from the water's edge to the heights above. Looking down the eastern channel of Penobscot Bay, a long artd fine sea-view is had ; while all the towns and villages from Bucksport round nearly to Owl's Head, are distinctly seen. On the old parade ground a growth of trees \u2014 some 18 inches in diameter \u2014 now stands. One of the first centennial celebrations ever held in this country was held at Port Point on the 28th of July, 1859. The number of persons present was estimated to be at least 8,000. When it was found that the garrison at Fort Pownall afforded protection and security, the tide of emigration began to set in the direction of Waldo County. Between 1760 and 1772, all the towns washed by Penobscot waters between Camden and Bangor on the one side, and Castine and Brewer on the other, were penetrated by"], [567, "WALDOBOROUGH. 559 hardy yeomanry, designing here to make a home for themselves and their descendants. AU the towns within the shore limits of the county, except Searsport, Stockton and Winterport, received acts of incor poration between 1773 and 1812. Little did the men who erected Fort Pownall, or the men, who, under its protection, first settled the shores of the Penobscot, apprehend what marvellous changes the suc ceeding century would witness. WaldoborOUgh occupies the middle portion of the east ern side of Lincoln County. The town is longest from north to south. Its area is about 25,376 acres. Nobleboro' and Jefferson bound it on the west, Washington, Union and Warren, in Knox County, bound it on the north and east, Friendship lies on the south-east, and Bremen on the south-west. The southern portion of the town is penetrated by Broad Bay, an extension of Muscongus Bay ; and Medomac River passes through the town from north to south, emptying into Broad Bay. Goose River separates it from Friendship, on the south-west. The principal ponds within its limits are Medomac, and Little Medo mac. Pemaquid and Duck Puddle ponds lie on the western, and Southern and Western ponds on the eastern border. The surface of the town is agreeably diversified. Willett's and Benner's hills are the highest eminences. Granite is the principal outcropping rock. There are many good farms in town, and the soil generally yields well when thoroughly cultivated. Hay and potatoes are the principal crops raised so1- outside markets. The islands belonging to Waldoborough are Upper Narrows, Hog, Poland's, Hadlock, Hungry, Otter, Jones', Garden, and several smaller. The principal village is at the mouth of the Medomac River, a little south of the centre of the town. The productive establishments here consist of an iron foundry, an oakum mill, a carding and cloth-dressing mill, a grain-mill, saw and planing-mills, marble and granite yards, a pottery, ship-yards, furniture and moulding-mills, a door, sash and blind factory, a carriage factory, etc. Waldoborough is on the Knox and Lincoln Railroad, 28 miles from Bath and 16 from Wiscasset. There are some fine buildings in the village, and several handsome residences. Many of the streets are set with shade trees, consisting of maple, elm and horse-chestnut, some of them a hundred years old. There were built in Waldoborough collection district in the year ending June, 1880, eight vessels, having an aggregate tonnage of 5,064.02. Waldoborough was included within Muscongus, or Waldo Patent. It was first settled between 1733 and 1740, by Scotch-Irish and German immigrants, brought in chiefly by the influence of General Waldo. Shortly after the latter date the town was attacked by the Indians, the buildings burned, and the inhabitants tomahawked or carried away captives. In 1748, immediately after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the settlement was revived. In 1752-53, Samuel Waldo, a son of the general, visited Germany, and succeeded in obtaining about 1,500 set tlers from that country. A large part of these settled on the western side of Broad Bay ; but in 1763-4 the lands on this side were claimed by Drowne under the Pemaquid Patent, and Massachusetts finally made Medomac River the western boundary if the Muscongus Patent. The settlers were therefore obliged to buy of Drowne the lands that had been assigned them by Waldo. Very soon after this"], [568, "560 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. claim was satisfied, the Brown claim was extended over the same territory ; and about three hundred of the settlers, disappointed, and discouraged, sold out their property and emigrated to South Carolina. Yet there still remained a large and flourishing colony, of about 80 families which in 1773 was incorporated into a town named in honor of its founder. Conrad Heyer, the first male citizen of Waldoborough, was born in Broad Bay plantation in 1749, and died in 1856, at the age of 106 years, 10 months and 9 days, He served in the Revolutionary war, and was wont to relate his adventures in that struggle with much zest. Waldoborough was made the shire town of the county in 1786, and thus remained until 1880, when the courts were removed to Wis casset. The town was first represented in the General Court in 1780, by Jacob Ludwig, a citizen of German extraction. On the arrival of these German Pilgrims a Lutheran church was at once organized by them, and in 1762 a minister, the Rev. John M, Schaeffer, was settled. His successors up to 1820, were Rev. Mr. Croner, Rev. R. B. Ritz, and Rev. Mr. Starman. The churches are now two Congregational, two Baptist, and four Methodist. There is a small circulating library, and a library of about 1000 volumes, belong ing to the Waldoborough Library Association. The \"Lincoln County News,\" is brisk, vigorous and independent, and withal gives due attention and fair treatment to the affairs of the county. It is edited and published by Samuel L; Miller, Esq. Thurs day is the day of publication. The town has twenty-two public schoolhouses ; which, with other school property, are valued at $14,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,164,382. In 1880, it was $1,135,023. The rate of tax ation in the latter year was 22 mills on the dollar. Waldo National Bank and Medomac National Bank, located in tho village, each have a capital of $50,000. The population in 1870 was 4,174. In 1880, it was 3,759. WaldO Patent. See article on Waldo County. Wales lies 6 miles east of Lewiston, and midway of the eastern side of Androscoggin County. The town of Greene lies on the west, the two being separated from each other in the southern half by Sabattus Pond. Monmouth bounds it on the north, Litchfield on the east, and Webster on the south. The size is four by four and one-half miles, com prising about 7,844 acres. The surface is undulating, except at the south east there is a broad hill known as Oak Hill, and at the south-west the considerable eminence called Sabattus Mountain. This point was occupied in 1853-54 as a statii n of the coast survey. On the south eastern side of the northern spur of the mountain is a low cave which extends back about fifty feet from the entrance. Its width is much less ; and in no part of it can a full grown man stand erect. The rock in which it occurs is a mica-schist highly charged with iron and sul phur. The cave is an extensive fissure formed by the water from rains and melting snows washing through a crevice. It was discovered early in the settlement by a hunter, from a bear of which he was in pursuit taking refuge in it. Both at this and other points on the east ern side of this spur, good specimens of red ochre are found. From top to base of the eminence, between the spurs, are found rich speci-"], [569, "WALES. 561 mens of iron ore, which have been traced to a crumbling bowlder of the drift period in the saddle of the mountain. At the foot, on the western side, lies Sabattus Pond, of which but a small portion is in the town. The name of pond and mountain is derived from an Indian, who about the date of settlement spent much of his time in the vicinity. The soil is good and the industry of the town is almost wholy agri cultural. The Androscoggin division of the Maine Central Railroad passes from north to south at the extreme western side of the town ; and Leeds Junction is at the north-eastern angle. There is a post-office at this point. Wales post-office is about two miles south of this. The other post-office is East Wales. There are no considerable villages ; and the manufactures are small. For the first twelve or fifteen years after the settlement the inhabitants were compelled to carry their bags of corn on their shoulders through the broken woods a distance of nearly twenty miles to have it ground. Joseph Maxwell built the first grist mill at about the year 1800. Later B. C. Jenkins built a saw-mill near Oak Hill ; and about 1842 Benjamin Vining built on a small stream near his residence. The titles to land in the town were derived from the old Plymouth Company. The territory of the town together with that of Monmoath was known prior to 1792, as this Plantation of Wales. At the date mentioned Monmouth was set off; and in 1803 the remainder was organized as a plantation under the old name; choosing as its first officers, Joseph Small, Enoch Strout and Joseph Andrews. The act of incorporation as a town was granted by the General Court in 1816. In 1852 a small portion of Leeds was annexed to Wales. The first settler appears to have been James Ross, who came from Brunswick in 1778, and located on the western side of Sabattus Mountain. About 1780 came Reuben Ham, Jonathan and Alexander Thompson, also from Brunswick. Benjamin and Samuel Waymouth, the Greys, and William Rennick settled before 1785; John Andrew, in 1788; Joseph Small and Bartholomew Jackson, in 1791 : Joseph March and John. Larabee, in 1792; Daniel and Ebenezer Small, in 1793. Joseph, son of Daniel, was taken prisoner by the Indians in 1758, and was car ried to Quebec where he remained a prisoner until that place was cap tured by General Wolfe. The Jenkins brothers settled in the north eastern part of the town, and James Clark and James Wilson in the north-eastern part, in 1793. Captain Enoch Strout, who came from Limington in 1796, was a soldier in the Revolution, and the first militia captain chosen in town. Simeon Ricker, who came about 1790, was also a Revolutionary soldier. Luther and Wentworth Lombard moved from Gorham to the town. Obed Hobbs, Simons Gatchell, Benjamin. Tibbetts and Elijah Morton came about 1796 ; William and Arthur Given, in 1798 ; John and James Witherell, Joseph Maxwell, Rufus and Daniel Marr Benjamin and William Fogg, about 1800; Nathaniel Chase, in 1805; Anthony Woodside and William Swett, about 1806; Josiah Libby came in 1807. Later he kept a public-house, and was a major in the militia and town officer for many years. James Taylor, son of a Revolutionary soldier, was himself a soldier in the war of 1812, and two of his sons were Union soldiers in the war of the Rebel lion. James Hodsdon came in 1815, settling on Sabattus Mountain. Samuel Libby, who removed to Wales in 1824, was a soldier in the war of 1812. Benjamin Sanborn came into town about 1849, and Jona than Reynes, in 1843."], [570, "562 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. The first meeting-house stood near the centre of the town, and was a Union house. In 1826, a Free Baptist church was organized under the direction of Elder Aliezer Bridges ; who in 1831 was succeeded by Rev. Allen Files, as pastor. The house was taken down in 1854, and rebuilt on the Pond road. It is used as a Union house by the Free Baptists, Methodists and Baptists. Captain Joseph Small built the first school in town. He was fol lowed by Arthur Given, Daniel Evans, Fayette Mace, Richard Elder, Joel Small and Enoch Strout. Wales now has eight public school houses, valued at $2,300. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $229, 359. In 1880 it was $198,578. The population at the same date was 556. In 1880, it was 505. WallagTaSS Plantation lies in the north-eastern party of Aroostook County. It is bounded on the north by Fort Kent, south by Eagle Lake Plantation, and west by St. John Plantation. Fish River runs northward through the eastern part of the township, receiving about midway of its course Wallagrass Stream, whose branches gather from the whole western half of the town, north and south. The principal settlements are on the west side of Fish River, along the road from Ashland through Eagle Lake Plantation to Fort Kent. This plantation was settled by Canadian French. The religion is Roman Catholic. The public schoolhouses are three in number, valued at $300. The population in 1870 was 297. In 1880 it was 431, of whom 85 were taxable polls. The valuation in 1880 was $22,040. Walnut Hill,\u2014 a railroad station in North Yarmouth, Cumberland County. Waltham is situated on the eastern .side of the Union River, and is near the centre of Hancock County. Its south-west corner approaches Ellsworth, and Mariaville is the adjoining town on the north and west. The town was carved out of Mariaville, and incorporated in 1833. It was named for Walthari, Mass. Its first settlers were Samuel Ingalls, Eben Jordan, Lebbeus and Eben Kingman, who came in 1805. The north-eastern portion of the town is thickly strewn with gigan tic bowlders. Marine shells and petrified forms of plants and animals are frequently turned up by the plow. The pretty village flat at Hast ings bridge has the appearance of having been a lake bottom not many centuries since. In Cave Hill is a considerable cavern, in which three rooms have been explored. The rocks here are said to be of the same family and age as those in Orland where caves occur. The rocks there are supposed to be of the Mountain Limestone period, and are interspersed with basalt. The prevailing rock in town is said to be slate and quartz. Waltham has a soil well fitted for potatoes and for apple orchards. The principal crop is hay and potatoes. Webb's Brook, the outlet of Webb's, Seammon's, Abramsand Molasses ponds, affords a valuable water-power. There is one mill for the manufacture of staves and shingles. Waltham sent 37 men into the service of the Union during the"], [571, "W.iRREN. 563 Rebellion. The Baptists have a society and a church edifice in the town. The number of public schoolhouses is four ; and the school property is valued at $1,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $57,727. In 1880 it was $78,154. The rate of taxation in 1880 was nine mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 366. In tho census of 1880 it was 296. WaltOn'S MlllS,\u2014 a small village in Mount Vernon, Ken nebec County, the same as West Mount Vernon post-office. Warren, one of the western towns of Knox County, is situated upon the St. George's River, which passes through it from north to south, dividing it into nearly equal sections. Other streams are Back River and the outlets of North and South, Crawford and White Oak ponds. The first of these ponds has an area of about one half a square mile, and the second of about one square mile. The area of the town is near 27,000 square acres. The surface is quite broken, with many hills, the highest of which are Mount Pleasant and Congress Mountain. The first of these affords an ex tensive view of the ocean and of Penobscot Bay. The soil of the town is variable \u2014 chiefly clay loam, and rewards well the labors of the husbandman. The chief crop for market is hay. Limestone is the principal bed-rock, though there is some granite, both of which are quarried. There was formerly a large quantity of lime made in the town, and the industry is still followed to some extent. The coast ing trade was formerly much pursued, but has been mostly abandoned. Ship-building, also, was formerly a leading industry. Between the years of 1770 and 1850 there were built here 224 vessels, varying from fifty to above 1,000 tons burthen This business too, has now fallen off. The principal manufactures at rreaent are woollens, by the Georges River Mills ; snow-shoes, by the Warren Shoe Factory, each employing nearly 100 hands, and E. Wason, powder. The three prin cipal villages are known as Warren, and North and South Warren, The station of the Knox and Lincoln railroad in this town is 12 miles west of Rockland. Warren was originally known as the Upper-town of St. George, and belonged to the Muscongus, afterward the Waldo Patent. The settlement was begun under the auspices of General Waldo, the pro prietor, in 1736. At this time, says Eaton, \" with the exception of a trading-house, mill and fort, wnhh had been erected on the lanks of the St. George one hundred and twenty-five years previous, no marks of civilization existed, and no inroads were made upon that unbroken forest, which over the whole county sheltered the moose and tho Indian alike from the scorching suns of summer and the howling storms of winter. Having made a favorable arrangement with the proprietor. Waldo, forty-seven persons, in the summer of 1736, located themselves here. Waldo furnished them with provisions, and they occupied themselves principally in getting out staves and cord-wood, varied with hunting and fishim\" In 1752, there was an arrival of German emigrants ; and in subsequent years mor;j of these, with English, Scotch and Irish, augmented the number ot inhabitants.

Gen. Ellis Spear, recently commis sioner of patents, is a native of Warren and a descendant of an early settler. In 1752, another colony brought 20 Scottish families, being among others the following names, now closely identified with the history of the town. Anderson, Dicke, Crawford, Malcolm and Kirk patrick. The name Stirling which they gave their village still adheres to the locality. Great numbers of shad and alewivcs were formerly caught in the St. George's and its branches in this town, yielding quite a revenue. The natives marked a tree near the first falls and forbade the English to fish above it. The transgression of this edict was one of the causes of the hostility of the Indians. Warren was incorporated in 1776, taking its name from Gen. Joseph Warren, who h: d then recently fallen at Bunker Hill. It was first represented in the General Court in 1779, by Moses Copeland, Esq. ; later, by Samuel S. Wilde and Samuel Thatcher ; Henry Alexander, elected in 1788-9, was the first captain of the plantation militia. His successor was Thomas Kilpatrick, who had charge of the block-house, built in 1753 above the fort. In 1754, the settlers were driven by the Indians to take refuge in these defences, and others in Cushing. The town records commence and continue unbroken from 1777. They show that tho inhabitants were the active and bold friends of liberty. The first post-office in town was established in 1794; the first meeting house, in 1793; and one was built by the Baptists in 1806. Rev. Robert Rutherford preached several years to this people prior to 1756. Rev. John Urquhart, was the first settled minister. He was dismissed in 1782-3 ; being succeeded by Rev. Jonathan Huse, ordained 1795. The first bridge over the river was built in 1780 ; another at the head of the tide was built in 1790-1. The first -saw-mill was built in 1785. A court house war, erected and courts established there in 1799. Among the eminent citizens of the modern period are Hon. Edwin Smith, Oscar Eaton, Esq., Dr. B. F. Burton and Cyrus Eaton, the historian. An account of this rown or of the county would be incomplete without a sketch of the latter. Cyrus Eaton was born at Framingham, Mass., in 1784 coming to Maine as a teacher of music at the age of 20 yeair. He 3ettled in Warren, and subsequently by unre mitting application became \u2014 unaided by teachers \u2014 a very learned man, a proficient in various branches of science, and master of several lan guages. In 1843 he became blind, and assisted by his invalid daughter as amanuensis, turned his attention to writing the town histories of this central region of Maine, for which he had been for many years collect ing materials. \" For accuracy, elegance of style and general merit, uis works have seldom been equalled in their department of literature. Mr. Eaton received distinguished honors from various institutions and learned societies in recognition of his historical and other literary labors.\" * The church edifices belong to the Congregationalists and Baptists. There is a public library of about 500 volumes. The town sustains an excellent high-school. The number of public school houses is nineteen ; and the school property is valued at $9,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $834,610. In 1880 it was $789,820. The population in 1870 was 1,974.

Marysville and Caribou lie on the east. Caribou Lake, in the north eastern part, is the largest sheet of water, but there are several small ponds scattered over the town. There is one saw-mill, run by water power, for manufacturing long and short lumber, and one for shingles. There are two mills manufacturing shingles, and a furniture factory run by steam. The underlying rock in this town is limestone. The surface is rolling, and without high hills. The soil is a sandy loam, and at present potatoes are found to be the most profitable crop for money returns. Cedar, spruce, birch and maple constitute the woods. The bridge across the Aroostook in the western part of the town is 75 feet in length. The nearest railroad station is at Caribou, 12 miles from the principal settlement in Washburn. This town was surveyed by W. P. Parrott in 1842. Nathaniel Churchill was the foremost man of the first colony, which settled here about 18-^9. The town was incorporated February 25, 1861 ; being named in honor of Governor Washburn. The Baptists have a minis ter resident in the town. The number of public schoolhouses is six.

It is bounded on the south by Waldoboro and Jefferson, east by Union, west by Somerville in Lincoln County, and north by Palermo and Liberty in Waldo County, and Appleton in Knox County. It contains two considerable ponds, Washington and Clark's ; the first having an area of 800 and the last of 350 square acres. The streams are Damariscotta River, which bisects the town from north to south, and the outlet of Clark's Ponds and of Washington Pond, \u2014 the last con stituting Muscongus River. The surface of the town is uneven and in some parts rocky. Patricktown Mountain, in the north-western part, is the greatest elevation. The soil is productive, and the inhabi tants are generally thrifty. Washington, the chief business centre, is about 35 miles easterly of Augusta, and 22 miles north-west of Rock land. It is on the stage-line from Augusta to Rockjand and to Belfast. The post offices are North and West Washington. The products of manufacture are boots and shoes, barrels and casks, cabinet-work, lumber (two mills), staves, harnesses, flour and meal, etc. Washington was in part included in the Plymouth and in part in the Muscongus (subsequently called the Waldo) patent. The town was made up of the westerly part of Union and several strips and gores adjacent, and was incorporated in 1811, under the name of Putnam. Among the petitioners for incorporation were Mark Hatch, John and James Laughton, John Bowmin, David Colamy, Benjamin Speed, William Starrett, Thomas Nelson, James Daggett, Samuel Stickney and Sanford Rhoades.

Its western boundary was the eastern line of Hancock. It was bounded \" south and south-east by the sea or western ocean, on the north by the utmost northern limits of this commonwealth, and easterly by the river St. Croix.\" In 1839 it surrendered to Aroostook County \u2014 established at that date \u2014 all the territory \"north of the north line of the fourth range of townships, north of the 'lottery townships.'\" The area of the county is about 2,700 square miles. It has about 180 miles of sea-coast, abounding in bays and inlets which afford excellent harbors. The principal rivers are the St. Croix and its west branch, the Schoodic, Denny's, East and West Machias, Pleasant and the Narraguagus. Of its numerous lakes, the largest are the Schoodic series, Baskahegan, Meddybemps and Gardner's. The surface is gradually undulating or varied by swells of no great height, and the soil back from the sea shore is usually fertile. Probably the first European visitor of Maine was Capt. John Rut and his crew of the English vessel called \" The Mary of Guilford,\" in 1527, when he reconnoitred along our shores, sailing westerly from Liverpool, N.S. The next of whose landing place we have definite knowledge was DeMonts, in 1603, who erected a fort and buildings and passed the succeeding winter on an island at the mouth of the St. Croix River. This is now known as Neutral Island. By him it was named St. Croix ; and from this, probably, the river has acquired its name. His company was composed of Roman Catholics and Huguenots, or French Piotestants, in about equal numbers; himself belonging to the first, as well as his chaplain. Here was preached the first European sermon in New England. \" There is no authentic record,\" says the historian of Washington County,* \" of a settlement by whites on Machias River prior to June, 1763. Richard Vines, however, set up a trading-house on the west side of Machias River, near Clark's Point, now Machiasport, in 1632 or 1633, leaving it in charge of five men. In less than one month, La Tour, a French explorer, deputy and proprietor in Nova Scotia, seized the whole stock of Vines' trading-house, made prisoners of the men and sent the whole to France. The French planted a few habitations here in 1644, but were unsuccessful; and a similar attempt in 1674 also resulted in failure. In 1748 Richard Hazen was employed by the Governor of Massachusetts to make surveys and form a chart and plan of the coast. About 1753 Florentius Vassal, a resident of the island of Jamaica, proposed that Massachusetts should transfer the territory between St. Croix and Penobscot to him and his associates, on certain conditions of settlement. The legislative branches of the government assured him that if he would, within five years, obtain his Majesty's approbation, introduce 5,000 settlers, a proportionate number of Pro testant clergyman, and satisfy Indian claims, the emigrants should \u2022Geo.

In 1760 a similar proposition was made to Massachusetts by the Earl of Castlereagh and Francis Vassal in regard to lands upon Machias River, but nothing was done. About this time the King authorized the General Court of Massachusetts to make free giants of land to those officers and privates who had served in the French and Indian wars, just terminated. A captain was to receive 3,000, a subaltern 2,000, and a private 500 acres. After the downfall of the French power in the north, in 1760, the Indians manifested a disposition to maintain peace and amity with the settlers, and to the present time this friendship has not been in terrupted. The rivers of this county are noted for their falls, and their ample lake reservoirs, forming abundant water-power. They were heavily tim bered to their sources, and their extensive areas have been diked and reclaimed from the waters and made valuable hay-producing lands. The bottom lands are rich, and there are many large tracts of fine arable soil, which ars bearing heavy crops of corn, wheat, hay and potatoes. The rivers are prolific in pickerel, trout, togue, perch, and salmon. The sea fisheries are extensive and profitable, employing a large capital and great numbers of men and boys. The granite business is receiving increased attention, and excellent quarries are being wrought at Addison, Jonesborough, Marshfield, and Red Beach in Calais. Machias, the shire-town of this county from its inauguration, is also the oldest town. By an act of Congress in 1789, all the coasts and ports of Maine were classed in nine commercial districts, in each of which a collector and other customs officers were appointed by Pre sident Washington. Machias was made a port of entry, Stephen Smith being appointed first collector. From the earliest settlement of the county its people have been largely engaged in building vessels, mostly of a small size, suitable for coasting and fisheries. In 1873, 9,482 tons of shipping were built in the Machias district. In 1856, 17 vessels, ranging from 100 to 1000 tons each, were built at Robbinston. Pembroke, Calais, East Machias, Lubec, Millbridge, Columbia Falls and Addison are ship-building towns. Washington Plantation is situated in the southern part of Franklin County. It is bounded north by Perkins Plantation, east by Temple, south by Wilton, and west by Perkins Plantation and Carthage. The dimensions of the territory are three miles north and south by one and one half east and west. There is one lofty hill in the western part of the township, the termination of a range approaching from the south-west. The outlet of a pond in Perkins Plantation ruus southward through the eastern part of the township. The plantation is 6 miles north-west of Wilton, on a stage-fine. Washington Plantation was formerly township No. 4. The organization is now given up. The valuation in 1870 was $6,000. The population at the same date w-as 62- In 1880 it was 32.

The area is 26,491 acres. Water borough was part of the purchase made by Major William Phillips, of Saco, in 1661, of the Indian chiefs, Captain Sunday, Fluellen and Hobinowell. By virtue of the will of Major Phillips' widow, John Avery, Colonel Joshua Waters and John Wheelwright, of Boston, be came proprietors ; and the town took its name from Colonel Waters. The first permanent settlement was by John Smith, in 1768, near Waterborough Old Corners. Prior to its incorporation (in 1787), the town was included with the northern part of Alfred under the name of Massabesic Plantation. The Court of General Sessions, which filled the place of the County Commissioners' Court, was removed to Waterborough in 1790, and a cour'-house built south of the Old Corners in the forks of a road. In 1805 the court was removed to Alfred. The first hotel in town was about a mile south of the Old Corners. It was opened by Samuel Dam, who came from Durham, N.H., about 1780. Mr. Dam built the first grist-mill in Newfield Village. The first church was formed in 1782. It was a Union church, and its meetings were held at dwellings. The second was a Baptist church, organized in 1791. In 1794 Rev. Henry Smith became its pastor, and continued there until his death, in 1836. The third church was a Free-will Baptist, organized by Rev. Henry Hobbs, in 1798. The first school in town was held in a bam, in 17b4, and was taught by Samuel Robinson. The number of public school houses in the town at this time is twelve ; and their estimated value is $8,000. A few of the most notable names of natives or citizens are .Dr. James II. Pierce, Ira J. Drew, B. F. Hamilton, Abel Jellison, Amos F. Allen, Chas. F. Leavitt, Dr. Jefferson Smith, Dr. Dryden Smith, Revs. John Ilaines, Stephen Webber, Timothy Hodgdon and Frank K. Roberts. The town has five post-offices, South Center, Ossipee Mills, North and East Waterborough. The chief pond is the Little Ossipee, which contains about a thousand acres. The Little Ossipee River bounds the town on the north and affords several good water-powers. The outlet of Little Ossipee Pond affords the best power in town, running four saws and a planer. There are two powers on Branch Brook capable of running three-fourths of the year. Smith's Brook runs two saws through the year. Down's Brook affords a good privilege, but is not occupied. Robert's Brook, sufficient to run one saw for half the year, is now occupied with a steam mill. The Ossipee Manufacturing Com pany, Ossipee Mills, on the Little Ossipee, employs 25 hands, manufac tures 18,000 pairs of blankets annually, the business amounting to $63,000.. The Steam Mill Company at South Waterborough manufactures large quantities of lumber into boxes, shingles, and similar articles. The Ossipee Pond Company, at the outlet, also manufacture lumber. The amount annually manufactured in town is about 1,800,000 feet. Waterborough ranks high as an agricultural town, though better adapted for grazing than for crops. One farm keeps a stock of forty head of neat cattle and horses. The roads are good. One hundred and eighty-four men were enlisted from the town during the war of the Rebellion. Bounties were paid to the amount of $46,270.61 ; and to soldier's families, $5,535.74; contributions for soldier's relief, $900."], [577, "TT^l TERFORD. 569 The surface of the town is uneven. Large swells or ridges run through it in nearly a northerly and southerly direction, with tracts of sandy land lying between. The ridges are largely covered with white, red and yellow oak, beech, birch, maple, pine and hemlock. The plains abound in white and yellow pine, interspersed with hard wood of the varieties mentioned. Ossipee Mountain, near the centre of the town, is with one exception, the highest land in the county, and is a station of the United States Coast Survey. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $364,270. In 1880 it was $373,580. The population at the same date was 1,542 ; in 1880, 1,482. The rate of taxation for 1880 is two and a half mills on the dollar. Waterford lies in the southern part of the broad middle section of Oxford County. The township is almost square, with angles marking nearly the points of the compass. Norway bounds it on the north-east, Albany and Stoneham on the north-west, Sweden and Lovell on the south-west, and Harrison and Bridgton in Cumberland County, on the south-east. Crooked River enters the town on the north-west side and leaves it at the south-eastern angle in its course completely exemplifying its name. Extending across the southern portion of the town is a range of ponds, bearing the names of Long, Thomas, Bear and Moose. At the western angle, lies Kezar Pond, Island Pond, lies near the southern angle, Pappoose Pond near Crooked River in the north-eastern part, Bog Pond a little south-east of Thomas Pond, Chapin Pond at the north of Kezar, and Duck Pond on the south-western side of the town. These vary in size from 484 to 50 acres, in the order in which they are mentioned. In the southern part of the town is a range of three considerable eminences, of which the highest have the names of Bear aud Hawk mountains. In the western part of the town Beek Hill stands solitary and beautiful. On the outlet of Bear Pond, and near Hawk Mountain, are a saw-mill, grist-mill, a clothes-pin factory, and a hotel. Waterford post-office and the town-house are at \" Waterford Flat,\" on the western side of Thomas Pond. South Waterford post-office (\" Waterford City,\") is on the stream connecting Thomas and Bear ponds. East Waterford post-office (\" Rice's Junction\"), is between Crooked River and Long Pond, on the outlet of the latter. North Waterford is situated on Crooked River near the north-western side of the town. At Waterford Flat are a tannery and Shattuck's Hygienic Institu tion; at North Waterford are a lumber-mill, a sash-mill, a grist mill and a tannery ; at South Waterford are a lumber and grist-mill, a stave-mill, a salt-box, dry-bucket and carriage factories. The surface of the town is uneven and has much beautiful scenery, especially about the the southern ponds. The roads are excellent, and nowhere are more enjoyable drives to be found than in this town. It is 13 miles from the Grand Trunk Railroad station at South Paris, on a stage-line from that place to Fryeburg. Waterford was surveyed in 1774. The first settler was David Mc- Wayne, who took up his residence here alone in 1775. So fond was he of utter solitude that he appeared very much annoyed when, three years later, a clearing was commenced on what is now known as Paris Hill, 12 or 15 miles away. Eleazer Hamlin, father of Dr. Cyrus, and grand-father of Hon. Hannibal Hamlin, was an early settler, as were"], [578, "TICONIO FALLS, WATEEVILLE AND WINSLOW, ME."], [579, "WATERVILLE. 571 also his three brothers. Five or six Brown brothers, and the four fam ilies of Jewett, Saunders, Chaplin and Greene also came early. Prof. William W. Greene, M.D., distinguished as a surgeon, was a native of Waterford. The titles to the lands were principally from Jonathan Houghton, Henry Gardiner, David Sampson, Jonathan Whitcomb, chief proprietors. The town was incorporated March 2, 1797. An Orthodox minister was settled in 1799, and a militia company formed in the same year. At present there are two Congregational churches and one Methodist church in the town. The number of public schoolhouses is fourteen ; and the school-property is valued at $7,000. The population in 1870 was 1,286 ; polls, 333. In 1880 it was 1,161, with 349 polls. The valu ation in 1870 was $403,651. In 1880 it was $338,987. Waterville lies on the western bank of the Kennebee River, adjoining Fairfield, in Somerset County, on the north. Winslow lies opposite on the east side of the river, Sidney forms the southern bound ary, and West Waterville, the western. The town is 6 miles long, and about 2 in width. It is 18 miles from Augusta, and 80 from Portland. The eastern and western lines of the Maine Central railway form a junction at the village ; and extensive repair shops of the railroad company are there located. The principal stream in town is the Messalonske, which furnishes power near the village for several manu factories, among which are a grist-mill, a sash and blind factory, a shovel-handle factory, a tannery, a boot and shoe-shank factory, etc. On the Kennebec are two large cotton factories of the Lockwood Com pany, and one or two saw-mills. The surface of the town is little varied by hills, the soil being largely alluvial. The village itself is built along rambling streets shaded by elms on a broad plain above the river, where are many pleasant res idences, and several with park-like grounds. Near the railway station, are the buildings of Colby University, two of them elegant structures of stone, and the remainder of brick. The grounds, which descend to the river in successive terraces, are well shaded about the buildings by elms, and below by native trees and shrubbery. The flowing river, and the high shore opposite form an attractive background The new building for the scientific department is of granite ; and, with the usual illustrative cabinets, it has a fine one of birds. It is believed that its collection of native birds is the best in the State. On the other wing of the line of buildings is the stone chapel, of variegated colors and surmounted by a tower. The lower part of the edifice is occupied by an excellent modern library of some 14,000 volumes. The upper floor, termed the Memorial Hall, is used as a chapel. It is ornamented with an adaptation in marble, by Milmore, of Thorwaldsen's Lion at Lucerne. The work is wrought from a single marble block, and rep resents a lion at the mouth of a cave pierced by a spear. The counte nance of the king of beasts shows an agonizing appearance, which bor rows much of its expression from the face of the human being. Below this beautiful work is a marble tablet containing the names of twenty former students who fell in the war for the Union. This institution was first organized and incorporated in 1813, and was endowed in that year by the State with two townships of timber land on the Penobscot.

The first grad uates were George Dana Boardman and Ephraim Tripp, the former becoming a missionary to India. Having in 1867 received a large endowment from Gardner Colby, a wealthy gentleman of Boston, an act of legislation was procured, changing its name to Colby University. The institution is under the control of the Baptist denomination. Rev. Dr. J. T. Champlin was its president for many years, and its present flourishing condition is largely due to his untiring efforts. He is worthily succeeded by Henry E. Robins, D.D. The principal fitting school for Colby University is the Classical Institute in this village, which has long been considered one of our best academies. Waterville was formerly a part of Winslow, but was set off and incorporated in 1802, the dividing line being the Kennebec River. The locality of the falls was known to the Indians and early inhab stants as Tacconnet, since become the more euphonious Ticonic. The first mill was erected hero on the lower fall in 1784 by Samuel Reding ton ; a portion of the funds for this enterprise being furnished by the heirs of Dr. John McKechnie, formerly of Winslow, and a part by Mr. Gatchell, the father of Mr. Redington's wife. Another early settler was James Stackpole, who married a daughter of Dr. McKechnie. Waterville has three national banks, the Ticonic, Merchant's and People's National ; and one Savings-bank. The Waterville Mail, pub lished every Friday by Maxham and Wing, has long been reputed and deservedly, as being a sheet of sterling value. The Colby Echo, pub lished every month by the students of the University, well sustains its place among college publications. There are now congregations of Baptists, Congregationalists, Uni tarians, Methodists, Universalists, Episcopalians and Roman Catholics in town, most of whom own good houses of worship. Waterville has nine public schoolhouses, valued at $20,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,904,017. In 1880 it was $2,612,496. The population in 1870 was 4,852. By the census of 1880 it was given at 4,672. is one of the most wealthy towns in Kennebec County. It is bounded by Readfield and Winthrop on the east, Fayette on the north, Monmouth on the south, and by Leeds, in Androscoggin County on the south and west. The form of the town is triangular, being broadest at the northern part. About one-third of its surface is water, there being partly or wholly within its limits six ponds of considerable size. The largest of these, Androscoggin Pond, lying on the south west side, contains 5.75 square miles. Wing's Pond, near the middle of the town, has an area of about one square mile. The Androscoggin Pond empties into the Androscoggin, and is the last of a series of more th in a dozen ponds, the first of which lie in the northern part of Vienna. Wilson's Pond, having an area of .90 of a square mile, forms a part of the south-eastern boundary of the town. At North Wayne, on the stream connecting Lovejoy's with Wing's Pond, are the mills of the North Wayne Paper Company ; which, with the dwelling-houses and other buildings belonging to the company, constitute a pleasant little village. At Wayne village, on the stream connecting Wayne and Androscoggin ponds, are a\" woollen factory, a grist-mill, a shovel handle factory, and a sash and blind factory. Other manufactures at this place are carriages and tinware, machinery and harrows, and marble"], [582, "574 GAZETEEER OF MAINE. and granite works. The place is connected by a stage-line with the Maine Central railway at Winthrop. In the north the soil is sandy, in some parts clayey ; in the south the soil is gravelly and the surface hilly. The prevailing rock is granite. The town abounds in bowlders, some of great size. The principal crop is hay. The roads over Morrison's Hill affords some fine views. At points on the western side the scene afforded by a drive is most impressive and beautiful. At some points the bill rises far and steep above the road while on the other it descends with equal steepness down hundreds of feet to the waters of the pond, here dark and shadowy, there glowing with colors or sparkling with wavelets. Of the two small islands in the pond, one is known to have been an Indian burial place. Job Fuller, who is believed to have been the first settler, made im provements here as early as 1773. The eastern part was included in the Plymouth proprietary, but the titles of the residue were from Massachusetts. Among the early settlers were the Fullers, Wings, Norrises, Besses, Lawrences, S:u (levants, Washbumes, Maxims, Dex ters, Frosts and Bowles. The place was first named Pocasset, and afterward New Sandwich, until its incorporation, in 1798. It was then named for Anthony Wayne, one of Washington's generals. The famous songstress, Annie Louise Cary, was formerly a resident of the town. The Methodists have two churches, and the Baptists and Free Bap tists, one each. Wayne has a high-school ; and her public school houses number nine, and are valued at $6,500. The valuation in 1870 was $344,692; in 1880, $338,802. The population in 1870 was 938; in 1880, 950. Wehb'S MillS,\u2014 a post-office and village in Casco, Cum berland County. WehsteiT* is situated in the south-eastern side of Androscog gin Countv, and joins Lewiston on the west. Lisbon bounds it on the south, Bowdoin on the east, and Wales and Litchfield on the north. The town is nearly square, and has an area of about 12,000 acres. A portion of Sabattus Pond lies in its northern part, and its outlet bear ing the same name runs through the western part of the town. This stream has several falls within the limits of the town, which are im proved as water-powers. At Sabattusville near the pond are two woollen-factories, an excelsior-mill, and two lumber-mills. The first mill at this point appears to have been the saw and grist mill built by Robert II. Niles and Robert Ross above eighty years ago. These were rebuilt in 1844, by Messrs. Lombard and Watts. Sabattusville -is the only village, except a small cluster of houses at Webster Post-Office, in the southern part of the town. The Andro scoggin division of the Maine Central Railroad runs through Sabattus ville and along the pond at the north-western angle of the town. The surface of the country is much varied by hills and valleys, but there are no lofty eminences. Robinson and Hedgehog \" mountains \" and Pettengill, Jordan and Oak hills are the chief of these.

Web ster was originally a part of the town of Bowdoin, but was included in the territory separated and incorporated as Thompsonborough, af terward re-named Lisbon. This territory was divided in 1840, and the northern portion incorporated as the town of Webster. The first settler was Robert Ross, who came from Brunswick, and located on the brook that bears his name, in 1774. Timothy Wey mouth moved in soon after, and built the first mill in town for Jesse Davies. The first justice of the peace was Samuel Tebbetts, and the next was Noah Jordan. The first resident physician was Dr. Ithamar Bellows ; the first lawyer who remained permanently was Jacob Hill, a graduate of Brown University, and sometime editor of the Portland Advertiser. Benjamin Burgess, another resident, was a major-general in the militia, and subsequently sheriff of Lincoln County. Hon. Freeman H. Morse, sometime member of Congress from the second district, and later United States consul at London, was a native of Webster. At the close of the Revolutionary war, a number of the soldiers settled in Webster, of whom were Alexander Gray, Abel Nutting, Aaron Dwinel, Paul Nowell, Simeon Ricker, Foster Wentworth, Elias Stover, Phineas Spofford, Jesse Davies, Captain James Curtis and Samuel Simmons. The latter was one of the first school teachers in town, and was the ancestor of Frank Simmons, the sculptor, who is a native ot Webster. In the war of the Rebellion the town furnished its full quotas under all the calls. The first religious society formed in Webster was of the Baptist persuasion and arose from the labors of Rev. Ichabod Temple, of Bowdoin. Their church was built upon the elevated land in the north-western part of the town. The first minister settled over it was Rev. Mr. Hooper. Their new house is at Sabattusville. The Free Baptists built their church in 1840 ; the bell being a gift from Captain Luther L. Lombard. These, together with a church at the southern border of the town built by Baptists and Universalists, constitute th \u2022 present visible fortifications of the town against the hosts of Satan. Webster has eleven public schoolhouses, valued at $2,400. Th valuation in 1870 was $4('6 434. In 1880 it was $445,353. The pop ulation in 1870 was 939. In 1880 it was 980.

Weld is situated in the southwestern part of Franklin County, having as boundaries, Phillips and Number Six on the north, Avon and Temple on the east, Carthage and Perkins Plantation on the south. The area is 48 square miles. The town is almost surrounded by mountains, either within its limits, or just outside. There is a group of three at the north east corner, of which the highest is Black Mountain. In the eastern part are Centre and Hedgehog hills, with other high hills in the southern and western portion. Just over the eastern border are Blue Mountain and Little Blue, the former 2,804 feet in height. In the broad plain-like valley forming the middle por tion of the town is Webb's Pond, whose outlet is Webb's River, emptying into the Androscoggin at Dixfield village. The scenery of the town, by reason of these features, is very beautiful and noble. The rock is principally gneissic. The soil, in general, is a gravelly loam. In the forests thrive the usual variety of trees native to the middle region of Maine. Corn, potatoes, wheat and oats are all cultivated profitably, and apple orchards are numerous and prolific. The town has two villages, Weld Upper Village, near the head of the pond, and Weld Lower Village, about two miles distant nearer the foot, \u2014 both on the eastern side. Both partake of the general beauty of the town. In these places are a spool-factory, employing about 25 hands in summer and 40 in winter ; five saw-mills, employing about 20 hands, and three box-mills, with 25 hands most of the year. Both steam and water-power are used. Other manufactures are fork and shovel-handles, butter-tubs, harnesses, tinware, etc. The villages are about 16 miles west of Farmington, and are connected by stage with the Maine Central Railroad at Wilton, about 12 miles distant from the lower village. Weld was settled about 1800. Nathaniel Kittredge, Caleb Holt, Janus Houghton, Abel Holt, Joseph and Abel Russell were of the first settlers. The township was surveyed by Samuel Titcomb, for the State. It was lotted by Philip Bullen in 1797. Jonathan Philips, of Boston, was the purchaser from the State. Jacob Abbot and Ben jamin Weld, in 1815, purchased Mr. Philip's unsold lands in Maine, and commenced the sale to settlers. Mr. Abbott also engaged in the settlement of other towns, and procured the location of the Coos road, by the State. It ran from Chesterville through Wilton, Carthage and Weld, passing the notch by Mount Metallic, thence through Byron and East Andover to New Hampshire. Mr. Weld was of Boston ;"], [585, "WELLS. 577 .\"\".rr. Abbot was from Wilton, N. H., but removed to Brunswick, Me., where he died in 1820, aged seventy-four years. He was succeeded in the business of settling his lands by his son, Jacob Abbot, who died in Farmington in 1847, at the age of seventy. Weld is the birth-place of the publisher of this work, who still cherishes a warm regard for his childhood's home, shown by his kindly interest in all that relates to the town. The town was incorporated in 1816, and derived its name from Mr. Weld, one of the owners. It had previously been known as Webb's Pond Plantation. Dr. L. Perkins was one of the most esteemed of the former citizens. The first preaching appears to have been by Rev. Lemuel Jackson of Greene, in 1804; and a Baptist church was constituted in 1809. There are now a Congregational church, and one occupied by both the Free Baptists and Methodists. Weld has eleven public schoolhouses, valued with other school property at $4,000. The valuation in 1870 was $245,260. In 1880 it was $231,911. The population in 1870 was 1,130. In 1880 it was 1,040. Wellington is the south-western town of Piscataquis County. The towns about it are Kingsbury on the north, Parkman in the same county and Cambridge on the east, Harmony on the south, and Brighton on the east, \u2014 the three last being in Somerset County. Its area is 23,120 acres. The town is quite uneven, with several high hills, \u2014 the highest of which is Ball Mountain, situated in the northern part. Higgin's Stream, which runs through the northern part of the town, has four mill privileges, of which three are improved by saw and grist-mills. A branch of this stream also has a mill, and Carle ton's Brook near the north-east corner of the town is made use of for running one or more. The territory of Wellington was a part of the Bingham Purchase. Until its incorporation the plantation was called Bridgetown, from an early proprietor. The first settler was James Knowles, who moved into the western part of the township in 1814. David Staples came soon after, and the next-year J. B. Porter and John Ward joined them. In 1819 or 1820 a settlement was begun on- the east side of the town ship, adjoining Parkman, and in 1821 came Mr. Isaac Hutchings, ever after a prominent citizen. At quite an early period John Davis built a saw-mill at Wellington Corner, adding a grist-mill soon after. John and Colton Weeks also put up a mill on the same stream, and in 1826 Henry Carleton built a saw-mill on the brook still bearing his surname. In 1828 the town of Wellington was incorporated, and Mr. Carleton was town clerk and selectman for several years. There is a flourishing Free Baptist society in town. Wellington has eight schoolhouses, valued at $600. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $119,269; in 1880, $116,712. The population in 1870 was 683. In 1880 it was 647. Wells, situated upon the sea-coast, in York County, was first settled by persons from Exeter, N.H., about the year 1840. Its name' is supposed to have come from Wells in England. In regard to land titles, Folsom says that an Indian named Thomas Chabinoke, devised all his title and interest to Namps-cas-coke (being the greatest part 7"], [586, "578 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. of Wells) to John Wadlow or Wadleigh, upon condition that he should allow one bushel of Indian corn annually to \"Old Webb,\" his mother. This title proved valid. In 1G41, Sir Ferdinando Gorges presented 5,000 acres of it to Thomas Gorges, deputy-governor of his Province of Maine and mayor of tJorgeana, for a manory. He chose a tract near Ogunquit River in the south-west part of the town. About 400 or 500 acres of this was conveyed by deputy Gorges, in 1643, to Rev. John Wheelwright (brother-in-law of the noted Ann Hutchinson), who had been banished from Massachusetts for his Antinomian principles. Another grant was made by Gorges, July 14, 1643, to Wheelwright, Henry Boad and others. When Wheelwright settled hereabout 1643, Edmund Littlefield had already erected a saw-mill, on Webhannet River. The town was incorporated in 1653, being the third in Maine. Its Indian name was Webhannet. It included Kennebunk until 1820, when that portion was set off. It then acquired its present bound- aries, having Sanford and Kennebunk on the north, the latter and the ocean on the east and south-east, York and South Berwick on the south, and South Berwick and North Berwick on the west. The number of acres of land is stated in the county atlas at 22,300. The settlement went steadily on until the Indian wars. The adversities which the people met for nearly three-fourths of a century seem t-j have been too much for human endurance. Their suffering were greatest in the wars commencing in 1792 and 1703. During the first of these there was fought on its soil one of the most remarkable battles of the Indian war. Five hundred French and Indians under French \u25a0officers attacked the garrison of Joseph Storer, \u2014 a place of refuge which he had built at his own expense for all who, driven from their homes, might come to him. There were within it 15 soldiers only under Cap- tain Converse; and about a mile distant, at the landing, wove two coasters under captains Gooch and Storer, having on board 14 addi- tional men for the garrison. Every means were tried bv the enemy against the fort and vessels, but all their machinations were ineffectual ; and after two days of uninterrupted conflict, they were compelled to abandon the enterprise, with the loss of Labocree, their commander. It was during this bloody war that Rev. George Burrows, who was then residing near Salem, became the victim of the terrible witchcraft delusion, aud perished on the scaffold. He was a graduate of Harvard college, and had been an esteemed minister in the vicinity of Wells, and was at the time of his arrest devoting himself to obtain aid for the suffering people of tti3 east, who like himself had been driven off by by the Indians, or were endeavoring heroically to hold their ground against them. In an attack in August, 1703, Wells was again attacked, and with such desperation that in a short time 39 of its inhabitants were killed or made prisoners, besides many wounded. This war did not end -until 1713, during which time many more of the inhabitants were murdered, many houses burned, farms laid waste and cattle killed. 'Ten years later another war let loose again the savage hordes ; but the \u25a0towns had grown stronger. In 1745 occurred the memorable and suc- cessful siege of Louisburg. Believing that the French had been the inciters of most of the Indian wars, the people of Maine entered upon that expedition with great earnestness; and it is believed that fully one-third of the able bodied men of Wells were engaged in that enter-"], [587, "WELLS. 579 prise. The people were right in the belief, and Wells was little troubled by the Indians after the fall of the eastern stronghold of the French. The people of Wells entered into the Revolutionary war with such zeal that at least one-third of the able-bodied men were in the service duriig a portion of the struggle, if not constantly. Colonel Joseph Storer, Major Daniel Littlefield, Captain James Hubbard, Captain Daniel Wheelwright, Captain Samuel Sawyer, died in the war. Gen eral Noah M. Littiefield, Major Nathaniel Cousens, Major Isaac Pope, Captain James Littlefield, Ensign John Littlefield, and others, were in active service. No other town had such a number of officers in the war. The bounties required to fill their quota exhausted their finances to such an extent that some were obliged to take the feathers from their beds, and procure their Bale in Boston, to meet their proportion of these public burdens. The feeling of the people was against the war of 1812, and few or none enlisted. In the war of the Rebellion the quota of the town was largely obtained from abroad, the bounties paid ranging from $200 to $400. Wells has honored the memory of the forty-two of her soldiers who perished in that war by a neat monument. It consists of a simple marble shaft on a granite base. After the Revolutionary war, there was a great increase of ship building, the vessels being mostly of less than 300 tons burthen. So manyr of them were captured by the French at the time of their spoli ations that it has been thought that the loss of the town in ships was as large as its gain by ship-building. The business of the people is chiefly agricultural. The so.il, though sandy in some parts, is excellent for vegetables, and yields a good crop of grass. On Ogunquit, Webhannet and Little rivers are many mill sites, if not great powers ; and each of these streams has its mill for lumber. A considerable number of the inhabitants are interested in the fisheries. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $683,940 ; in 1880 it was $613,326. The population in 1870 was 2,773 ; aud in 1880, 2,483. The rate of taxation for 1880 is one third of one^er centum. The principal business centres are Wells Village in the north-west, Ogunquit at the south, and Wells Depot in the northern part of the town, \u2014 each having a post-office. Wells Village is finely situated on a ridge overlooking the ocean. The Boston and Maine railroad passes near the latter place, and the Portsmouth, Saco and Portsmouth road has a station at Wells Depot, \u2014 each place being about 28 miles from Portland. Previous to the formal gathering of a church the town had provided the preaching. Rev. John Wheelwright was one of the first ministers. In 1661 the court at York appointed Ezekiel Knight and William Hammond to conduct worship at Wells on Lord's day, \"as the law of God and this jurisdiction require.\" This order continued about two years when the people again hired their own minister at a stipulated salarv. Six ministers or religious teachers were thus employed from 1664to 1690, \u2014 the first being Joseph Emerson, settled for two or three years His successor was a physician as well as minister ; and the next but one was Richard Martin, a schoolmaster. About this time a church and narsonage were built. For his services in the pulpit, Martin had the use of the parsonage, and 50 pounds, \u2014 payable as follows : wheat at"], [588, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 580 4s., rye 2s. 6d., pease 4s. per bushel, pork 2\u00a3d. per pound, boards 19s. and staves 17s. per thousand. From the time of the first Indian war until 1713, the period when Wells suffered most, it is probable that there was little or no preaching. The first Congregational church of Wells was organized in 1721, and Samuel Emery was ordained the pastor. The Rev. Moses Hemingway was ordained over this church in 1759, and remained until his death at the age of 76 years in 1811. He was a graduate of Harvard, and received from it the degree of D. D. Jonathan Greenleaf, author of Ecclesiastical Sketches of Maine, was ordained over the church in 1815, remaining until 1828. He died at Brooklyn, New York, in 1855, aged 80 years. The second Con gregational church of Wells was organized in 1831. The first pastor was Rev. Charles S. Adams. The first Baptist Church in Wells was organized in 1793, and arose from the labors of Nathaniel Lord, a licentiate. The Wells Christian church was organized in 1809, by Elder Elias Smith. The Christian church of Wells and York, at Ogunquit, was organized in 1830. The Free-will Baptist society was formed in 1843. The Methodists formed a class of ten members in 1851, with Shadock Littlefield as leader. A neat and tasty house of worship was erected by them at Missionary Ridge in 1870. The first Universalist Society was formed in 1861. At present the active societies consist of two Congregationalist, a Free Baptist, two Methodist and two Baptist. The Union House, at Plaisted Corner, was fitted up for worship in 1868. Wells has 14 schoolhouses, valued at $5,000, and sustains a high school. The amount actually expended for schools in the last school year, is $3,816. It has a library of about 400 volumes. Wells is a port of delivery in Kennebunk Customs District. Wesley lies in the interior of Washington county, 20 miles north by north-west of Machias. It is on the stage-route from the latter place to Calais. Of the settled townships, Northfield adjoins it on the south, and Crawford on the north-east.

On the south-western part of the town, a bay penetrates nearly to the centre, into the middle of which projects from the north a long promontory called Rich's Mountain. There are said to be Indian inscriptions on the rocks on the west side of this mountain. The business centre of the town is at the mills on a tide-power on the eastern side of this bay. The tide powers in this town are estim ated as capable, if improved, of driving sixty up-and-down saws the year round, \u2014 but little use has been made of them as yet.

The surface is beautifully diversified by swells of land rather than hills. The soil is generally loamy or clayey and is usually well cultivated. The excellent markets near give it great advantages for farming and gardening; and the farm buildings give evidence of thrift. The Presumpscot river passes through the midst of the town, and, turning, forms nearly half the boundary on the south-east. The other streams are Stroudwater River, which crosses the south-western part of the town, and Duck Pond Brook in the north-east. Saccarappa is the only considerable village. It was long celebrated for its lumber business, begun in 1829 by Benj. Ingersol and others. The other localities bearing special names are Cumberland Mills, near Saccarappa, Pride's Corner in the north-eastern, and Duck Pond in the northern part of the town. At the latter is a water-power occupied by the Portland Wooden-ware Company ; at Cumberland mills is the extensive paper factory of S. D. Warren and Co. The larger factories in Saccarappa are the Westl i : Manufacturing Company, producing cotton duck and shirtings ; ti.e Westbrook Foundry Company ; the Haskell Silk Company, producing sewing-machine twist, train and fringe silks, and the Presumpscot Mills Dye House.

Westbrook was formerly a part of old Falmouth, from which it was set off and incorporated as \" Stroudwater \" in 1814. The next year its name was changed to Westbrook, in honor of Colonel Thomas West brook, who distinguished himself in the Indian wars. Deering was set off from Westbrook in 1871. Westbrook was for many years the home of Rev. Prof. Henry B. Smith and Miss Annie Louise Cary. Paul Akers, the sculptor, was born in this town in 1825, dying in Phila delphia in 1861. Other persons of eminence still reside here. Saccarappa has a flourishing Methodist church, a Congregational church which dates its organization from 1832 ; a Universalist and a Catholic church.

The surface is uneven, and the northern ex tremity terminates in a narrow headland called Squaw Heights. The remains of an earth-work fortification are here to be seen by whoever is curious enough to climb the steep sides of the promontory. It was erected during the war of 1812, and bore the name Fort McDonough. At the time of the engagement between the Enterprise and Boxer, off the mouth of the river, this work was mounted by a star battery of six guns arranged to command the river with a plunging fire, and was protected by a chevaux de fi'ise, \u2014 a barrier of fallen timber trees bris tling with sharpened branches and pointed stakes, which ran across the island from shore to shore below the battery The soil of Westport is a clay loam. Fair crops of potatoes, bailey, oats and wheat are readily obtained. Westport has several excellent tide powers, which are improved for mills. There are three saw-mills which do more or less work, that of the Heal Brothers being the largest. But the principal occupation of the inhabitants is on the sea. The island is connected with Woolwich by abridge 1,350 feet long. A ferry connects it with Wiscasset at a point about three miles from the sta tion of the Knox and Lincoln railroad.

On the Messalonske, immediately after it passes the Waterville road, is a beautiful cascade. The stream, which is here about seventy feet wide, after passing a dam, pitches over a precipice ot jagged slate rocks, throwing the water into several beautiful forms and collecting it again as foam and spray in a deep, dark basin between nigii, rocky banks, overhung by birch, maple, cedar and hemlock. The tall is forty-four feet in eight rods.

There is also a small village in the southern part called King's Mills, which is the same as Whitefield post-office. The Plymouth proprietors claimed the territory of this town, but failed to establish their right. It was settled about 1770 by Irish Roman Catholics. At this time the town formed the western part of Ballstown, now Jefferson, to which it remained attached until 1809, when it was incorporated, being named in honor of the celebrated preacher, George Whitefield. At the close of the Revolutionary- war many of the veterans of the army settled in Whitefield.

Greenleaf Hill is the highest elevation. The south ern portion is fair farming land. The town is principally noted for its fair roofing slate. Only one quarry is worked at present. Its streams are the west branch of Pleasant River, Roaring Brook and Whet stone Brook. Each of these has good mill privileges, and upon the latter a saw-mill and shingle machine have been erected. Mr. William Dood of Boston early purchased this township from the State, and from his Christian name comes the name of the town. John Crommet settled in the part near Brownville as early as 1808, Moses Head in 1810, and Moses Greenleaf, Mr. Dood's agent, probably i.i the same time. Williamsburg has a noted pre-eminence in one re spect, for in it the first map of Maine was plotted, and the first book of the county written. The work was Greenleaf's \" Statistics of Maine,\" issued as early as 1816, intended to explain his map. This book he afterward enlarged and amended, issuing it in 1829 as the \" Survey of Maine.\" The first mentioned book bad 154 pages, the last, 468. He issued a new map, enlarged and improved, at the same time with the latter volume. Col. John F. Dunning and Captain Adams are especially remembered among the respected citizens of the town. The \" Piscataquis Central Slate Company's \" quarries employ more men then any other enterprise in town. The inhabitants of the township were organized in 1819 as Wil liamsburg Plantation, Eben. Greenleaf being chosen plantation clerk. In the following year it was incorporated as a town, being the second town incorporated by the first legislature of the new State of Maine. The town was divided in 1834, the western portion becoming the town of Barnard. A small Congregational church was organized here in 1830. The town sent 12 men as soldiers in the war for the Union, of which two were lost. Williamsburg has three public schoolhouses, valued at $250. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $29,909. In 1880 it was $28,275. The rate of taxation in 1880 was one cent, and three mi'ls. The population in 1870 was 176. In 1880 it was.444. TVilSOll is an extinct town, now a part of Shirley, on the south western border of Piscataquis County. Its history and description constitute a homogeneous part of that of Shirley, and may be found under that head. WilSOn'S Mills,\u2014 a post-office in Oxford County WiltOll it situated in the southern part of Franklin County, having Farmington on the east, Carthage on the west, Temple on the north, and Jay on the south. The town is about ten miles long from"], [599, "WILTON. 591 east to west, and seven wide. The principal sheet of water is Wilson's Pond, about 1-} square miles in area, situated midway of the northern part. In the northern part is North Pond, nearly as large as the last; and in the south-east is Pease Pond, of smaller size. The soil of the town is generally fertile, and the usual forest trees flourish. The busi ness centres of the town are Wilton and East Wilton. The last has a station of the Farmington branch of the Maine Central railroad ; the former has a station about one and one-half miles distant. The chief occupation of the inhabitants is farming ; and the well-cultivated appearance of the farms and the neatness and good repair of the buildings indicate thrift. At East Wilton the largest manufactories are the Moosehead Mills and the Holt scythe-factory. The manufactures are woolens, scythes, the lightning hay-cutter, moccasins, harnesses, tinware, packed i'i uits, etc. The chief manufaoturies at Wilton village are the Furnel woolen factories, a superior flour-mill, the Wilton Cheese Factory, and a tan nery. The manufactures are furniture, leather, boots, cloths (meltons, cassimeres and repellants), si ingles, boards, scythe-sharpeners, potash, flour and meal, cheese, canned corn (2 factories), etc. East Wilton is a beautiful village, the dwellings being scattered along a street at the base of a grassyr hill, upon whose top waves a considerable forest ; while below, on the other side of the road, flows quietly the spreading stream which carries the mills. Wilton Village, two or three miles distant, occupies the bottom and side of a picturesque valley, with a wild wood on the opposite hillside ; and between this and the principal street for a fourth of a mile rushes Wilson's Stream, which furnishes the power of both villages. This is the outlet of Wilson's Pond ; which occupies so elevated a position that the stream furnishes nine powers within the town. The pond according to the town plan, con tains an area of 190 acres ; while at one point it is over 175 feet in depth. This large body of water retains the heat to such a degree that there is no trouble with ice at the mills near the pond. In a com manding position stands the noble building of the Wilton Academy, of the few remaining of these valuable institutions. The township which is now Wilton was granted to Captain Tyng and company, of Concord, Mass., for an excursion against the Indian enemy, in which a dangerous savage called Harry was killed. In 1785 the township was explored by Solomon Adams and others, located by Samuel Titcomb, surveyor for the State, and lotted by Mr. Adams in 1787. The explorers called it Harrytown, in memory of the ill-fated Indian ; but the first settler called it Tyngtown,in honor of thegrantee. In 1790, Samuel Butterfield settled in Wilton and built a saw and grist mill at East Wilton. At the same period Isaac Brown became a res ident; and after these soon followed William Walker, Ammial dough, Joseph Webster, Silas Gould, Ebenezer Eaton, Josiah Perham, Ebe nezer Brown, Josiah Perley and Josiah Blake. Henry Butterfield, who, at sixteen years of age, cut the first tree within the limits of the town, as well as Captain Hammon Brown, the first male child born in town, were a few years since, still alive and resident in Wilton, \u2014 whose territory they had seen to change from a wilderness to cultivated farms and busy villages. At Wilton village are a church belonging to the Congregationalists, one to the Methodists, and one to the Universalists. At East Wilton"], [600, "592 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. are a Methodist, Free Baptist, Congregational Union, and Universalist church. Wilton has thirteen public schoolhouses, which, together with other school property, are valued at $15,000. The valuation of the town in 1870 was $595,260. In 1880 it was $638, 797. The popula tion in 1870 was 1,906. In 1880 it was 1,739. Willdliam, in Cumberland County, at its northern angle joins Raymond, forms for a short distance the eastern shore of Jordan Bay and Lake Sebago, and thence extends down the Presumpscot River to Westbrook. Jordan Bay, Standisll, and Gorham bound it on the west ; a part of Westbrook, with Falmouth lie on the south-east ; and Gray bounds it on the north-west. Little Sebago Lake, for about one-third its length, lies in the north-eastern part. Near this on tho south is Collins Pond ; and Little Pond lies about a mile distant on the north ; south-west of this about one mile distant, is the Basin of Lake Sebago. On the eastern line of the town, midway of its length, lies Duck Pond about two miles to the north. The streams are Outlet Brook, by which Little Sebago discharges into the Basin ; Ditch Brook, connecting Collins Pond with Pleasant River; Black Brook, Caller wright Brook in the southern portion of the town ; and Inkhorn Brook, at the southern angle of the town. Pleasant River, which passes through the middle of the town southward, is the largest stream except Presumpscot River, which forms the western boundary. Five powers on the Presumpscot River and two or more on Pleasant River, are improved by mills. At Great Falls are a saw-mill and a barrel factory ; at Gambo Falls are the numerous buildings of the Oriental Powder Company ; at Mallison Falls is a woolen-mill ; and at Pope ville, on Little River are a woolen and felt-mill. Other manufactures are, boots and shoes, lumber in its various forms, meal and flour, wood-paper board, carriages, harnesses, coffins, clothing, wooden-ware, etc. In 1814, an artificial outlet which had been made at the south end of Little Sebago Pond became so enlarged that great quantities of the water of the pond escaped, carrying away mills and bridges and doing much damage along Little and Presumpscot rivers. The grant of this township was made in 1734 to Abraham Howard, Joseph Blaney, and fifty-eight other citizens of Marblehead. The township consequently took the name of New Marblehead. In 1762 it was incorporated as Windham, the name being the same as that of a town in Norfolk County, England. Capt. Thomas Chute felled the first tree, and in 1737 built of logs the first house on the banks of the Presumpscot. A meeting-house was erected in 1740. The surface of the town is uneven, though there are no lofty hills. The soil is loamy and easily worked. In the southern part are inexhaustible quarries of granite. Perhaps it was this part of the town that Whitefield looked upon late in the autumn of 1744 or 1745, and exclaimed, \"Pray where do they bury their dead ?\" In 1744 a substantial fort was erected in the settlement, and fur nished at the expense of the inhabitants with two swivel guns and the necessary ammunition. From 1745 to 1751 the inhabitants lived within its walls. It was a period of great suffering and danger ; yet dur ing this time none of the inhabitants lost their lives by the Indians, though William Maxfield was wounded, and William and Joseph"], [601, "WINDSOR. 593 Knight, Wiliam Bolton and Seth Webb were taken and hold prisoners for a short time. After a respite of peace and prosperity for three years, Indian hostilities again commenced. Beside the defense of the fort, many dwelling-houses had now been prepared as garrisons. The last and most important attack upon Windham was made in May 14th, 1756, by about twenty savages led by Poland, the chief of the Rocko meko tribe. On the morning of that day, Ezra Brown and Ephraim Winship, accompanied by four men and four boys as a guard, left the fort for the purpose of working on Brown's lot. In passing through a wood, Brown and Winship being some distance in advance, were fired upon by ambushed Indians ; Brown being shot dead and Winship severely wounded, and both scalped. Four of the party in the rear hastened back to the fort, while the others, Abraham Anderson, Stephen Manchester, Timothy Cloudman, and Gershom Winship, con tinued on to avenge their companions or perish in the attempt. As they approached the spot, the Indians sprang behind the trees, the white men also dropped behind some logs, and the conflict began. As the result, Poland, the chief, and two of his followers, were killed by our four Spartan pioneers. After this, the people of Windham had! peace and prospered until the Revolutionary war. With the zeal which springs from a consciousness of being engaged! in a just cause, Windham took all necessary measures to prepare her .citizens at home or abroad. Officers were chosen to impart military instruction ; ammunition and accoutrements were provided ; and many of his townsmen served under Capt. Richard Mayberry through the campaign of 1777, till the surrender of Burgoyne in October of that year. No less than seventy-two men from Windham served in the Federal armies, and $2,280 in silver money were given by the town for the prosecution of the war. The first church was organized in 1743, when John Wight was ordained as pastor. The next pastor was Peter Thatcher Smith. Windham has produced quite a number of eminent persons. Among these may be mentioned John A. Andrews, distinguished as governor of Massachusetts ; and Mrs. Abby Goold Woolsonv favorably known as an author and lecturer. Her father, Hon. William Goold, still a resident, has rendered useful service to the historical interests of the State.. Windham has two Congregational ehu*ohes, one Free Baptist; one Universalist, one Methodist, one Friends, and one Union church.. The number of public schoolhouses is nineteen, valued at $7,800. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,014,877. In 1880 if was $819,839. The population at the same date was 2,428; The census of 1880 places it at 2,313. Windsor is one of the eastermost towns of Kennebec County. It is bounded by China on the north, Augusta on the west, Whitefield in Lincoln County on the south, and Somerville in the same-county on the east. The town is a square in its form. Its surface is hilly;: and from some of its elevations noble views are obtained. The principal. rock is granite; the soil is a clay loam, and the largest crop is hay. Three-mile Pond projects a considerable portion of its arc into the town at the north-west, Mud Pond lies at the middle of the westerm side, and Moody and Longfellow ponds, lie in the south-western part, Savade and Fox ponds at the north-east, and Donnell Pond a little 38"], [602, "594 GjiZETTEER OF MAINE. south of the centre of the town. The principal stream is the western branch of the Sheepscot, which passes through the eastern part of the town from north to south, affording power for a grist-mill, lumber, shingle, and carding-mills. Leather is the only other manufacture of note. At the period of its settlement, the town was remarkable for the quantity and quality of its pine, oak, hemlock, and other woods. The land is fertile and \"well-cultivated. The town is about 10 miles from the Kennebec, on the stage-line from Augusta to Belfast. The territory of the town belonged to the Plymouth Patent. The first settlement was commenced \"in 1790 by Walter Dockindoff, Thomas Labalister, Prince Keen, Samuel Pierce, John Linn, Dr. Stephen Bar ton, Benjamin and Joseph Hilton, Joseph Linscott, and Joseph Trask. The town incorporation was in 1809 under the name of Malta. It was changed to Gerry in 1820, and to the present one in 1822. Joseph Trask, Jr., born October 30th, 1790, was the first native citizen of Windsor. In the history of the town the murder of Paul Chadwick, a surveyor for the proprietors in 1809, by some squatters disguised as Indians, is an important incident. Several arrests were made ; and though an attack upon the jail was attempted by an armed band of disguised men, the offenders were brought to trial. The evidence, though conclusive as to the killing by some person in the company accused, did not show whose shot caused the death of the unfortunate man ; and as the public feeling was largely in favor of the accused, all were acquitted by the jury. The post-offices are Windsor, and West and South Windsor. The Methodists and Baptists each have a church in the town. AVindsor is said to have sent about two hundred soldiers into the war for the Union, and to have lost about on\u00ab hundred and twenty-five. The town has thirteen public schoolhouses, valued at $3,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $262,212 ; in 1880, $302,088. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 2^- per cent. In 1870, the population of Windsor was 1,266 ; but according to the census of 1880 it has fallen off to 1,079. Wlng'S Mills, a small village in the town of Levant, Penob scot County, the same as Levant Post-Office.

It is bounded on the north by Mattawamkeag, east by Webster Plantation, south by Lee and Lincoln, and west by Chester. The Penobscot River separates it from the last. The area is 22,040 acres. The rock is chiefly granite and slate. The Mattakeunk is the principal stream, entering the town at the south-east and discharging at the north into the Mattawamkeag, which has a part of its course along the northern line. Salmon Stream, in the western part of the town, is the next in size. Each of these have falls suitable for driving mills. The basins of the Mattakeunk and Salmon streams lie mostly in this town, and are still largely covered with forest. The manufac tories of Winn consist of two saw-mills for long and short lumber, one for short lumber, a large tannery, a carriage-factory, a boot and shoe shop, etc. The European and North American railroad passes along the river, having a station at Winn village, in the northern part of the town.

The manufactories of Winslow consist of a small woollen-mill, two grist-mills, two saw-mills, and a shoe-peg factory. The principal rock in town is slate. The soil of the parts bordering on the river is a sandy loam ; farther back, it is slaty and gravelly. The chief employment of the people is agricultural, and the principal crops are hay and potatoes. The usual forest trees are found in the woods, while on the public ways there are many elms and maples, some of which are very old. Reynold's Hill is said to be the highest elevation in town, affording fine views of the Kennebec and a wide expanse of landscape."], [604, "596 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. Winslow, which formerly embraced the territory of what are now Waterville and West Waterville, is the ancient Tacconnet (Ticonic). It was a part of the Plymouth Patent; and the original proprietors were mostly from Plymouth County, Massachusetts. Among the early settlers were persons bearing the Old Colony names of Howard, Wins low, Taylor, Bradford, Delano, Warren, Otis, White, etc. ; and de scendants of these are still found in the town. In 1754-5 a fortifica tion was erected by Governor Shirley, at the junction of the Sebasti cook with the Kennebec as an outpost, which was named Fort Hali fax. A single block-house of this fort is still standing a little to the north of the bridge over the Sebasticook, and may be seen from the cars, looking toward the Kennebec. The settlement was slow, the first being about the fort. The first farming attempted was upon the flat below Fort Hill, by Morris Fling, about the year 1764; which was for a long time afterward known as Fling's field. In 1676, the second year of King Philip's war in Maine, Abraham Shurte, the magistrate at Pemaquid, held a parley with the Indians near where Fort Halifax was built about 75 years later. He was received by the Indians in the \" great wigwam \" or fort ; but he was unsuccessful in his attempt to end the war. The town was incorporated in 1771, being named in honor of Gen eral John Winslow, who had command of the force employed in the erection of Fort Halifax. As a plantation, it had been called King field. At the first town meeting of Winslow, held April 3, 1771, Eze kiel Pattee was chosen clerk and treasurer; and Mr. Pattee, Timothy Heald and John Tozier, selectmen, and Solomon Parker, constable. Other minor officers were Robert Crosby, Nathaniel Carter, Francis Dudley, and Peter Crosby. Names of honored citizens of a later period are Hons. Joseph Eaton, Thomas Rice, Joshua Cushman, David Garland, and Lemuel Paine, Esq. In 1802, all that part of Winslow lying west of the Kennebec was set off and incorporated as the town of Waterville. The Congregationalists, Baptists, and Methodists each have a church in town. Winslow has fifteen public schoolhouses valued at $3,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $470,002. In 1880 it was $503,269. The rate of taxation in 1880 was 18 mills on the dollar. The population in 1870 was 1,437. In 1880 it was 1,467. Winter Harbor, a post-office in Hancock County ; also a historic locality at the mouth of the Saco River, so named by Richard Vines, in 1617, from his having spent the winter there. WlllterpOrt lies on the western bank of the Penobscot, constituting the north-eastern portion of Waldo County. Frankfort bounds it on the south, Monroe on the west, and Newburg and Hamp den in Penobscot County, on the north. Bucksport lies opposite, on the eastern side of the river. Winterport has a fine harbor, usually open in winter \u2014 whence the name of the town. The surface is some what broken, and has many swells, some of considerable altitude, es pecially a range lying in the midst of the town. The water-power is from Marsh River, which, for a considerable distance, forms the divid ing line betwixt Winterport and Frankfort. Cole's Brook, in North Winterport also furnishes some power. The manufactures consist of"], [605, "WINTHROP. 597 cooperage (two factories), sugar hogsheads and glass-casks, lumber, cheese and butter (Winterport Cheese and Butter Factory), men's vests (four factories), harnesses, etc. This was the pioneer town in the State in the manufacture of clothing. Agriculture furnishes the chief occupation of the inhabitants, and along the larger streams and in the interior there are some fine farms. The town is 20 miles north by north-east of Belfast, on the stage-line between that city and Bangor. Formerly what is now Winterport was noted for its ship-building and commerce. Its capacious wharves, large store-houses and deserted ship-yards bear evidence of the business which has now departed. The hard times of 1857, and the depreciation of shipping property which followed, brought financial ruin to owners and builders ; and only an occasional vessel has since been built here. Thirty or more years ago Theophilus Cushing ran a steam saw-mill here, the usual annual product of which was 11,000,000 feet of lumber, and 200,000 eugar-box shocks. The mill ran night and day, employing 100 men. At this period, also, large quantities of flour, grain and other commodities were discharged here from the vessels during the winter season, and hauled 13 miles to Bangor, \u2014 thus making emjiloyment for farmers' teams for many miles around.* Since 1870 there has been a large re duction of population, many mechanics having removed to the granite quarrying localities in and about Penobscot Bay and River, and others to the Great West. Winterport was set off from Frankfort and incorporated March 12, 1860. The religious societies are those of the Congregationalists and Methodists. The number of public schoolhouses is sixteen, which are valued, with their appurtenances, at $9,000. The population in 1870 was 2,744, and the number of polls, 624. In 1880 it was 2,260, with 523 polls. The valuation in 1870 was $600,300. In 1880 it was $558,099. WilltlirOp, a thrifty agricultural town, lies in the south western part of Kennebec County, 10 miles west by south-west from Augusta. It is bounded on the east by Manchester, and has West Gardiner at the south-east and Monmouth at the south, Wayne on the west and Readfield on the north. Winthrop has an area of 25,540 acres, a portion of which is water. The greater part of Cobbossee Contee Great Pond, of Annabessacook, Maranocook, Wilson's and several smaller ponds lie within the limits of the town. Maranocook Lake has now become a place of much resort in summer. It has a pretty steamer ; and on tho shores are convenient buildings for the regattas, musical and other entertainments held here. The lake is about 8 miles in length. The Maine Central Railroad, back route, has a station here.

The town has also long been noted for its fine apple-orchards. GRAMMAR SCHOOL HOUSE, WINTHROP, ME. At the village, situated between Annabessacook and Maranocook ponds, which divide the town, considerable manufacturing is done.

The other village is East Winthrop, situated in the north-eastern part of the town, near the northern extremity of Cobossee Contee Pond. The National Bank of Winthrop has a capital stock of $100,000. The ter ritory of Winthrop was a part of the Plymouth Patent. The first settler was Timothy Foster, who, in 1765, located his habitation by the great pond. A hunter named Scott was then occupying a hut on the same lot. The next settler was Squire Bishop, who came in 1767. The families of Foster, Fairbanks, Stanley, and Pullen, soon after set tled near. These being accustomed only to cultivated farms, suffered many hardships from their inexperience in subduing the wilderness, and must have perished, had it not been for the abundance of game and wild fruits. Three brothers, Nathaniel, William and Thomas Whittier, came in soon after ; and felling at once some twenty acres of timber, burned over the ground, and planted their corn without plough ing, obtaining a wonderful crop. The other settlers, profiting by observation of the Whittiers, as well as by their own experience, soon began to thrive. The first saw-mill was built by John Chandler, in 1768, and a grist-mill soon after, on the site now occitnied by the cotton factory. It is said that it required the whole strength of the settlement for nearly a week to get the mill-stones from the Kennebec to their place in the mill. For building these mills Mr. Chandler was granted by the proprietors of the township 400 acres of land. The first road was cut through to the \" Hook,\" now Hallowell. The first tax levied in town was in 1784 and the first payment was by Benjamin Fairbanks ; the money used being the sum received for bounty on the head of a wolf. As a plantation, Winthrop was called Pondtown. It was incor porated in 1771, being named for John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts. It included Readfield until 1791. Winthrop was first represented in the General Court in 1783, the representative in that year being Jonathan Whiting. A post-office was first established in town in 1800. The Winthrop Woollen Company was incorporated in 1809 and went into operation in 1814. Among those who received grants of land in the early years of the settlement, were Samuel and John Needham, Abraham Wyman, Nathaniel Stanley, Peter Hopkins, AmosBoynton, Jonathan Whiting, John and Joseph Chandler, Samuel and Amos Stevens, Joseph Baker and Elisha Smith. The first town officers were John Chandler, Timothy Foster, Robert Waugh, Jonathan Whiting, Stephen Pullen, and Gideon Lambert. The first ministers resident in Winthrop were Messrs. Thurston Whiting and Jeremiah Shaw. Rev. David Jewett was settled in 1782, and died the next year, when the town was divided into two parishes. Mr. Jonathan Belden was ordained in 1800, and was succeeded by Rev. David Thurston, in 1807. At present the Congregationalists, Methodists, Universalists, Baptists and Friends have each a society and church edifice in the town. Winthrop has ten public schoolhouses,"], [608, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 600 valued at $16,000. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,122,839. In 1880 it was $1,125,317. The population in 1870 was 2,229. By the census of 1880, it is placed at 2,146. WlSCtlSSCt is situated on the Sheepscot River, in the south eastern part of Lincoln county. Wiscasset Bay, an enlargement of Sheepscot River, occupies about one-third of the eastern side of the town, and is one of the best harbors on our eastern coast, being tho roughly protected, capacious, deep, and open even when Boston harbor is closed as far as the Castle. A United States Surveying Commission, in 1813, strongly recommended to the navy department the propriety of establishing a navy yard in Wiscasset. One hundred vessels of the largest size can anchor here at once in from 12 to 20 fathoms of water. A high bridge has been thrown across the river to Edgecomb, directly above the harbor, which has a draw of 34 feet, through which vessels of 1000 tons pass without difficulty. The surface of the town is of variable altitude, having many gorges, through which flow brooks, or inlets from the sea. The usual variety of forest trees are found in various parts of the town, some of them of old growth ; and old and young are often in naturally picturesque arrangement. The town is about 10 miles in length from north to south, its southern extremity resting on Monsweag Bay. It is bounded on the west by Woolwich and Dresden, on the north by Alna ; the island town of Westport, in the river, and beyond, Edgecomb, with the southern part of Newcastle, on the east. Cross River, the site of early settlement, crosses the midst of the town to the Sheepscot. On Monsweag Stream, which forms the dividing line between Wis casset and Woolwich, are eight water-powers, all of which have been in time past improved, but all, except one, have now been washed away or burned, or are in ruins. On a tidal cove, in the north-eastern part of the town, are the picturesque ruins of a mill and dam. Taylor's Point and Hill beyond are prominent objects. The view from the Hill is extensive and beautiful, embracing numerous hills, forests, dales, foaming streams and shining arms of the sea. The hill was formerly a station of the United States coast survey. South of the village is a picturesque cemetery, and below it a grassy glen succeeded by a lofty hill called Cushman 8 Mountain, that looks down upon the river and Monsweag Bay. Away to south-west of this hill is Jewonke Neck, full of varied, picturesque scenery, including both sea and shore. The drives either up or down the river, or over the Monsweag road to Woolwich are very pleasing. The village has several fine residences, \u2014 one in full view from the cars as they approach from the west being par ticularly striking and elegant. The village park, shaded by old elms and surrounded by the Congregational church, the court-house, and pleasant residences, is an attractive spot. The Episcopal church and the rectory adjoining, afford a contrast of old and new styles of architecture. The principal mills in operation are near the village on the south side. They are run by steam-power ; and vessels of large size load at the wharves beside them. Of these, the first, on Ilobson's Island, pro duces lumber and box shooks. In connection with it is a grist-mill. The second and more distant mill, is situated on Birch Point, and is"], [609, "WISCASSET. 601 devoted mainly to long and short lumber. The principal other man ufactures are sails and bricks. __. The first settlement of Wiscasset was made by George Davie, who is said to have lived about half a mile north of the point where the jail now stands. He purchased of the Indians a tract of several hundred acres, embracing within its limits the present village of Wis casset. During the summer of the year mentioned, he with his as sistants erected several buildings, and made improvements of various kinds, as well as encouraged the location of other settlers. On the breaking out of King Philip's war, in 1675, the people were obliged to flee from their homes ; and for nearly sixty years afterward the town was entirely depopulated. Robert Hooper came in with his family of four persons in 1730, and was thus the pioneer of the re-settlement. He erected his house by the side of a large rock on the eastern side of where Water street now runs. He had brought with him a small stock of cattle, and a number of fruit trees. In 1734, Michael Seavey, Robert Groves, Sheribiah Lambert, and a man by the name of Foye came in from Rye, N. H. Josiah Bradbury, Nathaniel Rundlett, Richard and Benjamin Holbrook, and Colonel Kingsbury arrived about the same time. A few years later, John Young and Messrs. Taylor, Boynton and Chapman settled on Cross River about two miles south of Wiscasset Point, the site of the village. Numbers increased yearly from this time, until in 1740 there was a plantation of 30 families, numbering 150 persons. On a hill south-west of the village was erected, in 1743, a fortifica tion, some relics of which are yet to be seen. It is related that in the latter part of September, 1744, a party of 20 Indians arrived before it, in a dense fog, for the purpose of an attack. The only persons in it at the time were two women and a girl, the men being at work in the fields at some distance. A little clearing away of the mist re vealed to the women their approaching enemies. They quickly barricaded the doors ; and disguising their voices, called to a number of imaginary persons to put the place in a state of defense. The In dians, believing that there was a large force within the fort, became alarmed and abandoned their design. In the summer of 1745, a man returning from the Seavey farm to the garrison, and while yet about 60 rods distant, from it was shot by an Indian concealed in the forest. Soon after this, two block-houses were built, one on what is now called Brimstone Hill, the other on Seavey's Hill. This settle ment was included, together with Alna, Dresden and Perkins, in the town of Pownalborough, and incorporated in 1760, the name being adopted in honor of Thomas Pownal, \u2014 at this date, governor of Mas sachusetts. It was incorporated under its present name in 1802. During the Revolution, the British sloop-of-war Rainbow came up the river, and, anchoring in the harbor, laid the town under contribu tion for supplies. The inhabitants were threatened with the halter and the town with destruction unless they complied with the requisi. tions ; and having no defenses, they were obliged to yield up their provisions. Immediately on the conclusion of peace, an extensive business grew up between Wiscasset and foreign parts ; and it was also the chief mart of trade for the home region. These were her palmy days. Most of her inhabitants were more or less interested in navigation,"], [610, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 602 and her ships were found on every sea. But the embargo of 1807 on shipping was laid at an unfortunate time, and dealt a destructive blow to her business and prosperity ; and the war of 1812 completed the mischief, so that the town has never to this day retrieved its fallen for tunes. Should the railroad projected to connect Wiscasset with (Quebec by way of Point Levi be built, the commodious harbor and land-locked waters of the Sheepscot must become an entrepot between England and the Canadas, by a shorter route than would be afforded by any other port. Judges Bailey, Orchard Cook and Hon. John D. McCrate, citizens of this town, have been representatives in Congress ; and Hon. Samuel E. Smith, another citizen, was for three years governor of Maine. Judge Lee, a citizen of the Revolutionary period, and Rev. Dr. Packard, a worthy Congregational minister of the same day, are the subjects of pleasing reminiscence. Wiscasset has, since the Revolution, been the seat of a custom house for the river and contiguous portions of the sea. The number of vessels now owned in the district is 161, having a tonnage of 9,894 tons. The products of fisheries in this district in 1879 was $366,445. The Knox and Lincoln railroad passes through the town, having a station at the village, 10 miles from Bath. As Pownalborough and Wiscasset, this has been the shire town of the county since 1794. The Episcopalians, Congregationalists and Methodists each have a church in the village. Wiscasset has seven public schoolhouses; and these, with other school property, are valued at $4,250. The village has a system of graded schools. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $689,554. In 1880 it was $319,773. The population in 1870 was 1,977. In 1880 it was 1,832. WOOdf Ord'S Comer,\u2014 a village and post-office in Deer ing, Cumberland County. WOOdlfind, in Aroostook County, is a new town situated in the third range from the border, and just north of the Aroostook River. It is bounded on the north by New Sweden, east by Caribou, south by Washburn and west by Perham Plantation. The water-courses are Caribou Stream, its West Branch, and the East Branch of Salmon Brook. The surface is rolling but without hills, the highest being about 50 feet and having the name of Bear Mountain. Maple, birch, beech, spruce, fir and cedar abound in the woods. The largest sheet of water ia Nelson Lake, having an area of about two acres. Limestone rock un derlies the whole town, as well as the country about ; but it is not often found sufficiently pure to make good lime. The soil is veiy fertile. The yield of wheat is usually about 40 bushels to the acre, and of potatoes about 400 bushels. Proportionate quantities of all crops are raised. Agriculture is the almost exclusive occupation of the people. The few frame houses in the town are in good repair, but the log houses have a decayed look. There is one shingle-mill capable of man ufacturing about 20,000 shingles per day. A stave-mill here has a capacity of 2,000 staves per day. The nearest railway station is in Caribou, six miles from the centre of Woodland. This town was incorporated March 5, 1880. It sent about a dozen"], [611, "WOODSTOCK. 603 men into the Union army during the war of the Rebellion, of whom two were lost. Woodland has five public schoolhouses, and the value of the school-property is estimated at $1,000. The population in 1870 was 174. In 1880 it was 679. The valuation in 1880 was $77,539. The rate of taxation was 7\u00a3 mills on the dollar. WoodstOCk lies at the centre of the broad, middle section of Oxford County. Bethel, and Milton and Franklin plantations bound it on the north, Sumner bounds it on the east, Paris and Greenwood bound it on the south and west. A group of not less than 14 high hills occupy the centre, of which are Mount Blue and Perham Moun tain. In the south-western part are Whitman and Curtis mountains, and in the south-eastern is Molly Ocket Mountain. The Lone Star Gold Mine is situated near the base of a mountain on the north eastern side of the middle group. Bryant's Pond is a fine sheet of water in the western part of the town, named for an early settler. From its southern extremity issues Little Androscoggin River. In the north-western corner is North Pond ; and in the north-eastern part lie Great Concord and Little Concord ponds, the latter two, the the sources of the East Branch of Concord River. South of these just within the border is Shagg Pond. The largest of these beautiful sheets is North Pond, and Bryant's Pond is next, being three miles long by one wide. All the eminences in the town seem to be composed in the main of granitic rocks. The soil is loamy and fertile, especially in the alluvial lands that skirts the p onds and streams. Potatoes is the chief cul tivated crop. The scenery of this town is varied and beautiful, and the roads are in general very good. Beech, birch, maple, poplar, spruce and fir deck the hill-sides and valleys inextensive tracts or scattered groups. The principal village is named Bryant's Pond, and is situated on the pond of that name and on the Grand Trunk railway, on which it is a station. The manufactories consist of four saw-mills, one sash and door factory, one grist-mill, and the others smaller and usually found in villages. The Lone Star Mine Co., operating for gold and silver at the point before mentioned, is a corporation of this town. Woodstock comprises two half townships, one of which was granted by Massachusetts, June 14, 1800, to Dummer Academy, and the other on February 7, 1807, to Gorham Academy. It was incorporated Feb. 7, 1815. Hamlin's Grant, a gore of 1,270 acres, granted to Cyrus Hamlin in 1816, was annexed to Woodstock in 1872. The first set tlement was made in 1798, by Christopher and Solomon Bryant, sons of Solomon Bryant of Paris. Settlements were begun in other parts of the town soon after. Lemuel Perham, an early settler, was the grandfather of ex-Governor Perham, who was born in this town, and in his youth cultivated one of these hill-side farms. The religious societies in the town are the Methodist, Baptist and Universalist. Of the first there are three ; of the second two. There are four church edifices. The public schoohouses of Woodstock num bor eleven, and are valued at $2,000. The population in 1 870 was 995. In 1880 it was 952. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $204,907. In 1880 it was $196,035. The rate of taxation in the latter year was 36 mills on the dollar."], [612, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 604 WOOdville,\u2014 a post-office in Penobscot County. WOOdville Plantation, in Penobscot County, lies at the south-western angle of Aroostook County, on the west bank of Penobscot River. It is bounded on the north by Medway, east by Mattawamkeag and south by Chester. The principal streams in the town are Pattagumpus, emptying into the Penobscot at the northern part of the township, and the East Branch of the Ebhops Stream in the south. The county road from Lincoln Centre to Medway passes through the midst of the town, and the principal settlements are on this road. This was formerly Indian township No. 2, but was organized as a plantation under its present name in 1854. It has two public school houses, valued at $150. The valuation in 1870 was $30,196. In 1880 it was $31,937. The population in 1870 was 293. In 1880 it was 223. WOOlwich is situated in the eastern part of Sagadahoc County, adjoining Lincoln County, whose towns of Westport and Wiscasset bound it on the east, and Dresden on the north. It is separated from Bath by the Kennebec River, from Arrowsie and Georgetown by Back River and Monsweag Bay, and by Monsweag River from Wiscasset on the east. The extreme length of the town from north to south is about 8\u00a3 miles, and the width from east to west is near 5^ miles. The area is 20,000 acres. The surface is much broken by low hills and projecting ledges, but has no great extent of low or marshy land. The soil is well adapted to the growth of every kind of produce for which the state is noted. Originally there was a heavy growth of timber in the town. The trees common to the region flourish, especially the oak. Nequosset Pond, situated a little south of the centre of the town, is a beautiful sheet of water. Its length is about two nyles, and its width varies from half to three-fourths of a mile. Its principal feeder, coming down from Dresden at the north, is marked by a line of low hills ; as is also its outlet, which runs southward, discharging into Back River. A considerable bay makes up into the southern part of Woolwich at each side. At the extremity of the point between is Hockomock Head, a high bluff with precipitous walls of rock, \u2014 which has a legend. During the Indian wars some Indians who had been committing depredations in Wiscasset were \"pursued, and one \u2014 said to have been a chief\u2014 was closely followed up this narrow bluff to its precipitous front. Discharging his gun, he flung it from him, cried \"Hockomock! Hockomock!\" and leaped down into the water. Thus runs the legend. In confirmation of it, |,here was found a few years since in a crevice of the rocks near the top, a gun, silver mounted, and evidently of French workmanship, but SO decayed as almost to fall in pieces at the touch. Eastward of Hockomock is Phips' Neck, forming the south-eastern portion of the town. Near the point abridge connects with Westport across a narrow part of the bay. Woolwich has four small villages, \u2014 one, Montsweag post-office on the falls of the stream bearing that name ; Nequosset railroad station on the outlet of Nequosset Pond; Woolwich at the lower ferry, post office and railroad station, and Woolwich village at the upper ferry,"], [613, "YARMOUTH. 605 opposite the upper end of the city proper of Bath. The manufactures are at Nequosset and Montsweag, and consist of lumber, bricks an I leather. There is also a grist-mill on a branch of the Montsweag in the north-eastern part of the town. The early name of Woolwich was Nequosset, from the Indian name of the pond. John Bateman and Edward Brown were the first settlers. They became resident in 1638, and the next year purchased from Robin Hood, an Indian chief, most of the territory now comprised by Woolwich. Messrs. Smith, Cole, Phips and White came in very soon after. Subsequently a portion of this tract was claimed by Thomas Clark and Sir Biby Lake, and by settlers under them, by whom mills were erected about 1658. The settlement of Bateman and Brown was made under the grant to John Mason of 10,000 acres of land on the east side of the Sagadahoc. The peninsula at the south-east part of the town (Phips' Neck) was owned and occupied by James Phips (or Phippes), where was born in 1651, the son, afterward dis tinguished as Sir William Phips, and who in 1692, was made royal governor of Massachusetts and Maine. Direct tradition points out the place on this neck where young Phips built the vessel which in 1776, conveyed the settlers of the region out of the reach of the murderous savages. The fort of the Indian trader, Hammond, destroyed by the Indians in August, 1676, is said to have been in this town. The Rev. Josiah Winship, a graduate of Harvard, was the first minister settled in woolwich. He was ordained here in 1765, when there were only about twenty families and two framed houses in the town. He was the first Congregational paster ordained over a church in Kennebec valley. There is a still a flourishing church of this deno mination here: and its pastor is Rev. Henry O. Thayer, the historian of the region. The Baptists, Free Baptists and Methodists also have each a church in the town. Woolwich has seven public schoolhouses, and the total school property has a value of $3,400. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $597,650. In 1880 it was $532,639. The popu lation in 1870 was 1,168.

Yarmouth is a seaport town on Casco Bay, and is situated near the middle of the sea-coast line of Cumberland County. The stations of the Grand Trunk and Maine Central railroads, near the middle of the town, are about 11 miles from Portland. The two roads form a junction about half a mile from the village. In the area of land, this is the smallest town in the county, except, possibly, Deering. It is nearly square in form, and is divided through the midst by Royal's River. Cousin's River separates it from Freeport on the north-east, and the latter with Pownal bound it on the east, North Yarmouth on the north, Cumberland on the west and Casco Bay on the south. In cluded in the corporation are also Cousin's Island, Lane's Island, Great and Little Moges, Little John's and Crab islands. The first island is the largest, having a fish-oil factory, a schoolhouse, and fifteen or twen ty families. Little John's Island has four dwellings, and Great Moges, one. The surface of the town is not greatly variable in its elevation."], [614, "606 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. The woods are chiefly of the evergreen sort ; yet there arc many elms along the public ways, of an age from one to a hundred years. The soil, in general, is clayey. The principal crops are grass and sweet corn. The manufactories of the town are chiefly on Royal's River, near the village. They consist of a factory making cotton warp and seamless bags, a grain-mill, the wood pulp factory of the Forest Paper Co. ; a machine-shop and foundry ; factories for corn-canning, for earth en-ware, stove polish, blocks and cigar boxes, wood-filling, lumber, coffins and caskets, medicine, and boots and shoes, etc. Usually there are also one or more vessels built each season. Yarmouth constituted the eastern part of North Yarmouth until 1849, when it was set off and incorporated as an independent town. Though losing the ancient name, Yarmouth comprises the localities of the earliest settlement and history. When some settlers arrived at the place in 1640, they found a fort already built, which had for some time been occupied by George Felt, who had purchased it of John Phillips, a Welshman. In 1646, William Royall, purchased a farm on the river which has since borne his name. This stream and its vicinity was called by the Indians, Wescustego. They had a burying-place on Lane's Island, a short distance from the mouth of the river; and dur ing the Indian wars they sometimes held carousals at that place. John Cousins had arrived a year or more earlier than Royall, occupying the neck of land between the branches of the stream which has <ince been called Cousin's River, and owning the island now bearing his name. Richard Bray, James Lane, John Maine, John Holman, Messrs. Shep ard, Gendall, Seward, Thomas Blashfield, Benj. Larrabee, Amos Stev ens, Thomas Reading, and William Haines, were also early settlers. The first set of trustees for the corporation was appointed in 1681, They were Bartholomew Gedney, Joshua Scottow, Sylvanus Davis and Walter Gendall. The last bore the title of captain, and previous to the second Indian war had become well and favorably known to the Indians as a trader. In 1688, while the inhabitants on the eastern side of the river were building a garrison, they were attacked by the Indians, and Benedic Pulsifer, Benj. Larrabee and others attempted a defence. Capt. Gendall, at the garrison on the west side of the river, observed the contest, and set off in a float to carry ammunition to his neighbors, who had ceased firing. The Indians fired upon and wounded both Gendall and the man who was paddling the float before they could reach the shore. Gendall succeeded, however, in getting the ammuni tion to his friends, who continued the contest until night; when the eavagcr. retired. It was not long before they appeared again, in such force that the thirtv-six families which constituted the settlement were forced to fly from the place, abandoning their homes and stock to the fury of the Indians. It was not until about 1713 that settlers ventured to revisit their homes, when they found their fields and the sites of their habitations covered by a young growth of trees. Among the new proprietors at the time of re-settlement, were Gilbert and Barnabas Winslow, Jacob Mitchell, Seabury Southworth, Cornelius Soule, who were descendants of the Plymouth pilgrims. Until after the year 1756 the Indians were again very troublesome. In 1725 William and Matthew Scales and Joseph Felt were killed, and the wife and children of the latter car ried into captivity. A grandson of Felt, Joseph Weare, became a"], [615, "YORK. 607 noted scout, pursuing the savages with unrelenting hate at every op portunity. In August, 1746, a party of thirty-two Indians secreted themselves near the lower falls for the purpose of surprising Weare's garrison, killing Philip Greely, who came in their way. This was the last attack of savages which occurred within the limits of the town. From this time until the Revolution, the people of Royall's River had peace ; but in that momentous Struggle the inhabitants of what is now Yarmouth were not surpassed in their devotion to the American cause. On the 20th of May, previous to the Declaration of Indepen dence, they \" voted unanimously to engage with their lives and for tunes to support Congress in the measure.\" Many distinguished people have resided in the town. One of the earliest was the Rev. Animi R. Cutter, who was settled as pastor in 1730, but subsequently studied medicine. He led a company to the siege of Louisburg in 1745, remaining there as surgeon of the garrison after the surrender. The town has two Congregational churches, and one each belonging to the Baptist, Universalist and Roman Catholic denominations. The North Yarmouth Academy is situated in Yar mouth village, and notwithstanding a good town high-school, it still flourishes. Yarmouth has ten public schoolhouses, and the school property belonging to the town is valued at $3,500. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $1,034,336. In 1880 it was $1,022,670. The rate of taxation in 1880 was lj per cent. The population in 1870 was 1,872. In the census of 1880, the figures are 2,021. York, in the county of the same name, is a sea-coast town, and the southernmost but one in the State. Within its limits was established the first English city in America. In 1641 a tract near the mouth of York River, three miles square, was incorporated by Sir Ferdinando Gorges, proprietor of the province, as the town of Agamenticus. In 1642, Gorges, desirous of a suitable capital for his Province of Maine, replaced the town corporation by a chartered city, upon which he be stowed the name of Georgeana. Its limits were seven miles inland from the sea by three in breadth ; and the Agamenticus (York) River formed its south-western boundary. The date of the first settlement of York is not known. Edward Godfrey, once governor of the pro vince, affirmed that he was an inhabitant in 1621/ and 1630, and \"the first that built there.\" In 1643 Gorgeana is believed to have had between 250 and 300 inhabitants. Captain William Gorges, nephew of the proprietor, had been appointed by him governor of the province, having come over with his commission in 1635. He appears to have visited England about tho time of the breaking out of the war between the Puritans and King Charles I., preceding the establishment of the commonwealth and the protectorate of Cromwell. The death of the proprietor of the province, Sir Ferdinando, occurring in 1647, and nothing being heard from Governor William Gorges, the inhabitants of Kittery, Gorgeana, Wells, and probably the Isle of Shoals, met in con vention at Gorgeana, and formed themselves into a confederacy for mutual protection and just administration of the government, and Ed ward Godfrey was chosen governor. In 1652, when Massachusetts ex tended her jurisdiction over the province under a new interpretation of the boundaries of her charter, the name of the city was changed to York, and that of the province to Yorkshire, to avoid the city charter"], [616, "608 GAZETTEER OF MAINE. and Gorges' right. The province was taken from the control of Mass achusetts by the commissioners sent by Charles II., in 1664, and placed under the protection of the king; but in 1668, by the desire of a large portion of the inhabitants, it was again placed under Massachusetts. In 1674, the king ordered Massachusetts to relinquish her control in Maine, and restored the province to the heirs of Gorges. Upon this, Massachusetts, in 1677, purchased the whole province of Maine of its proprietors ; and in 1716, York was made the shire town of the county of Yorkshire, which was now extended over the Sagadahoc region. In each of the three first Indian wars, great efforts were made by the savages to destroy the place, but without success. The most dis astrous of their attacks was in February, 1692, when an unexpected assault was made early in the morning by two or three hundred Indians under the command of Frenchmen. In half an hour, more than 150 of the inhabitants were either killed or captured. After burning all the undefended houses on the north side of the river, the Indians retired quickly into the wilderness with about 100 prisoners, and all the booty they could carry. The effect of this affair was to make relentless Indian fighters o: many of the children who returned from captivity, who remembered the cruelties and indignities inflicted GARRISON-HOUSE AT YORK, BUILT ABOUT 1645. noon their parents. Two garrison houses, Mclntire's and Junkin's, built in this period were standing in the town, at a recent date. Many men from York joined the Louisburg expedition in 1745, among whom was Rev. Samuel Moody, who was a chaplain. The first soldiers to enter the continental army from Maine are said to have been from York. One Benjamin Simpson from this town, nineteen years of age, apprentice to a bricklayer in Boston, helped destroy the tea in the harbor. Among the military men of the ii wn was Johnson Moulton, who reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel. The news of the battle of Lexington reached York at evening. Xtoa inhabitants"], [617, "YORK. 609 met on the following morning and enlisted a company of about sixty men, furnished them with arms, ammunition, and knapsacks full of provisions ; and they marched 15 miles on the road to Boston and crossed the ferry into Portsmouth before the day closed. The war of 1812 was not popular on the sea-coast, but the town met all the require ments of the government. In the war of the Rebellion, money was freely paid out, and every quota promptly filled. When the province of Slaine was purchased by Massachusetts, all unconveyed land and all rents of course reverted to Massachusetts. To settle the titles in York, Thomas Damforth, in behalf of the gov ernor and council of the Commonwealth, in l684, deeded to certain citizens of the town as trustees in its behalf, all land granted to it by the former proprietor, thus giving the town the right to dispose of the unconveyed lands as it saw fit. The consideration was that each fam ily should pay two or three shillings annually to Massachusetts. Thus the town acquired its present boundaries, which are the sea on the east, Wells on the north, South Berwick on the west, and Eliot and Kittery on the south. The number of acres of land in the town is stated at 20,128. The bodies of water are Chase's and Folly ponds. Tho first, which is largest, is 3 miles long and \u00a3 a mile wide, or 350 acres in area. The chief streams are York River, Chase's Stream and Josius River. On Chase's Stream at Cape Neddick is a factory pro ducing woolen cloth and yarn. On a power lower down, having a fall of thirty-five feet, is a saw and grist-mill. There are other small powers in town which are used a portion of the time. At the Corner is an extensive brick-yard, and several other small manufactories. At each, Cape Neddick and York Village, are good harbors for the largest coasting vessels. The Knubble light-house, at Cape Neddick, has a fixed red light on a conical iron tower. The tower is painted red, the lantern black. The keeper's dwelling, a one and a half story house, painted white, stands fifty feet north of the tower. The town consti tutes a customs district. The principal occupations of the inhabitants are sea-faring and farming. One or more vessels are built in most seasons. There was formerly much oak and pine timber in the town ; but the larger trees are now rare. The face of the country along the sea-shore is quite broken or rocky. In the north-west part of the town is Agamenticus Mountain, 680 feet in height, overlooking Chase's Pond at its verge. The United States Coast Survey erected an observatory upon its summit, from which an extended view of the country is obtained. There are two notable headlands, Bald Head Cliff and Cape Neddock. During storms, the sea beats grandly upon the massive blocks of stone that form the high precipitous shore. The beach is one of the best on the coast. Off the Nubble is a noted ducking ground. York has several hotels, of which a number are intended mainly for summer visitors. Its nearest railroad connections are Wells, South Berwick, Eliot and Kittery stations, the last being the nearest and connected by a daily stage-line. The soil along York River is clayey and fertile, but gravelly in the interior. The proximity of the sea-shore fertilizers is quite an advant age to the farms. The apple-tree flourishes well and bears bountifully. Large quantities of blueberries are picked. U..., potatoes and hay are the principal crops. 39"], [618, "GAZETTEER OF MAINE. 610 One of the earliest of the distinguished men of York was Colonel Jeremiah Moulton, who served in the French and Indian wars, and commanded a regiment at the siege of Louisburg. He was afterward successively sheriff, councillor, judge of common pleas and of probate. David Sewell, a native of the town, and a graduate of Harvard College, was judge of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, and at his death, in 1818, was District Judge of the United States for Maine, having been a judge forty-one years. William P. Preble, another native, was LTnited States Attorney for Maine, judge of the Superior Court, and minister plenipotentiary to the Hague under President Jackson. The first Congregational church of York is said to have been or ganized as early as 1672, by Rev. Shubael Dummer, whose ministry in the place began in 1662. A second Congregational parish was incor porated in the north-western part of the town in 1730, which had been recently settled by Scotch emigrants. In 1732 a church was organized, and the Rev. Joseph Moody was settled as its pastor. The town has now tworCongregational churches, two Methodists, one Calvinist Bap tist, and two Christian chapels. The number of schoolhouses in town is fourteen, and the value of the school property is estimated at $5,000 The valuation of the town in 1870 was $771,776. In 1880 it was $710,798. The rate of taxationis 13J mills on the dollar. The pop ulation at the same date was 2,654. In 1880 it was 2,463. York COUllty9 forming the south-western portion of the State, grew into its present name and form by degrees, and during a long period. Its beginning may be considered to have been the estab lishment of the government of the Province of Maine in 1640, by the proprietor, Sir Ferdinando Gorges. The limits of this province ex tended from the Piscataqua River to tl e Kennebec. The province soon came to be considered as two districts first spoken of as the East and West districts, or counties, of which the Kennebunk River was re garded as the dividing line. The town of York being the shire town of the western section, that portion gradually came to be called York district, or county, the other being called Somerset, or New Somerset. The Kennebunk Kiver also proved to be the western boundary of the temporary Province of Lygonia. In 1652, Maine cajnc under the con trol of Massachusetts, and the Isles of Shoals and all the territory northward of Piscataqua River to the White Mountain;, and thence eastward to Penobscot Bay, were included in the re-named and ex tended jurisdiction oi! Yorkshire. All this was overturned by the King's commissioners in 1664, who revived the divisions as established by Gorges, and formed the territory east of the Kennebec into the county of Cornwall. In 1677, however, Massachusetts purchased the Province of Maine of Gorges' heirs ; and again Yorkshire was ex tended eastward as far as the Kennebec. In 1716, the General Court ordered the extension of Yorkshire, so as to include all the settlements eastward ; and accordingly Penobscot Bay became again the eastern boundary. In 1735, courts were ordered to be held at York and Fal mouth, and the county received its present name. The establishment in 1760 of the new county of Cumberland, gave York County its pres ent boundary on that side. In 1805, Oxford County was formed, when York County first assumed its present limits. The Saco River passes through the eastern section, then forms its"], [619, "YORK COUNTY. 611 boundary line for some fifteen miles on the north-east. The Ossipee River continues this line ten miles or more further to the New Hamp shire line. The Salmon Falls River forms the western boundary line for about thirty miles, aud the Piscataqua continues it some ten miles further to the sea. The other considerable rivers are the Little Ossipee, Mousam, Kennebunk, Great Works, Little and York. In the northern part there are numerous ponds; Little Ossipee \u2014 somewhat north of the centre of the county \u2014 being the largest, except Great East Pond, which is partly in New Hampshire. In the northern part the hills are numerous, several of which are near 1,000 feet in height. Agamenticus Mountain, 600 feet high, is the greatest elevation near the coast. The rocks of the region are chiefly granitic ; though at some points near the coast they are argillaceous. The soil of the southern and eastern parts of the county inclines to sandy loam, though clay, and clayey and gravelly loam are frequent. The latter increases to the north, where the soil becomes strong and productive, though often difficult to work on account of the stones. The Portland and Rochester railroad crosses the middle of the county from north-east to south-west, while the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth, and the Boston and Maine railroads follow a similar direction near the coast. The county contains twenty four towns and two cities; and three United States Customs districts, Saco, Kennebunk and York, are within its limits. It has twenty-six towns and two cities. The shire town is Alfred. The valuation in 1870 was $22,442,875. In 1880 it was $22,423,960. The population in 1870 was 60,174; and in 1880, 62,299."], [620, ""], [621, ""], [622, ""], [623, ""], [624, ""]]
