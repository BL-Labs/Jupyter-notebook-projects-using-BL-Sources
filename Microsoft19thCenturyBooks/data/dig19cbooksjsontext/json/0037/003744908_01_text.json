Dear , According to the promise I made to you when you ran against me that foggy November night, I began my notes at once \u2014 even at that well known place, Charing Cross Station \u2014 and at the popular departure hour, about 8 p.m. The noise and bustle did not distract an old traveller like me. Being as usual in good time, I looked about me with interest and amusement, speculating as to the motives which set so many people moving and in one direction, \u2014 most of them probably going for pleasure \u2014 many in search of health \u2014 some for serious business \u2014 some running from creditors \u2014 others flying to meet friends. One man I knew and spoke to, and his motive for flight as confessed by himself was original and diverting to me, though B"], [14, "FLYING SOUTH. 2 apparently serious to him. He was a hitherto brief- less barrister with a sufficient income, who had enjoyed the luxury of quiet and commodious chambers in one of the Inns of Court till, to the destruction of his peace of mind, a brief had been left for him the day before, which scared him so much that he locked up his rooms, confided the brief and his key to the porter, decamped without leaving any address, and was about to put the Channel between himself and unwelcome business. His confession was cut short by the screaming of the engine, cries of ' Any more going ? ' ' Take your seats,' &c, and after obeying the last admonition we soon glided away. The arrangements are now so good, that to arrive in Paris is easier than it was IOO years ago to reach a suburb from London, but while en route T could not help reflecting upon the bewildering nature of the scene we had quitted to any one entirely unused to it ; and I imagined some worthy, not very remote ancestor, whose useful but narrow course of existence had proscribed rapid travelling, standing at the station aghast and dazed, and fancying himself in another planet. He would have found it almost impossible to take in what was going on around him. If told by some bystander that he could, in less than 28 hours, be transported from London to Marseilles, that state-"], [15, "BEWILDERED ANCESTOR. 3 ment and his surroundings would make him think the world gone mad. His ideas of the foreign travelling done by his countrymen would probably previously have been, that the aristocracy made the ' grand tour ' once, and then settled down for the rest of their lives ; and that one or two of his personal acquaintance were believed to have been as far as Paris \u2014 the journey thither occupying four or five days. His thoughts on the subject would be widened by hearing of ' through tickets ' taken for many of the principal towns of Europe. If he per severed, and left Paris by the ' rapide ' for the great southern French seaport, he would find on taking his seat that three-fourths of the travellers by the train were English like himself \u2014 lords, ladies, plain citizens, commercial men, ladies'-maids, children, nursemaids (some with babies in their arms), couriers, valets, and a sprinkling of small dogs. He would hear his mother tongue vociferated on all sides, and addressed to the French officials by many who were unable or unwilling to venture on a single word in a foreign language, mixed, however, with occasional outcries of more daring spirits, attempt ing the language of the country, with ' Conductor, voulez-vous me parler ou voulez-vous pas ?

He would learn that some of his neighbours were on their road to India or Africa, and most of them going to places hitherto held by him to be ' remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow ; ' and would be told that nothing would be easier for him than to go anywhere on the face of the earth, and that if he chose to be 'personally conducted' by Mr. Cook or Mr. Gaze, he could travel all the world over with those illustrious contractors, without any trouble to himself, so cheaply as to astonish him, and so quickly, that when in a town he would hardly know whether it was Yokohama or Reykjavik. He would find that Matthews's old story of a man startling a coach office clerk by demanding an inside place for ' Timbuctoo,' and justifying the demand by the announcement at the door of ' Coaches to all parts of the world,' was no longer a joke, and that such an application nowadays might be received with gravity, and possibly meet with success. ' La-bas\u2014 la-bas,' the refrain of one of Beranger's most admired lyrics, conveying in an apparently light, but really subtle way, a deep moral, points to the restless love of change and desire for fresh scenes which seem inherent in human nature \u2014 pre-eminently in British human nature. One form of the wish to be elsewhere"], [17, "BRITISH HYBERNALS. 5 than where we are, is very strongly shown in the annually increasing autumnal rush to a southern climate. As soon as the swallows take flight from their northern temporary habitations, all the vale tudinarians and idlers who are rich enough for the indulgence, prepare to fly also, and Egypt, Algiers, the whole length of the Riviera, and other less renowned and frequented warm winter nooks resound with the Anglo-Saxon tongue. Our American cousins are also very numerous, but they do not yet outnumber us islanders, and, in some ways at all events, *seem to make themselves less prominent ; for to whatever place the Englishman betakes himself, he carries with him his Church, his horse-racing, his cricket and lawn tennis ; and whenever and wherever one meets him, there is no mistaking his insular independence, and his re markable disregard for the habits and feelings of the natives of the countries he visits. It is more and more impressed upon me that the British are a nation apart from all others. ' Vous netes pas de la famille Europeenne,' said a Frenchman to me. Nor even when permanently resident in a foreign country does he often seem to lose his pecu liarity and his distinctness from all other nations. It is a strong case of ' c\u0153lum non animum.' This want of sympathy with his neighbours is the more"], [18, "6 FLYING SOUTH. to be regretted, inasmuch as home ties and attach ment to the land of his birth must be gradually weakened in the man who at the slightest hint from his doctor, or on the first feeling of personal discomfort, breaks up his camp, and abandons early associations and domestic and social duties, to bask idly in the sunshine, and make the care of his health the paramount consideration. Surely this facile detachment on the part of such large numbers must affect our character as a people. Arrived at Marseilles the question is, 'Whither next ? ' ' The world is all before us where to choose,' \u2014 at least the west, south, and east quarters of it ; for a while the north has been repudiated and fled from. Discussing this important point, a fellow-traveller, a middle-aged English lady, states that she has visited all, and more than all the well known winter health resorts, and in answer to inquiry on the subject, calmly asserts that the two she prefers are Algiers and San Francisco \u2014 places wide enough apart, one would say, and the latter, to the ordinary wayfarer, and to the ancestor be fore mentioned, absolutely unknown. The said travelled lady added that she had for many years lived about everywhere except in England, which country she thought she might visit again, but must first ' read it up.' A French lady present,"], [19, "MIGRATION RECOMMENDED. 7 the only representative of her nation, but braving this fact by saying, 'Moi, je ne crains pas les Anglais,' expressed the highest approval of the English quitting their foggy island in the winter : she had spent, she said, three months in and near London, was very well received, and had on the whole fair weather, for she was there in June, July, and August ; but she encountered, she declared, one foggy day so horrible that she passed it in tears, and all the Sundays were painfully difficult to get through ; therefore she concluded that in the short and gloomy days of winter a general exodus of the inhabitants was highly to be commended. On its being remarked to her that some people had business and desires which could not be aban doned, she exclaimed, ' Mais enfin, on fait ce que l'on veut' Murray, Badeker, Bradshaw, and other guide books may be all consulted ; they are indeed ex cellent in their way, but have all one unavoidable defect \u2014 namely, that whilst the volume is being printed and stitched together, the place described is hourly changing.

The pretty settlement of Costebelle, about a mile and a half from the town of Hyeres, on a hill in the pine-woods, consisting eight years ago of a few sparsely scattered villas inhabited only by the French, now boasts of one large and comfortable hotel and pension, inhabited only by the English ; another, half a mile nearer the sea, and another soon to come, they say ; Cannes, which forty years ago was an obscure fishing village, is now a large town, with the majority of its villas owned or inhabited by resident English, who are numerous enough to have three churches for their accommodation. Nice, with its more cosmopolitan character ; Monaco, and its neighbour Monte Carlo, made attractive by its gambling-tables and perfect musical performances ; Mentone, and across the Italian frontier, Bordighera and San Remo, are all swelling yearly into larger and larger places, and ex hibiting more and more of the British element. Cross to Algiers, or steam eastward to Egypt, it is ever the same story. However much one naturally respects the British character, one does not come abroad to study it, but rather the inhabitants of the country visited ; and they are increasingly diffi cult to be got at, as they find themselves swamped by the English visitors, who raise prices, alter"], [21, "RAIL WA Y LSOLA TION. 9 habits, and stalk triumphantly in the highways with the air of ' Who's afraid ? ' only associating with each other, and playing lawn tennis all day in pre ference to making themselves acquainted with the scenery and objects of interest which the country presents. Even at Algiers, this indifference to what is entirely new and remarkable prevails to a wonderful extent, although the habits, dresses, and manners of the Moslems, as far as they can be seen, ought surely to excite the curiosity and interest of those English who land in that corner of Africa, but who nevertheless content themselves with promenading up and down the modern French quarter. Thus, as of old, a man may go from Dan to Beersheba and find all barren. No doubt the railways have done much to effect this isolation in travelling. How different was the mode of getting from place to place fifty years since, when it took hours to go a small dis tance, and days to go a longer journey, under the care of the Messageries Royales, or Lafitte, Caillard, & Co. ! One was then necessarily compelled to asso ciate and take one's meals with one's compagnons de voyage ; thus a certain intercourse, and generally a pleasant interchange of civility and accommodat ing attentions, became part of the programme. Now a man gets into his railway carriage, makes"], [22, "FLYING SOUTH. 10 himself as comfortable as he can, goes to sleep if he can, and, barring accidents, knows nothing of what is happening in the world till he arrives at his destination. Sterne's Sentimental Journey could not be made now. Dreamy wanderings in the ' pleasant land of France ' are hardly to be had in these days. Wayside inns are turned to other purposes ; there is no longer any getting out to gossip while the horses are being changed, and lighting your cigar at a peasant's pipe ; no walking up the long hills, with incidents of chat and obser vation of the country, followed by the mad scamper down, the horses careering at their own sweet will, amid the cries of the driver of ' Serrez la me canique,' while addressing his steeds as his ' dear children,' his ' little pigs,' or 'infernal demons ;' the mountain of a diligence plunging and tacking over the paved chaussc'e till it rattles into some village, waking the echoes thereof, and making their arrival the great event of the day. Instead of all this, we are now the passive victims of a monotonous, dreary routine of mechanical locomotion. The French are so eminently a sociable and polite nation, that well-managed advances made to them will generally obtain cordial reception and response. ' A Frenchman will do anything for you,' a young Englishman declared to me, ' if only"], [23, "WOMAN'S INFLUENCE. 11 you take off your hat and call him Monsieur.' It is astonishing to see how patiently and encourag ingly they listen to attempts at talking their language when a stranger strives to address them in it. Not a muscle of their faces betrays their consciousness of the ludicrous, and sometimes one might almost say criminal, mistakes of the im perfect speaker. They certainly cultivate much amiability of manner, and successfully. One reason seems to be that the sexes work more together on the same level, and indeed resemble each other more than in England or Germany. Has not a Frenchman something more feminine than an Englishman, and a Frenchwoman something more socially independent than an Englishwoman ? No doubt there is a powerful female element among the Upper Ten Thousand with us, \u2014 powerful, I mean, in politics, as well as in taste, fashion, and morality. But I suppose the feminine influence exercised in the famous salons of the French capital stand alone in history for their undisputed sway over literature and art, as well as in the wider spheres just mentioned. And in private life the Frenchman turns to his wife for her opinion as habitually and trustfully as though she were truly the better half in their marriage contract. I wish to be understood as not expressing an opinion as"], [24, "FLYING SOUTH. 12 to which system is the better, theirs or ours, but merely as stating what seems to me a broad social distinction. Indeed, since the beginning of this century, Frenchwomen have taken a large share in the active business of life, and the laws enable them in many ways to make their own position, which they do without the smallest tinge of that result of self-assertion which we are in the habit of designat ing as ' strong-mindedness.' Coupled with the genial manners of the people, there is a striking independ ence, and absence of anything like servility, which probably arises from almost every individual being possessed of something in the way of property either in land or money. But while indulging my self in this sort of digression, my opinion was waited for as to the winter home to be selected ; and you will perceive that the cacoethes scribendi has seized upon me, and will have its way \u2014 too sententiously perhaps, as is apt to be the case with a man who has passed the grand climac teric. Enforced idleness in a foreign land leads very easily into dilettante trifling with thought, as with pen, ink, and paper. In answer, then, to the appeal made to me, I said, ' You may very well anchor in any of the seaside retreats between Toulon and Sarzana ; wherever you stop, you will, as Dr. Johnson or some other wise man said, find"], [25, "RESTLESSNESS. 13 something worth seeing, although not worth going to see ; however you may like your abode for a while, you will still be urged forward- \u2014 la-bas, la bas \u2014 finding no escape from the wandering impulse.' And with this oracular mode of disposing of the matter, I left it pretty much where it was before."], [26, "II. A DIGRESSION. Hyeres, January 1S81. IN illustration of the independence and sociability of the French, as well as of their possession of property, I may relate the course of a ramble one Sunday afternoon. After losing myself in the windings of the woods which surround Costebelle, I emerged, as one seems when wandering in that neighbourhood by some occult influence generally sure to do, on the Almanar road, leading to the village of Carqueyranne, and on that part of it at which the tongue of land connecting it with the peninsula of Giens takes its departure. Though midwinter, the road was hot and dusty, and no vehicle was to be expected at that hour likely to be of service to me. I stood rather tired, and doubtful whither to direct my steps, and at equal distance between my lodging-place and proposed destination, when a respectable-looking farmer in a"], [27, "A LIFT. 15 four-wheeled chaise, drawn by one comfortable and active horse, overtook me, and after the ever-ready friendly salutation inquired, ' Allez-vous a Car queyranne ? ' On my replying in the affirmative, he at once heartily invited me to get in, as he was going through that village. He was very com municative and pleasant during the drive of three miles or so, and finding me to be English, plied me with questions about my native land, particularly as to the crops produced and value of the land in my northern home. He seemed astonished and puzzled when he discovered that no vines are grown as crops in England ; and although continu ally exclaiming, ' Nous avons un beau climat,' ' C'est un beau climat, n'est ce pas ? ' was still full of fears as to the inroads of the dreaded 'phylloxera.' The ravages of this insect are almost incredible. A friend of mine, a native of Montpellier, assured me recently that he considered that town had been half ruined by the damage done by the phylloxera. Vine-growcs in the neighbourhood of Montpellier, who in good seasons formerly netted profits so large that in a single year the value of the fee simple of the land had been cleared, now find their property worse than unproductive. Hopes of a better future are, however, beginning to dawn, as it has been found that certain kinds of vine in"], [28, "FLYING SOUTH. 16 America are not attacked by the pest, and it has occurred to some of the growers to import into France the American plant enjoying this immu nity, and then graft the better sorts of French vine upon this stock, a process which they say promises to succeed. The phylloxera is an insect so very small as only to be visible through a microscope. My farmer friend spoke of wind as the great enemy of the farmer in these parts. This fear of the wind reminded me of our contrary view as expressed in the monkish saying, ' Anglia, si non ventosa, vene nosa.' Arrived at Carqueyranne we parted with ex pressions of mutual good-will and a hearty shake of the hand. As I was not desirous to attempt to return on foot, I began to make inquiries as to a conveyance back to Hyeres. Addressing myself to a man keeping a small wine-shop, he at once took me to a neighbouring house, and introduced me to the driver of the omnibus to and from Hyeres, who he said was one of his friends \u2014 ' II est de mes intimes,' \u2014 and secured a place for me. I thanked him, and ventured to offer him a franc for his trouble, which he declined, saying he did not wish for money, and holding out a not very clean hand in farewell (by the way, his class have adopted the habit of much handshaking), hoped for the"], [29, "VILLAGE CAIE. 17 pleasure of seeing me again on a future occasion. On my further questioning him where to find a place of refreshment, he directed me to a cafd at the end of the village. It formed part of a group of four or five houses, making one side of a strag gling street ; its exterior was wild and rough, with curtains replacing doors, as is often the case in the villages here. The entrance to the cafe was at the foot of several downward steps, and the appearance of the whole place was so humble, that I at first hesitated to go in, then made a plunge and entered. In a dark room I found a good-sized billiard table, at which two men were playing, whose appearance reminded one of bandits, such as are seen represented on the stage ; one of them, an old man in a scarlet jacket, stained and dirty, and with an insufficient right eye, leered at me with the other, giving me a villainous look, in strange contrast with his polite and cordial ' Bon jour, Monsieur.' Again a step or two down, and the salle a manger presented itself, darker even than the outside room, and furnished with two rows of tables, time-stained, though varied here and there by a white marble top. At one of these sat a group of three endimanche men, marvellously attired and playing at cards. The bustling land lady ensconced me in a corner, where a ray of C"], [30, "18 FLYING SOUTH. sunshine succeeded in penetrating, and would, she said, warm me. I could get no milk, but had a decent omelette and a tumbler of coffee. When I paid for my slight repast, the landlady asked if I were wanting to find a residence ; and pointing to a good-looking villa, on the hill behind the house, said it was her's, and pressed me so urgently to visit it with her, that I was, as it were, compelled to comply. It was a pretty stiff climb to the good lady's villa, which seemed the pride and delight of her heart, and I suspect still more of her husband's, for it was evident that while she had made up her mind to sell, ' papa,' as she called him, could not resign himself to the idea. We found him outside the house unharnessing a horse from a ramshackle cart, and to all his wife's appeals as to what price they should name, he remained absolutely dumb, looking at her and me with the expression of an animal driven to bay. Indeed, his wife complained that but for his reluctance she should have sold the place last year to a Russian prince ! At her bid ding, however, he slowly unbarred a shutter here and there, to exhibit the interior and the views of sea and mountain. Before the door, and under a vine tonnelle, stood a dusty, dilapidated old chaise, apparently en permanence, and on its moth-eaten cushions reposed several cats, about a dozen more"], [31, "SMALL FREEHOLDER. 19 of which animals encountered us within the house. The man and his wife, builders and owners of this dwelling, were living in it. On entering, to the right a red curtain shut off the kitchen from the passage, and in this kitchen the landlady exhibited with great pride a door leading into a stable adjoining, so that they could see to their cattle without going out of the house, and of course the odour was by no means fragrant. Opposite to this kitchen was a really good-sized salle a manger with two windows, a large table spread, dust everywhere ; the whole a curious mixture of display and squalor. These characteristics prevailed also above stairs, where on the first, and again on the second floor, were re- spectively two rooms and an alcove, each arranged as is usual in France, half as a sitting-room, half as a bedroom ; dirty boots, clothes of all sorts, odds and ends of crockery, being scattered right and left, while tolerable engravings hung awry on the walls, and under them sofas covered with velvet, protected by handsome couvrettes. All this was displayed with satisfaction by Madame Marcori, who then gave me the address of her lawyer at Hyeres, to whom she referred for price and conditions of sale, assuring me she should make a point of seeing him the very next day to talk the matter over with him. She spoke with complacency of her husband being a c 2"], [32, "FLYING SOUTH. 20 wine merchant as well as a cafe\" keeper, and then left me, recommending me to examine all her little property of eight acres, and particularly to observe the fine view it afforded of Toulon. I knew her lawyer, M. Patteson of Hyeres, and meeting him some weeks afterwards, inquired if Madame Marcori had been to him, and he replied that she had not, and that he knew nothing of her intention to sell her house or land. This good lady and her husband had risen from the poorest ranks, and were not at all exceptional instances of the result of years of the thrift and industry practised in France, sou upon sou being laid by with patient care. Madame Marcori's vague scheme of selling her property suggests perhaps a prosperous future for her little village, which is even warmer than Hyeres, and is already sought out by the English. This I was reminded of on leaving the place, and strolling a short way along the sea-shore, for I passed a pretty little dwelling close to the water, which bore prominently the name of ' Victoria Cottage,' no doubt the habitation of some Briton who prefers the shores of the Mediterranean to the banks of the Thames. These changes, so rapidly going on, set me moralising on the march of events since my younger days. An old fellow like myself is apt to be a"], [33, "SOCIAL CHANGE. 21 laudator temporis acti, and so loves rather to dwell on the past than to endeavour to describe the present. Although I have travelled in many coun tries, I recur always with pleasure to my beloved France, and a sense of being at home there is the result of having visited it frequently during a space of forty-eight years. I am satisfied that it was cheaper and certainly brighter and more interesting for the traveller fifty years ago than it is now. Provincial costumes have to a great extent disappeared, for one thing, and are being replaced by comparative sobriety and dulness in outward apparel. Politics naturally, and properly, engage more attention than they did, and one has to measure one's words and conceal one's thoughts. On the other hand \u2014 and a most important per contra it is, \u2014 I believe the people \u2014 the masses \u2014 were never so well off as now, better satisfied with their condition, or less disturbed by the changes of Ministry and squabbles in the Senate and Chamber at Paris. But before I leave them I must allude to the wonderful poco curante habits amongst my south ern friends here. They are not quite so bad as the Italian shopkeeper \u2014 -who in answer to your inquiry if he has an article you want, will reply, ' Chi lo sa ? ' But they come pretty nearly to this apparent in difference. I wanted the other day to despatch a"], [34, "FLYING SOUTH. 22 package to England. I went, as directed, to the ' Grand Bureau of International Agency correspond ing with all the Countries,' but though I called twice on one day and twice on a subsequent day, I could never encounter the gentleman who directed the affairs of the office. I saw two polite ladies, who announced themselves as his mother and wife, and who seemed to take the greatest interest in my welfare, but they could give no information, except the incorrect statement that the man I wanted was always to be found, and knew every thing I could possibly wish to inquire about. At the railway station I did not fare much better, and the clerks could not tell me what would become of my package after it left Paris, or whether it would go vid Boulogne or Calais. I am bound to add that the charge of the carrier who took it from the town to the station, a distance of more than a mile, was only five sous for his trouble, although the weight was 47 kilogrammes, that is over 100 lbs. The reflections with which I finished my Sun day's rambles among the peasants and their homes were confirmed by my observation of my fellow passengers in the omnibus, most of whom were young women returning home after their day's holiday, and whose self-possession, good manners, and air of cheerful content were very pleasing. On"], [35, "POUR BO IRE. 23 arriving at Hyeres I presented the driver with three sous for a ponr-boire as an experiment, and re ceived his hearty thanks. My comparison of ' now ' and ' formerly ' revived old recollections, some of which I will record in my next letter."], [36, "III. RETROSPECT. TllE comparison in my last letter between modern and old times brings back to me some early impressions. Well do I remember landing at Calais from Dover one afternoon in the month of May 1833. It was a Sunday, and the contrast between the sober propriety of the English port, and the noisy mirth of the French one, was a thing never to be forgotten. Calais was then any thing but the dead-alive place it has become in these days. It was the high road and first station, and a necessary halting-place, for all travellers on the Continent, and there was not a better hotel in Europe than Dessin's at that time. There was stir and bustle and life enough then in the place. Now it is sadly forlorn, deserted, and dead. The ' dili gence ' carried me to Boulogne-sur-Mer, that is to say, I went outside a regular English four-horsed"], [37, "BOULOGNE SUR A/ER. 25 coach, driven by an Englishman, and called 'the Telegraph.' It was an agreeable drive to Boulogne \u2014 and Boulogne was then, as now, a very pretty place. It has been the fashion for many years to decry it, probably on account of the motley group of Britons who took refuge there for economy, or because they had to ' leave their country for their country's good.' But for the town itself, I stoutly maintain that it is the handsomest and most picturesque of all the seaside watering-places between Dunkirk and Cherbourg inclusive. The entrance to the port, the quay with its beautiful trottoir, the fine race of fishermen and fisherwomen in their bright costumes, broad streets leading up to that called the Grande Rue, capped by the cathedral, which, though a rather pretentious modern building, stands imposingly ; the upper town, still ramparted, and having the old gates and castle in good preservation ; the pretty neigh bourhood, with the Vallee du Denacre, \u2014 all make it exceptionally attractive. I have visited it scores of times, have always loved it, and shall always keep a warm corner for it in my memory of favourite places. In those days Portel, where every inhabitant had a most picturesque costume, was a striking climax to a walk along the bold, tall cliffs. The village with its quaint houses, and its little river"], [38, "26 FLYING SOUTH. running down a gorge to the sea, often alive with chattering, laughing washerwomen, had fifty years ago plenty of material for the artist. This first journey is still vividly before me. After ten delightful days in Boulogne, the transit by diligence to Abbe ville, whose Grande Place and tower of St. Wolfran were, and still are, so striking ; diligence again thence to Dieppe, stopping at Eu, and getting a capital view of everything from the banquette ; then the well-known features of Dieppe and its quaint little opposite neighbour Puy. Off again by diligence to that crowning glory Rouen, the old capital of Nor mandy ; thence by steamer to Havre, leaving Rouen at four in the morning, and only reaching Havre at eight in the evening.in consequence of the opposition oftides and insufficient machinery. Then the journey by diligence to the ' capitale du monde civilise,' Paris, and the enchantment of a first visit to that bril liant city, captivating all the senses, the imagina tion, and the intellect. Oh the vivid pictures of youth, stamped with the vigour of early ecstasy in forms which never lose their grace, and painted in colours which no after dulness can obliterate or even dim ! No doubt the Roman's ' surgit amari aliquid ' was true at that happy time also, but the ' pleasures of memory ' cause the dash of bitterness to be for gotten, and only allow the joy, the brightness, and the morning novelty to remain."], [39, "PARIS IN 1S33. 27 Paris in 1833 was still palpitating with the ex citement caused by the moving events of' les trois glorieuses,' as they familiarly called July 27, 28, and 29, 1830, which drove Charles X. from France, and set up in his stead Louis Philippe, Roi des Franca is, but never King of France. The graves of the victims of July, some even in the town \u2014 near the Louvre, for instance \u2014 -were still decorated with immortelles or similar tributes, and received fre quent visits of mourners or sympathetic admirers. The bourgeois king and his family were constantly visible to the public, appearing at the civic balls at the Hotel de Ville, where the young princes joined in the dances with and as ordinary citizens, as I myself witnessed on this my first visit to Paris. I believe no restrictions were imposed, all properly dressed persons being admitted ; at least, I know that I myself gained entrance to the crowded assembly without any ticket or introduction. That grand building, so full of historical interest, and now, alas ! no more, was then in its utmost splendour, and decorated for the occasion of which I am speaking, with the brilliancy of effect which the French know so well how to produce.

On the occasion of unveiling the statue of Napo leon I. in the Place Vendome, the whole of the Champs Elysees and the Place de la Concorde were filled with troops of the line and national guards, amounting together, they said, to 200,000 men ; and it took, as I can bear witness, from ten o'clock in the morning till four in the afternoon for these troops merely to pass round and salute the statue. The king and his court were stationed on the Place, surrounded with royal pomp. What astonished me most was the magnificent appearance of the cavalry. When the show was over, I jokingly remarked to a bystander that this was enough to frighten us English : and he answered, with seriousness, ' Oh no, we don't want to frighten you ; it is the Prussians who are our bete noire! This was the most imposing gathering of troops I ever beheld. One of the institutions existing in Paris in 1833 was the gambling-table : some were in the Palais Royal, and I believe elsewhere, but the celebrated one of Frascati was in the Rue Richelieu, and a sight one was expected to see. The entrance hall was noble, and obsequious lackeys in gorgeous apparel politely relieved you of your hat and coat , and waved you to the grand staircase, which led to a fine suite of rooms, in which a motley group were assembled, some madly staking large sums at rouge-"], [41, "PARIS IN 1833. 29 et-noir or roulette ; whilst others, and amongst them respectable people \u2014 such, for instance, as the well-known Benjamin Constant \u2014 would sit for an hour or more pricking a card to mark the number of times each colour had turned up, and at length would put down their louis or other modest sum, win or lose this their one stake, and then quietly go away, satisfied with the result of what to them was a scientific calculation. In the days I am speaking of, the appearance of Paris was very different from its present aspect ; many quarters which have now disappeared had then their original cachet. Probably few persons now remember the mass of gloomy, dirty houses, some of very doubtful character, which existed between the Tuileries and the Louvre, and also behind the Madeleine, where now the Boulevard Malesherbes and the Pare Monceau gratify the taste. The Rue des Lombards was like a street in some medi\u00e6val Italian town, and in various corners bits of the original Lutece yet lingered. By the way, there is still a curious suggestion left of what the Boulevards once were, namely, the ramparts of the city. This is in the approach from the Boule vard Poisson niere to the porcelain and glass ware houses of Messrs. Reichenbach & Co., called 'Maison"], [42, "FLYING SOUTH. 30 du Pont de Fer,' on the north side of the boulevard, No. 14, where a bridge is carried over what was once the moat round the ramparts. The Place Royale, now the Place des Vosges, was with some respectable classes a favourite place of residence. It has of late years found itself too near the Quartier St. Antoine, but is worth attention for its stately, rich red old houses, and its curious arcades. In many of the streets of Paris when I first knew it the r/vebere or lantern hung over the centre of the street, and was lowered or raised by a rope and pulley in the adjoining wall, explaining the terrible cry, too well known in the first revolution, of ' A la lanterne ;' and the gutters also ran uncovered down the middle of the street, carrying along liquid of miscellaneous composition, which the rapid passage of a carriage dispensed right and left so profusely, that the scared pedestrian on its approach eagerly shrank into a shop or porte cochcre to avoid being e'clabousse. To visit the environs there were no railways, tramways, or omnibuses ; the diligence or other public vehicles of limited accommodation carried you. Amongst them, conspicuous for the inexpli cable, almost impossible, inaptitude of its construc tion, and its ludicrous inconvenience, causing many a gay laugh, and sympathetic expression of com-"], [43, "PARIS OPERA IN 1833. 31 passion for yourself and fellow-travellers, was the one-horse coucou, something like a swollen, diseased hansom cab on four wheels, with the driver perched somewhere on the roof or on the dashing board, and the passengers bumping against each other, and arriving at their destination tired, sore, and merry. The Grand Opera was, I think, in the height of its glory in the days I am gossiping about \u2014 Nourrit, Levasseur, Madlle. Falcon, Madame Dorus Gras, and Madame Cinti Damoreau and her husband for opera (Rossini said the last-named lady sang his music better than any soprano of that day) ; Taglioni and Fanny Ellsler for the ballet. There never was, and I think never will be, dancing equal to Taglioni's ; it was like a wave of the sea. ' Elle danse si bien des bras,' said Talleyrand. One evening, behind the scenes, when she was going on in ' The Sylphide,' I myself won from her a smile and an acknowledgment. A companion of mine remarking on the wings which were part of her costume, I said, ' Mais il me semble que ses jambes sont des ailes.' She immediately turned round with, ' Merci, Monsieur, c'est un tres joli compliment.' Her whole action and movement were grace itself, and never suggestive of any thing but poetry and elegant art. Her private life was irreproachable, in every respect she was"], [44, "FLYING SOUTH. 32 sui generis, and the Queen of Dancers. To see her in ' Sylphide,' a ballet composed and arranged for her by Nourrit, was to see the realisation of a dream in fairy-land. And this was the more remarkable as she was by no means striking in appearance, certainly not beautiful, and in figure too spare and thin. But once in motion, she was the incarnation of perfect elegance and grace ful undulation. The Parisians are keen critics of actors and acting'. A Frenchman must have his theatre, and is not easily pleased. One of the indulgences afforded to the populace, to mark the anniversaries of the three days of July before alluded to, was the spectacle gratis, or absolutely free admission to whomsoever could find a place, and seats were obtainable by any one who chose to go early enough, and patiently ' make tail.' The order enforced by the Parisians and their police has one example in the queue, which no one attempts to break. I attended one of these gratuitous perform ances, and never saw ' Robert le Diable ' played or sung better. I had that day previously called on Nourrit, the unique tenor : I say ' unique,' for he had a voice and style cf his own. I had the advantage of being intimate with him, and I was foolish enough to ask him if he intended to sing"], [45, "PARIS FOR ALL MEN. 33 his best. ' Certainly,' he said ; ' my audience to-day will find out and never forgive me if I do not do all in my power to please them.' I found myself carried nearly off my feet by the crowd into the boxes. Next to me was a man in his shirt sleeves ; to look at him you would have supposed he might hardly be fit to judge of 'a score of fat bullocks at Stamford fair.' But his remarks were most appropriate, and his applause only given when well merited. He was evidently a good judge as to the singing of Nourrit and Levasseur, and the dancing of the Noblets in the cemetery scene. But it was not all 'play' at Paris. Casual visitors look upon that delightful capital as a place of amusement only. In fact, however, a man may have every variety of serious employment, religion, politics, legal study, scientific research, artistic and literary occupation, and, if he is fortunate enough to get into it, society of the best and most refined sort. The man of strict religious views and ob- servance may find seclusion as in a desert ; the politician certainly has almost daily matter of contemplation, and thought, and bewilderment in the frequent changes of ministries, and the heated discussions in the Chamber ; the student in any branch of science or art finds ample field and D"], [46, "FLYING SOUTH. 34 opportunity to exercise his mind in the public gratuitous lectures and general facilities of all kinds ; and the literary man has free access to the library of the State and many others. In short, Paris adapts itself to every one, and is ' all things to all men.' In no other city is the foreigner so welcomed, so aided, and so free to follow his bent. And this is as true now as it was in the times I have been speaking of. But there is a good solid backbone of very hard workers, whose habit it is to rise at daylight, winter and summer, take a small cup of coffee 'to wake them,' and then to their day's labour, which is protracted till bedtime : of these, the visitor for pleasure sees and knows nothing. Smoke is excluded, no manufactories being allowed in the capital ; even lately the tram ways propelled by steam have been suppressed ; but the workers of articles de Paris and others carry on their delicate trades industriously. The first three years of his reign did not appear to me to have placed Louis Philippe very firmly on the throne, and we all know that he was very far indeed from reposing on a bed of roses. He had many pretty severe passages to work through, from the Phillipon caricature of his pear-like face, and the Robert Macaire jokes, up to the horrible Fieschi attempt, from which he escaped, as it were,"], [47, "'DESCENTE' AT NEWHAVEN. 35 by a miracle. Gradually his prestige failed, and after the unfortunate death of the Duke of Orleans, things went from worse to worse, till that boisterous night of March 2, 1848, when he left Havre in a Southampton steamer under the name of ' Smith,' and landed at Newhaven, putting up at a modest hostelry, on which may still be read the inscription, ' A la descente de Louis Philippe,' words which carry a history and a moral in themselves. d 2"], [48, "IV. RETROSPECT (continued). Turning from Paris to its nearest commercial port, the second in rank in France, the Havre of 1833 strikes me as having altered more than most of the important places with which I am familiar. It was then a comparatively small town of 28,000 inhabitants, fortified and confined within ramparts and ditches, and over the latter were drawbridges ; the gates were closed at midnight, and it was often difficult to obtain admission after that hour. The docks were limited in number, being composed of the two communicating with the avant-port, and the larger one running up to the Place du Spectacle. As far as Harfleur existed marshy and open ground, where now are splendid and commodious new basins. The entrance to the avant-port was so narrow as to necessitate the destruction of the ancient Tour Francois Premier (the only piece of"], [49, "HAVRE IN 1833. 37 antiquity the town possessed) when Napoleon the Third directed the enlargement of the harbour and the removal of the ramparts, moats, bridges, &c, throwing all open, and including Ingouville with the parent town. Together they now count about 100,000 souls. The village of Sainte Adresse, in the time I am speaking of, was a little rural retreat, with no villas or houses other than a few cottages where one used to get milk and eggs. There was not a building of any pretension in the town except the theatre, and the French always spoke despite fully of H&vre for its inartistic appearance and rough climate. As to the climate, Sir Jonah Bar rington wrote that on the cote a doctor was wanted never, on the mi-cole once a month, in the town every day. The place had, however, much that was attractive, the society at the villas on the Cote d'Ingouville was most agreeable, the balls and dances frequent, and inspirited by good music. Subscription balls at the theatre, where the pit was floored over on these occasions, were held regularly every two or three weeks. The cotton trade was at that time in one of its seasons of highest prosperity, and a generous hospi tality and tasteful expenditure were met with in the houses of the wealthy. A good deal of play went on in private circles, and at the club some-"], [50, "FLYING SOUTH. 38 times for high stakes. Bouillotte was then the game a la mode. The cote at Havre offers fine views on every side, towards the sea, up the Seine, and across to Honfleur. The places worth visiting in the neigh bourhood are numerous and various. The Bois de Lalatte, the rich Valley of Gournay, the little town of Harfleur, with its river, the Lezarde, its church and beautiful spire, of which some French author wrote of the latter, \u2014 ' C'est le clocher d' Harfleur qui vient nous apprendre Que les Anglais l'ont bati, n'ont su le defendre.' The reader will remember the allusion to our occupation in the play of Henry V., \u2014 'Come, Uncle Exeter Go you and enter Harfleur \u2014 there remain ; . . . . we'll retire to Calais. To-night in Harfleur will we be your guest.' Beyond Harfleur is the picturesque and most interesting old town of Montvilliers. Near the former place is the Park of Orcher, with its noble terrace overlooking the Seine, and almost remind ing one of the terrace of St. Germain. Then further on, the truly striking castle and grounds of Tancarville, crossing the Seine ; Honfleur with its Cote de Grace, Pont Au de Mer, and Lisieux, all within a day's walk. The fashionable modern bathing-place, Trouville, was not beyond a ride"], [51, "HAVRE IN 1833 39 from Honfleur, but in 1833 it was so small a village, that an equestrian party of which I made one, could not find a meal there, and had to return to Honfleur for dinner. Fair shooting was to be had in many parts of Normandy half a century ago ; and it was not difficult for a resident foreigner to make acquaint ance with the farmers, who would let you share their humble meal and give you a ' shake down,' rather rough to be sure, but ' dans un grenier qu'on est bien a vingt ans.' By the way, the principal food of the farmers of Normandy in that day was bread, and their drink cider, literally and truly. They seldom \u2014 hardly ever \u2014 ate meat or any of their own poultry. Yet they would never accept money in return for their hospitality, though a little present of fresh meat or fish was not refused. The facilities for shooting game were at least as restricted as in England, for of course you could only shoot over the land of the man who gave you leave to do so ; and it is ludicrously difficult to be sure you keep on your friend's ground, for the subdivision is so great that you are obliged to pick your way care fully, and are besides constantly coming across notices of ' Defense de chasser,' ' Chasse reservee,' and so on. Game was scarce.

Remarking to a French lady that there were many dogs in a town I visited, she replied, ' Yes, but there are many chasseurs. ' Is there then much game?' ' There are many thrushes,' replied she. Indeed, the Frenchman's idea of sport is very different from ours. The stag hunt at Fontainebleau, for instance, has little resemblance to that in Buckinghamshire. In two or three respects it is superior, as they do not bring the deer in a cart, and the animal they hunt is a royal wild red deer. Staying (it was in 1S60) at an inn at Fontainebleau, the landlord informed me there would be a grand chasse in the forest next morning, and that I ought to go. I asked him if he could supply me with a good mount, and was astonished when he confidently affirmed that the best way to 'hunt the deer' was in a four-wheeled waggonette, and that driven, as I should be, by a garcon of great intelligence I should see every thing, and come in at the death ! ! I was persuaded by him, and accordingly mounted my four-wheeler in the morning betimes, and arrived at the meet early.

The Emperor was to have been there, but did not come, and was represented by the Baron Lambert. After solemn consultation as to the whereabouts of a fine stag which had been tracked the night before, the dogs were sent in about 1 1 A.M., and were soon in ardent pursuit. Very little of the actual chase was witnessed by those who came for the sport ; the hounds and their victim had it nearly all to themselves, because the underwood was so thick, it was impossible to ride or drive into it. Gallopings up and down the cleared alleys, occasionally crossed by the pack, and the excitement of blowing large horns, seemed to constitute the sport. This, with occasional checks and renewed starts, went on till about six in the evening, but many of the company had dropped off by that time. I myself had had about enough of this blind-man's buff work, and told my driver to take me to the hotel to the dinner I had ordered at half-past six. But just then there was a great flourish of horns in the distance, and my very intel- ligent garcon assured me this sound indicated that the poor stag was hurrying towards and meant to take to the water, in which case he would certainly be captured and killed. I submitted, and we set off at a smart hand gallop, and arrived at a"], [54, "FLYING SOUTH. 42 large lake just in time to see the weary brute plunge into the water ; the hounds followed him, and persecuted his hocks and hind quarters. He made the best fight he could, till two of the hunts men came up with him in a boat. They were armed with short carbines, but did not use them, for throwing a cord round the horns of their prey, they easily dragged him to the shore, where he lay pant ing. And then followed an unpalatable scene. They first cut the stag's throat, then removed his four feet and proceeded to disembowel him. Di rectly the dogs saw the commencement of this work they gathered round clamouring, and were with difficulty kept off by the huntsmen's whips till the operation was complete and the stuff thrown to them, when they pounced upon it, the cors de cliasse sounding encouraging music the while. A circle of elegantly dressed ladies contemplated with lively interest this repulsive scene. As I was leav ing the spot an indignant peasant addressed me with ' Ca n'est pas gai. Et voyez done toutes ces belles dames, Monsieur \u2014 on concoit maintenant comment elles peuvent voir guillotiner un homme. Ca n'est pas gai.'

Marseilles of course stands first among the ports of France, then Havre (which receives about three fourths of all the cotton imports), then Bordeaux. Marseilles is very cosmopolitan and very rich, making \u2014 in the interiors at least \u2014 greater display of luxury and expenditure than Paris herself. But it is a seaport from which one does not behold the sea, whereas at Havre the ships come bounding in by the pier, so that you can almost shake hands with those on board. Marseilles, however, has a magnificent natural harbour, one of the finest in the world. The place shows a strong Oriental element, Greeks, Turks, Arabs, and Hebrews mixing with the Provengal and other sons of the south. The climate is most treacherous, \u2014 one should never venture from home without an additional garment or wrap at hand. Flowers are little cultivated in the neighbourhood of Marseilles, although one would"], [57, "MARSEILLES. 45 at [first imagine otherwise on seeing the women, who sell them, enthroned as they are, a I'ltalienne, amongst a mass of blossom in the open spaces near the Cannebiere. Each vendor occupies a little bower raised some feet above the ground, with a shelf or counter before her on which her brilliant merchandise is temptingly displayed. The flowers themselves, however, come from Paris and the Riviera ; the gardens of this wealthy city being almost exclusively devoted to the growth of vege tables and fruits, illustrating the habits of its citi zens, who prefer substantial creature comforts to \u00e6sthetic adornments. Their houses and manner of living denote the same taste, being replete with gorgeous rather than tasteful decoration ; while their tables are loaded with costly profuseness. Indeed, the whole tone of the city rather indicates an absence of the artistic taste so generally pre valent in France ; which is the more remarkable in Marseilles, as it presents so much general mag nificence. Fine public buildings are scarce ; but a new cathedral is in progress, which promises to be an imposing and certainly a very large one. Long champ has a grand garden and public museum. The Church of Notre Dame de la Garde, with its image of the Virgin, occupies a remarkable position on a solid pyramidical rock, and has a most ex-"], [58, "46 FLYING SOUTH. tensive view over the harbour, the islands, and the sea, and it attracts the steps of many pious visitors, with whom vendors of candles and votive offerings do a large business outside the church. The old town on the slope of the hill going up to the church has on the whole rather forbidding features, and looks like a place one would not wish to linger in alone at midnight. The politics of this city are of rather an advanced liberal colour, but the munici- pality built an enormous and costly chateau for the Emperor Napoleon III. about six years before his downfall, which has never been inhabited, and stands forlorn, overlooking the port. The natural features of the neighbourhood tell of an arid soil, with large plains and bare craggy mountains. An element of wild Salvator Rosa-ish ruggedness pre- vails, striking but not seductive. Nevertheless on a fine day, when the atmosphere is not too start- lingly clear, as is apt to be the case in the south, the mountains landward assume most delicate aerial effects, and then the sea and inland views are ex- quisite. The ineffably soft lights and shades tone down the harsh masses of bare limestone, and refine them into every imaginable tender tint of cloud colour. This magical transformation is true of the mountains of the same formation northward of Marseilles, and as far eastward as Hyeres, beyond"], [59, "SOUTHERN VEGETATION. 47 which place the softer Maure mountains, which are tossed about in a succession of undulating lines, entirely alter the character of the scenery.

Here you may wander for hours under trees which are all the year round decked in most spring-like verdure, and though your feet are tried with the rough and roll ing stones of the innumerable paths, you forget such discomfort whilst on every side the eye is attracted by rich masses of vegetation, with which few even carefully cultivated gardens could vie. In a sunny corner at Christmas I have found myr tles covered with blossom, while honeysuckle also in full bloom turned in and out among the white flowers, scenting the air all round, and arbutus rich with flower and fruit, gay butcher's-broom, its scarlet berries shining through its glistening leaves of bright green, the crimson berries of the Simlax aspera like bunches of tiny grapes, the delicate pale periwinkle, the blue borage, scarlet poppy, giant daisies, and many more.

There are oaks of various sorts, some retaining their autumn gold and crimson into the young days of the new year ; and others not deciduous, cork and ilex, subduing with neutral tones this world of rich and varied colour. Bordeaux, which ranks after Havre as a port, is a place very distinctly different from either of its two busier sisters. In geographical position, in its distance from the sea, the nature of its business, the character of its inhabitants and surroundings, it is all unlike them. It is of the three ports the one I fancy I should most like to inhabit permanently. There is an air of sober, self-contented well-to do-ness in its own aspect and in the bearing of its denizens. The splendid quays, three miles long, which run by the side of the noble river, are hardly equalled anywhere. The Place des Quinconces has a character and beauty of its own. The long stone bridge over the"], [61, "BORDEA UX. NANTES. 49 Garonne of seventeen arches, and about a third of a mile long, and its rival the railway bridge, having a path for pedestrians on one side, are both very remarkable objects : the town itself is well built and stately. The Grand Opera is fine \u2014 perhaps in France next to that of Paris. The export wine trade is the principal business. The vessels going out and coming in annually do not exceed those of the port of Boulogne, which has been increasing steadily whilst Bordeaux has been falling off. There is a monument of antiquity at Bordeaux not commonly noticed \u2014 the Palais Gallien, a con siderable remnant of what is supposed to have been a Roman amphitheatre : the gates and some of the walls now existing give a good idea of what it must have been. Nantes should come next ; it once stood before Havre in importance, but has decreased of late years. Large vessels cannot come up to the town, but anchor at Paimb\u0153uf, thirty miles off. Its quays were fine, but are now spoiled by the railway run ning through them, and cutting off access to the Loire ; an extraordinary act of Vandalism, as it seems to the visitor, and probably very injurious to the local industry. Brandy is the great article of export at Nantes, as wine at Bordeaux, but there E"], [62, "FLYING SOUTH. 50 are many manufactures, as the daily smoke testifies. Sardines are a large article of commerce. The edict published here by Henry IV. in 1598 will always be remembered by Protestants, although its revocation by the Grand Monarque eighty-seven years afterwards left a greater mark still on the pages of history. There is a beautiful public garden, and a fine promenade or square by the cathedral, but taken as a whole, Nantes is not riant. The traveller will find the hotels below par. In a town of 120,000 inhabitants, and of so much commercial activity, it is marvellous that there is not a single really good hotel ; the Hotel de France is perhaps the best, but ' bad is the best.' The steamboat excursions up the Loire are delightful, and many exquisitely beautiful scenes present themselves formed by the windings of the river, and the various places enlivening its banks all the way to Angers. Nantes is, however, not a town in which an idle man would be tempted to take up his abode. Pornic in La Vendee, a picturesque and primitive little bath ing-place and seaport, is an agreeable retreat from Nantes and much frequented by the Nantois, but it will soon lose its cachet now that is has a cheap railway (only opened about five years ago), which brings annually an increasing number of temporary visitors, and is causing new and staring villas"], [63, "PORNIC. 51 rto arise on the high ground overlooking the little port.

The neighbouring bathing-places of Prefaille and La Bernerie are the roughest, wildest, and most eccentric seaside resorts possible ; I never saw any such elsewhere, except perhaps Cayeux, but they, like the latter, are quite the fashion, and much in favour with Parisians. My housekeeping at Pornic was original and very cheap. I found a most respectable ' ex-Lieu tenant des Douanes,' a bachelor, occupying a small house on the quay, living in it alone, his femme de charge coming in the daytime to 'do for' him. For a consideration of forty francs a week he ceded to me his brick-floored parlour and two good bed rooms, together with a joint interest in his kitchen and the invaluable services of his housekeeper Marie Celina Massonnet, whose board was to be on my account. She was everything in one person, bought, fed, and killed the poultry, purchased all I wanted, E 2"], [64, "FLAIAG SOUTH. 52 cooked, made the beds, waited on me, cleaned my chaussure \u2014 in short, was purveyor, butcher, cook, housemaid, waitress, valet, and shoe-black : all this for her keep, and the gratuity I gave her when we parted. Excellent Marie ! she would cook my dinner with a handful of braise and a little wood, and would hardly believe me when I told her that in England the majority of bourgeois householders lit a large coal fire, even in summer, between six and seven in the morning, chiefly in order to roast a joint and cook some dish of vegetables for a half past six o'clock dinner. The prices at which she purchased for me were low indeed \u2014 fowls twenty two sous each, twelve eggs for thirteen sous, seven small whiting for four sous, eight fine figs for two sous ; and she was nevertheless always lamenting that she could not prevent the vendors from raising their prices, because they knew she was buying for an e'tranger. She was thirty-four, and had a help less husband of thirty-two, a son of ten years old, and a history. Her story is probably but too much like that of many others. She had married in 1869 a bright, industrious youth \u2014 a joiner by trade \u2014 and they got on prosperously till the German war of 1870 broke out ; then in that terrible winter of 1870-71 ' They took my husband from me,' said Marie,"], [65, "A WAR VICTIM. 53 because the two great men, the King of Prussia and the French Emperor, fell out.

But I must work for the three of us now, without any more asking.' Such was Marie's pathetic narration.

The botanical gardens, too, well deserve mention, as richer in many splendid and rare trees, and especially in summer 'bedding out' plants, than any similar garden I have anywhere visited. The skill ex- hibited in the arrangement of these latter would serve as a lesson to all students of modern garden- ing, having a softness as well as brilliancy of colouring and effect which renders them exquisitely beautiful. Nor can I leave Rennes without also particularizing the glorious scenery through which flows the river Vilaine between it and Redon. This beautiful tract of country is, strange to say, ignored by the guide-books, but it would furnish new and most delightful exploring ground to the English tourist who seeks novelty and beauty within a very moderate distance of home. This is, however, a digression, and resuming the classifica- tion I have been attempting, by naming the com- mercial centres of Lyons, the largest French manufacturing town, and Lille, full of the intellec tual activity of the north, with Rouen, Elb\u0153uf, and Amiens, I include in this brief list the chief manu-"], [70, "58 FLYING SOUTH. facturing inland places ; few indeed to set against the multitudinous hives of industry yearly crowding out the agriculturist more and more in the length and breadth of our little island ; and the fact comprises a whole commentary upon the diver gences between us and our brilliant neighbours. Among the groups into which the towns of France seem naturally to arrange themselves, none is, I think, more remarkable than the group con taining striking and important Roman remains ; and here the traveller feels, as in too many other instances of a similar kind, how much we might copy with advantage from the French. Why are our own treasures of antiquity left so often to rude hands, one cannot say to be preserved, for they are seldom really strengthened and watched and restored, as is everywhere done so effectually in France. It is well, therefore, that so large a portion of the splendid work of the Romans remains in French keeping, as we see when we recall the exceedingly numerous Roman stations in the south of France, where, indeed, the majority of ancient towns possess such vestiges of the past ; though even in the north, Lillebonne, in Normandy, an hour's journey from Havre, contains a remark able amphitheatre. Nismes, Aries, Limoges, Rheims. Vienne, &c, are pretty fully described in"], [71, "CARCASSONNE. 59 the guide-books, but there are many spots off the regular beaten track of travellers which are scarcely less rich in Roman ruins. Among these is Frejus, hereafter mentioned. Autun is not very fre quently visited, and yet it was the ' soror et \u00e6mula Rom\u00e6,' and possesses an aqueduct, a temple of Janus, two fine gates, and other relics of the conquerors of the world. All these hardly exceed in interest the town of Carcassonne. The old cite' of that name, although not showing traces of Roman impression, is not very much younger than the towns just spoken of. It is said to have arisen in the days of Gothic invasion, and to contain evidence in some of its existing buildings of such origin. As it now stands, it is a perfect specimen of an old feudal fortress of the eleventh or twelfth century, and is most remarkable ; the gates, moats, towers, ramparts, castle, church, and external walls having been preserved and restored very skilfully, so that the venerable place looks much as it must have done seven centuries ago. It is nearly half an hour's walk from its sister, the new town of Car cassonne, in which the modern traveller puts up. Starting from the excellent hotel ' St. Jean Baptiste ' on a fine morning, I strolled up from it to visit the old specimen of architectural defiance,"], [72, "60 FLYING SOUTH. which it would be impossible to miss, standing as it does on the apex of a hill commanding the Aude and the neighbouring country, and having a distant view of the Pyrenees. The gradual approach was very impressive, and the walk up the ascent, across the wide moat, through the grand old gateway into the medi\u00e6val town, even now alive with inhabit ants engaged in different occupations, seemed like a chapter of romance. I almost expected to see mailed and visored knights, followed by their squires, moving about in the squares and streets, instead of ordinary French artisans of unpoetical modern life. The remains of the castle are well preserved and striking, and the interior of the grand old church of St. Nazaire most beautiful. The cite of Carcassonne, in short, furnishes a specimen of antiquity so perfect as to be probably without a rival. Its narrow streets and its curious houses, some of which are so old as to be past saving from decay, cowering for protection under the shadow of the castle, form a living page of ancient history. I have seldom seen a place which turned out so utterly different from what I had imagined. I had pictured to myself in Carcassonne one, instead of two separate and distinct towns, the new patched on to the old as in so many instances. But here the two have no connection"], [73, "CARCASSONNE. CETTE 61 with each other, and the old keeps its younger neighbour at a respectful distance, and looks proudly down on its upstart offshoot. After wandering about the ancient stronghold, I came out and walked all round it, and was then even more impressed than at first with the compact completeness of the general effect, and I slowly turned away down the hill, gazing back frequently as different points presented themselves. A second visit in the afternoon confirmed the interest of the morning, and I wondered that any one travelling in the south of France should leave it without seeing this still existing model of a town of such early date. Here, as everywhere else in France just now, signs are continually presenting themselves in proof of the severity and energy which prevail in every branch of military training, and my last sight of the cite of Carcassonne was enlivened by the man\u0153uvres of a body of infantry, winding in picturesque lines of colour about the mounds and round the bastions of the grim fortress, which served admirably as an exercise ground, and for displaying the light-footed dexterity which is inherent in the French soldier. Cette, only three hours from Carcassonne, and less than an hour from Montpellier, should not"], [74, "62 FLYING SOUTH. be overlooked by the philosopher or the wine merchant, although to the pleasure seeker it is naught. The place flourishes on making false wines under the names of popular growths. It used to be said that there were announcements stating, ' Ici l'on fabrique les vins de tous les pays.' I cannot say I saw any such declaration. But there is evidently an enormous trade, and it is quite understood that a common Spanish wine is imported which is made up into anything ordered. The breakwater and harbour are very fine, and the extensive quays admirably adapted for the recep tion and shipping of goods. The town itself is deplorably uninviting, the upper part filthily dirty ; and I cannot imagine anyone residing there ex cept for the purpose of filling his pockets and going away as fast as possible. There are, nevertheless, a few large residences, and one or two of these are inhabited by persons who are not in business and not compelled to live at Cette, but who from long habit or early associations may possibly find in the unattractive town ' Elysian beauty, melancholy grace.' Speaking of the noteworthy towns of France fifty years ago no one would have dreamt of omit ting Montpellier, the neglect of which during recent years is curious."], [75, "MONTPELLIER. 63 It was formerly much resorted to as a favour able shelter for people with weak chests. The principal hotel there, Hotel de Nevet, was one of the best and the very largest in France. Now no English go to Montpellier, probably because the guide-books speak of it as ungenial, dusty, and ex posed to mistral. It is, however, a town well worth visiting \u2014 well-built, clean, and with snow mountains to the north, the Pyrenees to the west, and high, bold hills near Cette to the south. The Promenade du Peyron is certainly one of the finest things of the sort in Europe ; there is no individual spot of the same size in Paris more beautiful. The museum and picture gallery are very handsome, and have an interest of their own, from having their origin in the library and collection of Alfieri, through whom the Countess of Albany, friend of the last of the Stuarts, became possessor of them, and gave them to M. Fabre, a merchant of Marseilles, the founder of the present museum, to which he gave his name. The inhabitants of Montpellier have obtained, and certainly seem to me to deserve, a character for amiability. As a proof how little the English are known there now, I may mention that two clerks at the Post Office, of whom I made enquiry, could not tell when letters from or to"], [76, "64 FLYING SOUTH. England arrived or were despatched, and the bankers to whom I was addressed did not know they were on the list of foreign correspondents of the Union Bank of London. Take it altogether, Protestantism does not flourish in France. There are about 1,000 at Montpellier, and they have not ' a good time,' for the Catholic priests do all in their power to annoy them, and to prevent their own people having any communication with the heretics. I learnt from some Protestant friends of mine many instances of the intolerance of the priesthood. The differences among the Protestants themselves are also an element of weakness. Among the 1,000 spoken of, there are three parties, the strong Calvinists, the moderates, and the extremely ' ad vanced.' They make together 'a house divided against itself.' I began this letter by speaking of the physical varieties of France ; and how great they are will be seen if we compare with the vast plains of the north the mountainous district of Auvergne and that of Languedoc. Drive, for instance, from Langeac on the river Allier, a little station upon the Mediterranean line, to the town of Le Puy, a distance of twenty-six miles, only recently broken in upon by a railway ;"], [77, "LANGEAC TO LE PUY. 65 the highest point in this distance being 4,000 feet above the sea. Siangues St. Romain is the only village of any size in this route. The two chateaux of Lafayette are striking objects on either side of the way : although now in ruins they would easily be convertible into splendid modern residences. The one called ' Le Manoir,' especially, commands a view quite as fine as many which have a great name in Switzerland. In front, a gorge clad with pines, with a little stream in the hollow, and as far as the eye can reach beyond, a billowy sea of mountain ranges, the whole remarkable enough to warrant an expression used by my French neigh bour at the homely table d'hote of my Langeac hotel, who said, speaking of this very drive, ' C'est un pays propre a nous faire mettre a genoux.' Beautiful as is this scenery, there is in all the dis trict a remarkable paucity of water. The Allier is but a shallow, rapid mountain stream ; the Borne at Le Puy is still smaller, and besides these two, only three or four mere brooklets are seen in all the route. The whole of this thinly-peopled region is very picturesque ; but the ancient town of Le Puy itself is even more remarkable. One descends upon it from the high regions I have been de scribing. It lies in a plain, which is diversified by several abrupt needle-shaped rocks of very consi- F"], [78, "FLYING SOUTH. 66 derable elevation, and extremely precipitous. Two of the most striking are within the town itself, and tower above the streets and houses, with an effect as imposing as might be produced by transplanting some of the Egyptian pyramids into the enclosure of a country town. One of these extraordinary rocks is crowned by a church, and the architect had to exercise great ingenuity to adapt the edifice to so singular a foundation ; the other supports an enor- mous bronze statue of the Virgin and child, placed there by direction of the late Empress. Cannon taken at Sebastopol furnished the material. By a conception more curious than beautiful, the interior is ascended by means of a spiral staircase, and a tall man can stand upright in the head of the image. The general effect of this huge statue is far from pleasing \u2014 it injures the neighbouring monu- ments by making them look small. There was formerly at Le Puy a statue of Isis, which Louis IX. brought from Egypt in 1254, and sanctified as a statue of the Virgin : it was destroyed in 1793 during the Revolution. The present monster can hardly be considered a substitute ; indeed, there is in the cathedral an imitation of the Egyptian one, which was worked by a sculptor of the town from his recollections of that which was destroyed It is quaint and grim, as is the old cathedral, which,"], [79, "LE PU\\ 67 however, is quite a museum of wonders for the antiquarian, and so is the old town itself, revealing in many parts an origin very remote. Of course the railway is fast altering the district, where, till lately, all the women wore caps with enormous borders, and a binding of broad ribbon tied in front of the head in bows as large as the antlers of a deer, or a round embroidered crown bound to the head with a gay ribbon, and trimmed with more or less expensive thread lace made in the neighbourhood. This lace may be described as a more solid sort of Valenciennes, and must, one should say, last for ever. It is made principally in the mountains near Arlan. To English travellers in France, familiar with the interminable straight lines of road, bordered by tall, scraggy trees, which form the principal features of the northern landscape, the mountainous high ways of Languedoc come as a great surprise ; and as a specimen of marvellous railway engineering, the line from Langeac to Alais probably stands among the most remarkable in the world. A French friend, an ironmaster at Alais, assured me that there were 1 13 tunnels between the two places just named, a distance of only 95 miles. During the first part of these 95 miles we were surrounded by the same high hills nearly approaching to f 2"], [80, "68 II.YIAG SOUTH mountains, through which had lain the route to and from Le Puy, but at Langogne they ceased ; and, misled by my northern experience, I quite antici pated a continuous flat plain for the remainder of the day. But the fact proved very contrary indeed. Instead of winding among the valleys of widely spread hills, like those round Langeac and Le Puy, the train threads an almost continuous mountain gorge by the side of the Allier, never losing sight of this river for long together. And they are such mountains ! Excepting for the absence of snow, the constantly varying views are quite Swiss in their character and beauty. Endur ing for a much longer space, it reminded me of the grand railway journey from Bale to Olten. I thought of our Midland Railway in its picturesque windings through Derbyshire, but felt that was indeed to compare small things with large. Plung ing incessantly from daylight into darkness, and from darkness emerging suddenly into light, as the train tore away to its destination, the effect was like alternately shutting one's eyes and opening them again on scenes of unusual grandeur, with a rapidity that was startling, and a variety which never ended. It is worth while travelling to Marseilles by this more westerly line of rails, if merely to see the tunnels, but the mass of travellers naturally take the directest and quickest line."], [81, "VII. TOWNS ON THE'. FRENCH 'LITTORAL.' i. Hyeres. The five principal health resorts on the French Littoral are well known : Hyeres, 13,000 inhabi tants ; Cannes, 14,000 ; Nice, 5S,ooo ; Monaco, 8,000 ; Mentone, or as our Gallic friends will call it Menton, 6,000. Hyeres can hardly be said to be on the Medi terranean, as it is three miles from that inland sea. It is a place intended to become of extensive proportions, and vast are the plans proposed and splendid the future promised for it. At present, with the exception of two or three of the hotels, there is hardly any building of importance in it, and the visitor suffers terribly from the bad drain age and imperfect sanitary arrangements. Its considerable population is principally packed in the narrow, tortuous, dirty, ill-ventilated, and not"], [82, "FLYING SOUTH. 70 at all drained streets of the old town, which is, however, better placed for warmth and protection from the mistral than most of the new residences at the west end. The east end is well sheltered. The question of drainage is now occupying the attention of the municipality. An inhabitant, how ever, protested to me that the refuse did very well, ' quand le soleil tappe dessus,' a speech which seems to prove that elementary sanitary education is still much needed. The natives are a good-look ing race \u2014 the men, indeed, often strikingly hand some. Hyeres is placed on the base of a remarkably steep rock ; the old castle crowning it is a pictur esque object : and the numerous walks around it affording views along the valley towards Toulon are exceedingly beautiful, comprising for their main features the mountains of Fenouillet, Coudon, and Faron, as also the smaller range of pine-clad mountains called Les Oiseaux, and Paradis, nearer the sea. The view from the summit of Fenouillet, where the cross stands, is very extensive and grand ; the entrance to the harbour of Toulon, the Maure mountains stretching away to the east, the Rade of Hyeres, and the lies d'Or, making a splendid panorama. From Coudon the view embraces a still larger area, and the top of that mountain can"], [83, "MYSTERIOUS PALACE. 71 be reached in a carriage. The lies d'Or, or Golden Islands, of Titan, le Levant, Porteros (hollow port), and Porquerolles (port for pottery), and the penin sula of Giens, are well worth visiting in fine weather ; but they are all rather beyond the reach of invalids, the approach to the peninsula being a sandy and stony causeway of three miles, and that to the islands by rough boats often having to con tend with boisterous weather. Coste-belle, half way between the town of Hyeres and the sea, is, as I before said, rapidly in creasing, and the inroads on the pine woods sur rounding it, threaten to diminish them sadly. A truly beautiful building called San Salvador, on the road to Carqueyranne, is nearly completed. It has been ten years in course of construction, and is so magnificent in its proportions and decorations, as to have caused much wonder regarding its destination and probable owner. Crowned heads have been named as likely to repose there ; but the prevailing impression now is that the present owner is getting it ready for a company, who are to open it to the public as a splendid place of entertainment, something of the nature of the Casino at Monte Carlo. The mystery will now soon be solved. The South of France is said to contain a good many Protestants, but the ' Temple ' belonging to"], [84, "72 FLYING SOUTH. them at Hyeres is very small, and when I attended it I counted forty-five or forty-six worshippers only, of whom some were English. It is scarcely more than a small lecture hall, and the only relief to its bare walls is a tablet 'to the memory of Sir Culling Eardley, \" the principal benefactor of this Chapel.\" ' The English Protestant Church, on the other hand, generally (in the season) has between 200 and 300 attendants, and the chaplain told me he considered the congregation under his charge to number quite 500. In June it is shut up, as the pastor leaves it, taking charge of a congregation in Switzerland. Of course this Church at Hyeres is ' supported by voluntary subscription,' and some courage is neces sary on the part of the chaplain, as he is personally responsible, by French law, to the Government, for all pecuniary liabilities, and for the proper conduct of the undertaking and congregation. The vast plain of Hyeres, stretching from the town to the sea, is one extensive market garden. The orange trees are disappearing, and the olive trees are about to follow their example ; for what pays best now is the cultivation of early fruit and vegetables, for Paris and other large towns, includ ing London. No doubt Hyeres is destined to increase and prosper, although, as it is off the main line of rail between Marseilles and the East, it will"], [85, "CANNES. 73 hardly in probability come up to its more rapidly extending rivals. It appears to be a convenient resting-place to people returning from Algiers. The visitors to it at present are mainly of the British nation, and a few Americans. The Germans hardly seem to patronize it, and the Russians do not go to it. 2. Cannes. Of Cannes and Nice, I must say broadly that I do not like the former place much, and Nice not at all. Cannes is an English sanatorium, visited by the upper ten thousand and the very wealthy of our nation, who change nothing when they go abroad but the climate. The foreign visitors to this place occupy more than 600 villas, and most of the 80 pensions and countless hotels. I was amused by a conversation between a French and a British lady. Said the former, by way of being agreeable, ' II y a beaucoup d'Anglais a Cannes ? ' Naively replied my countrywoman, ' Oh, mais il y a des Francais aussi ! ' Cannes is a marvellous producer of flowers, and supplies abundantly the scent manufactories in its neighbourhood and at Grasse. The groves of orange trees and enormous beds of roses are mainly cultivated for distillation. The large double scarlet"], [86, "FLYING SOUTH. 74 anemone is perhaps the most gorgeous of the spring wild flowers along the Riviera, though the more delicate single anemone is also to be found in rich profusion, especially between Cannes and Grasse, as well as wild tulips, narcissus, and star of Bethlehem, blue and white hyacinth, and a host more. Wherever English young ladies penetrate \u2014 and they are very indefatigable \u2014 these lovely flowers rapidly disappear, being rooted up without stint or mercy. Some they fortunately cannot utterly eradi cate \u2014 as the violet \u2014 which carpets whole acres with purple, and scents the air, though not so powerfully sweet as with us. Near Mentone, protected by the farmers, who exact a small fee for entering their grounds, the double scarlet anemone is so abundant as to be quite a sight worth a considerable exertion to see. Imagine a wild gorge in the hills, with a clear rapid stream remarkable when most of the mountain torrents are dry, and on the steep brink of this stream large groves of orange and lemon trees laden with fruit, under whose branches of brilliant golden green the scarlet anemones flourish by myriads. I calculated that I saw at least five or six acres in one place, quite covered with the dazz ling blossoms, which looked yet more exquisite where they broke loose from the cultivated ground, and grouped themselves among maiden-hair and"], [87, "CANNES. 75 other ferns just opening their new fronds on the rocky banks of the stream. No flower show of the rich and fashionable world could, I think, rival this natural display. One of the best situated and striking features of Cannes is the cemetery, which affords a grand view of the Alpes Maritimes, and contains, con spicuous amongst its various tombs and monuments, a gigantic cross to the memory of Lord Brougham. A bust of that nobleman is also erected in the ' Square Brougham,' on the pedestal of which is this inscription (not altogether intelligible) : \u2014 A Lord Brougham, Un magistrat francais Et les habitants de Cannes. There is, too, a full-length, life-size statue of him in the Grande Place near the Mairie and Esplanade, with a long Latin inscription, finishing with the quotation : ' Inveni portam \u2014 Spes et fortuna valete, ' Sat me lusistis \u2014 ludite nunc alios.' The view of the Esterel mountains enclosing the west side of the Bay on which Cannes is situated is very beautiful. The attractions of Cannes itself are to me difficult to discover, when so many other places along the Riviera invite. There are certainly beautiful excursions in the neighbourhood, but not"], [88, "76 FLYING SOUTH. very near at hand, and the place is every year more and more crowded with villas, which are gradually obliterating the country and destroying everything approaching to a rural walk. The large hotels are creeping higher up the hills to the north of the town, and the newest seems generally the largest and most sought after. Behind the monster hotel, Mont Fleury, there are still some wild and beautiful mountain paths, through the dense woods, affording every now and then very lovely views, towards the old town, the Esterels, and the Mediterranean. Persevering north-east, the pedestrian will reach a smooth and pleasant footpath along the side of an aqueduct, which conveys water to the town, and by its means he will arrive easily at ' California,' the favourite drive from Cannes. This serpentine road will take him back to the town, and the ramble is worth particularizing, as being about the only specimen of a real country walk still unspoiled. A pleasant excursion by steamboat or rail is that to Saint Raphael, at which little port Napoleon landed on his return from Egypt in 1799 ; and from whence also he embarked in 18 14 for Elba. Saint Raphael itself is a shabby little old town, but a quarter of a mile off, in the pine woods, has arisen a large modern hotel, which is attracting numerous visitors ; and in course of time Saint Raphael will"], [89, "CANNES. 77 probably become like so many existing resorts. Frejus is a mile and three-quarters distant, and should not be neglected, being a neat town of 2,800 inhabitants, with some fine old houses. One is con spicuous, having Caryatides supporting the door front, and was lately inhabited by the Juge de Paix. There is a good church, and a remarkable quantity of Roman remains, consisting of several arches of an aqueduct running more than twenty miles up the valley of the Ciagne ; a well-preserved, large amphi theatre, measuring 122 paces by 28 ; numerous bits of old wall ; and a fine old tower. Frejus is said to have been founded by Julius C\u00e6sar, and was called ' Forum Julii.' We inquired of the land lady of the hotel at which we dined how the population supported themselves. She said there was no business beyond a little work in the fields, and wound up with an apathetic declaration of ' Ceux qui sont riches sont riches, et ceux qui sont pauvres sont pauvres.' One of the regular drives from Cannes is to Vallauris, where are the large pottery works \u2014 inter esting, but not comely to behold. The village of Cannet, not much more than a mile from Cannes, is very pretty and picturesque ; and the view south from the platform near the old church, looking over the olive groves to the sea, is exceedingly beautiful."], [90, "78 FLYING SOUTH. Among the villas close at hand is that which the tragedian Rachel fitted up exquisitely, and in which she died. Grasse, twelve miles off, is finely situated, and a very ancient town, with a grand old church, and streets of the most picturesque description, with lofty houses built close to keep out the sun. The manufactories of perfumery do not appear so nume rous as the reputation of the place for that article leads one to expect. The greater part of the land in the neighbourhood is devoted to the cultivation of roses. I have spoken of the French Protestant Church at Hyeres ; here there are two with fair congregations. The large one in the Rue Notre Dame is attended by about one hundred and eighty persons, and is a good-sized, comfortable plain building : the appear ance of the congregation, tone of the service, and manner of the pastor, strongly resemble what is met with in an ordinary Dissenting chapel in the country in England. 3. Nice. Nice has grown out of all decent limits as a watering-place, and is now like Regent Street, Rotten Row, Brighton, the Broadway of New York, and the Boulevards of Paris rolled into one. It"], [91, "NICE. 79 seems very attractive to our American Cousins who, as well as the Russians, abound there. The imme diate neighbourhood presents grand features, and the view from the Castle Hill, where the grounds are charmingly laid out, is extensive and beautiful. The harbour of Villefranche is striking, picturesque, and convenient. But, speaking generally, the scenery as viewed from the town is much less inter esting than that of the two other places last named. The mountains are too far distant, and the inter vening plain does not charm the eye. The Corniche road to Mentone is, however, noble, and the snow range, seen almost all the ten miles to Turbia, form a superb semi-circle, embracing half the horizon. The picturesque little old town of Nizza, full of artistic bits, as in the Rue Paradis, is swallowed up in the modern monster, composed of large hotels, gigantic stucco houses, gay shops, and bright cafes \u2014 lavish expenditure proclaims itself on all sides. A long purse, and a power of enduring noise, rattle, and glitter, are requisites for the visitor at Nice. The sun is hot, the wind is cold ; when it blows from the east it rivals the British blasts from that quarter. A quiet retreat is not to be had for love or money. Grand receptions go on every day in the week during the season, among the rich private residents of all nations, and balls, theatrical representations,"], [92, "80 FLYING SOUTH. concerts, and gay amusements of every kind, prevail. One who gets into the privileged circle and hears the conversation \u2014 literary, political, and fashionable of the proper set \u2014 might fancy himself in Mayfair or the Faubourg St. Germain. But outside these brilliant salons, the eye everywhere meets very different features from those of the great centres of northern civilisation. Here all speaks of the ease-loving, sensuous South. Palm trees, pepper tree 5, the tall, and rather weedy-looking eucalyptus, and the philotaca, throwing in summer so welcome and dense a shade ; and amongst all this almost tropical foliage, houses gaily painted in fresco, with endless varieties of design ; and in the cloudless dome of sky such a sun shining down as causes every Venetian to be closed- \u2014 all this is in very striking contrast to the concentrated thrill of life and work in our English capital under its grey and solemn sky ; and even to the clear-cut splen dour and artistic finish of beautiful Paris itself. ' It is the sun that makes the climate,' remarked a health seeker from under the shade of his white umbrella ; ' and it is the sun that brings us all together, an heterogeneous assembly from every quarter of the globe.' And he pointed at the motley group crowding the Promenade des Anglais, as he spoke. Heterogeneous enough certainly ;"], [93, "PROFESSIONAL SWIMMER. 81 from the rather wild-looking Russian, side by side with the dreamy-eyed, dark-haired, supple, and graceful Italian, the loud-speaking, self-asserting German, the silent, supercilious John Bull, to the present lord of the soil, the vivacious Frenchman, and his elegant Parisian-dressed wife. Sauntering to and fro in such a mass as almost to prevent any easy progress, time seems to pass but wearily, and one cannot wonder that even any trifle is welcomed as a relief from their well-dressed monotony. The sea, rather rough in its mood, had dragged off an important beam of very heavy wood from a 'construction ' in progress on the beach\u2014pro bably some part of the intended work of covering over the unsightly mouth of the river Paillon. Im mediately a professional swimmer is summoned to the rescue : a slender stripling, admirably propor tioned, and delighted to show off his fine figure in his tight bathing costume. He does his work very gallantly ; but never for a moment, as you plainly perceive by every gesture, does he forget the crowd which stops to gaze on his prowess. From being ' oseur,' he became ' poseur,' and his attitude of self satisfaction, his eager acceptance of the murmurs of admiration bestowed upon him as he flung back his well-poised head, and shook the water from his hair, was truly charming to behold. I asked an old G"], [94, "82 FLYING SOUTH. Frenchman about him, and was not displeased at the tribute paid to my nation in the answer, 'that the swimmer was sure to be well paid for his gal lantry, as he had saved the property of an English company.' Carabacel was an environ, but is now a com ponent part of the town, which, with its white walls and dusty road, extends almost to Cimies, an environ about three miles from the centre of Nice. Cimies is a favourite spot for villas and orange gardens, and possesses the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre. The approach to it from Nice is rendered dreary by the high walls on each side of the road. The stony bed of the would-be river Paillon does not add to the attractions of Nice ; it contains generally but a trickle of water, just enough for the use of the washerwomen, who employ as a drying ground the rest of the rocky hollow where water should be. 4. Monaco. Monaco is a small Italian town of a few hun dred inhabitants \u2014 one square, one palace, and one street \u2014 all standing on the singularly bold promon tory so well known in history. In the square, the army of Prince Charles, composed of fifty men, are"], [95, "MONACO. 83 occasionally drilled, displaying a gorgeous uniform. The principality of Monaco, containing six square miles and 8,000 inhabitants, is really composed, like the globe, of four quarters, namely Monaco proper, Condamine on the low ground adjoining the sea, on the west side of the little inner bay, Moulins or Moline, with its brilliant villas on the slope of the mountain, east of the larger outer bay, and Monte Carlo. The last is the notorious and most attractive quarter \u2014 its Casino, built by Gamier, the architect of the Grand Opera at Paris, its gardens and pigeon-shooting ground, draw crowds of those staying in the principality, and many others from Nice and Mentone. Entrance to the unequalled concerts, which are given twice a day at half-past two and half-past eight, to the news room and to the gambling tables, is entirely free to the public, without any charge whatever. 'The poor gamblers pay for it all,' said an English groom standing on the steps of the Casino when I first visited it. The magnificence of the surrounding scenery, the un rivalled excellence of the music, and the hot excite ment of the gamblers surging round the tables, where mad play goes on from eleven in the morn ing till eleven at night, form together a scene not to be found elsewhere in the world. In the salles de feu exhausted players lie asleep on the benches, I. 2"], [96, "84 FLYING SOUTH. whilst the others, kept awake by their excitement, fling down, or rake up, the gold, or see it raked from them. One cannot listen to the perfect strains of harmony in the theatre adjoining, with out thinking of the sums which are being lost by enraged and perhaps ruined gamblers. Coming out of the concert, one meets faces which haunt the memory afterwards, and which contrast strangely with the glorious majesty of the neighbouring mountains in their calm grandeur, refreshing the eye and mind of those conscious of the scenes going on in the ' hell.' That used to be the name for such places, and Monte Carlo well deserves it. All the little town is flavoured with the atmosphere of money madness and passion for play. Some idea of the scale on which things are done by the ' Bank ' of the Casino, may be gained by the fact that the daily expenses during the sea-son are said to be 100,000 francs, or 4,000/., which would be at the rate of nearly a million and a half per annum sterling did the season continue all the year round. The late M. Blanc, who made a colossal fortune out of the gamblers, built a church at Monte Carlo at his own cost and charges. 'A strange world, my masters.' Looking back to my visits to Monte Carlo, it paints itself on my memory like a frightful night-"], [97, "MONTE CARLO. 85 mare, more frightful from its external splendour. Various figures which specially impressed them selves upon me flash in upon the Saturnalian picture. Leaving the Mentone station on the first morning of my exploration, I noticed with admiration a most elegant carriage, drawn by two fine grey horses, which seemed, as they flew along, to be proud of conveying a high-bred dame, as she certainly must have been, accompanied by a somewhat blase' youth, apparently her son. She gave her orders en prin cesse as she left her equipage for the train. I chanced to take my seat in the same compartment, and was struck with the perfect taste of every appointment in her costume. Face a la Marie Antoinette, figure tall and commanding, quite white hair, very abundant, and rising coronet-fashion over the brow in a manner, I think, only used by French women, but by them generally with admirable effect. A party of respectable, but not very polished Germans made up our freight. Marie Antoinette looked unutterable things at the man of the German party, who rudely bent across her and shut her window with a jerk, and without a syllable of apology, though he spoke French fluently enough. I am not capable of describing her toilette, enough that it was the perfection of rich colouring, faultless taste, and entire suitability to hour and season."], [98, "86 FLYING SOUTH. Having noticed this striking personage so closely, she immediately caught my eye, when some time later I was engrossed in watching the gamblers ; she entered one of the saloons alone, approached the roulette table, and threw down her stake. An hour later as, after my feast of music, I paid these halls of vice a final visit, there she was still, and this time her youthful companion was with her playing too ; her complexion, before ivory smooth and pale, was now flushed and fevered, so also the calm and haughty glance ; and when I saw her join the train to return to Mentone, the cheek was crimson still, and the expression altogether disturbed with the result of her day's occupation. There was one middle-aged man, whose demeanour was remarkable, as indicating a struggle between con science and a devil-inspired wish to play ; he made several convulsive movements to deposit on the ' tapis vert ' a small stake, lost it, and left the room. 'A foolish mild man, an honest man, look you, and soon dashed.' Perhaps he knew and acted on the sentiment of ' Le bruit est pour le fat, la plainte est pour le sot, L'honnete homme trompe s'en va, et ne dit mot.' The remembrance of a delicate-looking, lovely girl, too, comes before me, arrayed in soft folds of drapery. Her face was not flushed, but wore a"], [99, "MONTE CARLO. 87 sweet expression, although utterly engrossed. Thus she sat among a number of men, all strangers to her, appearing, whenever I passed that way, to be calmly resolved to spend her day in her unholy pursuit. At the same table were two quite elderly women, decently dressed in a rather shabby genteel style, grey-haired, grey complexioned, and ghastly in their absorption. One of these I afterwards saw on the terrace of the garden outside, cramponnee \u2014 I cannot find an English synonym to the iron rail \u2014 with her head and face buried in her arms. Men's faces too, heated and intense, rise in plenty to my memory ; but they seem, however revolting, less out of place, \u2014 to our shame as men be it spoken \u2014 in such a scene as I am trying to describe. Asking information half an hour later of a respectable couple, man and wife, who were taking their even ing stroll on the fine esplanade, they answered all my inquiries with the usual politeness of their nation ; the good woman winding up all by saying, \u25a0 C'est un pays de fifes, mais il y a bien des diables la haut,' indicating the grand maison de feu, which towered above our heads. 5. Mentone. ' De gustibus non est disputandum ' applies here as everywhere. 'Don't stop at Mentone. C'est"], [100, "88 FLYING SOUTH. un petit trou etouffe,' said a lady to me with serious earnestness. I think it the most attractive of the five places I have mentioned. The scenery is both grand and beautiful, the walks lovely and exceed ingly numerous, though the drives are limited on account of the close neighbourhood of the moun tains : the old town is picturesque and visible everywhere around, running down to the edge of the sea ; the natives are Italian in appearance and language. From Cape Martin, which makes the southerly point of the western bay, you behold on the one side Monte Carlo, Monaco, and the Mountain Turbia, and the distant Esterelles ; on the other side the two bays of Mentone, with their shield of mountains, at the foot of which lie in the distance and upon the blue sea Ventimiglia and Bordighera. And yet beautiful as are these views, they do not give an adequate idea of the magnifi cence of the scenes disclosed in the drive by the carriage road from Nice to Ventimiglia, the finest part of the Corniche. Oh the railways have much to answer for! Among their sins is the whirling people through such scenery, of which but little can be seen from the level of the line. Speedy and cheap transport are the virtues of the rail ; for the man of business or for him whose occasions demand quick travelling it is a great boon, but for"], [101, "MENTONE. 89 the lover of fine scenery it is tantalizing ; madly rushing on and giving its rider no ' leave to breathe awhile.' And here in the sunny south, where the ' dolce far niente ' is the beau-ideal, swift travelling seems out of character. The invalid should surely have as little as possible of it if he wishes to cheat the ' dark mother always gliding near with soft feet.' Mentone has not yet been quite spoilt by English villas, though they are increasing every year. But the mountains will prevent the great expansion which has taken place at Cannes and Nice. 'Tis a choice spot, though perhaps a trifle warm ; still it takes some time to thaw a Britisher. Even in winter the natives are not driven to resort to the stables for warmth, as is the custom with the peasants of North Italy, when the women take their work and the men their pipes and songs into the cow-houses for heat and shelter. The main street of the town contains good shops with a dash of Paris in them, and there is sufficient ani mation and gaiety of scene without the noisy bustle of larger places. The French Protestants are in greater force at Cannes and Mentone than at Hyeres. Though the population of Mentone is less than half that of Hyeres, the Protestants number more than three"], [102, "FLYING SOUTH. 90 times those of the latter place, the congregation attending being over 200, and the chapel well appointed and rather handsome. Still of course the Anglo-Saxon Protestants, who have as many as three churches in this small place, show a larger aggregate attendance. The distinct enunciation of the French preachers is very remarkable ; every syllable is clearly and carefully pronounced, whilst in our pulpits much is lost generally inconsequence of indistinct utterance and dropping of the voice at the end of sentences. At Mentone the Russians are in great force, and announcements on the walls are seen in the Russian language. At least one Russian news paper is to be had in the cafes, and the language is spoken in some of the shops. The great number of old towns close to Mentone formerly or still existing is very remark able, owing to the small principalities which in former times flourished here. One of these is Old Castellare, now nothing but a ruin, grandly perched on craggy rocks more than 2,000 feet above the sea, and standing all alone, with no habitation nearer than the existing village of Castellare, about three miles distant below. Other towns, like Castiglione, still exist in a half-ruined state, with a population miserably poor ; and though frugal"], [103, "NEAR MENTONE 91 and hard-working, reaping but scanty result from their strenuous endeavours. The industry with which the mountain sides are everywhere cultivated, with but small promise of reward \u2014 laboriously made terraces being supported by stone walls, and every terrace having solid stone steps to reach it \u2014 is wonderful. There are strongly- built houses of refuge on the mountains for temporary use during the summer out-of-doors work, and these have the marks of insurance companies, so that they are held of value enough to be secured against fire. Every spot where vegetation will exist is sedulously dug and planted, for hand to mouth existence, and not with any view to a market. One sees tidily dressed women plucking handfuls of grass from the roadside for their cattle, and some spots on the mountain sides, not much larger than a full-sized pocket-handkerchief, are expected to contribute their modicum of grain, which will in due time be turned into a few mouthfuls of very black bread. High up on almost perpendicular rocks a few lean kine are discovered here and there in the care of a gaunt herdsman ; they browse a little, but are mainly fed within the walls of the rough habitations. On asking how the human inmates warmed their dwellings in winter, I received the answer, ' We do not warm them, the fuel would"], [104, "FLYING SOUTH. 92 cost more than our scant food.' As the natural products of the soil are merely olives, oranges, and lemons, and a few flowers for essences, the natives have a hard time of it. In Mentone almost all provisions, and nearly everything in the way of food, or of material for food for the numerous visitors, are brought from a distance : the beef from Italy, the sheep from Algiers, the corn from Marseilles, the vegetables from Hyeres. The in habitants of the town of the poorer class, contrary to the sentiment of the majority of mankind, rejoice in the winter as compared with the summer, because of the influx of visitors, whose wants and luxuries cause a flow of money. The drivers of car riages and donkeys then reap a good harvest ; when summer comes they get rid of their horses as use less, and put their donkeys on such agricultural work as can be found, while they themselves turn masons, bricklayers, fishermen, or keep indoors and go to sleep. One of them said to me very coolly that if he did not earn some money in the winter he could not live in the summer, and should be driven to ' steal or assassinate like the others.' This man had been in the French army nearly seven years ; he was, he said, forced to enter it against his will, having drawn 'a bad number,' and was glad to leave it after having been"], [105, "CASTIGLIONE. 93 in 1870 engaged in the affairs of Gravelotte and St. Privat, then shut up in Metz, and afterwards a prisoner at Mayence and in Silesia. His know ledge of what went on in the first-named battle was very small, as, he said, from half-past eight in the morning till seven or eight in the evening he had to lie flat on the ground, the fight being mainly one of artillery ; at St. Privat there was more moving about, and he had had to fix bayonets, but nothing more. He was glad to have his liberty again, but found it hard to keep a wife and two children. In my rambles about Mentone I learnt that the olives are dug round about the roots at least once in two years, the old portions removed, and air and space introduced ; but what seemed incre dible until verified by ocular observation is that rags of old clothes are applied with the manure to the roots. If fed with manure alone, the tree is apt to make wood instead of fruit, whereas the slowly decaying rags check the too rapid supply of nutriment. Castiglione is a fair specimen of many old towns hereabouts of the same type. Constructed on a rock 2,000 feet above the sea, and originally founded by the Moors, it has always been called upon to act as sentinel and outpost in the various"], [106, "FLYING SOUTH. 94 wars of which this part of the country has been the theatre \u2014 it still has its high walls with their loop holes, towers, and bastions. Its streets are narrow and winding, the houses lofty, and in some instances originating in the rock itself; pillars crowned with capitals have inscriptions purporting to be of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. And round the strange old town are mountains varying from 4,000 feet to 6,000 feet above the sea, which seem to form an interminable and insurmountable barrier to invaders, who were nevertheless periodically drawn to it by the desire of conquest or plunder. Nothing can be more impressive in their way than these solitary towns crowning the weird-looking rocks ; and the effect is not diminished when you enter them, and see here and there a woman at her door feeding a splendid donkey as large as a small horse, out of one of the picturesque and classical looking glazed pans used for cooking in this district ; or through the arched passages communi cating from one street to another, or under the arch of a gloomy staircase, catch a glimpse of a cloaked male figure, half hidden in the shadow, and suggesting the proximity of the Italian frontier, hardly a mile to the east. The dresses of the women are often most striking for colour. I noted one as follows : red and light brown handkerchief"], [107, "ISOLATED TOWNS. 95 round the neck, chocolate-coloured bodice, grey blue upper skirt, caught up and showing pink lining, rich green underskirt, and crimson stockings. All is full of interest to the denizen of our crowded cities, with their dense populations dressed alike in neutral tints. In every village you find a large ' place' or square, often without a living being in it. One cannot help speculating on the lives of the inhabitants of these secluded places, which are for the most part unapproachable by a carriage of any sort. The only direct road between Castiglione and Mentone, ten or twelve years ago, was a mountain path solely available for pedestrians and donkeys or mules ; carriages of all sorts had to go round by Nice. This road or path is now entirely out of repair, and difficult to pass along at all, so that the natives are absolutely isolated in their scattered dwellings. The cure is the one person who seems to keep the little society together ; he is known to everyone, and says mass, and christens, and marries, and buries. ' Here all know the cure', said a peasant, ' whilst down there in Mentone there arc five or six priests who know none of us, and never speak to any one.' The little churches often have inscriptions, such as the following, which struck me as unjust to the glorious scenery all round : \u2014 ' Que le ciel est beau, et la terre mesquine.'"], [108, "96 FLYING SOUTH. These country cure's are quiet-looking men, with a dash of the farmer in them. There is as great a difference between the various kinds of ecclesiastics as exists in any other class. I came across a very extraordinary specimen of a priest in 1872, while waiting for my train at the railway station at Avignon. A stout, imposing-looking dignitary of the Roman Church entered the salle d'attente. He was clothed entirely in white robes, white hat lined with violet silk, and looped up with a violet cord, and was followed and obsequiously waited on by a humble-looking abbe' in black, tall, and of imposing physique. The former, I ascer- tained, was a Bishop of the Dominican Order. His attendant, the abbe, accosted me in excellent English, but with American accent ; and after a/ew generalities as to the superiority of French railway travelling over English, he launched out into serious abuse of England, said she ' ought to be hanged ' for not having assisted the Southern States to become an independent nation, declared himself a strong confederate, and stated emphatically that ' Palmerston ' would have helped the South had not Prince Albert on his deathbed made the Queen promise to oppose the South, because the Prince of Wales had been hissed at Richmond, Virginia !

The last-named has a passion play on the 5th of August in every year, of the same nature but not of the same quality as the famous one in the Tyrolean Ammergau. They have, since the French annexation, lost their Italian names of Castellare, Castiglione, San Agnese, and Rocca bruna. They are destined to gradual ex tinction, railroads and modern carriage roads leaving them in their solitude, and they are no longer worth repair. The conditions of the country are entirely changing, as population and easy com munication increase in the more modern cities. Beautiful as the Riviera is, drawbacks exist affecting a residence there, the principal and main one being the absence of sanitary arrangements as to drainage already alluded to. All the towns on the French Riviera are poisoned by this great defect, and the odours consequent on the bad drainage are absolutely at times overpowering, and must be more or less injurious. ii"], [110, "FLYING SOUTH. 98 Another objection is the very trying effect of the rapid transition from hot to cold, rendering great care absolutely imperative. It is hardly too much to say that one requires more extra clothing in the warm South than in our colder North.

The confirmed invalid, under the constant care of doctor, nurse, or friend, runs less risk than the visitor who comes to amuse or enjoy himself, and thinks he may act as in higher latitudes.

O Primavera, gioventu dell' anno, Bella madre di fiori, D'erbe novelle, e di novelli amori Tu tomi ben, ma teco Non mai tornano i sereni E fortunati di delle mie gioje.' Spring has returned. The swallows, human and winged, are flying northward, and it is la bas, la bas once more.

So we decide upon seeking once more the white cliffs of Albion.

At Pau one cannot stay long in May, but to me it would be agreeable at all times \u2014 the quaint, quiet old town, perched on its bank, and commanding the Pyrenees, is charming, and attracts me much. But one begins to long for fresher air, and that is found in perfection at Biarritz, which appears to me the healthiest of all the sanitary refuges in the South of France, with a magnificent ocean horizon, and gorgeous effects on the rolling Atlantic. When looking at the sea one turns one's back on the gigantic hotels, which murder all romance. The near neighbourhood of Spain is felt at Biarritz \u2014 one sees and hears, as at Pau, the goat herd piping to his goats when he drives them into the town to be milked, and everyone admires the mild-eyed oxen drawing heavy waggons with so much dignity. Spanish costumes meet the eye, and it is but a drive to the Bidassoa, after crossing which you are in Spain ; and at Irun and Fontarabia see architecture and people of a type new and striking. The Basque churches in particular are dif ferent from any I ever saw elsewhere \u2014 vast, gloomy,"], [113, "ARCACHON. 101 gaudily decorated ; bare floors, with no pews or enclosures, and strange wooden galleries along the sides two to three storeys high. San Sebastian is clean and not uninteresting, but it has not many features to announce its Spanish origin and nation ality. Bayonne, which is only twenty minutes from Biarritz by its special railway, is a charming town, broken up by the Adour and the Nive, which meet there, and become one fine stream under the former name, flowing into the Atlantic. Pursuing our homeward course, we give a little time to Arcachon, which is delightful and with quite a character of its own ; displaying fantastic ornamental villas of various sizes and patterns, some with a ground floor only and no upper room \u2014 most of them sheltered by the pine forests, others looking on to the curious salt lake, which is supplied by the neighbouring Atlantic. The vast oyster cultivation is the staple industry of the place, which is a most favourite resort of visitors, very many coming from Spain for a cooler climate. Leaving Arcachon, and passing through Bordeaux and Paris, we are soon in London. But before we quit ' la belle France,' let us have a serious word about our pleasant neighbour and her present state and prospects. The great mass of the French people seem"], [114, "102 FLYING SOUTH. satisfied with their existing government, and they are at this moment so prosperous that the idea of change appears not to be desired or desirable. The conflicts between the Senate and the Chamber do not at present amount to more than healthy friction. The existing republic has now lasted longer than any previous republic in France, and its difficulties have been enormous, in consequence of the heavy burthens, pecuniary and other, bequeathed to it by the last Imperial ruler ; the fearfully heavy expense of extravagant armaments supposed to be inevitable in the actual condition of Europe ; the embarrass ment of dealing with ecclesiastical matters in the prevailing temper of the people ; and a certain jealousy more felt than openly expressed by the other European powers. On the whole, the present form of government suits the people, who inherit many of the ideas of 1789, and are imbued with the principles of modern democracy. They have seen three monarchies perish, and have learnt by expe rience the fatal consequences of political crises. The great body of the French peasants are the most thrifty, industrious, and security-loving in Europe ; and as time goes on and education spreads, these peaceable qualities will become more and more deeply rooted, and the provinces be no longer led by the excitable theorists of the large towns. The"], [115, "THE FRENCH OF TO-DAY. 103 French are becoming well aware that their role is no longer that of the most military nation, and that it is unwise to rush into war because gloire rhymes with victoire. The provincials desire to be left quiet, to work and hoard. They are, as is well known, most passionately devoted to the idea of being possessors of a little land, and those who cannot become so, invest in the funds or Govern ment loans. Probably no other people exist amongst whom so large a majority have a stake in the country, and are so strongly interested in the maintenance of order. Another reason which may prevent their encouraging a hope of successful struggle, with their old enemy to the east of the Rhine, is, that the population in France is decreas ing, whilst in Germany it is steadily increasing, not withstanding emigration. France hopes no doubt to extend her territory and her numbers along the north coast of Africa. The smaller agriculturists have after all a hard time of it. The whole family are, as a rule, engaged in the cultivation of their property, and, if numerous, can only exist by strict economy and a marvellous industry ; indeed, in such cases the children are some of them compelled to accept service with neighbouring farmers. In the South the metayer system of hiring still prevails to a certain extent,"], [116, "FLYING SOUTH. 104 and the landlord gets the worst of it, as the tenant finds many ways of obtaining for himself the larger part of the profits. The French are extraordinarily attached to their home, and their old ways and habits, and seldom get tempted to change the scene. They are not a travelling people, and are very con servative in many ways ; but despite their love of the soil, emigration of the surplus population is becom ing less uncommon, particularly from the south western corner of France. These emigrants do not often find their way to the United States, but, like the Italians who leave their land, most frequently select a South American state ; and those of them who cannot bear expatriation, seek employment in the larger towns of their native land. The emi gration movement is a recent one, and has grown out of greater geographical knowledge, and the increased facilities for moving from an old country to another. Till lately, the French peasants of the centre of France hardly knew there was any other country than their own. As they increase their knowledge of other lands, we may fairly hope that their growing love of peace will also increase, and the desire for aggressive war disappear. There are not, perhaps, many observers who will deny that the unfortunate war of 1870 and 1 87 1 was probably entered on very much in the"], [117, "FRENCH OF TO-DAY. 105 hope of securing the Imperial throne for the youth whose tragical death was such an undreamt of catastrophe. It does not seem likely that France will again be tempted to venture on such risk for a similar cause, and it is to be hoped that every Frenchman will before long wish, as I sincerely believe every Englishman already does, that in future ' never war advance ' His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.' It is, however, hardly safe yet to discuss old grievances or causes of quarrel, and an incautious word will sometimes offend unreasonably ; for Frenchmen will ' fret over a phrase,' although they may not be ' tortured by a sigh,' or ' subdued by a tear.' They are pre-eminently susceptible, and cherish their title of ' la grande nation.' It is most difficult, perhaps hardly proper, to speak of the religious faith or the practice of reli gion in any, but especially in a foreign country. The subject, however, is too serious to be passed over without any allusion to it. I should say that there is now in France both more and less religion than there was forty years ago. People are more markedly divided into two classes : one very ear nestly professing the faith, and strict in observance of the exercises, directed by the magnificent old 1"], [118, "106 FLYING SOUTH. church, which has roots so deep and far-stretching ; the other casting off creeds, dogmas, and ceremo nies, and acknowledging no church. These contrasts are probably the result of greater thought being given to the subject now, whereas indifference, or a hollow outward submission to the priest, formerly prevailed. I suppose an impartial and truthful investigator would, however, be driven to pronounce that the French are not a religious people. In bidding farewell for the moment to the French I must remark that since I first knew any thing of them I have always felt convinced that they make life brighter than we or the Germans do ; and that is much in this work-a-day world. Their enjoyment of existence and savoir vivre do the stranger good ; and one quits their sunny skies and sociable companionship with regret. An occa sional visit to them refreshes much, and enables one to return to serious duties with renewed power and zest, so that on coming back to necessary work, even a vestry meeting can be gone through with relish. And the remembrance is very delight ful of all the beautiful scenes so much enjoyed abroad, and of all the courteous attentions received.
