It was like a soothing opiate to spend five minutes in the estimable society of Mynheer Kalm. In the course of business, men of excite able temperaments sometimes called upon him and with hasty words and impatient gestures tried to arouse bim to a sense of their importance, but in vain. The eagerness of these gentlemen was thrown back upon themselves like cannon-balls striking the armour-clad sides of a man-of-war and falling ignominously into the sea. In fact, Mynheer Kalm's ideas moved so slowly that vehemence of any kind was simply incom- 1 vol. i."], [10, "2 LOST FOOTSTEPS. prehensible to him. Deep in the mysteries of ledger and cash book, or poring over the money market column of the \"Rotterdam Daily Journal,\" he was as insensible to a new comer as a well-fed porker in his stye is to the buzzing of an officious fly alighting on the tip of his ear. If the stranger was of too impetuous a nature to modify his rapid utterance, the chances were that he never got speech of Mynheer Kalm at all. If taught by experience he condescended to use a few simple and very direct words, with a lapse of some seconds between each, there was just a possibility that he might gain some attention in the course of time, but even then, though the audience might last an hour it was doubtful if he wrenched half a dozen words from that reluctant _ tongue. Mynheer had never been known to wink, but in moments of hilarity or great excitement had been seen to nod and even to shake his head. His special characteristics had become so well known in Rotterdam, that many of his dealings were conducted upon what we may call the"], [11, "3 INTRODUCES A DUTCHMAN. nod and shake principle. The system is not without its advantages, and may be commended to some of our great city companies just now as a means of preventing a great deal of squabbling, and not a few falsehoods. It might even, if adopted, serve as a check to that unpleasant reaction which so often follows ill judged fluency in commercial matters. The business operations of Mynheer Kalm were transacted at a wharf in Rotterdam, and consisted mainly in purchases of timber rafts floated down from the provinces of the Upper Rhine. However large these dealings might be Mynheer Kalm was never excited by them. Some men would have hurried and scolded \u2014 would have marched baokward and forward \u2014 stamped, shouted, slammed doors, and opened drawers to find nothing in them \u2014 would have made memoranda, and forgotten them the next moment \u2014 would have given orders only to countermand them, and have asked for a dozen references from different folios in a breath : but Mynheer Kalm knew better."], [12, "LOST FOOTSTEPS. Whether he adopted one of the maxims of the great Napoleon, that half the affairs of life righted themselves if you only gave them time, I cannot say ; but of this I may speak with the utmost confidence, that no matter how cranes might rattle, or wheels rumble, no matter how loudly carmen shouted, or boatmen swore, Mynheer never was moved from his colossal calm. He rose sedately in the morning, in dulged in a few steady whiffs from his huge meerschaum by way of clearing his brain from the weighty matters deposited there on the previous day : then, if the morning was fine and the season propitious, he walked once round his choicest bed of tulips, tenderly removing any dead leaf or faded blossom, and then came in to breakfast. Two huge cups of coffee having trickled slowly down that capacious throat, the clock struck nine, and he donned a hat of a fashion unknown to the present gene ration, and after a walk of about three-quarters of a mile, which occupied him precisely half an-hour, he reached the wharf and found the"], [13, "INTRODUCES A DUTCHMAN. 5 morning paper nicely aired, and opened at the money column by his faithful manager and factotum, Kloots, lying upon his desk. Sometimes he read letters at the office, but more frequently carried them home with him, when, having dined, taken his forty winks and his meerschaum, with a gentle reviver in the shape of Schiedam, he would, if in fine weather, peruse them in his favourite summer-house overhanging the canal. By the time his labours had concluded it was perhaps dusk, and as Mynheer kept no company, frequented no theatres, belonged to no clubs, and indeed was not in any way what poor Artemus Ward would have called \" a festive cuss,\" he was ready for bed. On some special holidays it is true the manager, Kloots, was invited to spend an evening with his master, and this singular pair kept high festival in the summer-house till a later hour. Kloots, who was sufficiently loquacious, talked then enough for both, while his master listened with good-humoured tolera-"], [14, "6 LOST FOOTSTEPS. tion, unless indeed he happened to sleep through the discourse, in which case Kloots amused himself as best he could, winking at the domestic who waited upon them, till the de mure little round-faced maiden had the greatest difficulty in keeping a countenance of sufficient gravity to suit such a household as that of Mynheer Kalm. Kloots was deficient too in the sublime com posure of his master, and every additional glass told upon him, so that it was a matter of some difficulty at times for him to reach his lodgings at the wharf without scandalizing the neighbours. But if the evening's amuse ment would not always bear the morning's reflection, Kloots never failed at his post, and always retained his master's favour. At least once in the month Mynheer in three words enquired after his health, and sometimes without any comment added a little present to his salary which Kloots received without remark, so well did he understand the lofty serenity of his employer."], [15, "7 INTRODUCES A DUTCHMAN. As may be readily imagined, the taciturn character of Mynheer did not attract to him a batch of frivolous acquaintances, and his oircle of friends was also exceedingly small. There was a certain Mynheer Vanderbeck who did an excellent stroke of business with Japan, and whose garden joined. Between these gen tlemen a familiarity had been first established upon the mutual ground of tulips, and as Mynheer Vanderbeck had confessed himself fairly outbloomed, so to speak, by his neighbour, a warm friendship had been cemented. For it will be within the experience of most readers that a hearty friendship rarely sub sists between perfect equals. There must be a superiority on one side or the other. Mynheer Vanderbeck having admitted the superiority of his neighbour's tulips, they were congenial spirits from that hour. Mynheer had one other friend who usually visited him yearly \u2014 an Englishman. And it happened on a breezy spring morning that this Englishman, whose name was Joyce, who had"], [16, "8 LOST FOOTSTEPS. been a solicitor in extensive practice, but had made a handsome fortune and now spent his time and money in collecting pictures \u2014 it hap pened that this Englishman having saluted Kloots in the outer office with the familiarity of an old acquaintance, was standing in the doorway of the private counting-house waiting patiently till Mynheer perceived him. It was a very long time before he did so, but the Englishman, with a pleasant smile upon his face, did not shout or grow impatient. He was a man of about fifty years of age, with that keen, inteUigent expression \u2014 frosty, yet kindly: frank, but slightly sarcastic \u2014 which is so often seen upon the face of an English lawyer of good standing. A man quite prepared by habit and experience for the oddest variety of character, he did not seem astonished, or in the slightest degree annoyed when Mynheer calmly closing a ledger whioh he had studied for three hours without moving a muscle, looked up, and seeing his visitor, honoured him with a scarcely perceptible nod, pointed to a"], [17, "9 INTRODUCES A DUTCHMAN. chair and rang the office bell for Kloots, without uttering a sound. Kloots came speedily, and opening the door of a strong room plentifully studded with bolts and bars, deposited therein the book over whioh his master had meditated so deeply, and gave him the key, when Mynheer slowly putting his arm in that of his friend led the way from the wharf to his private residence. A year had passed since Mr. Joyce's previous visit to Holland, but he asked Myn heer no questions. As they walked along he amused himself with the various peculiarities of life in Rotterdam, but said nothing. There was none of the buoyancy or sadness, the mirth or gloom, with which friends usually meet after a year's absence. Mr. Joyce knew, however, that when Mynheer had dined, and taken his nap and his meerschaum, that he would be an attentive listener, and until then he contented himself with his own reflections. Their only companion at the dinner table was Mynheer Kalm's only child, a beautiful"], [18, "10 LOST FOOTSTEPS. girl eight years of age, and of whom the father, notwithstanding his remarkable taciturnity, seemed doatingly fond. The little maiden, though he said not a word to her, climbed over his chair and pulled him about during the entire meal, and when she became so trouble some that Mr. Joyce, out of sheer charity as he thought, invited her to his side of the table, a faint smile played for a moment upon the stolid visage of Mynheer, and he gently shook his head unwilling to part with her. The mother of this petted child had been Mr. Joyce's sister. Years before, the lawyer had a case to conduct which required him to hunt up certain documents in Holland, and occasioned his stay there for some consid erable time. By way of recreation he invited his only sister, who kept house for him, to pay a visit to Rotterdam. There they became acquainted with the worthy merchant. How Mynheer could ever have popped the question, or in what manner he could have displayed sufficient emotion to tempt a young"], [19, "11 INTRODUCES A DUTCHMAN. and good-looking English girl to marry him, must ever remain an insoluble mystery. Certain it is that Miss Joyce became, to her brother's great wonderment, the wife of Mynheer. Her married Hfe was of short duration ; her delicate constitution suffered from the fogs and frosts of the rigorous climate, and she died in two years after her marriage, leaving one daughter, the little Louise, who had been teasing her father at the dinner table. Mr. Joyce was upon the best possible terms with his brother-in-law, and often tried to persuade him to pay a visit to England, but no inducement that he could offer was strong enough to tempt Mynheer from his beloved Rotterdam. Mr. Joyce's home was in Surrey, in a beautiful district at the foot of Leith Hill, and he often expatiated upon the beauties of Enghsh landscape scenery, but his Dutch relative had not the slightest appreciation of the beauties of nature. He had never in his life seen a hill so lofty as the steeples of Rotter dam, and when Mr. Joyce described a summer"], [20, "12 LOST FOOTSTEPS. excursion he had spent in the Alps, Mynheer shuddered at the toil and danger encountered in those sublime solitudes. That people should risk their lives and sacri fice their personal comfort in the mere pursuit of natural beauty, seemed to him the most whimsical and unprofitable fancy that could possess humanity. How much more sensible to walk at their ease upon nice green meadows as level as their own drawing-room floor; or, if they wanted active exercise in winter, what better than a quiet skate twenty miles down a peaceful canal ?"], [21, "CHAPTER II. Mr. Joyce's Adventure. Dinner over, Mynheer refreshed after his nap, and the little girl coaxed with some difficulty into the nursery, Mr. Joyce said : \" I have had an adventure, Mynheer, during my voyage from England.\" We should have stated that Mynheer was perfectly acquainted with our language, his knowledge having been increased through marrying an English wife. It must be honestly recorded that the word \"adventure\" did not awaken any great enthusiasm in his mind, but he gently nodded his head and listened. \" Our steamer was barely clear of the Thames,\" continued Mr. Joyce, \"when my attention was drawn to two of the passengers on deck, a woman, and a boy about nine or"], [22, "14 LOST FOOTSTEPS. ten years old. I should hardly have noticed them perhaps, had I not observed the boy \u2014 an inteUigent looking httle fellow, with beautiful features and very bright eyes \u2014 busy sketching with a piece of chalk upon the deck, the out lines of a ship with aU her canvas set, standing out to sea. \" The mere outUne which he had drawn in two or three minutes was so vigorous and truthful that I was dehghted with it, and asked him several questions which he answered without stopping from his work, or even looking at me. When the sketch was finished, two or three other passengers came forward, expressing their surprise and gratification, and the young artist, seeing himself an object of interest and curiosity, became shy and reserved. \" Both the lad and his mother, as they appeared to be, were very poorly clad. I gave him a shilling to leave the sketch as it was, but a heavy, driving rain came on and the lines were quickly obliterated. The boy looked a httle sad as he saw his design gradually"], [23, "mr.

Finding the rain coming on faster, I went below, telling the lad he had better advise his mother to do likewise. \"However, after remaining some time below, as the boy and his mother did not appear, I became curious about them. \" The attitude in which I left the woman sitting had deeply impressed me. She sat with her arm leaning on the bulwarks of the vessel looking far away to sea, with an anxious, fixed, almost despairing gaze, never once turning round"], [24, "16 LOST FOOTSTEPS. or taking any notice of the passengers or the boy at her side. It could not have been any thing in the prospect that interested her, for the sea was misty and the sky dull, while the drizzUng rain made the atmosphere denser each moment. Evidently she was suffering some grievous mental anxiety or disappointment. \" When I came up on deck again she was stiU sitting in the same position. I called to the boy, and gave him a trifle for the sake of conversing with him. I found him very inteUi gent and quick. I was about to ask him some question, when there suddenly arose a cry of alarm from a passenger near me, and looking up, I saw the woman in the act of leaping overboard. \" To have jumped in myself would have been madness, for I never could swim two yards in my life. I, however, gave an immediate alarm, and the vessel was stopped and a boat lowered. The passengers hurried up on deck, and every body made some suggestion or other, and were anxious to be of use, but aU efforts proved"], [25, "mr. Joyce's adventure. 17 useless : we never saw the poor creature any more. She had probably been carried under the vessel by the surge of the paddles, and if she rose to the suface at aU it must have been at a considerable distance from the vessel. \" The piteous look of the poor boy I shall never forget as long as I live, nor the passionate sobs with which he implored, first one, and then another of the passengers, to leap into the sea in search of the poor woman. Many of the seamen would willingly have done so had they known in what direction she sank. \" It was evident she had committed suicide with the greatest determination, and had chosen the time when there was least likely to be a chance of rescue. For more than an hour the boat was kept rowing about the ship, and at last the order was sorrowfuUy given for the steamer to go on. \" The despair of the lad touched me keenly, and I brought him with me to Rotterdam, thinking, Mynheer, that you might possibly find vol. i. 2"], [26, "18 LOST FOOTSTEPS. some employment for him, or advise me what to do with him.\" Mynheer Kalm sat looking straight before him for some minutes after Mr. Joyce had concluded. It was evident that he was affected in his own peculiar way, but in his secret heart he had a positive horror of boys. They were too sudden in their movements, and too noisy for him to cope with. Once he had taken into his office a lad related to Kloots, on the promise that the manager would look sharply after him; but the young gentleman proved so unruly that he was more than a match for master and man. He made kites of Mynheer's sacred daUy paper, shied the office ruler at unlucky sparrows, and ended by dropping it into the canal. He tempted smaller boys upon the huge crane, and then turned it warily and left them suspended over the water in mortal terror. He chalked his hands and left impres sions thereof upon the saintly black overcoat of his master. He dashed mysteriously from obscure corners when Mynheer came to the"], [27, "19 mr. Joyce's adventure. wharf, and once overthrew that worthy gentle man in his own counting-house. He cried so readUy, promised amendment so earnestly, and forgot his good resolutions so speedUy, that Kloots was completely at his wits' end what to do with him, and at last privately bribed the young incapable not to appear at the wharf again. It was with a Uvely recollection of the agonies endured from this enterprising youth, that Mynheer \u2014 rising sedately from his easy chair \u2014 put some money in Mr. Joyce's hand, and speaking for the first time for nearly three hours, said solemnly \"No boys!\" Mr. Joyce rejected the money with a smUe, and seeing his brother-in-law's alarm upon the subject of boys, said no more. He had lodged the forlorn lad at the hotel during his stay, and behaved to him with the greatest kindness. Mr. Joyce seldom visited Holland without purchasing some pictures, and upon this occasion"], [28, "20 LOST FOOTSTEPS. he had been particularly struck with a copy made by a young artist, of \" The Woman taken in Adultery,\" by Rubens. He had sent his purchase to the hotel, and having one day visited his young protege\" he was surprised to find the lad standing before the picture, lost in admiration. It was a beautiful work; the head of the Saviour being a grand combination of personal beauty, lofty feeling, and inteUectual power. The varied expressions of the Pharisee and Sadducee were wonderfully given also. One could see in the face of the former the calm disdain and self-righteous horror with which the man of the world regarded the clemency of the Saviour, while the caUous nature of the Sadducee was unmistakable. The voluptuous figure of the woman herself was especiaUy suited to the genius of Rubens, and the copyist had done his work weU. \" You seem to like my picture, young shaver,\" said Mr. Joyce, breaking in upon the lad suddenly."], [29, "mr.

Mr. Joyce is Astonished, There could hardly be a loveUer day than that upon which Mr. Joyce, with his young charge, arrived at his pretty viUa at the foot of Leith Hill. The morning was the perfec tion of stiUness. It was nearly the end of AprU, and the weather was just warm enough to make the open air enjoyable, whUe the freshness of the air gave a zest which is often wanting at a later season.

When they got to the top a slight wind cleared away the mist almost instantaneously, and then the view that met their gaze might weU cause Adrian to break forth into an exclamation of delight. a Looking over twelve oounties and a space of nearly two hundred miles, with hills in the distance rising one beyond another, till only a purple haze revealed where the landscape ended; clothed with luxurious woodlands and verdant fields, with here the roof of a princely mansion, and there the tiny spire of an antique church, with fern and heather kneedeep at their feet, and a soft sky glowing above their heads, it was not without much seU-gratulation that Mr. Joyce pointed out his pleasant viUa nest- Ung in the shadow of a fir plantation upon a rising ground at a Uttle distance. \" 0, how happy you must be, sir,\" exclaimed the boy ; \" I'm sure if I lived in a house like that I eould become the finest painter in England.\" ' \" You don't know yet, my lad, what work"], [32, "24 LOST FOOTSTEPS. you would have to do to become the first painter in England. I can assure you there is something else required than merely looking at fine scenery. But let us get home, for I am tired and hungry.\" When they had finished an early dinner, Mr. Joyce said : \" Now, young shaver, you must teU me something of your past Use, that I may consider what is to be done with you. Have you no friends anywhere ? \" The mention of friends, and the remembrance of his mother's untimely end, brought tears into the boy's eyes, but he soon recovered, and said with every appearance of sincerity, \" I've no friends, sir, now. There was father and my sister CecUy, but I don't know where they are.\" \" How did your father Uve ? \" \" He was a showman and kept a van with a giant and a dwarf, and some snakes and a panorama.

She was very unhappy, I think, and one day she took me away and we wandered about the city tUl it was dark, and then got on board the steamer near the Tower. I don't think she cared where we went or what became of us.\" \"But you must have known where you lived,\" said Mr. Joyce : \" Supposing I went to town with you, could you not find out the spot ?\" \" Father never stayed many days in a place, but travelled over the country, and I think, sir, something was wrong, for the poUce often watched him.\" \" You must have had a hard time of it.\" \" Very, indeed, sir ; sometimes when mother had been drinking too much, and father was away, we had nothing to eat.

Oh, if I could but hear her now ! \" The lawyer was a man of the world, and had done some hard things in his time. When he issued a writ against a shuffler it was in vain to expect much indulgence at his hands, yet many a London charity was the better yearly for Mr- Joyce's cheque, and he had often stepped between hardhearted creditors and unfortunate debtors. When he saw how deeply the lad was moved he patted him upon the back and told him not to despair, for they would be sure to find Cecily again some day. \" And how did you learn to draw so well ? \" enquired the lawyer. \"There was a man at one place where we lodged chalked upon the pavement for a Uving. He could do a ship in a storm splendidly, or the moon rising behind a church tower, with some Uttle clouds in the sky, and he would draw a mouse nibbling a bit of cheese as natural as life.\" \" And where did this distinguished professor exercise his talent ? \""], [35, "27 MR. JOYCE IS ASTONISHED. \" 0, anywhere that he could find a broad pavement with plenty of foot-passengers, but I'm afraid, sir, he told a great many lies.\" \" I don't doubt that,\" said Mr. Joyce, laughing, \"but how did you find that out ?\" \" He mostly began close to the waU in very big letters, ' I am unable to work through an accident at sea,' then a little lower down, underneath a drawing of a salmon, he would put 'poverty is no crime,' and sometimes it would be \u2014 ' i\" have not broken my fast to day,' when I had seen him eat a good shoe of bacon, and drink a great bason of coffee at his breakfast, and if he hadn't eaten anything, it was not for the want of money, for he generaUy got half-a-dozen coppers by the time he had finished the moonUght scene.\" \" Earned more than many a young exhibitor in the Royal Academy wUl this season, I'll be bound.

In a Uttle time I could guess the size of a jug or box exactly, and then I tried dogs and horses. We lodged then at St. John's Wood, and I used to stand for hours on the bridge over the canal, trying to make a pioture of the barges.\" \" By Jove, young fellow, you've been taught in a better school than half our landscape painters, who seem to fancy that patches of colour, and in distinct outhne, wiU make up for their incorrect drawing.

Mr. Joyce had gone into the organ-loft expecting to find his friend there, and left the youth looking at the monuments and painted windows. Noticing a singularly abstracted look in his face when he returned, he enquired the cause of it. \" I am trying, sir, to remember where I have seen a church Uke this. It must be a long time ago, but I feel sure I have been in a church Uke this before ; I seem to remember some one laughing because I put my arms round one of the carved figures, thinking it was a large doll and cried be cause I could not carry it away with me.\" Mr. Joyce laughed at the idea, and leaving the church they went to the curate's house. Two pretty girls had seen him in the church yard, and came running down to the garden gate to welcome him. \" I've brought you something from HoUand, Maude,\" said Mr. Joyce, \"and I have not forgotten Alice either. Now teU me where's papa ? \""], [38, "30 LOST FOOTSTEPS. The curate was in the garden and thither ran the girls foUowed by Mr. Joyce. Adrian, left to himseU, wandered into the house and sat down quite bewUdered. A strange feeUng possessed him that the place had been famiUar to him as a child. Supposing this to be so, it could not, at his present age, have been many years back, for he was not yet ten years old, but to the imagination of a boy at his age, a few years seems as remote perhaps as half a century is to the tottering old man who re calls the events of his early life. A host of in distinct images had been kindled into life by the carven figures he had seen in the church aisle. The laughter caused by his attempt to embrace it echoed again in his ears. What foUy it is to imagine that the events of chUdhood are of no importance \u2014 that the lights and shadows which flit before the childish fancy are so evanescent as not to colour the after-Use. It is a grave question whether a man's whole career is not generally influenced by the apparently trivial occurences of his childhood. It was an old-fashioned country house in which"], [39, "MR. JOYCE IS ASTONISHED. 31 Adrian sat, and it seemed to him curiously famiUar. We frequently notice when we visit any spot after a long interval how rapidly the same ideas that passed through our minds in the by gone days are revived.

Every article in the room had some suggestion of its own to remind him of the past, and from material objects his fancy wandered to the two girls who had greeted Mr. Joyce at the garden gate. Surely it must have been with two girls he had played when a chUd, and one of them tossed her baU through yonder diamond casement. Full of the idea Adrian rose and actuaUy put his finger upon the glass, as though expecting to find it still broken, and the next moment smUed at himseU, convinced that he was mistaken altogether. His vague impressions were, however, to be soon"], [40, "32 LOST FOOTSTEPS. put to a more rigorous test. The room in which he sat, did not command a view of the garden, but soon a distant murmur of voices graduaUy approaching nearer, told him that Mr. Joyce had found his friend, and that they were coming into the house. The conversation had evidently been about him self, for as the gentlemen neared the house it dropped to a whisper, and Adrian, even if he had been inclined to play the eavesdropper, could not have distinguished a syUable. A moment more and Mr. Joyce entered \u2014 then his friend.

The girls had gone out with Adrian for a stroU, and the curate was alone with his housekeeper, Mrs. Crankley. Accustomed for some years to the reverend gentleman's quiet habits, and having the utmost esteem for the sainthness of his office, she never interrupted him. At length Mr. Hope broke the sUence himself. \" Do you know, Mrs. Crankley, I am getting a Uttle uneasy about Adrian ? \" \" Indeed, sir ; why ? \" \"lam afraid, ma'am, we shaU not keep him much longer ; the boy gets restless and impatient,"], [45, "37 HOME LIFE.

This was in reference to his brother Martin. Some inkUng of the truth had crept out in the vUlage, though repressed out of affection for the clergyman. It was known, and perhaps to a"], [51, "43 HOME LIFE. greater extent than Mr. Hope was aware of, that his brother had rendered himself amenable to the law and had suffered an imprisonment, after which he had gone to Australia. Adrian still remained in profound ignorance of all this, and with his two cousins, Maude and AUce, was very happy. Maude, the eldest, was a merry Uvely girl, full of mischief, and leading poor Mrs. Crankley such a Use that the good lady was often led to declare that \" such doings would not have been tolerated in her young days.\" She was brimfull of tricks, and was much encouraged therein by Mr. Joyce, who constantly offended the worthy housekeeper also, by his free and easy notions upon the subject of rehgion. Long and frequent were the discussions held between the lawyer and the curate, until both of them were quite exoited by their own argu ments, pro and con., the amusing part of which was, that after each had started in the most extreme opposition to the other, they generally managed to agree most heartUy before they parted. If occasionaUy the extreme views of the"], [52, "44 LOST FOOTSTEPS. lawyer passed Mr. Hope's view of toleration upon religious topics, a slight coolness was caused for a day or two ; but a genial note from Mr. Joyce, usuaUy accompanied with a present for the girls, set matters straight again, and Mr. Hope fully beUeved that he, and not his neighbour, had been the offending party. The temperament of AUce was altogether of a quieter kind than that of Maude. She was as sweet-tempered and genial a girl as ever was born. When Maude, who deUghted to put Adrian in a passion, by spoiling his drawings, would even draw her finger across any choice sketch in water colour, Alice was generaUy the peacemaker. Maude was quick, keen, joyous, and passionate : Alioe, calm and serene as an October afternoon. Maude would learnanything with the slightest possible effort, and forget it entirely on the morrow ; but AUce, slower, was deeper, and what entered her mind was fixed there.

I think I saw him near Gabriel's miU as I came along : let us go and take him by surprise.\" Adrian was reaUy at the spot Mr. Joyce referred to, trying at that moment to make a sketch of it in water colours. He had chosen a pleasant time for his task. It was a quiet, serene morning, the gentle babbUng of the miU-stream alone breaking the sUence. Dark wUlows bent over the stream, and covered it with a mysterious but transparent shadow. Lower down the stream widened a Uttle, and a clear open pool reflected the gorgeously tinted clouds, and the taU bulrushes on the banks nodding their velvety heads to the Ught breeze that wandered through the vaUey, and brought to the ear the echoes of tinkling sheep beUs upon the neighbouring downs.

The youth looked up eagerly, flushed with enthusiasm. \" Oh, yes, uncle, I am quite confident of that. I have been sitting here aU the morning, but I can't finish the sketch for I have no more water colours.\" \" Here, run into the town and get some,\" said Mr. Joyce, handing him half-a-crown. \" ReaUy, my dear sir, you will spoil him, you will indeed.\" \" Nonsense, it's worth ten times the money to VOL. i. 4"], [58, "50 LOST FOOTSTEPS. see his enthusiasm. We old fogies have lost that pleasure ourselves.\" So the two friends continued their walk, and Adrian fetching some colours, remained at the miU nearly the whole day At breakfast-time the following morning, Mr. Hope was amused to see the children glancing furtively at a sketch which Adrian, whenever he thought his uncle was looking, hid under the table. This piqued Mr. Hope's curiosity, and he asked to see Adrian's achievement. Adrian brought it round diffidently to his uncle's chair, and a thrill of gratified vanity passed through his breast when he saw an unmistakable expression of surprise upon his uncle's face. \" You have done this alone, Adrian ? \" \" Yes, uncle, I tried so hard, you can't think, not to omit anything.

Yet I think he wiU be obliged to allow it has some merit. Run over to Mr. Joyce, Adrian, and take the girls for a walk with you, and ask him to give me a call.\" The errand was however rendered unnecessary, for the curate's friend was at that moment coming up the garden path, upon which, Adrian having considerable doubt as to his patron's opinion being so favourable as that of his uncle, hurried out of the room, leaving the picture to stand on its own merits. Mrs. Crankley followed the visitor into the"], [60, "52 LOST FOOTSTEPS. room, and could hardly beUeve her eyes when told who had painted the sketch. Much as she depre ciated his performances upon the ceiUng, she made fuU compensation now in warm praise. But Mr. Joyce held the picture in different lights, and sniffed, and winked, as only your true connoisseur knows how, putting it down at length with a sUght shrug of the shoulders. In fact there was just enough promise in what Adrian had done to make Mr. Joyce a Uttle afraid of the encouragement he had given. He had mixed a good deal with artists, and knew also how captivating their Use appears to the novice. He had seen youths of moderate abihties puffed up by their mistaken friends untU they believed them selves capable of anything, and were painfully deceived at last by out-spoken critics. No praise can be tco great for the amateur who cultivates art from genuine love of it, but it is the wildest folly to adopt it as a profession unless possessed of striking individual powers. Such was the substance of the lecture Mr. Joyce delivered when he saw how seriously his"], [61, "Adrian's first studio. 53 friend had taken up the idea of art as a profession. \" However,\" he concluded, \" we shaU soon see if Adrian has the requisite faculty and perse verance, and U so, I have a friend who will put him in the right way. Let him try what he can do by himself for a time.\" So Adrian began to paint in earnest ; his first studio being an empty hayloft. Mrs. Crankley was immoveable on this point \u2014 that he should not study indoors. In vain did our hero protest that he would make no dirt or confusion in the house ; that he would in future respect clean walls and drawing room paper hangings. The marks of his former sins were stUl there to testffy against him ; and the worthy dame was inexorable. His carpentering skUl was called into request to construct a rough skylight, and a ladder to ascend the hayloft, and he was as proud of his labour as though he had been a Brunei or a Stephenson. Mr. Joyce came frequently and looked at his work, and he soon became famiUar with the tech-"], [62, "54 LOST FOOTSTEPS. nicalities of art. Indoors Mr. Hope listened with an amused smUe to his anecdotes of great painters, how Giotto had been a poor shepherd-boy ; Turner, the son of a hairdresser, and other simUar instances of men rising from obscurity to fame. FuU of enthusiasm, he was yet subject to fre quent fits of despondency, when he became disgusted with his work, and lost aU beUef in his own powers. Quick in temper, and somewhat caustic to outsiders, he had the warmest feeUng and widest sympathy for those of whose affection he felt assured. He had a quaint fancy and a fund of grotesque humour, abundantly shown in some caricatures of his uncle's parishioners, but this was a branch of art Mr. Joyce did not much encourage. \" Nothing createi enemies, Adrian, sooner than iU-timed ridicule : people are generally but too conscious of their own shortcomings, which, if they cannot hide, induces them to claim at least the indulgence of faUible mortals like them selves,\" said the lawyer, who, with Alice, was looking at Adrian's latest work, and detected"], [63, "Adrian's first studio. 55 these grotesque whimsicaUties upon the table beside him. \" You have got on beautUuUy, Adrian,\" said Alice, \" I have not been near you for several days because I wanted to judge better what advance you had made.\" \" Perhaps it was as well you stayed away, dear, for you would have often seen me perplexed and annoyed with my frequent faUures.\" \" You must not mind that, Adrian,\" said Mr. Joyce, \" young artists are very apt to imagine in advance of their executive powers.\" \" Why should you be so anxious, Adrian, if you do not succeed at once?\" remarked his cousin, \" I suppose you wiU at least be able to earn a living by art, if you cannot become a great painter ? \" \" Pooh ! AUce, do you think I wish to be a mere copyist and imitator ? Besides, I want this sketch to be good, so that I can show it to the celebrated London artist, Mr. Joyce's friend.\" \" Now do you leave off grumbling, my young"], [64, "56 LOST FOOTSTEPS. friend. AU the great artists I know talk very little, and by Jove the critics, the connoisseurs, the picture dealers, and others won't give them much chance, for they of course are supposed to know better what the artist intended than he does himseU.

His deputy, however, still kept up the solemn warning, \" be in time,\" and Adrian went with the girls into the caravan. They were treated to a panorama which turned upon rollers, and which must have moved with prodigious swiftness to display fifteen thousand miles of American scenery in five minutes. Then"], [75, "67 THE REVEL. there was an exhibition of a learned pig, who when asked to point out the greatest dunce in the room, deposited a capital D at Adrian's feet, causing his cousins to laugh merrily, and himself to feel just a httle confused. The man who had been vociferating outside now entered the caravan and played a lively dance tune on the violin. After a few bars there bounded from behind a curtain at the back of the van a girl dressed in the costume of a theatrical fairy, who began dancing most gracefully. Her figure was light, her move ments easy, her attitudes extremely picturesque. She was evidently very young, though in the dim light of the caravan it was not easy to dis tinguish her features. Bending forward in one of the movements of the dance her face almost touched that of Adrian, who then for the first time recognised her. There could be no mis taking that beautiful figure and expression of face. It was Cecily ! There was a fascination in every movement of this lovely girl which visibly influenced"], [76, "68 LOST FOOTSTEPS. even the rough uncultivated audience of the caravan. To Adrian her graceful attitudes re called an exquisite figure in one of the paintings belonging to Mr. Joyce. He was so deeply moved that he forgot the time, place, and scene, and only remembered the happy days they had spent together. The dance she had performed finished the entertainment, and Adrian, aroused from his reverie, remembered that he must speak to her at once if at all. Taking advantage of the bustle made by the crowd hurrying towards the door, he stepped forward, took her hand, and said in a low tone\u2014 \" Cecily, don't you remember Adrian ? \" Perhaps he was altered the most, or it might be his different costume, but for an instant she did not recognise him. Then suddenly bound ing forward and kissing him, she said delightedly, \" My dear boy, forgive me, but you looked such a gentleman.\" \"And you the loveliest little fairy that ever was seen, yet I knew you, Cecily.\""], [77, "69 THE REVEL. \" Hush,\" she said in a whisper, \" I dare not speak to you here \u2014 Wolfe has been so violent when your name was mentioned, and has for bidden me to speak to you.\" \" Then see me at dusk, dear, at the back of the caravan. I can come behind the shows and not be seen, I have so much to say to you.\" \" Yes, Adrian dear, don't stay now please, father will be here in an instant to see what money we have taken.\" Adrian had been separated from his- cousins for a moment by the crowd, but when Maude saw Cecily kissing him she was not a httle astonished \u2014 besides being a trifle jealous. She did not imagine there could be anything wrong in the act, but when they walked back and found Adrian very silent and thoughtful, she began to rally hhn. \" Adrian is wonderfully quiet, is he not Ahce ? I do beheve he has been fascinated by that pretty dancing girl.\" \" Perhaps so, Maude, she was enough to fasci nate Adrian or anybody else. What expressive eyes, what lovely hair, and transparent skin ; and"], [78, "70 LOST FOOTSTEPS. such a figure, why a Princess might be proud of it !\" \" Perhaps she is a highborn beauty, who knows ? who has been stolen by the gipsies when she was a child like the httle girl in that tale we read yesterday. I'm sure there must be a romance about her.\" \" I Avish you would hold your tongue, Maude,\" said Adrian in a pet. \" That is the very girl I have so often talked to you about.\" \" What, Cecily ? Never ! \" oried both the girls in a breath. \" It is indeed, and I am afraid poor thing she is not happy or weU treated. I have promised to meet her this evening, and mean to bring her home and hear what Uncle Percival can do. She shah not follow this hateful life any longer if I can help it.\" Full of this idea, into which the girls entered most heartily, they reached home, but were disappointed to find their uncle had been caUed to the death-bed of a parishioner. There was no help for it, and Adrian waited with what"], [79, "71 THE REVEL. patience he could command till dusk, and then went back to the Revel. He reached the spot agreed upon with Cecily, but it was some time before she appeared. When she came at last it was evident that she was in great terror lest her absence should be discovered, and fancying some one called her, would have hastened back to the caravan. This Adrian, however, would not permit, but insisted on taking her back with him. He pictured in gloAving colours the kindness he had experienced and the warm reception she would be certain to obtain, and finally she was per suaded to accompany him. Hastily putting on an old shawl and a hat very much the worse for wear, this innocent couple threaded their way between the lumber and confusion in the rear of the hne of shows, Adrian feeling almost hke a knight of chivalry resouing some fair distressed damsel from ruth less enemies, and Cecily picking her way as lightly as though the very echo of her footsteps would bring immediate discovery."], [80, "72 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Once clear of the Revel and in the open fields, she was more like her old self, and in her childish joyous happiness, she recaUed every moment some memory of their former life, which made them both laugh merrily. The sun went down with a blaze of light over Leith HiU as they neared the cottage, and Cecily, almost as keenly alive as Adrian himself to natural beauty, said \u2014 ' \" Look, Adrian, how glorious ! What a beautiful world it would be if people didn't spoil it. How happy you must be to spend your hfe in such a place. But, Adrian dear,\" and her voice dropped suddenly to a whisper, \"you have not told me if mother is vrith you. Father is in a passion if her name is men tioned, and says he never wishes to see her any more.\" \"He Avill have his Avish then, for she will never see him any more on this earth.\" He then, while poor Cecily's tears feU fast, described as tenderly as he could what had taken place, glossing over the poor deluded"], [81, "73 THE REVEL. woman's failings, and bidding Cecily not be despondent. \" Adrian, it is quite dark,\" cried she suddenly, \" do let me go back at once and I wiU try and see you in the morning and teU you what town we shall go to next.\" \" I shan't let you go, Cecily,\" said Adrian firmly, \" here is my uncle's house, and when he comes home we will hear what he advises. I know he wiU invite you to stay with us always.\" \" But father wiU be so angry, dear, when he finds me away, and perhaps beat me. He does sometimes when he has been drinking.\" \" My uncle will see all about it, Cecily, don't be afraid, but come in with me.\" The poor girl, much alarmed, aUowed Adrian to lead her into the house, where Maude and Alice welcomed her most warmly.

Adrian had so often extolled the beauty ami cleverness of Cecily that Maude and Alice fel( at home with her at once. As to the poor danger, the society of cultivated girls of her own age was quite a revelation to her. All the gay spontaneity of her nature was speedily revealed under this sunny influence. She told them the lunniest anecdotes of her Bohemian life, showed them conjuring tricks, imitated the characters she met with amongst the show people, sang all the songa she had learned with Adrian wheu they where children together, while Alice, who was a far better musician than Maude, accompanied her delightedly on the piano, and Adrian brought out his violin. They told her over and over again that Adrian had not praised her singing half enough, for the simplest ballad moved them as they had uever been moved before.

The van was lighted up earlier than usual, for CecUy's performance had been so popular in the morning, that it was intended for her to begin the entertainment in the evening. Wolfe had been a httle suspicious latterly of CecUy. She had shown an unwUlingness to perform frequently. She was becoming daily more womanly in appearance too, and the coarse louts who frequented the country fairs occasionaUy discussed her budding charms (which WoHe insisted upon her displaying rather hberaUy), in language that made her cheeks burn with indignation and shame.

When Mr. Hope came home, he was surprised"], [84, "76 LOST FOOTSTEPS. to see a man looking through the casement of his little parlour. Coming nearer, the shadow of the intruder became more distinct, being thrown into strong relief by the light of the lamp inside. It was a form the clergyman had seen once before, but then under circumstances which stamped its image indelibly upon his memory. In all his previous life Percival Hope had never felt such a rush of stormy passion as he did then. The memory of a woman's honour blasted, and her child only rescued from a vicious life through the sympathy of a bene volent stranger, fiUed him with such a desire for vengeance that for the first time in his hfe he hated that sacred calling which taught him that \" vengeance is the Lord's.\" Seen but once while Avith his brother in swift pursuit, there was yet an individuality in the man that made his face and person easy to re member. Rushing swiftly up the garden path the curate seized him by the ooUar, and caUed loudly for assistance."], [85, "77 THE REVEL. His voice brought the httle party out of the house in a moment. But Wolfe was not a man to be taken by surprise. He recovered his self-possession instantly, and shook off his assaUant with such force that he fell heavily to the ground. Adrian ran to his uncle's assistance, for he had been stunned by the fall. Taking advan tage of the confusion, Wolfe seized Cecily roughly and disappeared. Mr. Hope was some hours before he recovered from Wolfe's attack, and it was too late to go in search of CecUy. If they had done so it would have availed them nothing, for within an hour or two every stick of Wolfe's show had vanished."], [86, "CHAPTER VII. PROFESSOR UZELLI. Adrian deeply grieved over the failure of his plan regarding CecUy, yet persevered manfully at the studies Mr. Joyce recommended, and made a very creditable advance. The connoisseur watched him with interest, and lent him valuable pictures to copy, amusing Adrian very often by the running comments he made upon their styles or subjects. \" The re's nothing in the world hke varnish Adrian,\" said that gentleman one day, as they stood contemplating an extremely smoky ' old master.' \" Varnish is a wonderfully successful ingredient anywhere.

Then, if you make a fool of yourself, your uncle and cousins wUl be none the worse for it.\" Accordingly the very next day Adrian, who had not slept a wink over night from excitement,"], [89, "81 PROFESSOR UZELLI. went with Mr. Joyce to London, and waited in the ante-room of the celebrated artist till it suited his convenience or caprice to see them. That Professor UzeUi was a capricious man, his warmest admirers could not deny. But though they laughed at him for his outre man ners, and questioned many of his artistic theories, he was considered one of the best and was certainly one of the severest professors of the day. He attempted great things, taking for his subjects incidents from Shakespeare \u2014 Paradise Lost\u2014 the Cain and Manfred of Byron \u2014 Goethe's Faust, and such imaginative works. In some instances he was very successful, but in others it was felt that the subtle, impalpable idea which is so often understood by suggestion only in fine poetry, escaped altogether in the realistic attempt to place it upon oanvas. Still, with all his failures admitted, he was a remarkable man, and Adrian was struck dumb with astonishment and pleasure at the rough out lines and sketches carelessly scattered about the ante-room. After some time the professor entered VOL. I. t>"], [90, "82 LOST FOOTSTEPS. and invited them into his studio, and Adrian was startled to behold a man the very reverse of every idea he had conjured up respecting him and his Avorks. All the young enthusiast's high-flown notions of the ideal life of a painter were scattered in an instant, for it must be confessed that the professor was decidedly unblushingly dirty \u2014 that he smelt ferociously of tobacco \u2014 that the brown holland blouse he wore instead of being the neatly fitting dazzlingly-clean article of costume usually depicted in pictures of artist Use, was full of holes, and the material hardly to be recognised for the many daubs of paint upon it. An old piece of rope instead of a belt did not add either to the elegance of the professor's costume. And not only the man, but the place, was dirty, dusty, unbrushed, unscrubbed, disarranged \u2014 tne very pictures and sketches tumbled about \u2014 some of them of rare excellence, and only requiring a httle pains to make them really A-aluable \u2014 were thrown into odd corners as though the painter had an utter contempt for everything"], [91, "PROFESSOR UZELLI. 83 that fell short of the standard he had set up for it. Adrian was almost pained to see that an anti chivalrous lay-figure of a Crusader had given the Goddess of Love an ugly blow with his sword, while a grim Puritan frowned defiance on a charming fortune-teUer \u2014 a ruddy Bacchus handed an overflowing cup to Luther and Me lancthon as they sat translating the Bible \u2014 a blind Belisarius held his cap to Quentin Matsy's miser, and a clown grinned through a horse-collar at the preaching of St. Paul at Athens. This jumble of incongruities, however, was less displeasing than the general want of comfort and order everywhere conspicuous. This disappointment was modified in some degree by the noble expression of the professor's face. Spite of dirt and untidiness Adrian saAv in the quick flashing eye, the bold contour of the features, the full, heavy brows, and the wide expanse of the head in the region where phrenologists have placed the ideal and reflective organs, that Uzelli was no common man."], [92, "84 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Mr. Joyce was upon intimate terms with the professor, who received him warmly, and enquired his errand. They talked for some time in an undertone about Adrian, and at length Mr. Joyce said \" I want to see a wUd young nephew of mine, Adrian, who is staying in the Temple, and I will leave you to show the Professor what you have done.\" Uzelli addressed his future pupU in a comical accent \u2014 half French, half German \u2014 which made Adrian smile at first, though the professor prided himself that his command of Enghsh was perfect : \" And zo, young master, you vill be von arteest, eh ? \" \" I hope so, sir.\" \" Vat viU you paint, eh ?

I'm told those pictures always seU well, but I don't wish to paint in that style: it seems so homely and common place.\" A faint smile played round the professor's lips. He was used to this 6ort of thing, as every young pupil generaUy began with a horror of every-day Use and reality, and wished to produce something imaginative, something ideal. In fact, not to mince the matter, unlike anything in heaven or earth, or the waters under the earth. The professor gave vent to a prolonged \" ah ! \""], [94, "86 LOST FOOTSTEPS. accompanied by an expressive shake of the head, and questioned Adrian a httle more. \" Vat do you say to de marine iriew ?

Adrian, however, thought it must be \" High Art,\" and nothing less, that was likely to suit him. Uzelli laughed, and said \" Show me vat you have done ? \" Adrian opened in a flurry a portfolio he had brought with him at a place he had not intended. Instead of a scene of Mythological Lore, in which a great number of nymphs and satyrs disported themselves, and which he intended should astonish the professor (as doubtless it might have done, but not in the way Adrian expected), there appeared nothing but a rude sketch of some tumblers he had seen performing at the Revel. He was about to put this hastUy aside and display his grand studies, but Uzelli caught hold of it, and held it whUe he examined the classical group with some impatience, after which, holding up the despised sketch to the light, he said \" Dat is de best you have done ; ze attitude is bold and free, and ze drawing not so bad.

Adrian begged to be aUowed to watch him at work tiU Mr. Joyce came back, and was witness to some curious freaks on the part of his future master. UzeUi quoted, in his broken Enghsh, scenes from Shakespeare, MUton, and Byron, mingled with passages from the Bible, with a keen appreciation of their value to him as an artist, but, perhaps, nothing deeper, for a muttered oath frequently clenched a scriptural extract, when some stroke which he had intended to produce a great effeot, saUed."], [97, "89 PROFESSOR UZELLI. On the whole, when Mr. Joyce came back and asked his opinion of the professor, after they had left the house, Adrian hardly knew what to say."], [98, "CHAPTER VIIL Ambition. Adrian estabhshed himseU in London, Uving modestly, and working hard. Upon one point only did Mr. Joyce distrust his young protege. He feared that Adrian, impetuous as he was' would too hastUy expect results from his labour, which could only be the reward of years of toil, and he had estimated Adrian's character pretty accurately. Some months had passed in the pursuit of his art, and he had begun to acquire a fair command of the pencil, and Mr. Joyce was surprised when he called one day, to find him boldly attempting a scene from Faust, which he purposed, when completed, to send to an exhibition. Mr. Joyce shook his head. \"There is a Avide field for you there, my boy, and considering that"], [99, "91 AMBITION. every painter, poet, and musician has been fas cinated by that astonishing work, I don't wonder at your being infatuated.

The higher the aim, the greater disgust you wUl feel, if you fail. There is a very foolish notion in some very foolish minds, that men of genius achieve their triumphs Avith little labour, by the mere force of inborn aptitude or inspiration. This fallacy has ruined many a young artist.

Whatever sublime dream he indulges in, he loses no opportunity of applying the means necessary to the end. \" The , true artist should be capable of feeling and embodying the loftiest mood of the mind, but he should be also quick to detect the adaptabUity of things ; for genius, with all its creative power, has but a limited vision after aU. It can, at best, recreate in forms, which have the appearance of novelty, what has been and wUl be, while the world lasts. The man of genius need not for that be a mere imitator. It wUl be his highest province to give some suggestions beyond what he has actuaUy fixed upon the canvas, and that is what, I fear, Adrian, you have not yet the power to do; and therefore I would say, take a lower stand till you are more certain of your resources.\" UzeUi caUed while they were speaking, and looked keenly at the work; then, with an expressive shrug, smUed, and invited Mr. Joyce"], [101, "93 AMBITION. to dine with him, telling Adrian there would be some of his pupils there in the afternoon, and, if he would call, he might go the round of several exhibitions. We have hastily indicated the stages of Adrian's advance, but in reality he had now been studying many months. He had made several student friends, who, if they laughed at his impetuous and ardent temper, sym pathised with his earnestness, and admired his evident abUity. \" Well, now, my dear Uzelli,\" said Mr. Joyce, when they reached the professor's house, \" what have you to say as to the future of our young student?\" \" Vat can I say of ze future ven de vorld is noting but change and confusion? Fashion is changing every day and art is ze same. Last year de people buy only pigs and puppies ; dis year dey cry for grapes, peaches, and pineapples. Years ago people say ideality was ze sing.

He may lofe art still wizout painting a picture or composing an opera.\" This was the only opinion Uzelli would give. In fact, he did not like giving opinions, and the conversation turned into other channels. In the afternoon, Adrian and two or three young students dropped in, and Uzelli carried them off to a gallery where he exhibited a couple of pictures. Uzelli was apt in such visitations to indulge in very caustic sallies upon the works of artists wheat theories of painting he disliked, and to a certain ulass of students he showed no mercy whatever. A young student named Edie was one of the party. He was a great favourite with Adrian on account of his lively disposition, but his pro ductions did not promise him any great name i 11 the artistic worlds \" It will be jolly, Adrian, to go with Uzelli to day, you will see,\" said the student m an under-"], [103, "95 AMBITION. tone. \" He AviU cut up some of them to-day in slashing style.\" Some allowance was to be made for the professor. He had certainly not received the encouragement that was his due. He had a fine conception of poetical subjects, but indulged in strange extra vagancies of colouring. Very often an almost supernatural hue would be imparted to an ordinary subject and excite the ridicule of his brother artists, while the same effect in such a scene as the witches in \" Macbeth\" would have delighted them. It was the greatest amusement for Edie to hear a running fire of the professor's comments upon the various works as they passed through a gallery. \" Ha, Uzelli ! \" said a coxcomb, as they entered the exhibition ; \" how de do. Been looking at your study from ' Paradise Lost.' By George, you have' almost made me understand MUton at last!\" \" Mine Got ! I shall be canonized as a saint ! \" \"How so, Uzelli?\" asked the astonished con noisseur."], [104, "96 LOST FOOTSTEPS. \" By vat you say I have performed a miracle, for I have made you understand a great poet.\" They stopped before a subject from \" Homer,\" which the professor praised, being especiaUy fond of the Greek poets. Then they came to a picture by Edie, who muttered to Adrian \" that he was certain to be in for it he knew.\" The subject was \" Judith,\" and Edie inquired how the professor liked it. The professor ohuckled ominously. \" Ha, ha! I know de model. Dere is a leetle maiden at ze ham and beef shop ; ven she lift up her knife to cut a slice off de beef I shaU say, Dere is Edie's 'Judith.'\" Edie was downright angry ; for he saw at once the truth of the comparison, having unconsciously copied the girl. \" You vU not study de antique,\" said Uzelh, \" and dis is de result. You must see beautiful forms all ze day before you can produoe beauty.\" A portly-looking picture-dealer now saluted him. Perhaps his well-fed appearance roused the"], [105, "AMBITION 97 professor's ire, for in answer to an invitation he repUed \" Ah, tank you; I shaU go de way oi all flesh some day, zen I wiU call.\" \" Very Uttle originality we see to day,\" remarked Edie, with an air of superiority ; \" very seldom one comes upon any new idea.\" \" Tink of a modest, patient student, who believes zat anybody knows better zan himseU,\" muttered the professor, drily. \"Zere is a new idea.

Say vat it is you vant and be quick, for ze students vUl say ' UzeUi can't seU his pictures and Mr. Levy, of Wardour Street, is come to take dem in pawn.\" The party then salhed homeward. On the way the professor made some trifling purchase at a draper's, and some of the young men behind the counter teased him for orders to the exhibitions.

Arthur Joyce was not the worst of them. He was good natured, and clever to a certain extent, but reckless and improvident to the last degree. Adrian had met him once or tAvice before, but Mr. Joyce had always spcken of his nephew in such disparaging terms that Adrian knew he would be well pleased to know that they were not acquainted. There was a motive more than Adrian was aware of in Arthur Joyce seeking his acquaint ance. Adrian, as he knew, held frequent commu nication with his uncle, who had an awkward knack of dropping into his chambers in the Temple when least expected. If Arthur could make friends with the young painter and learn when his relative was likely to be coming to town, he thought it would be extremely convenient, and save him from many a scrape. \" Holloa! my jolly young painter, where do"], [124, "116 LOST FOOTSTEPS. you hang out now,\" was his first salutation when Adrian turned round and saw him. Adrian gave him his address and invited him to call. He was just now so gloomy that he would have welcomed anybody. \" And what has the antique buffer been doing lately ?\" \" If you mean Mr. Joyce,\" said Adrian, quietly, \" I have not seen him for some time.\" \" You look out and out seedy, my young sweU.\" Now, Adrian was especially careful about his dress, and, however plainly he was clad, was always particularly neat in his appearance. He had read Goethe's opinion of the absurd cant, that men of talent need be \u2014 or generaUy are \u2014 slovenly in their attire, and quite agreed with him. \" I don't mean, old boy, that anything's Avrong with your coat or trowsers,\" cried Arthur, merrUy, \" but you look down on your luck, rather dickey in fact.\" \" I am not very famiUar with slang,\" Adrian said, rather stiffly, \" but I suppose you to mean that I am out of spirits, and if so, you are quite right.\""], [125, "117 THE MASQUERADE. \" Slang be blowed !

Now, Adrian was perfectly well aware that neither his uncle nor Mr. Joyce would approve this companionship. He was not particularly anxious for it himseU, but the affair promised a few hours' amusement, and could not possibly bring any harm with it. Punctually at the hour appointed then, Adrian found himseU seated at one of Verrey's tables with three other companions, and a most elegant Uttle dinner was served. How Arthur Joyce could be so"], [126, "118 LOST FOOTSTEPS. prodigal of his cash was a mystery to Adrian, for he knew that his uncle, who was left trustee of a small property upon the young man's behalf, kept him pretty short of funds. Arthur, however, insisted upon paying for everything, and after dinner sundry bottles of champagne made their appearance ; and Adrian, whose general mode of living was of the plainest description, found him seU rather light-headed at the close of the repast. \" Now, boys,\" cried Arthur, who was no more affected than he would have been by a draught of pure water, \" let's have a lark, and first we'll drop in and hear Mademoiselle Verney.\" \"Verney, by all means,\" echoed the others, and in five minutes the party were on their way to a popular music haU, where a young singer who had only appeared but a few days in London, was already immensely popular.

His estimate of his OAvn abilities had wonderfully modified since his faUure at the exhibition. He was contented now to wait, and began to take pupils and teach in schools. He was not absolutely compelled to do so, as most young artists are, giving up their time to school girls, many of whom can hardly be taught the difference between a cow and a donkey \u2014 but Adrian wished to burden his friend as httle as possible, and also to test his capabilities to the uttermost.

He loved the church like a Uving thing, and so many happy years of his hfe had been spent at Molton that he hoped fervently to end his days there. He would not have exchanged his calm unos tentatious lUe for the richest living in some black manufacturing town. Here every blade of grass \u2014 every wUd-flower that blossomed in the hedge rows \u2014every trickling stream and cloudlet in the sky, spoke to him eloquently of the things nearest his heart, and he was happy. He was, indeed, younger in heart and feeling than many a man of five-and-twenty. Mr. Hope received his nephew dehghtedly, and they chatted for some time in the churchyard. Adrian could not saU to perceive as they walked home the good understanding that subsisted be tween the curate and his flock, for whoever they met returned his warm greeting with interest. It was a happy day that first day he spent at Molton."], [153, "NEWS FROM ABROAD. 145 When he came down to breakfast on the fol loAving morning there was a sad expression upon his uncle's face, which was very unusual.

After a time he took a letter from his pocket and attempted to read it, evidently not for the first time, but his eyes fiUed with tears, and, replacing it in his pocket, he went back to the house evidently much disturbed. Meanwhile Adrian, wandering alone, had leisure to think over his labours during the past year, and as he did so was disposed to beUeve that he had not met with his due, and was in clined to rah at those feUow students whom he had found it impossible to surpass. How often it is so with the young when first disenchanted. In time, when disappointment has taught them moderation, their ideas harmonise better with those of the world at large. Sometimes, when he discussed the matter with Mr. Joyce, he blamed Uzelh for giving too much encouragement, but this Mr. Joyce would not listen to, only telling him again and again to trust mainly to that invincible qualification \u2014 hard work and not to be impatient. His feUow students"], [155, "NEVA'S FROM ABROAD. 147 laughed at him. They were too accustomed to then own faUures to pay much attention to his. They ridiculed him because they beUeved that his repining arose \u2014 as it generally does in such cases \u2014 from disappointed vanity alone. But that was not all in Adrian's case. He saw Maude and Alice growing up to womanhood, and questioned whether the day might not come soon, when they would regard him as an intruder unless able to provide for himself. Another cause of despondency oppressed him also. Each of his fellow students had parents living, and when any new work was finished they were eager to hear what fathers, mothers, or sisters would say of the achievement. Lat terly, too, questions had been asked Adrian as to his own parentage, and surprise expressed that he knew so Uttle upon that subject. Indeed, until lately, Adrian had never thought about it at aU. His uncle and Mr. Joyce were so kind, and Maude and AUce such pleasant companions, that he had never felt the want of other relatives. These vague questions from his fellow students,"], [156, "148 LOST FOOTSTEPS. having only youthful curiosity for their basis, had, however, made Adrian somewhat fretful. He awoke suddenly to the idea that there was some thing dubious about his antecedents, but he shrank from enquiry. As to the scene from \" Faust,\" which was to have immortalized him, he had long ago detected the causes of its faUure. It was spoUed by over confidence, by want of more careful study, by lack of judgment and experience ; and U critics were silent, it was, he now fuUy beUeved, through forbearance. It was late in the afternoon when he came home, determined to ask his uncle some particulars of the father whom he beheved to have been dead for many years. Maud and Ahce, he knew, had gone to visit a neighbour, and would not be home for some hours. So much the better, for it would give him a chance of a quiet chat with his uncle.

He had not intended to play the eavesdropper, and had he recollected that he was doing so would have blushed with honest shame, but the few words that were exchanged with Mrs. Crankley when she came, eo enchained him that he -was rooted to the spot. The fragments of a dialogue, indistinctly heard, r&ached him thus, \u2014 * I have been sorely tried since yesterday, Mrs. Crankley.\" \" I am grieved to hear it, sir. \" You can probably guess the cause, ma'am.\" \" T think I can, sir ! you heard from Australia yesterday.\" \" I did.\" \" No bad news, I hope, sir. \" Bad I ought not perhaps to call it, but ex tremely perplexing just now.

He was so astounded that he could hardly beheve his own ears. The curate took from his pocket the letter we have already referred to and began to read it slowly, being frequently interrupted by exclama tions from Mrs. Crankley. Adrian waited, hardly breathing or moving a musole. \" After deliberating many weary months,\" the writer began, \" I have at length, dear Percival, yielded to my desire to see England once more.

It was a soft autumn evening, and the fresh breeze came to his cheek laden with delicious odours on its wings. The setting sun glimmered with a heavenly radiance through the tops of the trees, and there was a glory and richness in the landscape seen at no other period of the year.

Many hours passed that night before Adrian could summon up courage to return home. He wandered so long indeed that his uncle had been out more than once in search of him.

Mr. Hope, perhaps, feeling that it would solve one of the greatest difficulties he saw respecting his brother's return, and not doubting that Adrian would soon recover his former spirits, and perhaps be benefited by the change, made no further objection, and Mr. Joyce wrote a letter of warm recommendation to Mynheer Kalm. Adrian gave up his studies with a sense of delight in the prospect of action and enterprise."], [175, "167 ROTTERDAM.

On account of the tide they quitted the pool at night. The dusky forms of the vessels in the river, the noise of the vehicles rolhng along the distant streets, the long reflections of the Ughts across the stream, the solemn strokes of the chimes in various parts of the city, the hoarse cries of the bargemen as they passed down with the tide, made up a picturesque and novel spectacle ; and he thought with satisfaction, \" one feels it is this vigorous, actual hfe that has made us, as English men, what we are. We have splendid artistic talent here and there, but commerce and adven ture wiU always be the true life of Englishmen.\" He became a little less enthusiastic when the steamer reached the channel, and miserable passengers began to succumb to the agonies of sea sickness.

It was his first experience of the sea, and mightily pleased was our hero when they reached Rotterdam. Mr. Joyce had given Adrian such particulars of his future employer's residence that he had very Uttle difficulty in finding the address, but never in his Use had the young artist been so astonished as upon his first introduction to Myn heer Kabn. He arrived at Rotterdam early in the morning. It was a warm bright morning in September, and the domestic who received him, and who could speak a httle English, made him easily understand that Mynheer was in the summer-house at the end of the garden. To the summer-house, accordingly, Adrian went, across a yard paved with many-coloured stones ; past a little fish-pond, in whioh there was a most wonderful house buUt of shells; past an aviary fuU of birds of every variety of plumage, and making every variety of soreeching noise that could afflict the ear; past a magnificent bed of"], [177, "ROTTERDAM. 169 tulips ; then he stopped a moment to look at four and-twenty windmUls in the distance, whirling round as though the prosperity of Holland de pended upon their activity; another moment, to glance down the long canal at the foot of the garden, which he fancied must have been the subject of a painting by Cuyp at Hampton Court Palace ; finally, he brought himseU to an anchor before the door of a very gaudily-painted summer house. In this summer-house sat a gentleman of un usual dimensions, and this gentleman was Mynheer Kalm, and Mynheer Kabn was fast asleep. Adrian was so much amused by the novelty of aU he saw, that he would most likely have looked about him for some time without awakening the sleeper, but whUe he stood musing the clock of some distant steeple struck the hour. The sound, faint as it was, aroused Mynheer from his slum bers; but before he honoured Adrian with his notice, he tinkled a httle beU which stood upon the table before him, and then, without speaking or"], [178, "170 LOST FOOTSTEPS. expressing the least astonishment at Adrian's presence, simply motioned him to a seat by his side. The next moment a round httle woman, who might have stepped out of a picture by Teniers, came into the arbour with some tea. Mynheer pointed to a cup placed near Adrian, who helped himseU and wondered what would come next. \" Speech is sUver, but silence is gold,\" says the philosopher of Chelsea, and how he would have revelled in the society of Mynheer Kalm, who drank his tea so slowly that Adrian fancied it must have taken at least five hundred sips to finish his cup. Then he poured out and drank a second cup ; then he fiUed his meerschaum, brought it by easy stages within range of his hps, gazing all the while placidly at the long canal. He evi dently derived some vague and indefinite grati fication from that inspection, puffing his meers chaum so steadily that the smoke came forth in one continuous thread as though it had been from a cottage chimney. This performance con tinued for an hour or more, and not a word had yet been spoken."], [179, "ROTTERDAM. 171 \" Why did not Mr. Joyce tell me that his relative was dumb,\" thought Adrian. \"I wonder U the dumb alphabet is in use in HoUand. I've half a mind to try the effect of it.\" Suddenly, when he had begun to give up all hope of a conversation with his employer, he was astonished to perceive a mysterious heaving of Mynheer's chest ; stiU more astonished U pos sible when he heard escaping from that vast repo sitory something hke a sigh, and his astonishment increased beyond aU bounds when that gentleman gave vent in English to the following remarkable words : \u2014 \" She is gone.\" Too much surprised to speak, Adrian hardly knew what to think of this. He looked over the garden, thinking, perhaps, it was the servant Mynheer wanted, and was about to tinkle the little beU wliich stood near him, when Mynheer, arriving at the conclusion that Adrian had mis understood him, said faintly, shaking his head \u2014 \" Her daughter lives.\" Adrian began to fancy now that there was a"], [180, "172 LOST FOOTSTEPS. clue to this mysterious language. Mr. Joyce had told him that Mynheer had one daughter, whom he loved passing weU. The fact of Adrian coming from England with an introduction from his brother-in-law perhaps reminded the Dutchman of the loss of his wife. With regard to his speaking Enghsh Adrian had already learned that fact. Indeed, Mynheer, since the death of his wife, would never have anybody about him who could not speak a Uttle of our language. The ice thus broken, Adrian began to hope for further conversation, but there he had certainly reckoned without his host. Time passed. The round little servant brought some business-papers, which Mynheer read, and appeared for a few seconds almost animated. When, however, these were disposed of, during which time Adrian took a turn up and down the garden, it was nearly twelve o'clock. Mynheer tinkled the aforesaid beU and ordered lunch, which speedUy oame \u2014 a most substantial repast indeed \u2014 to which Adrian, now recovering rapidly from the effects of a sea voyage, did ample"], [181, "173 ROTTERDAM. justice, and evidently raised himself by the per formance in Mynheer's estimation. The meal finished, Mynheer again filled his meerschaum, again puffed steadily \u2014 startling Adrian for a moment by rising and walking \u2014 not rapidly, be certain \u2014 to the edge of the canal. Had the worthy man any idea of suicide ? No such deed was contemplated. It was only one of Mynheer's barges which passed along the canal at this hour every day, and it evidently gave the proprietor more satisfaction to see it glide past at a snail's pace, than to have witnessed the most elaborate state ceremonial. Adrian had heard Mr. Joyce speak of Mynheer's only daughter as a most accomplished and beau tiful ghl and he was a little curious to see her, but Mynheer spent the remainder of the day in his beloved garden. He sipped more cups of tea, smoked his meerschaum again and again, napped frequently, and at last, evidently knocked up with the fatigues of the day, shook Adrian by the hand, and once more ejaculating in a doleful tone, \" She is gone,\" went off to bed."], [182, "174 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Soaroo knowing what else to do, Adrian sought \u2022jut the round little woman aforesaid, who showed him his bedroom, and he speedily followed the example of his illustrious master. He learned afterwards that Mynheer's daughter Louise, had been away from home on a visit, but had just returned aa her father was going to hed. Having seen little of the town on the previous day, our young artist thought it would pass an hour agreeably to wander about the streets early the next morning. Ho found it very <]ui*t at first, but soon \u2014 being Saturday, the general clearing-up day throughout Holland \u2014 the streets became quite lively, and Adrian thought tl\u00ab general character of the Dutch for cleanliness had certainly been well earned. The houses, even tha poorest, had a purified look. He could understand, now, the clearness and precision of those old Dutch painters. In most countries ruin, dirt, and decay, are the pro minent picturesque features; but here they rubbed, scrubbed, and polished everything. They clHanpd the pavements \u2014 they cleaned the floors \u2014 they"], [183, "ROTTERDAM. 175 cleaned the furniture, and lest not a square inch of waU or partition untouched \u2014 they cleaned the ceilings \u2014 they cleaned the windows, and continued the cleaning tiU the mops, brushes, and brooms, by which aU this cleanhness had been effected, received a purification in their turn. Nothing escaped the lynx eye of the Dutch housewife. In vain does the domestic, partly from charity, partly from weariness \u2014 give hberty and licence for a moment to an unlucky spider. The sharp voice of her chief recaUs her to a sense of her duty, and away is swept the unhappy spinner, cobweb and aU. The state-room of the famUy is put in order on this day with due solemnity. Every spot of dust is banished from its haUowed precincts ; every Uttle ornament arranged in its exact position ; every chah placed in regimental hne, and then the room is shut from profane eyes tiU the following day. \" It would not require a very lively fancy,\" thought Adrian, \" getting up half awake in the morning, to imagine that one had been transported to the realms of father Neptune in the night,"], [184, "176 LOST FOOTSTEPS. seeing that one's bed is often lower than the bed of the river, and that sometimes vessels are saUing on a level with the chimney pots.\" Much amused with the topsy survey aspect of things in general, he, however, began to feel that he was ready for breakfast, and returned to Mynheer Kalm's house, narrowly escaping on his way a drenching from one of those Uttle engines which are used by the good people of Rotterdam in their cleansing operations. Coming into the house, Adrian haU fancied he caught the vision of a lady's dress disappearing through the doorway leading to the garden. He believed he was not mistaken, and was wondering at her sudden flight, when he recoUected that she had probably seen him by the aid of the smaU mirror against the window, so much in favour with the ladies in HoUand, and, perhaps, being shy, preferred to wait tUl her father came down, for Adrian at once decided it was Mynheer Kalm's daughter. The young lady had our hero a Uttle at a disadvantage, for by the aid of her mirror she"], [185, "177 ROTTERDAM, had already secured a mental photograph of his appearance. Looking into the garden Adrian saw Mynheer speaking to an odd-looking person \u2014 whom he afterwards ascertained was Mynheer Vanderbeck \u2014 through a gate on one side of the garden, which had been placed there that the friends might have ready access to their rival flower beds and summer houses. The inscription upon Mynheer Kalm's summer-house was \" Vriendschap en gezelschap \" (friendship and sociability). Mynheer brought his odd-looking neighbour in to breakfast, and then his daughter joined them, and a greater contrast than that between father and daughter Adrian thought he had never seen. Louise was young, hardly more, the young artist thought, than eighteen years of age, and with a style of countenance which he had never dreamt of seeing in HoUand. An oval face, with a forehead as white and clear as marble; long lashes, half concealing very dark blue eyes ; features without any of the vulgarity common to Dutch females in general, well defined as the outlines 12 VOL.

She was a httle diffident at first, but her curiosity to hear about England, and everything English, soon conquered her reserve, and she so plied Adrian with questions that they were quickly engaged in a Uvely conversation, made none the less pleasing by the sweet fresh tone of Louise's voice, and the least possible foreign accent. A slight interruption took place in eonsequenoe of a visit from Kloots, the manager, who had some special intelligence for his master. He was a man of about thirty, active, and inteUigent looking ; though, it could be readUy seen, a victim to seU-indulgence, for the traces of heavy potations on the previous night had hardly dis appeared yet. It seemed that the previous day had been a hohday in Mynheer Kalm's estabhshment, and that was why he had spent the whole day in his"], [187, "179 ROTTERDAM. summer-house. It is hardly fair to ridicule him ; seeing that he was shut out from snow-crowned heights, woody glens, white cliffs, or roaring waterfaUs, he could hardly be blamed for making the most of the enjoyments he had. A large quantity of timber had just arrived, and Kloots was in his element. Breakfast was speedily despatched, and, in company with the manager, Adrian walked down to the wharf to be initiated into his new duties. He was already more cheerful, and thought of that passage from Richter, of whose works he was extremely fond, \" Happy is every actor in the vain drama caUed hfe, to whom the higher illusion within supplies or conceals the illusion without ; to whom, in the tumult of his part, and its intellectual interest, the clumsy landscapes of the stage have the bloom and reality of nature, and who is not disturbed in his dream by the noisy shifting of the scenes.\" But there was something more than even the delicate fancies of the German prose poet, which gave to everything he saw a magical colouring,"], [188, "180 LOST FOOTSTEPS. and made the long canals, the monotonous dykes, the quaintly-gabled buildings, and lumbering vessels in the stream, more romantic than any thing he had yet seen since the fairy land of childhood. Something that recalled, he knew not how, the exquisite sensations of that happy period \u2014 something that filled him with delightful anticipations, and made him wonder why the remembrance of past failures should vanish Uke a dream. Could he imagine what had so soon dispelled his former gloom ? Perhaps not, for he had not yet questioned himseU upon that point. We may be permitted to reveal the secret not yet known to Adrian himself. It was simply that he was in love. They passed on their way to the wharf, the quay called the Boompjes, a pleasant spot lined with large old trees, where on a fine evening numbers promenaded ; and many an hour did Adrian stroll there afterwards, hardly knowing whether to curse or bless the fate that led him to Rotterdam. But of that more hereafter. Kloots lived with his mother in apartments at"], [189, "ROTTERDAM. 181 the wharf, and Mynheer often gave the old lady a caU when he came to business. As they entered her apartments, the vrow, Kloots, was just caU ing for her \" vaur stoof,\" which Adrian, who had already caught up a few words of Dutch from their similarity in many instances to his own language, translated into \" fire 6tove.\" A servant brought the \" fire stove \" into the room. It was a square httle wooden box, in which was placed an earthenware pan filled with hot turf. Adrian was rude enough to smile when he saw the venerable dame place her feet upon this, as though it had been a footstool. His surprise diminished afterwards, when he found that it was an universal custom, owing to the dampness of the climate, and he saw even the same evening, scores of these boxes in the lobby of the theatre. The steamer for London was puffing alongside the quay, and a crowd of passengers making their way to it, when Adrian was startled to hear his own name pronounced in no subdued tone. Turning quickly he saw a young gentleman, of whom mention has already been made \u2014 Mr."], [190, "182 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Joyce's nephew. Adrian had not seen him since the night of the masquerade ; and, perhaps, had he met Arthur in London, he would hardly have cared for the recognition. Arthur was so thought less and extravagant, so httle disposed to follow any steady occupation, and gave himself up so entirely to a life of excitement, that Adrian felt a little afraid of him. He was a rattlebrain fellow, whom few tourists would have selected as a companion ; but having found another to join him, so like himself that they might have been mistaken for brothers, this notable pair had started from the Temple upon the impulse of the moment for a foreign tour. \" Why, where on earth are you going ? \" enquired Adrian, \" I thought you were studying law in the Temple.\" \"Been doing a tour, old fellow \u2014 going back again now, nearly stumped, I can tell you. Seen the ancient Briton lately ?\" \" If you mean your uncle \u2014 yes.

Everywhere \u2014 up the Rhine, Paris, Switzerland, the Tyrol, and fifty other places for the matter of that.\" \" Then you have been away from London some time.\" \" Not a bit of it. Take this neighbourhood for instance \u2014 see it all in a day \u2014 we did it yesterday \u2014 Koordenoord windmills, stained glass windows of Gouda, picture gaUery at the Hague, statue of Erasmus down the street yonder, five minutes to hear the organ in the Niew Kerk, and finished up at night at a tea-garden outside the town.\" \" Are you acquainted with the language ?\" \" Oh, quite so,\" winking at his companion, who was convulsed with the exquisite joke. \" In fact, my dear feUow, you can't help being famUiar with the language.

His task was not difficult, and in the course of a few days he was perfectly competent to discharge the duties required of him. Kloots became the best friends possible with him, and after a time"], [193, "185 ROTTERDAM. amused our hero with many whimsical anec dotes of himself. One of his adventures had earned for him the cognomen of Erasmus Kloots, and it was told to Adrian, when he had acquired sufficient know ledge of the language to enter into its absurdity. Kloots \u2014 so he said \u2014 was returning from a festive party at one of the tea-gardens in the out skirts of the toAvn, having made pretty free with sundry beverages more potent than tea, and was endeavouring by the light of the moon to dis tinguish \u2014 not always an easy task in Holland \u2014 the water from the land. When he entered the Kerk Straat, and arrived in front of the statue of Erasmus he felt himself so overcome with veneration for learning (or Schiedam) that he stood for some time gazing at the statue in speechless admhation. WhUe doing so the clock of the Niew Kerk struck twelve, and suddenly to the great horror of Kloots, he saw the hand of the scholar upraised as U beckon ing to him.

While in this state of hesitation, the statue, like that fearful one im mortalized in \" Don Giovanni,\" spoke to him. \"What art thou doing here?\" it said. \" Pardon me, great Sir, \" Kloots rephed tremblingly, \"I was musing upon thy former greatness.\" \" Kloots,\" said the statue, \" would'st thou also become a great man ?\" Kloots muttered something in reply \u2014 he never could remember what \u2014 but it was to the effect that he would not object to have greatness thrust upon him. \" Follow me, then,\" said the statue. Kloots affirmed \u2014 though his veracity was often questioned when he told the tale by those acquainted with his habits \u2014 that he followed the figure of the scholar into the Niew Kerk, that the organ played a voluntary, that a blaze of hght illuminated the altar, and again the statue spoke and said, \u2014 \"Beneath the pavement of this church an awful secret is concealed.

Art thou aU of these ?\" Kloots hesitated somewhat, but rephed \" Yes, he was.\" \" Honest ?\" asked the statue \" Yes.\" \"And a Protestant?\" \" Yes.\" \" And a sober man ?\" Kloots asserted that just as he was about to reply in the affirmative, the ponderous arm of the statue descended with awful force upon his head. A thousand dancing lights before his eyes obscured the lights upon the altar, and the drumming in his ears, quite overpowered the sound of the organ. All he could remember further, was that a bargeman picked him up in the morning and assisted him home to the wharf, saying that Kloots had fallen and stunned himself. Kloots, however, would not accept this version ; but was so emphatic as to the vision he had wit nessed, that he was frequently named Erasmus amongst his associates in future."], [196, "CHAPTER XIV. On the Lawn. Mynheer Kalm long continued a puzzle to Adrian. The oddity of his manners seemed to increase rather than diminish as they became better acquainted. That such a man should have ever married, was a fertile source of wonderment to the young painter, especiaUy that he should have taken an Enghsh wUe, too, who was both young, beautiful, witty and animated. He sup posed it must have been from that love of oppo sites, which induces thin spare men to conceive violent admhation for extremely fuU-blown beau ties, and makes taU, strapping feUows, bend lovingly over Uttle dots of wives, who have to stand on tiptoe to reach their husbands' arms. If Mynheer had been fascinated by the conver sational powers of his wUe, such abilities could"], [197, "180 ON THE LAWN'. not have teen greatly exercised after marriage, seeing that Mynheer rarely got beyond \" yes\" or \" no \" in the most important matters ; never theless, in this sedate manner, he had contrived to imiass a handsome fortune without ruuoh trouble. Sometimes without speaking a syllable, had Myn heer managed to put many a goodly sum into his purse \u2014 such is the force of genius. Let us give an illustration. A dealer comes to offer him a cargo of timber, and names a price. Then commences Mynheer's grand diplomacy. Instead of showing eagerness, he says nothing, and looks, if possible, less than that. The seller repeats his price, but Mynheer does not speak or smile, he simply slowly and methodically shakes his head, and not in any rapid random way either. That would put tea per cent, at least upon the purchase. The seller feels what a power is before him and succumbs to the pressure.

Now shines forth the genius of Kalm. He can read character at least ; and, knowing what an excellent bargain he has made, the motion of his head is gradually reversed, an entry is made in his pocket-book, and Mynheer departs in peace. It was no wonder that his reputation in Rot terdam for sagacity stood high. He had earned it. Let no man say that fortune is beyond his grasp, U he can but be silent and shake his head. Mynheer could not boast of wealthy parentage. He had received no education. He could not lay claim to the possession of special knowledge ; his bulky form precluded activity, yet fortune had flowed to him as steadUy as the canals of his beloved fatherland flowed to the sea.

From the first glance Adrian had been pleased with her, then he was dazzled, then gave himseU uputterly to her influence, without further thought or consideration. In moments of enthusiasm her whole nature seemed lighted up by some electrical charm. Her eyes brightened \u2014 her cheeks glowed \u2014 her voice became meltingly sweet and tender, and Adrian could hardly be blamed, if he sometimes was led to beUeve that he had inspired Louise with some interest in himseU. She had many lovers already, or such as con sidered themselves in that Ught, notwithstanding the scant encouragement they received. All who came within the magical circle of her attractions coveted her goodwiU and affection, and doubtless many felt, as did Adrian, that she was capable of loving passionately U once her deeper nature could be touched; but she seemed happy and careless in the present, and indifferent as to the future.

Louise was in the highest spirits. She was an excellent musician, and played and sang a quantity of fine German music, in which M. Morel, who had a tenor voice, of good quality, joined her. Adrian, having so little experience of the effective manners which men accustomed to society readily acquire, felt himself completely thrown into the shade. M. Morel had showy talents.

Morel passed his early years \u2014 a circle where aspiration was sneered at, and sentiment ignored, and where seU-indulgence, was elevated to the dignity of a creed. Guillaume Morel proved himseU an apt pupU in this estimable school of phUosophy. He had hardly passed boyhood ere he became en tangled in a disreputable connexion with a young Frenchwoman engaged at the opera. As the lady wished to remain a short time in Brussels, while negociating another engagement, the money with which the banker's son was liberally suppUed answered her purpose admir ably, and, for a time, the lady was wonderfully gracious. GuiUaume was, however, astonished at the end of a few weeks to find himseU suddenly"], [248, "240 LOST FOOTSTEPS. deserted by the frail fair one, and being con stantly taunted by his youthful companions, was anxious to leave Brussels for a time, to regain his lost laurels. Madame Morel had acquired, meanwhile, con siderable political influence, and succeeded in getting her handsome son appointed in some official capacity at Berlin. But Guillaume hated anything that required thought or study, and looked upon real knowledge as pedantry, only aspiring to be a brilliant member of society. He had already obtained some influence in fashionionable circles, partly owing to his good looks, partly, perhaps, to his doubtful relations with the fair sex, and not a little also to his facility in languages. This talent had not cost him much trouble, having from his chUdhood led a sort of polyglot existence. For the rest, he was worldly, had no lofty feehngs, no warm sympathies, \u2014 yet so potent and deceptive is the charm of manner over the world at large, that Guillaume Morel soon obtained in every circle"], [249, "M.

Thus, many a learned and original mind had been deceived as to the extent of his powers. Becoming disgusted with Berlin, M. Morel came back to Brussels, and took part in the political agitation caused by the rupture of Holland with Belgium. He had no patriotism, but simply desired excitement and change, and when the fever consequent upon the aroused nationaUties, and the partizan feelings connected with the above events had subsided, he went to HoUand, and remained there tiU the death of his father gave him possession of the wealth and influence he coveted ; he bought a fine estate near Rotterdam, and his mother came there to reside with him. 16 VOL.

After several years of fashionable life and dissipation, he now fancied he should relish the charm of a pure and quiet home. His old companions were deserted for the society of Louise. Madame Morel saw that her son was fascinated, and encouraged him by every means in her power, feehng sure it would not be long before GuUlaume openly declared his passion. Louise was young, gay, and piquante \u2014 the kind of ghl to take the fancy of such a man. He was stUl handsome, and youthful-looking, and the confidence in himseU, inspired by his general reception in society, led him to imagine that he would not have a very difficult part to play. Matters were in this state when the journey up the Rhine was planned, and Louise, bent upon enjoyment, entered into the scheme heartUy. Of course, with Mynheer Kalm it was a purely business affair ; he, worthy man, had he not been teased beyond all endurance, by Louise, would"], [251, "M.

Adrian, stiU in hopes that some good angel would interpose in his behaU with Louise, accepted the invitation, joyfully. He had heard and read so much of the Rhine, that his artistic faculties began to revive again in anticipation.

Madame Morel and her son, for some reason, could not start with them, and they journeyed up the river till they arrived at Bingen, where Louise expected their friends would most likely join them. She had behaved to Adrian with the greatest kindliness, and as she appeared utterly indifferent as to the advent of M. Morel, he began to hope at last that the story of her feelings toward that gentleman was a myth. But, with his impulsive temperament, it was a most difficult task to restrain himseU; and it is hardly too muoh to say that he would have welcomed an earthquake or tornado about as cheerfully as the \" coming man,\" M.

Kloots was absent, having gone secretly to a special store, where he had ascertained a supply of genuine Schiedam could be obtained. There had been some difficulty in satisfying Mynheer's palate in this respect; but, fortunately, the manager arrived at that moment with one of those mysterious flasks which are the daUy deUght of Dutchmen, and said \u2014 \" I have just seen the captain of the raft, Mynheer.

He had touched a sympathetic chord.

Kloots found his mouth water in hvely an ticipation as the cork was drawn ; but Mynheer Kalm was too shrewd a tactician to entrust him with the flask in its present state.

This estimable lady had fully made up her mind to win Louise for her son in spite of him seU. Aware that any direct antagonism might only pique the young beauty, she adopted a cautious system of persecution, which was not ineffective in its way, and certainly damaged the young painter's cause considerably. Her policy was never to omit an opportunity of leading the conversation to some topic in whioh GuUlaume Morel could distinguish himseU, and his rival could not ; and so successful was she upon many occasions, that Adrian was made to appear dull and pedantic, beside the accomplished man cf the world. Madame's annoyance at the power and brilliancy of Adrian's sketches, she was scarcely able to conceal, especially as Louise evidently regarded his talent as something almost marvellous, and gave him greater credit for his work than it reaUy deserved. Sometimes Madame Morel's chagrin was vented in a more energetic manner, as for instance, when she said with assumed candour \u2014 \" We shall all regret, Mr. Hope, U you do not"], [265, "257 DIPLOMACY. foUow your art.

Picnics and boating excursions took place daUy, greatly to the satisfaction of Madame, who saw less danger of Adrian's rivalry than when he was sketching for Louise, or amusing her with souvenirs of English hfe.

She was evidently stUl in doubt as to her own feelings. At one moment full of merriment and gaiety, and another sad and reserved, treating Adrian with the greatest warmth, and then disappointing him with her coldness an hour afterwards. Once when they were left alone together, Louise had applauded some sketch of his with unusual warmth ; intoxicated with her praise, he was looking at her with a haU-dreamy enthu siastic gaze. A deeper fehng than she imagined filled the heart of the young painter as he said, in tones that were tremulous with passion, \"How I wish I could transfer your expression at this moment to the canvas ; I might rival then some of the greatest masters.\" The subdued tone in which he uttered the words, deepened as it was by real emotion, gave Louise some stings of conscience, but, an instant"], [267, "259 DIPLOMACY. after, that sudden coldness which so often chilled him, returned, and she thought: \" He is only thinking of me, as an artist might, after aU. There is no real feeUng in this ; the charm of a glowing landscape would equally affect him.\" Thus, as vessels, hidden by an island in a stream, pass each other unseen, and reach opposite corners of the earth, do human hearts and human sympathies approach, and then divide for ever. Adrian, fondly imagining that he was a little nearer to the shrine, was supremely happy, and sketched an outhne portrait of Louise, intending to finish it at night, from memory. Unluckily, for him, Madame Morel had, this very day, taken her son to task for his over confidence respecting Louise. She had lost no opportunity of drawing his attention to the apparently growing influence of the young painter, and the pair coming upon Louise and Adrian at this moment, Madame gave her son a telegraphic glance, which was not lost upon"], [268, "260 LOST FOOTSTEPS. him, and was the cause of his showing Louise the most marked attention for the remainder of the day. And when Guillaume Morel had decided to be agreeable, it was very difficult indeed to detect his sincerity, and very difficult also to resist him. He was so gracious to Adrian, that the young artist felt it impossible to be ill-tempered, though wishing him at Jericho \u2014 grew complimentary upon the subject of art, though in reality he did not known a Van dyke from a Vandaub, and was altogether such an agreeable and polished cavaUer, that once more Madame Morel grew radiant, as she watched the evidently awakening interest of Louise. It was nearly nightfall when they returned to the hotel, but Adrian sat up some hours work ing at the portrait of Louise. When at last he went to bed, he placed the picture so that he might see it the first moment he awoke. \"It is hardly possible,\" he murmured, as he thought upon the pleasant hours he had spent"], [269, "DIPLOMACY. 261 with her that day, \" that Louise can be utterly destitute of true feehng with such a face as that.\" A day or two later they were on their way to Rotterdam, and the portrait was not shown till they reached home. When Mynheer Kalm went into his beloved summer house on the following day, to read his business letters, enjoy his after-dinner nap, and smoke unmolested, the first object that met his gaze was the portrait of his daughter. Mynheer had not the slightest appreciation of art, but there could be no mistaking the original of this sketch, and he sat staring at it tiU it was quite dark, in a petrified state of admhation. A message from Louise, that Madame Morel and her son had come to spend an evening with them, aroused him at last, and the old gentleman took the picture into the house with the greatest care. He said not a word when told it was Adrian's work ; but the next morning there was found upon his desk at the wharf, an envelope, addressed to him in Mynheer's"], [270, "262 LOST FOOTSTEPS. singular handwriting, enclosing: a bank note for a considerable amount, but without a single word of explanation, or comment. In vain did Adrian spend half-an-hour in the private counting house of his employer, explaining that he could not possibly accept the gift. Mynheer had never been so obtuse. A look of unutterable vacuity was all the attention he bestowed upon the young painter, who could not get a single word out of him, and gave up the effort in despair ; but when at last he attempted to place the note in Mynheer's hand, he was met by such an emphatic shake of the head, that he felt it would be an offence to refuse the present any longer. It is just possible Kloots may have been mistaken, but he assured Adrian an hour later, that he had actuaUy seen Mynheer ohuckling with suppressed merriment as he entered the counting house that morning, and enquired U Adrian knew of any good news which his worthy employer had received.

A post of honour, and a magnificent gold frame, was awarded to Adrian's portrait, and aroused Madame Morel's antagonism. The first time she was alone with Louise, she said, with a glance of peculiar meaning, \" My darhng Louise, your friend is certainly very clever, and I admire the Ukeness greatly ; but I hope he is not complacently taking your portrait to serve as a model for a stupid Venus, or Titania, or some day my charming girl wUl be figuring in a pubUc gaUery with less drapery than is consistent with the modesty of the original.

She had conjured up this idea to undermine Louise's sympathy with Adrian, and was delighted to perceive that it was not ineffective. Madame certainly used"], [272, "264 LOST FOOTSTEPS. her weapons skilfully, and now the ice was fairly broken, brought her heaviest artillery to bear upon Louise. She painted in gloAving colours, the happiness it would be to become more than a mother to the wUe of GuiUaume, U he would but marry.

Owing to the recommendation of Mr. Joyce, Adrian was treated rather as a friend of the family, than as an ordinary clerk; stUl Louise could easUy perceive that the duties of the wharf were already becoming distasteful, and she frequently rallied him upon his want of perseverance in giving up art so readily. \"I am confident you are too restless, too enthusiastic, too ambitious,\" she said, \" to settle down as a man of business, and devote your life to the mechanical drudgery of the counting house.

The simple unassuming mode of life he had been accustomed to at Molton rendered the habits and customs of fashionable life absolute mysteries to him. \" We have been seeking everywhere for Mademoiselle Louise,\" said a voice close at hand, which startled her for a moment ; \" Avill Mr. Hope permit me to rob him of his charming companion?\" It was M. Morel, who assured Louise that the company upon the terrace of the chateau were dying for her society in some amusement that was going forward at the moment. \" The grounds look their best, to-day,\" re marked Louise, as she suffered herseU to be led by M. Morel to the terrace ; \" you ought to be very happy, Monsieur, in such a beautUul place.\" M. Morel shrugged his shoulders. \" Pardon me, Mademoiselle, my lUe is too aimless \u2014 too monotonous.

He watched the opening brilliancy of spring ripen into the glowing warmth of summer \u2014 the rich luxuriance of autumn fade into the sad grey of winter, but seemed himself to have lost any share in their beauty.\" \" You are growing absolutely poetical, M. Morel.\" \" Can it be wondered at, MademoiseUe, when the illustration applies but too closely to one's self. I am Uving a lonely, uninteresting Use, and you, charming Louise, are the sole cause. I sit in these large rooms, staring at the flowers and trees, till I become disgusted with Use and with myself.\" It was the nearest approach M. Morel had yet made to a positive declaration. His eloquence was brought to a close by the clapping of hands and bravoes of the party upon the terrace, who greeted the host and his lovely companion with a rapturous welcome. Louise, it must be candidly stated, was too much of a woman not to feel gratified by the reception."], [277, "CHAPTER XX. Adrian's Return. The fete proceeded merrily for all but Adrian. Perhaps M. Morel felt that he had carried his nonchalance quite far enough ; for upon this par ticular occasion there was a warmth in his manner quite unusual. Adrian, becoming extremely unhappy, left the chateau early. He was perplexed and tantalised in the extreme, because he felt that U he could only make Louise understand him he would not fail to convince her of the purity and depth of his affection for her. The poor feUow, in his inex perience, never became aware of the fact that he totally misunderstood her. How gladly, remem bering the scene in the garden of M.

But the seU-possession aud gaiety with wliich she met every advance seemed so utterly repeUant, that he could not imagine it possible that any real feeling was lying beneath so apparently careless an exterior. He dared not beheve that it was in any degree assumed. Love in Adrian's case was something more than a sentiment, even more than a passion ; it was almost worship, and to him Louise was a divinity. There was another circumstance, which no doubt had some influence with Louise herself, and was undoubtedly made the most of by Madame Morel when pleading the cause of her son. This was the high estimation of worldly influence and position by the circle in which she moved. Young, lovely, wealthy and clever, Louise had from a child been petted and favoured, and it cannot be doubted that some repugnance to lay down the power so easily acquired may have passed through her mind when Adrian had declared his passion."], [279, "Adrian's return. 271 Adrian had often spoken enthusiastically of a life of art, foUowed in spite of aU obstacles, and triumphing over the humblest circumstances ; but this seemed to one accustomed to a luxurious mode of life to rob art of all enchantment, and to make it sordid and mean as other ordinary trades and common-place occupations, such as carpen tering, or shopkeeping in a smaU way. She had not the slightest knowledge of commercial matters, and even sympathised with Madame Morel when she spoke (as she often did) with undisguised contempt of Mynheer Kalm's deahngs at the wharf, notwithstanding the profits he made there. It must be confessed, that Louise in her secret heart was sorely puzzled as to the respective merits of Adrian and M. Morel, independently of theh position. One was full of impulse, energy, and talent, the other calcu lating, and worldly, and guided less by any principle, than by the code of the society in which he moved. She laughed at the high flown notions of the young artist, but at the"], [280, "272 LOST FOOTSTEPS. same time was convinced that he had a generous and noble nature. She was, unfor tunately, also constantly exposed to the sharp sarcasms of Madame Morel, whose keenness in finding out Adrian's weak points was almost inconceivable, and whose strategy in making them prominent, unconsciously to himseU, was in the highest degree ingenious. \" My darling,\" said that lady, \" the young painter is beyond doubt, very tender, and impassioned, and U one might judge by sighs and sorrowful looks, profoundly smitten ; but aU that sort of thing with these artistic people it is a trade. They are as ready to weep over a passage in a poem, as a child of five years old; and they cultivate aU sorts of admirations and extacies, merely to heighten the tone of their works, just as any actor or singer might do, only with ten times the pretence and affectation. They would play upon your feelings, my dear, as beautifully as you play upon the piano, U you would let them.\" \" ReaUy, Madame,\" replied Louise, blushing"], [281, "Adrian's return. 273 in spite of herself, and laughing too, \" you assume an extraordinary interest on my part in Mr. Hope's affiairs. Seeing that he came here as an assistant to papa, and was received upon friendly terms in consequence of the recommendation of my uncle Joyce, I cannot imagine why you so persistently couple my name with his.\" \"I know, darling \u2014 I know, perfectly weU\" \u2014 and Madame tapped her nose gently with the tip of her parasol, shaking her head at the same time with an air of the profoundest sagacity and know ledge of the world, making the impressionable girl feel haU ashamed of her famiharity with the painter. It was a movement so full of contemptuous disparagement, that Louise must reaUy have been very deeply attached to Adrian not to have been affected by it; and the young are so sensitive to ridicule that it may safely be said to be the strongest weapon that can be held by those advanced in years. \"Perhaps,\" thought Louise, \"Adrian may only vol. i. 18"], [282, "274 LOST FOOTSTEPS. be one of those who, however warmly they feel for a time, can be very happy under other circumstances, and bestow their affections as easily upon some new object.\" At all events, she had given him no encouragement, and rather resented the constant reference which Madame Morel made to him. If M. Morel really had any affection for her why did he not declare it himself. It was not agreeable to be wooed through a third person. That was not the way such matters were conducted in the exciting and wonderful French novels she borrowed from the library. There all was fire and passion \u2014 vows of eternal fidelity \u2014 tears of joy \u2014 ravings of unutter able despair \u2014 meetings and partings in secret places, far from the eyes of inexorable parents and watchful guardians.

That worthy lady had lest no stone unturned. It was very weU for Guillaume to marry beauty and talent, but Mynheer Kalm must be made use of also ; and dexterously catching that gentleman one day in his summer-house, aster he had devoted many hours to solitary pleasures, and was arousing from a prolonged slumber, she was determined to sound him as to the wedding portion her darling Louise was likely to receive in case of her marriage with her son. Poor Mynheer, startled as though he had seen a vision, was some time before he could be made to understand the object of Madame's visit. Beginning very cautiously, she expatiated upon the goodness and beauty of his charming daughter, which the taciturn merchant Us-"], [284, "276 LOST FOOTSTEPS. tened to, and acquiesced in with an occasional nod. Then Madame went on to suggest the prospect of her one day being sought in mar riage, and leaving the parental home. It was a good stroke of Madame Morel. The melancholy aspect of Mynheer, when he had thoroughly got this idea into his mind, was impressive to the last degree. Striking while the hon was hot, Madame suggested at this point, what a fortunate cir cumstance it would be U Louise should marry in her own circle, and Mynheer brightened at once. A smUe of almost infantine deUght rewarded her diplomacy, and thus encouraged, Madame hinted, with much delicacy, that her dear papa would, under such chcumstances, probably act with greater liberahty with regard to marriage settlements. \" In fact, dear Mynheer, with such a charming daughter, I can weU understand how hard it must be to part from her, and when there is a circle near at hand, where your darhng Louise"], [285, "Adrian's return. 277 woidd be at once received upon the most affec tionate footing, and never feel the loss of the home she had left, I am sure that no sacrifice would be too great.\" Poor Mynheer Kalm could only discover from aU this, that Madame Morel proposed to deprive him of his beloved daughter, and he looked as bewUdered as a chUd who is suddenly bereft of a new toy. \" Sweet Louise,\" continued Madame, \" cannot fad to win friends and admirers everywhere. Her beauty and talent, her genial disposition, and cheerfulness, are all so captivating that you must sometimes, I'm sure, Mynheer, feel very sad at the idea of her marrying.\" Madame was very much mistaken tf she imagined that Mynheer had ever thought of such a thing. \" You must be aware, Mynheer, that my dear GuUlaume has felt for MademoiseUe the deepest affection since the first day he became acquainted with her. He is only too anxious to devote his Use and fortune to her, and craves but the most"], [286, "278 LOST FOOTSTEPS. modest dowry in return. I feel sure, Mynheer, that your consent will not be witheld.\" The extreme rigidity of Mynheer's face when Madame approached financial matters, made her for the moment fear that she had gone too far. That gentleman, however, was only revolving an idea, and having steadUy and cautiously taken out his pocket book, tore off the corner of a leaf without speaking a sentence, and writing some figures thereupon, handed it to the lady. An instant more, and the conference was over, and Mynheer was in the land of dreams. i Madame had gained her point, however, and the figures scrawled by the worthy merchant were of sufficient importance to make her eyes sparkle with excitement. She knew enough of the character of Louise to be aware that it would not be well for her to be discovered in communication with her father, and had there fore provided herseU with a boat, so as to leave by way of the canal, in case of a surprise. Louise was fortunately away from home,"], [287, "Adrian's return. 279 and her enterprise, conducted with promptitude and carried out with determination, had been thoroughly successful. As to Mynheer Kalm, it was pretty certain he would never mention this visit to Louise. From that time the energy of Madame Morel was irresistible. Fetes were given at the chateau. Guillaume was sent over to Louise almost daily upon some errand or other. Presents, of the most costly description, arrived for the young beauty, and music and singing awoke Mynheer at unearthly hours of the night. In some of these pastimes Adrian occasionally joined, for he was too proud to allow the Morels to see that he had met with a repulse, although Madame Morel guessed it readily enough and showed a lurking sense of triumph thereat, which Adrian under stood and which did not increase his affection for her. It was some satisfaction to Louise that Adrian did not appear (outwardly, at least) deeply wounded by the manner in which he had been treated. She would have been astonished, indeed,"], [288, "280 LOST FOOTSTEPS. could she have known what bitterness fiUed his heart when alone. Nothing was farther from her intention than to give unnecessary pain, and the knowledge of his anguish might have changed the whole course of events. But the young artist found it impossible to stay there and watch, day by day, the closer intimacy which was springing up with the Morels, and he came to the conclusion that it would be better for him at once to leave Rotterdam. Neither the place itseU nor the occupation he had foUowed had any further interest for him. He would either emigrate and try his fortune in some new country, or else go quietly back to England and foUow out his artistic career, for which he felt much the most fitted. He avoided any formal leave-taking with Louise, and merely stated to her father that he felt the occupation was unsuited to him, and would prefer going back to his former profession. Mynheer Kalm's surprise was so profound that he dropped his meerschaum and smashed it into a thousand fragments; and Kloots, who had become"], [289, "Adrian's return. 281 very partial to Adrian, was compeUed to take sundry brimming glasses to subdue his emotion when he heard the news. \" I know,\" said Kloots, \" that Mynheer felt like a father toward you.

When he reached Molton once more, and saw the twinkling lights in the cottages, the homeliness of the scene, and the remembrance of happy days spent there, and true affection which he had but ungraciously returned, touched him keenly and made him regret more than ever the pain he had caused.

He was almost upon the point of going away again, thinking whether it would not be better to stay at the inn for the night and visit them in the morning when he was more composed, when he heard the famiUar creaking of the haU-door, which was opened by Mrs. Crankley. It was the old lady's custom to walk round the garden every night before putting up the shutters and bars, for Maude was so extremely forgetful, that something was sure to be left out-of-doors aU night but for Mrs. Crankley's watchfulness. \" I wonder what it will be to-night,\" said the dame, muttering to herseU ; \" yesterday I found her box of colours under the pear-tree, and the night before her mantle hanging upon the rose bush, and the kitten sleeping in her muff upon the lawn \u2014 it's reaUy too bad. \u2014 Gracious goodness, Mr. Adrian ! \u2014 how you startled me, to be sure How came you here at this time of night ? \u2014 but I'm glad to see you, sir, very glad \u2014 you'U find them all indoors, sir.\""], [291, "Adrian's return. 283 StiU Adrian hesitated. \" They are aU well, Mrs. Crankley ?\" \" All well, sir, thank the Lord.\" \" And Mr. Martin Hope is here, also ?\" He could not bring himseU to say, \" father.\" The word was so strange \u2014 so new. \" Your father\" (laying a slight stress upon the word) is there, too, sh, and a dear kind gentleman he is, and only wishing your return to be com pletely happy.
