Mr. Marsh had left behind him a less social party than he thought. The fact is, neither gentleman was satisfied with the pre sence or the objects of the other. Having met for the first time the previous day, each was anxious to learn the degree of intimacy existing between Mr. Marsh's family and his new acquaintance, without at the same time revealing his own anxiety. Each had an uncomfortable fear lest the magnet which drew him thither should pos sess like attractions for his neighbour, and VOL.

Consequently, the \u2022 conversation was dull and vapid in the extreme, consisting of little more than common-place remarks on the weather, the season, the party of the pre ceding day, and a few anecdotes connected with Edwin's hospital career elicited by an inquiry of Eva's. \" I presume Captain Hesketh will have joined his ship by this time ? \" .observed, or rather asked Frank, during one of the frequent pauses. \" Oh dear, no ! \" responded Eva, readdy ; \" Cuthbert will not be more than half way to Leamside yet. He has been here all the morning, and unless Martin drives very rapidly I expect he will miss the train.\" \" That must be a very powerful attraction which could keep Captain Hesketh away from his ship when duty caded him hence,\" said Mr. Raeburn, lightly but pointedly,"], [13, "3 REPOSE. glancing from Eva to Rhoda as he spoke, as if to glean which was \" the attraction \" from their faces. Rhoda feeling no emotion, betrayed none ; but Eva, conscious that Cuthbert had dal lied by Rhoda's side, forgetful of his alle giance to Mary, and yet unwilling to impli cate her cousin by saying so, looked both annoyed and confused. Frank noted the sign, on which he put his own construction, and pressed his close lips closer, at the same time spoiling a new kid glove with ineffaceable impressions of his finger-ends upon the palm. The quarrel of the previous day, Edwin Grove had persuaded himself, was a sufficient pretext for a transfer of his attentions from Miss Hesketh to whomsoever he would, for the time being ; and should he see fit, after further consideration, it was a firm basis for the nullification of their engagement alto gether. During his probationary sojourn in the metropolis he had learned many things be- B 2"], [14, "4 STUNG TO THE QUICK. side medicine, and a flirtation more or less imported little. At that present moment, he was fascinated by Miss Wearbank, and Cuthbert's atten tions in the same quarter having attracted his notice, he was as ready to observe the effect of Mr. Raeburn's remark as was that o-entleman himself. \" The coast's clear in that quarter, at all events,\" thought he, as he watched Rhoda's impassive face ; \" I wish I only knew what this other fellow means. I've a notion he's after one of the girls, and I should like to find out which, for hang me if I can tell. Perhaps he's only a friend after ad. But no, no ; he did not throw out that sly hint for nothing. However, I'm not afraid of him, or his moustache either, and if he comes in my way it wdl be him or me for it, that's all.\" Such were the rapid thoughts which chased each other through Edwin Grove's brain, as he pulled his gloves on and off two or three times, undetermined whether to go or stay, conscious he had remained an unrea-"], [15, "5 REPOSE. sonable time, but equady reluctant to resign the ground to the very elegant gentleman before him. As a tangible excuse to prolong his visit, he begged that Miss Wearbank would favour them with a view of the sketch she had made at Finchale the day before. Rhoda's colour was under command. A host of disagreeable recollections crowded round her heart and clouded her brow at this reminder ; but the cloud passed from her aspect as rapidly as it came, and she lightly affected to depreciate the power of her pencil. \" Permit us to judge of that, Miss Wear bank,\" said Mr. Raeburn, with a polite incli nation of his head. \" I assure you, Mr. Raeburn, Miss Wear bank has the touch of an artist. T saw that in the glimpse with which I was favoured yesterday. Do, Miss Wearbank, oblige us all with a glance at your drawings, even if you reserve the one in question for the friend to whom it was dedicated,\" said Edwin, turning to her entreatingly."], [16, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. Rhoda hesitated, anxious to display to Mr. Raeburn a talent with which he was yet unacquainted, and quite as desirous to avoid rather the appearance of display, or too much readiness to oblige Mr. Grove. \" Now, Rhoda, do bring your portfolio down, or let me run for it, there's a dear girl. You know that your sketches are exquisite, and why should you refuse to show them 1 I only wish I had any half as good to exhibit. Your houses and trees never stoop to prop each other up, as mine do ; nor have any of your animals the slightest trace of an antediluvian classification. You need not be ashamed of your drawings, so let me pr> for them.\" Apparently moved by Eva's urgent en treaty, Rhoda consented, and left the room, ostensibly for the purpose, but, in truth, to remove from her portfolio a portrait of Frank Raeburn, not intended for general inspection. During her brief absence, Eva commented on the beauty of her cousin's drawings in"], [17, "7 REPOSE. glowing terms of genuine admiration ; and while Edwin Grove listened, and thought so much talent worth some trouble to win, Frank Raeburn hoped and trusted so much artlessness and generosity would not fall to the lot of a rough sailor like Cuthbert, in capable, as he must be, of appreciating their worth. It was a triumph to Rhoda to read the admiration of Mr. Raeburn in his eyes, as wTed as hear it from his lips, to say nothing of the open encomiums of Edwin Grove. Would she have been satisfied with her triumph, could she have known the restraint put upon Frank's right arm, lest it should clasp involuntarily the fair girl at his side, busied in selecting for his inspection the sketches or paintings she herself deemed worthiest of praise ? Rhoda herself made fight of the wdiole, treating them as the mere amusement of an idle hour, though she knew in her secret heart she had devoted herself most assidu ously to the cultivation of every talent or"], [18, "8 STUNG TO THE QUICK. power she possessed, and that industry and energy combined had made her what she was, as artist and musician both. Mr. Raeburn, suddenly recalling an ap pointment with Mr. Hesketh, drew his watch from a side-pocket (not the unfashionable tob), and, with a hasty apology alike for his abrupt departure and his lengthy visit, retired, leaving Edwin Grove behind to rejoice in having out-generaded him. Soon, he, too, thought proper to depart, and then the two weary girls looked for repose. Both were fatigued with the exer tion consequent on the entertainment of a number of guests \u2014 with the dancing and late hours. To Rhoda's weariness wras superadded a sleepless night of agony, and the super human effort required to sustain a disguise, for the requirement of which she was unpre pared. The drawings were barely replaced in the portfolio when Bella entered to lay the dinner-cloth, and Mr. Marsh, with his ac-"], [19, "REPOSE. 9 customed punctuality, opened the street door. There was no repose now until the cloth was withdrawn, when Mr. Marsh took his pipe into the garden, and had his forty winks on a rustic seat under the shade of a patri archal pear-tree. Rhoda and Eva then retired also, the latter to puzzle herself on her pidow (her fair face lost in a maze of flaxen curls) whether Mr. Raeburn thought most of herself or Rhoda, or whether he cared anything in particular for either, and in the midst of her puzzle she fell asleep, to dream all sorts of impossible and improbable things, in which Frank and Rhoda mingled in strange confusion. Rhoda retired for repose, but repose with her did not mean a siesta. She would have been thankful for the oblivion of sleep, but, with her mind in a whirl, sleep was an im possibility. She required repose, but it wTas the repose of solitude,\u2014 and at length she had it. Bolting herself in her room, she began to"], [20, "10 STUNG TO THE QUICK. pace it hurriedly, with her hands clasped tightly over the knot of her back hair, and as her thoughts ran riot, her eyes ddated, or her face pinched with pain, and her step varied with her mood. But the vehemence wore itself out. With water, cold as the season afforded, she bathed her hot head copiously, with no fear of ex citing observation by lank tresses, since hers, wet or dry, curled with almost Creole crisp ness. Then she traversed her room again, with her hands still tightly clenched, not above her head, but this time down before her, and her step was slowT and measured. The whirlwind wras past, and she en deavouring to repair the ravages of the storm. Slowly she trod the floor, deliberating and considering, as one so young should never consider or deliberate ; and, having resolved to hurl defiance at those who had braved and outfaced her, set herself to plot how she could most securely and unsuspectedly wreak her vengeance on the Heskeths and"], [21, "REPOSE. 11 secure Mr. Raeburn for herself at the same time. The two seemed almost incompatible, yet she determined to accomplish both. Cuth bert was gone ; she could devote the whole of her energies to the enslaving of Frank ; true, she had made slow progress hitherto, but she had read love and admiration in the look that kindled at her drawings. (Ah, Rhoda, could you but have known that all the love, and much of the admiration your keen eye discerned, was for the single minded, unaffected cousin, whose charms and attainments you held in such contempt ?) As for that self-sufficient fool, Edwin Grove, wTho had quarrelled with his sweatheart in her hearing, and was decidedly smitten with herself, she would just keep him dangling until the breach was beyond repair; and perchance it might suit her to palm him upon Eva. She would think of it. Thus, with the world at her feet, and in her web, she thought herself into compla cency ; and throwing her wreary body on a"], [22, "12 STUNG TO THE QUICK. sofa in her room, fell into a sound, heavy sleep, from which Bella, knocking at the bolted door, had much difficulty to arouse her wdien tea-time came."], [23, "CHAPTER II. BELOW THE SURFACE. Mr. Raeburn had few friends in Durham, those he had being principally the associates of his late uncle, and consequently elder than himself. The seclusion of his father's life had, as a natural consequence, isolated him from youthful society until his habits and tastes were in a manner formed ; and though there was no want of sociality in his composition, he was chary of forming fresh acquaintances. His distinguished personal appearance, not less than his position as a landowner in the county, had rendered him an object both of admiration and specula tion, and being voted \" an eligible match,\" invitations poured in upon him from all"], [24, "14 STUNG TO THE QUICK. quarters, a very flimsy pretext serving for an introduction. On most of those professing to be old friends of his father or uncle he called, it is true, but seldom repeated the visit of cere mony, excusing himself on the ground that, untd he had decided on his own abode,, and could reciprocate hospitality, he must decline visiting, a reply which tended not only to check intrusion, but to whet the edge of curiosity : whilst it offended no one, since it wras given to all alike. Dr. Grove and his uncle had been codege chums, Mr. Hesketh confidential agent of both father and uncle, and Mr. Marsh a dear friend of the latter. But of the three, Mr. Marsh was the only one hitherto visited, \u2014 a fact commented on by all the disappointed belles and dames cognisant of the circumstance. So Mr. Raeburn was stigmatised as haughtv and purse-proud in one quarter, as conceited and vain in another, as reserved and morose, or weak and credulous in others, according"], [25, "BELOW THE SURFACE. 15 to the phase of his life and manner under review, or the special point of observation. Amongst the speculations rife were won ders what he could find so interesting at the Marshes, and expectations that if he were making love to that Miss Wearbank he would be finely disappointed when he found she was nobody after all. That Mrs. Hesketh and her clique were the only ones indulging in these remarks it would not be fair to say, but that they were in particular favour with her intimates is indubitable ; these wiseacres overlooking the fact that there was a second, and scarcely less attractive young lady in the same house, or the possibility that a young gentleman might visit a middle-aged one without any ulterior object. Gladly would Mrs. Hesketh have ignored her daughter's engagement with young Mr. Grove, could she have substituted one with Mr. Raeburn. And hot had been the war between the surveyor and his less scrupulous wife, because he stoutly refused her the"], [26, "16 STUNG TO THE QUICK. chance of making a dead set at the wealthy new-comer, by inviting him under their roof. Therefore, when he reached Mr. Hesketh's office that day, somewhat later than his appointment, and, after a very cursory refer ence to the plan on the table, received and accepted an invitation to dine with his trust worthy agent, the arrangement was a mere matter of business, not ceremony. The lease of a colliery on Mr. Raeburn's property would lapse shortly, and the subject of discussion was whether he should thence forth work the pit himself, or renew the lease to the present occupiers. For the uninter rupted discussion of this question he accepted the invitation given by Mr. Hesketh, given with the threefold motive \u2014 of business, the assertion of mastership at home, and a curb on the tongue of the deposed matron. Mr. Raeburn knew nothing of domestic differences, nothing of the feminine schemes for his hand and lands, nothing of the absent ladies, whose loss he did not regret, since the"], [27, "17 BELOW THE SURFACE. matter in hand wras discussed more freely without them, whilst to the husband and father it was a decided relief. But when Mrs. Hesketh heard of the visit \u2014 not from Mr. Hesketh, not from Betty, but from Mrs. Coulson \u2014 then were her rage and disappointment at fever height ; in striving to defeat and mortify her husband, she had only defeated and mortified herself; her temper rose with her vexation, and termi nated as usual with a shower of tears. In the struggle for the gentleman's nether garments which followed, and before that gentleman's excellent sister was brought upon the scene, Lucy was almost entirely overlooked by the contending parties. Judg ing from externals, and from his experience of her mother, Mr. Hesketh had a belief that \" like mother like daughter,\" and that Lucy had no heart to be wounded, even though Edwin Grove (whose prolonged absence he could not fail to note) did break faith with her. There, however, he was mistaken. Lucy VOL. II. 0"], [28, "18 STUNG TO THE QUICK. had a heart, such as it was \u2014 a heart which different cultivation might have developed to much better purpose ; but the mother's blood, the mother's milk, and the mother's training had gone to repress those germs of kindliness and affection which might other wise have linked her with the paternal side. What little affection she had was given to Edwin Grove, as girls give their hearts, with out thought or consideration ; but vanity and selfishness occupied so very large a por tion of that very little heart, that what she did give away was not much worth either giving or having. As Rhoda had remarked to Mr. Marsh, beaux were not very plentiful in Durham, and the flattered vanity of having a lover, and being engaged, wdien so many of her companions Avere dying of envy of her good fortune, was a large component of her love for Edwin. Now, however, that he had deserted her, so palpably deserted her too, for a girl who had been her rival at school \u2014 a girl without"], [29, "BELOW THE SURFACE. 19 a penny \u2014 a girl, who came no one knew whence, her mortification was extreme ; she was wounded in her sorest point ; her friends would laugh at her, and that they did was beyond a doubt ; but, in spite of vanity, Edwin Grove had a place in her heart, even though he shared it with much lumber ; and she fretted after him in her own peculiar fashion. That peculiar fashion was, to cry pettishly in her own room, and bite her finger-nails, then bathe her face, put on her best bonnet and her best smiles, and saunter out to make herself as wretched as possible by throwing herself in his way, just to show her perfect indifference. On his part, he had been not a little at a loss how to excuse his appearance in Dur ham and at a pic-nic, without any previous announcement of his home-coming or a pre liminary visit to his liege lady. Having at first taken the high vantage ground of indig nation at the company in which he found her \u2014 namely, that of Jack Fortescue and c 2"], [30, "20 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Mr. Lighthead, \u2014 and not knowing how to descend gracefudy, he preserved his demea nour and his distance, moved thereto, in a great measure, by the lever in South Street. As the days wTore into weeks, Rhoda's tact completed the estrangement her dangerous beauty had shadowed forth. When he met Lucy in the market-place, or on the narrow bridge-paths, or on the promenade by the river-side, he would raise his hat and pass her with so courteous and distant an inclination of the head, that the cut was more severe and stinging than if he had taken no notice of her wdiatever. Every time they met the pain wras greater, yet she could not restrain her feet from wan dering wdiere she met the pain. At length, in a passion of wounded vanity and feeling she sent back all his letters, together with the turquoise forget-me-not ring which she wore as a token of their troth, requesting a corresponding return, since her letters could have no further value for him. This was not exactly what he had expected,"], [31, "BELOW THE SURFACE. 21 and it took him aback. He was not so utterly confounded by Rhoda's bright eyes as to lose sight of his boyish flame ad at once, and felt himself very much of a culprit. There was however in Lucy's letter no appeal to old memories or to his better feel ings, no remonstrance, no reproach, but a taunt and a sneer throughout. In the former case he would most likely have taken the ring and letters back, and patched up a peace, but the taunt put him on his mettle, and he took time to consider his answer. To do that more effectually he sauntered up to Marsh's. Mr. Raeburn being just then away in London, Rhoda was more irresistibly fascinating and condescending than usual. The next evening, and the next, found him on the same spot, deferring the return of Lucy's letters, undecided whether to accept her resignation or not ; but, just as the term of his vacation expired, a second letter, ac cusing him of a dishonourable motive in retaining her billets, roused him into action ;"], [32, "22 STUNG TO THE QUICK. he accepted the challenge, and returned them \u2014 a curl of tawny hair peeping out of one, with a suggestiveness of old associations, which he would even then have recalled but for petty pride. She had accused him of a dishonourable motive in keeping her letters, thereupon the unimpeachable gentleman bristled up in in dignation, and to show that he wTas not dis honourable sent them back, and so broke faith, which of course wras not dishonour able. In two or three days he went to London, carrying with him the sketch Rhoda had made under his eye at Finchale. This he hung in his room, which served him for chamber and parlour and all, ousting from a rosewood frame a group of flowers in oriental tinting from Lucy's school fingers, in order to make way for the newer and certainly more artis tic production. Cuthbert was gone, and Edwin Grove was gone ; Rhoda had done what damage to both their hearts she could, had moreover sue-"], [33, "23 BELOW THE SURFACE. ceeded in separating both pair of lovers very unsuspectedly ; and now she had leisure to devote to the enslaving of Frank Raeburn. To this end she bent every energy of her strong mind and strong wdl. But she made very slow progress ; he seemed proof against her blandishments. In vain she changed \" from grave to gay, from lively to severe,\" his mood was still the same. If she courted flattery he gave it freely, but no device of hers could entrap him into warmth of manner or expression towards her ; and though she watched his move ments like a lynx \u2014 never left Eva alone with him for an instant \u2014 shared all excursions \u2014 she equally failed to detect any latent regard for her cousin ; and week after week roded by, yet her aim was unaccomplished, and Mr. Raeburn remained to her impenetrable as the sphynx \u2014 cold as an iceberg. Remembering his admiration of her draw ings, she would lure Eva awav with her into the country or down by the river side, while"], [34, "24 STUNG TO THE QUICK. she made sketches of old barns, byres, and wayside cottages, or as the season ad vanced, with her crayons limned the chang ing hues of sun-struck foliage. She was always careful to leave word at home which direction they should take, and so it fell out that not unfrequently Mr. Raeburn met them on their homeward path, or joined the fair artist and her companion by the river side, when he often wandered whether Miss Wearbank or her picture was the most picturesque. Rhoda was always \" surprised\" to see him when he came, but Eva began to look for his appearance as a natural result of a stroll with pencils and portfolio, and looked for it with almost as much pain as pleasure, so naturally did her cousin appropriate the little services, attentions, or compliments of their cavalier. The merry laugh was seldom heard from Eva's lips, a shade of thought settled on her face, the dancing step lost its elas ticity.

At least this was the reason she assigned when Mr. Raeburn said to her one day \u2014 \" You are very serious over your work, Miss Marsh ; I have not seen the colour of your eyes this afternoon.\" He saw, however, the rising colour in her cheeks, when she replied, without raising her head, \" I should make mistakes if I looked up often.\" \" But is your work of so much importance you require to bring it with you, when it may prevent the enjoyment of a sunset and scenery such as this ? \" \" Oh ! Eva does not care for scenery or sunsets,\" put in Rhoda, carelessly, without looking round from her drawing. \" I hope that is not true, Miss Marsh ? \" said the gentleman, enquiringly. \" Indeed it is not, Mr. Raeburn ; but it is very dull to sit here for hours doing nothing, and very unsocial to bring a book, so I"], [36, "26 STUNG TO THE QUICK. string my work instead, because I can chat over that.\" \"It would not be unsocial were you to read aloud to Miss Wearbank wlrdst she sketched.\" A slight shrug of Rhoda's shoulders was just perceptible to Mr. Raeburn's observant eyes, but she made no other remark. Eva, on the contrary, with a bright smde, said, apologetically \u2014 \" Ah, but I read so very indifferently and monotonously, Rhoda does not care to hear me.\" y> \" If that is so, it indeed alters the case, and I can understand why you prefer work,\" assented he, having mentally connected the admission with the shrug, though dubious of its verity, nevertheless. \" And what do you do with these fairy chains when you have made them? You cannot wear them all yourself.\" \"Oh no! I give them to my friends. One my father wears, another I gave to Mr. Hesketh, and \""], [37, "27 BELOW THE SURFACE. \" One to Captain Hesketh, you remember, Eva,\" insinuated Rhoda, as if refreshing a treacherous memory. \"Yes, and one to Cuthbert ; and this \u2014 Mr. Raeburn had been playing with the dangling end of the unfinished braidwork ; he dropped it like a live coal at the name of Captain Hesketh, but Eva's frank assent and the hesitating \" and this \" wdiich followed, banished a hasty suspicion he had formed, and prompted him to say \u2014 \"And this, Miss Marsh, I should be proud to possess if you have not already a claimant for it.\" \" I was making it for you, only I was afraid you would scarcely think it worth wearing.\" \" Worth wearing ! \" They were only two words, in tone too low to catch Rhoda's anxious ears, but the look which accompanied them caused Eva to bend once more the head she had raised in offering her handiwork.

Nor Avas Rhoda, Avho pondered the depth and import of the Ioav words she could not distinguish, much more disposed to be loquacious. As each, however, became conscious of unwonted taciturnity, each made sudden dashes at conversation, Avhich lapsed into failure for lack of support. At Mr. Marsh's door, Mr. Raeburn would have boAved himself off, but he had been seen from the AvindoAv, and Mr. Marsh's cheery voice was heard calling him back. \" I say, Frank ! you are not going off in that way.

Not only Eva, but Mr. Raeburn, looked their thanks as the Doctor spoke, and Rhoda acquiesced in the truth of his observation with a ready frankness Avhich deceived ad but the shreAvd old man. Relieved from the suggestion of Cuthbert's secret influence, Mr. Raeburn looked over the drawings Avith a new pleasure, pointing out a defect here, a beauty there, ending Avith an encouragement to resume her pencil and an offer to assist her advancement by occasional suggestions. He did not say instructions, but it Avas inferred ; and Rhoda, gathering up her pro ductions in superb disdain, carried them from the room, only to stamp with vexation on the floor of her chamber, and call herself and all concerned \" a parcel of idiots.\" As Mr. Raeburn Avent home that night, he codected the dust Rhoda had thrown into his eyes, and examined it by the glass Dr. Grove had lent him.

Mr. Raeburn often dropped in to give the promised \" suggestions,\" and at such times Eva would gloAV with animation. After a time, Rhoda suddenly discovered she had something yet to learn, and so sweetly and seductively referred to him all questions on perspective, lights or shadoAvs, that poor Eva's gleam of sunshine faded in twilight. Early in November came Eva's birthday, and with it presents and letters of congratu lation from many friends. Gloves, buckles, belts, books, and a small pyramid of silver thimbles Avere ranged before her when Mr. Marsh and Mr. Raeburn came in together, and the latter placed a parcel in her hand, Avith a low-voiced birthday Avish which haunted her for many a day.

From that November day, Rhoda wratched the tAvain with eyes sharpened by jealous fear, and by every art, strove not only to gain an ascendency over Mr. Raeburn, but to destroy any germs of hope budding in her cousin's heart.

Across this gloom came glimpses of sun shine. Released from his thraldom he would seat himself near her and speak of things in Avhich he kneAv her to be interested.

Something told him he was loved ; but Rhoda had kept the Captain so constantly dinning in his ears, he felt dimly apprehen sive he might be mistaken.

In the solitude of her own chamber she unclasped the bracelets from her slender arms and viewed them with SAvimming eyes. Surely he would not have asked her to wear them for his sake unless she Avere in deed \" dear\" to him. Oh ! what a delicious thought was that ! But, what if these wrere only complimentary words, and he had said as much to her cousin ? A sigh folloAved the thought, and the Avorn look, so common to her of late, settled on her young face ; but it passed away as Frank's tones recurred to her memory, and she unclosed her priceless \" Lalla Rookh\" to read in bed for half an hour, and dream of the giver afterwards. Under the enchanted influence of the book and bracelets she brightened so wonderfully, that Dr. Grove, with comical look and half closed eyes, asked a feAV days later \u2014 \" Have you taken any medicine besides that of my prescription, Miss Eva ? \" VOL.

The heavy crimson curtains were drawn close, and Rhoda, as was her wont, stood behind them, looking out on the stream and the sky, revolving the ceaseless question in her mind, \" Does he love me, or does he not ?\" Suddenly the door opened. Mr. Raeburn stepped in, and came briskly forward to ex change greetings Avith Eva. \" Dear Eva, I am so delighted to find you alone ! \" The listener held her breath. \" But where is Miss Wearbank ?\" \"I thought she was in the room,\" said Eva, looking round ; \" she must have gone to change her dress ; she has been out.\" \" If you have no objection, Eva, I wifl seat myself beside you.

See if there is no other you Avould like as Avell, Mr. Raeburn,\" and her voice trembled strangely as she spoke. \" No other ; I desire no other,\" yet mecha nically he turned over the leaves. At length, Avith a slight start, he snatched one from the book, which dropped unheeded to the floor, and exclaimed \u2014 \" Yes, Eva, I Avid take this one, with your permission. Dear, dear Eva, may I have this ? \" And he pressed the bit of card-board to his lips. It bore the two words, \" Eva Marsh.\" \" You may have both\" Avas her reply, as she buried her burning face in her hands. \" God bless you, my oaatii darling EA^a !

And there they sat together for some time, absorbed in thought, with now and then a whispered Avord of endearment, a closer pres sure of the form he held, or a gentle kiss on her warm lips to ted how blest they Avere. And what of Rhoda ? did she faint or scream ? Neither: she clutched the Avindow-frame for support, but soon greAV rigid as a statue. She heard ad \u2014 ad \u2014 low as were the tones \u2014 heard with agony of spirit indescribable, yet could not stir. At last rousing herself by a strong effort, she glided stealthily from the room, and was seen no more that night.

I saw you first at Leamside, and lost my heart at once. I should have revealed my love long ago, but could never find you alone. Rhoda was like a duenna, e\\'er by your side. I did not dare to hope for this glorious opportunity when Martin let me in. My Eva \u2014 mine.\" Shortly he resumed, \" You have your bracelets on.

I shall, in deed, wear it for your sake now.\" \" I have hitherto felt a secret joy, Eva, that you wore it, e\\ren though uncon sciously.\" And then he told her how apprehensive"], [66, "56 STUNG TO THE QUICK. he had been lest she had given her heart into the keeping of Cuthbert, howT much pain the supposition had caused him, how often he had determined to know the wrorst, and been defeated by the constant presence of her cousin, and hoAV a casual remark of Dr. Grove's had partially dissipated his jealous fears, and made him hopeful for himself. This confession was interrupted at the outset by a merry little laugh from Eva, wdio evidently regarded the bare supposition of her being in loAre Avith Cuthbert as some thing irresistibly comical. He was soon in possession of the knowT ledge that the captain was engaged to Mary Reed ; information accompanied by a ATery flattering description of Mary herself, end ing with, \" She is as industrious, steady and amiable a girl as you could meet with anywhere.\" \" I wonder if she is as amiable as you are generous in your praise, Eva,\" exclaimed he, with a look of admiration."], [67, "BEHIND THE CURTAINS. 57 \" Generous ! there is no generosity about it ; I only spoke the truth.\" \" Young ladies are not always generous enough to speak truth of each other, darling.\" \" Ah, Frank, now you are ungenerous.\" \" Am I ? well, we will not dispute about it : perhaps I am.\" And with a smile he pressed closer the little hand resting so con fidingly in his. Thus on that New Year's eve they sat to gether until Mr. Marsh came in, when Mr. Eaeburn said that he wished to solicit from Mr. Marsh a New Year's gift of his own selection. \" I make no blind promises, young gentle man, but I am not very inaccessible. Do you know what he wants, Eva ? \" \" Nay, Mr. Marsh, do not ask her. It is your Eva I would beg of you.\" \" I thought as much. I saw what was coming under the mistletoe on Christmas Eve.

She had a nervous headache and must be quiet, she said. Quiet ! Her brain was in a ferment. All night she had paced about her chamber in frantic agony, with both hands clasped behind her head, chafing like a caged lion, and muttering thoughts that lashed her wild rage to frenzy. \" And this is the end of all my passionate love, all my wild hopes of happiness Avith him !

There were dark circles around her eyes, when she came down to breakfast, that second of January, the result, it is presumed, of the intense headache ; of the more intense heartache no one had a suspicion. Her smile, it is true, was somewhat languid ; but when acquainted by Mr. Marsh with Eva's betrothal to the \"bumpkin,\" her congratu-"], [70, "60 STUNG TO THE QUICK. lations were as warm as though she meant them, and her surprise as manifest as though the crimson curtains had never concealed a listener."], [71, "CHAPTER IV. THE CAPTAIN OF THE \"POLLY.\" The Captain of a sailing vessel has plenty of time for reflection in the course of a long voyage, and as Cuthbert sat in his cabin or paced the deck, watching his barque rise or dip with the heavy rollers of the broad Atlantic, memory was busy in his brain, and conscience stalked beside him like his shadow. King of his craft, he was isolated above the companionship of his subjects. His crew might laugh and sing and jest among themselves to wile away the time or dismiss obtrusive thought ; but there was no such Lethe for him, especially as he had no undue leaning towards the oblivion of the rum-cask."], [72, "62 STUNG TO THE QUICK. In his cabin hung a miniature of Mary, painted two or three years before by a travelling artist, of which the most to be said was that it resembled the original. This he had been wont to contemplate in all his softer moods with as much of vene ration as love. As he had often told Mary, that picture had been a restraint upon him in many an hour of temptation, a comfort in many a trial. If a skulking lubber amongst his crew urged him to a fit of unmanly passion ; if a sense of irresponsi bility left him free to be harsh, overbearing, unjust, or cruel, and a less scrupulous mate at his elbow suggested that a little wrong might be a great right, or that it was his duty to punish, a glance at the mild face on his wooden wall would remind him that it was his duty to do unto others as he would they should do unto him ; and that reflec tion served to soften many a tone of asperity, many an act of reprisal. Little as the seamen under his command knew it, they, in a great measure, owed"], [73, "THE CAPTAIN OF THE \"POLLY.\" 63 to that ill-painted portrait the kindness and consideration with which they were treated. A temper, naturally hasty and impetuous, roughing it at sea amongst men whose mildest form of speech was an oath, under a captain who made kicks serve him for words, might have developed into coarseness and ferocity, and, but for the influence of the gentle girl who had been more than a sister to him, would have done so. Mary's childish sympathy, consolations, and counsels, had upheld the sinking heart of the boy, and as she grew to womanhood their influence deepened. She had served to preserve his humanity, and when he emerged from the last gradation of obedi ence and stepped on the deck of the \" Polly,\" master of barque and crew, he carried that picture with him as an amulet, unwittingly. In the bustle of harbour duties, the stowage of cargo late on board, the clearing out from the labyrinth of vessels already in dock or"], [74, "64 STUNG TO THE QUICK. coming into port, whilst weathering the rough gales which swept the North Sea, keeping captain and crew alike on the alert, whilst meeting and breasting the channel currents, he had little leisure to spare for home thought, and if the picture caught his eye by chance, he turned away from that which seemed to look a reproach. Once in the open ocean, every breeze that shook the sails or murmured through the shrouds, seemed to repeat the word \" un canny.\" The black eyes whose witchery haunted him on shore, dimmed and faded out before the mild hazel ones limned there before him. Gradually repentance came, and the next vessel they spoke bore a line of penitence to his placable Mary. This was followed by a longer letter from Bahia. The former went down to the yellow haired mermaidens under the sea, as many a letter of love or duty had gone before, but the latter reached Sunderland safely, and prepared Mary to receive her truant with"], [75, "THE CAPTAIN OF THE \" POLLY.\" 65 a smile of welcome, when he followed it, a month or six weeks later. In the interim, and shortly after Cuth bert's departure, while the tears still flowed down Mary's cheeks, at the thought of their angry partmg, of a quarrel which wind and wave might make eternal, ere the gray sails of the \" Polly \" were lost to her straining sight, watching the distant horizon from the South pier, the postman delivered to the Rev. James Reed, in her absence, a letter, of which the following is a tran script : \u2014 \" Reverend Sir, \" In the purest of motives I write to warn you of that two-faced scoundrel, Cuth bert Hesketh, who is only following your daughter to make a fool of her. \" I think it only my duty to let you know that he is dangling after Mr. Marsh's niece, and that Mr. Marsh, Avho ought to be ashamed of himself, encourages him.

I should like to wring her ears, whoever she is.\" Though a mild and forbearing clergyman, a very charitable and excellent sample of the cloth, he was a man capable of human indignation and fatherly feeling ; and was not the wish natural ? Beyond that little ebullition of just resent ment, nothing more was heard of the anony mous scrawl, the joint production of Coulson and Hesketh genius."], [77, "THE CAPTAIN OF THE \" POLLY.\" 67 The shaft, therefore, fell short of the mark, and Mary, grieving for Cuthbert, had not the double mortification of believing herself slighted for another. Even Eva, in her occa sional letters, never adverted to his attention to her cousin, not thinking it anything serious and not being given to mischief making. So when Cuthbert came back, anxious to obtain forgiveness from Mary for his hasty temper (he said nothing of inconstancy), he had not to sue in vain ; she was too blest in his return to criticise the bungling apology he made for absenting himself in what he termed \" his foolish pique.\" Once more he sat in the drowsy parlour whenever he could be spared from the quay, and for three or four weeks all went on smoothly. Knowing his own weakness he avoided Durham, and urged Mary to consent to be his wife before he went to sea again. He was willing to leave her behind whilst she provided a suitable voyaging outfit against his return in the spring, when he p 2"], [78, "68 STUNG TO THE QUICK. hoped she would be prepared to sail with him. Thus, though the \" Polly\" had been in port two or three weeks, nothing had been heard or seen of Cuthbert until the afternoon of the third of January, when Mr. Raeburn met him at the Hat-and-Feathers in the Market Place, whither each of them had gone to fortify himself against the intense cold with grog, or hot brandy and water, accord ing to peculiar taste. It appeared that Cuthbert, taking Mary's half-assent for a whole one, had come over at once to acquaint his father with his in tended marriage, and to procure the neces sary licence. That important document had not been in his pocket-book half an hour when he had the misfortune to meet Mr. Raeburn, and in the gladness of his heart revealed the nature of his business in Durham. Thus doubly relieved of all fear of the Captain as a rival, Frank's heart was opened to a similar confidence. Anxious to atone"], [79, "THE CAPTAIN OF THE \" POLLY. 69 for his own suspicions, he acquainted Cuth bert with his recent engagement, and begged he would accompany him to Mr. Marsh's to pay his respect to the bride-elect. Cuthbert endeavoured to excuse himself, but Mr. Raeburn would take no denial, and the two walked thither arm-in-arm, with widely different feelings ; the one elated with confidence and hope, the other lost in doubt and fear. Cuthbert had a kind, good heart, but a very weak one, and his head was as weak ; then he was impulsive, and, though his principles were sound, he had very little strength to resist temptation. Eva bounded towards them on their en trance, giving a hand to each with a gleeful exclamation of surprise. Rhoda (still suf fering from angry headache) raised herself languidly from a pile of cushions, moved the fire-screen from before her, and also came forward to meet them.

Neither the knock at the door, nor the eager welcome, had roused Mr. Marsh, who was dozing by the fire with his long legs stretched out, and his head thrown back under cover of a China silk handkerchief, the gift of the seafaring friend then in the room. But Eva, with a kiss on the sleeper's forehead, and a pat or two on his whiskered cheek, wakened him. After a yawn and a stretch he became conscious of the visitor's presence. \" Why, Cuthbert, lad, is that you ? I'm heartily glad to see you. We thought you were having a nap on an oyster bed, you were so long in making your appearance. And how are all our good friends in Sunderland?\" said he, the grasp of the"], [81, "THE CAPTAIN OF THE \" POLLY. 71 hand expressing as much heartiness as his words. \" Oh, thank you, cheery ! that is, if you mean the Reeds.\" \" Of course I mean the Reeds.

' and that I rushed into con amove.\" \"From a love of the rushes or the lasses V asked Mr. Raeburn, quietly. \" Umph. Perhaps a little of both, Frank. But Cuthbert here contrived to love a Reed and a lass at the same time, and will marry the two some day without committing bigamy.\" Notwithstanding his bronzed complexion, Cuthbert's colour came and went during this little play upon words, flushing up into deep red at the last allusion, which, being made before Rhoda, not only smote his conscience, but made him feel remarkably foolish and look so too. So palpable was his confusion, that even"], [82, "72 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Mr. Marsh (not the most clear-sighted in such matters), observing it, exclaimed, \" Why, Cuthbert, you are blushing like a young girl. I never knew you were bashful before. You surely have not got a blacka moor wife anywhere that you startle so at the word bigamy, or a China woman with useless feet and finger-nails a foot long, eh?\" \" Not I, Mr. Marsh, I never sailed on that tack \u2014 but ' ' \" Your matrimonial pun touched the cap tain nearer home than Africa or China, my dear sir.

There, Eva is blushing now ! \""], [83, "THE CAPTAIN OF THE \" POLLY.\" 73 Rhoda had returned to her cushions, and on the first mention of the Reeds so adjusted the convenient fire-screen as to hide the face, already half-buried in the pillows, from all but Cuthbert, who stood like a culprit, near enough to catch her glances of mingled indignation and pain. There, without joining in jest or con gratulation, she reclined, grasping her hair in the hand beneath her head, alter nately biting her lips or setting her teeth as annoyance gave place to resolution, and thus ran the commentary of her thoughts : \u2014 \" Our good friends in Sunderland \u2014 Reeds, of course \u2014 I wish I could sunder them ; they are no friends of mine \u2014 I owe them no friendship \u2014 there's no love lost between Mary Reed and me.

The humming-bird and rattle-snake typify Rhoda and Cuthbert exactly. No sooner did she fix her lustrous eyes on him than their fascination held him like a spell. Able to command a ship, yet he was not able to command himself, and Rhoda soon held him in firmer bonds than be fore. Not that he forgot Mary, but the me mory became a reproach to him, and he strove to shut it out. So skilfully did Rhoda beguile him, that when he returned to Old Elvet late that night, he went, with the impression that Rhoda's illness"], [86, "76 STUNG TO THE QUICK. had been through grief at his apparent estrangement, and that her love for him was so excessive she would die if he did not return it."], [87, "CHAPTER V. DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. Here was a pretty dilemma for a brave sea-captain ! Not Hercules spinning for Omphale felt himself more contemptible than did Cuth bert, as he tossed on his bed at night, reasoning and debating with himself to no purpose. He was entangled in a web which he believed to be of his own weaving, as so in part it was, for though Rhoda had used an invisible shuttle, and plied it dexterously, she had only worked up the material his own weakness and irresolution had supplied. He had surrendered when he should have fought, loitered when he should have fled, spoken that in his folly he could not recall"], [88, "78 STUNG TO THE QUICK. in his wisdom, and the result was a state of bewilderment which defies expression. What could he do ? he was bound in love and honour to Mary, almost equally bound to Rhoda, and, what was worse, both were deeply in love with him. Mary was good, and pure, and kind \u2014 too kind for a fickle, senseless fellow like himself; but then Rhoda was so beautiful, so loving, her wondrous eyes penetrated his very soul. What could he do ? He could not leave her to die through his desertion ; and yet how could he be false to Mary \u2014 Mary who had been so forgiving ? Perhaps Rhoda was right after all, and Mary had no depth of feeling. It might be so, and Rhoda was all love and devotion. Well, he would not think, he would go to sleep and reflect in the morning. Go to sleep he did not, and at the break fast table next morning kind Aunt Dorothy, who presided {vice Mrs. Hesketh, superseded, and in her chamber), was quite concerned at his jaded appearance."], [89, "79 DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. \" Cuthbert, my dear bairn, how ill you look ; is anything wrong with you \u2014 are you not well ? \" inquired she, anxiously. \" No, thank you, dear aunt, only I cannot sleep well out of a hammock, and last night I was more restless than usual.\" \" Dear me, what a fuss about nothing. I never heard you complain of your bed before ; but then, to be sure, there was no one to encourage your senseless whimsies until now,\" jerked out Lucy, with a toss of her head, a curl of her always turned-up nose, and a glance of supreme scorn at Miss Dorothea. \" You mean, Lucy,\" said Mr. Hesketh, stoutly, \" that until your Aunt Dorothy came there was no one with womanly sympathy or observation in the house,\" \" I meant no such thing. I meant what I said.

Lucy had been locked up twice since her father brought his sister home, and knowing that even her mother was powerless to uphold her, wisely succumbed to the strong hand, not a little influenced moreover by her aunt's hint concerning beauty and beaux. So she held her peace after her father's threat, if we except a few angry mutterings like the distant rumble of a spent thunder storm. \"Well, Aunt Dorothy, I own it was lubberly to speak as I did, and I am sorry I so degraded myself.

Oh, I've something up-stairs that will just suit you !\" and off he set, almost upsetting in his haste Mrs. Hesketh, who stood in the doorway, with expressively folded hands."], [93, "83 DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. \" Ah, Mr. Hesketh, that is just like your son ; he is remarkably ready with his kisses. He never kissed me in his life.\" \"Did you ever kiss him, Maria, even as a boy ?

And when did your son ever bring me a present like that, I should like to know?\" continued she, superciliously, as Cuthbert, re-entering the room, unfolded a valuable Canton-crape shawl and placed it round the shoulders of his gratified relative with a look of admira tion. At the remark he turned round, and answering his step-mother, said quietly, \" I brought that shawl home from China when I brought the handkerchiefs for father and Mr. Marsh.

Remember that, Cuthbert.\" \"That I will, aunt, for the sake of the kind voice that said it,\" cried Cuthbert, as he went off for the second shawl. Both Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy looked very foolish when he returned with a shawl differing only from the other in its em broidery. The one was worked in coloured"], [95, "85 DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. silks, and so deftly wrought, that no eye could detect a joining or distinguish right side from wrong, whilst the colours were remarkably pure and brilliant. The second was simply a cream white like the body of the other, and Mrs. Hesketh, fond of fine colours, looked long ingly at the prize she had lost, though she was gracious enough to thank him, and mutter some sort of an apology. Miss Dorothea, detecting the vagrant look, volun teered to exchange shawls with Mrs. Hesketh, saying that the white one would best suit an old woman. Mrs. Hesketh would have accepted the offer, but Cuthbert negatived it at once, giving his aunt all credit for good nature, but maintaining his own right of presentation. Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy learnt a lesson that day they were not likely to forget, since it touched one of then weak points \u2014 love of dress ; a lesson deepened when, some months later, a gentleman, staying in Scar borough at the same time with themselves,"], [96, "86 STUNG TO THE QUICK. accosted Miss Dorothea and offered to pur chase her shawl at any price she would name. He was a manufacturer of brocades by the Jacquard loom, and wished to make experi ments on the dyes and method of em broidery. \u00a350, \u00a360, \u00a370, \u00a380 were offered ; and when the old lady respectfully, but firmly, told him it was a gift which no money could purchase, he went away quite chagrined, his commercial mind not under standing a higher claim than money. But this is in advance of the story, which must drift away from the shawl and shawl wearers, to the shawl-giver and the wily woman who was bent on his destruction. Cuthbert had half resolved to steer clear of South Street, but the little episode of the shawls having lost him his train, and there being no other until the afternoon (railways in 1840 were not much beyond their in fancy), he walked with his father to the office, and thence sauntered through the Bailey and Palace Green to the walks by the"], [97, "87 DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE.

As may be anticipated she soon overtook Cuthbert, as he was sauntering listlessly along, with the rattan in his hand, striking down here and there a pendant icicle, or a solitary leaf fluttering on a bare bough, or flicking the hoar frost from the grass which fringed his path with fairy spears, less threatening in their myriads than the one living foe tracking his steps with a smiling face and pitiless heart. A heart aye colder than the frost of winter, for that might thaw, and her heart would not. Every frosty rime or flake of snow in each succeeding winter fell upon that heart and chilled it. It was in winter she was left to the elements, left to the mercy of the world, a waif on the banks of that very river, to be fostered by charity and taunted with her birth and dependence when least prepared for the shock.

Did not the very servants execute her commands with an obedience differing from the obe dience with which Eva's very wishes were anticipated ? Had not those domestics (or two of them) seen her in her rags, a pinched and frozen atomy, and did they not look as if they remembered it well ? What had the world done for her but cultivate a sensibility to pain and ignominy ? Had she not been nurtured in a belief that honour and com petence, nay, luxury, were her birthright, only to be told at last that she was beggar born, base-born, and had no claim on kin or kindness ? Had it not been more cruel than kind to pamper her into a keener sense of wrong and shame ? She owed nothing to the world but scorn, and she would pay it in kind.

What should he do now ? He could not turn and run like a coward from a woman. He had not sought the meeting, and fate itself de clared against him. He would arm himself. Vain his armoury. She came prepared to complete her conquest, and he was ill-pre pared to resist it. The outworks had given way long ago, and only the citadel remained to be vanquished. She professed herself amazed to see him there, had feared he was on his way to Sun derland without a thought for her. She had been stifled by the atmosphere in-doors and came out to see if the cold fresh air would relieve her aching head. And then she sighed as if the case was hopeless. Besides"], [102, "92 STUNG TO THE QUICK. she longed to be alone ; it was so terrible to sit and chatter amongst thoughtless and happy people, wearing a mask to hide her own emotions while her very heart was breaking, and those around knew nothing of her trouble.

Cuthbert standing there before her like a criminal, measuring his rattan with hands and eyes, not daring to look up into hers, began to apologise, and blundered out something not very intelligible, but very much to the purpose (Rhoda's purpose), of his regret and sorrow that any inadvertent act or word of his should have given a moment's uneasiness to her, of the sleepless night he had spent, and how miserable he was at the thought of her pain.

A hint from his shipowners at length stimulated his movements, and he unwil lingly tore himself from Rhoda. She had, however, so contrived that at his departure he begged she would write to him, and she, with feigned reluctance, consented ; but she hated the name of \" Rhoda,\" and would only be written to as \" Eve,\" a name as near to her dear cousin's sweet one as she"], [104, "94 STUNG TO THE QUICK. could think.

She knew her uncle had other views for her and dared not meet his displeasure if their love were avowed openly. Those other views clearly referred to Edwin Grove, whose palpable attentions had excited Cuthbert's chagrin months before, and Dr. Groves's intimacy with Mr. Marsh decidedly favoured the supposition of a desire to cement that friendship by closer union. A clandestine correspondence, under ex isting circumstances, suited Cuthbert ad mirably. He was not so satisfied with his own conduct, or so assured of his ultimate pur pose, as to dare proclaim openly that which would not bear scrutiny in bro?.d daylight.

One day he turned his horse's head north ward over Durham Moor through Pity-me and PlawsAvorth as far as Chester-le-Street, and whilst the animal baited, he and Eva examined the monuments and effigies in the ancient church of the old Roman station, on that grand Roman road. Another day their course Avould lie through Sacristan to Witton Gilbert, and across the country, returning by Nevil's Cross. Then he drove westAvard, through Brancepeth and Willington to Byer's Green ; and as they tra versed Willington, Eva pointed out the large gloomy house of dull red brick, whose story William Howitt and Mrs. Crowe have made so familiar to us. At that time neither Mr. HoAvitt nor Mrs. Crowe had published their account of \" The haunted House of Willington,\" and William Drury's"], [115, "THE GREY TOWER. 105 nocturnal watch did not take place until some months later, so that Eva could only relate the marvellous stories respecting its ghost or ghosts current in the locality, and which she had learnt from Nancy, who had been born close by, long years before the house itself was erected.

It Avas a secluded building, part mansion, part castle, almost hidden from the view by a belt of large forest trees surrounding it on all sides ; ivy had groAvn up to the battle ments, and hung in neglected festoons over the gothic entrance, Avhich AATas situated in an angle of the building, and closed Avith a"], [116, "106 STUNG TO THE QUICK. heavy oaken door studded Avith large nails. This portion of the building Avas more ele vated than the rest, so that a small turret, situated immediately over the doorway, towered above the trees, and was visible for some distance clown the road. From this feature the whole pile had ob tained the name of the Grey ToAver ; and as it had been for some years uninhabited, there was a slight air of desolation about the spot which the neighbouring villagers had not failed to couple with stories of the super natural. Frank stopped the horse at the gate, and pointed to the abandoned dAvelling, say ing\u2014 \" There it is, Eva ; Avhat do you think of it ? \" \" Dear me, I thought you were going to show me some strange place I kneAv nothing about.

The gate Avas not locked, but it was very unwilling to open, so Mr. Raeburn called \"Geordie,\" to a pitman passing at the time. The man came forward readily to put a second and much sturdier shoulder to the gate, Avhich then gave Avay sloAvly, making a circular track in the soil, as gravel and dead leaves were pushed in a groAving heap before it."], [119, "THE GREY TOWER. 109 But the man steadily refused the shilling Mr. Raeburn proffered for the serArice he had rendered, and with a rough boAV Avent his Avay. \" Aw dinna need payin to be ceevil,\" said he.

A small rustic bridge crossed the streamlet close by the ravine, and paths led from it up the hill sides, Avinding among the trees which clothed the steep \u2014 larch and pine, beech and birch, oak and haAvthorn \u2014 and leading to mossy seats in shady nooks, commanding views of grounds, or tower, or road. But, when SAvollen by heavy rains, the stream, o'erleaping its bed as it left the ravine, formed a fresh one for itself down the wide gvavel walk, shaded by oak and sycamore, which led from the rustic bridge to the Gothic doorway, and then rushed like a river down the carriage-drive to the gates and the road."], [137, "eva's new home. 127 Unaware of this peculiarity until, as a denizen of the Tower, he became incon veniently acquainted Avith it, no steps had been taken by Mr. Eaeburn to interpose an effectual barrier between the water and the pathway, which, consequently, Avas still liable to be flooded in very rainy Aveather.

This place was not more than six feet square, and was lit by a small diamonded AAdndoAV, fronting the hfll, and overlooking the roof of the main budding. In an adjoining lumber-loft Ehoda had stowed away a thick mattrass, which closely fitted this floor, but which Avas so constructed that on raising the trap a portion of the mattrass, larger than the trap itself, would rise with it. It lay there, covered with matting and canvas in which furniture had been packed, and no one exploring the premises would have suspected that a secret lay beneath.

Indeed, he Avent so far as to ask his betrothed if she had duly considered the importance of the step she suggested, but she, ever willing to spare her cousin a pang, Avished to remove her from \" the eternal reminder of that restless river,\" as Rhoda had begun to call it, and so answered him at once that her cousin was always miserable in South Street, and would be so much happier Avith them, besides being a pleasant companion for her self."], [169, "THE SHED IN THE DINGLE. 159 Unwilling to deny Eva's first request of moment, he complied, and invited Rhoda to make the Tower her home, with unpretending courtesy. At the same time, he felt that her ready acceptance savoured of ingratitude to her benefactor, who would certainly be more solitary, deprived of his daughter, than Eva would with her husband by her side, and he almost regretted he had not explained to Eva his motives for objection. There are concessions which are neither kind nor complimentary, and this Avas one. He had not assigned a reason for desiring Rhoda's exclusion, nor yet exercised Eva's judgment in decision. Her reasons were given freely. They did not convince him, yet he gave way almost Avithout a remonstrance, and Avith his accus tomed reticence, kept his impressions to himself. A serious mistake that, Mr. Raeburn ! The Avoman Avho is old and Avise enough to wive, is old and wise enough to trust, is old and Avise enough to take into your secret counsels ! Mr. Raeburn had a"], [170, "160 STUNG TO THE QUICK. glimmering perception of his mistake, yet he made it. He did not tell his bride that Rhoda was a dangerous inmate, having looked loAre if she had not openly proffered it to him. Not being conceited, he had in clined' to ascribe to vanity or self-esteem the groAving coirviction of Rhoda's smothered attachment to himself. It folloAved naturally that he shrank from making himself ridicu lous by an avowal of such an opinion, and still more from clouding with a tinge of jealousy Eva's clear and unsuspicious breast. Beside, if it were so, the girl had no un due fascination for him, there was no fear of his love wandering from the Avise of his choice ; he had full confidence in himself, and all fear of alienated affection or jealousy was preposterous ; so he kept his own counsel and Rhoda had her will. But it soon became apparent to Frank that the active rule of the household Avas in Rhoda's hands ; and that, Avhdst professedly deferring to Mrs. Raeburn as the nominal"], [171, "161 THE SHED IN THE DINGLE. authority ; house, servants, and all pertaining thereto Avere under her control. This was one of the evils he had foreseen, from his ob servation of their relative positions in Mr. Marsh's home. Dominion came naturally to Rhoda, and what with the hiring of servants, the appoint ment of their respective duties, the superin tendence and direction of Avorkpeople fitting up the place, she was installed mistress even before the true mistress came. Nor did she resign her rule with the keys. She took especial care that Mrs. Raeburn's orders underwent filtration through her sieATe before reaching the domestics ; then she be gan gradually to suggest alterations and amendments in Eva's oavii plans, until her usurpation was complete. All this Avas os tensibly done Avith so earnest a desire to relieve her \" dear cousin \" (she Avas cousin once more) from the least care or anxiety, that Eva resigned the reins into her hands much as she had done before her mar- riage.

The young husband Avas not so easily hoodA\\lnked, he did not (as the diplomatist wished) deem his wife incompetent or imbe cile because the household sceptre was swayed by other hands.

On such occasions, she gave strict orders she was on no account to be disturbed, and Miss Wearbank's orders were never dis obeyed.

At times the maids Avere startled by finding her close upon them unaAvares, but beyond a passing remark on her disagreeably noiseless tread, no further observation was made.

He had the good fortune, as well as the good sense, to secure him a home at Trimdon Hall, close to his practice, yet elevated morally, socially, and geographically above the pitmen of Kelloe. The Doctor had no mind that EdAvin should marry either Rhoda or Lucy ; but of the two it is a question whether Lucy would not have had the preference.

This zeal was by no means a common fading amongst colliery surgeons, but Edwin had not become hardened to calculate his responsibilities by his remuneration ; nor was he, as too many of these isolated men are, driven by lack of society to make the decanter his companion ; so he studied hard, and did his duty well, ready and at his post night or day, whether required to reduce a fracture or a fever, to ease the coming or the departing life.

Long before he solved the question to his satisfaction, long before even he put it to himself, a change Avhich neArer entered into his calculations came over the damsel he de signed to honour, and altered the Avhole aspect of affairs.

The levee was over. Signor Ronchetti stepped into a light phaeton and drove away in the direction of Chester-le-Street. Mr. Hesketh returned to his office, not half satisfied that he had consented to pay a guinea and a-half a lesson to a foreigner, when there were English lay-vicars in the city who, in his opinion, Avould teach her quite as well for a third of the money.

For a teacher to advertise for pupils, and afterwards reject them, was a thing unprecedented ; there was more in this than met the eye. Mr. Hesketh had better look after his daughter.

He became quite proud of his daughter's singing, and although in former years he had care fully abstained from all mention of her in Miss Wearbank's hearing, he greAV so profuse in his praises of Signor Ronchetti and Lucy's vocal power, that, Avhether at the Tower or at Mr. Marsh's, he dragged the subject for- Avard on all occasions.

Eva, hearing so much of the Signor's extraordinary talents, and sensitively con scious of her inferiority to Rhoda, was, like Lucy, desirous of further cultivation, and wished to embrace so desirable an oppor tunity as Avas now offered.

Miss Dorothea, impressed with a whole some dread of young and handsome foreign musicians, remained discreetly in the room, knitting sections of a counterpane, during the brief lessons ; but, as they interfered with her accustomed siesta, it not unfre quently happened that the heat of the Aveather and the monotony of the sol-fa induced a cloze in her easy chair, and the knitting Avould become the prey of the kitten, Avhilst (avouM it be fair to say?) her niece became the prey of the cat."], [234, "224 STUNG TO THE QUICK. At aU events, Miss Lucy learned some thing more than music, or even Italian.

Then his soft warm hand came in contact Avith hers as he placed her fingers in better position. Her music, from the neAvest operas, was full of tender and impassioned sentiment, and the Signor looked a world of interpretation through the gold-rimmed spectacles Avith his full and brilliant eyes.

Mr. Hesketh had need to look after his daughter. But what of the young lady ? Had she learnt love as well as singing? That was a question for more than gossip. She was certainly in a flutter at the dis covery made by her vanity, and her elation was out of all proportion. Here Avas a chance to be revenged on EdAvin GroA^e. Oh, if he could but see the impassioned and pleading glances of the Signor ! If he could but know his place was better filled ; and gradually the fascinating Italian engrossed her thoughts and drove Edwin Grove into the background. Mr. Hesketh, in his office, perusing leases and agreements, or poring over plans, or out in the country measuring estates and roads, or consulting Avith Mr. Raeburn on the sinking of a neAV shaft, never thought of the mine sinking at home ; and Miss Dorothea, VOL.
