CHAPTER I. THE STIRRING OF STAGNANT WATERS. spHE A*illage of Rossan was not a very large one, but it was prosperous beyond the lot of most villages of its size in Scotland, its main support being an extensive granite quarry, worked by a wealthy company. Stagnant periods were rare, and wages were paid with the regularity of bank dividends. Illness, accident, or old age, might bring destitution into Rossan cottages ; otherwise it was due only to idleness or drunken ness. Rossan possessed not only prosperity, but great beauty of situation. It consisted of two fairly regular rows of houses, lining the sides of a high road, Avith an irregular fringe of dwellings scattered about behind them. It stood just AA7here the high"], [10, "2 DUNCAN MORAY. road crossed the head of a broad valley, so per fectly level to the very foot of its encircling hills, that there could be no doubt it had been, in pre historic ages, overflowed by the sea, now some miles distant. Where once the salt waves had foamed and danced, and sea birds had screamed, were now fertile meadows, in which sheep and cattle browsed peacefully, fields heavy in harvest time with golden grain, patches of wood, and here and there scattered trees of magnificent growth. Nor was the beauty of water awanting to the scene. Clear, SAvift, and strong, the Corran, leav ing behind among the lonely hills its deep, dark pools, brawling Avaterfalls, and sparkling shallows, Avound its tortuous course through mead and copsewood in a steady flow onwards to the sea, and was Avell beloved of many a lordly salmon. It swept close past the Avestern end of the village, and constituted, in fact, its chief water supply ; at least a plentiful and ever-changing one, if some what promiscuously used. The valley lay neaiiy due north and south, and behind the village the ground rose steadily,"], [11, "DUNCAN MORAY. 3 spreading forth luxuriant vegetation to the genial influences of a southern exposure, until cultivation gradually disappeared in a wild tract of mountain country, where the rugged, picturesque outlines of a granite formation, rich in the late summer and autumn with the glowing tints of great stretches of purple heather, swept downward to meet the viA'id green of rowans, or softer shades of feathery birches, sturdy oaks, and stunted thorns, shadowing the course of the foaming burns which made ceaseless music in deep dusky glens. The granite formation extended only down the western side of the valley. On its eastern side the hills were smooth and undulating, and, like the slopes northward from the \"village, were well culti- Arated, picturesquely wooded, and dotted over with farmhouses and cottages. Opposite lay a very different scene. There bold crags jutted out from among pine woods, clustering thickly over the sides and summits of the hills, and standing sharp and dark against the sky in lines as fantastic and irregular as the edges of a bank of rolling clouds, while more than one ragged rent in their"], [12, "4 DUNCAN MORAY. sombre expanse showed where some huge boulder from the loftiest crags had, at some time, carried all before it in its headlong course to the valley below. Near to the head of the valley these rugged westward hills were abruptly sundered by a romantic glen, at the very entrance to which, on its southern side, the steep scarped faces of the granite quarry showed themselves among the woods. Some distance further up the glen, on the northern side, stood Beeclnvood House, a quaint old turreted Scottish country house, half buried in the pine woods. It was a somewhat gloomy habitation, for there was more of cold shadow than cheerful sunshine in that lonely glen, but not with out a wierd beauty of its own, on even the gloomiest winter day. Given the glen as its site, the position of the house had not been injudiciouslv chosen, for a sudden dip in the hills, just opposite to it, let in upon it more light and sunshine from the south than any other part of the glen enjoyed. The church stood on the slope behind the village, and a little higher up was the manse,"], [13, "DUNCAN MORAY. 5 fondly claiming for itself the proud prerogative of possessing the finest view in all the neighbour hood. Such at least was the theory of Mrs. Fordyce, the minister's Avife, a small, sharp-featured woman, good natured, but sometimes waspish, and always a gossip ; Avho, if she did not tie with her tongue knots her hands could never undo, at least marred therewith the beneficial results Avhich might otherwise have resulted from many kind actions. Those who wished to stand well Avith her agreed with her respecting this claim of the manse; those who had the smart of caustic remarks to avenge, Avere apt to stand out for the superior claim of Craignellan, a farmhouse standing somewhat eastward of the village, at a consider ably higher level than either it or the manse. Rossan was always a fairly alert village, at least in fine weather ; the roadway swarming Avith children and dogs, the cottage doors with clusters of more or less slatternly looking women, discussing the newest piece of gossip, aud keeping Argus watch on the doings of their neighbours. But one fine afternoon about midsummer, the moral"], [14, "DUNCAN MORAY. 6 temperature rose to fever heat of excitement. Mr. Elliott, the old laird of Beechwood, had that very day ended a lingering illness by dying with sufficent suddenness to take Rossan by surprise, and consequently unprepared with theories and rumours as to what was to happen next. More over, Duncan Moray had ridden through the village at a sharp trot about mid- day. There seemed to be no end to the variety of patterns and designs in which these two simple occurrences could be interwoven, and tongues were wagging fast in every corner of Rossan. The most ani mated discussion was going on round the door of Mrs. Hamilton's cottage. She was a matron of high coloured visage, surmounted by a mass of fiery hair, generally in a marvellous state of dis hevellment, who in right of her semi-public position, as bellman's wife, was tacitly alloAved a sort of precedence in all questions of gossip. ' I doubt the auld man gaein' aff sae sudden '11 hae ta'en the Morays by surprise,' she was saying. ' I wad na say but Duncan's awa the noo to Kirkness, to see Dempster.'"], [15, "DUNCAN MORAY. 7 ' Hoot, woman,' retorted a neighbour, ' Demp ster's the auld laird's factor. It'll nae be to him the Morays '11 gang.' ' Dinna ye mak' sae sure o' that. Wha but Dempster can tell him aught aboot the new laird ? I'll no say but it may puzzle Dempster himsel' to find him. They do say the auld laird wadna suffer his name to be mentioned in this presence. Like eneuch naebody kens whar he is.' ' They say,' put in a younger woman, ' he's nae mair nor a laddie, an' that he's aAva in India.' ' Pack o' nonsense,' retorted Mrs. Hamilton, con temptuously. ' Weel, folk are sayin' it, ' Ay. Folk like yersel, that have na ken't Rossan mair nor a few years. What sud ye ken aboot the auld families ? The man ye mean is heir, sure eneuch, if so be the man that's laird noo has nae son.

Mither says she doubts they'll likely hae to advertise for him yet. Gude save us ! There's the minister ! ' The gossips disappeared with the rapidity of a group of frightened rabbits, to muster afresh else where when the peril was passed. As is usually the fate of gossips, they were wrong. Duncan Moray had ridden through Rossan in total ignor ance of the fact that the illness of the laird of Beechwood, not hitherto deemed au immediately dangerous one, had that very morning suddenly taken a most unfavourable turn ; and though his destination was Kirkness, his business was nothing more interesting than the procuring of some medicine for a cow which was ailing. The house at Craignellan, Adam Moray's farm, was a substantial well built dwelling, somewhat cold and stern of aspect, as Scottish farm houses are wont to be, with excellent farm buildings at a convenient distance from it. The whole appear ance of the place was significant of order and good management, but the masculine element was"], [17, "DUNCAN MORAY. 9 strongly in the ascendant. Everything was neat, trim and tidy, but there was little attempt at decoration. The grass round the house was close cut, and the shrubs Avere well pruned, but there were few flowers, and a garden seat, placed close to a magnificent weeping ash, was a structure of most uncompromising solidity and accuracy of right angles, such as no Avoman would haA'e tolerated for a moment. Within the house the same negation was even more obtrusively ap parent. A room furnished as a dining room, with excellent well kept furniture, and a smaller nonde script room, in which boots jostled business, and guns fraternized with great coats, were the only sitting rooms. The feminine element was solely represented by evidence of no stinted cleaning and polishing. It was a house carefully tended by a Avoman, for the sole benefit of men. That fact was perceptible at a glance. On that summer afternoon when the attention of Rossan had glanced obliquely off Beechwood with so much interest in the direction of Craignellan, the only occupants of the farm house were a mid-"], [18, "10 DUNCAN MORAY. die-aged woman and a strong servant lassie. The elder woman was busy with the girdle, and a pile of scones was being added to a stack of oat cakes on the white kitchen dresser. The girl was flitting in and out of the house, occupied Avith all the mul tifarious items of farm-house work. At length, during one of her temporary ab sences, the sound of a heavier tread than hers was heard approaching the house, and a man entered the kitchen, whose firm step and active movements almost seemed to belie his snowwhite hah* and beard, and the tell tale lines on his face. He was tall and thin, but a broad built muscular man, whom many a younger one might have hesitated to face as an antagonist ; and whose strong reso lute face harmonized well with his general aspect of both bodily and mental vigour. ' Duncan nae hame yet ? ' asked the Avoman, looking round as he entered. ' He's coming up the hill the noo ! ' Ye'se best pit aff yer boots here the day, Craig nellan,' the woman said, with a someAvhat rueful glance at the intruder's feet, which certainly indi-"], [19, "DUNCAN MORAY. 11 cated that his rambles had not been confined to roads. ' Mary's doin' up the Avee room, and she's no had time to finish it. Yer slippers are under the dresser.' Adam Moray submissively obeyed, and seating himself by the dresser drew out the strong leather shoes Avhich were dignified with the name of slip pers, and began operations on his heavy boots. While he was thus occupied another footstep drew near, and his son Duncan entered the kitchen, somewhat splashed with riding, but altogether much less objectionable in the eyes of a cleanly housewife than his father, just fresh off a tramp over ploughed land, and other objectionable com ponents of a thriving farm. He was a powerful man, full six feet in height, and of somewhat hea vier build than his father ; a handsome man, too, Avith light brown hair, beard and moustache, clear blue eyes, and a fair complexion Avhich, seeming able to answer the assaults of the sun by merely colouring without growing coarse in texture, gave a certain refinement to his appearance. ' Did ye hear aught o' Beechwood?' the old man"], [20, "12 DUNCAN MORAY. asked, looking up from his boots as his son en tered. ' He's gane ! ' Do ye say so ? I wadna thocht it wad be sae soon.' ' Nae mair did the doctors. They tauld Gilles pie yest'reen they'd little hope he wad Avin through, but they did not look for much change for a while yet. He took an ill turn about the break o' day, an' they've been waiting on him ever since. He died about three o'clock.' ' Weel, weel,' replied Adam Moray, ' he's been sair failed this last year past. But it's a pity to think o' an auld man like yon having livit a' his days sae as he'll nae be missed noo he's awa.' ' Deed, Craignellan,' exclaimed the scone maker, 7 ye're wrang there I doubt. Ye sud pit \" mourn ed \" for \" missed.\" I doubt he'll be missed eneuch, but wi' man o' gladness than o' sadness.' ' That's as may be, Joan. Time will show. But folk had best be in nae hurry wi' either their sad ness or their gladness, until they see what's to come. It's nae often things are that bad they can-"], [21, "DUNCAN MORAY. 13 na be worse. I've ken't o' worse lairds than auld Beechwood.' ' Nae doubt o' that, since ye ken't o' the wicked Colonel,' replied Joan. ' But I doubt the new land wad hae to be near as bad as him to be worse than him that's gane. The Elliotts have no muckle to boast in the way of gudeness, but they've maistly been decent livers.' ' Whisht, woman,' exclaimed the old man sternly. ' The auld man's gane before a juster Judge than you or me. It boots to be silent ower what's nae concern o' ours.' The woman muttered something inaudible, in a half impatient, half contemptuous tone, aud a sharp glance from Duucau Moray's steady eyes fell upon her, the Avhich, however, being at the moment occupied in turning her scones, she did not observe. ' Do ye think things will be worse, father ? ' he asked. ' Do ye ken aught o' the new land ? ' ' Not I, Duncan. It's likely I may have seen him as a laddie, but I've nae mind o't. The ill blude between him and his cousin is a far aff story"], [22, "DUNCAN MORAY. 14 noo, and he's never been near hand since. I doubt if onybody rightly kens what it was Avent Avrang between them.' ' Ay,' ye're richt eneuch there,' put in Joan. ' I was doun speerin' for the laird yestreen, and I asked auld Nannie Blair. She's been about Beech wood a' her days, and minds the new laird weel as a laddie. They a' think the auld land never liket him ower weel. He was nae favourite, proud and stiff in the temper. But nane o' them about the place ever ken't just what went wrang. It was something when he was at the college, and they do say he had to get oot o' the country for a while. But naebody kens rightly.' ' He'll likely heir a barren inheritance,' said Duncan Moray. ' I doubt he'll get naught the auld land could leave awa' from him.' ' An' part o' that will be the Rig Mains. Ye'll likely get it noo, Craignellan, for but a trifle.' ' Time eneuch to talk about that when we ken hoAv things go,' replied the old man. ' Hoot, man,' exclaimed Joan impatiently, ' ye sud be to the fore first start, Wbar' wad be the"], [23, "DUNCAN MORAY. 15 use o' a bit o' land to ony man that could na get at it save by the leave o' ither men ? Ye're naught but a gomeril if ye're no ready to mak' the best bargain ye can for what's justly your ain the noo.' ' I'm no sure ye're just a judge about that matter,' replied Adam Moray, rising from his seat. ' Ye dinna just ken a' about that business. An' noo ye can let us have tea as soon as ye're fit. I'm tired and thirsty.' He left the kitchen as he spoke. His son lingered behind him. ' Joan,' he said, as soon as his father was out of hearing, ' ye must'nt speak that way to my father. Its no' the first time lately I've heard ye speak to him in a way I dinna like. He's master here, remember.' The woman coloured angrily. ' What wad ye hae Duncan ? It pits me fair mad to see him tak' things sae coolly.' ' Ye can be as mad as ye please, I'm no objecting to that ; only ye must keep yer tongue in order. My father's growing an auld man, and it's no but likely Ave may have to try an' manage"], [24, "16 DUNCAN MORAY. him a bit, as time goes on. But he's aye to be spoken civilly and respectfully to ; sae just remember.' He had seated himself as he spoke, and began to take off his own boots, understanding from his father's action that this was one of the days when Joan, bristling with household utensils, came down, like a wolf on the fold, upon the untidiness of the little room, and left it a stem solitude of un impeachable order and cleanliness. Joan took refuge in tears, giving vent to an audible sob now and again, and Aviping her eyes a trifle osten tatiously Avith her apron. But Duncan Moray did not quail before these aAvful symptoms. He deliberately finished his operations and rose to leave the kitchen. Then Joan Availed out. ' I never thocht to hear ye speak that gait to me, Duncan. I suppose ye'll be for mari*yin', an' want me to gang. But ye might tell me fan* oot, an' no try it on that gait.' ' Wha's the gomeril noo ? ' was the unsym pathetic rejoinder. Then he added, kindly, ' Don't be a fool, Joan. Ye ken fine neither my father"], [25, "DUNCAN MORAY. 17 nor I'll ever forget ye've been a kind friend an' faithful housekeeper to us since ever my mother died. Ten years ago, I'd have minded less how ye spoke to my father, but when a man's growing auld, an' nae sae fit to haud his ain, it boots his son should be extra careful he's treated wi' proper respect. Auld folk get a bit fashious in their ways whiles, sae its weel to stop sharp speaking at the first set out. Noo get in the tea. The auld man's had a long tramp, and I see he's tired.' With that he followed his father to the dining room. Adam Moray was sitting beside the table, with his head leaning on his hand, in a somewhat despondent attitude. Duncan laid a hand gently on his shouldei*. ' Dinna ye trouble yer heid father, wi' things ye dinna care to think about,' he said, with a peculiar gentleness of intonation, always more or less ap parent in his address to his father. ' But I'll no say but she's right, Duncan. Ony Avay she is about the position o' the land.

If it's left awa' frae the new laird, which is pretty certain, there'll be nane to bid for it but him an' me ; and it's like eneuch, if he rightly ken't hoo the matter stood, he'd no bid against me. But I dread raking up a' the business again. It was a heart break to me an' yer uncle Robert to see the havoc brooding ower it worked in oor father.' ' An' are ye wanting to bring sic a heart-break on me ? ' asked his son, with a smile. ' Na, na. I hope it wad na come to that. But the thocht o' the past has aye made me dread thinking aboot the matter. It's dear prosperity that's bought wi' the souring or hardening o' a man's nature.' ' Weel, just ye think nae mair about it the now, father. Where's the use o' troubling over the matter, until we ken if there's a will.' ' There's safe to be one, for the sake o' they Edinburgh folk.' ' There's no telling. Folk sometimes put it off till too late. If there's nane, the matter's just where it's aye stood. If there is, there'll be time"], [27, "DUNCAN MORAY. 19 enough to think about it when we ken wha gets the unentailed land. Folk do say he's got rid o' every bit, save the Rig Mains. We've dune weel enough wi'out that a' these years, an' we'll do weel enough wi'out it in the future.' ' But if ye marry, Duncan, ye'd be the better o' mair land.' ' Time enough to think o' that when I'm thinking o' marrying. Here comes the tea. Awa an' get yersel' ready. Ye'll feel a deal better when ye've had yer tea.' The old man rose with a more cheerful manner. The mere presence of his son had a reviving influence upon him, and when, after a brief absence, he re-entered the room, the spectacle there was the reverse of depressing. A substantial meal was spread, and Joan, quite restored to equanimity, was seated, trim and tidy, at the head of the table, pouring out tea, with a brass kettle beside her, dazzling to behold in the brilliancy of its polish. Duncan pushed forward his father's chair, and with quiet unobtrusive attention supplied all his wants ; and Joan was assiduous in her care.

A NINETY YEAR OLD MYSTERY. TUST a hundred years had passed away since the transactions had taken place which had first brought the Morays into connection with the Elliotts of Beechwood. The then possessor of the property was a man somewhat of the high-handed desperado type, not unknown in those days, when opportunities for exercising the peculiar talents of the species had not been so cruelly curtailed as in these democratic times. He was an inveterate gambler, and had soon found himself reduced to most desperate straits for money, and, at last, driven to raise it by the sale of Craignellan, the only unentailed piece of the Beechwood estate. Thus Craignellan had passed to the Morays, having been bought by Adam's great uncle, then a middle aged miser, who having, by dint of unwearied grinding and screwing, achieved the darling aim of"], [30, "DUNCAN MORAY. 22 his life, to become in his small way a landed pro prietor, had never succeeded in shaking off the penurious habits thus acquired. He had picked quarrels with all his own family, mainly that he might escape being asked to do anything for any of its less fortunate members, and for nearly thirty years after he left his original home, to take possession of his estate, nothing was ever heard of him. Then, one day, his nephew, William Moray, Adam's father, heard to his no small amazement that the old man had died, leaving no will, and that as next-of-kin he was entitled to succeed to all his possessions. The old miser had, it appeared, been too penurious to face the thought of employing a lawyer to make his will, shrewd enough not to attempt to do it himself, and thus had put off indefinitely any decisive step, until too late. When he set out for Craignellan, William Moray believed himself to be a very rich man. At his journey's end, he found salutary disappointment awaiting him. He had certainly came into posses sion of a very nice little property, but the wealth, in money, of the old miser, had been, as is common,"], [31, "DUNCAN MORAY. 23 greatly exaggerated. It fell very far short of the amount his nephew expected to find, and thus the man, who a week before had been cheerful and contented with an income only just sufficient to maintain his family respectably, began to fret and hold himself an ill-used person, because he found himself only in possession of a sure and comfortable maintenance, with a good round sum lying in hard cash to accumulate against unsxpected contin gencies. He had not been forty-eight hours at Craig nellan ere the traditions of Rossan began to be freely detailed for his benefit. They were some what startling in tenor, and greatly calculated to foster the rapid growth of his incipient grievance. They were also bewildering in variety, at least as to matters of detail. The typical ' oldest inhabi tant ' was in his glory, being the only authority on wont and usage. But then, in the present case, ' oldest inhabitants ' literally swarmed, and he who gloried in indubitable proof of priority in actual years, was tiiumphantly demolished with longer or more intimate personal acquaintance"], [32, "DUNCAN MORAY. 24 with facts ; while each possessed a wholly different, and the only trustworthy version of the story. William Moray was a clear-headed man, but it took him a long time to arrive at any opinion as to what portion of these stories rested on such foundations as to afford even a probability of their approximation in any appreciable degree to the truth. All these thriving traditions had reference to the ground known as the Rig Mains, a piece of very good land, over a hundred acres in extent. The testimony of all the oldest inhabitants, most of whom had worked on the farm, was unanimous as to the fact that, prior to the sale, it had always been a part of Craignellan farm. There unanimity ended, and imaginative ingenuity was let loose upon an imperfectly explained transaction. The main thread of the tradition was much as follows. The Rig Mains had undoubtedly a value for Craignellan, beyond its mere actual value, in con- sequence of some questions about water supply, and practical working of the farm. David Moray, a shrewd farmer, had seen this at a glance, but the land was also important, though to a much"], [33, "DUNCAN MORAY. 25 smaller extent, to the home farm at Beechwood, and Colonel Elliott had wished to retain it. There had been a hot dispute over the point, but Moray had yielded \u2014 tradition said, as an act of far-sighted policy, He saw the snare Colonel Elliott was spreading for his own feet. His habits would soon sink him in difficulties again, and Craignellan sold, he had not a bit of unentailed land left, except the Rig Mains, which was absolutely inac- cessible, save to the proprietors of Beechwood and Craignellan. Who would buy land he could not reach save by the permission of men who might be total strangers to him ? David Moray saw that not only would reserving the Rig Mains decrease the market value of the rest of the farm, but that, if he bided his time, it would almost cer tainly one day be his, almost at his oAvn price. That all this was pure hypothesis, William Moray felt convinced. His uncle had been the last man in the world to take the public into his confidence, but on the face of it it was a plausible one. Then tradition went on to relate \u2014 and this was the part of the story through which it was so"], [34, "26 DUNCAN MORAY. difficult to trace the slender thread of probability \u2014 that old Moray's anticipations had been justi fied. Colonel Elliott, actually forced to quit the country, had re-opened communications through a lawyer's firm in a neighbouring county town ; the purchase had been effected by David Moray, and the longed-for land become rightfully his. Meantime, however, Colonel Elliott had lightedupon an heiress ill advised enough to aid with her for tune the restoration of his decaying prosperity, Then, bitterly repenting his bargain, he had set himself to undo it Avithout relinquishing the pro fits, in a manner not inconsistent Avith the times, and his character. He had come to Beechwood, announced to Moray that in drawing up the necessary transfer a most awkward flaw in title deeds had been discovered, and begged him to call the next evening at Beechwood, to meet a very eminent laAvyer, and to bring Avith him all the papers he had bearing on the purchase. Moray, complying with the request, had found the whole place in confusion, a post chaise and four horses at the door, and Colonel Elliott just"], [35, "DUNCAN MORAY. 27 coming out of the house. He had hurriedly ex plained that urgent business had forced him to start instantly for London, expressed his regret, promised to write, and begging Moray to go in and take some refreshment, had jumped into the chaise and driven off at a furious pace. Part of the refreshment had been very excellent whisky \u2014 always a snare to old Moray, when to be had at other people's expense. He never knew how he got home; but the one thing certain was that every scrap of paper bearing on the sale of the land was gone. Then had come a sudden change of front on the part of Colonel Elliott and his lawyer. The purchase had never been completed, the papers in question had been merely drafts, sent to Mr. Moray for his lawyer's perusal. If he had been robbed, it was not of the least conse quence, as Colonel Elliott had quite resolved to break off the negotiations. He had gone abroad, squandered his Avife's fortune, and died, practically an outlaw, shortly before old Moray's own death. What then ? William Moray had remarked. The"], [36, "28 DUNCAN MORAY. story, if true, was immaterial to him, as the papers had doubtless been carefully destroyed. Not at all, he was assured. It was quite certain \u2014 though the exact nature of the certainty was not stated \u2014 that Colonel Elliott's man of business was fully as astute as the Colonel himself, and had carefully hidden the papers, meaning to make good use of them in the future; a benevolent intention frustrated by his firm getting into difficulties, which caused the principals to leave the country. But there was no doubt the papers were all concealed somewhere about Beechwood House. The story was far too carefully filled in for William Moray not to perceive that it must have undergone much polishing and shaping during the twenty years which had passed since the date of the transactions in question. How much of it Avas true? He was advised to Aisit the minister, Avithin whose recollection the circumstances would be. Mr. Niven spoke cautiously. He certainly could not confirm the stories afloat, but he did not think they were entirely Avithout foundation. He"], [37, "DUNCAN MORAY. 29 had himself heard old Moray assert that Colonel Elliott had swindled him, though he was always very reticent as to particulars. Mr. Niven's own impression had always been that there was some thing on David Moray's own part in the business which he did not care should see the light, and that had held him back from taking any decided step in the matter. William Moray had then turned his attention to his uncle's papers. The old man had not been Avont to provide information for posterity by keep ing a diary, and his papers were neither many nor important. Still there were a few notes, casual allusions, and calculations, which, though not in themselves very intelligible, did tend, as suppli menting received tradition, to confirm the assertion that, near about the time specified, some transac tions regarding the Rig Mains had taken place. Unquestionably, just at that date, the amount of the old man's carefully hoarded bank deposit showed a very large and wholly unaccounted for diminution. William Moray had finally applied to Colonel"], [38, "30 DUNCAN MORAY. Elliott's successor, and had received a courteous reply from his lawyer. The late Mr. Moray had called Mr. Elliott's attention to the matter, on his succession, but his story was very confused, and, understanding that his memory had failed much, no great attention had been given to the subject. Still some search had been made, but without any evidence having been found that Colonel Elliott had ever contemplated any such sale. Thus the matter had ended, and William Moray had, in the first instance, made the sensible resolu tion that he would think no more about it. But that resolution he had failed of abihty to cany out. Such a plausible explanation seemed to be thus provided for that diminished balance in hard cash over which he fretted, and of which, not being a practical farmer, he lost a good deal more ere he gained the experience which enabled him, afterwards, to manage the farm more profitably. He found himself constantly wondering how much his uncle had given for the land, and calculating interest for tAventy years on hypothetical sums. It Avould have been bad enough to have been robbed"], [39, "DUNCAN MORA Y. 31 of something which had been bodily carried off, but it was far worse to see lying there, constantly before his eyes, the very thing of which he had been defrauded. Aud somewhere in that old house away up the glen, he ere long fully per suaded himself, lay the proofs that he had been thus defrauded. Probably he had something of his uncle's spirit in him. At any rate he brooded constantly over the subject, and thus had begun that subtle change in him which, even in child hood, his sons had observed and lamented. He had brought with him to Craignellan a son and a daughter, and Adam had been born about a year afterwards. William Moray Avas a most affectionate father, and his love for his children had greatly aided to keep his losses, real or imaginery, rankling in his thoughts. To divide the farm was to cripple both sons, or bind both to a partnership which marriage must render irksome. What money he possessed must go to Ellen, Avho had always been frail. If only he had had the money Avhich was rightly his it would have given Adam a grand start."], [40, "DUNCAN MORAY. 32 Adam, as he grew up, made light of that.

To Australia accordingly he went, but he was not fated to spend a A7ery great part of his life there. Fust Nellie died, then Robert ; and by the time he was thirty years of age, Adam Moray was on his way home, to manage the farm Avhich would one day be all his own. He had always been reticent about his ten years in Australia. He admitted he had made money, but said he had lost it in an unlucky venture. The change in his father had been a terrible grief to him, although his brother's letters had prepared him for it. Brooding constantly over his wrongs, the old man's determination to see in every occurrence not absolutely favourable to him some result of the fraud in which he had come to believe unhesita tingly, had become almost a monomania.

With each change old Moray had urged his story on the new possessor, and had been treated, at least by the last one, with contemptuous neglect, as a man Avhose grasping nature led him to try and make capital out of some old Avives' gossiping fables. The laird was no friendly neighbour. He was known bitterly to resent the sale of Craignellan, Avhich he declared had only been rendered possible by a palpable flaAv in the deed of entail. So bitter was he on the subject that men had commented upon it as strange that though the dying out of another branch of the family had brought him, as heir at laAA7, seATeral good farms in a neighbouring county, which Avere not entailed, he had never made any attempt to negotiate an exchange with the Morays.

It was in vain that Adam Moray urged upon his c"], [42, "DUNCAN MORAY. 34 father to think no more of possibilities, which lapse of time alone must now prevent from ever becoming actual facts. No lapse of time, the old man declared, could ever bar his claim, if papers were discovered which proved positively that a fraud had been perpetrated ; and his perpetual brooding over the subject made Craignellan a rather dreary home to his son, until he brought home a bright, clever, young wife, w7ho loyally aided him in trying to turn his father's thoughts away from his grievance. William Moray, how ever, only survived Duncan's birth about six months, and then Adam found himself in pros perous circumstances, \"with eArery prospect of a peaceful, happy life. Mrs. Moray had died when Duncan was about ten years old, and then his father, after Aveathering many storms and perils, such as beset the track of a Avell-to-do Avidower in his voyage across life's ocean, had at length been left to his oaa*u devices at Craignellan, with his son and his faithful house keeper, Joan Clerk. His management of his son had been Arery judicious, because it Avas the result"], [43, "DUNCAN MORAY. 35 of an affection, as manly and sensible, as profound, and because constant association AA7ith himself was, as far as the nobler parts of a man's nature were in question, the best education a boy could have. That sort of education which is to be got by the aid of dog-eared books, Avithin the four Avails of a dreary schoolroom, Avas of the most elementary character in rural districts in those days, and Duncan Moray would have cut a poor figure in a competitive examination ; but he had from child hood imbibed all the sentiments of his father, Avho had brought back Avith him to his native land, unimpaired by all the evil influences of colonial life in the earlier part of the century, that sterling honesty which is a common characteristic of the Scotch, united to a breadth of view, and absence of prejudice, which is less common. Adam Moray was a man of the type that sweareth to his neigh bour and disappointeth him not, though it were to his own hindrance ; and if there was ever a difference between his word and his deed, it Avas because, if he judged it right and just, his deed Avent further than his Avoid pledged him. ' Just a"], [44, "36 DUNCAN MORAY. gomeril,' he had often been dubbed by men who saw him fail to take advantage, at the expense of someone else, of some unexpected rise or fall in prices, after a bargain had been struck. Yet, strange to say, the very men who most freely applied the epithet Avere the very ones Avho most eagerly hunted for the ' gomeril,' to act as umpire in any disputed transaction. From his earliest years, Duncan Moray had been his father's con stant companion, and as he grew older, his most trusted friend. The relation between them were much more like those of an elder and younger brother, than of a father and son. Duncan Moray, under the influence of his father's training, had grown up a A7ery faA7ourable specimen of his class. He Avas just shy enough to be rather quiet among strangers, AAithont his self possession being in any way affected; and he possessed much of that childlike simplicity Avhich when, as in his case, is united AAith shreAvdncss and common sense, only, in the finest characters survives the inevitable experiences of a man's life. His clear blue eyes could flash out glances of"], [45, "DUNCAN MORAY. 37 falcon-like keenness on occasions ; and more than one self confident Avorldling, Avho had judged the manly straight-forward farmer to be a fitting sub ject for sharp practice, had carried aAvay a sad and sorry remembrance of the results. ' Beware the fury of a patient man.' When Duncan Moray's eyes began to darken, and his face to pale, such men were apt to learn, Avith startling suddenness, that there was sound Avisdom in that adage. In one thing only had Duncan Moray sorely disappointed his father, and that Avas in his remaining a bachelor until he had reached the age of eight and thirty. It had not been for want of soft-seducing Aviles that this result had come about. The Avooing he had been sIoav to under take had been freely undertaken for him. There were five daughters at the manse, and the gossips Avho repaid Mrs. Fordyce in kind for her own freely circulated supplies of the commodity, averred that she Avould have been well pleased to see one of her daughters become step-mother-in law to another, if she could have secured the chance. She had certainly courted Duncan Moray"], [46, "DUNCAN MORAY. 38 assiduously, but she had courted in vain. The maidens of the manse were not to his mind. ' I never took a notion o' ony of them,' was his simple rejoinder, when twitted with Mrs. Fordyce's motherly blandishments. The idea that he was fastidious never crossed his mind. He Avould have married the byre girl Avith perfect equanimity if, to use his OAvn phrase, he had taken a notion of her, AA-hich, howeA7er, save in the case of a remai k ably exceptional byre girl, he Avas very sure not to do, for the simple reason that, wholly unsus pected by himself, he Avas very fastidious.

When and wherever it did draAV him, that he would avoo, and with a calm, quiet persistency on Avhich, truth to tell, fate is apt sometimes to smile strangely. It was the interest of this dearly loved son which now constituted the only inducement to Adam Moray to turn his attention once more to a subject he detested, and which had for years been almost"], [47, "DUNCAN MORAY. 39 Avholly absent from his thoughts. He held it almost a certainty that with the death of the old laird the disputed land would cease to form a part of the Beechwood estate, and pass into possession of people who, in consideration of its peculiar situation, could do nothing with it save offer it for sale to either the neAV laird or himself. For Duncan's sake ought he not to move in the business, at least so far as to lay all the facts before Mr. Elliott, and ask him, as a matter merely of honour able feeling, to examine into and form his own judgment upon the current traditions of the neighbourhood, before he determined to bid for the land against his neighbour? The thought of raking up afresh the subject which had caused him so much sorrow and trouble in the past was so repugnant to him that it oppressed him like a nightmare, seeming to render the coming of the new laird in some mysterious way a presage of evil to himself, and not allowing him entirely to follow his son's sensible advice, and let the matter rest until they had some certain knowledge Avhat disposition old Mr. Elliott had made of his property."], [48, "40 DUNCAN MORAY. CHAPTER III. MISS ELLIOTT OF BEECHWOOD. TT Avas in a London ball-room that Isabel Elliott, the only child of the new and somewhat sus piciously regarded laird of Beechwood, first learned that she had suddenly acquired more social import ance than had hitherto fallen to her share. She Avas what is generally termed a fine looking girl, her friends alloAA ed that she Avas handsome, but Avithout greatly admiring her. She was tall and Avell formed, Avith good features, fine brown eyes, a clear broAvn complexion, and a quantity of silky dark hair. She Avas perhaps a little too statuesque, not possessing that specially classical style of beauty of which a statuesque bearing is allowed to be the fitting complement. Some people called her haughty, others said she was stupid. Certainly she was deficient in small talk, and not unfrequently suffered from that peculiar elevation of the eye-"], [49, "DUNCAN MORAY. 41 brows which indicates boredom in scenes Avhich excited other girls to much liveliness. She Avas fond of dancing, and would have unhesitatingly declared she enjoyed balls very much. Neverthe less it was often in a ball-room she looked dull and stupid, Avhile, if she could secure a chance to Avalk home through the silent streets, under the faint light of the stars, or in the fresh dawn of early morning, she would reach the house, not pale and faded like most of her companions, but with bright eyes, and cheeks tinged with healthy colour. The girl was in fact out of her element, but was not aware of the fact simply because she had never chanced to be in it. Her father, Gerald Elliott, after that mysterious university episode, vaguely defined in Rossan as ' something Avrang,' and Avhich Avas in truth something very Avrong in connection with cards, had wholly disappeared from the country for more than tAventy years. Then he had re appeared, and his face AA7as certainly marked by lines, and capable of expressions Avhich were any thing but attractive. Still he was a fine looking man, and heir of entail to an ancient Scottish"], [50, "42 DUNCAN MORAY. house. The two facts easily smoothed the way to his marriage Avith a well born woman, possessed of a small fortune, and a consciousness of fading youth. Her family had interest enough to procure him some government appointment, and their joint incomes bad enabled him and his wife to live comfortably in a small house off Hyde Park, where Isabel had been born, and where her mother had died before she Avas old enough to have anything but a very vague remembrance of her. A cheerless youth had folloAved a cheerless child hood. From the hands of nursery governesses Isabel Elliott passed to the experiences of boarding school life, spending her holidays in general at the house of one or other of her mother's early friends, who sighed over her a good deal, but did not otherwise exert themselves greatly in her behalf. From the time she was eighteen she had lived at home, as mistress of her father's house. Gerald Elliott had none of the petty meanness about him which is required to produce the domestic tyrant. Of positive sources of worry aud vexation, Isabel had almost none. If her father manifested"], [51, "DUNCAN MORAY. 43 little affection for her, he was at least kind and good natured ; and if he took but little trouble to provide her with any pleasures, he never interposed vexatious restrictions between her and any plea sures she could secure for herself. Sometimes he Avent with her to a ball, but not often. She Avas generally left to make her own arrangements Avitli the mothers of some of her friends for such chaperonage as society demanded. Yet the girl was very conscious that life was a dull mono tonous sort of thing, as far as her experience went; but she Avas very unselfish, and she sub mitted to it Avith the quiet patience AAith which unselfish people are apt to accept evils which con cern only themselves. In truth she saw no escape, for an artificial existence extended to the limits of her horizon. More dissipation, more dress, more in fact of Avhat they had, Avas the Elysium for Avhich her circle of acquaintance sighed. She only felt that more of what she had AA7ould be more boredom, and could but pine in a A7ague in definite Avay for something different, something"], [52, "DUNCAN MORAY. 44 she had never experienced, and could not there fore distinctly picture to herself. All unconscious that she was on the very thres hold of a Avholly revolutionized life, Isabel Elliott had just entered a well filled ball-room, when her hostess came hurrying up \u2014 ' Has your father heard from Scotland, Isabel ?

' I suppose I may congratulate you,' he said. ' I believe your father and his kinsman were not on such terms as to render congratulations in discreet.' ' They were not on such terms, as you may see, that I am forced by the news to retire. But are you sure the report is true ? ' ' As far as Mr. Elliott's death goes, certainly. I heard from home this morning. Southend, where Ave live, is only five miles from Beeclrwood.' ' But about there being no will ? That would surprise my father very much. His cousin cher ished great enmity towards bin. I have heard him say he Avas sure he would leave everything he could aAvay from him.' 'I think it seems to be pretty certain. My father had met Mr. Elliott's factor. He said he believed there was none, and Mr. Elliott's lawyer also thought so. He was writing to your father. I am surprised he has not heard.' ' It may be that he has. He was dining out."], [54, "46 DUNCAN MORAY. There were letters waiting for him when I came away. One might be from Scotland.' With that they moved off through the figure of the quadrille, and nothing more was said until the dance was over. Then, as he offered his arm, Mr. Millar said, ' Will Mr. Elliott be here to-night? I should like to luive been introduced.' ' He thought of coming, but if he has received the letter, I hardly think he Avill. I suppose he Avill have to go to Scotland, and he Avill probably have much to do.' ' Then I hope Ave may soon have the pleasure of Avelcoming you in the wild north.' ' I do not know about that. I have never heard my father say much about Beechwood. I think he can hardly haA7e any very distinct remembrance of it. Is it very wild ? ' ' Shall we sit doAvn, and I Avill try to describe it to you? ' They found a seat. 'Noav,' said Mr. Millar, 'you must imagine yourself to be driving west ward along a high road, and you pass through the A-illage of Rossan. Shortly afterward you turn to"], [55, "DUNCAN MORAY. 47 the left, and drive southward, close under a steep rocky hill covered with pine Avoods, out of Avhich jut, every here and there, great jagged rocks. Presently you turn again westward, up a steep narrow glen. On your left hand, far beloAv you, is a stream, all black pools, and tiny Avaterfalls, and on the opposite side of the glen, just as you turn, you see a great granite quarry, which, with the pine trees clustering all round it, is really picturesque. You drive a short distance up the glen, along a very narrow road, chiefly through pine w*oods; but with so many sharp turns, pro jecting crags, and places where the road almost seems to hang over the stream, that you feel it is a miracle every time you driA7e along it without getting your neck broken. Gradually you per ceive that the road is growing more like a private one, and soon you come to gates, and a lodge. Within there are more pine Avoods, and break-neck places, but there are also clearings, and occasional ornamental shrubs. After a little you reach a sort < if broad platform, partly natural, partly artificial, on Avhich, close to the edge of the rocks, stands a"], [56, "48 DUNCAN MORAY. square turreted house. There is a fair sized laAvn, and some flowering shrubs about it, and there are stables at a short distance. I suppose there is a garden somewhere, but of that I know nothing. Beyond the house again are pine woods, rocks, and the stream, for a quarter of a mile, where the glen abruptly ends, and the Avoods close in above a really very fine Avaterfall. That is BeecliAvoocl.' Isabel drew a deep breath, and Mr. Millar msntally remarked, ' She is handsomer than I thought she was.' ' You are an excellent describer,' she said. ' I seem to see it all. What is beyond the Avoods and waterfall ? ' 'Heather, principally, and granite crags, with plenty of grouse. You see you are to be relegated from the centre of civilization to the heart of savagedom.' ' Yes, I think you are right. Savagedom has, I imagine, a heart. Civilization has only a centre. I like the prospect. But you have told me nothing about the house itself. I have seen pictures of those old turreted Scotch houses. They look very"], [57, "DUNCAN MORA Y. 49 picturesque. What is the house at Beechwood like, inside ? ' 'About that I can tell you nothing. I have never been allowed to profane precincts so sacred Avith my vulgar presence. Mr. Elliott never accorded the entry of his house to such scum of the earth as we are.' ' What do you mean ? ' He laughed, but someAvhat bitterly. ' You have much to learn,' he said. ' I thought, when you received me so cordially, you did not fully esti mate your own importance. The Elliotts are pretty nearly primeval.

Then, as Isabel Elliott turned upon him a glance sparkling with mischievous merriment, Walter Millar got a step further, and said to himself, ' She is very handsome.' ' Well,' she said, ' You chose to liken yourselves to mushrooms. Are they not meant to be eaten ? ' ' Upon my word you are right, and we are eaten, a good deal. I know it is our own fault. But even the very farmers, whom we do not humbly beg to devour us as much as possible, treat us with covert disdain.

The annoyances of to-day are not, I imagine, greatly soothed by the reflection that one's descendants will be exempt from them. I doubt if a patient enduring tortures under a surgeon's knife a century ago would have felt his sufferings greatly mitigated by a revelation of the future discovery of chloroform. Besides, Demos is up and doing. I suspect the saplings of to-day have little chance of ever becoming primeval timber.' 'How much more of it is there about Beech- Avood ? ' ' Not a great deal.

Now I fear I must leave you. I engaged my cousin Annie Lockwood for this dance.' Isabel, promptly declining the dance in order to get rid of an obnoxious suitor for the same, kept the seat where Mr. Millar had left her, revolving all the fresh information she had received. His vivid description had impressed her very strongly. There was not flowing in her veins for nothing the blood of an old Scottish family, with roots at least four centuries deep. To a certain, though limited, extent, she intuitively grasped the social conditions on which he had touched, but she was not thinking of them. It almost seemed to her as if she had once known sombre pine woods clustering over beetling crags, foaming torrents plunging OArer masses of water worn rock into dark silent pools, and wide stretches of purple heather, with grouse sweeping over them in their swift strong flight, and had been pining for them ever since \u2014 as if she had not so much received information, as had slumbering memories suddenly quickened into life. Would her father have to go at once to Scotland,"], [61, "DUNCAN MORAY. 53 and if so would she be able to persuade him to take her with him 1 She almost started when a partner claimed her for a dance. Later in the evening Mr. Millar again joined her. ' I forgot,' he said, ' to mention one of your valuable acquisitions. Mr. Elliott succeeds to an hereditary feud.' ' What, a Scotch family feud ? ' 'Not exactly. It is a question of a fraud. I have but an imperfect knowledge of the story, but so far as I know it, it is that a former proprietor of Beechwood who, not being a direct ancestor of yours, I may venture to mention is said to have been a most uncommon rascal, sold some unentailed land, and then, by some highly ingenious process, contrived to secure the purchase money and retain the land. The dispute I believe crops up every time the property changes owners.' ' Now then,' replied Isabel, ' do you not see how you have proved the advantages of possessing a long line of ancestry ? There is clearly a tendency to swindling in the Elliotts. I am at once warned what moral temptations to avoid, just as I should"], [62, "DUNCAN MORAY. 54 know I must be careful about chills, if the family was consumptive. I begin to see the advantages of being primeval.' ' An original view of the subject, certainly. You seem to have been dipping into modern scientific theories. But it is wearing late.

Mrs. Radcliffe is going to take me home, and I know she is going as soon as this dance is over.' Mrs. Radcliffe and her daughters were full of the news which the hostess had freely circulated. ' What a wonderful story, Isabel. Do tell us about it. A grand old Scotch castle, with miles of terri tory, everyone is saying. We never knew your father was heir.' ' He never spoke much of it.

' We are just arranging a little dance. I want you to be there. You will get your card to-morrow, or next day.' ' Thank you,' replied Isabel, a little coldly. ' I do not in the least know what my father Avill do.' The Radcliffes were not wont to be so gracious. She had never been asked to a dance at the house before. This sudden accession of cordiality failed to strike a responsive chord within her. It was not on account of increased social importance that her new position Avould possess a charm for her."], [64, "56 DUNCAN MORAY. She found her father in the small back room which was his own particular den. On the table lay several letters ready for posting, but he him- self was at the moment unoccupied, apparently lost in deep thought. One glance at his face told Isabel he had received the neAvs, and something- more than that. It told her that for some reason that news was not wholly agreeable to him. The expression of his face was dark, almost fierce, and would have seemed to a keen but disinterested observer suggestive of sinister possibilities. For Isabel it had no terrors. She had been used to see it, at times, from her earliest childhood, but its results for her had only been that her father was silent, and inclined to answer a little shortly if spoken to ; and since she had been grown up, it had merely been to her a signal for a judicious process of letting alone. Probably she owed it in a great measure to her own good sense, coupled with quick observation, that her father's dark moods had never been a cause of domestic dis comfort.

' Yes, I must start the first thing in the morning.' ' May'nt I go with you ? Mr. Millar made me quite long to see the place.' 'No, I cannot take you. I am too utterly ignorant of the state of affairs. They think there is no will. In that case I succeed to a very nice little property, but I can hardly believe that it is really so. If there should be one, I am very sure that the entailed land and the four bare walls of the house are all I shall get. If I find things better than I expect you shall come down at once.' ' In any case I suppose you succeed to the hereditary feud,' said Isabel, laughing. ' I suppose that is part of the entail ? ' ' Well yes, the feud, but not the thing to which it refers.

Then looking at her with a softened face, he said, ' I wish you had been a boy, Isabel.'

It was, therefore, on a bright summer morning, that he saw once more, after the lapse of full five and forty years, streaked with who could tell what dark and sinister memories, the scenes Avhich had been familiar to him in boyhood. All Rossan had been like a tightly strained wire, since the death of the old laird, vibrating from end to end Avith the lightest finger touch. Mr. Gillespie, who held one of Admiral Grierson's farms, had for years acted as factor for Mr. Elliott. No notorious criminal, suspected of relapsing pro pensities, was ever watched by the police more"], [70, "62 DUNCAN MORAY. carefully than Mr. Gillespie was watched by Rossan. He could not post a letter, or speak to a chance acquaintance in the street, Avithout the fact being instantly known throughout the length and breadth of the village. And yet, in spite of this unwearied watchfulness, it was to purely accidental circumstances that Rossan owed an escape from the appalling disaster of the new laird slipping through the village un observed. The weather had been very dry for some time, so the road was hard, and the sound of horses' hoofs, trotting rapidly, and eA7idently fol lowed by some light vehicle, was audible before Mr. Elliott's fly entered the village. A carriage and pair was not often on the road at so early an hour. Rossan jumped to a conclusion, and rushed out of doors. Slatternly women, clutching half dressed babies, flew into the street, pell mell with bare-footed towzie-headed bairns, and dogs ab normally excited by the unwonted commotion. Wrinkled visages peered through windows, and every alley leading to back cottages poured forth its complement of strangely clad figures. In the"], [71, "DUNCAN MORAY. 63 greater privacy of their more retired dwellings, the inhabitants of the back cottages were used to get through their morning work, or gossiping, under comfortable conditions of some paucity of clothing, and they seemed to consider that a shawl throAvn over the head was the uttermost conces sion propriety could demand, Avhen the induce ment to appear in public was a chance of a sight of the back of the fly which might be safely as sumed to be carrying the new laird to Beechwood. ' It's just Gerald Elliott himsel', there's nae tAva ways aboot that,' triumphantly asserted old Mrs. Nisbet, Mrs. Hamilton's mother aforesaid, ' I wad hae ken't him onywhere, though he's greatly aged of course.' ' Desperate gude eyesicht ye maun hae then,' retorted a neighbour, somewhat sarcastically, under pressure of deep disappointment. Her cir cumstances would have enabled her to secure an extra good sight of the carriage, bad she not, in her haste to rush to the door, set down a pail of water she was just bringing in from the back yard half on and half off a low stool, and in consequence"], [72, "64 DUNCAN MORAY. nearly drowned a luckless baby Avhich was crawl ing about the floor, and which she was perforce obliged to stop and rescue. As Mr. Elliott was leaning far back in the corner of the carriage, and both windows were closed, there seemed to be some ground for the sarcasm. Nevertheless Mrs. Nisbet held high revel that day, and during the course of it contrived to remember quite a number of circumstances connected with the early days of the new laird which she had ' had nae mind o' this mony a day.' Heedless or unconscious of the sensation he had excited, Gerald Elliott passed on his way. He let down the window of the carriage as soon as the village was safely behind him, and looked out Avith an air of interest, although the expression of his face did not indicate that the interest was Avholly of a pleasurable sort. The granite quarry he scrutinized closely as the carriage turned up the glen. It was a wholly new feature in the scene to him, and being on the Beechwood estate suggested pleasant possibilities in the Avay of revenue."], [73, "DUNCAN MORAY. 65 Mr. Dempster and Mr. Gillespie were standing at the door of the house when the carnage drew up. ' An ugly customer if he turned nasty,' ' A gey stiff temper to do business with,' were then respective comments as they came forward, with all the gravity befitting the situation, to receive the new land. Had he breakfasted ? Would he take any refreshment? No, Mr. Elliott said, he had breakfasted in Kirkness. He would have nothing before luncheon. The lawyer led the way to the room which had always been the old laird's sitting room, and thither, after giving some directions to the flyman, Mr. Gillespie followed them. Mr. Elliott seated himself, and looked round the room in silence for a moment. Then, with a slight ring of sadness in his voice, he said, 'Five and forty years ago I wished my cousin good-bye for the last time in this room. I do not think a single article of furniture has been changed since then.' ' Probably not,' replied the lawyer. ' Mr. Elliott has long lived a most secluded life. 1 fear he has F."], [74, "DUNCAN MORAY. 66 taken very little pains to replace anything that time has dealt hardly Avith.' ' Was that from personal enmity to the heir of entail ? ' asked Mr. Elliott, carelessly. Mr. Dempster seemed to hesitate for a moment. Then he said, ' I have always understood that he did not regard you with any favour.' ' Have you any idea why ? ' 1 1 never heard him mention your name,' replied the discreet lawyer. ' But I was only acquainted with him for the last six or seven years of his life, and our interviews were very rare, and solely on business matters. Mr. Gillespie can tell you far more about his sentiments than I can do.' ' Did he honour me with very special aversion ? ' asked Mr. Elliott, turning to the factor. ' There's nae twa ways about that, sir,' replied Mr. Gillespie, with all the frank straightforward ness of an independent Scot. ' He had nae luve for ye.' 'But why?' ' I never heard him say man, sir, than that ye"], [75, "DUNCAN MORAY. 67 were nae credit to the family, an' should never touch a sixpence he could keep aff ye.' Mr. Elliott laughed. ' A pretty comprehensive statement,' he said. ' I am not sure, though, that it would take a very high moral standing to be a credit to the Elliotts. However, I am glad to find he had no very heinous crimes to lay to my charge. A stupid scrape at Oxford, into which any hot headed boy, believing himself an astute man of the world, might have got, is, as far as I know, my only offence in his eyes. But his bitterness against me has always seemed to me so out of all proportion to my misdemeanour, that I have always suspected some interested person must have been inventing more serious crimes for me.' ' That is far from unlikely,' said Mr. Dempster. ' I suppose you are aware that your cousin had an unacknowledged family ? ' 'No, indeed. I did not knoAv, 4 There is no doubt of the fact. They, of course, Avould have every reason to fan his resent ment against you.'"], [76, "68 DUNCAN MORAY. ' But in that case my cousin leaving no Avill seems still more surprising. Do you think it cer tain there is none ? ' ' I know of none, and I am not aware that he ever did business with any firm save ours. Moreover, Mr. Gillespie tells me he had spoken to him, quite lately, in a way which implied he had made none. However, we had thought that after the funeral to-morrow we might aid you in making an examination of all papers, and ascer tain what documents really exist.' ' It is very strange if he has left no will,' said Mr. Elliott. ' I fear ye'll find it's easy explained, sir,' said the factor drily. 'Hoav?' ' He had na muckle to leave.' ' Ha. How is that ? Some very good unen tailed land fell in to him soon after he succeeded.' ' Sold, sir, every foot of it.' ' You don't say so.' ' Ye'll find it true, sir. There isn't an acre of unentailed land left, save the Rig Mains. That"], [77, "DUNCAN MORAY. 69 the furniture, an' the estate plenishings are aboot a' he had to leave, an' I doubt he did na think them worth troubling about.' Mr. Elliott's face had grown very dark as he listened. ' But the price of the unentailed land ? ' he said. ' Sunk in an annuity, I doubt, sir.' ' And all the land sold, save the Rig Mains I Why should he have reserved that ? ' ' Wha wad buy it, sir? Nae man wad buy a bit o' land he could na reach wi'oot favour o' ither men. The ground is'nt worth a haet to ony one save him as owns either Beechwood or Craignellan. I doubt he had na the face to ask Craignellan to buy it.' ' Ah ! Then it appears you have some faith in that old legend ? ' ' It was my wife's grandfather, sir, that auld Craignellan treated to drink his health, for he'd paid the purchase money, an' made a gude bargain. He died just twenty years since, a hale auld man of ninety. I've heard him tell the story mony a day.'"], [78, "70 DUNCAN MORAY. ' But then why did that original man never pro ceed against Colonel Elliott ? ' ' That's just what nane can tell ye, sir. I doubt naebody's ever got at the bottom o' the story.' ' Well, it is a matter which must be looked into. Of course, if the moral proof is good, I should not hold out for legal proof. How would the case stand, Mr. Dempster, if papers proving the purchase really turned up ? Could lapse of time be pleaded in a case where a downright swindle was proved ? ' From which question it appeared that Mr. Elliott knew more about the traditions of Rossan than he had allowed his daughter to suppose. Mr. Dempster gave his shoulders an expressive shrug, but made no reply. ' You are too cautious to commit yourself,' said Mr. Elliott, laughing. ' By the bye, what is the people's name ? ' ' Moray, sir,' replied Mr. Gillespie. ' Mr. Elliott's brow contracted, and he sat silent for a moment, as if in thought. ' Moray,' he re peated, at length. ' Surely that is not the name of the original purchaser of Craignellan ? '"], [79, "DUNCAN MORAY. 71 ' Yes it is, sir. David Moray was the first man.' ' Curious. I haA7e not the least remembrance of that name. Possibly, however, I may never have heard it \u2014 only of Craignellan. Moray sounds quite unfamiliar to me, as connected with this country. But if, as you say, Mr. Gillespie, the Avhole of the unentailed land has been sold, the income of the estate must be seriously reduced. If my memory does not deceive me, the best part of the land is of small value.' ' It wad hae been ruinously reduced, sir, but for the quarry. That brings in a gude income.' ' Well, there seems nothing to be done until after the funeral. By the bye, this unacknow ledged family \u2014 I hope there is no chance of any of them putting in an appearance. Does any one know them ? I would like to be on my guard. I suppose I am safe in taking things with a high hand, Mr. Dempster ? ' ' Quite, I imagine. But I knoAv very little about the matter.' He looked toAvards the factor, who shook his head. 'I doubt naebody kens muckle o' them. I've"], [80, "DUNCAN MORAY. 72 been aboot Beechwood this twenty years past ; I never saw them.' ' But then, is the story true ? \u00ab0h, it's true eneuch, sir. There's auld folk mind the woman being aboot the place, some thirty years ago an' mair, a fine looking woman, but a maist infernal temper. They say the laird wad hae been rid o' her lang syne, but for the children. I've heard it said he used to have the eldest son here as a boy, but that's lang syne too. I doubt he maun be a man o' forty, or thereabout noo. I don't think there'll be ony fear o' their coming just yet.' ' Good. Then, if you'll excuse me, I will devote myself to letter writing until luncheon. My hurried departure from London has involved me in a good deal of correspondence. After luncheon I should like to take a look at things outside the house.' The two men accordingly left the land to his business. ' I'm for awa down to the quarry aboot a wee bit stane,' Mr. Gillespie said. 'Ye might stroll down Avi' me, Mr. Dempster.'"], [81, "DUNCAN MORAY. 73 They walked together down the drive. ' Well, what think you of your new laird ? ' the lawyer said, at last. ' That if I'm greatly mista'en in him, it'll be a far sicht better for all concerned than if I'm not,' was the grim reply. Mr. Dempster laughed. ' I'll tell you one thing,' he said. ' There's been something else wrong with him, beyond that Oxford business which set his cousin so much against him.' ' Ye think so ? ' I am certain of it. He overdid the careless indifference with which he asked all those ques tions. He wanted to find out if any stories about him had got wind down here. He's monstrously honourable in his intentions, but if the Morays are ever a sixpence the better of them, I never read a man correctly in my life.' ' Dinna ye say aught against him,' replied the factor, gravely. ' Ye see he is, in a way, under a cloud. It'a nae but fair he should get a clear start.' ' You may be sure I shall say nothing. I only"], [82, "DUNCAN MORAY. 74 give you a warning, because you will be brought into business relations with him. We lawyers, unfortunately, have a good deal of practice in estimating degrees of rascality. Look to yourself.' ' Nae fear o' me,' replied the factor, as they turned into the quarry. After luncheon Mr. Elliott set out on his torn* of inspection, going first through the house itself, over the general condition of which he laughed somewhat sardonically. ' You are right, my friend,' he said to Gillespie, ' the whole of the furniture, at least, would hardly have been worth the cost of the will. Ha ! \u2014 ' They were standing at the moment in a small bedroom looking towards the stables, and Mr. Elliott, stepping suddenly forward, closely examined the window. Then, throwing back his head, he broke into a laugh, so ringing and boy like, that his hearers stood in mute astonishment. ' By Jove ! ' he exclaimed, ' time has stood still here. Do you see that cracked pane of glass ? I did that fifty years ago, throwing up pebbles in the night to frighten my cousin's old house-keeper,"], [83, "DUNCAN MORAY. 75 who slept in this room. Lord how she yelled ! She raised the whole house, and I was never so nearly shot in my life. They never found me out though.' He paused and stood silently contemplating the cracked window pane, and the lawyer watched him with keen observation. It seemed as if the trivial incident had called up a flood of old memories so vividly that they had power, for the moment, to mould even his features and expression into harmony with the days when he was merely a careless high-spirited boy. A strange half wistful sadness came over his face, almost blending with the smile still lingering upon it. Then came a sharp contraction, as of sudden pain, and he turned so shortly that he caught Mr. Dempster's eye. ' Old memories don't do, Mr. Dempster,' he said, ' when one gets to the wrong side of sixty, as you will find if you ever reach that age. Well, it is clear my daughter will find her work cut out for her in the house. You seem surprised,' he added,"], [84, "76 DUNCAN MORAY. observing a slight movement on the part of both men. ' Indeed, yes,' replied Mr. Dempster. ' The impression here has been that you were not married.' ' It will not long remain so. A Mr. Millar, from Southend, was introduced to my daughter the other night, at a ball in London. I am a widower. If my antecedents are held in the county to necessitate it, I can produce certificates of both my marriage and the birth of my daughter,' he added, with his cynical smile. ' But these Millars, Mr. Gillespie. Who are they ? What has become of the Baillies ? ' ' Wadna be content to cut their coat according to their cloth, sir, sae lost baith coat and cloth. The Millars are frae Glasgow.' ' So I heard. Do you know anything of their previous history ? ' ' No, sir. I ken naught aboot them. The auld families are no vera cordial to them, an' I dinna hear muckle o' them.' ' Well, I think I have fairly gauged the worth"], [85, "DUNCAN MORAY. 77 of my inheritance within the house,' Mr. Elliott said. ' Now let us go outside.' Where and howsoever Mr. Elliott had passed the earlier years of his life, he had very clearly pictured up a great deal of just the sort of knowledge which is most useful to a landowner. His remarks showed a quick aud accurate per ception of the ruinous neglect apparent in every part of the estate through which they passed. The prospect was not cheering for a possessor not bringing with him a large supply of ready money. ' Well, Mr. Gillespie,' Mr. Elliott said, when at length they stood again on the gravel before the house, ' your duties do not seem to have been very arduous.' ' The hardest part o' them, sir, was to get leave to do the least thing. Bad as it is, I had mony a fight to prevent it being worse.' ' Certainly it's ill succeeding to a grudged inheritance, particularly when one is no longer a young man. I must make the best of it. I shall be better able, after to-morrow, to see what"], [86, "78 DUNCAN MORAY. can be done. I hope you will find you have more work and less fighting.' ' It will suit me a far sicht better if it is so,' the factor replied ; and then divining that he was no longer needed, he withdrew. ' I am not clear about the succession, Mr. Elliott,' the lawyer said. ' The property seems always to have been passing from one branch to another.' \u2022 Yes. For a century it has been so. The father of the wicked Colonel is the common ancestor. He had five sons. The lines of three have died out. The fourth, in the male line, expires with me. There are I believe two representatives of the fifth out in India ; brothers, the elder of whom is the next heir. I sometimes wonder his enmity to me had not induced my cousin to take steps about breaking the entail.' ' You were an Elliott first, a disliked heir only second, and he had no legitimate relations he cared about. But the idea occurred to me in connection with yourself, since I heard you had a daughter.'"], [87, "DUNCAN MORAY. 79 ' Not for a moment,' replied Mr. Elliott decidedly, * should I think of such a thing. I am an Elliott too. The property which has been in our family for four hundred years shall never by my action pass to any other, as long as a male representative of the old line lives. But of course that very fact makes me feel anxious about my daughter ; anxious to indemnify her, as far as possible, for not having been a son. Is it possible I may be able to do more than as yet appears likely for her?' ' I hardly understand ? ' ' This annuity of which Gillespie spoke. With the rental of the quarry, it must have made my cousin's income a larger one than he can possibly have spent. Do you think there are large accumulations ? ' ' I fear not. I fear he worked very systemati cally against you. He seems to have been really most indulgent to these children, and he had a certain income, from his annuity, and the steady rental of the quarry. I cannot speak with cer tainty, but I much fear you will find that the principal cause of his making no will lies in the"], [88, "80 DUNCAN MORAY. surplus of his income having been made over to them every year. Probably he was the more determined you should have nothing but what the entail gave you just because he could not over come his reluctance to break that.' The correctness of the lawyer's surmise was abundantly proved by the next day's examination. The late laird's income had been an ample one, but the banking account had been regularly cleared off at the end of each year. A few hundreds in ready money, the house, furniture, and the estate fittings, were all that Gerald Elliott would receive, beyond what the entail secured to him. His face wore an evil look when the fact became certain. ' It might be worse, Mr. Elliott,' said the lawyer, with all the exasparatingly complacent philosophy of a purely disinterested view of the subject, ' I have often known heirs of entail worse off. The quarry at least secures a good income.' ' Doubtless,' replied Mr. Elliott. ' The darkness of a dark night is by no means so confusing as the suffocating bewilderment of a dense London fog. I never found though that it made the rail against"], [89, "DUNCAN MORAY. 81 which you broke your shins any softer. At any rate I know where I stand. Now I need detain you no longer. I know you are anxious to get away. I must return at once to London. Kindly take in hand all needful business, and communi cate with me as may be necessary. I will give directions to Gillespie before I leave, and hope I may be able, very shortly, to return for some time. Was that a knock at the house door I heard ? ' ' I think it was. It will probably be the minister. He will [have heard you are leaving Beechwood again immediately.' 'Even so,' said Mr. Elliott, as a card was brought to him. ' It is well. He may be able to give me useful information.' Not wholly of his own free will had good Mr. Fordyce thus early appeared at Beechwood. Deep schemes were maturing in the bosom of his wife, all unsuspected by him. Round the domes tic hearth still bloomed the five daughters, for whom at the best their father would be able to leave but, a slender pittance, and the eldest had passed her five and thirtieth year. Poor woman, F"], [90, "82 DUNCAN MORAY. who could blame her if the thought of that elderly bachelor laird, as she fondly believed, who was about to be established in the house he must find so lonely away up that secluded glen, had filled her with exciting visions of blissful possibili ties, and had caused her to startle the unsuspect ing minister with a sharp rebuke for uncharitable judgments, when, on his return from the funeral, he had reported the new laird to be a fine, but not an agreeable looking man. ' My dear,' he said, ' I form no judgment. I merely state a fact \u2014 which is self evident \u2014 that the expression of his face is not agreeable.' ' Which I am sure you would not have dis covered, had you not known what was said against him. And just for that reason you ought, as minister, to be particularly cordial in your wel come to liim. I think you ought to go and call this afternoon.' ' Oh, my dear, it is too soon.' 'Not for a minister. That is quite different. If he is going away again so soon, you might be able to be useful to him. No doubt, too, he knows"], [91, "DUNCAN MORAY. 83 things have been said against him. Your coming at once would show him you despise such ill natured gossip.' So finally the minister set out, not without some misgivings lest he should be thought intru sive. Consequently, the cordiality of Mr. Elliott's reception was very soothing to his feelings ; but none the less his opinion regarding him remained unchanged. ' There is something sinister about his face,' he said to himself, and I should have said the same if I had met him on the road, as a perfect stranger.' ' It is very kind of you to come so soon,' Mr. Elliott said. ' Yes, it is quite true, I return to London to-morrow.' ' But we shall see you soon again, I hope.' ' I think so. My daughter will give me no peace until I bring her. Perhaps you are sur prised to hear of her. I find there is an impression abroad that I am a bachelor. I am a widower. My daughter is just three and twenty.' ' She will be most welcome, I am sure,' replied the unsuspicious minister, little dreaming what an"], [92, "DUNCAN MORAY. 84 atrocious misstatement he had made, at least, as regarded the woman he held to be one with him self. ' A mistress at Beechwood will be a most agreeable novelty. My wife and daughters will be charmed to make her acquaintance.' 'You are very kind. You have been here a long time, I believe ? ' ' Nearly thirty years.' ' Yom* acquaintance then with your parishioners must be a tolerably exhaustive one.' ' So exhaustive as to be occasionally a little bewildering,' replied the minister, laughing. 'I find myself beginning, sometimes, to mix the different generations in an alarming manner.' ' You will hardly do that in the case of the particular family I am anxious to hear something about. I mean the people at Craignellan.' ' What, the Morays ? No. There is not much room for complications there.' ' That name puzzles me,' Mr. Elliott said. ' Mr. Gillespie says it is the name of the original purchaser of the farm, but I have no remembrance of ever having heard it. It seems to me quite"], [93, "DUNCAN MORAY. 85 strange, as connected in any way with this part of the country. Were the Morays people belonging to this neighbourhood ? ' ' No, I think not. I believe they came from a distant part of Scotland. I never heard the name anywhere about here.' ' And this present man ! He cannot surely be a son of the original purchaser ? ' ' Oh, no. He is his great nephew. The first left no will. His nephew succeeded as heir at law. The present man is that nephew's son.' ' An only son ? ' ' I believe so. No, stay. I think I have heard of another who died young. Probably abroad. I think I have been told one of them went to the colonies. But all that is quite beyond my memory. When I came to Rossan, thirty years since, Mr. Moray was a widower, with one son, then quite a little boy.' ' He is then an elderly man ? ' ' Certainly. I should not think he can be much short, of seventy.' ' And with regard to that old dispute about the"], [94, "DUNCAN MORAY. 86 piece of land. Do you know what view the Morays take of it ? ' ' I never heard either of them mention it. But if you wish to reopen that question, Mr. Elliot, you cannot do better than go straight to the Morays themselves. You will not find in all Scotland two more honourable upright men.' Mr. Elliott smiled, a smile which enabled the minister to feel himself more and more aggrieved by his wife's imputation of hasty and uncharitable judgments. ' I am not altogether sure,' he said, ' about wishing to reopen it. One has occasionally to do things in this world that one would rather not do. I must certainly hear in due time what the Morays have to say. Justice must of course be done, if we can only make out what justice is. At present I have very confused ideas on the subject.' Then Mr. Elliott proceeded to question the minister respecting the neighbourhood in general, with au easy careless air, more as if he were making conversation than really seeking informa tion. It was not until Mr. Fordyce was walking"], [95, "DUNCAN MORAY. 87 home that it began to dawn upon him how very thoroughly he had been cross-examined. A much more rigorous cross-examination was begun the moment he reached home, but it collapsed at the very outset. The astounding information that the supposed lonely bachelor laird of Beechwood was under the efficient guardianship of a daughter aged three and twenty years fell like a thunderbolt upon Mrs. Fordyce's airy castles. They would doubtless struggle out from under the crushing weight of the destroyer in due time, and reconstruct themselves afresh in a manner suitable for this unexpected turn of circumstances. But for the moment she felt herself quite unequal to giving more than a languid attention to the report of Mr. Elliott's interest in the neighbourhood, and honourable intentions towards the Morays. With regard to that subject the minister, still smarting a little under what he felt to be an unmerited imputation of uncharitableness, was careful to mention only what were Mr. Elliott's avowed intentions, keeping hidden in his own breast a convictiou very similar"], [96, "88 DUNCAN MORAY. to that which the lawyer had openly expressed to the factor as to the barrenness thereof of any practical result in any way beneficial to the proprietor of Craignellan."], [97, "DUNCAN MORAY. 89 CHAPTER V.

Her mental activity was enormously in excess of her mental capacity, consequently it was always working itself off in devising elaborate schemes to secure very trivial ends. Her prostration under the heavy blow she had received was but momentary. ' Facts are chiels that winna ding ' ! Mr. Elliott's grown up daughter was most demonstrably a fact of this description. It was clearly one of those cases in which a stout denial of the existence of matter would not appreciably aid the argument. There she was, and she could neither be ignored nor got rid of by a process of ejectment. It was not, however, impossible that she might be got rid of by diplomacy, in which case it was far from"], [98, "90 DUNCAN MORAY. inconceivable that she might, in the end, turn out to be, like other afflictive dispensations of Provi dence, a blessing in disguise. Mr. Elliott, de prived of the constant care and companionship of a daughter, would presumably feel more lonely than if he had never known the advantages of affectionate feminine ministrations. Mrs. Fordyce, strong in the consciousness of being an eminently suitable wife for a Christian minister, naturally experienced a certain sense of complacency in feeling herself thus ready, not merely to acquiesce cheerfully in the trials and crosses of life, but to use them as means to secure beneficial ends. What could be a greater blessing to a parish like Rossan than that the efforts on its behalf of an excellent minister, should be supplemented by the power and influence of his daughter, as recognised leader of society in the neighbourhood. With such possibilities in view, inactivity was impossible to her. Her shattered schemes were soon reconstructed, and she was busily at work while the destined prey was still afar off. She was on visiting terms at Southend, but had quite"], [99, "DUNCAN MORAY. 91 sufficient insight into the aims and objects of the family to prevent her from regarding them as fitting subjects for any personal schemes. But that very insight inclined her now to regard Mrs. Millar as probably a most excellent uncon scious coadjutor in accomplishing her own ends. Southend was at an easy distance from Beech wood for visiting. Walter Millar was a suffi ciently good-looking man of about twenty-five years of age. The Millars had plenty of money, and an ardent desire to take rank as a county family. What could advance their wishes better than a marriage between their only son and a daughter of the most ancient house in the county? She forthwith wrote a letter on some pretext to Mrs. Millar, in which, with a little stretching of the doctrine of the absolute one ness of husband and wife, she enlarged upon the favourable impression made upon both Mr. Fordyce and herself by Mr. Elliott, and invited Mrs. Millar to share her amazement at finding that there was a Miss Elliott. It was sad to think of a girl used to a life of luxury in London being"], [100, "DUNCAN MORAY. 92 suddenly relegated to the loneliness and dreary dilapidation \u2014 here vividly described \u2014 of Beech wood. She only wished she could ask her to come and stay at the manse, until the house at Beechwood could be brought into some sort of order, but that of course she could not venture to do. The only part of this letter which Mrs. Millar swallowed with absolute faith was the most ab solutely apocryphal part of it ; the account of the utter desolation of Beechwood. Old Mr. Elliott would as soon have thought of holding out the right hand of fellowship to a gang of pirates, as to a family of Glasgow manufacturers, whose wealth had relieved the embarrassments of one of the old families, at the cost of their territorial importance, and none of the Millars had ever crossed the threshold. Mrs. Millar was, however, longing to do the very thing Mrs. Fordyce hoped to incite her to do, and she hailed with rapture a chance of getting hold of the Elliotts before they should be come saturated with the county prejudices, of"], [101, "DUNCAN MORAY. 93 which her son's report had convinced her that Miss Elliott, at least, was as yet quite unaware. Mrs. Fordyce had lost no time, neither did Mrs. Millar, and Mr. Elliott had stopped a night on the way in returning to London. Thus it came to pass that the very morning after his return home Isabel received a letter from Mrs. Millar, describing the pleasure her son had derived from meeting Miss Elliott, and the consequent anxiety of herself and her daughters to make her acquaintance, and begging her and Mr. Elliott, in consideration of the ruinous condition of things at Beechwood, to come and stay at Southend, until the place could be made a little habitable. To Isabel Elliott, by nature perfectly sincere, and used in the circle in which she moved to be an accepted, but not an important member, this invitation appeared to be the result of pure good nature, and she looked up with the intention of passing the letter across the table to her father ; but then stayed her hand.

She merely refrained from worrying him ; would do all she could, even to any extent of personal sacrifice, to aid him, if he chose to give her the chance ; and meantime calmly read the paper, until he was disposed to farther enlighten her. At length, with an angry expression, he thrust the letter he had been reading into his pocket. ' What is the matter, father? ' she asked, under standing by the gesture that it was time to speak. ' Is something wrong ? ' ' I should think so. That confounded Eric ! ' Eric was a young cousin of Mr. Elliott's, who had always had a pronounced faculty for getting into scrapes, and to whom Mr. Elliott had really been a good friend. A year or two before, as a"], [103, "DUNCAN MORAY. 95 favour to him, the young fellow had been given a sort of last chance in a business firm in Vienna. ' What has Eric been doing ? ' ' That is just what I do not know. They merely say things are gone wrong, and ask me to come at once.' ' You cannot do that.' ' That is the difficulty. They took liim as a favour. If he has got into any mess likely to in volve them into trouble, I have no right to leave them in the lurch. Hang the fellow ! I'll wash my hands of him for good this time. I must go to the office almost directly. I will telegraph on my way, and find out if I really must go to Vienna.' He began to pace up and down the room, and his daughter watched him with some little sur prise. As a general rule, under pressure of great annoyance, his manner was marked by a sort of stern self-concentration. There seemed now a certain desultory agitation about him which was new to her. She bethought her of Mrs. Millar's letter."], [104, "DUNCAN MORAY. 96 ' Will this help you in any way, if you have to go to Vienna ? ' she asked, holding it out to him. He took it from her hand in silence, and read it, standing on the hearth-rug. ' Confound the woman's impudence ? ' was all his comment. ' I thought it rather good-natured.' ' Not a bit of it. They are upstarts. She wants to be first hand with one of the old families.' ' Really,' said Isabel, ' it is a terrible responsi bility to have a position in the county. Had I not better take lessons in deportment, father? It would be a dreadful thiug if I made mistakes, and did not manifest just the right amount of cordiality according to whether people are in or of the county.' Her father smiled. ' You'll do,' he said laconi cally. ' But about these Millars. Did you ask Mrs. Townley about them ? ' ' Yes. Mr. Millar, as 1 told you, made a large fortune in business in Glasgow, where he had lived all his life until he bought Southend. Mrs. Millar is a cousin of the Lockwoods. Even Mrs. Townley took up her parable. \" They are very"], [105, "DUNCAN MORAY. 97 wealthy, but of course not belonging to a county family, like yours, or ours.\" I was never thus taken into the select circle of Olympus before.' ' All this about the house at Beechwood is rot,' Mr. Elliott said, looking again at Mrs. Millar's letter. ' I grant you I do not believe there is a stick of furniture in it which a respectable mechanic would value as a gift ; but you will not have to sleep on a sack of chaff, or wash your face in a stable bucket. Would you like to go to Southend ? ' ' I would much rather go to Beechwood. Mr. Elliott reflected for a moment. ' Would you mind being left there alone ? ' 'I? Not in the least. Why not let me go there at once, father? Even if you are not obliged to go instantly to Vienna it might be better for you to remain in London for a short time. You could send down all the furniture you do not actually need, or go into chambers. Then, if you have to go abroad, Roberts could finish everything, and hand over the house. I can G"], [106, "98 DUNCAN MORAY. occupy myself in getting things put straight at Beechwood.' ' You are a sensible girl,' her father answered. ' You do not complicate matters when there is a difficulty. But I will at any rate take you to Beechwood myself; even if I have to leave again immediately. Can you start to-morrow ? ' ' Quite well.' ' Good. You ought to marry a soldier. I must go now. If the Vienna business turns out urgent, I will stay at Beechwood one day, to make arrangements, and then leave you there under Gillespie's charge.' Isabel Elliott found it very hard to be properly indignant with the graceless cousin whose un timely escapade had secured for her such speedy realization of hopes she had looked upon as quite beyond fulfilment. But for him, she felt certain, weeks would have passed away before she saw the new home, for which she already longed. And now she was not only to see it in the course of about forty-eight hours, but she was probably to be left there entirely alone, free to roam about"], [107, "DUNCAN MORAY. 99 unmolested, and amuse herself as she pleased. In action, she was a daughter with whom it would have been hard to find fault, and she would have been better pleased had her father's probable absence been caused by some more pleasant occur rence, but as far as the fact concerned herself, it meant merely an absolute freedom which she keenly enjoyed, and the elimination from her life of a certain undertone of discord. She did not fully grasp the fact, that she and her father were incompatibles, but she felt the consequences, sometimes depressing, sometimes irritating. All her reminiscences of specially enjoyable episodes of existence were connected with periods when she and her father had not been together. The reply to Mr. Elliott's telegram was to the effect that the business was urgent ; his presence in Vienna most important. There was little time for any discussion, and when Isabel went to her bed, for the last time in the house in which she had been born, it seemed to her as if it could hardly be possible that little more than a week"], [108, "DUNCAN MORAY. 100 since she had no thought but that it would be her home for many a long year to come. Throughout the journey to Kirkness, Isabel watched her father with some little perplexity, and a more sympathetic feeling than was her wont. There was abundant capacity for strong affection for him lying dormant in the girl, had his self contained coldness and apparent indifference not constantly repelled her, while his attitude of some what defiant cynicism towards the world in general constantly jarred upon her more generous inter pretations of both character and actions. She could be cynical herself, on occasions, but she shrank from that mental attitude, which seemed to accept as a necessary postulate that mean, self interested motives must underly all actions, however apparently free from any such taints. But now she thought he looked worn and anxious, even a little haggard, and he was silent, and seemed preoccupied. The mood at once roused in her a softer feeling. Was Eric's escapade more serious than he had told her ? or were there cir cumstances connected with his accession to his"], [109, "DUNCAN MORAY. 101 cousin's property causing him pain and anxiety, which he had not chosen to admit ? She pondered the alternatives, but she asked no questions, knowing by experience the inexpediency of endeavouring to draw him into any confidential communications. A perhaps somewhat increased attention to his comfort was the only sign she gave of any sympathetic insight into his mood. It was, that is to say, the only sign during the journey. But that night, for the first time in her life, she departed from her usual course of not seeking to intrude herself upon his confidence, or appearing to notice his gloomy moods. She had left the sitting-room for a short time after dinner, and on her return found him seated in an arm chair he had drawn to the window, looking out and apparently sunk in a deep reverie. He did not notice her entrance, and she watched him in silence for a moment. His face was certainly very gloomy, but it had none of its usual hard, scornful look ; it wore a sadder, softer expression than she had ever seen upon it, and which touched her at once, with almost a sensation of remorse. She"], [110, "102 DUNCAN MORAY. come up behind him, lightly passed her arms round his neck, and kissed the top of his brow. ' You look worried and anxious, father, but you must keep up a brave heart. This will be your last trouble with Eric, and never fear we shall get things at Beechwood all right in time. Then you will be able to five quietly and happily there, and occupy yourself in doing as much as you can for the place.' She had acted impulsively, and almost before she had finished speaking an expectation of a repulse had come over her. Her father made no immediate reply, but he raised his hands, and clasped them upon hers, with certainly a carressing pressure. The action was so unexpected, it brought tears to the girl's eyes. ' You are very like your mother, Isabel,' he said at last. ' She gave you the best dower she could give, when she gave you her quiet good sense. I have not much to boast of in my past life, but it is a source of no small gratification to me to believe that she spoke the truth when she told me, on her death bed, her short married life had been a very"], [111, "DUNCAN MORAY. 103 happy one. Perhaps she was taken away from the evil to come.' ' Father ! Why do you say that ? ' ' Faith, I could hardly tell you that myself,' he replied, relieving himself with a half smile from her embrace. ' But she was a good woman, and I am afraid I am, or have been, rather a bad man. There are always endless possibilities of suffering for such a woman, tied to such a man.' ' You a bad man ! ' The girl's tone was one of pure amazement. A girl of twenty-three years of age, who has known her father only as a man of very regular habits, is little likely to grasp the fact that when that father has been past forty years old at the time of her birth, there is room for a good deal of the unexplored in his earlier life. Mr. Elliott smiled, but its usual expression was fast replacing the softened sadness of his face. ' Sit down,' he said, ' I want to talk to you. All my wild oats were sown before you were born, but this return to the scenes of my child hood has brought all my life up again before"], [112, "DUNCAN MORAY. 104 me ; and as I have very little doubt I am looked upon about Beechwood as a sheep of very un certain colour, and you are to be left there for some time alone, it is well you should be on your guard. I do not disclaim responsibility for my own doings, but I do think circumstances were a little hard upon me. My first term at Oxford banished me from my cousin's house. I was a reckless sort of dare-devil, and fell in with a bad set, and with men far worse and more astute than myself, and so got entangled in positions which made me appear far more culpable than I really was. My cousin took a harsh view of my conduct, and the rest of the family took their tone from him, so I had to leave the country, and was doomed to just about the worst possible life into which a young fellow could be pitched. My cousin had \u2014 well, connections, much interested in keeping up his prejudice against me, so if any rumours to my discredit could be got hold of from abroad, I have no doubt they lost nothing in the telling. Heaven only knows with what crimes I may be credited. When I came down"], [113, "DUNCAN MORAY. 105 to the funeral I could see quite well, from the manner of both factor and lawyer, that I was regarded with suspicion. I should like you to bear this in mind, and find out, as far as you can, what is really the impression about me. Isabel looked at him with a somewhat puzzled expression. ' How can I do that ? ' she asked. ' People will not express any opinions about you to me. I cannot ask them what they think about you.' ' Not directly, but if you bear in mind what I have told you, and keep watch, you may chance to pick up a great deal more information than either you expect, or others intend. The remark of one person often supplies the key to some remark of which he knows nothing, or people forget things they have said, and supply the context at some other time. There are very few people in this world can resist the temptation to drop mysterious hints about subjects they wish to keep secret. You can pick most people's brains by merely letting them talk.' ' Why should you care what they think about"], [114, "DUNCAN MORAY. 106 you ?' Isabel asked, with a shade of fine contempt for ' the People ' in her tone. Mr. Elliott laughed. ' You have a strain of the high handed old Elliott stock in you,' he said. ' You will not make a thorough going Socialist just at present. Personally I care nothing at all. It is in my corporate capacity the knowledge may be useful. Now I think you should go to bed. I have ordered the carriage at nine, so you will have to be up early.' That arrival caught Rossan napping. Such rushings to and fro were quite without precedent. How could any decent body keep watch upon a laird who went tearing backward and forward in that way between London and Rossan, to say nothing of the road being soft from heavy rain, so that the carriage, you might say, was right on the top of you, before you ever dreamed it was near ? If Jack Hamilton had not chanced to be on the bridge, just as the fly passed over it, it might have been night before Rossan had known there was a lady in the carriage. Mrs. Fordyce, having become possessed of the intelligence that"], [115, "DUNCAN MORAY. 107 Mr. Elliott had a daughter, Rossan was naturally in a position to regard that fact as a natural and suitable one. Mr. Elliott watched his daughter with much interest, as they drew near their destination, feel ing a little inclined to say with Walter Millar, ' she is handsomer than I thought she was.' She did not speak, but her face kindled into unusual animation, as she took in every feature of the scene young Millar had described to her. When at length the carriage turned up the road leading to Beechwood, and she caught the first glimpse of the glen, with the pine trees climbing up its precipitous sides, as though striving to stretch upward to the blue sky overhead ; of the burn far below, swollen with the rain, and fretting itself into masses of seething foam over the granite boulders in its course ; and of the bold face of the quarry, standing out among the dark foliage around it, she canght her breath with almost a sob. ' How beautiful ! ' she exclaimed. ' Very, by day light. Wait until you have to"], [116, "108 DUNCAN MORAY. drive along this road on a dark night,' said her father, drily. ' Has there ever been an accident? ' she asked, leaning forward to mark the exact distance, at the moment, between the wheels of the carriage and the edge of a perpendicular fall of some twenty feet. ' I never heard of one ; and have not therefore, myself, the least doubt that miracles do happen.' ' Well if the Elliotts have managed to escape for four hundred years, we may reasonably hope the first catastrophe will not be in our time.' She spoke coldly. The sneering tone which her father always had ready for anything approaching enthusiasm irritated her, at the moment, even more than usual. Mr. Gillespie was waiting at the door to receive them. ' I doubt ye'll be feeling cauld, after yer drive, Miss Elliott,' he said, as he helped her out of the carriage. ' I am a little cold. The air is sharp. ' Ay. It's maistly that wi' us in the early"], [117, "DUNCAN MORAY. 109 morning. Ye've brought but little luggage, sir,' he added to Mr. Elliott. ' As little as possible. The rest is coming with the furniture.' ' Just bide a wee, man,' Mr. Gillespie said to the driver. ' I'll be wi' ye this minute. This way please, Miss Elliott.' He led the way to the dining room where a bright fire was burning, and there left them, saying to Mi*. Elliott as he left the room, 'I'll be back in a moment, sir, as soon as I've given directions aboot the luggage.' 'Who is that?' Isabel asked. ' Mr. Gillespie.' ' Oh, the factor. I like him.' ' After such a lengthened acquaintance you can doubtless speak confidently.' She laughed. ' It will at least be some time before I answer him confidently. I hope he will not be deeply offended if I have sometimes to admit that I have not the least idea what he says. But oh, father, are all the rooms like this one?'"], [118, "110 DUNCAN MORAY. ' Much the same. You see what is before you.' ' It is charming.' ' Rather a sombre charm, it seems to me.' ' Not a bit. Those deep narrow windows and thick walls are enchanting. Just wait till I make the room look as if it was lived in. It has some individuality. Not like those odious London houses, where only the furniture tells you if you are in your own house, or any other in the same row.' Mr. Gillespie returned at the moment, with some letters in his hand. ' Business ? ' Mr. Elliott asked. ' Yes, sir, when ye're ready. There's a letter or so I'd weel like to get off by the day's post.' ' As soon as you like, then. I am off again, myself, to-morrow early.' Then in answer to the man's surprised look he briefly explained the circumstances. Mr. Gillespie looked rather grave. ' I'm sorry to hear it, sir,' he said, ' Are you afraid of the responsibility of taking"], [119, "DUNCAN MORAY. 111 charge of Miss Elliott? I can answer for her being discreet and docile.' ' Oh no. I think we'll manage that. But I wad hae likit better ye were here yersel' just noo.' 'Nothing wrong?' ' It's they Edinburgh folk, sir. I doubt they mean to try an' make trouble. I've had a letter, an' I doubt there's one for you, by the look o't.' Isabel rose, with a quick perception that her absence would be agreeable. ' I should like to go to my room,' she said, ' if I knew where to find it.' ' The hoosekeeper '11 show ye. She's waiting to see ye, Miss Elliott. She is Marion Boswell, an' has been here a' her days. Ye maun let her tak' ye ower the hoose, when ye're inclined. She'd be sair pit oot if ony one else did that.' Marion Boswell was accordingly summoned ; a hard featured middle-aged Scotch woman, looking, Isabel thought, the very essence of unimpeachable fidelity, and incalculable crossgrainedness. She greeted her new mistress with most profound respect, so profound indeed, that, coupled with the marked deference of Mr. Gillespie's manner, it"], [120, "112 DUNCAN MORAY. raised a curious sensation in the girl, a sense of importance which she had never before experi enced, and which brought vividly back to her mind some of Walter Millar's remarks. 'Ye're welcome to Beechwood, mem,' Marion was saying. ' There's nane living that ever ken't the hoose wi' a mistress in't. I'm prood I hae lived to see ane o' the auld Elliott blude in it ance man*.' Mr. Elliott glanced at his daughter with some curiosity. How would she receive this un accustomed homage ? Would she blunder, and be graciously condescending in return. Without a moment's hesitation Isabel held out her hand, with a frank cordial smile. ' You are one of the old retainers,' she said. ' I am so glad you are here to tell me everything. I shall have a thousand questions to ask you ; and you must show me all over the house, presently.' ' I'll be prood to hae the honour, mem. Will I show ye the room we've prepared for ye, now ? ' They left the room together. ' Where did she learn it?' Mr. Elliott said to himself. 'It must come with the blood, I suppose.'"], [121, "DUNCAN MORAY. 113 ' Have you lived all your life at Beechwood ? ' Isabel asked, as she and her conductor crossed the hall. ' I hae lived in this hoose, mem, forty seven years. I came when I was a wee bit lassie o' ten years auld, to bide wi' my aunt. My grandmither an' my aunt an' me, we've been hoosekeepers here just a hundred years.' ' A hundred years ! ' repeated Isabel, in astonish ment. ' Ay, mem. There's no mony hooses can tell sic a tale as that. But the Elliotts never had ony o' they new fangled notions, o' changin' their servants like they'd change their gowns. My grandmother was fifty years hoosekeeper, an' then my aunt was thirty years, an' I've been just on twenty years noo, since ever she died. ' You must remember my father being here, then.' ' Yes, I can mind his being here, but I'm no vera sure if I ever saw him. I was but a wee lassie, an' was little oot o' the kitchen an' backyard. This is yer room mem, an' if ye dinna like it ye'll H"], [122, "DUNCAN MORAY. 114 please to choose anither, when ye've been through the hoose.' She ushered Isabel, as she spoke, into a room which looked, she thought, marvellously comfort able, although in a more southern latitude its superabundant hangings might have seemed some what oppressive. The two deep narrow windows were hung with heavy moreen curtains, like curtains hung at the four posts of the bed, the which supported a wonderful structure, composed of all sorts of hangings and flirtings, of mingled moreen and heavy fringe. The furniture was massive, the very chairs were ponderous structures, clad in moreen covers to match the curtains. A vision of her London bedroom rose before Isabel's eyes, with its brick and a half walls, its light iron bedstead, and cane-seated chairs, and she began to feel that having roots was a serious thing. The worst of it all was that all that frivolous furniture was already on its way to Beechwood. What in the world was to be done with it when it came ? ' There's hot water in the can, mem,' Marion"], [123, "DUNCAN MORAY. 115 said ; ' an' if ye'll please to come oot when ye're ready, I'll be waiting to show ye the hoose. There are nae bells, ye ken. Ye canna ring.' She left the room as she spoke, and Isabel at once turned to the window. A splendid view up the glen lay before her, with the quivering silver streak of the waterfall visible through the pine foliage. The day had hitherto been cloudy, but since she had entered the house the sun had come out, and all the glen was flooded with brilliant light. The girl's excitement grew so great she could hardly resist sobbing, in a tumult of feeling she could scarcely herself understand. What strange delusion had ever led her to deem life dull and monotonous ? She was soon ready for her tour of inspection, gladening Marion Boswell's heart by her keen interest and evident delight in the sombre old house. What a mushroom sort of existence her own past life seemed to have been, now as she roamed about within these massive walls, treading the very floors which generations of her ancestors had trodden, with dumb witnesses on every side,"], [124, "DUNCAN MORAY. 116 of the joys and sorrows, the every-day routine, and the startling incidents of their long closed lives. Alas! how long will it be given to anyone to experience that sensation ? The old order giveth place unto the new. But will the new ever experience that strong sense of the continuity of life, aroused by the feeling that you are surrounded ou every side by the inanimate sharers of the daily existence, of generation after generation of those to whom you owe your existence ? Meantime, while his daughter was exploring, Mr. Elliott and his factor were holding council. The moment she had left the room Mr. Gillespie drew a letter from his pocket, and selecting another from among those addressed to Mr. Elliott, handed both to him, saying : ' That is what I got yesterday, sir, an' I'm thinking yon is its twin brisker.' Mr. Elliott hastily glanced over both letters. Clearly the unacknowledged family were not minded \u2014 at least one of them was not \u2014 to sink into oblivion without a struggle. The purport of both letters was much alike, only that to Mr."], [125, "DUNCAN MORAY. 117 Gillespie took rather the form of a warning that he might be called upon to account for any monies which had come into his hands since the death of the late laird. There would be no difficulty in proving that the late Mr. Elliott was a married man, and the usurper, who had so promptly seized upon his property, would very shortly find himself forced to yield it up to the rightful heir, the law ful son of the late possessor. As Mr. Elliott read, his face wore the look which had already inclined the factor to predict to himself that his own con nection with Beechwood would not be a long one. ' The fellow has not a strong case, or he would not bluster so much,' Mr. Elliott said, handing back both letters to the factor. 'But have you any idea if they have a chance to make out any sort of one? They might put me to very serious expense.' ' They've nae case, sir. They ken that fine. The mother was a regular bad one. I believe she is dead. I doubt they've never saved a haet o' a' the cash they got frae the laird, an' are in straits noo.

' Don't be afraid,' he said. ' I am not aware that the family character has ever been such that a scandal more or less will make much difference to it. Has the fellow been here?' ' No yet, but I doubt he'll come ; and that's why I was vexed to hear ye were aff again. He's a low blackguard, an' I'm feared for his coming across Miss Elliott.

We must only try and make sure he does not get into the house unawares. I suppose we can trust the housekeeper.\" The factor laughed.

' He would not know her.'"], [127, "DUNCAN MORAY. 119 Mr. Gillespie pointed to a picture hanging at the end of the room. ' He used to stap wi' the auld laird, as a laddie, I believe.

By Jove, and that is the wicked colonel. Miss Elliott will not feel flattered.' ' Flattered or no, there's nae twa ways aboot it.

Isabel's return from her rambles, at the moment, put a stop to the conversation; and Marion shortly after appeared with the luncheon tray."], [128, "120 DUNCAN MORAY. CHAPTER VI. THE SPELL OF THE NORTH. TT was late that night ere Isabel Elliott found herself at liberty to seek repose upon that ponderous structure which seemed by its solid solemnity to emphasize her own newly acquired importance. The human being who nightly slumbered beneath those manifold convolutions of moreen and fringe, must necessarily feel more of a personage than one who slept upon a frivolous contrivance which anybody could reduce, in a few moments, to a heap of jingling bars. She had had to be instructed, as far as was necessary, regarding the perils which menaced her, as well as to settle certain details of domestic management with her father. These were easily arranged. Marion Boswell and her attendant hand-maiden could do all that was wanted in the house, and there was a gardener to attend to out-door requirements. No"], [129, "DUNCAN MORAY. 121 further alterations need be made to the establish ment until Mr. Elliott's return. Isabel Elliott was up betimes to see that her father's breakfast was prepared after the method he deemed indispensable. She had even remem bered, amid all the confusion of leaving London, to put in her travelling bag a small packet of some particular tea, without which he was convinced that he could not breakfast comfortably ; and she saw it made herself, according to his special idiosyncracy. But having thus carefully attended to his comforts, she wished him good-bye, as he got into the carriage, with a cheerful serenity of demeanour, and undimmed brightness of face, which Mr. Gillespie, standing by, was not slow to notice, and interpret according to his own intui tions. ' What will ye be for doing this morning, Miss Elliott ? ' he asked, as soon as the carriage had disappeared. ' I am going to explore.' ' I thocht it wad be that, sae I just arranged to gang wi' ye.

'I will be ready,' she said, and Mr. Gillespie went his way, in the first instance to find Marion Boswell, and warn her respecting the impending danger.

Prudently deaf to this parting shot, the factor went his way, returning to the hall just as Isabel came down stairs. She caught the glance he cast at her boots, and laughed. ' They are not what my father calls park imposters,' she said. ' He chose them himself.' ' They'll do.

Considerably above the level of the house, so as to catch every particle of light and sun, a clearance, at least of trees, had been made, and a garden laid out. Sweet-scented old fashioned flowers, long banished from the select society of modern flower gardens, bloomed almost in crevices of rock, and beds, in many places partly artificial and supported by masonry, were filled with the common vegetables and fruits required for household use. Peter had even a ' bit of wall ' in a sheltered nook, facing south wards, and confided to Miss Elliott that his peaches were promising well. Isabel looked round in amazement upon this strange grafting of the requirements of modern civilized life upon"], [133, "DUNCAN MORAY. 125 nature in her sternest moods, and at last exclaimed, ' Is there anything here which is like anything one has ever seen anywhere else ? ' ' No vera muckle, I doubt,' replied Mr. Gillespie. I dinna ken if the country's made the people, or the people the country, but I'm thinking though on the surface things is pretty well alike, there's a something underneath that makes life no sae tame and common-place in Scotland, as in England.' ' Have you lived in England ? ' For three years.' 'And did not like it?' 'It was weel eneuch, but I did a deal o' yawning. It's an' awfu' thing to hae nae heather hills about ye, aud nae rocky glens, an' brawling burns, an' rivers that can gang the pace ; naught but fat meadows, an' fat cattle, an' gentle slopes, an' rivers that seem to have grown that lazy they canna' mak' up their minds to get on to the sea at ony price. I suppose it's different in some parts, but I was in the midland counties. Noo we can gang down to the glen.' By a steep circuitous descent they reached the"], [134, "DUNCAN MORAY. 126 edge of the burn, and slowly followed the moss grown path which led along its course. There Isabel relapsed into silence, too absorbed in con templation for any of the voluble ecstasies of superficial appreciation. She was a fair water colour artist, so her eye was trained, as well as naturally observant, and missed nothing of this new type of beauty thus suddenly brought before her. The quivering gleams of many tinted light playing upon the moss grown stones beneath the water, where the sun shone strong upon the rip pling surface of a pool ; the sparkling flashes which danced over the foaming shallows ; the deep soft hue of blue aud purple shadows; the rich but tender green of masses of feathery ferns, cluster ing in cool clefts of stained and jagged rock ; the purple pink of the tall straight pine stems, where the sun's rays struck down upon them through the sombre blue green foliage. She did not miss a single feature of an aspect of nature's loveliness wholly new to her. But when a sharp curve in the path took them round a high projecting rock, she stood transfixed. The waterfall was close be-"], [135, "DUNCAN MORAY. 127 fore her ; a shivering white sheet, rolling in an unbroken mass over the edge of the rock, and then parting into endless glittering streamers as it plunged into the seething foam and clouds of spray which hid the deep black pool below. Mr. Gillespie watched her with growing interest, until at length she turned to him, with a smile. \" My admiration must be rather tiresome to you, I fear. But if you only knew what it is to have lived all your life in London, with no further change than occasional interludes at fashionable watering places, or trips to Paris, you would not wonder.' ' I canna say I have begun to weary yet,' he replied. ' The leddies that find the pine woods dreadfully gloomy, an' the walks sadly ill-kept an' overgrown, an' that canna gang near the fall for fear they wad get splashed wi' the spray, are what I find wearisome. But are ye for oot on the moor a bit, Miss Elliott? It's nae a very lang climb to where there's a grand view.' Disdaining all aid Isabel climbed the rugged sides of the glen, and following the course of the burn, they came out upon the open moor, little if"], [136, "DUNCAN MORAY. 128 any less enchanting to her than the more pic turesque scene below. ' How lovely it must be when the heather is in bloom,' she said. 'Ay, it's a' that. I've been here on bright sunny days in a good season, when ye were glad to shade yer eyes frae the glow o' the heather. Woods is a' weel eneuch, but there's nothing to me like the hills an' the heather. Take it easy, Miss Elliott. Ye've nae got yer climbing wind yet. I mauna make ye talk.' They reached at length the point for which he was aiming, from whence he was able to show her the largest part of the boundary line of the pro perty. ' I suppose it is but a small property,' she said, ' but to me, with ideas limited to a house and garden, it looks a lot of land to possess.' ' Unlucky it isn't land that's worth very much.' ' Where is the unentailed land that was sold ? ' ' That was over in the next county, one or two gude farms.' ' How long had you been factor to the old laird?' .she asked."], [137, "DUNCAN MORAY. 129 ' Aboot twenty years.' ' Then you must have known him very well.' ' As weel as onybody, I doubt. Not that that's saying muckle. He was a strange man, an' did na let onybody get near him.' ' Did he really sell all that land for the sake of those Edinburgh people, or was it partly to spite my father ? ' ' Something o' baith, I wad say.' ' Did you ever hear him speak of my father ? ' Never by name. Noo an' again, in the way o' business, he wad mention the heir o' entail. That was a'.' ' Had he a very bad opinion of him ? ' Mr. Gillespie hesitated. He began to feel that the ground was shaky, and that it was necessary to tread cautiously, especially in his condition of absolute ignorance as to the extent of the girl's knowledge regarding her father's antecedents. ' Yer question is no a vera easy one to answer,' he replied, ' seeing that the auld laird never mentioned Mr. Elliott directly. But I canna deny he aye gave me the notion he thocht ill o' him.' i"], [138, "DUNCAN MORAY. 130 'But why? That is what I want to know. My father got into scrapes at Oxford, which made his cousin very angry with him, I know ; but it seems out of all reason that he should cherish a life-long animosity against him on that account. Had he continued to lead a very dissipated life I could have understood it ; but certainly for some thirty years he has lived so quietly that sometimes it almost seemed as if he were going to become quite a recluse. I know, even from the first days of her marriage, my mother's friends used to say the retired life she and my father led must be very dull for her. Do you think those people got up stories against him, for their own ends ? ' Isabel Elliott was certainly setting about the accomplishment of her father's commission in a singularly direct manner, especially considering that she was speaking to one of the very men he had named as being evidently suspicious of him. But her diplomacy was less transparent than it looked. The discussion of her father's suggestions, as though they were mere hypotheses of her own, was certainly not an unlikely means of securing"], [139, "DUNCAN MORAY. 131 information, if any was to be had. Mr. Gillespie caught the weapon thus offered to him. ' Ye may be sure they wad do that, if they had the chance, but I never heard o' ony thing being said aboot Mr. Elliott, beyond that the auld laird was angry wi' him for his college doings.' ' Well, if anything else was said, it must have been maliciously invented. My father lived for so many years in Germany and Russia, that if he had been as bad as man could be, they could have known nothing about it.' To Mr. Gillespie, himself a middle-aged man, that hiatus of more than twenty years, between the close of Mr. Elliott's brief Oxford career, and his reappearance in the character of a sober citizen, and staid Government official, was a much more appreciable fact than it was to the daughter, who had not come into existence until after the be ginning of this second period of her father's life ; but he did not feel called upon to press that cir cumstance upon her notice. Rather, in the strong conviction which had taken more hold upon him than he could quite account for, that she had a"], [140, "132 DUNCAN MORAY. very black sheep for a father, he was anxious to provide her with a plausible explanation of the circumstances, which might tend to allay any un easy sensations her newly acquired knowledge might arouse. ' They'd be quick eneuch to invent onything that wad serve their turn,' he said, ' an' the auld grudge would gie them a gude chance. It's aye the first mud it's hardest to get to stick. Once ye've managed that, it's easy eneuch to add to it. But that's a' bye the noo. Clash sticks lang by the absent; but when a man's present, an' his ways gie nae colour for it, it soon dies oot. But noo we maun be turning hame, Miss Elliott, if ye're to be back for luncheon. I'd like to take ye hame anither road.' He led her to the brow of the hill, from whence there was a magnificent view over the whole Corran valley ; then, by a steep rugged path, down into the valley itself, and back along the high road to the lodge gates, where he left her to return to the house by herself. He was looking very grave, even a shade rueful, as he walked"], [141, "DUNCAN MORAY. 133 away. A certain glamour had fallen upon him, as upon Marion Boswell, and he was beginning to feel that it might not after all prove quite so easy as he had pictured to himself to escape from all connection with Mr. Elliott, seeing that escape would mean leaving Miss Elliott to fight her battle unaided. It was no very difficult thing for a cautious man to gain the character, in London, of being a very quiet orderly citizen. But, unless he was much mistaken, there was likely enough to be trouble before the girl, living in a country place, which no one would be able so well as him self to help her to bear and to hide. Meantime, while he and Miss Elliott had been gazing down upon Rossan, nestling apparently in such undisturbed calm beneath the shelter of the circling hills, a small social tempest of abuse and recrimination had been raging in that lively village, all caused by the ill-regulated rapidity of Mr. Elliott's movements. ' Eh, Jock Hamilton ! ' exclaimed an indignant neighbour, ' but ye're just an' awfu' bar, to say"], [142, "DUNCAN MORAY. 134 there was a leddy in the carnage yesterday, when the land gaed through.' ' 'Twas nae lee.' ' Hoot ! An' the laird awa' the day his lane ! Wad he leave Miss Elliott by hersel' at Beech wood? ' 'Hoo wad I ken that? But do ye think I dinna ken a young leddy in a braw hat, wi' a feather, frae a man, when I see her ? ' ' Indeed, and it's nae that easy to tell in these days, wi' the new fangled fashions that leddies has.' ' May be no for you. We men are no that easy deceived,' replied Mr. John Hamilton, aged six teen, with the air of an elderly Don Juan. But before his hearer could vent her wrath upon him he was suddenly captured and sharply cross examined by Mrs. Fordyce herself, and her, at least, he so thoroughly satisfied of the trustworthi ness of his masculine intuitions, that she set off for Beechwood, armed with visiting cards, directly after dinner; stopping on the way to interview old Nannie Blair at the lodge."], [143, "DUNCAN MORAY. 135 'Did Miss Elliott really come yesterday?' she asked. ' Ay, she cam'.' ' And Mr. Elliott went away again this morning ? ' ' I wad say so.' ' And left Miss Elliott here ? ' ' She did na gang wi' him.' ' Where is he gone ? ' 'I canna say.' ' Will he be long away ? ' ' I never speered.' Mrs. Fordyce retired, to fare little better at the house itself. The grim visage of Marion Boswell appeared in answer to her summons. Miss Elliott, she said, was not in. ' She surely came very unexpectedly ? ' ' Not to me, mem.' ' Why did you not let me know she was coming ? I should like to have sent a note up to meet her, to tell her how pleased I should be if I could be of any use to her.' ' Vera kind o' ye mem, I'm sure,' replied Mrs. Boswell, with a snort, ' But we're gey weel set"], [144, "136 DUNCAN MORAY. up wi' a' we want at Beechwood. We've nae call to beg o' oor neebours.' Mrs. Fordyce gave it up, and retired. Isabel Elliott was, at the moment, as Marion very well knew, no further off than the garden; but it did not accord with her sense of the fitness of things that Miss Elliott of Beechwood should be hunted up to come and see the minister's wife, as if such a visitor was a person of importance. Her view of the matter was propounded with much clearness to Miss Elliott herself, when on receiving the card she asked why she had not been summoned ? ' Deed, an' I wad never think o' sic a thing. A gossiping sort o' a body like yon ! Ye'll see eneuch o' her before ye've dune wi' her, I'll warrant.' This was merely a casually prophetic remark on Marion's part. Her wildest flight of imagination would never have taken her near the profane audacity of the present workings of Mrs. Fordyce's active mind. ' Is she a disagreeable woman ? ' Isabel asked. ' Oh, no, mem. She's a good natured body,"], [145, "DUNCAN MORAY. 137 vera kind to ony that's sick, or in trouble. But she's ower keen to ken a' aboot her neebours' business.

' ' The son o' auld Adam Moray, mem. Him that has Craignellan, the place that used to belong to Beechwood.' ' Oh,' said Isabel, a little mystified. Like most English bred people, she was profoundly ignorant of some of the most strongly marked differences in the structure of social life in the two countries, consequently, the vision which arose before her was of an English rector's wife, making great efforts to bring about a marriage between her"], [146, "138 DUNCAN MORAY. daughter and a young farmer ; which vision rather prompted her to the opinion that Mrs. Fordyce's gossiping propensities must have had an evil influence on the parish from which Marion Boswell had not escaped."], [147, "DUNCAN MORAY. 139 CHAPTER VII. THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY. nUNDAY came, and Rossan was moved to grave disapproval, sharply accentuated by keen disappointment. Miss Elliott did not put in an appearance at church, thus heavily discounting, had she been aware of it, the chances of any favourable opinion of her father gaining ground in the palish. The weather was lovely, and the spell of wood, rock, and water, was strong upon her. She spent the best part of the day following the course of the Beechwood burn, away over the moor, and far up into the lonely glen among the hills whence it took its rise ; marvelling if it were really possible that only last Sunday she had walked, amidst a throng of well dressed people, along a London pavement to church ; and that a fortnight since, the murmuring pine woods, the heather hills, the wild glens, and the foaming"], [148, "140 DUNCAN MORAY. burns of Scotland, were hardly known to her even by report. She lingered long among those silent hills, drinking in deep draughts of a happiness she had never known ; but conscious none the less of an undercurrent of strange yearning ; that warn ing, hardly intelligible to the young, that when nature in her most alluring aspects enters in and takes possession of the soul, she deepens and widens not alone the channels in which pure joy flows freely, but also those in which pain and sorrow run deep and strong. On Monday it rained, so it was not until Tues day that she set out to return Mrs. Fordyce's visit. In the estimation of that good woman she chose a singularly unfortunate afternoon, for not one of the five daughters of the manse was at home to start a desirable intimacy with the young mistress of Beechwood. She was received with an effusive cordiality, accompanied by a certain vigilant scrutiny from Mrs. Fordyce's keen little black eyes, which had the immediate result of causing her to assume a quiet reserve of manner, and thus to throw a slight shadow on the brilliancy of her"], [149, "DUNCAN MORAY. 141 hostess's visions of the future. A trifle dull and inanimate, not very likely to be very attractive to young men, was the verdict. Naturally topography soon came to the front. ' Yes, we are very proud of the Corran valley,' she said, in reply to Isabel's not very warmly expressed admiration. ' I am so glad you admire it. But I am afraid you must find Beechwood very dull after London.' ' I do not care for London. I like Beechwood much better.' ' Really ? I am so glad. And you will not be quite without society. We shall always be delighted to see you at the manse ; and then you have charming neighbours at Southend.' Mrs. Fordyce's exuberant energy in scheming was already carrying her far ahead of circumstances, and calling up before her a vision of the stately Mrs. Grierson impressing on Miss Elliott that the Millars were Glasgow upstarts, whom she would do well to keep at a distance. ' The Millars,' Isabel said. ' Yes. Do you know them ? '"], [150, "DUNCAN MORAY. 142 ' I danced with Mr. Walter Millar at a ball in London, a short time since.' This was delightful. All unsuspected by her pious soul, Mrs. Fordyce's true inward conviction, at that moment, was that Providence deserved well of her, and was an institution which merited encouragement. ' Indeed ! ' she said. ' 1 did not know he had been so lately in London. 1 am sure you must have liked him very much.' ' He dances very well,' Isabel discreetly replied. ' Oh, but, I assure you, you will like him extremely, when you come to know him better. He is one of those thoroughly genuine people whom one likes more and more, the more one knows them. Such a good son and brother, too. That is always such a good sign. Yes, I am sure you will like all the Millars very much. They are immensely rich, but not in the least purse proud, and so kind and hospitable. I think it such bad taste in Mrs. Grierson to treat them and speak of them in the way she does, just because they are not one of the old county families. That sort ot"], [151, "DUNCAN MORAY. 143 pride is so unchristian. However it is not to be wondered at in Mrs. Grierson,' she continued, expanding into superb breadth of view, ' because she has always lived in one narrow set. You, having lived in London, and seen so much of the world, will have much more liberal views.' ' It is quite possible to live in London and see very little of the world.' ' But 1 am sure that has not been the case with you. One can feel you know the world. You will like the Millars, I am sure; and I am con vinced your influence here will be very good. You will be quite superior to these narrow ideas.' This was a little too much. ' What a lovely view you have from the manse windows ? ' Miss Elliott calmly remarked. Mrs. Fordyce paused abruptly, and sat gazing at her visitor for a moment with a slightly dazed expression ; the connecting link between the beauty of the prospect and Miss Elliott's breadth of mental view naturally not being clear to her. As Isabel, however, sat looking out of the window"], [152, "144 DUNCAN MORAY. with undisturbed serenity, she at length replied, rather vaguely : ' Yes. It is generally thought very fine.' ' And that house away up on the hill, which I saw as I came up the road. What place is that ? The view from there must be very fine.' ' That is Craignellan.' ' Oh, that is Craignellan, is it? ' ' Yes. The place that was once part of the Beechwood property.' 'And what sort of people are the Morays?' Isabel asked, with an undercurrent of mischievous amusement beneath her grave exterior. ' There is only Mr. Moray and his son. They are very respectable, but not great favourites of mine. Farmers are farmers, and I have no notion, because a man's farm happens to be his own, of his setting up for a landed proprietor, just as if he had a regular estate. I believe Mr. Moray is a very upright, well principled man ; but knowing them to be people rather inclined to try and push themselves into society to which they do not"], [153, "DUNCAN MORAY. 145 belong, I have always felt it better to discourage anything like intimacy.' The tone was pregnant with mysterious mean ing. Isabel felt her lips quivering, and rather hastily asked : ' What about that piece of land there is some dispute about? Mr. Millar told me something about it, but my father's remembrances are rather shadowy. Do you know what the story really is?' Then the flood-gates opened. It was long before Isabel Elliott got a chance to leave the house, and she looked very serious as she walked back towards Beechwood. Every possible version of the old story had been poured forth for her benefit, with, at least, the result of providing her with a new sensation. Unless, as the consequence of a sudden attack of kleptomania, there had never in her past life been the most remote possi bility of her feeling herself to be in possession of anything to which she had no rightful claim. Now, although not herself actually the possessor of the Rig Mains, she still felt herself much in that K"], [154, "DUNCAN MORAY. 146 position, since it was her own father who now held possession of land which it was, at least, possible, rightfully belonged to old Adam Moray. The sensation was to her as unpleasant as it was new. Her whole soul revolted against it. She shrank from the thought of even meeting the Morays while such a slur seemed to her to rest upon her father ; and yet, at the same time, she longed to have the chance of telling them how wholly ignorant he was of the true state of the case, and how certainly, the moment his return to Beechwood allowed of it, he would cause a searching investigation to be made, in order to ascertain, if possible, what the exact truth of the matter was. Isabel Elliott was ardent and generous, but she was inexperienced, and not at any time much inclined toward searching self analysis, or it might have struck her that her own restless uneasiness was hardly consistent with perfect confidence that her father would share her sentiments. If a point which had been in question for ninety years, was to be promptly settled within a few weeks, on the"], [155, "DUNCAN MORAY. 147 basis of honour and equity, there was certainly little need for much disquietude meantime. Never theless she did feel a great deal of disquietude, and she was walking slowly along the road, with her eyes cast down, in deep thought, when she was suddenly startled by a loud ' ahem,' very close to her. She looked up, and all thought of the Morays and their claim vanished. A man was approaching, and was already quite close to her, whom her town-bred experience enabled her to classify with only too unerring certainty \u2014 the sort of man to be found hanging about low class theatres, or amidst the disreputable fringes of race courses, and more over, at the moment, she felt convinced, by no means perfectly sober. His intention of speaking to her was very evident, and she had barely time even to wonder what to do ere he drew up before her, and lifting his hat with a sort of insolently ironical flourish, said : ' Miss Elliott \u2014 falsely styled \" of Beechwood I presume.' ' I am Miss Elliott of Beechwood,' she answered"], [156, "148 DUNCAN MORAY. haughtily, instantly aware, from the address, with whom she had to deal. ' Pardon me, madam. I am enchanted to make the acquaintance of so charming a kinswoman, and grieved to dispute her slightest assertion, but right is right. The title you claim belongs to no one save my eldest daughter, and as I have the misfortune to be a bachelor, it belongs at present to no one. I am Mr. Elliott of Beechwood.' ' I have no inclination to discuss that question with you,' Isabel replied, with as unconcerned an air as her real alarm would allow her to assume, ' so you must excuse my walking on.' ' No, Miss Elliott, not of Beechwood,' he replied, insolence pure and simple rapidly gaining the mastery over his air of mock courtesy, ' you will do nothing of the kind. I have just been most rudely repulsed from my own house, where I had called with no intention but to make things as little unpleasant as might be for everyone, and as we have chanced to meet, you'll hear what I have to say.

Augustus Elliott, let me tell you, is not a man to be robbed with impunity, or to allow the name of his injured mother, now an angel in heaven, to be slandered unavenged. I'm not an ill natured man, no one ever found Gus Elliott a hard man, and I would have been very ready to settle this matter amicably, and behave as becomes the head of the family to younger branches. But if I'm not met in the same spirit, why so much the worse for them, as shows they can't appreciate a gentleman when they meet him.' ' This has nothing to do with me,' Isabel replied, firmly. ' But it has to do with your precious father, to whom you'll be pleased to repeat what I have said, seeing he chooses to skulk out of the way. Afraid to face an injured relative I suppose.' ' I shall certainly transmit no messages to Mr. Elliott, who happens to be in Austria. You can"], [158, "150 DUNCAN MORAY. communicate with him through his solicitor, if you wish to do so.' She spoke with an ah* of haughty disdain, aroused by his insolent coarseness, and it was one of the moods in which she looked extremely handsome. An alarmingly sentimental expression began to creep over her opponent's visage, and he looked at her for a moment in silence. Then he exclaimed, ' Hang me, if you aint the finest looking girl I've clapped eyes on this many a day, and as like the old Elliotts, up yonder, as one pea is like another. You can't be Miss Elliott of Beechwood, but if you like to be Mrs. Elliott of Beechwood, and unite the lines, I'm your man.' Incensed beyond all prudential considerations, Isabel would probably have committed herself to some decisive action, but at this moment the evil star of the unlucky so-called Mr. Gus Elliott brought upon the scene a horseman, who came round a turn in the road, close to where they were standing, at a quick trot. The turf margin along which he was riding, softened by the rain of the preceding day, had prevented them from hearing"], [159, "DUNCAN MORAY. 151 the sound of hoofs. He glanced rapidly from Isabel to her companion, reined up his horse sharply, and was on the ground, and by her side in a moment. ' Miss Elliott,' he said, lifting his hat, ' have ye been any way annoyed ? ' ' More than annoyed,' she answered, in a voice half choked by anger. ' I have been grossly in sulted.' The new comer turned on her antagonist, who had clearly no intention of abandoning the field, and a short colloquy followed, which was wholly unintelligible to Isabel ; the speech of both men, to each other, was very different from what it was when they addressed her. But at length, with a glance at her, ' the head of the family ' said some thing in a singularly insulting, sneering tone, and she saw a sudden palor spread itself over her champion's face. Without replying, he turned to her, and said in a low voice : ' Are ye feared for horses ? ' ' Not a bit. But I know nothing about them.' ' That's nae odds. My horse is very quiet. If"], [160, "152 DUNCAN MORAY. ye would just lead him on along the road a bit, I'll be easier able to settle this business, an' I'll follow ye in a minute.' Isabel obeyed, not without some little trepidation, for the speaker's look and tone belied his quietly spoken words. But what woman, from Lot's wife onward, couldhave resisted the temptation ere long to look back, especially when strange sounds made ears strong pleaders with eyes ? Before she was very many yards distant, Isabel glanced over her shoulder, and tasted the sweets of revenge. Her adversary, not a weak looking man himself, but one whose appearance told of the enervated physical tone resulting from habits of dissipation, was vainly struggling in the grip of her stalwart champion, while across his shoulders were falling repeated blows from a heavy hunting whip, ad ministered not only with vigour, but with work manlike dexterity. Isabel's glance had caught the last cut or two, a final shake which seemed to threaten serious dislocation, and a violent thrust backward against a low bank, surmounted by a hawthorn hedge,"], [161, "DUNCAN MORAY. 153 which at that point bordered the road. Into this hedge the victim forthwith sat down, with great force and suddenness, and such a crashing of boughs, that the horse started, and Isabel in some trepidation turned all her attention to him. Agitated alarm should, of course, have been her mental attitude. But her attitudes were not unfrequently far from being those which conven tionality demanded, and her wrath at the insolence offered to her still burned fiercely. Moreover, the fact of her having to act groom while her wrongs were avenged, appealed strongly to her sense of the ludicrous, as did also the final catastrophe to her enemy, and she walked slowly onward, shaking with suppressed laughter, and struggling to attain becoming gravity ere her champion should over take her. He shortly did so, Avith the smouldering fire dying slowly out of his eyes, and as he took the bridle from her hands, he said, ' I'm sorry ye have been annoyed, Miss Elliott, but he does na belong to these parts. Ye'll may be no ken.' ' Yes, I know quite well who he is. My father"], [162, "154 DUNCAN MORAY. had warned me. How can I thank you enough ? I feel sure he was not quite sober, and I am sure he would have been most insulting had you not come up at the moment.' ' Ye've no need to thank me. I doubt he'd been drinking. It was particularly fortunate it was just I that chanced to come up, for I doubt ye'll no be troubled wi' him again.' Not quite understanding this remark, Isabel said, ' I fear, in the eye of the law, you committed an assault. Will he not give you trouble ? ' ' Nae fear o' him. For your sake, I'd no have dared to touch him, had I no chanced to recognize him. Mr. Gillespie had been speaking to me about him, fearing he might come, but nane o' us kent the look o' him.

Besides, I let him ken I knew him, an' would send the police word if ever I caught him about here again, so I hope ye're weel rid o' him.' ' How very fortunate altogether,' Isabel said, greatly wondering who this stalwart stranger might be, who seemed so well acquainted with her affairs, and was at once so manly and straight forward, and so deferential in manner. ' Yes, it was that. But if ye'll allow me, Miss Elliott, I'd like to walk as far as Beechwood wi' ye. Once fairly away, I doubt he'll no come back, but meantime, if he could get a chance to frighten ye, I wouldn't trust him. He's a low scoundrel.' ' I shall be only too grateful if you will,' Isabel said. Then as they walked along the road, she added, ' You seem to know who I am very well, but I have not the least idea who you are. I hope you will tell me.' ' I am Duncan Moray. It is my father that has Craignellan, the house up the hill, beyond Rossan.' 'Oh,' ejaculated Miss Elliott. Again her"], [164, "156 DUNCAN MORAY. English bred, aided in this instance by her London bred ideas, had landed her in bewilderment and confusion. Her conception of a farmer was a generalization on an exceedingly narrow basis of observation, and represented him as a coarse red faced man, who fed chiefly on beans and bacon, was primitive in his manners, and found the psalms on Sunday with difficulty. Hence the unexpected answer to her question caused her a severe shock, and betrayed to her that Marion Boswell's sarcasms might possibly have more foundation than she bad supposed. Had not her sense of decorum forbidden it, she would have liked to ask if that was the horse that always ran away when it came near the manse. The startled tone of her monosyllable was not lost on her companion. He glanced sharply at her. Then, like a canny Scot, he quietly waited for her to make the next move ; and she, conscious that her exclamation must have sounded strangely abrupt, hastened to add : ' It seemed curious I should meet you just at the moment I was thinking about Craignellan.

' She used to take a deal o' interest in it,' Dun can Moray drily answered ; ' but I've no seen her this lang time past.' Isabel felt her lips quiver, but she answered gravely. ' She told me a great deal which makes me feel a great, and not altogether pleasant interest in it.' ' How ? ' The tone was one of surprise. ' She was telling me all the story about that piece of land.' ' Uncommonly impertinent o' her.' ' Oh, no, Mr. Moray, you must not think that. It was I introduced the subject.' ' An' where did ye hear about it ? ' ' Partly in London, from Mr. Millar. But Mrs. Fordyce told me a great deal more.' ' I've no doubt on that point. If ye got the story from her, there'll be no possible version o't ye haven't heard.' ' She was rather bewildering certainly. But she made me feel very uneasy.'"], [166, "DUNCAN MORAY. 158 'How?' 'It is dreadful to think that perhaps there really was a fraud, and that we are actually in possession of what is rightfully yours.' ' If that's yer notion o' a dreadful thought, Miss Elliott, there's a heap o' folk in the warld subject to dreadful thoughts, an' seeming to agree weel enough wi' them.' ' I know nothing about that. It is a dreadful thought to me. But, Mr. Moray,' \u2014 and she looked suddenly up at him with an anxious questioning look \u2014 'I should very much like to know what you and your father really think about it?' Duncan Moray hesitated. ' I hardly like to dis cuss the question wi' ye, Miss Elliott. It seems no just the thing to be talking to ye about the first time I meet ye.' ' Oh yes, but it is, because it was I introduced it, not you. I want so much to find out all I can. It is not half so bad for you, as for us. You have, at the worst, only been defrauded ; we are benefiting"], [167, "DUNCAN MORAY. 159 by that fraud. That is much worse. There is no reason why you should not answer my question.' She did not see the strange look he turned upon her, half sad, half questioning. ' Weel,' he replied, ' it's an auld story now, full ninety years auld, an' what the truth was is no easy to find out. The auld man that bought the place had no dealings wi' his am family, and my grandfather ken't naught o' the matter till he heired the property. But from what he said, my father aye thought there was some cheating over the matter ; but whether it was anyway as the story goes is what naebody can tell.' ' But why was the question never thoroughly investigated ? ' ' Ay, why ? That's just the weak point in the case. If he'd evidence worth aught, why did the auld man no sue Colonel Elliott ? There is some story o' his being feared the Colonel's right to sell Craignellan itsel' was no quite certain, an' that that made him afraid to move. It's true, too, my grand father did find some letters, which showed the auld man had been corresponding wi' a lawyer about"], [168, "DUNCAN MORAY. 160 title deeds. But at best it's little but conjecture, an' I doubt the business is better left at rest now.' ' My father will never consent to that,' exclaimed the girl, vehemently. ' He told me he knew very little about the story. But when he knows how much reason there is to think there really was some fraud, he will never be satisfied until the matter is thoroughly investigated, to see if the truth can be found out.' ' There's only one way that could happen ; by the finding o' ony papers that would clear up the mystery. If Mr. Elliott chooses to have them sought, it will be very honourable o' him. But mind, Miss Elliott, we havn't a shadow o' right to ask it. It's far too auld a story for that. Indeed, wi' a' the bitterness an' heart burning there has been over it, I'll no say but it's better left to sleep. There's little chance to reach any certainty, an' unless our claim was quite clear, neither my father nor I would ever suffer to look at the land.'

' In law, I daresay. The moral question is different. I wonder if it is possible those papers are really hidden somewhere in the house? I think I will begin and search for them.' ' Dinna ye do that, Miss Elliott,' exclaimed Duncan Moray, in a startled tone. 'Why not?' ' Weel, if ye'll excuse me saying it, I think ye're ower young to meddle wi' these sort o' things. They're better left to men that know the ways o' the world. A business that's stood for ninety years, '11 no hurt standing a while longer.

' I'll leave ye now,' Duncan Moray said. ' There'll be no further risk, an' I would like just to ride down to the Carse, an' tell Gillespie what has chanced. It'll be a weight off him to ken there's no danger o' further annoyance to ye.' He raised his hat with the words, and was turn ing away ; but Isabel held out her hand. ' Thank you very much,' she said, ' I will take your advice about the papers. But if they do exist anywhere, I hope it may be I who find them. Otherwise I do not think I am ever likely to have a chance of making you the least return for the service you have done me to-day.' ' Never ye think o' that, Miss Elliott. I hope ye may never need such a service again ; but should ye do so, may it be I that's at hand to render it.' He mounted his horse as he spoke, deferentially raised his hat again, and rode away. Marion Boswell came forward as Isabel entered the gates. ' Eh, Miss Elliott ! ' she exclaimed, evidently in much excitement, ' did ye meet yon ill-favoured"], [171, "DUNCAN MORAY. 163 loon? He cam' to the hoose, an' I'd a rare row wi' him. I feared he might meet ye, but I daur na follow him, for there was na a soul aboot the hoose at the time. Did ye meet him ? ' ' I did ; worse luck for him.' And she related her adventure, to the great delight of the two women. ' That's Duncan Moray to the life,' Marion said, as she walked up the drive with her young mistress. ' He's a braw lad as ony in the country side.' ' Do you call him a lad ? ' Isabel asked, laughing. ' Weel, mem, ye see, I kent him fine as a laddie at the schule, an' one forgets hoo time passes. But he was aye a fine fellow, an honest God searing man, that nane could say had wianged them a haet, an' kind hearted forbye. An' there's nae a better son in a' Scotland. The auld man could na be better lookit after if he'd a daughter at hame. The notion o' his taking ane o' they chattering Fordyces indeed! The woman that gets Duncan Moray should be a glide yin, for she'll be a lucky yin.'"], [172, "164 DUNCAN MORAY. The rival confidences were infinitely amusing, but Isabel discreetly kept them to herself. She had plenty to occupy her thoughts that evening. She was fond of watching, and reflecting upon the ways of human beings, and the ordinary class of men she had come in contact with in society, had not in general impressed her very favourably. In appearance she deemed them monotonous, like the interminably repeated houses of the London streets and squares, and it seemed to her as if this monotony went even deeper, as if their souls were as carefully clad, according to the last new fashion for the special occasion, as were their bodies ; and that they were negligent or deferen tial, facetious or tender, as much to order, as their appearance in shooting, frock, or dress coats. It must, however, be allowed, that her range of obser vation had been limited, while she herself, in her London aspect, had not always been singularly attractive. A man whose partner in a ball-room involuntarily betrays that she is bored, is naturally forced rather to behave as he ought, than as he is inclined. Now, however, she had lighted upon a"], [173, "DUNCAN MORAY. 165 wholly new type of character. This man so chivalrous, manly, and straightforward, so honour able and upright in his sentiments, so fearlessly independent in speech and demeanour, yet so thoroughly courteous and well mannered, without any of the superficial polish by which she had been wont to measure social standing, was a revelation to her. His manner, sentiments, and opinions, were not clothes put on to suit different occasions, they were a part of himself. Or, if the metaphor be more fitting, he had not been ground upon the whet-stone of society, and veneered with the polish of social traditions. He was one homo geneous whole, from his slightest outward word or acts, to his deepest lying mental or moral quality. Isabel Elliott felt strongly attracted, and wondered if the altered social conditions in which she found herself would allow her to see enough of him, to let her make him the subject of a little moral vivisection."], [174, "166 DUNCAN MORAY. CHAPTER VIII. ARISTOCRACY AND PLUTOCRACY. T\\UNCAN Moray rode slowly down the valley -*-^ in search of Mr. Gillespie, with a somewhat grave even anxious look upon his face, until, at length, descrying the man he was in search of in a field at a little distance, he dismounted, and tying his horse to the gate, walked across and joined him. The factor received his account of the after noon's occurences with exuberant delight. ' Eh, man, but that's the best thing I've heard this mony a day. I hope ye laid it weel on to him.' ' I wad say so. My arm's no just a weak one, an' the whip's no a leddy 's switch. I doubt he'll be desperately disinclined to lie on his back this some time, an' I'll lay he doesn't show his ugly face about here again.'

Then with sudden gravity he added, ' Yon's an ugly customer, Moray, or I'm greatly mistaken.' ' I doubt ye're no that, ony way.' ' Ye've no seen him ? ' ' Yes, I have. I was at Kirkness Station the day he went off. He was sitting on a bench, making notes an' calculations wi' a pencil, so I had a gude chance to watch him a bit ; an' an ugly looking customer he is, there's nae twa ways about that. But I'm troubled about the young leddy, Gillespie.' 'How?' ' Weel, she'd been awa at the manse, an' that chattering auld pyet had been telling her about the Rig Mains story. She'd been saying something about me, too.' ' Hoo awfu' blate ye were wi' yer wooing, likely,' said the factor, with a laugh. ' Blate ! A man had need be blate when it's his only chance to keep clear o' bigamy. A reckless chiel wad find himself married to the whole lot of them, before ever he ken't he'd ceased to be a bachelor. But that's nae odds. The thing I'm"], [176, "168 DUNCAN MORAY. vexed about is her having got hold o' that story. She'd heard some rumours o't before, but she said her father said he knew very little about it.' ' Hoot, man. He ken's a' aboot it just as weel as need be.' ' Well, that just makes the matter worse. He has made her believe he doesn't, and she's as troubled at the thocht we've maybe been defrauded as the maist o' people wad be if the loss was their ain ; an' she's so certain her father will feel just the same that she wanted to begin hunting for the papers at once.' ' Gude sake, she mauna do that,' exclaimed the factor, in much alarm. ' I tauld her that. I tauld her fair out she was ower young to meddle wi' such matters, an' that the. business could weel bide till the laird came hame. But the thing that troubles me so much is the way she has committed her father. She's gone bail for him that he'll be as honourable as hersel' an' nae thole to haud property unless he is quite certain his title is gude ; an' I'm feared she'll haud"], [177, "DUNCAN MORAY. 169 it a sort o' disgrace if he falls short o' what she has claimed for him.' The factor shrugged his shoulders. ' There's nae way to help that,' he said. ' An' mind ye, Moray, I'm bound to allow the laird spoke fair an' honourably eneuch himself aboot the matter.' ' I daresay, so has mair than one o' his kin, an' naething has ever come o't yet. But that's no the question. What's wanted is to stop Miss Elliott saying onything to him aboot it.' ' I see nae way to manage that.' ' Weel, I think I do. I've been turning it over since I left her. I think ye might manage it fine. Tell her that as I've done her a bit o' a service to-day, if the laird should find her eager about the matter, he couldn't, but suspect I'd been trying to turn that to account. Persuade her to let the thing rest until it comes up in some natural sort o' a way.' ' That'll only pit aff the evil day.' ' It'll do mair than that. It'll gie us time to see what like the laird really is.

He'll fall in love wi' her, the moment he sees her.' ' Gude, save us, man ! ' exclaimed the factor, ' I doubt ye're ower heid yersel ! That'll nae help Craignellan to a mistress, though, if it did, it wad settle the land question fine.' Duncan Moray received this thrust with un moved composure, ' Craignellan's dune weel wi' nae mistress for nigh on thirty years,' he said, ' an' it'll nae come to ruin for want o' one this some time, sae if I did make a fool o' mysel', there wad be nae great harm dune. But ye'll speak to Miss Elliott, will ye no, Gillespie, an' tell her what I said?

But I doubt we'll nae be able to keep her from having a sair heart before long. However, we can but do our best.' With that Duncan Moray remounted his horse, and rode slowly up the valley again, sunk in pro found thought. Although he had been proof against female charms, he was no misogynist. He was a keen observer, and, in his way, a great admirer of women. More than one bright, frank, pleasant farmer's daughter of his acquaintance, who neither giggled nor gossiped, and was devoid of self-conscious affectation, would have been rather astonished to know how highly Duncan Moray estimated her. Also he greatly admired Mrs. Grierson's aristocratic stateliuess, and the graceful ways of certain simply clad damsels who visited at the Rowans, and whom he was wont to contrast with grim amusement against the over florid ornamentation of Southend. But Isabel Elliott was a type as wholly new to him, as he was to her ; a girl of too much individuality to be"], [180, "DUNCAN MORAY. 172 run into any special groove, whose unconscious dignity was merely the expression of inate nobility, and whose ease of manner sprang from a happy union of genuine kindliness, and total absence of all self-consciousness, giving her both the power and the will to adapt herself to any society into which she might be thrown. If there be a region in which those sudden moral and spiritual revolutions in a man's life which are wholly internal, cause upheaval and disturbance, such portion of that region as was concerned with Duncan Moray must have been in a state of violent convulsion that day. For all he looked so cool and composed, his whole life had been violently revolutionized. Mr. Gillespie's random shaft had struck an earnest fact. He had turned his horse's head down the Corran valley, merely aware that such a person as Isabel Elliott existed ; he rode back up it calmly determined that if she did not become his wife no woman should. Why the preposterous absurdity of the idea did not strike him, let those decide, who can explain why it is that the most extravagant"], [181, "DUNCAN MORAY. 173 purposes do thus seize upon the least whimsical and capricious people. He formed no deliberate plan for carrying out his strange determination. He merely held firmly to it, prepared to bide his time, with no further ground for confidence than a strong inward conviction, perhaps strengthened by experience, that most things come to those who wait for them in patient unswerving resolution ; that people oftener fail of their desires through trying too much, than too little, frustrating their own purposes through revealing them. He would neither reveal nor renounce his purpose, but quietly wait until time should place within his grasp some chance to carry it out. Just as he was passing the quarry the Millar carriage, a trifle too resplendent with paint, varnish, and silver-mounted harness, passed him, and turned up towards Beechwood. Duncan Moray smiled quietly. ' Ye'll no suit,' he said to himself, thinking, in reality, of Walter Millar, a young man far from unlikely to take the fancy of many girls, but against whose chance of ever finding favour in Isabel Elliott's eyes he would"], [182, "174 DUNCAN MORAY. have staked a good deal. ' A man wad hae to show he was richt gude metal a' through, and rang true frae crown to fit, or ever she wad gie him a thocht.' In what way he was to secure a chance of making manifest to Isabel Elliott his own possession of these necessary requisites to secure her favourable attention did not seem very clear. But he was looking very well satisfied as he rode through Rossan on his way home. Mrs. Millar, meantime, accompanied by her daughters, had burst in upon Isabel Elliott with a tornado of rapturous welcome. ' So delighted we have found you at home. We came rather late on purpose. We have been dying to know you ever since my son told us he had met you. I am so sorry, dear Miss Elliott, you could not come to us. It must be so dread fully dull. They tell me Mr. Elliott has been obliged to leave again.' ' Yes. Important business had forced my father to go to Vienna.' ' How unfortunate ! You will surely reconsider"], [183, "DUNCAN MORAY. 175 your determination, and let me send the carriage for you to-morrow.' ' Oh yes, do,' echoed the daughters. ' It would be charming.' Against this sort of torrent Isabel was very proof. With much calm composure she thanked Mrs. Millar for the invitation. ' I cannot leave home just at present,' she said, ' but Avhen I have got things a little into order, I shall be very pleased to spend a few days with you.' ' But are you not frightened to be here all alone? ' ' What should I fear ? We do not possess a ghost.' ' Oh, but burglars \u2014 all that sort of thing. I should never close my eyes.' Isabel laughed. ' Mine are less obedient. They would close in spite of me. The air makes me very drowsy. Besides I have confidence in the judiciousness of burglars. They would not come to a house in which there is nothing worth stealing.' \u2022 Well, I am sure you are very courageous ; quite a heroine. At any rate we may count upon your"], [184, "176 DUNCAN MORAY. going with us to the Masonic ball in Kirkness, may we not ? ' Isabel's prompt refusal was the signal for a fresh chorus of lamentation. The whole thing was overdone, and as the flood of small talk flowed on, her manner grew more cold, and her expression more inanimate, until Mrs. Millar wondered what could have induced Walter to say she was hand some. A fine figure, certainly, but a dull un interesting girl. Unexpectedly, however, a new act in the drama unfolded itself. The door opened, and Marion announced \u2014 ' Mrs. Grierson, The Millar torrent of volubility suddenly con gealed. A keen spiritual ear might almost have caught the clatter of their moral and mental accoutrements, as they stood to attention. A tall slight elderly woman entered, with that perfect repose of manner which indicates an exactly defined social position, and entire satisfaction therewith. The mingled grace and dignity of her carriage, certainly gave the sanction of refined"], [185, "DUNCAN MORAY. 177 taste to Duncan Moray's profound admiration. She came forward, and smilingly took both Isabel's hands. ' Do you know,' she said, ' that in times long gone the Elliotts and the Griersons robbed, maimed, and murdered each other on every possible opportunity. Let us close the strife of centuries with the kiss of peace.' She lightly kissed Isabel's forehead. ' Thrice welcome, daughter of an ancient race, to the home of your ancestors ; and forswear for ever on behalf of the Griersons dirk, dagger, and poison.' She seated herself with a merry laugh. Then slightly starting, she acknowledged Mrs. Millar and her daughters. ' I did not see your carriage,' she said, ' I did not dream of finding you here. I hope you are all well at Southend.' Hardly waiting for an answer, she turned again to Isabel. 'Do you know that you are the first mistress Beechwood has had for a hundred years ? The Admiral says so, and he is a tremendous antiquarian. Never was such an epidemic of bachelor or widowerhood as has beset the family. M"], [186, "178 DUNCAN MORAY. One really wonders if the widowerhood was always fairly attained. I suppose it must have been or you would have had a ghost. I believe the wicked Colonel poisoned his wife, but that was abroad, so it does'nt matter. His mother must have been the last mistress of Beechwood the Admiral says.' ' How very interesting, and important,' said Mrs. Millar, with a faint attempt at sarcasm. ' Certainly not the second, and the first only to those concerned,' replied Mrs. Grierson. ' These trifling incidents can have no interest save for the families in which they happen.' Then Mrs. Millar, chancing to glance at Isabel, made the same mental comment her son had done. ' Why she is much handsomer than I thought.' A sudden animation had replaced her statuesque composure, and she replied with some vivacity. ' I really know nothing about the matter. I am far too certain that my ancestors were largely recruited from the noble army of scamps to feel any inclination to investigate their doings. One thing I know about my countrymen, from personal"], [187, "DUNCAN MORAY. 179 observation,' she added, pointedly addressing Mrs. Millar, ' and that is that, as a rule, they dance extremely well. I cannot tell you how I enjoyed a waltz with Mr. Walter Millar.' ' Oh yes, Walter was always a very good dancer, and I can assure you he quite raves about your dancing.' And then Mrs. Millar, enchanted, carried off the conversation to London, and her cousins the Lockwoods, and those charming friends of Miss Elliott's, the Townleys. But Isabel held the scales with a fair hand, and was very soon personally addressing Mrs. Grierson again about some topic in the immediate neighbourhood. Mrs. Millar very shortly rose to leave. ' My dear Miss Elliott,' Mrs. Grierson said, as soon as they were alone, ' I am quite distressed that that dreadful woman has got the start of me ; aud you already know the son. I came with the express purpose of warning you against them.' ' Indeed.' ' Yes, indeed. You must be very careful with them. Keep them at a distance, or you will find them insufferable.'"], [188, "180 DUNCAN MORAY. ' I find them very good natured.' ' Very anxious to pay you attentions.

She wants to draw you into an intimacy, just as a stepping-stone to the county society. You must be very careful.' ' How in the world would that help her ? My father is not a rich man. We cannot afford to give large entertainments. I do not think we shall be a very valuable addition to the county's stock of extra select society.' ' Rich or not, you are free of the county. Not a soul but will be glad to welcome the Elliotts of Beechwood. It is only people like the Millars that have to pay their footing.

Of course these sort of people are breaking in everywhere, but we are rather clear of them here, and the old families hold well together. You must not be a traitor to your class, my dear.' ' I would rather be a traitor to my class, than face self contempt, Mrs. Grierson. The Millars were the first people to offer us any good offices.' The champion of the select few coloured slightly, although neither by emphasis nor intonation did Miss Elliott's words suggest the least touch of sarcasm. ' Just to serve their own ends,' she replied. ' Treat them as they have tried to treat you. Make use of them, but do not let them use you to your own disadvantage.' 'I do not think it quite does to shake off au obligation by impugning its motives. Mrs. Millar has been very kind and friendly, and until I see that she has ulterior ends in view, I am bound to give her credit for being sincere. If she is really what you describe, I think I am not very likely to see much of her. She will soon find out we are not likely to be of much use to her.'"], [190, "182 DUNCAN MORAY. Mrs. Grierson shook her head as she rose to go. ' I believe you are tainted with modern levelling notions,' she said. ' However, now you are in your proper place, you will soon shake them off. In jthe meantime, beware what you do. Do not go and commit yourself to positions from which you will find it difficult to draw back. Good-bye.

If you can walk so far, some fine day, to luncheon, I will drive you home again. I will write and arrange it. And now mind you do not commit yourself.' With that she took her departure, and Isabel went and stood at the window, looking rather serious. Her afternoon experiences had been varied, but this last episode was a little dispiriting. In her sophisticated innocence, if such an expres sion may be allowed, she had imagined that these social jealousies and back-bitings belonged only to"], [191, "DUNCAN MORAY. 183 great Babylon ; that the inhabitants of Arcadia, if they did not actually dwell together, like brethren, at least refrained from hating each other like enemies ; and she had been somewhat rudely dis enchanted. She was not particularly attracted by either of her guests. Social free masonry made her instinctively conscious that she and Mrs. Grierson were products of the same social mould, but she did not feel entirely drawn towards her, any more than towards Mrs. Millar. Her sentiments were, in fact, confirming the accuracy of the audacious Duncan Moray's calculation. Neither visitor rang quite true, so, neither wholly pleased her. It had not needed Mrs. Grierson's warnings to make her feel a little suspicious of Mrs. Millar's rather exaggerated cordiality, although not the faintest suspicion of her true aims ever crossed her mind. But there was a little of the dull unresonance of base alloy in Mrs. Grierson herself. It was not so much the individual Miss Elliott she was ready to welcome, as Miss Elliott of Beechwood, who was to be accorded her place in a narrow exclusive circle, probably not without some trace of the"], [192, "184 DUNCAN MORAY. motive Walter Millar had suggested. Arcadia was losing nothing of its fascination as her acquaintance with it increased, but she began to perceive a strong probability that she might tire greatly of some of its inhabitants. By the time she went upstairs to get ready for tea she had quite arrived at the conclusion that of all the peo ple she had met since she left London, Duncan Moray was the one she liked best. A candid admission, going far to prove what a very long way he had been from exciting in her any senti ment in the faintest degree approximating to his own. She had been of course examined and catalogued herself. 'Proud, and rather stupid, I should say,' was the dictum of one of the Millar girls. ' How in the world could Walter say she was handsome?' ' Oh, I don't know,' put in Mrs. Millar. * You did not catch the expression of her face when she caught up Mrs. Grierson so short. That's a girl with a deal of character. I could fancy her look ing superbly handsome in certain moods. And"], [193, "DUNCAN MORAY. 185 she is certainly a stately, distinguished looking girl.' 'Well, mother, if you want to have her for a daughter-in-law, you will certainly have to do all the wooing. I am sure Walter will never have the courage to attempt it.' ' Don't talk nonsense,' replied Mrs. Millar, a little sharply. ' These stately sort of people are quite different when you come to know them well, and just as easy to get on with as anyone else.' ' Well, and what of Miss Elliott ? ' asked Admiral Grierson, when he joined his wife in the drawing room, before dinner. ' A handsome girl, and a thorough Elliott. Those stories about his having capped his offences with a low marriage must be all nonsense, I am sure.' ' Did you ask her to come and stay ? ' ' Oh, no, one has to be cautious.

I gave her a warning, but I doubt if she will take it.' ' Oh, well,' replied the Admiral, easily, ' she'll find out her place fast enough, and then she'll soon let them drop.

There was a law suit mixed up in the business. He was himself quite uncer tain how long he might be detained. Isabel did not feel in the least depressed.

One rather obtrusively gilt lounging chair, which had been a present to herself, chancing to get pushed close beside an 'old oak arm chair in the Beechwood drawingroom, struck her irresistibly as bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs. Millar, in immediate contact with Mrs. Grierson. The altering and arranging required to enable her to get all these new comers stowed away in as unobtrusive useful ness as possible, cost her time and labour enough to make her days pass rapidly. The missing papers were often in her thoughts, and though she faithfully abode by Duncan Moray's advice, to make no effort to find them, she none the less indulged in a secret hope she might chance to light accidentally upon them. There was something delightfully romantic in the thought of discovering, quite unexpectedly, some hidden receptacle, and drawing forth a bundle of"], [197, "DUNCAN MORAY. 189 old dirty faded looking papers. But Mr. Gillespie threw cold water on all such visions. ' I doubt ye'll hae to try some where else for a bit o' a romance, Miss Elliott,' he said. ' The notion o' they papers being in the house at all has aye seemed to me the silliest part of the whole story. If they ever existed, ye may be sure they wern't left here, but put safe awa' some where, where they could be lighted on handy ; an' I doubt there'll never be onything mair known than is known noo. It's ill wark speering about a matter when only a year or twa has gaen by, let alane one that's near on to its century.' Isabel reflected in silence a few moments. Then she suddenly asked. ' Is Mr. Duncan Moray married ? ' 'No.' ' Is he likely to marry ? ' ' I canna say. He seems in nae hurry. It has'nt been for want o' chances.' A flash passed over Isabel's face. 'Only his horse always ran away,' she said. < Oh ye've heard that story, have ye ? ' said Mr."], [198, "DUNCAN MORAY. 190 Gillespie, with a hearty laugh. ' That's an auld tale in Rossan.' 7 Yes, you see I have been picking up gossip. But I wish he would marry. Then I would try and persuade my father to give him the land as a wedding present. He could hardly refuse it, if it was done in that way. And then the business would be settled.' ' Puir lassie,' was the factor's mental comment ; and he was turning to leave the room, when Isabel asked him \u2014 ' Can you tell me where is the best place to get a good sketch of the house ? I mean a view from a little distance. An old aunt of my mother's wants me to send her one. I want to make one that will give her some idea of the country round, as well as of the house itself.\" 'The best place for that wad be frae some o' the fields near about Craignellan. Ye get a gude distant view o' the hoose, an' a fine one o' the hills too. It's the best view from onywhere aboot.' ' But how am I to get there ? ' ' Ye maun gang a wee bit down the road, an'"], [199, "DUNCAN MORAY. 191 strike the footpad across the valley. Ye'll get ower the river on a footbridge, an' then the path tak's ye fan* up the hill, nae far aff the hoose at Craignellan. Frae ony o' the fields up there ye get a fine sicht o' the hoose. Mony a visitor at the Rowans gangs up there to sketch.' Thus advised, Isabel set off one morning, sketching block in hand, to seek a suitable place for her purpose. She duly crossed the river, and ascended the hill, and then she wandered here, and she wandered there, in all the bewildering uncertainty resulting from imperfect topographical knowledge. She had no sooner lighted on a desirable spot, than she immediately found another which seemed a much better one, only to discover, after a few minutes survey, that it lacked some special advantage appertaining to the first. She found herself at length growing quite confused, and resolved, should a new site for which she was making not at once commend itself, that she would give up the search for that day, and return again at some future time. Between her and the spot she wanted to reach"], [200, "192 DUNCAN MORAY. there was a stone dyke, and she was searching for a place at which she might get over it, when she heard a voice at a little distance behind her say \u2014 ' Wait a moment, Miss Elliott. It's no safe for ye to meddle wi' that dyke.' She turned round, recognizing the voice. Duncan Moray was close to her, having hastened forward, before his father, to prevent her from making a perilous attempt. ' Ye mustn't try to get over that dyke,' he said, lifting his hat as he came up to her. ' It's but rotten, an' ye might get a nasty fall. I doubt ye're looking for a place to sketch from. My father's just coming to speak to ye, if ye'll wait a moment.' Thus fortune so far smiled on Duncan Moray and his schemes. By pure accident his father and Isabel Elliott were brought into contact far sooner than he had ever dreamed might be even possible. Adam Moray, coming up immediately, received from Isabel, to the great satisfaction of his son, a most frank and cordial greeting. Whether or not the old man lost his heart, as predicted, Miss"], [201, "DUNCAN MORAY. 193 Elliott lost hers on the spot. As distinct as the traces left upon her father's face by a veiy different life, were those which, at seventy years of age, one of upright honourable dealing, and genial kindliness, had stamped upon Adam Moray's, and she was as quick to note the result in the one case, as she was naturally unobservant of it in the other. His manner was very attrac tive. It had all the inate courtesy which had struck her in his son, only tinged with the greater amount of friendly cordiality which his age rendered permissible. ' I doubt ye'll be for making a sketch o' Beech wood House, Miss Elliott,' he said. ' Have ye found a place that suits ye ? ' ' Well, in truth I have found so many that I am quite bewildered which to choose.' ' An' yet I think ye've no seen the best. I ken weel every possible sicht o' the place, and I aye think the view from the ash tree, just beside the hoose up yonder, beats them a'. If ye wad na' mind walking sae far, I wad hke ye to see it frae there, before ye make up yer mind.' N"], [202, "194 DUNCAN MORAY. Isabel readily assented to the proposal, and was forthwith convoyed to the seat under the ash tree. A single glance was enough. ' Oh, this is far better than any I have seen yet,' she exclaimed. ' I thocht ye wad like it. There's nae anither place frae which ye get the shape o' the hills sae weel. But I doubt ye'll like a lower seat. Duncan '11 fetch ye one. ' Thank you very much, but I fear I must not stay to-day. I wish I had met you earlier. It is a perfect day for sketching ; but I fear it is too late to begin.' ' Its no abune twelve o'clock.' ' Yes, but the outline will take some time, it will need careful drawing, and Marion will expect me home to dinner, about one o'clock.' ' We'll be having dinner in aboot an hour,' the old man replied. ' We'll be prood if ye'll stop an' sketch, an' have some with us. It's no often ye get such a clear view as to-day.' ' You are very kind, and I only wish I could ; but I fear I must not. Poor Marion would be"], [203, "DUNCAN MORAY. 195 frightened out of her wits, thinking I had lost myself, or got into some trouble.' Adam Moray fixed a kindly but searching glance upon her. ' Are ye really in earnest that ye wad like it ? ' ' Most certainly. Why should you doubt it ? ' and the clear brown eyes looked full into his. He smiled. ' Folk make civil speeches whiles, that don't mean onything, but I doubt that's no yer way. Duncan, ye might just ride down to Beechwood, an' tell Mrs. Boswell Miss Elliott is here, an' will stay for her dinner.' ' Oh, indeed,' exclaimed Isabel, ' you must not take so much trouble. If you will give me an invitation for another day, Mr. Moray, I shall be delighted to accept it. But I cannot let Mr. Duncan Moray take so much trouble.' ' I hope ye'll never wait for an invitation, Miss Elliott, when ye're minded to come to Craignellan. Ye'll aye be a welcome an' honoured guest. But there'll be nae trouble. Duncan '11 be prood to gang. Isabel looked deprecatingly at the son. ' I hope"], [204, "196 DUNCAN MORAY. it is not really inconvenient,' she said. ' I seem doomed to give you trouble.' ' It's a sort o' trouble one can stand a great deal o',' he replied. ' I'll bring ye a chair in a moment, Miss Elliott. I'm glad ye can get the sketch in to-day, for it's just an extra clear day. Indeed it's that clear I doubt we'll have rain before the morning.' He brought a low chair, and a mat, and then went off to the stable. 'I'll leave ye, too, Miss Elliott,' the old man said. ' I ken sketchers like to be left alane. My housekeeper will come an' tell ye when the dinner is ready.' The outline of the sketch was one needing great care. Still Isabel's thoughts would wander a little, to an amused reflection on the extent of her own ignorance, mingled with thanksgiving at the remembrance that she had kept that ignorance safely locked in her own bosom, and had in no way betrayed the bacon fed rustic theory. She felt that she was treated with courteous deference, as a person belonging to a higher social circle, yet she had been bidden to join the farmhouse dinner"], [205, "DUNCAN MORAY. 197 with as much cordial friendliness as if she had been an old acquaintance. What would the entertain ment be like ? Her inbred courtesy would have enabled her to face with perfect equanimity bacon aud beans on the kitchen table, flanked by a huge bowl of smoking potatoes, and a vast jug of beer, such as some of her rural recollections brought up before her. But she felt very certain the two handsome, courteous, well-mannered men who were to be her hosts, did not dine in that fashion, and she possessed no sort of experience on which to found any other theory. She was still specu lating on the subject, when she heard the sound of horse's hoofs in the stable yard, and she smiled at the thought of how rapidly some part of Duncan Moray's ride must have been got over. She saw him cross from the stables to the house, but he did not come near her, and she remained undisturbed until Joan came to her. ' The dinner is just ready, mem,' she said, ' an' Mr. Moray thocht ye'd likely wish to wash yer hands.'"], [206, "DUNCAN MORAY. 198 ' I should certainly like to do so,' Isabel answered, ' for I have been cutting pencils.' She rose as she spoke. ' We'll carry in the things please, mem,' Joan said, ' just for fear ony o' the dogs might come aboot.' She carried in the chair and rug, and then led the way to a comfortably furnished bedroom, where hot water was waiting, with all other requisites for Miss Elliott's simple toilet. Adam Moray himself was waiting at the foot of the stahs when she came down, and conducted her to the dining room. ' We've nae drawing room for ye, Miss Elliott,' he said. ' When ye honour twa lane men wi' yer company, ye maun pit up wi' things in the rough. I hope ye got on weel wi' yer sketch.' ' Very well so far. I shall soon be able to fill in the outline.' ' An' I hope ye're hungry enough to eat a plain dinner, for here it comes. We live very simply, ye ken, in farm hooses.' ' And so you do not get the gout,' said Isabel, sententiously."], [207, "DUNCAN MORAY. 199 ' Oh yes, whiles,' he replied, laughing. ' Though I doubt we hae less o't than ye, wi' yer eicht o'clock dinners, an' nae end o' richly dressed dishes, to say naething o' the heap o' different wines.' The simple ways of farm houses, at least as ex emplified at Craignellan, appeared to Isabel much to be commended, for the plain dinner was excellently cooked and served, and she was very hungry. Joan played the part of hostess with much quiet discretion, and both father and son chatted easily and pleasantly, not always quite so intelligibly as she could have wished, giving her much information about the neighbourhood and its ways. ' Ye'll like to get back to yer sketching while the light is good, I'm thinking,' the old man said, as they rose from table. ' It changes soon, once the afternoon is fairly in.' ' Will you not stay ? ' she asked, after he arranged her chair and rug for her. ' I have done all the troublesome part. I can talk quite well now."], [208, "200 DUNCAN MORAY. 'I'll be prood to stay, if ye're sure I'll no disturb ye.' And he seated himself on the bench, and watched her at work for a brief space in silence. ' Sixty years ago ye couldn't have made that sketch,' he said at last, ' nor even fifty. Ye'd no' have seen sae muckle as a chimney pot o' the hoose frae where ye're sitting.' ' Sixty years ago,' repeated Isabel, pausing. ' Can you remember Beechwood sixty years ago ? ' ' Ay, that can I. I'm seventy past, noo. I was a laddie ten years auld sixty years ago. I mind weel what Beechwood was like then. I mind Major Charles succeeding, he was nephew to him they ca'd the wicked Colonel, an' was ca'd for him. He succeeded his uncle Robert, him that cam' next after the wicked Colonel, an' he was father to the late laird. The place was terribly overgrown an' neglected. It was a fan* smother o' trees, an' there was nae quarry. The hoose maun hae been nae better than a mouldy auld dungeon. Major Charles was gey little there, an' he did na' live mair than aboot thirteen years, an' then came the laird"], [209, "DUNCAN MORAY. 201 that's just deid. He cut a heap o' the trees, an greatly improved the place.' ' Have you lived here all your life ? ' Isabel asked, her interest in the old man greatly in tensified by the fact, thus suddenly brought vividly before her, that he had been throughout his life in close contact with the family of whom she knew so little. ' It has aye been my hame. I dinna mean that I hae never been awa frae it. My father heired the place before ever I was born.' ' Then you must surely have known my father, as a boy ? ' ' I may have seen him, but I've no mind o't. When Major Charles did come, he'd aye a heap o' folk wi' him, an' there was a deal o' coming an' going. When the late laird came in, I was awa frae hame a gude bit.' Isabel remained silent for a while. Seventy years of age. Then the man by her side had been born some twenty years after that mysterious transaction which was occupying her thoughts so much. All that he had learned, in youth and early"], [210, "202 DUNCAN MORAY. manhood, upon the subject, must have come from those who had had personal knowledge, so far as anyone had it, of all that had happened. And Duncan Moray had said his father did believe there had been some cheating about the matter. She laid down her pencil, and looked earnestly up in the old man's face. ' Mr. Moray,' she said, ' do you really believe that piece of land rightly belongs to you ? ' Adam Moray was gazing tranquilly over the landscape. He gave a httle start, and turned a quick keen glance upon her. ' What, the Rig Mains ? ' he asked. ' Wha tell't ye aught o' that ? ' ' Various people. Did your son not tell you that we had spoken about it ? ' ' No. He didn't mention it. Isabel coloured. ' Perhaps he wished nothing said to you, and I ought not to have mentioned it.'

' Your son said there had been much bitterness and heart burning about it, and that it was perhaps"], [211, "DUNCAN MORAY. 203 better left to sleep. I thought perhaps, by his not mentioning it to you, he did not wish you should be made to think about it.' ' Oh no. The business cost me many a heart ache, that's quite true; but nothing to prevent yer talking aboot it. But I canna think why ye should care for an auld story like that.' ' I cannot bear the thought that perhaps we have both your money and your land.' ' That's what ye certainly havn't got. There's naething man* than a possibility ye may have got our land. But if so, there was never a soul the better for our money save the wicked Colonel's gambling acquaintances.' ' But you really do think the land is yours by right ? ' ' No, Miss Elliott, I canna' say that. There is a possibility, that is all. There is nae doubt that Mrs. Gillespie's grandfather heard my great uncle say he'd paid for the land.

An' I've never been able to make out quite whether that story aboot his ganging to the hoose an' being robbed o' the papers cam' frae my uncle himsel', or whether it was just a tale that grew up round his asserting the Colonel had swindled him, which might have been only because he was not satisfied aboot the title deeds.' ' I wish those papers could be found,' Isabel said. ' Ye seem desperately anxious to get rid o' yer property.' ' Not at all. What I want to be rid of, is the feeling that perhaps we are holding other people's property. I wanted to look for the papers, but both Mr. Gillespie and your son think I ought not to do anything until my father comes home.' ' I am glad they gie'd ye sic gude advice. There should be nae meddling till the land comes. Maybe he'll no care to move in the matter.'

' My dear,' said the old man, ' do ye think if I had a bad opinion o' yer father, I wad ever say a word to you ? I never heard aught against him, save that he'd been wild at the college, an' his cousin was sair set against him. But I'm an auld man, and I ken when a man's been sae muckle aboot the world as yer father has, he gets to look at things very differently frae the way young people look at them. The world's a hard grind stane, and soon grinds aff the fine fresh generosity o' youth. I wadna like ye to misjudge it, if yer father doesna see the thing just as ye do.' Isabel was silent for a moment. Then she said, ' You would see it just as I do, and you are older than my father.' Moray's face saddened. Not older in contact wi' the world, I doubt. Ye see our positions hae been gey different. Besides, Miss Elliott, I'd sic a warning as I doubt yer father never had, for a grasping spirit took a sair haud on my ain father, and its aye made me pray I might be ready to gie"], [214, "206 DUNCAN MORAY. up a' I possess, rather than grow hard an' grasping. I wadna, for a' the world, Duncan should ever have the sair sad heart my puir father cost me. Never was a better son, an' it's aye been the prayer o' my life that when I'm awa there may be nae tinge o' sadness in his thochts o' me.' All unwittingly he had sent a shot of pain through his listener's heart, and her eyes filled with tears. ' Eh, Miss Elliott,' he exclaimed, laying his hand on hers, ' but I've vexed ye. Auld fule that I am. Ye think I'm just in a way boasting myself to be mair honourable than yer father.' ' No indeed,' she replied, ' I never thought of such a thing. It was the way you spoke of your son. It is so different with my father and me. He is very kind to me, and we are very good friends, but that is all. Of course it must have disappointed him very much that I was not a son, but he has never let me see that. Still I never feel as if I was of much importance to him. He is such a self-contained man. I have always felt"], [215, "DUNCAN MORAY. 207 that it would make very little difference to him if I went away altogether, and it has made my life a very lonely one. AVhat you said about your son seemed to bring it all so vividly before me.' ' The case is very different, ye see. Ours is a very different sort o' a life. A father left wi' an only son, in a farm hoose, is a different sort o' a thing from a gentleman like yer father, wi' an only daughter in London. Ye maun hae patience, Miss Elliott. Yer time'll come. Ye'll find every year, noo, as yer father grows aulder, he'll come to think mair o' ye. Duncan's been a son that's never let me feel the want o' a daughter, but its a great blessing, when a man begins to grow auld and frail, that he should hae a gude daughter to look to him. Yer father '11 soon begin to feel that, an' then ye'll hae yer reward.' Isabel Elliott was strangely moved by his words. For the first time in her life she found herself in close contact with a keenly sympathetic nature, and that contact seemed, in a measure, to reveal her to herself. Vague, dimly outlined sensations of loneliness and isolation began to take shape and"], [216, "208 DUNCAN MORAY. form, rousing a strange tumult within her. She did not reply for a few moments. Then she said : ' What a nice kind way you have of putting things.' ' Is it no just the truth ? ' 'Perhaps. But most people manage to make truth rather unpleasant than pleasant, I think. Certainly, lately, I have had one or two momentary glimpses of my father in a different character from any I have ever known before. It may be as you say. But now 1 think I have done all I can to the sketch to-day, and I had better go home. Thank you very much for being so kind to me.' 'There's nae thanks due, Miss Elliott.

' Then I'll just gang far eneuch to pit ye on the right path, and save ye climbing dykes.' He led the way through the garden, and across a field to a gate opening on to the path from which she had diverged lower down during her morning ramble. ' This will lead ye straight to the bridge,' he said, ' and mind ye come back soon.' She held his hand in hers for a moment, and looked up steadily and gravely at him. ' If that land is never yours, Mr. Moray,' she said, ' it will be your son's, some day. Sooner or later, if my life is spared, the decision must rest with me, and then the thing is settled.' The old man smiled upon her, but he shook his head. ' I'm no sae sure o' that,' he replied.' 'Ye'll no settle it quite sae easy as ye think, lassie, an' it'll nae be a contest in which lawyers '11 be able to help ye muckle. ' Ye'll find Duncan can be stiff in the temper when he chooses.'

' Ay,' he said to himself, ' some one will see, but it'll nae be me. There's nae but one way ye could ever bring that business to a satisfactory ending, an' that's oot o' all possibility, worse luck.' He turned away with a sigh, and walked slowly back towards the house. His son met him, and they sauntered across the grass, to the seat under the ash tree. Isabel was still visible in the distance, crossing the valley. ' Yon's a winsome lassie, Duncan,' his father said. ' I've no seen one this mony a day I think sae muckle o'. But how did ye no tell me she had talked to ye aboot the land ? ' ' I meant to tell ye, but one way an' anither it just slippit past. Was she telling ye aboot it ? ' ' Ay, she was.

Ye maun try and persuade her to do naething in the matter, without consulting ye first. We might, that way, keep her frae saying aught to the laird until we've time to see what he is really like.

But it is queer how things happen. Had I ken't a' ye feared, I could na hae spoken better to her than I did.' ' That was weel said,' was Duncan Moray's well satisfied rejoinder, after hearing his father's account of the ways in which he had impressed"], [220, "DUNCAN MORAY. 212 upon Isabel the improbability of a world-worn man regarding a subject with all the generous enthusiasm of a young fresh nature. ' She'll remember that if things dont go just as she wad like. What set ye on the notion o' saying such a thing to her ? ' ' The teaching o' experience, Duncan,' the old man answered, sadly. ' I could weel tell what wad hae been my ain fate if I'd tried ever to get my puir father to gie up aught he could haud a grip o'.' One part of his conversation with Isabel Elliott Adam Moray carefully concealed, and that was her parting assurance, and his rejoinder. He would not for a moment risk the chance of suggesting to his son the train of thought which had passed through his own mind. It had been a grief to him that Duncan had not married. It would be a far heavier one to know that his heart was given to a woman he could never hope to win. A glimpse into his son's mind at the moment would have been a startling revelation to him of the possible depth of our ignorance of the workings"], [221, "DUNCAN MORAY. 213 of a mind, with which we are in intimate and constant association. While he sat reflecting, half sadly, what a prize Duncan might have won, had he been in a position to aspire to Isabel Elliott's hand, Duncan himself was quietly thinking about her, not exactly with either hope or fear ; rather in a spirit of firmly fixed determination. A certainty and a conviction not openly admitted by himself were lying deep in his heart. The certainty that he did ring true, from crown to foot ; the convic tion that, as Mrs. Grierson had expressed it, Isabel Elliott was a girl who would go her own way with superb disregard for what anyone might say or think."], [222, "214 DUNCAN MORAY. CHAPTER X. IS SHE AN ORIGINAL ? TSABEL Elliott meantime had walked home \u25a0*\u25a0 occupied in a laudable attempt to reconstruct a correct representation of things out of the shattered remnants of her demolished impressions. These were Scottish farmers were they ? Duncan Moray a son-in-law at the manse ! Why one of those vapid common place manse girls was as unsuited for a wife for him, as the bacon fed rustic of her earlier experiences would have been for the husband of an English rector's daughter. The social conditions in the case of the manse and Craignellan were suitable enough, it was a question of natural refinement, and lofty tone of moral sentiment, against inate vulgarity of character. Although she had fallen in love with her new home at first sight, she had not fallen equally readily in love with the untitled aristocracy, or"], [223, "DUNCAN MORAY. 215 the plutocracy of her country; but now she had discovered that it possessed a class of inhabitants wholly new and extremely attractive to her, a study of whom promised to deepen and widen the interest she already felt in the land to which by lineage, though not by birth, she belonged. With the tendency to rash generalization from which youth is never wholly free, she concluded that the Morays were as thoroughly representative of Scottish farmers, as she had hitherto supposed her rustic clown to be of English farmers. But adorable or not, the plutocracy had at least been cordial and good natured, and it behoved her to manifest her appreciation of the fact. So a few days after her sketching expedition she wrote a note to Mrs. Millar, offering a visit of a few days, if it was convenient for the South end carriage to call for her. The arrival of this note raised quite a little turmoil in the Millar household. More than one side issue constituted her acceptance of the invitation a sort of diplo matic triumph. Try as they may, those whose social enfranchisement is a thing of yesterday, can never"], [224, "DUNCAN MORAY. 216 be quite the same as those whose position to-day is just what it has been for centuries. You may build a young ruin, and make it an exact facsimile of an old ruin, but you will never succeed in making it look quite the same as an old ruin. Try as she might, Mrs. Millar had never been able to feel that she looked Mrs. Millar of Southend, exactly as Mrs. Grierson looked Mrs. Grierson of the Rowans ; and nothing produced in her a stronger or more morti fying conviction that there was something in it which was not to be learned, than her instant per ception that Isabel Elliott, a girl bom and brought up in London, without either wealth or position, was, in the first moments of her translation, with out effort, without even consciousness, all that she herself had for some years been steadily and vainly striving to be. ' It must be in the blood,' she said impatiently to herself. If it was in the blood, it must then be a heritable quality. If she could succeed in carrying out her schemes, she might yet live to see the ambition, disappointed as far as her own personal success went, gratified in her descen dants. Her son would be one degree less a"], [225, "DUNCAN MORAY. 217 mushroom than herself. If his children should inherit from their mother the properties of primeval timber, the process of development might be greatly accelerated, to say nothing of the chance that from the mere force of constant association, Walter himself might acquire a certain amount of superficially primeval appearance. These day dreams naturally occupied the fore most place in Mrs. Millar's thoughts. But there were other more certain, if less important, sources of pleasurable anticipation connected with the visit. The moment was auspicious, for almost all the primeval timber was at home, and it rarely declined the attractions of the lawn tennis parties at Southend. A specially alluring one could easily be arranged, and Mrs. Millar would enjoy the social triumph of introducing to the county the new representative of its oldest family. Mrs. Alison would be amazed, Mrs. Grierson would be morti fied, and Lady Sinclair would give vent to loud voiced wonderment.

Isabel Elliott prepared for her visit without the slightest suspicion of the complex motives which underlay the superficial aspect of things. That Mrs. Millar might be, to some extent, incited to hospitality through self interest she did believe ; though not even Mrs. Grierson's warnings and counsels had brought home to her a sufficiently vivid consciousness of her own importance to suggest that she might be the object of such ela borate scheming. But fate was in a pranksome mood, and decreed that that very same alarm regarding Miss Elliott's orthodoxy on the subject of the traditions of society, which the Southend tactics had been the means of arousing in Mrs. Grierson's breast, should be aroused in Mrs. Millar's own breast, even before the accomplishment of her social triumph, and probably in a far more acute form ; for the sensitiveness of the mushroom"], [227, "DUNCAN MORAY. 219 to social distinctions far transcends that of primeval timber. It was that audacious individual, Duncan Moray, who set all Mrs. Millar's nerves quivering with indignant protest. Some dull grey days had prevented Isabel from continuing her sketch, and just as the weather seemed inclined to improve, Adam Moray meditated being away for the whole day. ' Ye might just ride round by Beechwood, Duncan,' he said, ' an' tell her I'll no be at hame to-morrow. I wad na like for her to come when ye are here alane. There's nae end to people's clash.' In obedience to this behest, Duncan Moray rode up to the house at Beechwood, a few moments after Isabel had come down stairs ready for her drive, to await the impending arrival of the Millars. Under the impression that the ring announcedtheir advent, Mrs. Boswell appeared at the door with Peter in attendance, to put Miss Elliott's dress-box into the carriage."], [228, "220 DUNCAN MORAY. 'Would ye please tell Miss Elliott, from my father,' he began. But Marion cut him short. ' Just come awa in, an' gie her the message yersel, man.' ' I think I'd better no do that,' replied Duncan. ' Duncan Moray,' retorted Mrs. Boswell, in fierce wrath, ' think ye me and mine hae livet a hundred years wi' the Elliotts, nae to ken by noo wha we sud or sud na ask into Beechwood House ?

When I ask ye to come into the hoose, an' ye find ye're no welcome, just tell me o't' Thus adjured, Duncan Moray dismounted, and was conducted to the drawing-room, where Isabel, at the moment, was standing by the table, turning over some books, and looking remarkably hand some in her rich but simple afternoon dress, which she wore with such unconscious ease that Marion declared she looked ' like as she had been born in it.' Duncan contemplated her with profound admiration, unstreaked by any mortifying self conscious comparisons. She was, to him, simply the woman whom he had placed upon the vacant"], [229, "DUNCAN MORAY. 221 throne in his breast, and in her presence loyal adoration allowed no room for any thoughts of self. And in truth, though he might lack some thing of her superficial advantages, in his simple manliness, and unassuming dignity of quiet self respect, he could well bear contrasting with her. The man who profoundly worships a noble type of womanhood, and would sacrifice for her everything he possesses in the world, rarely shows to dis advantage in her presence. ' It is very kind of Mr. Moray to send me word,' she said, on receiving the message. 'I should have been very sorry to miss seeing him. But I am going to Southend for a few days. I am expect ing Mrs. Millar directly to drive me over. I shall come aud finish the sketch when I return. Have you never been in this room before ? ' she added, seeing that his eyes were wandering about inquiringly. ' I was never inside the house. The auld laird would as soon have let a mad dog into his house as a Moray. He'd veiy different notions from yours. He held us for no better than swindlers,"], [230, "222 DUNCAN MORAY. for he aye held to it that it was a plain blunder in the deed o' entail, that the wicked Colonel had ta'en advantage of to sell Craignellan. I believe he aye thought, if there was any truth in the stories about the cheating, that it was naething but a just judgment on us.' ' Just, I should imagine, what he would think,' Isabel replied. ' But come this way for a moment,' \u2014 and she led the way to the dining room. ' Do you know who that is,' she asked, pausing before a picture of a young man in the stiff military dress of the middle of the eighteenth century. ' I know who it must be,' he replied, ' from what Gillespie said, for it's just yerseP in man's dress. It's the wicked Colonel.' Isabel laughed. ' You are as cruelly candid as my father and Mr. Gillespie,' she said. ' Have you no dread of my indignation ? ' ' I'd rather face yer indignation than yer con tempt, Miss Elliott.

Ye're very like what the Colouel must have been when that portrait was taken, but I can't think it would have been the same in later life. An' now I'll be going. My horse is no extra good at standing.' As they came out of the dining room together, a pang of jealous alarm shot through the breast of Mrs. Millar, who, accompanied by a daughter, had just entered the hall. Who was this stalwart stranger, visiting Miss Elliott in her father's absence ? She greeted Isabel with effusive cordi ality, eyeing her companion, the while, with such evident curiosity, that Isabel construed the look as a hint."], [232, "DUNCAN MORAY. 224 ' I think,' she said gravely, ' you do not know Mr. Duncan Moray.' The name brought no enlightenment to Mrs. Millar. Southend being situated in another parish, heritors' and other meetings did not bring the Millars and Moray into contact. She had heard of Craignellan and his son, but of Morays she knew nothing. ' I think I have not had the pleasure,' she murmured in a hesitating manner, uncertain whether the circumstances demanded dignity, friendliness, or condescension. Duncan Moray, with a slightly sardonic smile, saluted her in silence, and then wished Isabel good afternoon. She held out her hand cordially. ' Give my love to your father,' she said, ' and tell him I should have been heart-broken had I missed him. Will you come to the drawing-room, Mrs. Millar. I have only to put my hat on. I shall not detain you a moment.' ' But, my dear Miss Elliott,' Mrs. Millar asked, ' who was that ? It seemed to me that you thought I should know the name. I don't remember \u2014 '"], [233, "DUNCAN MORAY. 225 ' Mr. Duncan Moray is the son of old Mr. Moray of Craignellan.' ' Oh ! ' The monosyllable was almost a gasp, but it was all which, at the moment, Mrs. Millar was capable of uttering. A whole magazine of combustible facts ; Duncan Moray's presence ; Miss Elliott's manner; the message to his father; the possibility of Miss Elliott being an original ; the certainty that Walter disliked originality ; all exploded simultaneously within her, with disturb ing force, sufficient to have shaken severely the mental structure of a far less conventionally correct person. Before she had time to recover her presence of mind, Isabel, greatly amused, was half way upstairs. ' My dear Helen ! ' ejaculated Mrs. Millar. ' Well ? ' was the laconic reply. 'What can she be thinking of? Can she possibly know who and what they are ? Such a message to send ! Where can she have made their acquaintance? ' ' I have said all along that she is very proud. That is just the way with very proud people. p"], [234, "226 DUNCAN MORAY. They always make a point of being very gracious to people distinctly beneath them in position, who readily acknowledge their superior rank. Some day that, unfortunate man will go a little too far ; and then \u2014 luckless wretch ! ' ' I don't know,' Mrs. Millar replied, somewhat ruefully. ' That hardly strikes me to be her chai*acter. I feel more inclined to fear she may have taken up communistic notions. Playing at universal brotherhood is rather a fashionable craze just now. But perhaps she has been misled through their not being tenant farmers. I must try and put her on her guard. If you are quite ready, dear Miss Elliott,' she continued to Isabel, who entered the room at the moment, ' I think we had better go. The weather looks a little un certain, and we are in the open carriage.' Mrs. Millar had no intention of plunging at once into the task of enlightenment ; but accident offered her a favourable opportunity. As they drove down the valley, they overtook Duncan Moray, riding leisurely along the road side. He slightly raised his hat as the carriage passed, but without looking"], [235, "DUNCAN MORAY. 227 towards it. Miss Millar, facing him as they passed, bestowed on him a cool stare. ' That piece of civility was for you, Miss Elliott,' she said. ' We are not thus honoured.' ' Indeed ! ' replied Isabel, with an air of innocent surprise. 'How is that? Surely a century of laud ownership does not entitle the Morays to hold themselves above you.' Miss Millar was momentarily speechless. Ere she had time to rally, Mrs. Millar, who had been too much absorbed with her own designs to take in what had passed, interposed, a little nervously. ' He is a fine looking man, and rides very well. But I was a little surprised to meet him at Beech wood to-day. I is it not a little forward of him to call on you, Miss Elliott ? ' ' He did not call voluntarily ; he was sent with a message ? ' 'Oh yes, of course. So I gathered. Still, I mean his coming in, in that way. Just as an equal might have done. One has to keep one's place, you know. I suppose you know who they are?'"], [236, "228 DUNCAN MORAY. ' The Morays of Craignellan,' replied Isabel, with praiseworthy gravity. ' Yes, certainly, in a sense. Still, you know, they really belong to the tenant farmer class.' ' They have been landed proprietors for several generations.' ' Oh, of course, in a way. But it is land owner ship of a very different sort from that of the Elliotts of Beechwood, for instance.' ' Unhappily, yes. The Morays are, fortunately for them, absolutely certain that all their land is honestly then* own. We are in a less enviable position.' ' My dear Miss Elliott ! That absurd old story ! You must not allow yourself to take any such view of it. I assure you the best judges are all of opinion the whole thing was a plot to extort, money, on the part of the old miser who bought Craignellan. I heard the question discussed at a large dinner party, lately. All the best people in the county were there ; and the opinion was universal that it would be simply ridiculous for Mr. Elliott to listen to any suggestions of raising"], [237, "DUNCAN MORAY. 229 the point again. If the Morays have been attack ing you on the subject, it is simply disgraceful.' ' Their attitude towards me has been one of defence, not of attack,' replied Isabel, ' and I am sure we are greatly indebted to the county for constituting itself a court of honour on our account. I fear, however, it may be just possible neither my father nor Mr. Moray may hold them selves irrevocably bound by its decisions.' Mrs. Millar was silent, struck dumb with dismay. Miss Elliott was clearly sarcastic. If there was one thing of which Walter had a horror, it was a sarcastic woman. When she spoke again it was on indifferent topics. Never again would she proffer advice to Isabel Elliott."], [238, "230 DUNCAN MORAY. CHAPTER XL THE COST OF SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT. T)Y the following morning, however, Mrs. Millar had recovered her equanimity, and her guest was again a dear delightful girl, though perhaps with a reservation which had not existed before. The sententious remarks to which irritation or annoyance prompted Isabel Elliott not unfre quently cost her after self upbraiding, when she candidly admitted to herself that she had found offence where none was intended, merely because some personal sentiment of her own had been rudely jostled. On the present occasion she pleaded guilty before herself of having been slightly wanting in courtesy to people who had been friendly and hospitable. Moreover, laughter is a deathblow to irritation, and to laugh she was fain when she thought of the comicality of this bye play. Mrs. Grierson, terror-stricken lest she"], [239, "DUNCAN MORAY. 231 should fall a prey to the wiles of the Millars, and Mrs. Millar agonizing to rescue her from the fangs of the Morays. Under the influence of contrition and amusement she strove to make herself as agreeable as possible, and succeeded in creating a very favourable impression. Fortune in all respects seemed disposed to favour Mrs. Millar. The weather was lovely, and the lawn tennis party, arranged for the day following Miss Elliott's arrival, promised to be a great success. The lawn tennis courts at South end had been laid out, and were kept up, in a style possible only where expense is a matter of no importance. Lawn tennis parties at Southend found, therefore, favour with the greater gods of the local Olympus, and if occasionally a detach ment of them did burst upon the scene by pre concerted arrangement, take possession of every thing with some trace of patrician insolence, and give to the master and mistress of the house a little the appearance of the heads of a well patronized estabhshment, the position was at"], [240, "232 DUNCAN MORAY. least accepted by them with much apparent contentment. ' It is so fortunate,' Mrs. Millar said, at breakfast, ' that the weather promises so well. We shall have a delightful party. Lady Sinclair is coming. She has a number of people at the Castle, and she could hardly have come had it not been very fine. It is such a long drive. Do you know Lady Sinclair, Miss Elliott ? ' ' No, I have not seen her. ' She is quite charming in her way, rather blunt, but such a straightforward woman, and she is wonderfully clever. Heathfield Castle is quite the leading place in the county. I shall be glad to introduce you. I specially wanted her to come that I might do so. She is a long way from you though ; Heathfield is quite twelve miles from here. It must be close on eighteen miles from Beechwood. I wonder who she will bring with her ? ' ' Not the whole tribe she has at the Castle, I hope,' said Walter Millar. ' If she does, we shall have nothing to do but stand round the courts in"], [241, "DUNCAN MORAY. 233 a humble circle, watch the play, and run for the balls.' ' Nonsense,' exclaimed his mother, sharply, and colouring a little, 'Mrs Alison is coming also. She has called on you, I think, has she not, Miss Elliott?' ' Yes. But I did not see her. I was not at home.' ' She is nice enough, though I cannot say I care very much about her, and they are very little at Glen, which is also some distance from you. Of course you will not be getting a carriage until Mr. Elliott comes. We might drive over there one afternoon, while you are here.' ' Thank you,' was all Isabel's reply, and Mrs. Millar rattled on.' 'You will forgive us, dear Miss Elliott, if we leave Walter to amuse you this morning? I have some arrangements to attend to, and the girls must see to the flowers; the gardeners have so little taste. Walter, it would be lovely on the lake. You might take Miss Elliott for a row.' 'I shall be only too delighted if she will go. Can you steer, Miss Elliott? '"], [242, "234 DUNCAN MORAY. ' Oh, yes. I can both steer and row.' ' That is good. I can take you to a spot from whence there is a lovely view. I think we had better set out at once, if you do not mind. We shall reach the place just about the time the light is best.' Isabel was soon equipped, and found Walter Millar awaiting her in the hall. ' We will go this way, please,' he said, as they left the house. ' I want just to look through the courts, and see that everything is in order.' ' What splendid courts you have ! ' Isabel ex claimed as they came in sight of them. ' Yes,' he answered drily. ' We take good care of that. They are part of our stock in trade. It is a rule in trade, you know, that the quality of your goods must be regulated by the class of cus tomers you wish to attract.' ' What do you mean ? ' she asked. He only laughed \u2014 a laugh which had a half contemptuous ring in it. Will you take a racquet for half an hour ? ' he asked. ' Just to get your eye and hand in.'"], [243, "DUNCAN MORAY. 235 ' I do not play.' ' Not ? How wonderful ! What on earth will you do this afternoon ? ' ' Look on \u2014 and see most of the game.' ' You will see quite enough. But things seem all right ; so, as you do not care for a little pre liminary practice, we will take this path, please. It leads to the boat-house.' They were soon afloat, and Walter Millar pulled leisurely up the lake, now and again pausing to point out some object of interest to his companion, or to give her some direction about steering. At last, when they were about a mile from home, he shipped his oars. ' Now turn and look back, Miss Elliott,' he said. Isabel obeyed\u2014' Oh, how beautiful,' she ex claimed. ' Yes,' he replied, ' it is a splendid view. I often row myself up here to look at it. I believe I admire it chiefly because it is not a part of our stock in trade. It was there before we were thought of, and will be there long after we are forgotten.'"], [244, "236 DUNCAN MORAY. ' What do you mean about your stock in trade? ' Isabel asked, looking round at him. 'Wait,' he answered. 'You will understand after to-day.' Isabel was silent. She had a dim suspicion in what direction the meaning of his words lay, but was too cautious to risk a blunder by answering rashly. In a few moments he spoke again. ' By to-morrow you will understand better what I said to you at Mrs. Townley's ball. I do not in the least mind being a mushroom, but I do object to being eaten, and more especially to being eaten without venturing to resent it. I often wish we had never left the beautiful house and garden we had just outside Glasgow, when I was a boy.' ' But why in the world should you not resent being eaten if you do not like it? ' He coloured slightly, but answered at once. ' Because I cannot resent what my father and mother encourage. That is the skeleton in my cupboard, Miss Elliott. I cannot be blind to the fact that both have become tainted with the malady of being a little ashamed of their origin,"], [245, "DUNCAN MORAY. 237 and have grown into the habit of descending to unworthy means to push their way into a circle which looks down upon them. My father is a man highly respected in business circles, and my mother is one of the kindest hearted women alive. It is pain and grief to me to see them lowering themselves for a worthless end. These reception days are slow torture to both Laura and me. By to-night, you will not wonder. But I am sure there is nothing worldly about you. I hope you will not allow yourself to judge harshly of my father and mother for their little foibles. 'Accept their hospitality, and then make ill natured comments ! Is that what you expect of me, Mr. Millar ? ' ' No, indeed. But I am sure you have pene tration enough to detect what is true, and I fear your scorn being ai*oused by your believing it the whole truth.' ' You are obscure.' ' I mean that their attitude towards yourself is not absolutely genuine. To introduce Miss Elliott of Beechwood to the county magnates is a sort of"], [246, "238 DUNCAN MORAY. social triumph. Try to believe when you are forced to see the truth, that it is only a part of the truth ; and that you would have had a cordial welcome, even as a wholly unimportant person.' ' I do not think I should have made a mistake ; but I thank you most heartily for your candour.' 'I knew you would understand. The whole condition of things is distressing to me. I know my father indulges in day dreams about my future position in the county. The money he has honestly made is to buy me some penniless damsel of high degree, in whose right I am to become a county magnate. Whereas I shall sell the place, aud cut the whole thing.' ' That would be very weak minded. You have a lovely place, and every thing that can make life enjoyable. Why should you allow the absurd narrow mindedness of a self-satisfied clique to mar your happiness? Hold your own, and treat all that nonsense with the contempt it deserves.' He shook his head. ' I wish I could, but I am not strong \u2014 that way. We are a house divided against itself. My sister Laura feels in all things"], [247, "DUNCAN MORAY. 239 with me, but Helen is very ambitious, and rather urges my father and mother on, and she is far the strongest character among us. Neither Laura nor I can hold our own, as some people can. I believe if I stayed on here I should get tainted with the same malady. I think that sort of thing grows on people.' Isabel looked at him with more interest than he had yet excited in her. It was a pleasant, open, honest face, but it was not a strong one. Involun tarily it occurred to her that did his family succeed in marrying him to some needy offshoot of an old family, he would drift through life a mere appen dage to his wife. ' Surely not on those who dread the danger, she said. ' I don't know. I think it does ; at least on those who don't possess very strong characters. But I think it is about time we returned home. Keep her straight for the boathouse, please. There is rather a nasty current near here. I am so glad I have had an opportunity of beseeching you to be"], [248, "240 DUNCAN MORAY. lenient in your judgment, It will make the after noon less intolerable to me.' ' Why should you care about my judgment? It is all very well to belong to an old family, but unless one is rich as well, it does not give one much importance. And at anyrate my connection with the county cannot last for very many years.' ' I care for your judgment, because I value your good opinion. I don't know how it is that one divines these things, but from the first moment of our acquaintance, I felt that you would prize and admire all that is genuine and noble, and despise all that is mean and false ; therefore I wanted you to know the truth. I do not care the least about the opinion of all the other people, because I hold them even more contemptible than \u2014 -than we are.' Walter Millar had certainly most thoroughly carried out his mother's wishes. He had excited Isabel Elliott's interest, and raised himself in her opinion. Whether Mrs. Millar might have approved of the means by which he had obtained these advantages is another question. She was quite radiant at luncheon. For the moment, at least, the"], [249, "DUNCAN MORAY. 241 perversity of things in general seemed for her to be wholly suspended. When, later in the afternoon, Isabel Elliott descended the stairs, to take part in the great pageant of the day, with a feeling almost of reluctance, born of sympathy with the sentiments of Walter aud Laura Millar, a murmur of voices from the drawing-room told her that the county world had begun to assemble. Just as she reached the hall, a sudden bustle and stir at the entrance announced a fresh arrival. She slipped through the dining-room, out to the lawn, where, from her window, she had seen Laura and Walter standing with some other young people, and was chatting with a tall slim girl, whom, with a certain sententiousness which was natural to her, she pro nounced to herself to be a very decided mushroom, when Helen Millar came towards them. ' Will you not come to the drawing-room, Miss Elliott? ' she said. ' Mrs. Chariton is most anxious to be introduced.' Isabel obeyed the summons ; but at the moment she entered the room through the window, Mrs. Q"], [250, "DUNCAN MORA Y. 242 Grierson came sweeping in at the door, her manner unquestionably tinged with haughty langour. She had barely returned, with an absent pre-occupied air, Mrs. Millar's effusively cordial welcome, when her eye fell upon Miss Elliott. Instantly her bear ing altered, and almost turning her back upon her hostess, she held out her hand with frank cordiality. ' You incorrigible person,' she said. ' Are you quite deaf to the voice of the charmer ? ' ' Quite, when occasion serves.' ' How did you come ? ' ' In Mrs. Millar's carriage, yesterday.' ' How can you be so obstinate ? ' she asked, under her breath, as Mrs. Millar interposed. ' So kind of Miss Elliott, is it not, to spare us a few days? Of course she has no carriage yet. She will be able to return your visit while she is with us.' ' Oh, nonsense, my dear. You must not think of such a thing,' Mrs. Grierson said, accepting the information, and ignoring the giver? ' How long are you going to stay. You must come to the"], [251, "DUNCAN MORAY. 243 Rowans. Send me word, and I will send the carriage for you.' Before Isabel had time to reply, there was a great stir in the doorway. Mrs. Millar, with a hasty\u2014' Oh please come, Miss Elliott ' \u2014 hurried forward to greet with an increase of deferential cordiality a stout, fine looking, middle aged woman, whose demeanour, Isabel thought, was somewhat insolently careless. ' How do,' she said, giving her hostess the tips of some rather fat fingers. 'Charming day you have, havn't you ? Brought you quite a party, you see. First rate players some of them, and longing to try the far famed Southend courts. You must get them to work soon. I can't stay very late to-day.' At the first sound of the voice, Mrs. Grierson had glanced hastily over her shoulder, and ere Isabel had time to obey Mrs. Millar's summons, she caught her hand, and drew it through her arm. ' Come with me,' she said, as she advanced to meet the new comer. ' How are you, dear? ' she said. ' What excellent"], [252, "244 DUNCAN MORAY. time you are in. I did not expect you for another hour. What a hot drive you must have had. I want to introduce our new neighbour, Miss Elliott \u2014 Beechwood, you know. Lady Sinclair, Miss Elliott.' ' Dear. Is that Miss Elliott ? I had no idea she was coming with you. Delighted to make your acquaintance, Miss Elliott. I heard a rumour you had arrived. Is Mr. Elliott here ? ' Isabel Elliott did not very readily change colour, but there was a flash in her eye, as she replied. ' My father is in Vienna at present. I did not come with Mrs. Grierson. I am staying for a few days with Mrs. Millar.' The two dames exchanged hasty glances. ' Only a mistake,' murmured Mrs. Grierson. Then aloud, she added, ' And is coming to stay with me when she leaves here, so we shall see you.' ' Oh yes. You must come and stay at Heath field for a day or two, and bring Miss Elliott. The Duke's people are coming to dinner, one day next week ; I will let you know. Morning visits are out of the question between you and me, Miss"], [253, "DUNCAN MORAY. 245 Elliott. We are fully eighteen miles apart. I am quite charmed to have met you, and secured a chance of thus improving our acquaintance.' Isabel Elliott glanced at Mrs. Millar, smiling blandly under this absolute supersession, and grasped for the moment, with exceeding vivid ness, the degrading influences of an eager desire to gain an upward step in the social scale. Then she answered, with cold courtesy of tone, 'You are very kind, Lady Sinclair, but Mrs. Grierson's too cordial hospitality is leading her astray. The date of my father's return is so absolutely uncertain, that it is not possible for me to be absent from home for many days. I hope to avail myself of Mrs. Millar's kind offer of the use of her carriage to call at The Rowans while I am here. But when I leave, I must return home at once.' As she spoke Lady Sinclair gave her a keen penetrating glance, out of a pair of very fine clear honest gray eyes. At the moment Walter Millar came up."], [254, "DUNCAN MORAY. 246 \u2022 We are going to begin playing, Miss Elliott,' he said. ' Will you come and look on ? ' ' Oh, my dear Walter,' broke in his mother, you must arrange a game at once for Lady Sinclair's party. Where are Helen and Laura. Miss Elliott will excuse you, I am sure. Mr. Charlton, you are not going to play just yet? Please take Miss Elliott to the courts.' ' Do you not play, Miss Elliott ? ' asked Mrs. Grierson. 'No? Then you are dismissed, Mr. Charlton. Miss Elliott will go with me. I want to talk to her.' Walter Millar had flushed crimson as his mother spoke, but had turned to Lady Sinclair with a coldly courteous manner, which lifted him many degrees in Isabel's estimation. He moved away with her and her following. Mrs. Millar turned to receive a fresh arrival of guests, and Mrs. Grierson and Isabel passed out to the lawn. ' You are the most impracticable girl I ever came across,' she said. ' I plead guilty.'"], [255, "DUNCAN MORAY. 247 ' I believe you wish to renew the old feud between the Griersons and Elliotts.' 'I? How in the world have I manifested any such wish ? ' ' By putting every possible slight you can upon me. I ask you to The Rowans, and you will not come ; and yet you can find time to rush into the arms of these Glasgow shopkeepers. Were I not the most long suffering of mortals, I should leave you to the fate you deserve.' ' You know your accusations are unjust. Had you asked me to The Rowans first, I should have come to you and refused the Millars.

' My dear, logic has no place in social tactics.' ' I do not understand social tactics, and have no desire to practice them.' 'No. You are determined to be a law unto yourself. But you are making a mistake. You"], [256, "248 DUNCAN MORAY. are somewhat new to your position, and should really be guided by those who have more experi ence. I am sure, if your father had been here, he would never have allowed you to commit yourself in this way.' ' In what way ? ' ' By mixing yourself up with these Millars. You know the good houses are always a little shy of new comers, even those belonging to old families, when they have known nothing of them personally. It is most ill judged of you to run the chance of it being said you are thick with the Millar set. It was most fortunate that I arrived just in time to prevent her getting the chance of introducing you to Lady Sinclair. Heathfield Castle is the first house in the county, and you have managed to make a good impression. It is not every one, I can tell you, who gets an invitation to meet the Duke's people there. You must reconsider your determination, aud go there with me next week.' ' Quite impossible. I am much honoured by Lady Sinclair's approval, but I do not in the least care about meeting the Duke's people, and I cannot"], [257, "DUNCAN MORAY. 249 go to Heathfield. I might at any moment receive a telegram to say my father would be at Beech wood within a few hours.' ' And only too glad your father would be, I am certain, to arrive and find you were at Heathfield. However, his absence will cover your mistake. But you must mind what you are about. Your independent ways will not do. If Lady Sinclair once got the notion that you had refused her in vitation from indifference, aud you mix yourselves up with the Millars, good bye to your chances of being made free of Heathfield.' ' I have no intention of mixing myself up with the Millars. Mrs. Millar is very good natured and hospitable, but she is not a person with whom I should ever care to be intimate. I choose however to be on friendly terms with hospitable neighbours, and shall most certainly not consult Lady Sinclair as to what I should or should not do. Unless she improves very much on acquaintance, I shall be able to endure exclusion from Heathfield with much fortitude.' ' She does not improve,' replied Mrs. Grierson"], [258, "DUNCAN MORAY. 250 with enchanting frankness. ' I am convinced she must have begun life as a horsebreaker. She cer tainly used to be a magnificent rider. No one quite knows who she was, and there are some queer stories. I believe she did elope once, but Sir Robert let her come back, and it was all hushed up. She is wonderfully clevei*, and they are immensely rich. She has made herself quite the woman of the county. They make a great deal of her at the Duke's. She is a capital election eering agent.' ' What a delightful account. How would it be possible to endure life if one was not on Lady Sinclair's visiting list.' ' Don't be sarcastic, my dear. Nothing makes a girl more unpopular. And do not recklessly cast away your chances. It is all very well to put on superb airs, when you have just received a most flattering mark of attention, but you will find it a very different thing if you do succeed in closing the doors of Heathfield against you. Then you will be ready to cry your eyes out with vexation that you did not listen to my remonstrances.'"], [259, "DUNCAN MORAY. 251 'Time will show. But whether I listen or not, Mrs. Grierson, I shall always gratefully remember the kind interest you have shown in me.' ' You are a strange girl, but you are much too headstrong for your age. Now I must go in, I feel it a little chilly.' She turned back towards the house, and Isabel sauntered on to join the spectators round the tennis courts. She stayed and watched the play for a time, making such mental notes in connec tion with her morning's conversation, as the interruption of frequent introductions rendered possible. An hour later Lady Sinclair was taking leave of her with a good deal more than her usual urbanity. ' Good-bye, my dear Miss Elliott. I am so sorry you think you cannot come to us next week. But I shall still cherish a hope my dear good friend Mrs. Grierson may induce you to change your mind.' 'You are very kind,' Isabel replied, with her stateliest manner, ' but I know it will be quite impossible.'"], [260, "DUNCAN MORAY. 252 ' We shall see. Mrs. Grierson, my dear, I depend on your influence. Good-bye!' and she disappeared. ' What does it all mean ? ' Mrs. Alison asked, as Isabel walked away. 'Mean? Why that she has all the pride and all the independence of all the border chiefs of two centuries combined. I am greatly taken with her myself. She has so much more strength than she has the least idea of. She floors one with the most sententious answers, and fancies she has made the most common-place replies imaginable. But I fear she will land herself in utter isolation.' ' I don't know. It looks to me more like cool and daring policy. That parting was superb. She might have been an Empress taking leave of a barely tolerated subject. A girl who can treat Lady Sinclair in that way, and coolly decline to meet the Duke's people at Heathfield, must, I should say, be playing a daring game.' ' Not a bit of it. She has not a grain of worldliness in her composition. It is indifference pure and simple. She has her own ideas, and she"], [261, "DUNCAN MORAY. 253 means to go her own way. If they were rich it might answer ; but the property is worth very little. Lady Sinclair is bound to win in the end. And you may depend, after such a snub, she will not spare her.' In the course of another hour all the guests had departed, and Isabel Elliott, dressed for dinner, was standing at the draAving-room window, watch ing the gorgeous hues of a splendid suuset, reflect ing themselves back from the smooth surface of the lake. She was shortly joined by Walter Millar. 'Now you understand,' he said. She turned her eyes upon him with a grave, thoughtful look ; but she only answered, ' I am very sorry tor you, it must be very bitter.' ' Unutterably bitter.' ' Still you must remember affection quickens our perception of weaknesses, as well as of virtues. Things which you feel keenly will be hardly noticed by indifferent spectators.' ' Not this afternoon, certainly,' he replied, with a smile. ' Everyone was too much occupied in"], [262, "254 DUNCAN MORAY. observing a girl Avho treated Lady Sinclair with lofty indifference, and steadily declined to go to Heathfield, to have much attention to spare for anything else. You are credited with being a magnificent tactician, Miss Elliott.' ' Another instance of the magnificence of human capacity for blundering,' she answered. And then Mrs. Millar's entrance put a stop to the conversa tion."], [263, "DUNCAN MORAY. 255 CHAPTER XII. AN OLD SORROW WAKES AND CRIES. T\\UNCAN MORAY'S quick insight into his father's moods, enabled him to detect instantly, on the old man's return from his previously men tioned expedition, that something had occurred which had greatly disturbed his serenity. He was evidently tired, but he was something more than tired. He was depressed, and seemed disposed to be silent and absent. Like a wise man, Duncan said nothing until those quiet unobtrusive attentions which he knew so Avell how to offer, and a good tea, had both refreshed and cheered his father. Then, as they sat together under the Aveeping ash, in the soft evening light, he asked \u2014 ' What's gane wrang avP ye the day, father? ' Adam Moray did not instantly reply. He took"], [264, "DUNCAN MORAY. 256 his pipe from between his lips, slowly blew out a cloud of smoke, and then said, ' I doubt ye'll no be muckle the wiser if I tell ye. I met James Carfrae.' Duncan shook his head. ' I ken naught o' him,' he said. ' I doubt if ye ever heard his name. My know ledge of him was a short an' a bitter one, but it was before ye were born. He's no ane I have ever cared to speak about. But since IVe chanced upon him, ye'se best hear the whole story, for if the suspicions that have come into my mind be onywhere near the truth, I doubt the land '11 no be lang here till Carfrae's after him. An' then there'll be trouble.' ' Ye're tired the nicht, father ; put it off till to morrow.' ' No, I think I'll sleep the better noo for telling ye, after having it a' rakit up in my thochts again. I was innocent eneuch in the business, God knows, and yet I was the cause o' the death o' as fine a lad as ever lived. It Avas when I was out in Australia. For a year or twa before I cam' hame,"], [265, "DUNCAN MORAY. 257 I'd been in a wild part o' the country an' among a rough lot. I've nae mind exactly as to Avhen Carfrae came. There was aye a lot o' coming an' going among us, but I mind we wondered Avhiles about him. He'd a way wi' him made us doubt he'd been in a better position. He was free eneuch about himsel', never seemed as he'd onything to hide. He said his father was an auld retainer in a gude family, an' that he'd had a gude education, an' was meant for business. But he couldna' thole an office stool, sae just went off as servant to one o' the young gentlemen that had died, an' so he'd come out to the Colonies for love o' a Avandering life. I never likit him. He was too fond o' the dice for me, and aye lucky. I've doubted mony a time if it was all fair fortune. ' Weel, there were a gude few o' us had made a little money. No vera muckle, but mair than we cared to keep, avP queer characters aboot, for a man's life was o' little account out there in those days, an' we were on the watch for a chance to send it to the nearest place where there was a bank.

' He was to start early, and Avalk a matter o' a mile or so, to a house where he wad get his horse, an' join his party. We'd kept it close eneuch about the money, an' the evening before Henderson was to start, Carfrae cam' to me an' said he'd just heard Henderson Avas taking money for us, was it true, an' was Henderson a safe man, as he'd like weel to get him to take some for him, if he was, but he scarce knew him. I said he could trust Henderson like his ain blither. Then he said he had to be aff himsel' before the break o' day; should I see Henderson, an' wad I gie him the cash for him, as he Avadna' be back for a day or twa.

I'd gane about a mile, when I heard before me a shot an' a sudden cry. The bush was thick there, an' there was a bit turn in the path, sae I couldna see far ahead.

Just round the bend, nae mair than fifty yards before me, I saw puir Henderson lying on the ground, an' that scoundrel Carfrae rifling his pockets. I gied a shout, an' covered him wi' my pistol, but he sprang into the bush an' disappeared. I doubt he'd no hae gane sae quick had he kent I was alane, but I expect he thocht ithers were behind.

I set out a few days after, before the search party cam' hame, an' frae that day till yesterday, I never heard or saw ought mair o' the matter.

I got through my work quicker than I thought to do, an' found if I walked ower to Glentrae I could catch an earlier train hame. I got to Glentrae a gude bit before the train started, sae I went into the hotel to rest a bit. Of course there's naebody in the Glentrae district kens me, but there was a gude few o' us chatting in the commercial room, Avhen in walked Carfrae. I never got sic a turn in my life. I saw he was quite a stranger, but he was very free. He said he was travelling for some firm, but I dinna believe that story. He's no the look o't. I think he maun be a lang Avay doon in the world, for he Avas very shabby, though brushed up as well as might be. I doubt- he said it just as an excuse for asking questions. He said it was a new beat to him, an' he soon got to questioning about Rossan, an' he speered close about me. Naebody could"], [270, "262 DUNCAN MORAY. tell him aucht, though one or two o' them said they thocht there were Morays about here. An then he speered about the new laird, an' what like man he was, saying a near friend of his had seiwed in the family lang syne ; an' he wanted to ken a' about the ither county families round. I just sat quiet an' listened, but I saw some o' them be ginning to look rather queer at him. I think they jaloused something. His questions were no muckle in the way o' commercial business. I soon began to hae a thocht boo it might likely be. I doubt the Elliotts '11 just be the family in Avhose service these Carfraes had been, an' that like eneuch this man kens mair o' the land's early doings than it Avad just suit should come to the licht. It may be wi' him he was in service when he was a young fellow, an' that he was packed off to the colonies to get him oot o' the road, if he kent mair than was convenient. He's a younger man than me ; I wadna say but he maun be near about the laird's own age.

Duncan Moray's own face had grown very grave and thoughtful, as he listened to his father's recital. The old man's conjectures seemed certainly to be amply justified by the circumstances, and as the sinister determined face and resolute aspect of Mr. Elliott rose before his mental vision, the prospect of the appearance on the scene of a man possessed of undesirable knowledge respecting the laird's antecedents, seemed to him to open the way for darker possibilities and more serious dangers than any he had yet feared. He did not deem it neces sary, however, to take his father into his confidence. The old man was quite enough upset by the unex pected meeting. Graver dread would come fast enough when he saAv Mr. Elliott himself, and per ceived what sort of a man it was who was to be subjected to the unpleasant process of haAing black mail levied upon him, in order to preA7ent the offences of his youth being disinterred for the"], [272, "DUNCAN MORAY. 264 inspection of his neighbours. He only said care lessly \u2014 ' That's like enough. But I doubt the man '11 find he's mistaken his road if he comes here to try an' bully the land.' ' That a' depends on what he kens. But I dinna like the thocht o' a man I ken doesna stick at murder coming on sic an errand. Forbye that, I'm no easy about letting him gang scot free wi' that puir lad's bluid on his head.' ' Why, father, what wad ye do ? Try to put a rope round a man's neck for a murder done forty years ago ? There's nae sense in that. Wha wad be a haet the better ? Like enough the man may have a wife and family to be beggared and dis graced. Na, na, it's different when a man's caught, redhanded, but when it's a story forty years auld, it's naething but a senseless bit o' revenge.' ' I hope yere right, for I'd be loth to move in the matter. I only Avish I could find out if the laird had eArer a Carfrae in his service. I darena ask Miss Elliott, for fear she might say something to her father. But if I could find out it was so, I'd"], [273, "DUNCAN MORAY. 265 no stick at speaking out plain to Mr. Elliott, an' telling him, if he'd aught to fear, I could quieten the fellow for him. I'd risk onything for yon dear lassie's sake.' 'Dinna ye worry yersel' about the matter, father. The fellow '11 nae get into the neighbour hood wi'oot our getting scent o't. I think we'll do weel to take Gillespie into confidence. There's nae hurry about the matter until the laird comes.

Ye're tired, I see. That makes ye think too much o' the matter. Duncan Moray's prescription was not without its effect. Still he saw that his father remained someAA7hat absent and thoughtful, and lamented the improbability of a visit from Isabel to cheer him up. When fully a week had passed, and he felt convinced she must have returned home, he even began to meditate whether, if he met her, he would not suggest the advisability of her coming to"], [274, "DUNCAN MORAY. 266 finish her sketch before the advancing year had changed the colouring enough to alter the aspect of the scene. But though he possessed a consider able amount of audacity, so cool an assumption of the character of art critic struck him as being a little too daring. Shortly, hoAvever, a very unexpected turn was given to the thoughts of both father and son. A letter, bearing the Vienna post mark, arrived for old Moray, which he read with evident surprise, and then handed to his son without comment. It Avas from Mr. Elliott. His visit to Vienna had, he said, been folloAved by a curious result. From one of the secretaries at the Embassy he had heard that a Mr. Elliott, who had been all his life in the consular service, was living in Vienna, and on inquiry had found him to be a distant connection. LiA7ing as a pensioner in his house was an old wo man, Avho had spent nearly her whole life in service in his family. She was past eighty, but wonderfully Aigorous in mind, and possessed of an excellent memory. She knew a great deal about the early traditions of the Rig Mains story, and had, Mr."], [275, "DUNCAN MORAY. 267 Elliott said, told him a good deal that was new to him. He could not say she had thrown any absolutely fresh light upon the subject, but he could not but think it possible she had indicated directions in which clues might be found, if, as he hoped might be the case, Mr. Moray possessed documentary evidence which might supplement oral traditions. ' You will wonder,' he con tinued, ' why I should write this information to you, instead of waiting to see you on my return to BeechAvood. Well, that is a question rather difficult to answer; but I think my main reason is that I fear my predecessors have not shown a very honourable alacrity in really examining into a question Avhich should certainly be settled on moral rather than on legal grounds ; and that I am anxious it should at once be seen that my own sentiments on the subject are different from theirs.' Father and son looked at each other in silence, after Duncan had read the letter, both simul taneously struck by that pang of self-reproach which comes quickly and keenly to every generous nature with the perception of a"], [276, "DUNCAN MORAY. 268 possibility of having wronged another by an un merited suspicion. The tone of Mr. Elliott's letter was extremely frank and straightforward. Nothing could indicate more strongly a desire to act honourably in respect of the Morays' claims. 'What do ye make o't, Duncan?' his father asked, after a moment's silence. ' It seems fair and straightforAvard.' ' I doubt we've wranged the man.' ' It looks like it, at least in this case. Yet for the life o' me, father, I canna bring mysel' to believe in him.' ' Ye're prejudiced, Duncan.' ' Hoo wad that be? I ken naught against him, beyond what ye ken yersel'. Wait till ye see him, father. An', mind ye, Gillespie and Dempster baith took the same notion. I'm sorry if we've Avranged him, but if we have, I can but say there's sic a thing as a sheep in wolf's clothing. I wad like to take that letter to the Carse, an' see what Gillespie thinks. I could tell him, too, about the ither matter.'"], [277, "DUNCAN MORAY. 269 ' Ye can do that. 1 wad like to hear Gillespie's opinion mysel'.' Duncan Moray accordingly rode down the valley the next morning, to the Carse, on his double errand. Mr. Gillespie read the letter and returned it, echoing Duncan's own remark. ' It seems fair eneuch.' ' That's what we a' say, Gillespie,' replied Duncan, laughing. ' The queer thing is that uane o' us seem to find ower much satisfaction in the fairness.' The factor gave his shoulders a shrug. ' It's ill grudging a man his due. I canna but say, sae far as I've had a chance to judge, he's fair an' honour able eneuch in his way o' doing business. All the same, I'll no buy the Rig Mains o' ye this minute, at five years' purchase.' ' Ye shall get it for twa,' Avas the laconic reply. ' But I've a queer story for ye, Gillespie. If we've a bad one to deal with, I'll lay it's nae one o' yer pettifogging evil doers ; but a man that'll stick at naething, if it's really important to him. That's just the notion the look o' him wad gie me.'"], [278, "270 DUNCAN MORAY. He told the story of his father's unexpected encounter, and shrewd deductions. The factor looked very grave. ' It looks like as yer father has hit on the right explanation,' he said. ' It's an ugly looking business.' ' He's set on the notion that if the fellow comes about, he'll warn the laird himsel'. I doubt, Gillespie, it's nae the laird that'll maist need warning.' ' Faith, ye're richt there. If the felloAv kens aught that's at all serious for the laird, I wadna gie him ten minutes to live if he tries ony intimi dating game.

If it wasna for the young leddy, I'd say yer father had best haud his tongue, an' leave twa rascals to settle their ain business.

The whole transaction seemed to him to speak of lofty independence, of a nature too inately noble and true to be in the least influenced by the sordid aims and mean jealousies which underlay all these social animosities, and he rejoiced in such evidence of the spirit of the woman he worshipped. It did not occur to him that her action under the circumstances was exactly what his own would have been, and that the hidden source of his satis faction lay in an intuitive perception of spirits nearly akin. Noble natures are occasionally prone greatly to admire their own reflections Avithout discovering that they are looking into mirrors.

What Avas due to Mr. Elliott but the credit of Avillingness to act in an honourable upright way, aud examine a difficult question solely from its moral, not its legal aspect?

Think of it as he Avould, Duncan Moray could not but admit that facts all tended to prove that they had formed an unjust judgment of Mr. Elliott's character, alloAving themselves to look at him through the coloured glasses of an old vaguely defined prejudice, aud that their attitude to him at the moment ought, unquestionably, to be streaked with contrition.

THE COUNTY MARVELS. \"ISABEL ELLIOTT, released from the claims of society, and indulging apparently in the romantic occupation of gazing at the moon, sat at her bedroom window, on the night after the laAvn tennis party at Southend, musing somewhat rue fully. These rural experiences were worse than London. There the various episodes of malice aud meanness were so crushed and crowded together, that their individual features of ugliness were lost in a general impression of vague un pleasantness. Here no such gracious veil of indistinctness was vouchsafed to them, and the drama of that afternoon, in all its isolated sharp ness of outline, appeared very repulsiA7e to her moral vision. The flame of her generous indigna tion at the supercilious insolence displayed towards Mrs. Millar by Lady Sinclair and Mrs. Grierson"], [284, "276 DUNCAN MORAY. had burned strongly, but it had been suddenly extinguished by a cold breath of contempt, aroused by the evident satisfaction of her hostess at the perception that the guests she had received with such extreme adulation had beeu severely morti fied.

Little did she dream of the strange romance which fate was even then weaving, and of which she was the central figure ; her horizon shadowed with vague menaces of some intangible peril, while three stalwart leal hearted Scots were, in purpose, buckling on their armour for her defence from every danger, yet all alike daunted by a dread that the blow would be dealt by a hand from which they were absolutely powerless to shield her. In her irritated condition over night she had"], [285, "DUNCAN MORAY. 277 almost resolved that she would invent some excuse for returning home the next day. But in the morning better councils prevailed. The step would be one on which Walter Millar, at least, could hardly fail to put a wrong construction. Moreover, having slept off her irritation, she re cognized the ungraciousness of the design. How ever despicable the Southend tactics might be, they merited no scourging at her hands. Ultimately her visit was prolonged some days beyond her first intention, some trifling accident having happened in the stables, Avhich she divined would render it inconvenient to send her home. She steadily declined, however, being driven in her little basket-pony carriage, by Mrs. Millar, to call at the Rowans, pleading her preference for rambles on foot, and the ease with which she could pay the visit on her way home.

Walter Avill have to be very explicit before he wins any response, and I certainly should not Avish him to take any such decisive step at present.' ' It had certainly better be put off until such time as you cease to care for Miss Elliott's society, for it will abruptly terminate all acquaintance.

' It is much too soon to see anything more than that they get on very well together, and time is all in Walter's favour. Miss Elliott is, as yet, new to her position, and its advantages are more apparent to her than its drawbacks. But ere long she must come to feel what a serious draw back the want of a fortune suitable to your position is, and then, without being in the least mercenary, she cannot fail to see one great advantage which a marriage with Walter would bring her. I think you do not like Miss Elliott, Helen, and prejudice is swaying your judgment.' ' I do not dislike her,' Helen Millar replied, not perfectly truthfully. Her parents had grown up in quiet contentment with a comfortable position, and the ambition developed by their subsequent acquisition of wealth had never entirely under mined the cheerful good nature born of such circumstances. Helen Millar had groAvu up amidst the struggle to achieve a more important social"], [288, "DUNCAN MORAY. 280 position, and her ambition was more tinged with a sort of envying cynicism. She cherished a jealous suspicion that Isabel Elliott, in spite of her un assuming frankness, indulged in a complacent sense of the superiority of the Elliotts over the Millars. ' Of one thing I am certain,' she added, 'Miss Elliott will not be easily won by anyone, and she will certainly not, be won by Walter. The man who wins her will have to be strong. Walter is not strong.' 'You are talking nonsense,' responded her mother, 'and 1 am tired, so good night.' Isabel Elliott practised diplomacy enough to ask to be driven to BeechAvood on a day Avhen she knew Mrs. Millar had engagements at home. Thus she secured the chance of calling at the RoAvans unaccompanied. Mrs. Grierson received her \"with unabated cordiality. ' I thought you had gone ' home without stopping, and Avas preparing to folloAV. So you can stay over a week at Southend, and cannot even spare me a day !

One of them got loose in the night, and there was a scrimmage. Two were slightly hurt, so I could not ask for the use of the carriage.' ' I could have sent for you.'

You have become quite a personage, I can assure you. There was a chanty ball in Kirkness tAVO nights since ; I had to go. Lady Sinclair Avas there. She besought me to use my influence \u2014 as if I had any. Everyone was asking me about you, and wherever they began, they always came round to the one question. Was it true that you had refused a pressing invita tion to meet the Duke's people at Heathfield?' 'Unhappy creatures to have nothing more interesting to talk about ! But Avere I minded to retract, you must surely see hoAv impossible you"], [290, "282 DUNCAN MORAY. are making it for me to do so. If I Avent to Heathfield now, my refusal would have all the appearance of a silly vulgar artifice to attract attention. You can hardly suppose I would voluntarily place myself in a position so ridiculous and contemptible.' ' You are certainly a most appallingly logical young woman. I only wish your father was here to make you conduct yourself with discretion.' ' You will hardly get him to interfere. He is a most judicious parent, and leaves me to make myself happy my own way.' ' By the bye, though, Avho is your father? Of course, in a certain sense, I know, but what has he done with himself all his life? He must have been a most persistent Avanderer in his youth, or there must have been a most amazing number of roaming Elliotts loose upon the world. Every elderly acquaintance I have, who has ever been a hundred miles from the British coast, is quite certain he or she met him somewhere. They bewildered me with their geographical queries until I came away with a hazy idea that the Blue"], [291, "DUNCAN MORAY. 283 Danube was somewhere in Peru, and that the Andes abutted on the North Pole.' ' Indeed,' replied the girl, with a sudden sense of slight annoyance, ' I can tell you very little about my father's early life. All his wanderings were over before I was born. But I know he was a great deal abroad in his youth. I have heard him speak of having been in Russia a good deal, but I know very little about his travels.' She rose to go as she spoke, during the rest of her drive she revoh7ed the ideas aroused in her mind by Mrs. Grierson's question. How strangely little she did knoAv of her father's early life. How far in the dim future seemed the time when she her self should reach the age of forty years. Yet her father had been past that age when she was born, and all she knew of his prior life Avas that he had been at Oxford, and had lived abroad. She felt an uneasy dread that her total inability to answer such questions as had just been put to her might tend to increase the prevalent suspicions of which he had warned her, through seeming to imply that the past was a forbidden, or at least an avoided"], [292, "284 DUNCAN MORAY. subject in the family circle. She forthwith re solved to write and tell him he might as well at once note down a few leading facts for her use, such as might enable her to meet investigations without betraying a degree of ignorance calcu lated to excite remark. She carried out this purpose the following morn ing, in much elation of spirit, for the post brought her a letter from her father, containing the same in formation as communicated to the Morays. In the afternoon she walked into Rossan to post the letter, and pay a visit at the manse. There she was naturally rigorously cross-examined regarding her visit to Southend, and Mrs. Fordyce waxed so impressively enthusiastic over the excellences of the Millars in general, and of Walter Millar in particular, that in Isabel's unsuspecting breast the idea suddenly took shape that the good woman cherished aspirations on behalf of her own daughters, and careering wildly away on this misleading hnpression, she filled poor Mrs. For dyce's bosom with delusive joy, by the heartiness of her concurrence in these encomiums."], [293, "DUNCAN MORA Y. 285 ' Poor woman,' she said to herself, as she Avalked homeward, ' I wish he would take one of her daughters. Such uninteresting girls, and not much provision for them, I suppose. No wonder she is anxious.' Then she stopped short, flushed a little, and Avalked on Avith rather a curious expression on her face. The promptness with which she had pronounced the daughters of the manse to be quite unsuitable for Duncan Moray had flashed across her thoughts. No such uusuitability had struck her with reference to Walter Millar. How was that? The question was easier to ask than to answer. She vaguely felt that it seemed to resolve itself into one of clothes. Duncan Moray, like everyone else, would gain or lose some superficial advantage according to the quality of his tailor ; but it seemed to her as if Walter Mil lar's whole social status Avould be risked by his ap pearance in a clumsily made suit of clothes, from a country tailor's work room. While, by a sort of parallel reasoning, Louisa Fordyce, for instance, would be quite lifted to his level were she placed"], [294, "DUNCAN MORAY. 286 in the hands of a first rate dressmaker. Certainly it was somewhere in that direction the fitness lay. This somewhat desultory course of reflection was interrupted by the appearance of Duncan Moray himself, leisurely returning from his visit to the Carse. Her face lighted up at sight of him in a way which Avould have carried a host of flattering sensations to the hearts of many men. Duncan Moray only said to himself, ' She has heard from her father.' Thus he saved himself the mortifica tion of being obliged, when they met, to take a lower place. ' I am so glad I have met you,' she said. ' You have heard from my father ? ' ' My father had a letter from the laird this morn- ing. ' Yes. He wrote to me also. How strangely things turn out !

' Then, on the spur of the moment, probably for"], [295, "DUNCAN MORA Y. 287 the first time in his life, Duncan Moray made a diplomatic reply. ' The letter has no way altered our opinion o' Mr. Elliott,' he said, 'because there was none to alter. It's an honourable straightfor ward letter, would do credit to any gentleman. But ye must mind, Miss Elliott, the laird is a per fect stranger. We couldn't have aught ye'd call an opinion o' him.' ' You can have a prejudice, though.' He smiled. ' Ye press one close,' lie said. 'But I'll no say but ye're right there. It's easy to have a prejudice an' scarce feel it. I wouldn't say but it's like enough the auld laird beiug so bitter against yer father has raised a sort o' feeling against him. But ye may be sure neither my father nor me will ever be influenced by such clash. We'll form our opinion o' Mr. Elliott when we come to ken him, not before. But he's cer tainly minded we should start with a gude im pression.' E pur si muove ! Duncan Moray's apologetic declaration left Isabel's convictions unaltered. It might be true enough that neither he nor his father"], [296, "288 DUNCAN MORAY. would allow prejudice to influence their judgment. All the same, she felt convinced that if, on making her father's acquaintance, they found themselves forced to form a good opinion of him, it Avould sur prise them much more than if sentence went against him. Feeling, however, that it Avould be indiscreet to pursue the theme, she made inquiries after Mr. Moray. ' He is very well,' Duncan replied, ' but wearying to see ye, I think. It's Aveel ye did not live two centuries ago, Miss Elliott, or I doubt ye'd have stood a chance to be burnt \"for a witch. Ye've cer tainly beAvitched my father. I neA*er in my life ken't him take so sudden a notion o' any one. He's a staunch friend when once he takes up wi' any one. But he's slow in general to make friends.' Then Duncan Moray made acquaintance with one of the chief charms of Isabel Elliott's face, its rapid changes of expression. A sharp sense of contrast brought a shadow over it as she replied, ' It is love at first sight on both sides, then,' Avith a strong inclination to add, 'I envy you your father.'"], [297, "DUNCAN MORAY. 289 Then a sudden flash of amusement chased away the shadow, aud she involuntarily laughed. ' What are ye thinking o' the now ? ' he asked. Miss Elliott had landed herself iu a dilemma, and she looked up at the speaker, colouring a little, and hesitating. To banter Duncan Moray about the manse projects seemed to her a proceeding some what Avantiug in dignity ; yet to refuse, now, to tell him what had caused her merriment, savoured of vulgar schoolgirl coquetry. ' Tell me,' he said, as she hesitated. Aud if ra ther dangerous depths of expression came into his blue eyes, the face Avas not one to repel confidence. The girl Avho could have deemed Duncan Moray a man Avhom it was necessary to keep at a distance, must have been in desperate straits to find a bad opinion of one. ' I have just come from the manse,' she replied, courageously choosing the least formidable horn of the dilemma. ' I suppose that suggested the train of ideas.

' Then he stopped abruptly, and grew crimson. -I beg your pardon, Miss Elliott, I did na mean that to slip oot, but ye fair dazed me.' His apologies however were useless. His crest-fallen confusion, on the top of his startled amazement, were too much for Isabel Elliott, and she was shaking with laughter. With difficulty she managed to say, ' Tell Mr. Moray I will see him to-morrow,' and with a friendly wave of her hand she pursued her way. Duncan rode slowly on, wearing that dejected air which, alike in men and dogs, indicates a vivid consciousness of having got into trouble. Isabel appeared with her sketch at Craignellan the next day, and Avas welcomed by Adam Moray with an almost parental affection which deeply touched her. The effusive cordiality of the Millars, and the more polished friendliness of Mrs. Grierson, had equally inclined her to shrink into"], [299, "DUNCAN MORAY. 291 herself; but the grave tenderness of the old farmer caused her whole nature to expand.

Secondly, because I was disgusted with the way those Avomen went on. I wish you could have seen them, Mr. Moray. You would not wonder that I was angry enough to be rather cool.

He laid a hand carressingly on her shoulder, and answered in a slightly tremulous voice, ' God grant ye may never need it my dear, but should the day ever come when ye dinna ken whar to seek a friend, never fear but ye'll find a father's luve waiting for ye at Craignellan.'

Adam Moray had contrived to rivet very firmly, that morning, the bonds in which he held Isabel Elliott. Brought thus into close contact with an honourable unselfish nature, devoid of all narrow minded prejudice or intolerance, judging both men and actions with broad charity and kindly sym pathy, and assigning values solely according to inate qualities, not according to artificial standards, the world in which she had been wont to move seemed, through all its glitter and assumption, to grow more mean, shallow, and contemptible, than even in her most exasperated moments she had"], [307, "DUNCAN MORAY. 299 painted it.

Yes, he was certainly annoyed by the question. She knew the general tone of his letters too well not to feel certain of the fact. And that it should be a fact deepened the sense of vague uueasiness respecting his past life, which had been increasing gradually upon her, since the sudden change in her position had enabled her to see beyond the contracted horizon of her father's dull orderly London existence. She was sitting by an open window revolving the subject, when she thought she caught the sound of wheels in the distance, accompanied by much trampling of hoofs. Shortly the house re sounded with a somewhat imperious knock at the door. Who could it be ? Surely not visitors at that early hour ! In a few moments the door of the room was opened by Marion, with even more than her usual dignity, and Avith the laconic announcement \u2014"], [310, "302 DUNCAN MORAY. ' Leddy Sinclair, mem.'

Isabel rose to receive her guest in no small surprise, and forthwith Adam Moray's remarks came forcibly back to her mind. There were certainly two Lady Sinclairs. The somewhat free careless-mannered woman who entered the Beech wood drawing-room was a very different person from the insolently supercilious dame who had treated Mrs. Millar with such scant courtesy. ' Well, you superb piece of family pride,' she said, as she greeted Isabel cordially, ' here I am. Are you satisfied now ? ' ' What in the world do you mean ?

'It is perfection,' Lady Sinclair said, as they at last returned slowly towards the bouse. ' Just the place for a family with deep roots. Heathfield is nothing to it.

We are quite alone for a day or two. I will send you home. I know you have no carriage yet.' Isabel shook her head. ' I positively refused Mrs. Grierson. I could not do it.' ' Yet vou went to Southend.'"], [319, "DUNCAN MORAY. 311 ' The one visit I had time for, and rightly paid to the first person who offered friendly offices. EA7ery day, now, the probability of my father's sudden return will increase, and I have still much to settle. I cannot, as you know, return your visit, but give me your invitation, after my father comes, and I will gladly accept it.' With that they parted, more cordially on Isabel's side than she could have deemed possible a few horns since. She could not endorse Mrs. Grierson's assertion. Lady Sinclair did improve on acquaintance \u2014 had at least done so for her. There was no room for doubt. The true nature of the woman lay beloAv; her less attractive aspect was a superficial crust ; and as she reflected over the matter, a strong suspicion grew upon the girl that the crust was a sort of defensive armour, assumed for reasons only to be fathomed by means of intimate acquaintance with the tenor of Lady Sinclair's past life, therefore unfathomable by her, and probably by everyone else in the neighbourhood. Her sketch still needed a few finishing touches,"], [320, "312 DUNCAN MORAY. so she went up to Craignellan the next afternoon to put them in, also with the design of telling Adam Moray how thoroughly Lady Sinclair had enabled her to confirm his assertion that she had a better side. ' I do not know if I am right,' she said, ' but it seems to me as if she to some extent puts on that manner, for a purpose.' ' I wadna say but ye may be richt. Of course I haA7e na' seen muckle o' her, but she cam' up here several times Avhen the last elections Avere on, an' I could see, when she was talking quietly wi' me, her manner kind o' softened down, and Avasna just sae blunt an' free.' 'Do you think she is happy?' What sort of man is Sir Robert?' ' He's a man folk ken little about. He's a gude bit aulder than Leddy Sinclair, an' he suffers a heap wi' the gout. I never heard a whisper o' their being aught but gude friends. I've heard said she's a grand nurse, an' unco gude to him when he gets a bad attack o' gout.

That's why he lives sae quietly, and gangs about sae little.' ' Then she may really be a Avidow one of these days,' said Isabel with a laugh. ' That will be an important event for you, Mr. Moray.' 'How?' 'She told me, to-day, she had been deeply in love with your son ever since he threw Mr. Baillie over the Avail, and that if she was ever left a widow she intended to marry him.' ' Gudesake ! That wad be promotion for Dun can. She'll be a gran' catch. I doubt she'll hae a fine jointure. But Duncan '11 hae to find an ither hame for himsel'; I'm nae used to the way o' fine leddies, au' I'm too auld tae hae my hoose turned upside down. I've a notion that the rueing will tread close on the heels o' the wooing.' ' \" Married to-day, and marred to-morrow,\" as old Carfrae used to say,' said Isabel. Adam Moray could not repress an involuntary start. By the merest accident, just when he least expected it, a chance Avas given him of securing"], [322, "DUNCAN MORAY. 314 the information he earnestly desired, from the very person he had most dreaded to question on the subject of his fears. Fortunately for him Isabel's low sketching stool Avas placed just before the bench on Avhich he was sitting, so his sudden movement escaped her notice. ' Carfrae,' he repeated, after a moment's silence. ' That's a Scotch name.' ' I daresay they were Scotch. They were old retainers of the Elliotts. The Carfrae I remember was a very old man, when I was quite a little child. My father's aunt, Mrs. Ross, Avas alive then, and liAred not far from London. I used to be taken down sometimes to spend the day with her, and she used always to take me to see this old man. He lived at the lodge. She said his Avife had been my father's nurse. By the way, he always seemed to have that old proverb on his tongue, I should think she had not made him very happy. I used to wonder what it meant ? I did not like going there. They always sighed and shook their heads over me, and talked mysteriously about Mr. Gerald. I used to wonder who they meant ? There was"], [323, "DUNCAN MORAY. 315 someone else, too, they used to sigh over a great deal, I could never make out who it was.' ' I suppose that auld man won't be living noo ?' ' Oh dear, no. I think he died before Aunt Bella did, and she has been dead more than ten years.' ' Had he ony family ? ' I do not know whether he had. But I was never quite clear about the Carfraes. There were several of them. I remember Aunt Bella saying they had been retainers of the Elliotts for some generations. Now I think I have finished my sketch. I shall only spoil it if I go on touching it up indefinitely.' Not without an effort could Adam Moray rouse himself to comment upon the sketch with sufficient show of interest to imply that their conversation was as much of the nature of indifferent chat to him as to Isabel herself. ' I'm a fine one to pass judgment on pictures,' he said. ' But I can only say, onybody that had seen that sketch wad ken BeecliAvood whenever he saw"], [324, "DUNCAN MORAY. 316 it. But is it really finished? Will ye no be coming back ony mair ? ' ' Only to see you.' 'Will ye do that?' \u00ab Need you ask, Mr. Moray ? ' ' Weel, Miss Elliott, I'll aye be proud to see ye, an' whenever it suits ye to come on a Friday, that's the day a visitor's maist welcome to me. It's the market day in Kirkness, an' Duncan's maistly aAva the hale day. I do feel it a bit lanely whiles.' ' Why should you not come and see me ? ' 'Na, na. I'll nae do that. We're nae but farmers ye ken. Whiles I feel a bit afraid the laird may tak' it ill Ave've made sae free wi' ye as Ave have. But I'll no set foot in Beechwood House till the laird himsel' asks me.' ' Well, I will bring the sketch on Friday, trimmed and mounted, for you to look at before I send it away. And now good-bye. It is growing late.' Adam Moray's face was very grave as he walked back to the house. His surmises seemed to have become almost certainty. Mere coincidences could hardly haA7e formed so connected a chain. The"], [325, "DUNCAN MORAY. 317 man who was such a bitter memory to him, a murderer in cold blood, was seeking to learn all he could about a neighbourhood in Avhich he had been alarmed by hearing the name of Moray, in order to find out hoAV far it was safe for him to intrude himself upon another man with Avhose family his own had been long ago connected. The old man was well aware of Mr. Dempster's avowed opiniou that there had been something more wrong in the laird's past life than his Oxford indiscretions. What might not the transactions be, in which such a man as Carfrae had been mixed up ? And what a threatening cloud was this upon the horizon of the girl whose sense of honour and rectitude was so keen, and who stood so sadly alone in the world I Yet half Adam Moray's anxiety was gone. ' I'll Avarn him noo, whatever happens,' he said to his son. ' I've got the information frae Miss Elliott in a way that'll do nae hurt to tell him, an' I care na a haet if he is angered. The first moment I can, I'll tell him a' I ken about Carfrae, an' put him on his guard.'"], [326, "318 DUNCAN MORAY. ' Ye've mair need to do that by Carfrae, father. Wait till ye've seen the laird. He'll shoot the fellow like a dog, if he really kens aught that wad be serious. It wad be queer if retribution fell on him that way, after all these years.' ' God forbid, for the young leddy's sake. But eh, Duncan, my heart's heavy wi' the thocht of her, whiles.' True to her promise, Isabel paid frequent visits to Craignellan on Fridays, and roamed about the farm with the old man, or watched the process of cheese-making, and if she did not become a thorough proficient in all the mysteries of farming, she at least learned to estimate at its true value the knowledge displayed by many a fluent oracle on agricultural subjects, whom she had heard enlightening duly impressed audiences in London drawing-rooms. Duncan she very rarely saw. It had not been without ulterior motives that his father had named Fridays as the days when her visits would be most welcome. ' He could na but learn to luve her,' he sighed to himself, ' and what could come o't but a sair heart.' So Isabel came"], [327, "DUNCAN MORAY. 319 and went, and not the most lynx-eyed of observers could have detected that Duncan Moray took any heed of the same. But there was one living creature which could have told a tale, and it may be that Duncan's horse, as he munched his corn on Friday nights, meditated somewhat sarcastically on the perverse Avays of men. Why, when they left Kirkness unusually early, should he be hustled along the road at inconvenient speed, and be alloAved to take his time when they chanced to be late ? It was one of those things at which a horse could only feel disgust ; it was useless for him to attempt to understand it."], [328, "DUNCAN MORAY. 320 CHAPTER XV. STRANGE SYMPTOMS. QHORTLY afterwards came the expected letter. \u2022^ Mr. Elliott had landed at Dover the previous day, and Avould arrive at Beechwood the folloAving morning. To confess the truth, Isabel received the intelligence with a sigh. She had been very happy in her congenial solitude, and was now to some extent to plunge into the unknown. For as long as she could remember anything, her father had been in the habit of leaving the house before ten in the morning, and not returning until about six in the evening, so during the day she had been wholly mistress of her own actions. Now he would be about the house the whole day. What Avould be the result of such a complete change of circumstances ? Hoav would he occupy himself? What demands would he make upon her time and attention ? These were not questions she could"], [329, "DUNCAN MORAY. 321 face wholly Avithout misgivings. She knew very little of her father's methods of life, but she shrewdly divined that rural solitude and the beauties of nature would not possess quite so absorbing a charm for him as for her. She greeted him, however, the following morn ing Avarmly enough, exclaiming as he entered the house \u2014 ' Why, you are quite lame, father. What has happened ? ' ' Nothing very alarming. I caught my foot in a torn door mat, and gave my instep a nasty twist. It is only a trifle, but it groAvs painful if I Avalk much, or have to keep a boot on for any length of time. I shall be able to let it rest now, which will soon set it all right. I need not ask how you are. You have clearly found the elixir of life in Scotch air. I expected to find you worn out with ennui, and to be met by a frantic entreaty to take you back to London.' ' And yet it seems you received my letters.' ' Oh yes. I imagined them a trifle hyperbolical, a sort of attempt to produce a result by simulat- w"], [330, "322 DUNCAN MORAY. ing it. I am glad contentment has settled down upon your soul. I only hope it may prove con tagious.' Isabel shot a hasty glance at him. There was something about him different from his usual half cynical, bantering tone, a something Avhich jarred here with an impression of unreality, and she could certainly not return the compliment as to appear ance. His face was suggestive of one of his darker moods, with a somewhat worn, haggard look superadded. ' You look very tired,' she said. ' Did you sleep at Kirkness?' ' No ; I came by night. I only arrived this morning, and I did not manage to get much sleep. I am growing old, Isabel. Time was when I thought nothing of losing many a night's rest, now I am conscious of the loss of one. HoweA'er, a bath and some breakfast will make me quite another man, as the quack medicines promise.' The prescription certainly Avorked well. Still, as Mr. Elliott sat by the fire, resting his foot, and talking to his daughter, the feeling grew upon her"], [331, "DUNCAN MORAY. 323 that he was a greatly altered man since they had parted less than two months ago. The change was one of those subtle ones which defies analysis; which, when you try to grasp it, eludes your touch, but which, when you do not concentrate your attention upon it, asserts itself with convincing force. Isabel's perception of it prompted her to say: ' I fear you have had much trouble with Eric' ' With Eric,' he repeated, in an absent tone, as if his thoughts had flown in quite another direc tion. Then he gave a slight start. ' Eric ! yes, confound him. But that is over, thank heaven ! ' 'What had he done?' ' Pretty nearly everything he should not have done. But the thing which detained me so long was that he had nearly involved the firm in a troublesome law suit. However, he is packed off at last, and I hope I may never hear of him again.' Isabel was longing to ask what her father had learned about the land question, but she prudently forbore to pelt him with subjects which were, to"], [332, "DUNCAN MORAY. 324 say the least of it, of doubtful acceptability, so she told him of Lady Sinclair's visit. ' Sir Robert is her husband ? Then he is not the eldest son?' ' No. He succeeded his brother.' ' I remember Robert. He must be a few years older than myself. We used to be playmates as children. I remember, about the last time I ever saw him, he gave me an awful thrashing. We quarrelled about something, and he punished me most severely. I shall be very glad to renew my acquaintance with him. I remember hearing that she was a A7ery clever woman. I am glad you like her.' ' I certainly like her better than anyone else I have seen about here, save old Mr. Moray,' replied his daughter. She could not resist throwing out this feeler after the information she so ardently desired. She marked a sudden contraction of her father's face. ' Ah ! those Morays,' he said. ' That tiresome business of theirs must be settled in some way.' 'What have you heard, father? I hope it is"], [333, "DUNCAN MORAY. 325 something which makes their claim to the land clear.' ' Faith, you are disinterested ! ' ' I am convinced they think the land is honestly theirs, and I would rather they had it, than that we should keep it with any doubts on the point.' ' They have been impressing that view of the matter upon you, I suppose,' replied Mr. Elliott, with a perceptible sneer. ' That was certainly judicious, seeing the ultimate question of the disposal of the land will rest with you.' Isabel coloured. She saw the mistake she had made, but she answered calmly : ' It is needless to combat that opinion. It Avill not survive one interview with Mr. Moray. But what did you learn which made you write to him? ' ' Well, little enough, beyond finding out that it is possible inquiries, in the past, have been made in a wrong direction. The woman I saw had known, in her youth, an old Avoman who had been in the wicked Colonel's service. She firmly believed there had been cheating of some kind, and always harped upon it \u2014 why, if all was fair, did the"], [334, "326 DUNCAN MORAY. colonel employ a different firm from the one he generally employed, to manage the business? This was quite a new idea to me. I had always re garded the break up of the firm which generally managed all the estate business as a hopeless im pediment in the way of getting any information. But if this be true, and it should chance that Mr. Moray can trace among his old relative's papers the name of any firm with which he seemed to have transacted business, it is possible some moral, if not legal proof might be forthcoming. I would not for a moment hold out for legal proof, if the moral proof was good.' ' I told them you would not,' Isabel exclaimed, triumphantly. ' From Avhich fact I gather that they did not do me the honour to believe as much. Well, they have good right to feel doubtful about Elliotts in general, and some cause to be suspicious about me in particular. Moreover, I do honestly admit my wish to move in the matter is mainly prompted by a hope of thus getting rid altogether of them and their claim. Your fortune will not be a large one,"], [335, "DUNCAN MORAY. 327 Isabel. I am too well fixed in old grooves to meddle with the entail, and succeeding to the pro perty in such ruinous condition, at my age, I can not hope to raise the rental much. This suspicion, even if not likely to be legally sustainable, must to some extent depreciate the selling price of the land. If I could set it at rest for good, your cousin would probably gladly buy it of you at a good value, or the Morays might be willing to rent it. In either case it would make a considerable differ ence to your small income. I believe it is good land.' Isabel made no reply, but there was a setting of her mouth, Avhich, had he observed it, might have convinced Mr. Elliott that she had fully developed opinions of her own upon the point in question. She was in truth grieA7ously disappointed, although she felt that she was both unreasonably and un gratefully so. She had been rejoicing iu the belief that her father's action in this matter Avould be a strong and sure foundation for unhesitating con viction, on her own part, in the honourable integrity of his character ; such as would enable her to re-"], [336, "328 DUNCAN MORAY. gard with contemptuous indifference any disparag ing theories regarding him which might exist in the neighbourhood. And now it appeared that his action was solely prompted by family, if not actually by personal interest. His anxiety for her welfare could not be held in any way discreditable to him. Still, in this particular instance, she could not but feel that a view of the question from the standing point of that high sense of honour to Avhich a possibility of reaping any advantage from a questionable source is intolerable, would have afforded her far deeper gratification. After a brief silence, Mr. Elliott gave vent to a yawn. ' This sprained foot is a confounded nuis ance,' he said. ' Bad enough if one was in London, and could get oneself driven to one's club. But what on earth can one do in a savage solitude like this?' ' Could you not hire some sort of conveyance from Kirkness, for a time ? ' Mr. Elliott frowned, and answered in a tone which seemed to imply that the suggestion was by no means agreeable. ' No, I don't want to go"], [337, "DUNCAN MORAY. 329 driving about in some crazy old trap. Besides they always send you brutes of horses, which bring you to immortal smash, and probably land you in a law suit. I must just content myself, for the time, with strolling about the grounds, as far as I can stand it.

We should be pretty nearly a pair of Alexander Selkirks here for long Avithout them. Aud 1 want a good pony for you.' ' For me, father ? ' ' Yes.

Arcadian raptures are all very well, Isabel, but I can tell you you would find it A7ery dull work to live here, from one year's end to another, and never be able to get further than your feet would carry you. I will get a saddle for you also, and then you will be able either to ride or drive about, just as you choose.' The tears rose to Isabel's eyes. She was almost"], [338, "330 DUNCAN MORAY. taken aback at a manifestation of so much interest in her happiness. ' You are very good to me,' she said. ' You are all I have in the world.' Isabel sat speechless. The expression of such a sentiment from a father who had hitherto appeared to be merely good naturedly tolerant of her exist ence was certainly startling, and it seemed a strange comment upon what Adam Moray had lately said to her. If she was really to find herself an object of affection, and source of happiness to her father, life would Avear a different, and less negative aspect than it had hitherto done. Yet, as she sat furtively watching the half sad, half fierce ex pression which had gathered upon his face, she could not but feel that his tenderer mood towards herself was certainly no index of a generally cheerful and genial humour. Her immediate duty was very apparent, to en deavour to find some amusement for his period of enforced inacti\\ity, and she devoted herself to the task with hearty good will ; playing chess with"], [339, "DUNCAN MORAY. 331 him for hours on the stretch, and accompanying him in the short strolls he took about the grounds. ' Miss Elliott is good at devising improvements, Gillespie,' he said one afternoon, a few days after his arrival, when the factor joined them. ' It appears that your and my part of the work is to be to find the money. I should say as far as I am a judge of such points, that what she has already planned will cost about the entire income of the property for some two or three years.' ' Very well, then, father. You can spread the expenditure over twelve or fifteen years. Then it will not exceed a fraction of the yearly income.' ' Humph ! and Avhere do you suppose I shall be tAvelve or fifteen years hence ? ' ' Here, I hope, enjoying a hale old age, in a place you will have improved almost beyond recognition.' ' It strikes me that getting the place into credit able order will be a piece of work that will last my time. Fancy-work will have to wait for my suc cessor. How about those horses, Gillespie ? ' ' I went an' lookit at them, sir. They're a gude"], [340, "332 DUNCAN MORAY. serviceable pair, weel fit for this country, an' I think they're worth the money. They'll send them OAver for ye to look at ony day ye like. An' they've a nice pony, wad suit Miss Elliott fine. I tauld them to send it through wi' the horses, for her to look at.' ' The idea ot my pronouncing on a horse,' said Isabel, laughing. ' I just know Avhich is head and which is tail. That is about all.' ' We'll no let you gang astray.' 'And there goes the first year's surplus cash, Isabel,' added her father. ' No improvements for a year at least. But come, I must get back to the house, my foot begins to ache. We can look over those papers, Gillespie.' An hour or two later Mr. Gillespie met Duncan Moray in Rossan. ' Are ye just frae Beechwood ? ' asked Duncan. ' Yes.' ' What's up wi' the laird ? Naebody's set eyes on him since he arrived. Folk say he's got some thing wrang Avi' his foot.' ' Rubbish,' was the laconic reply."], [341, "DUNCAN MORAY. 333 ' How ? ' ' He's shamming a bit.

' Oh, he isn't shamming for naething. There's some purpose int.' ' But what ? ' ' Ah, that's the question. Likely, I doubt, it'll be to gie him a chance o' lying by quiet for a bit, till he sees how he stands. That's the only reason I can see. But that there is nae muckle wrang wi' his foot I'm as sure as that I'm stauding here. I watched him carefully, an' I could see he forgot whiles. He's cunning though, an' lets on it only hurts him at times. Think ye he'll hae heard aught of that fellow yer father met ? ' ' I wad na' say,' replied Duncan, looking rather grave. He had a private view of his own of that matter, Avhich caused his anxiety to point in a different direction from his father's fears.

' But I scarce like to gang straucht to the hoose an' ask for him, for it's an awkward sort o' a business, at the best.' ' Ay, father, it is an awkward sort o' a business, a' round; an' I'd fain see ye take mair heed to yersel', an' less to the laird.' ' To mysel', Duncan ? ' ' Ay.

I doubt the blude maun be sairly in 'need o' a fresh strain.' At that very moment the Morays themselves Avere under discussion at BeechAvood. ' Do you think, Isabel,' Mr. Elliott had asked, after a long fit of abstracted musing, ' that old Mr. Moray would take it amiss if I asked him to come and see me here?' ' Take it amiss,' repeated his daughter. Certainly not. Why should he do so ? '"], [344, "DUNCAN MORAY. 336 ' For no reasonable cause, certainly.

Complimentary disclaimers of self-evident facts were not in Isabel Elliott's line, even had she not known they would merely have drawn upon her, at any time, sarcastic exposures of their futility. ' At any rate,' she said, ' you never harrassed me with irritating interference. I knew many girls who envied me my freedom.' ' Yes, I believe I may lay claim to that negative virtue ; but I should like in future to feel that my virtues, as far as you are concerned, are a little more positive ; to feel that I am really doing something to make your life bright and pleasant. So accept your pony, my child, as a proof that I am not unconscious of the blessing bestowed"], [350, "342 DUNCAN MORAY. upon me in the possession of such an excellent daughter.' He left the room as he spoke, without giving Isabel time to answer, had she felt so inclined. What could be the meaning of the strange change in him ? His moods, since his arrival at Beech wood, had been by no means of the pleasantest. They had alternated between irritable gloom and that cold, hard cynicism which his daughter found even more repellant. Yet, across these moods came, again and again, these unwonted flashes of a tenderness towards herself which formerly, even in his most amiable moments, he had never mani fested; and their recurrence forbade her to regard them as anything else than symptoms of a sustained state of feeling, even though it might be only intermittently exhibited externally. It almost seemed as if a craving for the love he had never sought to win from his daughter had sprung up within him. Could it be that his return, in the autumn of life, to scenes unvisited since the days of his careless boyhood, had brought to him a suddenly quickened perception of the approach of"], [351, "DUNCAN MORAY. 343 old age, and inclined him to cling more closely to the only being in the world on whom the failing powers of his declining years would have any claim? It was a mystery she could not solve, but she could not conceal from herself that it aroused Avithin her more of vague anxiety than of joyous anticipation. Mr. Elliott looked up from his letters the next morning, to say, ' Dempster Avill not dine here. He wants to get back to Kirkness by dinner-time. I think, Isabel, you had better order dinner at six o'clock. I shall have some letters to write after seeing Dempster, which I should like to get done to-night. I could do them before Mr. Moray comes. What are you going to do this morning?' ' Anything you like.' ' Well I should be glad if you will make a copy for me of this old minute of agreement about the quarry. Dempster wants to take it back with him this afternoon, and I Avant a copy. I am by no means certain that things are exactly as they should be there. The matter must be looked into. If my foot Avill stand it, I am going down presently"], [352, "344 DUNCAN MORAY. to stroll along the edge of the burn, and make some observations for myself.' Isabel set herself to her task, as soon as her domestic duties were accomplished, and found it a slow and tedious piece of work. She was just dravring a deep sigh of relief, over the finishing of the last sentence, Avhen the gong sounded for luncheon. As she crossed the hall, her father came in, limping rather heavily, and looking worn and tired. ' What have you been doing?' she asked. 'You are A'ery lame. You have done too much.' ' No, I got on better than I expected, and grew careless, I suppose. I trod on a stone coming up the drive, and gave my foot a little twist. It was A7ery painful for a moment, but it is better now. I shall not go out again, so it can rest all the after noon. By the bye, what is the meaning of such persistent attentions from the manse ? Have you been greatly cultivating those people ? ' ' Most emphatically, no.' ' Then what in the world dees that woman want? She pounced upon me this morning, came running"], [353, "DUNCAN MORAY. 345 up the drive after me, to beg I Avould use their pony carriage until I had my own carriage ready. Well, Avhy do you laugh ? ' he asked, as Isabel suddenly broke into a low inerry laugh. ' What she probably Avants has just daAvned upon me. I think she wants you for a son-in-law.' ' The devil ! Impossible.' ' By no means. She certainly angled for Mr. Moray. He is an older man than you.' ' Then if you do not wish to be fast bound to me, you had better be sparing of your visits there. If they get a footing in the house, I shall never alloAV you to leave me alone in it. By the way, she extorted a promise from me that I would give her half a sovereign for something or other. She said she would come for it to-morrow morning. Could you manage to take it this afternoon ? What a mercy 1 am not, as they all thought, a bachelor. I should never have dared to stay alone in the house for twenty-four hours.' Isabel duly performed her task in the afternoon, and was reproached with a shade of asperity, Avhich did not escape her amused observation, for having"], [354, "346 DUNCAN MORAY. put herself to so much trouble. Mrs. Fordyce would so willingly have called in the morning for the money. And would not Mr. Elliott let her send the pony carriage to bring him to church on Sun day? And would he not sit in the manse peAv, instead of going up to the gallery? And she hoped he and Miss Elliott would lunch at the manse afterwards. The flame of her maternal ambition had been greatly fanned by Mr. Elliott's appearance. Such a fine looking man ! Just the sort of man who would be sure to marry again, now he had such- a desirable position, if only suit able opportunities were thrown in his way. She felt much less favourably disposed towards Isabel Elliott, after she had somewhat coldly declined all these proffered attentions. ' I think it a very bad sign,' she said afterwards to her husband, ' Avhen a girl shows herself in different about her father coming to church. If Miss Elliott intends to be cold and unfriendly, and so prevent people from caring to go to Beechwood, she will have only herself to thank if Mr. Elliott should end by making some low marriage. Men"], [355, "DUNCAN MORAY. 347 often do that when they are kept out of the society of refined well educated Avomen.' Returning home from her visit to the manse, Isabel met Adam Moray himself, walking slowly along the road, apparently lost in deep thought. Was everyone out of sorts ? she said impatiently to herself, for he too looked grave and anxious. He did not see her until she was quite close to him, and then she observed, that though he smiled as he greeted her, his more cheerful demeanour was assumed with effort. ' Ye're looking very bright an' Aveel, my dear,' he said, almost wistfully. ' I am glad to hear it. I cannot say it is a com mon complaint in the neighbourhood. My father is not looking at all well; and you seem very grave. ' I am sorry to hear that of Mr. Elliott, I hope there is naething wrang ? ' ' Nothing that I know of, beyond what he calls the happy results of succeeding to a grudged in heritance. But oh, Mr. Moray, I have thought so"], [356, "348 DUNCAN MORAY. much of what you said. My father already seems to think so much more of me.' ' I am well pleased to hear that, my dear,' said the old man, earnestly. Try and encourage it. Do all ye can to win an' haud his love. It will make happiness for ye baith.' ' You are coming to see him to-night ? ' ' Yes, I said I wad come. But it'll nae be a lang interview.' ' How so ? ' ' Weel,' \u2014 and the old man spoke with unwonted hesitation \u2014 ' when I got the laird's letter, I hadna come to ony decision aboot the matter, an' I thocht it wad be but right to hear what he wished to say. But I've come since to think differently about it, au' I've quite made up my mind to tell the laird I dinna wish the subject opened again ; that Avhat ever he may have heard, I wad rather it was just let alane.' ' That is very sudden.' ' Weel, yes. I canna say but ye're richt there.' ' And is it quite fair to my father ? ' ' Quite.' The word was sharp and decisive."], [357, "DUNCAN MORAY. 349 'Mr. Elliott has shown a wish to do a' that is right in the matter. If I dinna care for it to be meddled wi', that is my affair.' Isabel stood looking thoughtfully doAvn on the ground. The old man was thAvarting her father in a Avay he little understood, but she could not tell him that which would seem almost to consti tute an appeal to him in her own interests. It was a tangled business. ' 1 think my father will be much disappointed,' she said, at last. ' I canna help that. I've come to see, IVe nae choice what to do. But I'm prood to hear what ye say about yer father an' yersel, my dear. An' I've a great hope now ye may lead a happy au' peacefu' life wi' him at Beechwood.' What could have made him decide so suddenly? Isabel thought, as she pursued her Avay home. He Avould not allow any stories he had heard to influence him. Could it be that the old man had, with a view to the coming intervieAv, been over looking papers, aud made any discoveries ? The enigma Avas insoluble. She prudently resolved,"], [358, "350 DUNCAN MORAY. hoAvever, to say nothing about the meeting, but to leave Mr. Moray and her father to settle their own affairs. The small contrarieties of the day were, however, not quite over. In the drive she encountered Mr. Dempster on foot. ' Are you going to walk all the Avay to Kirkness ? ' she asked. ' No, only to Rossan, where I haA'e some business to settle. I am glad I chanced to meet you, Miss Elliott. If I may venture to interfere, I would urge you to induce Mr. Elliott to consult Dr. Fleming about his foot. Fleming has the reputa tion of being a very clever surgeon, and I suspect the sprain is more severe than Mr. Elliott will allow.' ' What makes you think so ? ' ' Well, his manner this afternoon was not like himself. He had something of the set rigid air of a person resolutely holding down all show of some strong feeling; and, once or twice, for a moment, his face assumed quite a drawn tense look, very suggestive of a spasm of really acute pain. It"], [359, "DUNCAN MORAY. 351 Avould be a very serious thing if inflammation set in.' Isabel looked rather grave. She would probably have looked more so had she knoAvn how contra dictory were the opinions afloat respecting Mr. Elliott's sprained foot. ' My father is a difficult man to persuade to take much care of himself,' she answered. ' But I will try what I can do.' ' Above all things, try and induce him to let the foot haA-e rest.' Mr. Elliott smiled, a sort of grim sardonic smile, as he listened to his daughter's remonstrances. ' Dempster is a fool,' he said. ' One of those men, probably, Avho goes to bed and sends for a doctor if he sneezes twice. My foot will get on very well without Dr. Fleming's care.' 'But you do look rather worn and haggard, father, as if you suffered a good deal of pain.' ' I suffer very little pain ; only a sharp twinge now and then. But who would not look seedy after a whole afternoon at the mercy of a lawyer ? Dempster is a good fellow, but he bores me to"], [360, "DUNCAN MORAY. 352 death, to say nothing of the substance of his communications not being over-pleasant. I fear we shall have trouble with those Edinburgh people.' ' I thought they could do nothing.' ' No more they can, save cause a heap of trouble and exp ense. They seem to have a notion that if they threaten a disturbance I shall pay something to keep things quiet. As if I cared about a scandal. The Elliotts have not borne such a reputation that a little scandal more or less is of much consequence. I hope Avhen they find out I care nothing about it they will let the thing drop. There is the gong, so let us let them drop, and go to dinner.' Isabel took the hint, and tried to talk on in different topics, but her efforts were but poorly seconded, and Mr. Elliott rose from the table the moment dinner Avas over. 'I am going to Avrite letters in the library, until Mr. Moray comes. Dempster has left me several Avhich need attention.' ' You will bring Mr. Moray to the drawing-room for some tea, Avill you not, after you have settled your business ? ' Isabel said. She had a lingering"], [361, "DUNCAN MORAY. 353 dread lest her father might share the bacon-fed rustic delusion from which she had so recently escaped. It would be dreadful if he suggested Mr. Moray taking some refreshment in the kitchen. ' Certainly I Avill, if he will come,' was the instant rejoinder. And with fears set at rest, Isabel betook herself to the drawing-room, and a particularly interesting book. Tea was brought in about nine o'clock, but Isabel, absorbed in her book, read on without heeding it, until she was startled by the clock striking again. Ten o'clock, and no signs of either her father or his visitor. Yet if Mr. Moray had adhered to his resolution, the interview could not be a very long one. Perhaps he had come and gone. A short passage, closed by a door, led from the drawing-room to the hall, so no sounds from Avithout were likely to reach her. She waited a few minutes, then walked along the passage, and opening the door into the hall, stood for a few moments listening. All Avas quiet. She walked across to the library door, and paused a moment. There was no sound of voices. Could her father Y"], [362, "354 DUNCAN MORAY. have fallen asleep after parting from his visitor ? She gently opened the door. The light within the room Avas dim, for it came only from a reading lamp, Avith a green shade OA7er it, standing on a small table beside Avhich her father Avas seated reading. Sundry papers and letters Avere lyiug on his writing table. But he Avas quite alone. ' What has become of Mr. Moray ? ' she asked. ' He has not come. By Jove, and its ten o'clock,' he added, looking at his Avatch. ' I had no idea it Avas so late. I said anytime after eight. Do you think he is likely to come so late as this ? ' 'Certainly not. He meant to come, for I met him this afternoon, and he said he should be here. Something must have happened to prevent him doing so. Perhaps it has begun to rain.' Mr. Elliott rose, and going to the window, drew back the curtain and unclosed a shutter. 'No,' he said, after looking out for a few moments, ' it is quite fine, cloudy, but not very dark. I think the moon is just full. The old gentleman must have changed his mind. I did not ask him to bring"], [363, "DUNCAN MORAY. 355 any papers, so he can hardly have feared the fate of his ancient relative.' ' He Avould not change his mind Avithout some strong reason ; he would think it discourteous. You will hear in the morning from him. You had better come and have some tea now, before it is quite cold.' ' I will come directly, as soon as I have put aAvay these papers.' He shortly followed his daughter to the drav>ing room, and there renewed the subject of then* con versation before dinner. ' I have written a pretty sharp letter for Dempster to use as he pleases,' he said. ' I think it will convince those people they have nothing to hope for from any sensitiveness on my part respecting the family credit. They need not expect to find that sort of sentimentality among men who have knocked about the world as I have. The world is a school in which a man soon learns the advantage of standing firm on his own feet, and not leaning on his family credit, so as to fall a shapeless ruin the moment it is knocked from under him.'"], [364, "356 DUNCAN MORAY. But one must feel to a certain extent implicated by the doings of one's relatives. Suppose you had a near relatiATe Avho had committed a murder, you could not help feeling to some extent disgraced.' ' That just depends on how far one is able to shake off the fetters of the artificial social system in Avhich we are brought up. If I have, eA-en indirectly, contributed to bring about the circum stances which have led to a relative of mine committing a murder, then I admit a share of the disgrace rightly falls on me. OtherAvise I decline to consider myself in any way implicated. Faith, one has sins enough of one's own to answer for, without being smirched with those of other people.' Isabel was silent. There seemed to her a certain emphasis about her father's remarks. Three months earlier, perhaps, no such thought would have occurred to her, but since then she had come to learn that there were some chapters in her father's history not so wholly creditable to him as his orderly life in London. Did he dread that incidents Avhich she would hold discreditable might come to her knoAvledge, and wish, to some extent,"], [365, "DUNCAN MORAY. 357 to mould her sentiments beforehand ? She almost fancied that he was furtively watching her, but he had seated himself near the fire, with his back to the lamp, and he was holding a newspaper so as to screen his eyes from the flickering light of the briskly burning flames in the grate, and she could not see his face very distinctly. He drank the tea she gave him, in silence, and then asked her to read an article in the papers to him. She had nearly finished it, and the clock Avas on the stroke of eleven, when she heard the door of the passage open abruptly, and hasty steps approaching. She paused involuntarily, just in time to see the door open, and catch a glimpse of Marion Boswell, as she was almost roughly thrust aside by Duncan Moray, Avho entered the room, pale and agitated. ' I beg yer pardon for this intrusion, Miss Elliott,' he said. ' Has my father been wi' ye the night, Mr. Elliott ? ' ' Your father,' repeated Mr. Elliott, in a someAvhat bewildered tone. ' It is Mr. Duncan Moray, father,' Isabel explained."], [366, "DUNCAN MORAY. 358 ' Oh, I understand. No, Mr. Moray, he has not been here. I expected him, but he did not come.' ' Then something has gane wrang.' ' What is it ? What has happened ? ' asked Isabel, catching her breath. She had started up on Duncan's entrance, and was standing nearly as pale as himself, grasping the back of a chair. ' I canna tell. I was na hame till nigh on nine o'clock the night. Then I found my father had started for Beechwood a little before eight o'clock. I walked doAvn to the bridge to meet him, but he has na been seen.' ' The river,' gasped Isabel, thinking of the narroAv bridge, railed only on one side. ' No, he did na gang by the fields. He went by Rossan to post a letter.' ' What is it that you fear, Mr. Moray ? ' asked Mr. Elliott, anxiously. He had risen from his seat, and came forward, as he spoke, to Avhere his daughter and visitor were standing. ' You know your father is a total stranger to me. Is there any cause for uneasiness ? The business was not of instant moment. May not Mr. Moray have"], [367, "DUNCAN MORAY. 359 changed his mind, and gone somewhere else instead ? ' ' My father wad never fail to keep an appoint ment. There has been an accident, or something worse.' 'Good heavens! I trust not. What could happen ? It is not a very dark night.' ' I canna tell ; but something is wrang. I manna stay idling here.' ' There is only Peter at hand. I fear I cannot be of much use,' said Mr. Elliott. 'What can I do, Mr. Moray?' asked Isabel, Avhite and trembling, but quite collected. ' If ye're no feared to gang to the forge, Miss Elliott, ye might knock up the HoAviesons. A' the sons are at hame just noo. An' ye might ask at the lodge. Auld Nannie Avad likely see my father pass.' ' Do not stop at the lodge, Isabel,' her father said.

In a feAv moments Isabel Elliott was running"], [368, "DUNCAN MORAY. 360 down the drive, on .her way to the forge, which stood by the road side, at about a quarter of a mile's distance from the lodge. An accident, or something worse ! The words kept sounding in her ears. What could Duncan Moray mean ? It was hard to think of any accident which could have befallen his father, save such a one as would have been instantly known ; but ' worse ' \u2014 what, beyond accident, could possibly threaten the old man ? Surely his son's fears were exaggerated !

Very soon a Avindow Avas thrown open, and a man's voice demanded : 'Wha'sthat?' ' It is Miss Elliott. Old Mr. Moray is missing.

We'll be up directly, Miss Elliott.'"], [369, "DUNCAN MORAY. 361 Isabel turned her steps homeward. Glancing back from a short distance she saw that lights were flashing from every Avindow in the cottage, and she had not gone much further ere she caught the sound of flying footsteps, and a bare-headed, bare-footed boy, clad only in shirt and trousers, went by her like a streak, in the direction of Rossan. Old Nannie was standing at the lodge gates. ' Eh, Miss Elliott, but this is a sair piece o' wark.' ' Has anything been heard of him ? ' ' Naething as yet.' ' Had you seen him ?

Half way up the drive, Isabel overtook her father, returning slowly towards the house.
