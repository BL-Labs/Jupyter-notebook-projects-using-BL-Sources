The actual state and the probable future prospects of our country, resemble those of no other land, and are without a parallel in past history. Our immense extent of fertile territory opening an inexhaustible field for successful enterprise, thus assuring to indus try a certain reward for its labors, and preserving the land, for centuries to come, from the manifold evils of an overcrowded, and consequently degraded popula tion \u2014 our magnificent system of federated republics, carrying out and applying the principles of represen tative democracy to an extent never hoped or ima gined in the boldest theories of the old speculative republican philosophers, the Harringtons, Sydneys and Lockes of former times \u2014 the re-action of our po litical system upon our social and domestic concerns, bringing the influence of popular feeling and public opinion to bear upon all the affairs of life in a degree hitherto wholly unprecedented \u2014 the unconstrained"], [14, "6 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF range of freedom of opinion, of speech, and of the press, and the habitual and daring exercise of that liberty upon the highest subjects \u2014 the absence of all serious inequality of fortune and rank in the condi tion of our citizens \u2014 our divisions into innumerable religious sects, and the consequent co-existence, never before regarded as possible, of intense religious zeal, with a great degree of toleration in feeling and per fect equality of rights \u2014 our intimate connexion with that elder world beyond the Atlantic, communicating to us, through the press and emigration, much of good and much of evil not our own, high science, refined art, and the best knowledge of old experience, as well as prejudices and luxuries, vices and crimes, such as could not have been expected to spring up in our soil for ages \u2014 all these, combined with nume rous other peculiarities in the institutions and in the moral, civil and social condition of the American peo ple, have given to our society, through all its rela tions, a character exclusively its own, peculiar and unexampled. Circumstances and causes such as these, wide, general and incessantly operative, thus pervading the whole mass of the community, cannot fail, in some way or other, to reach and powerfully affect every in dividual. Any American citizen who will look about him with an attentive eye, and then turn his con-"], [15, "7 THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. templation inward upon himself, and examine his own breast and his own life, will readily perceive how sovereignly some or other of these external causes control his fortunes, direct his destinies, and mould his habits and his conduct, swaying or guiding his tastes, his reason, his feelings, or his affections. But if these can thus reach the humblest citizen, how much more decided must be their effect upon the man of native talent and improved intellect ! As his mind expands itself more largely on the surface of society, as it enters with a bolder ambition or a keener relish into the concerns of men, the pursuits of fame, of power, or of knowledge, just so in propor tion must he sympathize more readily with the sur rounding world, and in acting upon many, must feel more sensibly the reciprocal action of the greater mass upon himself. Hence, all that is singular and peculiar in our country, her people or her institu tions, will be in some sort imaged in his mind, and will operate upon his mental constitution as silently but as certainly as his physical frame is affected by the food that sustains him, or the air that he breathes. It is, therefore, gentlemen, that I have thought that I could not more usefully discharge the duty as signed to me by your kind partiality, or select a theme more appropriate to the annual academic celebration of a college, which already boasting among its"], [16, "8 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF alumni so large a proportion of the active talent of our state, continues annually to swell that number by a numerous body of our most promising youth, than to call your attention to the consideration of the bless ings and advantages resulting from the political and social condition of our republic, to the Ameri can scholar \u2014 not merely in common to him with the rest of his fellow-citizens, but to him especially and above others, as an educated and intellectual man. These are blessings and advantages, in them selves peculiar, unrivalled, inestimable ; still, like all other temporal goods, they are not unmixed with evil, not unaccompanied by dangers, always liable to abuse. Like, too, to the other gifts of the Most High, intrusted to man for the use of his fellow men, they impose upon their possessor weighty, solemn and holy duties. It is then of these blessings and advantages of the American scholar, their accompanying dangers and their attendant duties, that I now purpose to speak to you. The subject ought certainly to interest those whom I am called to address, for it is of themselves that I must speak. From the lips of wisdom and genius, the theme could not fail to be fruitful of the deepest and most precious instruction. For myself, and the very imperfect views I am about to"], [17, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 9 lay before you, I can claim no other weight or autho rity, than what may arise from the fact, that these are neither the vague speculations of a politi cal theorist, nor the rant of patriotic declamation. They are sober and deliberate opinions, the results of much opportunity of observation, and that by no means careless or hasty, and formed by one not in different to the imperfections of our political or social system, or unwdling to confess them \u2014 not blind to the faults and errors of his country or his countrymen, but who has yet never wavered or faltered in his veneration for the sacred cause of republican liberty, or in his confidence of the ultimate and certain ten dency of our free institutions to promote truth and justice, to diffuse happiness and virtue. First of all then \u2014 We all know and feel that every thing in the condition and prospects of our country tends to excite and maintain a bold and stirring acti vity of thought and action throughout the whole community. Nothing is allowed to remain stagnant or dormant. Every mind is compelled, sometimes in despite of its own inclinations, to partake of the buoyant spirit, the restless mobility, the irrepressible energy of youth and hope. In most other lands society moves with steady regularity, in one slow, sure and accustomed round. Each ascending step in the scale of wealth and dis- 2"], [18, "10 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF tinction is completely filled up, and the vast majority, doomed to hereditary ignorance and privation, must be content to pass their whole lives where birth or accident has first placed them. Feeling no stimulus to exertion, besides that of daily want, their desires and their hopes conform themselves to the narrow scale of their regular toils and their humble enjoyments. But with us, commerce, arts, agriculture, enterprise, adventure, ambition, are crowding and hurrying every man forward. Our past is but brief. We can scarcely be said to have a present \u2014 certainly we have none for mere indolent enjoyment. We are all pressing and hastening forward to some better future. No single mind can well resist the general impulse. The momentum of the whole mass of society, com posed of myriads of living forces, is upon each indi vidual, and he flies forward with accelerated velo city, without any other power over his own motion than that of the direction of its course. The univer sal ardor is contagious, and we all rush into the throng of life, and are swept along by its broad, re sistless current. Least of all can the mind, formed to liberal stu dies, habituated from early youth to the employment of its most vigorous faculties, resist the wide spread sympathy. \"The clear spirit,\" to use Milton's phrase, \" nursed up with brighter influences and with"], [19, "11 THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. a soul enlarged to the dimensions of spacious and high knowledge,\" sees in every direction careers of honor, or of usefulness open to its exertions, and tasking its noblest powers. For with us talent can not well slumber ; knowledge may always find some fit application. Travel elsewhere, and where is it that you may not find talent chilled and withered by penury, or pro found learning wasted on the drudgery of elementa ry instruction, or else \" lost in a convent's solitary gloom ?\" With us this need never be. In fact, it is seldom long so, unless from the positive fault of the possessor. Excepting those melancholy cases, where some unavoidable calamity has weighed down the spirits and extinguished joy and hope for ever, knowledge and ability cannot well run here to waste without their voluntary degradation by gross vice or the maddest imprudence. But I do not now speak of the varied opportunities for the suc cessful exertion of matured, cultivated talent, or the substantial rewards that its exercise may win, so much as of the still greater advantage which that talent may derive to itself from the prevailing activity and energy that animate the whole commu nity. Under that strong and contagious stimulus' the faculties are awakened, the capacity enlarged, the genius roused, excited, inspired. The mind is"], [20, "12 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF not suffered to brood undisturbed over its own little stock of favorite thoughts, treading the same un ceasing round of habitual associations, until it be comes quite incapable of fixing its attention upon any new object, and its whole existence is but a dull, drowsy dream. On the contrary, it is forced to sympathize with the living world around, to enter into the concerns of others and of the public, and to partake, more or less, of the cares and the hopes of men. Thus every hour it imbibes, unconsciously, new and strange knowledge, quite out of the sphere of its own personal experience. Thus it receives, and in its turn spontaneously communicates that bright electric current that darts its rapid course throughout our whole body politic, removing every sluggish obstruction, and bracing every languid muscle to vigorous toil. As compared with the more torpid state of society exhibited elsewhere, to live in one such as this, is like emerging from the fogs of the lowland fens heavy with chilling pes^ tilence, \u25a0the dull pacific air Where mountain zephyr never blew, The marshy level dank and bare, That Pan, that Ceres never knew \u2014 \" and ascending to inhale the exhilarating mountain atmosphere, where the breeze is keen and pure, and"], [21, "13 THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. the springs gush bright from their native rock, be stowing on the children of the hills the bounding step, the strong arm, the far seeing eye, and the stout heart. It is much then to breathe such a mental air from earliest youth. It is much to be edu cated and formed under such potent and perpetual stimulants to intellectual development. But for a mind thus formed and framed for vigorous and effective action, it is not less necessaiy that fitting occupations may be found for its nobler qualities and powers. This is much for worldly success. It is every thing for honor, for conscience, for content, for beneficence. Let genius, however brilliant, how ever gifted with rare, or copious, or varied acquire ments, be but doomed to labor for selfish objects, for personal necessities and sensual gratifications, and for those only \u2014 and its aspirations too will become low, its desires sordid, and its powers (adroit, doubtless, and very effective as to their accustomed occupa tions) will dwindle and become enfeebled, until they are quite incapable of any generous and magnani mous undertaking. But with us the man of intellectual endowment is not so \" cabined, cribbed, bound in\" to his own puny cares. Far otherwise ; his generous ambition, his large philanthrophy, his zeal for the service of his God or his country, may spread themselves abroad"], [22, "14 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF \" as wide and general as the casing air,\" without finding any check or barrier to their farthest range. In the eternal order of Providence, minds act and re-act, and become the transcripts and reflections of each other, thus multiplying and perpetuating the evils or the excellence of our short being upon this globe. It is not the exclusive prerogative of the great, the eloquent, the chosen sons of genius or of power, who can speak trumpet-tongued to millions of their fellow creatures from the high summits of fame or authority, thus to be able to extend themselves in the production of good or evil far around and forward. We are all of us, in some sort, as waves in the shoreless ocean of human existence. Our own petty agitations soon die away, but they can extend themselves far onward and onward, and there are oftentimes circumstances which may cause those billows to swell as they roll forward, until they rise into a majestic vastness which it could scarce seem possible that our puny efforts could have ever set in motion. Such favoring circumstances, in other na tions comparatively rare, are here the common bless ings of our land. We have a population doubling and re-doubling with a steady velocity so unexam pled in former history, as to have utterly confounded the speculations of all older political philosophy. We have a territory, which rapidly as that popula-"], [23, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 15 tion subdues the forest and covers the desert, has still ample room for coming generations. These things alone are enormous elements in the mighty process of social melioration. Whatever is effected in removing any of the evils that afflict those about us, must, ere long, reach far beyond us and beyond them, to other and more numerous generations, to distant fields, as yet silent and desolate, but destined soon to swarm with a busy multitude. The charac ter, knowledge and happiness of that future and dis tant multitude, are now in our hands. They are to be moulded by our beneficent labors, our example, our studies, our philanthropic enterprise. Thus the \" spirit of our deeds,\" long after those deeds have passed away, will continue to walk the earth, from one ocean-beat shore of our continent to the other, scattering blessings or curses upon after-times. Consider too the general elementary instruction of this nation \u2014 too slight, meagre and superficial in deed to content the patriot as an ultimate end where with to rest satisfied, but admirable as the means of spreading information and pouring a bright flood of light and truth over our whole continent. Books, newspapers, periodicals, are scattered profusely through the land, and present to a large proportion of our population their favorite and most unfailing relaxation from business and toil. Our people are"], [24, "16 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF daily, hourly habituated to discussions of the most interesting nature, sometimes upon the most ab struse, frequently upon the most important sub jects of human interest. All our experience, our modes of business and ways of life, have a strong tendency to teach us to regard science, not as a thing mysterious and solitary, never to be mixed with common life and its ordinary thoughts and concerns, but as an exalted and munificent benefactor, con stantly and profusely contributing to our Welfare and happiness. Hence it requires nothing but the steady and well-directed efforts of enlightened and liberal minds to make a very large part, and that in many respects too, the best part of science, familiar and popular to a degree which the recluse scholar of former days could never imagine. Much indeed of the best science can only be useful, in any high degree, by becoming thus familiar and popular ; for unless it be so, it must remain a barren theory, dry and useless. This is eminently and self-evidently true in all political and economical science. It is equally so of all ethical truth : and as it is the beautiful charac teristic of the loftiest and most perfect science, most rapidly to simplify and generalize its knowledge as it increases its stores, it is not easy to conjecture any assignable limit beyond which the grand conclusions"], [25, "17 THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. (at least) of sound scientific investigation, and the results of learned labor, may not be laid open to the liberal curiosity of the humblest artisan. In the same or some similar way, the choicest refinements of classical taste, and the congenial study of the remains of ancient genius, which beautify and enrich the scholar's mind, may be made through him to enlarge, to elevate* and ennoble the general mind of his country. But these are not the only facilities we enjoy for making the acquisitions of learning profitable to all, and for bringing intellectual force to bear upon its appropriate objects. The quick and keen sense of self-interest, that gives such sagacity and energy to the business operations of this country, is equally propitious to the success of every art, every discovery, invention, undertaking, and science, that involves in it any amount of practical improvement or power. Hence, whatever of theoretical science, inventive skill, ingenious speculation, or reasoning eloquence, can be made to tell upon any of the multitudinous affairs making up the business of life, or to minister in any way to the increased power or enjoyment of man, will soon find ready attentiou for their claims. Here no prejudices in favor of time-honored usages are strong enough long to resist the advance of scien tific improvement or wise innovation. Society is not 3"], [26, "18 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF divided into castes, each one of them watching with jealous vigilance against any encroachment of their several exclusive walks by any rude intruder from another class, themselves clinging to the settled usages and old forms of their own clan, with the steady pertinacity of men whose unexamined preju dices are interwoven with their earliest habits and their most valuable personal interests. If Science, descending from her starry throne in the heavens, light the student to any discovery or invention in any manner applicable to the wants of his fellow creatures \u2014 if Genius prompts the lofty thought \u2014 if love of God or of man inspire the generous design, no matter how the novelty may astonish for the moment, no matter what prejudices may be shocked, no matter what interests may be alarmed and band themselves against the innovator, let him go on un dismayed. He advances to certain victory. But it has often been objected that this all-absorb ing gravitation towards the useful, the active, and the practical, in our country, propels every student from his most favorite studies into the struggles, the com petition, and tumult of life, and is thus fatal at once to all recondite and curious learning, to deep attain ment in pure science or polished excellence in elegant art and literature. There is certainly some portion of truth in this objection, and yet but a por-"], [27, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 19 tion only. Where the demands for competent ability are so pressing, and the temptations to em- ploy that ability in such occupations as bring with them instant rewards are so great, it is quite certain that but few will be found inclined to spend their lives in studies which have no interest for others, and no perceptible bearing on private or public good. When, however, we consider the wonderful connexion and inter -dependance of all knowledge, made more and more manifest by every day's advance in science, so as almost to prove by an accumulation of particular exdmples the sublime hypothesis of the old philosophy, \" that by circuit of deduction, all truth out of any truth may be concluded ;\" when we reflect how singularly adapted the various parts of knowledge are to the individual tastes and character of different men, so as to seize and draw them as with an irresistible mental magnetism to their several studies, we cannot, I think, doubt that all that is most valuable in science or literature, will find votaries among us, who. not content to make such studies the amusements of their leisure or to devote a life of monastic gloom to their solitary worship, will make or find for them a fit application. The experience of scientific investigation has shown that such applica tion of the test of reality and experiment to theoretic truth, has not only often thrown a clearer light on that"], [28, "20 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF theory, at once limiting its generalities and confirm ing its evidence, but has also evolved new com binations, suggested new inferences, and mani fested higher laws. Art more than repays its obligations to science. The large processes of manufactures have proved the best school of che mical discovery. Natural knowledge has contri buted largely to medical skill, and it has in turn received its most precious accessions from the obser vation of the physician. The abstrusest speculations of the metaphysician, have found their place in those controversies of theologians that rend the religious world, as well as in questions of political discussion, of legislation, and of jurisprudence. Thus contem plations, apparently the most shadowy, have often operated with the greatest efficiency upon the most engrossing concerns of daily life. Nevertheless, it may well be that there are some meditations so subtile and unreal, some branches of learning so remote from use, some laborious arts of refinement requiring for their successful cultiva tion such silent abstraction and unremitting, undi vided labor for years, that they can find no room amid the strife and bustle, the fumurn, strepitumqae, \u2014 the rail-road noise and rapidity of this work-day world of America. Be it so. We would not willingly lose them. For nothing that has filled the thoughts of"], [29, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 21 the good and wise, or weaned men from sensual pleasure by the better attractions of art, taste or learning, can be without value and dignity. But if we must lose them, let us be content, and the more so, because their deprivation, if such be of necessity the case, is more than compensated by countervailing benefits resulting from the same causes. Such acquirements or accomplishments cannot flourish here, because they require the devo tion of the whole man to their service, whilst the American man of letters is incessantly called off from any single inquiry, and allured or compelled to try his ability in every variety of human occu pation. Though he may be laboriously devoted to the duties of a particular calling, or, on the other hand, exempted from the pressure of regular professional labor, no man of informed mind can with us exclude the surrounding world. The Quidquid agunt homines, familiarity with men and their business is forced upon him, and it is a rare thing indeed if he can remain a cool looker-on. It may be patriotism, it may be humanity, that animates him \u2014 it may be personal pride, or political zeal, or ambition, or per haps merely the mysterious sympathy of universal example ; but whatever may be the special motive in the individual, no scholar, no professional student"], [30, "22 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF or practitioner can well remain the mere man of books. If in this acquaintance with many other matters, something is lost as to particular skill and minute accuracy of knowledge, assuredly much more is gained in the healthful development of the facul ties, the enlargement of the understanding, the more equable poise of the judgment, and the richness, variety, and originality of the materials for reflection, combination, or invention thus stored in the memoiy. If awed by that veneration the scholar naturally feels for those who consecrate their days and nights to learning, alternating only between books and the pen, you hesitate to allow the superiority conferred by this variety and versatility over the man of one solitary study, let me appeal to the unvarying testi mony of literary history for the proof. The great men of antiquity, the models of eloquence, the fathers of poetry, the teachers of ethical wisdom, the founders of that ancient jurisprudence, that still rules the greater part of the civilized world, were none of them solitary scholars ; none of them were contented with the \" half wisdom of books\" alone. They performed well all the duties of war and peace ; and their immortal works, beautiful in the severe simplicity of truth and nature, still remain \"eternal monuments\" \u2014 as Thucydides, in the calm consciousness of genius, has said of his own"], [31, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 23 majestic history \u2014 eternal monuments for the good of after ages, of things which they had themselves seen and done. There was scarce one of them who could not, like Cicero, look back, with proud satisfaction, to his labors in the forum, the senate, and the field, disastrous ofttimes, but full of glory \u2014 \" summi labores nostri, magna compensati gloria, mitigantur* and then turn to those studies which were the grace and crown of their prosperity, and the sure consolation of their misfortunes, \" non modo sedatis molestiis jucunda, sed etiam h\u0153rentilms salutaria.\" The self-same lesson is taught in the history of the philosophy and literature of our own mother tongue. Whose are the venerated and enduring names \u2014 whose the volumes that we turn to, with reverent affection, as the oracles of just thought, or the ever fresh springing fountains of delight 1 Who were they from Bacon to our own Franklin \u2014 from Spenser and Shakspeare to Walter Scott, but men of those mixed pursuits, that multifarious instruction, that familiar intercourse with actual life, which narrow minded learning would brand as the bane of philo sophy, the destruction of letters. Compare their works with those of men devoted to literature alone, \u2022 De Oratore, Lib. II."], [32, "24 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF and who looked at nothing beyond its precincts \u2014 the plodding compiler, the laborious collector of scien tific trifles, valuable only as materials for some wiser mind to use, the herd of dealers in light literature, either the servile imitators of past excellence, or the echoes of the follies of their day, or baser yet, the pandars to its vices. How short and fleeting has been their popularity ! Here and there one among the num ber has deserved the gratitude of posterity by moral worth and well directed labor. His works keep an honored place in our libraries, but they rarely exer cise a living sway over the opinions and tastes of nations. A mortal born he meets the general doom, But leaves, \"like Egypt's kings, a lasting tomb. Such is also the experience of the arts of taste and design. The father of the Italian arts, Leonardo da Vinci, was a scholar, a politician, a poet, a musician. Michael Angelo, the sublime and the holy, was still more universal. Sculptor, painter, poet, architect, engineer \u2014 we find him now painting his grand frescos, now modelling his gigantic statues, now heaving the dome of St. Peter's into the air, and now fortifying his loved Florence, the city of his affections, with a humble diligence and a pa triot's zeal. There are no such artists now in Italy. The painters and sculptors with which it swarms,"], [33, "25 THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. are devoted to painting and sculpture exclusively; but how do they compare as artists with their great predecessors 1 Could any authority whatever add weight to the facts I have just referred to, such would be found in the opinion of Milton himself. In a well known passage of one of those fervid and brilliant prose tracts of his youth, which (to use the noble metaphor of an eloquent critic) announced the Paradise Lost as plainly as ever the bright purple clouds in the east announced the rising of the sun ; Milton, with a sublime and determined confidence in his own genius, covenanted \u2014 for that is his remarka ble expression \u2014 in some few years thereafter, to produce \" a work not to be raised from the heats of youth or the vapors of wine, like that which flows at will from the pen of some vulgar amorist, nor by invocation of Memory and her syren sisters, but by devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit which can enrich with all utterance and knowledge, and send out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his altar to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases.\" \" To this,\" he subjoins in a lower strain of eloquence, but with the same decision of tone \u2014 \" to this must be added industrious and select readings, steady observation, and an insight into all seemly and generous arts and affairs.\" Had Milton confined himself to the studies of his library, or the halls of his university \u2014 had he not 4"], [34, "26 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF thrown himself into the hottest conflicts of the day \u2014 had he not stood forth the terrible champion of free dom of opinion and of republican liberty, raising on high his spirit-stirring voice in their defence in worst extremes, and \" on the perilous verge of battle where it raged ;\" had he not participated in counsel, in act, and in suffering with England's boldest spirits \u2014 had he not thus felt in himself, and seen in others, the \" might of the unconquerable will,\" the unshaken, unseduced, unterrified constancy of faithful zeal and love, he would not have gained that insight into seemly and generous arts and affairs, that intimate acquaintance with the nobler parts of human nature that made him the greatest of poets. Had Milton lived always a recluse student, his learned fancy would undoubtedly have enriched his country's litera ture with Lycidas and Comus, but the world would have wanted the Paradise Lost. But the American literary man has yet other rea sons to be grateful for having been born in this age and country ; and they are reasons such as a mind cast in the grand antique mould of Milton's, would prize as most worthy of fervent thanksgiving. Every thing here is propitious to honest independence of thought. Such an independence is the presiding genius of all our institutions ; it is the vital spirit that gives life to the whole. Without this, our con-"], [35, "27 THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. stitutions and laws, our external forms of equality, our elections, our representation, our boasted liberty of speech and of conscience, are but poor and beg garly elements, shadows without substance, dead and worthless carcasses, from which the living soul, the grace, the glory, the strength, have for ever fled. It is not the parchment record of our constitutions, the bills of right, the trial by jury, the elective fran chise, nor all the securities provided by the jealous wisdom of our fathers for the unrestrained exercise of liberty, that can call back this living spirit when once it has fled \u2014 no, nor the unrestrained press scat tering its millions of daily sheets over the land, nor the representative halls echoing with their never ending discussions. These cannot repair its loss, but they are all admirable agents in its production and preservation ; and there are besides other circum stances in our condition not less favorable to this tem per, than our political institutions. The numberless shades of opinions upon the doctrines of revelation, as well as upon other momentous concerns and du ties, coming to us from the various stocks whence we descend, or the different influences under which our citizens grow up, with all the creeds, all the preju dices, and all the knowledge of the old world pour ing in upon them, though involving or producing dangerous errors, have yet a healthful efficacy in"], [36, "28 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF habituating men to the free use of their judgment, and the manly, direct avowal of their thoughts. Here there is no apparently general agreement of society to awe the mind from investigation of what claims to be certain and established truth. And when examination on any subject brings con viction, the inquirer is seldom compelled to meet that hardest trial of human fortitude, the renuncia tion of old associations and long cherished doctrines in the face of universal scorn and indignation, and without the solace of human sympathy. More than this : \u2014 that restlessness of enterprise, which alike nerves the frontier settler to the toils and ad ventures of the wilderness, and kindles the young dreams of the political aspirant, which whitens the ocean with our canvass, drives the rail-road through the desert, and startles the moose at his watering place, or scares the eagle from his high solitary perch with the sudden beat of the steam-boat's wheels \u2014 that one and the same ardent, restless spirit ruling our whole people, can have little commu nion with that abject prostration of intellect, that makes man crouch before his fellow, submitting his reason and his conscience to another's will.

Here"], [37, "29 THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. are at once provided facilities for the propagation of truth, and securities for some portion, at least, of respect for conscientious error. It is not easy to realize the full value of the bless ings made familiar to us by daily enjoyment, without some experience of their opposite evils. It is our happy fate to know nothing personally of the severer tyranny of power over the conscience. History can alone teach us what this is, and how to estimate duly our political advantages in this respect. What then is the history of human opinions but a long record of martyrdom for truth, for religion, for pri vate conscience, for public liberty I Every monu ment of antiquity in the old world, like that one of \" London's lasting shame,\" The Traitor's Gate, miscalled, through which of yore Past Raleigh, Cranmer, Russel, Sydney, More,\u2014* every vestige of the past recalls some remembrance of the \" lifted axe, the agonizing wheel,\" the scaffold, the stake, and the fagot, on which the patriot poured out his life's blood, and where the martyr breathed forth in torture his last prayer of triumphant for giving faith.

I do not count as the least among these the absence of marked difference of hereditary or permanent rank. It is impossible for any one, who has not personally witnessed it, to comprehend the strange reverence to worse and infe rior men than themselves, the submisson of the un derstanding to the vices and caprices of those they deem the higher orders, which beginning with early youth, and confirmed by education, clings throughout life to thousands of the well-instructed and the good. I well remember the astonishment expressed to me, some years ago, by several learned and respectable ministers of the gospel in Great Britain, at the ease"], [40, "THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF 32 with which an eloquent divine of our country (the late Dr. Mason) conversed and argued with, and even contradicted, a royal duke who had honored an anniversary charity festival with his presence. They accounted for this phenomenon not by ascribing it to its right cause, the temper and education of his country, but by attributing it to his presumed habits of familiar association with the political dignitaries of his own land. This feeling struck me as the more remarkable, because these worthy men (several of whom enjoy an honorable distinction in the religious literary world) were themselves dissenters from the national established church, and almost republican opposers of the then administration of the state. It requires a very strong effort of mind, and often too as great an excitement of feeling, to throw of this prejudice ; and when it is thus thrown off, the danger is that it either runs into wild insubordination of just authority, or else lasts but for a time, till the fervor of youthful zeal is over, and the suggestions of inte rested prudence concur with early opinions ; and then the half obliterated impressions of youth re appear. Now the obvious tendency of all this is to bow down the intellect before authority, making the soul crouch and crawl before place, rank and dig nity. I say that such is its tendency \u2014 for I should"], [41, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 33 do foul wrong and insult to the deep serious thought of England and her native sturdy manliness, as well as to the enthusiastic intellectual daring of the con tinental scholars, were I to say that such were the constant and necessary consequences of any exter nal and artificial condition of social order whatso ever \u2014 still less so of a mixed government like theirs. It is, however, an influence deeply deleterious to the right feeling of mental independence, and it is there fore happy that it in no degree threatens us. But in other lands, pecuniary dependance is too often connected with this reverence for rank, so that they produce together the most complete vassalage. The market for intellectual labor is overstocked. Nature's rich banquet is crowded with titled and hereditary guests, \" the table is full.\" To emerge from the crowd of menials, and obtain some share of the feast, the unbidden scholar must attach him self to the train of a patron, and feed on the alms his niggard bounty may bestow. Such has been the degrading history of literary men, poets, au thors, and, I blush to add, philosophers, through out the world, for many centuries. And if in our own times the literature of France and of England have, in a good degree, freed themselves from that ignoble thraldom, this is mainly to be attributed to the growth of principles similar to our own, to the 5"], [42, "34 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF diffusion of knowledge amongst the people, to the rapid increase of commercial and manufacturing riches, all combining to build up the sovereignty of public opinion, and to make the patronage of aristo cratic wealth more and more insignificant in compa rison with the unpretending munificence of an edu cated people. Yet the causes which originally led to this degradation of the literary character remain, and much of the best talent of Europe still wears (as nearly the whole of it did for centuries) the galling though gilded chain of patronage. Yet think what ills the scholar's life assail, Toil, envy, want, the patron and the gaol, \u2014 said the indignant Johnson, filled as he was with habitual reverence for rank, yet resenting, with manly contempt, the wrongs of genius and the disgrace of letters. At a later period of his life, the same veteran au thor recorded in his great English Dictionary the bit ter result of his long and sad experience and that of his literary associates, by sarcastically defining thepa tron as being \" commonly a wretch, who protects with insolence and is paid by flattery.\" The same sad story is told more in detail in the precarious depend ant lives of the wits and poets of London and Paris during the reigns of Louis XIV., Charles II., and the"], [43, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 35 first and second Georges.

The facility with which a sure and comfortable subsistence may be obtained in this country, and the certainty with which educa- ted talent, directed by ordinary discretion and indus- try, may obtain to a decent competency, are such as to exclude all temptation, much more all necessity, to follow in this respect the humiliating example of European learning. To such evils \"the lack of means need never drive us.\" If dazzled by the false glitter of office, if bribed by the doles of political patronage, or by such paltry boons as private inte- rest can bestow, the American scholar is ever weak enough to sell his conscience, or bow down his independence before a master, he falls a volun- tary victim. The sin is his own \u2014 his own be the shame. Let him not seek to divide it with his country.

Yet the lure to evil from serving the many is far less than from serving the few. To one entire half of the great domain of mind it reaches not at all. The cultivator of mathematical and physical science, more fortunate in this than the man of letters, is wholly beyond such danger. All of his labors, in order to bring honor or advantage to himself, must be felt in the increased comforts of thousands, or the augmented power of his species. What a magnificent accompaniment is this thought to the other worldly rewards of his successful toils ! What a moral dignity does it give to the exploits of art and science, in themselves the most purely physical and mechanical !

In order to touch the universal natural sensibilities, he must stir up the generous sympathies, that in individuals are entan gled or choked with their peculiar vices, but still are common to human nature. He must rouse up the virtues that sleep in most hearts, but are dead in none. So only can he gain and keep a firm hold upon the public mind. Now in the very effort of so doing, his own littleness is insensibly lost in the greatness of a common humanity. He tasks himself to high purposes, and in that exertion brings forth powers he dreamt not of in himself. The author rises above the man. He becomes unto himself, his own \" exceeding great reward.\" I was much struck, years ago, with an admirable application made by a veteran statesman of this general truth to a sound doctrine of political ethics. It is contained in that beautiful historical fragment left by the late Charles Fox \u2014 a work that, I know not why, has never obtained that reputation of which it seems to me to be eminently worthy.

How little do they appear in one instance ! how great in the other ! And the investigation of the cause to which this excessive difference is owing, will produce a most useful lesson.

But I do not hesi tate to give the doctrine a much wider application, and to say that a state of society, free and popular, is eminently conducive to exalted principles of thought and action, and the best energies of intel lectual men in every liberal and generous pursuit, and is therefore desirable to them, not only for the public welfare, \"but for their own greatness and consideration, for every object of generous ambi tion.\" In such a state, Poetry and Painting may perhaps look around in vain for Macenases.

To them I must hurry, and I can speak of them but briefly. It is of the intellectual dangers, growing out of circumstances otherwise thus fruitful in blessings, that I purposed also to speak. The dangers of prosperity, more insidious than those of adversity, are often more fatal, and these are of that class. One of the most obvious of them, is the danger of falling into a conceited, smattering superficiality in consequence of that very universality of occupa tion and inquiry which seems, in other respects, so propitious to the formation of a sound, comprehen sive understanding, so useful to the man of books, so graceful to the man of business. Such superfi ciality is undeniably one of the besetting sins of our reading men. It shows itself in the capacity of talking fluently upon all things, and of doing eveiy thing ; and in the habit of talking inaccurately upon all things, and of doing every thing badly. It nourishes and sustains itself upon compends, abridg- 6"], [50, "\u25a012 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF ments, extracts, and all the other convenient subsidia of improved education ; excellent things in their way, but like other great improvements of our day, wheel ing you to the object of your journey, without per mitting you to know much of the country you pass through.

His understanding will be tempered by use to that right medium that best brings the scattered and broken rays of light from all quarters, to con verge upon any object on which the mind is called to fix its attention. This impatience of continuous systematic labor, and the hope of reaching by some new and short road those objects of human desire which the Creator has not less beneficently than wisely de creed, should be gained only by the sweat of the brow or the toil of the mind \u2014 Pater ipse colendi Haud facilem esse viam voluit, \u2014 this same impatience of slow study that engenders the parading superficiality which I have just describ ed, is often seen to produce still more serious effects upon the character and the whole course of life. Such effects are peculiarly apparent at the present time in our own country. In the wonderful and accelerated progress of this nation to wealth and greatness, the public mind is con tinually surprised by the sudden apparition of enor mous riches gained as it were in a moment, some times seemingly by accident, sometimes the hasty fruit of a quick-eyed and bold sagacity. Then again in our political contentions, the unexpected mutation of po pular favor frequently raises an individual at once to"], [52, "44 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF eminence from some humble professional walk, where he leaves his former superiors to toil on far beneath him. Under the strong excitements of such exam ples, it is but natural that the ardent youth of ac quirement and ability should be often tempted to look with disgust upon the slow returns of regular labor, whether in study or in business. He closes his books, or he flies from his office or counting-room, and rushes to the field of gambling speculation, or it may be of equally gambling politics, trusting to become immediately rich or great, by the favor of fortune, as others have become before him. Unquestionably in such a republic as ours, the rewards of public favor are legitimate objects of honorable ambition. So too in a country where population and capital are so rapidly augmenting, to neglect the means of securing to ourselves some share of that general prosperity, which long-sighted sagacity assures us must be the natural effect of causes already in action, would be to reject the goods which Providence tenders to our acceptance. But the great danger in this country, and especially at the present time, and peculiarly to the well-educa ted young man, is that he is most strongly tempted to stake at once his whole chance of success and of hap piness upon such uncertain contingencies and upon them alone ; turning with scorn from the sober"], [53, "45 THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. certainties of life, as being worthy the attention of none but dull, plodding spirits. Now viewing this subject as a mere question of prudent calculation, we are met with the striking and certain fact, that the whole aggregate profits of mere speculative gain among us (throwing aside all account of the perhaps equal losses) are utterly insig nificant in comparison with those of regular com merce, or well directed industry in other pursuits. In the same way, and for precisely the same reasons, the highest honors and rewards of the mere political adventurer are just as paltry, when placed by the side of those of Marshall, and Wirt, and Dwight, of Wistar, or of White, and, I might add, many living names scarcely less honored than those of the venerated dead \u2014 whose long, steady, successful course of professional or of learned labor, was crowned by the universal and affectionate veneration of their countrymen. But if turning our view from external circumstances of wealth or of respect, we look to the influence of such a temper upon charac ter and happiness, the contrast is still more striking. On the one side are domestic quiet, calm content, cheerful industry, well employed days and peaceful nights, and above all, a steady reliance on your own exertions \u2014 under the care of Heaven, the true secu rity of independence and the best guarantee of vir-"], [54, "46 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF tue. Yet all this our youth are seen throwing aside to take in exchange the feversh excitement of the gambler, now elated into wild exultation, now harassed by doubt and fears, now weighed down by mortification, disappointment, and sorrow of heart \u2014 ay, and to take the gambler's hazardous, precarious fortunes too, his frequent, sudden and dreadful fluctu ations from wealth to poverty, from power and splen dor to beggary, a state of mind and of fortune leaving no room for domestic happiness, little for personal independence, hardly any for steady, straight-forward honesty. Nor let the young man flatter himself with the false hope, that all this is but for a time, and that when his fortunes are made, he will rest in safety. If he starts into life, risking every thing upon hazards like these, he is a doomed man. He must go on to the end of life as he begun. His early habits are incongruous with the calm, unex citing details of ordinary life, and render his mind eventually incompetent for the ordinary duties of society. Against this danger there is but one sure safe guard of intellectual discipline. Religious and moral duty may indicate others. I am far from advising a timid abstinence from any creditable or honest undertaking that may offer strong in ducements to enter upon it. Such advice would be"], [55, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 47 idle and ineffectual, if it were in other respects wise, and it is not wise in the times and country in which we live. The intellectual safe-guard I would re commend is simply this : \u2014 to form your permanent habits and tastes to some study, some business, some profession, of common and constant utility: to become masters of this, familiar with it, fond of it. If afterwards more exciting avocations call you off for a time, to this you may always look as the agreeable and respectable employment of your pros perous leisure, and upon this you may fall back in adversity, with the certainty of finding a sure pro tection for your honor, your independence, and your virtue. There is another fault with which our country has been sometimes reproached, and this reproach, to which I have already alluded, much exaggerated as it is, is not without some foundation in reality. This degree of reality is again another of the evils that may befal the American scholar, and against which it most behooves him to guard. It has been said by shrewd though unfriendly observers, that in America the practical and the profitable swallow up every other thought. There, say they, fancy withers, art languishes, taste expires ; there the mind looks only to the material and the mechanical, and loses its capacity for the ideal and the abstract ; the sensuous"], [56, "48 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF understanding is vigorous, the pure reason is torpid and blind. It might seem that there were very little reason to complain of our lot, if our nation effects every thing it attempts in the useful and practical ; and that the ideal and the abstract might will be left to others who have less of solid and material con solation. Yet I think not exactly so ; and, first wholly protesting against the sweeping broadness of the charge \u2014 am willing to confess, that the American mind is peculiarly exposed to suffer in this very way. The demands upon talent for active service are so numerous and imperative, the compen sation and rewards for such service are so imme diate and tempting, that the educated man is induced naturally to value the worth of knowledge by its direct utility. This is not amiss in itself, if it stop there, but he is often led on to take another step, and measure the degree of that utility by its value to his own interests \u2014 thus paring down utility to mere selfishness, and that too most commonly the selfishness of the coarsest and meanest material interests. To this, there are, it must be confessed, stronger temptations here than in other countries. On the other hand, there are here also stronger in ducements to a more liberal habit of thought and a more generous course of action. If the facilities of advancing our personal interests are here numerous"], [57, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 49 and absorbing, so again those interests will here be found to be peculiarly bound up and interwoven with those of our country and our neighbor. The prosperity of each man depends upon the prosperity of all. Every active citizen feels that he partakes largely of the practical and real, as well as of the theoretical sovereignty, and may make his own cha racter and influence felt far and near. For the same reason, in all the operations of private enterprise, and in our public concerns, as the laws and principles regulating their action are evolved and manifested, even enlightened self-interest is constantly called to look to something loftier and more lasting than its own direct and immediate objects. Thus whilst the intelligent American citizen is surrounded by the strongest temptations to devote himself solely to selfish pursuits, he is at the same time every where invited to conform his own spirit to that of our liberal institutions, and instructed to uplift his mind to the consideration of large principles, and to re gard himself as being but a small part of the vast whole which claims his best affections. With such a choice before him, pitiable indeed is the lot of him who turns from the nobler and manlier side, to think, to live, and to drudge for him self alone. He cuts himself off from the best de- lights of the heart\u2014 its endearing charities and its 7"], [58, "50 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF elevating sympathies. He paralyzes his own intel lect by suffering it to become half dead through in action, and that in its nobler parts. The mighty ladder of thought and reason, reaching from the visi ble to the invisible \u2014 from the crude knowledge gained through the senses to the sublimest infer ences of the pure reason \u2014 from the earth to the very footstool of God's own throne \u2014 is before him and invites his ascent. But he bends his eyes obsti nately downwards upon the glittering ores at his feet, until he loses the wish or the hope for any thing better. This, however, is but an extreme case, to be pointed out as a beacon to mark the covert peril. That such grovelling materiality, such mean selfish ness, is not the necessary, nor the constant, no, nor the frequent result of our ardent industry in the affairs of life, let the discoveries of Franklin, and the magnificent far-drawn speculations of Edwards \u2014 let the grand philosophy, and the poetic thought, flashing quick and thick through the cloudy atmos phere of political discussion in our senate-house \u2014 let the open-handed charity, the more than princely munificence, the untiring personal labors of bene volence, exhibited by our most devoted and success ful men of business, bear splendid testimony. There is yet a danger of quite another sort, that"], [59, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 51 with us sometimes besets and misleads the literary man. Familiarized from youth with the glories and beauties of European literature, his ambition is early fired to imitate or to rival its excellence. He forms to himself grand plans of intellectual exploits, all of them probably incongruous with the state and taste of his country, and most of them doubtless beyond his own ability. The embryo author projects epic poems, and in the mean while executes sonnets in quantities ; the artist feeds his imagination with ideal historical compositions on the scale and above the ex cellence of those of Raphael ; the young orator dreams of rivalling the younger Pitt, and of ruling the nation by his eloquence, at the age of four-and twenty. These enthusiasts enter the living world, and soon find that their expectations are but a dream. They discover either that the world rates their talent very differently from their own estimate of it, or else that the state of society about them is wholly adverse to its exercise in the direction or on the scale their ambitious fancy had anticipated. The coarse matter-of-fact character of our world begins to disgust them. They see duller school-fellows outstrip them in worldly success. They see the honors and profits of public office bestowed upon some whom they know to be un worthy. The profits of trade and speculation are gathered before their eyes by the unlettered."], [60, "52 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF Disappointed and disgusted, they are now tempted to ascribe their disappointment to the republican in stitutions of their country ; not reflecting that it is im possible to enjoy all kinds of good at the same time ; that whatever is administered by men must be sub ject to abuse ; and that to be happy and success ful, every man must some how or other conform him self to the sphere where Providence has placed him. If the scholar gives way to this temptation, he becomes a discordant, jarring thing in society, har monizing with nothing near or around him. He dwells with a sort of complacent disgust upon every imperfection of our social state. He gradu ally becomes a rebel in heart to our glorious institu^ tions. His affections and secret allegiance transfer themselves to some other form of government and state of society, such as he dreams to have formed the illustrious men and admirable things of his favorite studies \u2014 forms of government or states of society, such as he knows only by their accidental advantages without a glimpse of their real and terri ble evils. When this mental disease, for so it may be called without a metaphor, seizes irrecoverably upon the thoughts of the retiring, the sensitive, and timid lover of books and meditation, his capacity for useful exertion is ended ; he is thenceforward doomed to lead"], [61, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 53 a life of fretful restlessness alternated with queru lous dejection. On the other hand, should he be naturally a man of firmer temperament and sounder discretion, time and experience will sober down his fancies, and make him join in the labors of life with cool submission. Still he is in danger of being a soured and discontented man, occasionally com pelled to feign what he does not feel, and always unsustained by that glad confidence, that eager zeal and gay hope, which ever cheer him who loves and honors his country, feels her manifold blessings, and is grateful for all of them. As various bodily diseases are observed to be spe cially incident to their several particular arts, trades, and professions, so the malady I have just described seems in this country to be that to which men of purely literary cultivation are specially predisposed. The men of daily toil seem happily to live quite below the level of its agency, those of abstract in quiry, of mathematical study, physical observation and high science, as much above it. The early history of American literature affords a distinguished example of this influence upon a most elegant, accomplished and brilliant mind. So modern are our American antiquities, that much of this early history is within the memory of men not beyond the middle of life, and such it happens to be"], [62, "54 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF in this instance. It is that of one once called the American Addison, and still justly regarded as a father of our native literature, the late Joseph Dennie. Nature had endowed him with the quickest taste for beauty, the keenest sensibility for all intel lectual excellence. A scholar from his cradle, he became very soon, by practice, \" a ripe and good one.\" His ready memory was stored to a degree unequalled by any one on this side the Atlantic, and surpassed by none on the other, except his contem porary, the celebrated Porson . It was filled, crowded, bursting with the choicest beauties of thought, the rarest gems of expression that refined taste could se lect from the most extensive range of reading. He united to this reading much originality of thought, a gay and sportive fancy, and an unsurpassed power of brilliant expression. He was a genuine enthusiast in his love of literature, and he made it the pleasure and the business of his life to propagate the same taste among his countrymen. In this he achieved much, but he would have accomplished very far more, had he not yielded to a strange, unwise and unhappy morbid dislike for the institutions and social order of his own country. This discolored his views and distorted his judgment. It enabled inferior, every-day men, to vex and thwart him in his best and most favorite de signs. It abridged the influence of his opinions and"], [63, "55 THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. of his taste, and broke down the authority of his criticism and his example. Worst of all, it iden tified in the minds of the unlettered, the cause of elegant literature with that of attachment to foreign principles and establishments, and contempt for our own. Honest men reasoned, and correctly too, though from false premises, that if literature could be gained only at the expense of patriotic feel ing, it is best that we should go without it. It lessen ed too the merit and value of his writings as literary compositions ; for it tended to strip them of the ori ginal American air they would otherwise have had, and to give them the common cast of mere English literature. Hence, instead of ranking with those of Irving, at the head of our literature, both in time and in merit, his works are already passing into oblivion. The same perverse prejudice had also, I fear, an un happy effect upon the regular activity of his intellect and the course of his life. Peace to his spirit, and gratitude for his services to our commonwealth of letters at a time when most it wanted aid. But let the student take warning from his great and single error. I would not now have called forth his frailties from the tomb, did I not consider them as affording a most salutary and impressive lesson to the youthful enthusiast.

It is the happy privilege of Americans to be free from the necessity of miserable dependance upon the caprice of other men for their daily subsistence or enjoyments. An honorable pride of character is native to our soil. Our reason and our conscience are our own. No man need to seek for himself a master, no man need to fawn upon a patron. Yet another danger, similar in effect to that from which we are thus exempt, yet quite opposite in its cause, threatens our mental liberty. It is that of slavery, not to one but to many, not to a patron but to a party. In our popular form of government, the existence of organized parties for the promotion of any system of policy, for the success of any principles of admi nistration on which opinions are divided, and even for local objects and questions that must be decided ultimately by the ballot-boxes and legislative action, seems to be unavoidable, and when confined to their legitimate sphere, not only harmless but salutary."], [65, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 57 They keep up a more constant and exciting interest in public affairs through the whole community. They lead to a more vigilant watchfulness of those intrusted with power. They give greater stability and regularity to the action of government, and pre serve it from becoming the sport of accident and caprice. But no dispassionate man, who examines the character of all our political parties for the last few years, can fail to perceive that there is some thing in their organization threatening to defeat the primary object of their own formation, and injurious to personal honor and independence. The rule of a majority of the people is the fun damental law of our institutions, and the will of the people has a right to be expressed on every question. But the modern doctrine loses sight of the people as a whole, and substitutes for loyalty to the people, fealty to party. It teaches the true liege-men of fac tion to move together with the discipline and blind obedience of a regular army, and to regard those who do not act with them, not as republican fellow citizens who differ from them in opinion on some secondary though important points, but as aliens and enemies, persons not entitled to any weight in the nation, whose approval of the course of one of our friends is a good ground of suspecting his fidelity, and to act with whom, though on an insulated ques- 8"], [66, "58 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF tion and for obvious public good, is treason and de- sertion. We must add to this, that by the decision of party, is meant that of a bare majority of the party only, or more commonly that of its prominent leaders, assisted by a few active professional partisan politicians. Thus the preferences of the rest, cor- responding perhaps with a very large majority of the whole people numerically, are swallowed up in party allegiance. The result of all this is, that in a land of professed equal rights, one large portion of the citizens is politically disfranchised, until they can by the same discipline acquire power, and then disfran- chise their opponents. Under a constitution pro- fessing the wfll of the majority to be the supreme law, the most vital questions are settled by an active bold minority. Connected with all this, and as a most essential ingredient in the system, a bitter spirit of intolerance is nursed up, unjust to the mo- tives of adversaries, degrading to public men, and engendering narrow jealousies among the people. The public man is taught in his official character to look not to the welfare or the judgment of the peo- ple as a whole, but (what should be wholly subordi- nate) to the success and approbation of his party. Thus, means usurp the place of ends. The first who suffer the just punishment of this moral treason, for such it is, against republican principles, are the"], [67, "THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 59 successful leaders themselves. They deprive them selves at once of the honest enthusiasm, the cheerful confidence that ever accompany the zealous support of principles. They become the timid, temporizing slaves of expediency, looking at every step, not to its justice or wisdom, but to its probable popularity. Their own policy prevents them from relying for re spect and support upon the broad judgment of all honest and enlightened men, and when age or ad versity arrives, when \" interest calls off all her sneak ing train,\" they are left helpless and contemptible.

Strange thing it is, but true, that in this our re public, the land of abundance, the native soil of in dependence, there may be found some Americans of talent and information as abject in the submis sion of their understanding and will to the dictation of another, as was ever the most awe-struck cour tier of Louis XIV. or the Czar, and who can fawn"], [68, "60 THE ADVANTAGES AND DANGERS OF upon the dispensers of office with a cringing ser vility that would have mantled with shame the cheek of the worst hireling of Walpole, or the most profli gate parasite of Dubois, the scandal of the church, or of Jefteries, the reproach of the law. I have before said that I looked with undoubting confidence to the ultimate tendency of our free institutions, to elevate and purify the general mind. Nor do these things shake me in that conviction. They are but for a time. These dark clouds will pass away. They cannot quench the glorious sun of our republic. To-morrow \u2014 To-morrow, he repairs his golden beams, And floods the nation with redoubled ray. But their time is now. The evils are present. They are confined to no individuals, to no one party or faction. I have even feared that this spirit of in tolerance and dictation was extending itself from the political into the social and the religious world. Even before the altars of the Most High, strange and unhallowed fires have been lighted up in the priest's censers. It is for our generous, educated, high-minded youth to stay this plague.

Be your zeal as fer vent as it may, still temper it with a kind-hearted tolerance for the sincere and the honest. Reserve your warmest indignation for the narrow and bitter Pharisee, whether for you or against you, for the hypo crite, the impostor, and the persecutor. Above all, reverence yourself, your country, and the principles for which you contend. Never sacrifice your own honor, and still less, the cause of religion or freedom, to the subsidiary means designed to promote them, or the external forms in which they may be invested.
